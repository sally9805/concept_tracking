Tuesday , July 14 , 1868 . THE Democrats and conservatives do not yet get reconciled to the New York nominations . It was undoubtedly a mistake , but they must support it as preferable to Grant in his ignorance , and radicalism in its wickedness . It will not do to sacrifice the country from mere prejudice against or partiality for men . I judge from what I hear that Chase and his friends felt a degree of confidence that he would be the nominee . He had , I have no doubt , the money interest in his favor . . When I went to Cabinet to-day , only Seward was in the Council room . He said , jocosely , that he understood I was for the New . York nominations and he opposed to them . Said the papers so stated . I observed that I had not seen the statement , but I had no hesitation in saying I was opposed to Grant and the radicals , and , consequently , I had , under the circumstances , no alternative but to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression , but without success . Friday , July 17 , 1868 . The President read a veto which he had prepared on the Edmunds bill excluding certain States from casting electoral votes , or preventing them from being counted . The veto is very well done and is the President 's own work . He afterwards laid before us a mes sage suggesting sundry alterations of the Constitution . I was uncomfort. able while it was being read , and I could perceive it was a favored bantling which he had prepared with some care . Seward , at once , on its conclusion , met the subject frankly and can . didly . Said he made no objection to the document as an exhibit , as the President 's own personal views , but he did object to its being given out as an administrative or Cabinet paper . He could readily assent to some of the propositions , to others he could not , and as a general thing did not admire changes of the fundamental law . He did not wish the Presidential term length . ened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to re-elect . McCulloch said as a general thing he was against constitutional changes , but thought it well for the President to present his views . He rather liked ex. tending the term . Browning had never given the subject much thought , but was favorably impressed with the suggestions that were made . Schofield and Randall said very little I concurred generally in the remarks of Seward , but excepted , which he did not , to the encroachments proposed to be made on the federation features of our system . I was not for taking from the States the single sovereign vote in case there was no election on the first trial . // Tuesday , July 21 , 1868 . Mr. Evarts appeared in Cabinet Council to-day for the first time . He arrived in Washington on Sunday . This appointment makes Seward potent beyond what he has hitherto been with the President , but that fact will not strengthen the administration . Neither of the political parties likes Seward . He is disliked by both , has not public confidence , and there is no affection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see this , nor will he ; but from this time forward he will probably be too much under the combined influence of his Secretary of State and Attorney-General . Monday , July 87 , 1868 . There was little to interest during the closing hours of the session ? less excitement than usual , and more of the great absorbing constitutional struggle , ? such as I have sometimes seen in other years . Statesmanship was wanting . The members talked and acted as if in a village caucus . Petty intrigues , tricks , and contrivances to help the party were the great end and aim . Instead of the usual adjournment sine die to meet at the regular session in December , Congress took what they call a recess until the 21st of September . This was a scheme to cheat the Constitution and innovate on the executive prerogative , for it is the President 's duty to convene Congress , if public necessity requires . But it was not pretended there was any public necessity . The recess was to prolong the session , and watch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There being no cause for assembling , the radical members , before leaving , knowing that an extra session was unnecessary , signed a paper to the purport that they would not convene in September until called together by E. D. Morgan , Senator , and Schenck , Representative . These two men are chairmen of the radical party committees of their respective Houses , and on them was conferred the executive authority of calling an extra session for party purposes . Such is radical legislation and radical government . Thursday , September 17 , 1898 . The returns from Maine give a very decided victory to the radicals . The Democrats have , it is true , greatly increased their vote but so have the radicals also . All their members of Congress are elected . Saturday , October 8 , 1868 . The country is absorbed with politics and parties . More of the latter than the former . Speakers are overrunning the country with their hateful harangues and excitable trash . I read but few of the speeches . Those of the radicals are manufactured , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material : hatred of the rebels , revenge , the evils of reconciliation , the dangers to be apprehended if the whites of the South are not kept under , the certainty that they will , if permitted to enjoy their legitimate constitutional rights , control the government , in which event the radicals will be deprived of power . This is the stuff of which every radical oration is made , interlarded sometimes with anecdotes . No allusion to the really great questions before the country ? the rights of man , ? the rights of the States , ? the grants and limitations of the Constitution . Had the Democrats made a judicious nomination they would have enlisted the good sense and patriotism of the people , and had an easy victory . As it is they have given the radicals every advantage and , of course , are likely to suffer a terrible defeat . At all events things appear so to me . IN A DIARY OF THE RECONSTRUCTION PERIOD Saturday , October 10 , 1868 . A letter from General Schofield to General Grant , congratulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is published . It was written last May and confirms my impression that Grant was consulted by Fessenden and Grimes , and participated in making Schofield a Cabinet officer . Schofield , like Grant , is shrewd , and in the civil service acts with a view to his own interest in all he does . This is the fact as regards both . They each have astuteness ? a certain kind of ability . Schofield is much the best informed of the two , but Grant has more obstinacy and self-will . It was natural enough for Schofield to ally himself to his superior in command . Most of the army officers would be apt to do it . There is not , however , much enthusiasm for Grant . He has not many warm personal friends . Sherman is quite devoted to him , ? sincerely , I think , ? others because he is the lucky man , in place , and the Democratic nomination renders Grant 's election almost certain . The elections will , I think , be adverse to the Democrats next Tuesday ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I fear , awaits our country . Sectional hate will be established . Wednesday , October 14 , 1868 . The President says this a ' . M. that he has no definite news , nothing more than is in the papers . No one sends to him . Heretofore he has always had friendly telegrams giving results . He says Randall called just before I did , and was feeling very blue , and when he left said he would telegraph Tilden to get Seymour out of the way . It was pretty evident , the President said , that the present ticket could have little hope . Although guarded in his remarks , I could perceive the President was not greatly displeased with the turn things were taking , and I think began to have hopes that attention may yet be turned to himself . But his intimacy with and support of Seward forecloses , if nothing else would , any such movement . On that rock he split . It was Seward who contributed to the retention of Stanton ; it was Seward who counselled him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seward who broke down his administration ; it was Seward who drove from him the people . The Pmsident is bold and firm , when he has come to a decision , but is not always prompt in reaching it . The people would have stood by him against the usurping Congress , had he squarely met them at first and asserted the rights of the Executive and the Constitution . Friday , October 43 , 1868 At the Cabinet meeting General Schofield read a letter from the Governor of Arkansas expressing great apprehension of trouble from the people who are armed , and requesting that he might have U. S. arms that are in the Arsenal to put in the hands of the mi. litia . General Schofield was very earnest in this matter , said the opponents of the Governor were rebels who retained their arms when Kirby Smith surrendered , that they are organized , and unless something was done , the loyal men would be overpowered and killed by the Ku-Klux . After hear . ing him for some time and a few commonplace expressions of concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was afraid of the people of Arkansas , if General Schofield advised the arming of the Governor 's party ) against their opponents , ? the people of that State . In other words , is popular government a failure in Arkansas : General Schofield said that he and the military gentlemen generally had believed there was but one way to establish the reconstruction of the states // south , and that was by martial law . I asked how long martial law should be continued . He said until those governments were able to sustain themselves . ' Do you mean by that , ' I enquired , until the black and the ignorant element controls the intelligent white population ? ' The General said he was not a politician , nor intending to discuss the subject politically ; he was describing practically how these governments were to be maintained . ' And you come to the conclusion that form is requisite ? ' said I. Then he said he knew no other way to keep down the rebels . ' Then , ' said McCulloch , if I understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure . The people in those States are incapable of seit.government . ' Browningsaid theremust be a standing army to carry out the radical policy , and it would have to be kept up through all time . All agreed that it was not best to let the governor have the arms of his party . Seward proposed U. S. troops to Arkansas . This Schofield thought would perhaps answer , if we had the troops , but we had not got them . He urged that General Smith , commanding , might be authorized to issue arms if he thought it necessary . After a long and earnest , but not satisfactory discussion , the compromise of Seward was adopted by Schofield , who proposed to order the twelfth regiment , stationed here in Washington , to proceed to Memphis , and by the time they reached that point , it could be determined what disposition should be made of them . Tuesday , November 17 , 1868 . Exhausted and fatigued with office la ' bor during the day and with preparing my annual report and receiving corn ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this book for some time . But events of interest have transpired , and I regret that I did not from day to day make at least a brief memorandum . There was excitement over the election , but acquiescence in the declared result . In New York and Philadelphia there was a great outcry of fraud by the radicals , who , as a party , now as in other days and under other names , are given to frauds . They denounce the vote of intelligent whites of foreign birth , while they illegally and by fraud polled hundreds of thousands of ignorant Negro votes . The defeat of Seymour did not surprise me . There has been mismanagement and weakness on the part of the Democratic leaders , if nothing worse . In nominating Seymour the war issue was unavoidably raised , and the Democrats have been busy in trying to make people believe Seymour to have been a good war man . They did not convince the voters , nor believe their own assertions . Grant has returned to Washington after loitering away several months in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominated . Colfax has been back here also . He and Wade have again adjourned Congress , ? a mockery upon the Constitution and honest government . A dinner is given by the New York bar to Attorney-General Everts this evening , to which all the Cabinet men were invited . I omitted writing the Committee until Saturday evening . McCulloch and Randall did not write until yesterday . The others wrote a week ago , declining . The papers state that Grant , who is in New York , declines to attend , if Secretaries McCulloch and Welles and P. M. General Randall are to be present . This announcement , publicly made , is from his factotum , Adam Badeau , but by Grant 's authority . 122 A DIARY OF THE RECONSTRUCTION PERIOD Wednesday , December 9 , 1868 . As I anticipated , Congress ventilated its rage against the President . His message in its soundest portions annoyed them . They felt his rebuke and knew they deserved it . Conness , who is innately vulgar , Cameron , who is an unconscionable party trickster , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had their sensibilities aroused . The President had no business to insult Congress by communicating his opinions . It was indecorous to the Senate , and they would not permit it to be read . So they adjourned in a huff . The House permitted the message to be read , and then denounced it as infamous , abominable , wicked . Schenck the leader was against printing , and others of about the same calibre ranted . They attacked most violently that part which suggests payment of the bonds , not in conformity with the original understanding . It is the most weak and indefensible portion of the message . Thursday , December 10 , 1868 . The Senators have recovered their senses , and quietly submitted to the reading of the message after an exhibition of folly and weakness that would discredit a party caucus . All seemed ashamed . The House , however , prints only the legal number of the message and documents ? no extras . These displays of puerile anger by the legislative body are ridiculous . Saturday , December 19 , 1868 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and also in the newspapers . Almost the whole that I see is crude absurdity . Morton of Indiana has submitted propositions and made a speech which exhibit some ingenuity and talent , but , if sincere , they evince little financial knowledge or ability . There are some clever things , of course . I do not , I confess , read much of the shallow , silly trash that appears M the debates , ? there is not so far as I can perceive a single financial mind in Congress . Most of the editors are per . feet blockheads on the subject . The more ignorant give us the most words . Senator Doolittle is beginning to bestow attention on financial matters . He made some enquiries of me this evening . I told him I had given the subject very little thought for years . It has been painful for me to do so , from the time Chase commenced issuing irredeemable paper and making it a legal tender for debt . Where the crude , un . wise and stupid management of party schemers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have no fixed standard of value . Everything is uncertain . There is a redundant currency , all of irredeemable paper , and the radical leaders may at any time increase it and make what is bad worse . There is no coin in circulation . In this , as in almost everything else , the country is drifting and the government and all sound principles are likely to be wrecked . Morton is said to be fishing for the Treasury , but it would be a source of regret to see him appointed Secretary , yet I know not who Grant can select . There is talk of E. B. Washburne , who has no capacity for the place . He can , and so could any thickheaded numskull , oppose appropriations without judgment or discrimination , but this affectation of economy from a notoriously mean man , is no qualification for a financier . The whole pack of radicals are , as I expected they would be , fierce in their denunciations of the President for his suggestions , yet many of their leaders have made quite as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although his financial scheme renders him liable to be so represented . // I was sorry he made it . His scheme is virtually a plan to extinguish the public debt by paying the interest for sixteen years and a fraction . But the creditors are entitled to the principal . If our financiers will bring around specie payments the debt can be re-spec duced ; loans at reduced rates could be negotiated to advantage . But there is no proposition yet made to effect the first , and until that is done we can not expect to accomplish the other . So long as the Government discredits its own paper , there will be no resumption of specie payments . The first step to be taken is to stop the issuing of any more fractional currency . Call it in , burn it up . The vacuum will be supplied by specie , which will come when invited , treated respectfully and according to its worth . Let the second step be a prohibition against all paper money below five dollars . This might be gradual . Coin would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and demand in this as in other matters will regulate themselves . These steps can not be taken without an effort . Values are to be effected and prices brought to a proper standard . I They are now inflated . We are not to get a return to specie payments without some embarrassment . But the movement can be made and carried much sooner and easier than is supposed . Senator Morton 's plan of hoarding specie until 1871 is ridiculously absurd . Instead of hoarding in the vaults of the Treasury and the banks , let it go into the pockets of the people when demanded for ordinary business trans -- actions . Then there will be a basis for resumption . The gold and silver would be retained in the country , for here the demand would be greatest , until there was a supply . To discredit its own paper , compel it to be received as money and in payment of debt , and sell the specie which it collects , is bad government . While this practice is pursued we can not expect resumption . Our wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strain or pressure on the public , but they are careful to fix a distant day , and before it arrives they know and intend it shall be further postponed and abandoned . If they would forbear persecution , hate , and oppression of the South , let war cease when none but themselves make war , give us real peace , instead of constant strife , develop the resources of the country , that will contribute to the restoration of confidence and a stable currency . Tuesday . December 29 , 1868 . Quite a discussion took place on the subject of the currency at the Cabinet meeting . The President insisted , positively and with sincerity , that specie payment might be resumed to-morrow without difficulty or derangement . Although believing that gold and silver , like other commodities , are regulated by demand and supply , provided there were no paper substitute , I could not assent to the feasibility of an immediate resumption without causing some embarrassment . It might be less perhaps than was generally believed , but whenever we did return to a specie standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to restoration after a plethora . McCulloch came in while we were discussing the subject , and he and the President soon became engaged in conversation ? the President laying down certain propositions which I did not perhaps fully comprehend , to the effect , if I understood him , that if twenty-five per cent of the greenbacks were redeemed at once , their place would be immediately supplied with gold . McCulloch controverted this , said the customs barely yielded sufficient coin to pay accruing 194 A DIARY OF THE RECONSTRUCTION PERIOD interest and the requisitions of the State and Navy departments . To resume at once , therefore , he declared an impossibility . The greenbacks and paper must be gradually retired , and had not Congress improperly interfered and prevented the withdrawal of greenbacks , we should at this time have been near the point of resumption , The President insisted resumption could just as well take place now as if the withdrawal had gone on . Schofield protested it would be most unjust to the whole debtor class to resume without previous notice . I asked if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by cheapening the currency by which they received really but seventy cents on the dollar . This view completely stumped Schofield , who evidently had thought and talked on only one side of the question . This subject is one of absorbing interest , and its rightful solution is of the utmost importance . It must necessarily be attended with some hardships , but less I apprehend than is generally believed . The great body of the supporters of Grant are not hard-money men . They belong mostly to the old Whig party , and while full of expedients have no sound or fixed principles on currency , finance or any other subject . If Grant has any views in regard to currency or finance they are not avowed or declared . I doubt if he has any , and should feel quite as well satisfied to know that he had none as that he had , for he may , provided he is well advised , fall into a correct train , if not already committed to some one or more of the many wild and vague theories that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my apprehensions are that his notions are crude , and that from ignorant obstinacy he will be likely to aggravate existing evils . The country needs at this time a firm , intelligent and able executive , and he should be sustained in whole . some efforts by a decisive congressional . majority . A wise policy persistently adhered to is wanted . The standard or measure of value must be maintained to insure stability and confidence . Wednesday . December 30 , 1868 . There was , last evening , an inter . esting party of two or three hundred young folks at the Presidential man . sion , called thither to meet the grandchildren of the President in a social dance . It was the President 's birthday ; he being sixty years old that day . The gathering was irrespective of parties , and all were joyous and festive . General Grant , the President-elect , would not permit his children to attend this party of innocent youths , manifesting therein his rancorous and bitter personal and party animosity . Saturday . January 8 , 1869 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the President . He says General B. F. Butler called on him yesterday ; Butler also called on me and I believe most of the Cabinet . It was impudent and vulgar to intrude himself on the President , ? the man whom he had vilified , slandered , and abused , for the President could not , if so disposed , treat him as he deserved . Butler undertakes to discriminate between the man and the President ; says he has no controversy or difference with Andrew Johnson , and the Senate , wiser than himself , have acquitted the President of official misconduct with which Butler and his co-conspirators deliberately and maliciously charged him . The President while conversing freely on Butler 's call was careful to express no opinion as to its propriety or otherwise . He says the visit was entirely unexpected , and was prompted as much by the absence of Grant , as a desire to be courteous to him . Tuesday , January 12 , 1889 . Butler , who yesterday carried the repeal of the Tenure-of-Office Bill through the House , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and against specie ; in plain words , a preference of false promises over truth . Irredeemable paper is a lie ; gold is truth . He is a controlling spirit in this Congress , and with the radical party . He is strong-willed , when clothed with power , energetic , cunning , unscrupulous , and consequently , dangerous , potent for goOd sometimes , for evil often . There is very little true wisdom or good sense in the House on matters of currency or finance . Seward had three or four treaties to send up to the Senate . He said with a self-complacent air of triumph that they completed the fifty-sixth which he had concluded ; about as many as had been made during the whole previous existence of the government . I could not resist remarking entangling alliances ' ? our predecessors deemed it wise and prudent to have no more than were absolutely necessary . The remark vexed him . Wednesday , February 10 , 1869 . Congress to-day counted and declared the presidential votes . There was nothing novel or interesting in the proceeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , Grant is elected by illegal votes and fraudulent and unconstitutional practices . He would not have had a vote south of Washington but for the usurping and inexcusable acts of Congress . The folly of the Democrats north in nominating Seymour insured Grant 's election and gave encouragement to the outrageous legislation to help them . Thursday , February 11 , 1869 . It seems there were some not very creditable proceedings in Congress yes- terday when the two Houses were in joint session , followed up by the House after the joint convention was dissolved . The subject has been continued and discussed to-day , though with less heat and rancor . Still there has been sufficient to show the antagonisms in the radical party which must break out before Grant shall have been long in office . The hate between Butler and Bingham is intense . Both are unscrupulous and unprincipled ; both are cunning and adroit . Butler has most talent , most will , most daring and persistency ; Bingham is more subtle and deceptive , has more suavity , is more snaky and timid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Bingham at present . He has also Stanton and Grant , who are too afraid of Butler to support him . The difficulties yesterday grew out of the radical intrigue and villainy to exclude the vote of Georgia , and treat her as out of the Union . These revolutionary and wicked proceedings are having their effect in more ways than one on their authors . I do not see how Grant ? if he has the comprehension , which is doubtful ? can reconcile these differences ; and before his administration will be half served out , serious calamities are likely to befall the country . Friday . February 19 , 1869 . Seward says he intends to leave Washington on the 8th of March and go to Auburn . The President appears to think that the Cabinet should all go out at noon on the 4th of March . This is my wish , and I believe that of most of the members of the Cabinet , and yet there is an apparent impropriety , if not a positive wrong in abandoning our posts until there has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take upon themselves the duties . 126 A DIARY OF THE RECONSTRUCTION PERIOD Saturday , February 80 , 1869 . Had some talk with the President in relation to Inauguration Day . Something was said a few days ago about his going to the Capitol and remaining to the close of the session to sign bills , etc . I advised hiin to do no such thing , but to remain at the White House and discharge his duties there . Unlike proceedings at inaugurals , the next Congress would assemble on the 4th ; there would be no interruption of business . He should therefore put himself to no special inconvenience , and was not requested to do so . Monday , February 88 , 1869 . I enquired how the President was to dispose of himself , if at the Capitol at 12 meridian on the 4th prox . Would he go on the platform with the man who had deceived him . He assured me he would not ; that he would close out his administration in the room where we were . I do not think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others , fond of show and parade , will urge him to form part of the pageant . Tuesday , February 83 , 1869 . I asked Seward , whom I found in the Council room alone this noon , when he proposed to leave the Cabinet and Washington . He said his resignation would take effect at noon on the 4th of March , and that he should leave Washington that day . This would be personally agreeable to me , but I queried as to the propriety of abandoning our posts before our successors appeared , and were qualified . Monday , March I , 1869 . The Committee have of course been embarrassed how to proceed , and have finally a programme studiously arranged , which is for the President and President-elect to proceed in separate carriages . The President will pays through Pennsylvania Avenue , on the right , the President-elect , on the left , etc. , etc . Seward and Evarts opened the subject of the procession and our attendance , and had evidently had some understanding with each other and with the Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know but they had intended to shut us off entirely , but since they have been polite enough to provide us a place , he believed he would remain over another day to perform his part . Evarts thought it best we should go in the procession , and he made enquiry about carriages . The President brought out a letter he had from the Marshal , enquiring about carriages informally . I expressed a hope the President would perform no part in the parade , and advised he should remain at the Mansion until meridian , ready to discharge any and all duties . At that time his functions would cease , and ours would cease with his . I asked whenever before there had been such a programme . Two processions , one on each side of the street ! What did it indicate , but division , and what would the effect be , but to irritate and promote hostility ? I dis . claimed any neglect , or want of courtesy ; but on the other hand , I would submit to none . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 , 1869 . At the Cabinet much time was con. sumed as to the course to be pursued on the 4th . Seward and Evarts were determined that the President and Cabinet should go to the Capitol and take part in the proceedings . I combatted this course , but no one sustained me except Randall , who , near the close , expressed a hope that the President would do nothing derogatory to him . self and his position . // Evarts had the matter much at heart , and he and Seward proceeded to dispose of it as a matter of course and as if nothing further was to be said . They assumed for granted that things must be as they wished and directed . Wednesday , March 3 , 1869 . Went with the Chiefs of Bureaus and officers to the Executive Mansion to introduce each and give all an opportunity to bid the Chief Magistrate farewell . Rear Admiral Joe Smith , the senior officer , who eight years ago , as now , walked by my side , then addressed President Lincoln , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convulsion , ? that we navy officers will perform our duty , and expect you to do yours . ' I now introduced the officers to President Johnson with the remark , that these are the men who in war and peace have stood first by the Government and the Union . He received each cordially , took each by the hand and bade them farewell . On returning to the Department , the Chiefs of Bureaus , the clerks , messengers and employees came successively to take their leave , and express their regard and kind wishes for me and my future welfare . It was something besides mere formality . Some , more sensitive perhaps than others , or possessed of deeper feelings , were unable to give utterance to their thoughts ; others with tears expressed their regrets and spoke of lasting obligations . I , not less than they , was moved . Ties of friendship , formed and many of them continued through eight active and eventful years , can not be easily and lightly severed or forgotten . It was past four , when , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room and the building where I had labored earnestly and zealously , taken upon myself and carried forward great responsibilities , endured no small de gree of abuse , much of it unmerited and undeserved , where also I have had many pleasant and happy hours in the enjoyment of the fruits of my works and of those associated with me . Thursday , March 4 , 1869. 1 went at nine this morning to the Executive Mansion , agreeably to appointment at the last Cabinet meeting . There was quite a crowd on the portico and walks as I drove up and entered . Schofield was already in the Council room , having preceded my arrival a few moments . The President was busy examining and signing bills . As I shook hands with him , he said quietly , ' I think we will finish our work here without going to the Capitol . ' The President now said he thought it but right that the Congress should forward the bills to him here . This I knew would be a disappointment to my colleagues , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring around a different result . Randall , who came next after me , was very well satisfied . Schofield discreetly said nothing , but I could perceive he was not pleased with the new phase of affairs . McCulloch was disappointed and disturbed . Browning said not a word . Evarts who did not come in until about ten was determined to change the programme ; said the understanding was that we should go to the Capitol , that we were expected there . When the President accidentally left the room , McCulloch twice told Evarts that the President would not go to the Capitol unless he put in strong for him to do so . Evarts would not take off his overcoat . Seward came in last , smoking his cigar . Asked if all were ready ? meant to have come sooner ? seemed to suppose we were waiting for him . The President continued busy at his desk , while Seward , Evarts and others talked . At length Seward , who sat on the op- 128 A DIARY OF THE RECONSTRUCTION PERIOD posite side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be late , ought we not to start immediately ? The President said he was inclined to think we would finish up our work now by ourselves . They were discomfited , of course , and it was easy to perceive they thought me the author of their disappointment . A few minutes past twelve the President said we would part . As he was to leave , it was proposed that we should wait his departure . He then shook hands with each of us , and we with each other , and , descending to the portico , where our respective carriages were waiting , the President entered his . Mine followed , and we drove away . At my house were the President 's daughter , Mrs. Patterson , and her children who had come over in the morning . They propose to remain with us a few days before going to Tennessee . The proceedings at the Capitol are represented to have been without order or system , and the immense crowd swayed and pushed aside the dignitaries . I am more than ever gratified that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1869 . It is obviously a Grant Cabinet . The members belong to the radical Republican party , but neither one , unless it be Creswell , ' would have been selected by that party . They are not the men the radicals wanted , but they are such men as Grant wants . Washburne 2 is coarse , comparatively illiterate , a demagogue without statesmanship or enlarged views , with none of the accomplishments or attributes that should belong to a Secretary of State . Jefferson is the first , Washburne is the last . Hamilton , a man of talents 1 J. A. J. Creswell , Postmaster-General. 2 E. B. Washburne , Secretary of State for a brief period . and genius , was the first Secretary of the Treasury . He had financial skill and ability to develop the re . sources of the nation . Stewart , ' the last Secretary of the Treasury , has made a princely fortune in the trade of silks , calicoes , laces , and stockings . So of the others . From first to last there is not an experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them are party men . All are Grant men . Cres. well was a secessionist in 1861 , and , like Logan , raised a company to resist the Unionists . There is not now a more bitter and intolerant radical in the country , but his radicalism is obsequis ous and subservient to Grant . The radicals are astounded , thunder . struck , mad , but after taking breath , try to reconcile themselves and be corn . posed that things are no worse , that Grant has not , besides kicking them one side , selected Democrats . In this is consolation . They therefore try to praise the Cabinet and like it . The ad. ministration is to be Grant 's , based on radical usurpations . Both parties are to be bamboozled , and if Grant really has any policy , which I doubt , it is that the animosity of each is to be played off against the other . Saturday , March 6 , 1889 . There is disturbance and trouble in the radical camp . Mr. Stewart is not ready to give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treas. ury . Grant did not know that it was illegal for an extensive importer to be Secretary of the Treasury . A sagacious and honest-minded man would have seen the incompatibility of such a con ? junction , even were there no legal ob . jections . Had Grant been less secretive he would have been wiser . His friends , had he consulted them , would have advised him properly . Stewart of course knew no better . The Senate Alexander T. Stewart . // confirmed Stewart unanimously , supposing , probably , that it was arranged that he should give up his business to take the place . This was the general supposition . But to-day , Grant sends in a special message addressed to the Senate only , asking Congress to permit the newly appointed Secretary of the Treasury to be exempted from the law ; that the most conspicuous case of the propriety and necessity of the law in the whole United States shall be relieved from the disabilities which the law imposes ; that Mr. Stewart , the largest importer , shall have a privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied every other importer . This message is a more conclusive evidence of unfitness , than the ignorance of appointing . Tuesday , March 9 , 1869 . The Int elligencer of this morning contained a very extraordinary leader ? first under its head ? double-leaded ? laudatory of Stewart and Grant , because the former offers to give his income , some two millions a year , to the poor of New York , provided he can thereby be permitted to hold the office of Secretary of the Treasury and manage the finances . Every one on reading the article pronounced the paper purchased . Wednesday , March 10 , 1869 . The papers publish Stewart 's deed of trust , and also his letter declining the office of Secretary of the Treasury . It was found , after enquiry and consultation , that the arrangements would not work , and that the rich man could not buy the place . Thursday , March 11 , 1869 . Grant has finally surrendered and nominated Boutwell 1 for the Treasury . He would not at the beginning give him George S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a measure by the exposure of his ignorance in the first instance ; by his readiness to cheat the law in the second ; third , by his inability to procure a repeal of the enactment , and being finally compelled to withdraw his grossly improper proposition . The radicals have been very clamorous and violent for distinctive recognition as a power , which Grant has tried to evade , but he at last yields . He yields in another respect from his repeated declarations and immovable principles that he would not have two members of his Cabinet from one State . But it is reported that this difficulty will soon be corrected . The Supreme Court is to be enlarged , and Hoar 2 is to be got rid of by being transferred to the Bench . Bargains , intrigues , and arrangements are the order of the day ; the country 's welfare is of little consideration . There is an inaccuracy and readiness in these vicious proceedings which is startling . But the party of moral ideas ' seem to consider the whole thing proper . Hamilton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washburne held the office four days . He could not fill it . Grant told Farragut that he gave Washburne the place as a compliment . That was in character . General Rawlins succeeds Schofield as Secretary of War . Of the three persons who figured not very largely eight years ago in the village of Galena ' but who are now in the most prominent places in the Republic , I have always considered Rawlins as possessing the superior , though not great mind . His health is not good , but I think his influence will be , in the right direction , beneficial for Grant and the administration . 130 A DIARY OF THE RECONSTRUCTION PERIOD Wednesday , March 17 , 1869 . A smart debate took place between Butler and Schenck , neither very scrupulous men . Schenck has perhaps more influence in the House , but Butler knows the most . I , this evening , parted with ex-President Johnson and his family , who leave in the morning for Tennessee . No better persons have occupied the Executive Mansion , and I part from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President , politically and officially , I need not here speak further than to say , he has been faithful to the Constitution , although his administrative capabilities and management may not equal some of his predecessors . Of measures he was a good judge , but not always of men . Saturday , April 17 , 1869 . McCulloch called on me last evening , and regretted that I leave Washington . Thinks I would be better satisfied here than in Hartford , ? for eight years ' separation from old friends at the latter place has weakened and severed most of the ties which once endeared the place , while here I have formed new friendly associations , and am generally known and properly regarded . There is much truth in these remarks , and I feel that I have an ordeal and trial to pass through for a few weeks to come which I would be glad to avoid . Blair was here this evening and expressed himself even warmer and more feelingly on the subject of our approaching separation . I confess to the reluctance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where I have experienced unremitting kindness , and especially from the circle of intimate personal and political friends and associates with whom , through storm and sunshine , through trials and vicissitudes in war and peace , under two administrations , I have had many pleasant and happy , as well as some sad and trying hours . But it is best that the brief span of life that remains to me should be passed in the land of my nativity . I have employed the week in prepar. ation for my departure , gathering up , with my wife and sons , our household effects and making ready to leave . Not a feeling , or one single moment of regret has crossed my mind on relinquishing office . In leaving the cares , responsibilities and labors , which I have borne and tried faithfully to execute , I feel satisfying relief . I miss , it is true , the daily routine , which has become habitual , but the relief from many perplexities more than counterbalances it . My duties were honestly and fearlessly discharged ; these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject . They have passed into history . I look back upon the past eight years of my Washington official life with satisfaction , and a feeling that I have served my country usefully and well . My ambition has been gratified , and with it a consciousness that the labors I have performed , the anxieties I have experienced , the achievements I have been instrumental in organizing and bringing to glorious results , and the great events connected with them , will soon pass in a degree from remembrance , or be only slightly recollected . Transient are the deeds of men , and often sadly perverted and misunderstood .
