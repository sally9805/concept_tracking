txt Lighter Omnibuses Urged . Referring to the present agitation of what is to be done with the Fifth Avenue bus line on Riverside Drive , I would voice the sentiments of many thoughtful observers of how matters have operated for the past year or more . We must all understand , first , that a public conveyance of some kind must continue to have access to our beautiful drive , and all the way up to Inwood , if wanted as far . But have a lighter motor vehicle , one to accommodate not over eight or ten passengers , or about the same as Central Park coaches . and give no permit to any car vehicle carrying a greater number . This course must be adopted , so that roads wilt not be speedily ruined as In the past Then exact a license for each public bus or car , proportioned to wear and tear given the roads by such public vehicles . No heavy double-decker bus should longer be allowed on the drive . FAIR PLAY .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
