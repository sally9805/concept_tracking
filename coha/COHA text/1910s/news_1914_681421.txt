txt Secretary , Therefore , Stops Exposing Offending Institutions  --  Commends New York Banks . Special fo The Neto York Times . ' WASHINGTON , Oct. 6 . ? Secretary ' made a statement to the newspapers this evening from which it appeared that in the financial centres of the country national banks , as a rule , were not charging excessive rates of interest on loans to correspondent banks . Reports to the Secretary show that the prevailing rate of interest in most of the financial centres is 6 per cent . It is set forth that in New York " nearly all loans " to bank correspondents have been made at the uniform rate of 6 per cent This statement is of particular interest in view of the recent accusation of a Southern bank that two banks in New York had charged It interest rates of 7 per cent .. and that the arrangement was of a character that made the rate actually approximate S per cent . This accusation was brought to the attention of the public through the action of Secretary in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wiggin of the New York Clearing House Committee , in which the charge of the Southern bank was mentioned , although the names of the Southern bank and the two New York banks were omitted from the copies of the telegram distributed . Two days later Chairman Wiggin notified Secretary that the accused banks had denied the charge , and at the same time the Controller of the Currency received a letter from the Southern bank acknowledging - that it had been in error and that the New York banks had not charged a higher rate than 6 per cent . Mr. MeAdoo 's announcement follows : The reports thus far received from the national banks in the central reserve cities of New York , Chicago , and St. Louis show that banks in each of these cities have , in exceptional eases . charged their bank correspondents interest as nigh as S per cent per annum . " In New York nearly all loans to bank correspondents were made at the uniform rate of 6 per cent . In Chicago the prevailing rate charged to bank correspondents was 7 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged . In St. Louis , while the maximum rate to bank correspondents was 8 per cent .. the prevailing rates were 6 and 7 per cent . In a few cases loans were being made at lower rates . " In . Boston 7 3-10 per cent . was charged in a few cases , although the prevailing rate was 6 per cent . In Philadelphia the national banks as far as heard from report no loans to bank correspondents in excess of 6 per cent . " I have determined not to Issue for the present any further lists of banks which are carrying excessive reserves and thereby hoarding money and restricting credits , because there is gratifying evidence that the . unwisdom and short-sightedness of this policy is being recognized and that a more sensible . and liberal disposition is being manifested . I have a long list of banks which are holding excessive reserves and I shall not hesitate to publish it if it becomes necessary or desirable in the public interest . " Banks that are hoarding money and restricting credits arc a menace to business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. e granting legitimate credits that the banks which are not should be ex oosed to public view . " New York banks have met and are meeting the situation in a fine and commendable spirit , but their service is neutralized in a considerable measure by those banks which refuse to do their part . Their is evidence in some quarters that individuals and corporations are hoarding money . It is just as reprehensible for them to do so as it is for the banks . There is no reason why people should not deposit money in the banks in the usual way and with absolute confidence , and there is no reason why business should not be conducted in a normal way . There are , of course , some portions of the country where peculiar and difficult conditions prevail  --  for instance . In the cotton States  --  but even there the conditions can be greatly improved if the banks will employ their resources in a reasonable and helpful way . " Banks that are charging exorbitant rates of interest are simply taking advantage of the necessities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought to my notice the interest rate has been put up arbitrarily by the concerted action of the banks . There is no juLtification for high interest rates . There is no real reason for tight money in this country . There is an ample supply of money and credit if the resources of the banks are properly used . " Since my first ' statement about the banks hoarding money I have received letters from business men in all parts of the country showing that commercial credits have been restricted to a very great degree . Some larie manufacturing concerns whose credit is high have told me of the difficulty they are having in selling their commercial paper in the accustomed way . I believe that business will be . beneficially stimulated and prosperity greatly promoted if the banks throughout the country will proceed to use some of their available resources in the purchase of good commercial paper . I am glad to say that there is evidence of a very considerable revival in the commercial paper market within the last few days .
