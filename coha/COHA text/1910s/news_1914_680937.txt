txt While not without Wrecked in precedent , such acUnusual cidents as that which sent the tank Circumstances . steamer Oklahoma to the bottom are extremely rare in sea annals , and , until within years comparatively recent , they never occurred . The only theory offered to explain the loss a this vessel is that stem and stern were simultaneously raised high , each on a big wave , leaving the middle so nearly unsupported that it broke under the strain . Whether or not the after half of the ship separated from the forward part is uncertain , with the chances all against it . However that may be , the stern , weighted by the engines . which in tank steamers are located there , soon went under water , while the bow rose high above it . Such a mishap could happen , of course , only to a vessel long enough to span the distance between two waves , and then only if she were either built or loaded without due regard to this uncommon , but not unknown , emergency . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the break occurred , as was at first reported , is made sure by the fact that the men at that end of the ship were able to launch two boats and get away from the wreck in them . In such a sea , however , they would not have done this except under desperate compulsion , and their departure is therefore evidence both of the speed with which the stern went down and of the instant opening between them and their more fortunate companions in the bow of an abyss that could not be crossed . The notable and significant peculiarity of the disaster is that it took place in the open sea , and not from a collision with anything on or beneath the surface . A modern ship , even though not as large as the Oklahoma , is supposed to be safe in such conditions , no matter how severe the storm  --  so long , at least , as no very great amount of water makes its way into the hold . As a very infrequently violated rule , too , storm waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are too far apart for even the largest ships to be on the crests of two of them at once . There seems to be no reason  --  not even an excuse  --  in this case , for criticism of the Captain 's survival , though a part of his crew was lost . The circumstances of his rescue save him from application of the sea 's cruel but magnificent law . It seems rather hard Explainingh tat ORVILLE WRIGHT New should have made in the London instead of here Stabilizer. the first explanation of his new " stabilizer . " The treatment Which he and his brother have received in this country , while not always and in all respects such as was deserved by their ? achievements , was not bettered abroad , for there , too . they have had to fight infringement of their patents , and even denial of their claim to priority as real navigators of the air . That claim , at ' least , has never been questioned on this side of the water . However , the grievance of foreign publication is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a simultaneous presentation of the facts disclosed regarding-the latest Wright invention ? an invention , by the way , which , ' ehOuld.I t ineet-theiinittir'sr expectations , will earn little less glory than did ' the first practicable aeroplane . It is true that among the professional aviators there is an almost general tendency to minimize the need , and in consequence the importance , of a device for gl'ing automatic stability to their machines , and to trust , as the birds do , to their own skill in meeting any aerial emergency . But the tragic record of aviation only too well proves them wrong  --  that the aviator does not and never can hold the same relation to wings that a bird holds . To change the machine from one of three to one of two dimensions , like every other means of transportation used by human beings , will mark an advance in aerial navigation easily comparable with the ' original step from earth to air . Mr. WalcHT 's present explanation of his " stabilizer " tells plainly enough what can be done with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished . We hear of a pendulum and a little windmill to control the vanes by which lateral and vertical variations of position are met as they begin and readjustment effected without the aid of the aviator . All this will add complexity and weight to the machine . These mean increased liability to get out of order and decreased carrying power , but added safety will be well worth the price , and Mr. Itisnarr can very confidently be credited with knowing what he is about . In making an efOur Customs fort so serious to Not keep Out of the coun-Are try foreigners who All Perfect , have fought duels , our immigration officials show a decidedly amusing inappreciation of the fact that the rightness and wrongness of a thing  --  whether it is morally turpitudMous or not  --  is not a problem in absolutes , but a question largely of chronology and geography . Dueling , as we see it , is a ' practice both absurd and wicked , bringing , if carried to a serious termination , no settlement of anything except the relative skill or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their quarrel . This view of the subject , however , even with us , is a new one , as time is counted in the history of " folkways . " We should not be too censorious , therefore , of the rather numerous millions of people . claiming not wholly without reason to be as civilized as ourselves , who have reached the point of making duels illegal , indeed , and yet go on indulging in them just the same . They insist , and with a certain plans ' - bility. that when and where certain conduct no more liked by us than by them is sure to provoke a challenge to combat nominally mortal , the repressive influ-ence is considerable . No more than that is said in defense of dueling anywhere . nowadays , and though it is n't much , it is something . That we are justified in telling the foreigner not to fight duels here , whatever his opinions of the custom , is beyond denial . For us to say that a man who has fought a duel at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it would be to exclude him because his coat had an unfamiliar cut or his belief in the source and extent of royal power was unlike our own . In short , it is well to be reasonable , and not to be ridiculous , even in being virtuous .
