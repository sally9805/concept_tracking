txt TEACHERS ' EXEMPTION . From One Who Does Not Want Any Favors . To the Editor of The New York-Times : Teachers of New York City desire to enter a protest against exempting from the draft teachers as ? nuch . More than any other class , teachers in the ' public schoole should teach patriotism ; for the only good ground for State schools is to make good citizens . Patriotism ? can hardly be well taught by a slacker or cowardly ? anarchist . Would you have men teachers despised by their pupils ? This great municipality tells its teachers that they shall not volunteer ? that a request for " leave of absence without pay " is equivalent to a reeignation ! And now it is proposed to deprive patriots ? who teach ? of the privilege not only of en/ listing but of being drafted . This is , indeed , to build a men teachers ' force that will not deserve pay equal with that of patriotic women teachers , ready in this world crisis to assume the special tasks of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake of efficiency . Men teachers , more than any other class of men , should succeed in teaching efficiently and quickly the " school of the soldier , of the squad , of the company . " But here is a request for exemption that would prevent them from even learning the " Soldier 's . Bible " ! Further , we protest against an indirect method-of exempting the teacher from combatant service . A request for the recommendation of " teachers of nontechnical subjects with the grade of Second Lieutenants " has been met by submitting a list of ablebodied men teachers within the draft age . This is to put men teachers on a level with such prizefighters and professional ball players as ? those whose " soft Jobe , " it has been claimed , have provoked the resentment of real shipbuilders . May a teacher not be a man ? EDGAR S. SHUMWAY , ( Teacher . ) Brooklyn , Sept. 22 , 1918 . Chaplains Welcome New Order . To the Editor of The New York Times : When I read in your issue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a headline which said " Chaplains Lose Insignia . " I was sorry that you had taken a wrong viewpoint in the matter . I think if you had seen it from the angle of most of the chaplains you would have said " Chaplains Fraed from Military Insignia . " Feeling this way about it myself , I was amazed to read in the next paragraph a news dispatch from Louisville to the effect that of 252 clergymen about to be graduated from the Chaplains ' Training School , 100 were telegraphing their ecclesiastical organizations demanding that protest be made against the new order . I am glad that the hundred are a minority , but I am sorry there are a hundred who feel that way . The new order does not deprive chaplains of the sign which indicates their office ; the cross is not only still worn , it is made more prominent . It is only the sign of his military rank that is taken away , and as a matter of fact that sign Indicates nothing except the amount of pay he draws . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Captain or a Major ? Why should- a chaplain complain at being made more conspicuously a chaplain ? He is actually and obviously a commissioned officer , and that being plain , the only distinguishing mark he needs is the mark of a chaplain  --  the cross . I have been but a short time in tire service , but when I was told that the new order was effective I removed my bars at once and with relief . Now I shall not be addressed any more , I hope , as " Lieutenant , " but as " Chaplain , " which is what I desire . I hope ecclesiastical organizations , local and general , will not merely refrain from protesting against the order , but will rather commend the army authorities for emphasizing the chaplain 's office by exalting the sign of religion and removing the indication of " relative " military rank . CHAS . HENRY WEBB . Camp Hancock , Augusta , Ga ... Sept. 27 , 1918 . The First of His Comnanv . To the Editor of The New York Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people read in your paper the short notices of the boys " over there , " giving their units and other data , who have been killed or wounded , especially before the Government has reported them . My son , George Alden Swinnerton of Buffalo , belonged to Company D , 306th Machine Gun Battalion , ' 17th Division , the Camp Upton Division . He is the first one of his company to be killed  --  Aug. 15 , 1918 . The Government has not yet reported it . As many of this company belonged in ' New York City and vicinity , I thought it would be of some interest to parents and relatives of boys in that company to get this . information . I am inclosing a copy of a very kind and beautiful letter from the Captain of the company  --  Captain W. E. Gillam ? in retard to my son 's death . ' F. G. SWIN/kTERTON , Rutland , Vt. , Sept. 117. 1918 . ( Inclosure . Headquarters Company D. ** M. G. En. , American E. F. , August 23 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street , Rutland , Vt . Dear Sir : It is not my wish to offer condolences  --  mawkish sentiment seems out of place  --  but I do want you to know that the loss of your son was a blow dealt individually to each and every one of us . By his never-failing good humor and willingness to bear not only his own burdens but to give a helping hand with the burdens of others , your son had endeared himself in the hearts of every man in the company . One ca n't reason why he should have been taken first . He was . And high on the northern slope of a mountain overlooking the River Vesle the battalion chaplain , unmindful of enemy shelling , rendered ' the burial service , and there the grave will forever give mute testimony of what American manhood stands for in this war for righteousness . E. GILLAai , Captain Co . D. The Italian Relief Fund Appeal . To the Editor of The New York Times : I have just noticed for the first time an inadvertent error of statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIMES concerning the Italian War Relief Fund which I beg the privilege of correcting , as it does injustice to the Royal Italian Ambassador , Count V. Macchi di Cellere . It is stated that the nationalization of the Boston Committee 's work , of which ours has become a part , was undertaken " with the approval " and " at the solicitation " el the Ambassador . The first phrase is entirely correct , but the latter is not , and I did not mean to be so understood . In this matter . his Excellency , while cordially responding to the initiative of the Boston Committee , acted with his well-known dignity and discretion .
