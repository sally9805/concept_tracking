Hines , who was 21 years old , was a senior at Yale when he entered the first omcers ' training camp at Fort Sheridan . He was assigned to a machine gun unit and left the United States the latter part of December . Life in the trenches proved too rigorous for him and rheumatism developed early in April . He refused to leave his command and continued to perform his duties until one day he became so weak he had to be carried to his quarters . He was removed later to the base hospital when symptoms of pneumonia developed .
