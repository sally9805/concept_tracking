txt Committee Says That Conflicts Between Departments Have Been costly . The Committee on Congestion of Population declared in a statement issued yesterday that the lack of a far-sighted " city plan " is proving costly to New York . Much city money is wasted , says the . committee , because of the conflicting plans of different city departments regarding the same land sites . In 1905 , for example , the city prepared elaborate maps and plans , which involved the discontinuance of various streets in Elmhurst . Then it was discovered that the city had already bought a costly school site on one of the streets which were to be discontinued , and the elaborate city map of the section had to be made again . The new Coney Island Hospital is going to bring about the same kind of costly confusion , says the statement , ' by interfering with the extension of East Fourth and Fifth Streets , Brooklyn . The city 's elaborate plans regarding Barnes Avenue , in the Bronx . would have to be greatly changed because of a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the street lines . The same mishap had befallen the city 's plans regarding Bailey Avenue , in the Bronx . As a result the city 's map of ' ' the section had to be changed and the opening proceedings amended . The city started proceedings to take title to part of East Twenty-third Street , Brooklyn , two years ago , the statement continues . Immediately afterward a number of buildings were constructed in the way . To avoid buying the buildings the city had to give up its plans and amend the opening proceedings . The Building Department and the Department of Public Works in Queens recently got into a costly tangle because each wanted to do a different thing in the same place , the report states . The Public Works Department some time ago started proceedings to acquire title to part of Fresh Pond Road . Shortly after the Building Department issued permits for the erection of buildings on the road . To prevent the erection of these buildings the Public Works Department had to buy parts of the street it did not need . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has recently cost it over $1,000. - 000 , the committee says , In connection with Bellevue Hospital alone . The city bought most of the Bellevue site ninetynine years ago at less than $4,000 per acre . The hospital paid $244,000 four years ago for a small additional plot . Still more recently the hospital had to pay almost $1,500,000 for about one acre of land between Twenty-eighth and Twenty-ninth Streets . One piece of ground the hospital needed cost the city almost $500,000 , and involved the tearing down of an expensive factory . MAKE THE MAN FIT THE JOB . President Maclaurin 's Plea to the Alumni of " Tech . " The annual dinner of the Technology Club of New York was held on Saturday evening at the Hotel Knickerbocker . This club is made up of the alumni of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , there being over a thousand alumni in New York and its immediate neighbor ' hood . The principal speaker was President Maclaurin , who went to Boston in June last , from Columbia University . " All serious men recognize that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said President Maclaurin . " One of these is due to the current notion , founded on a false theory of democracY , that one man is as good as another , and therefore , that it does n't matter very much who gets a job with the proviso . perhaps , that he be reasonably honest . Of course this is a monstrous doctrine and is not much improved in its more cynical form that any man can fill the post that he is clever enough to get . More might have been said for that in the good old simple days . But to-day the world is far too complex and we must demand not only intelligence but trained intelligence . " He should remember , too , that most of the complexity of modern life is due to the social and industrial revolution brought about by the applications of science . and that the business man who is not imbued with the scientific spirit is an anachronism . He was born in the seventeenth century ana has not yet outlived it . He and real experts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered too long from blundering amateurs arid must pull them out root and branch . Then we most keep in view the dangers that arise from the spirit or extravagance that is so much abroad . It may easily drive us on to the rocks . Most carefully must we keep a lookout for means of avoiding waste . I have little doubt that half the wealth of me next generation will come from new applications of science that will show us how to avoid waste in our industrial operations . " But even without any new applicaItion of science there is much that might easily be avoided now , if only men were I properly trained , I heard recently of a single instance . A " Tech " man was employed some time ago to administer a department in a great city . In a short time by the adoption of scientific methods he had given the city a better service and I lessened the cost by a million dollars a year . Let us imagine that such a man is allowed by the politicians to continue this work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus saved by even a small fraction of the ten thousand men who are trained at the Boston Tech in a generation , and you may form some estimate in dollars and cents of the value to the community of such an institution .
