txt Terror prevails to-night throughout the FrenchCanadian colony in Valley Street as the result of the murder of four strikebreaking operatives , who had returned to work in spite of threats made by members of the Italian colony in adjacent streets . In all the foreign quarter there is intense excitement over the crime , and only the presence and activity of the militia have prevented serious disorder and possibly interracial conflicts . The four victims are : Dir. and Mrs. JOSEPH SARVARIA . I Miss ANNA TANGUAY . FELIX GONN . Just before 9 o'clock to-night a fellow . countrywoman visited a three-story ramshackle tenement between Hampshire and Franklin Streets , in which a dozen families of French Canadian operatives are housed . While passing the landing on the second floor , she discovered blood corning from beneath the door of a threemom tenement occupied by the Sarvarias who two days ago returned to work in the mills . Shrieking in fright , she rushed from the house and told a group of tenants , gathered on the sidewalk . One of the men went up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen he discovered the bodies of two men and a woman with their faces slashed almost beyond reeog-nition .. In.an adjoining bedroom was found the body of the second woman , who had also been mutilated in most fiendish fashion , In an incredibly short time the crime became known to other inmates of the house , who flocked into the streets , hyste ical with terror . ews of the murders spread tepidly un the entire district was aroused and a mo of several thousand persons filled the street from curb to curb . The women were half crazy with fright , while the men made loud threats of retaliation , against the Italian strikers , W110 were thought to have committed ' the crime . One Canadian forced his way to the front of the excited mob and in stentorian tones ueged his fellow-countrymen ' to take reprisal upon the /Weans in the adjoining section of the mill district . Militia Promptly On Rand . Before the mob could act on this advice two companies of infantry swept into the street at either end , and with leveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then into the neighboring tenements , whence they had emerged . In less than ten minutes after the murders were discovered , the streets had been cleared as if by magic , and members of the State and local Police Departments had entered the house and begun an investigation to discover the identity of the victims . The murders are a direct result of the inter-racial jealousies in the ranks of the strikers . Since the arrest of Joseph J. Ettor , their leader , Wednesday morning , the strikers have been divided into opposing camps , according to the nationalities represented . The Syrian , Armenian , Polish , Russian , Italian , and Lithuanian strikers have re . mained steadfast , and for the most part have refused to return to work , The Franco-Belgian , French-Canadian , and English-speaking people , who are the better paid classes among the operatives , have deserted in large numbers , and this fact has aroused considerable racial hatred .. The tenement in which the murders were committed lies in the most congested part of the city . It is ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' of four and five story tenements , and is accessible only by a dark , narrow passageway between two adjoining buildings . How the murderers could have done such a deed without being discovered or without the cries of their victims being heard is a mystery to the police . It is believed that the four victims were slain early this morning . The police base this theory on the fact that the body of the woman , found in the bedroom , wag only partly clothed , although the other victims were fully dressed . It is thought that the latter were seated about the stove in the kitchen with their backs toward the door . and were struck : down from the rear without warning . Three Men Seen Running Away . From neighbors living on the opposite side of Valley Street , facing the alley which led to the house in which the murders were committed , the police learned late to-night that just before 5 o'clock this morning three and evidently excited men were seen to run out of the passageway . Owing to the dim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trio . The four victims resumed work in the lower Pacific Mill Wednesday , and last night they celebrated the event , Neighbors on the ground floor heard sounds of revelry , which ceased at 3 o'clock this morning . It is believed by the police that the victims were attacked just before ' daybreak , while in a drunken stupor . This , the police hold , explains wily the murderers were not detected in the commission of the deed . Dr. George W. Dow , Medical Examiner , viewed the bodies , and stated that all four had been dead for at least twelve hours before the bodies were discovered . " Scab " Chalked on Door . Peter Sarvaria , uncle of Joseph Sarvaria , informed the police that the morning after his four fellow countrymen resumed work the door of the squalid tenement in which they dwelt was heavily chalked with the word " Scab . " From other residents of the French-Canadian colony ft was learned that the same thin d has occurred to other striking operativeN ty who have restenieaWorle The French-Canadians are in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by members of the Strike Committee of their own nationality , who report to the General Committee the identity of those who have been forced by necessity - to resume ' work . As the result of the quadruple tragedy of to-night , it is believed that many of those who have already returned to the mills will refuse to do so to-morrow morning . in the opinion of prominent attorneys cf this city there is little doubt that the habeas corpus proceedings begun at Bos. tpn ? by the strikers for the release under bail of their leader , Joseph J. Ettor , tomorrow , will be successful . They declare there is no prima facie case upon which to hold the labor leader , and , in addition , it is asserted that there is no precedent for the arrest of an alleged accessory where the perpetrators of the crime itself are unknown . Should Ettor be released from prison tomorrow , the situation will assume ' a grave and dangerous aspect . It is known that unless the mills have a complement of at least .30 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximately $.35,000,000 worth of time contracts , now to be filled by the twelve mills affected , will have to be- sent to histories in other cities . Should this be done , the strike leaders declare . a general strike will be called throughout New Eng:and to force the mill owners to yield .. RAIN OF MONEY FOR STRIKERS . Anarchists and Socialists Raise Fund at Carnegie Hall Meeting . Carnegie Hall presented a remarkable spectacle shortly before 31 o'clock last night when , in the midst of a debate between Emma Goldman , the Anarchist , and Sol Fieldman , the Socialist debater , William D. Haywood , the Western labor leader , who was on ... , of the four men tried for the assassination of Gov . Steunenberg of Idaho and is now one of the strike leaders in the textile strike at Lawrence , Mass. , srose and made a plea for money for the support of the textile strikers . The result was a rain of money . From the boxes and the galleries bills and silver were thrown upon the stage , girls ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fieldman stopped debating and began to help pick up the money , while Haywood. shouting with all the great power of his lungs , urged the people to " Keep the good work up . " Haywood said that when the Lawrence strike was won , a strike of all the textile workers in the United States would probably be ordered . " I do n't want a man or woman in this audience , " Haywood shouted , " to go out of this place with more than carfare in his or her pocket . " Previous to this plea Haywood had made a long speech on the Lawrence strike , and as a result of a passing of hats through the audience immediately ' after that speech $452.04 had been raised . He had only asked for alek , and when he saw that his request had yielded so much more than he asked , he decided the time was ripe for a second appeal , and the shower of coins from the boxes and the galleries was the result . Haywood was the Chairman of the meeting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goldman ants Fieldman . The audience that paid to get in was as great in number and just as enthusiastic as was the greeting that was extended to Senator La Follette when he exhorted In the same place recently . It was a remarkable audience . Every nationality , ' it seemed , was represented . There were men and women , gay and old . and at least a third of all those present were young men and women . Of the latter hundreds appeared to be girls still in their teens . In the boxes were scores of finely dressed women , and these were every whit as enthusiastic as were the poorer people in the top galleries in their applause of the anarchistic utterances of Emma Goldman , who argued that direct and not political action was needed to solve the problems of the working classes of ' America . Fieldrnan had the political action end of the argument . Haywood came from Lawrence to preside at the meeting . The big , one-eyed leader was not down for a speech , but he was there to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over he had made two or three . His first was a denunciation of Goy. boss , and a direct charge that men in the employ of the owners of the textile mills of Lawrence had planted dynamite about the city to have an excuse to ask for the militia . Haywood said the average wage of the Lawrence strikers was ee a week , and that out of this the mill owners had deducted an average of 22 cents a week from each worker . The result was the strike . " While the strikers were walking peacefully out of the factories , " said ; Haywood , " the mill owners turned the these on them . and the water that was t. thrown dpon those men and women and little children was hot . They could not get an excuse for the militia that was a ? legal or a just one , and so the mill owners decided to make an excuse . And how did they do it ? Thee sent minions in ' their employ about the city , and these . men , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the City of Lawrence . " The dynamite was , of course , discovered and then they had their excuse arid demanded that the militia be sent to Law- , renec . The Governor of Massachusetts is Foss , and Foss , being a mull owner . himself and a politician with aspirations , did as they asked and sent the uniformed butchers to Lawrence to baptize tiieir ! bayonets in human blood . A Syrian was stabbed in the back by a drunken soldier and he died , and then a sharpshooter shot and Milled a defenseless woman . They are there to do murder . " The soldiers have failed to break the strike , end now they have tried another : trick and pot Ettor , the brave leader of I the strike , in jail . When they impris-i oned Feinr they sent to jail a dangerous man . dangerous . 7 mean , to the mill owners , and a man who is to-day more valuable to the working classes than is any I labor man that I know of . " Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . are fightaae elne for their right to live They are the persons3yho clothe yea , eiel yet they are the persons who are naked . I want to say that if the Lawrence strike is won . and i believe it will he . that an effort will be made to extend it to all the textile industries in the . United States , ' Then it was that Haywood had the hats passed around . and - the contribution of eelle td : W ? 15 the result . After this first collection Emma Goldman and Freidman had their chance . Emma Goldman opened the debate . She shouted that " the working class must use the strongest weapons at their command , " whereupon the audience shouted out its apnroval . She did not name the weapons . Direct action . " she said , was a weapon that " will strike the most vital spot of the capitalistic class . " and when the cheering ceased she said the vital spot she had in mind was nronertY . " Direct action . " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she said that two other men who had stood for direct action were the brothers . Tire affair . she said , proved that a class war was on in this country . Fieldman was just as extreme , but he was for political and rot direct action . He denounced the s and referred to the assassinations of the Emnress Elizabeth of Austria and of Pres- ! dent . " They- sent a man over the ocean to kill a sweet old woman simply because she was the wife " of a king , " said Fieldman , " and another . while shaking the friendly outstretched hand of a man . shat and killed that man because he was a President of the United States . If that is direct action , why , then I say , with all my soul . damn direct action . " A mass meeting of sympathizers with the strikers at Lawrence will be held this afternoon at 4 o'clock in Union Square , near Seventeenth Street . William Haywood will he one of the speakers and Emma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstration was planned last night at a meeting of sixteen organizations in sympathy with the strikers .
