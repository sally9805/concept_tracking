 | I Connections A NATURAL pause appears to have come in the career of Mr. H. G. Wells . For twenty years he has been dashing up and down through time and space , glancing back and forth between the Stone Age and the end of the world , darting about among the planets . Occasionally we have seen him as a thin streak overhead connecting the two horizons ; we have heard his voice , insistent and shrill , floating back to us now from this quarter , now from that . But surely no moving-picture machine was ever agile enough to catch and record him . Six or seven years ago anyone versed in natural phenomena might safely have predicted the return of Mr. Wells to his own planet . That streak in the sky became more frequent ; that shrill voice which came to us among the intermittent air-currents began to develop a richer and more plangent tone . It fell out of the sky more and more as an authentic vox humana . One began to feel a certain presence in the atmosphere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own solar system . And then he emerged . With a strong glass one might have seen him circling down through the interstellar emptiness , circling easily and swiftly , swimming at last under the clouds , touching earth , alighting ! Nothing more extraordinary has happened in our time . Mr. Wells began life as a kind of salamandrine biped ; he has become an authentic and very unusual child of Adam . And all manner of interesting things are implied in this . One of them is the collapse of Modernity . In a recent essay Mr. Wells has told us not to expect any more dramatic novelties ; for the present at any rate our business must be to make science and socialism feel at home . I derive an unspeakable comfort from this assertion . How many of us , I wonder , have been suffering from an acute incurable headache during the last  | ten years or so , trying to keep up with the Modern Mind ? We have had a fresh dramatic novelty every three quarters of an hour . The Modern Mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been taught strange words and strange virtues . We have been abjectly at the mercy of Advanced Persons , Eaters of Nuts , and Worshippers of Supermen . I for one have more than once taken refuge and buried my head for safety in the Middle Ages . And now it is all over . I am not surprised . Occasionally I have taken a furtive glance at our singular world ; ? unmistakably there has been a promise of clearing and fine weather . But sooner or later I was certain to hear Eugenics rumbling on the horizon , and I ducked back again . Now that I have at last emerged I should like to make two slight recommendations of a literary kind . Why should not some promising young writer immortalize himself with a book called " Modernity : What It Was and How It Happened " ? The other suggestion is not so drastic ; it is intended for one of my countrymen , a young man of quieter tastes , who is anxious to write a doctor 's thesis in English literature : " H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thought from The War in the Air to The Elegy in a Country Churchyard . " After all , he would only have to write a paragraph or so about Wells ; and I feel sure that if he made only that much of a concession to the world we live in he might obtain some minor post in a Western university . Anyway it is worth considering . In fact I propose to do something of the sort in these immediate pages ; and I wish the reader to understand that in the sentence he is now reading I am passing from the gay to the grave . First of all I should like to get a certain historical perspective . Let us assume that the epoch of the Modern Mind extended from 1890 to 1914 , and that one can think of it as finished . During this period one singular outstanding assumption prevailed , if one is to trust a good authority like Mr. Edwin Bjorkman . This assumption was that certain thinkers and writers in the world 's history " belong " to us of the twentieth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept , for  | example , those who at any time rebelled against law , those who had theories about diet , those who " saw things as they are , " and the like ; just as we were to reject those who found that there were tears in things , those who looked forward to a better world somewhere else , those who believed in original sin or duty or honor or sentiment , those who lost their tempers or were a little befuddled in their minds , and the like . Everyone knows how arbitrarily the line was drawn . In French literature , for example , it was extended back far enough to include Stendhal and to leave Chateaubriand in outer darkness , ? Stendhal was " modern , " Chateaubriand was " not modern . " In German it included Schopenhauer and Max Stirner , and for all practical purposes ? confess it , my friends ? left out Goethe . But why should I go on in this way ? Mr. Bjorkman is busily compiling his calendar of the true saints , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has collapsed . For the last twenty years the thought of the world has been dominated to a quite extraordinary degree by men who have been educated solely through the movements in which they have taken part . Never before was there so universal and so hectic an empiricism . Time has avenged itself on Huxley for saying that science is as much a liberal education as literature . The man of molecules , the man of diet , the man of his own passions , the riotous antinomian has prevailed , and a pretty hash we have made of our world . Who regrets it ? That is the way the earth moves . Like an inchworm it doubles itself up at intervals and then gradually stretches itself straight again . The whole nineteenth century , according to Taine , was occupied in working out two or three ideas concocted in Germany during the Napoleonic era . History is a succession of Gothic invasions and academic subversions . And now our own Visigoths have capitulated . Bernard Shaw has read Plato , H. G. Wells talks about the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession of the field , and the test of contemporary ideas has become not how much they can provoke and frighten it , but what they can do with it . Grant science , grant socialism ? very well ! here is the stuff you have to work upon . Can you change it , enrich it ,  | liberate it , can you love it , teach it , help it ? I do n't see how anyone can doubt the issue . Who at least does not prefer the indigestion of 1914 to the starvation of 1870 ? But now that the outposts have been taken and the pioneers have unloaded and found water , a busy , happy and fruitful traffic begins . Where are the implements , the history , the literature ? all those books , for example , which were too bulky and irrelevant for the advance party ? Religious emotion must come to fulfil these new religious ideas , ? forgotten instincts of the soil and of the heart . In short , connections have to be made , relationships have to be established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationships are bound to appear . Suppose , for example , one were to attempt to get a phenomenon like H. G. Wells free of the hectic medium of purely contemporary influences , to see him released for a moment from the designs and generalities of science and socialism , to relate him in some way with the traditional stream of English thinking and writing . I want to avoid being needlessly grotesque and violent , I am prepared in due time to make all the necessary apologies ; but I simply must say that there is a connection , a most surprising , disconcerting , topsy-turvy connection between H. G. Wells and Matthew Arnold . Matthew Arnold ! I can see that superb middle-class gentleman with his great face and deprecating hands , I can see his look of horror . This engineer , this uncircumcised fragment of the populace , this aerial chauffeur ! But stop and think . Wells on Criticism , Wells on Education , Wells on Politics and the nostrums of Liberalism , Wells even on Religion speaks with the voice of Arnold . Everywhere there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the same faith in ideas and standards , the same dislike of heated bungling , plunging , wilfulness , and confusion ; even , one might add , the same preponderant aversion and contempt for most things that are , the same careful vagueness of ideal . Who invented that phrase about " seeing things as in themselves they really are " ? Who spent his life in trying to make England believe in ideas and act upon ideas instead of " muddling through " ? Who never wearied of holding up the superiority of everything French and  | everything German to everything English ? Read Arnold 's chapter on Our Liberal Practitioners and you will find the precise attitude of Wells toward the premature inadequate doing of things rather than the continued research , experiment and discipline that lead to right fulfilments . Who urged the ventilation of life , affairs , conduct in the light of world experience ? Who preached the gospel of reasonableness and more light ? Who spurred England to cultivate the virtue of intellectual curiosity ? Who believed almost passionately in coolness and detachment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to his generation Wells remarkably has been to ours . Differing in their view of the substance of religion , their conception of the Church as a great common receptacle for the growing experience of the race is precisely the same . Who believed that in these matters fragmentation , segregation , sectarianism are the worst of evils ? Ventilation , curiosity , centrality , detachment of mind , mutuality , ? these are quite fundamental traits , and Matthew Arnold and H. G. Wells share them in a singular degree . I am quite aware of the difference in personal quality . They are at once alike and totally different , just as a pretty face and an ugly face often are , the features being identical , the expression worlds apart And the expression is the thing that matters . It is merely an advantage to see a socialist in the light of a man who never heard of socialism , to see that socialism is just a natural outgrowth of those " best things that have been thought and said in the world . " Given so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply shows how fundamental the personal quality is , and that to approach a man through his ideas is like approaching a flower through its botanical parts . Yet I doubt if there has been a novelist whose personal quality has had a more definite philosophical string to it . Indisputably it is the world that matters with Wells , not the individual who blunders so tragically through it ? the world , the race , the future . Otherwise I should never so temerariously attempt to criticise him . All criticism is profane ? one comes to that . It is blatantly , awkwardly , impertinently outside . There are things in any real novel , any real poem that simply put an end to prattling.  | II The First Phase I AM , by a sort of predestination , a socialist , " Wells wrote once . And everything one can say of him serves merely to explain , justify , qualify , illuminate and refine that statement . First of all it implies a certain disposition and certain habits of mind , habits of mind which are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in those marvellous tales of Time and Space that won him his original sensational fame . It is this disposition behind them , this quality they have as of an inevitable attitude toward life and the world , which distinguishes them at once from those other superficially similar tales of Jules Verne . The marvels of Jules Verne are just marvels , delightful , irresponsible plunderings from a helpless universe . To the grown-up mind they have a little of that pathetic futility one associates with a millionaire 's picture-gallery , where all sorts of things have been brought together , without any exercise of inevitable personal choice , because they are expensive . I do n't know that the tales of Wells are better tales , but they have that ulterior synthetic quality that belongs to all real expressions of personality . Wells was never merely inventive ; his invention was the first stage of an imaginative growth . Now the quality that pervades all these early writings is what may be called a sense of the infinite plasticity of things . He conceived a machine that could travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become invisible , a drug that made men float like balloons , another drug that enabled men to live a thousand hours in one , a crystal egg through which one could watch the life in Mars , a man who could stop the sun like Joshua , a food that turned men into giants , a biologist who discovered a method of carving animals into men , an angel who visited a rural vicar , a mermaid who came to earth in search of a soul , a homicidal orchid , a gigantic bird hatched from a prehistoric egg , a man who passed outside space . In short , the universe  | appeared to him like that magic shop of which he also wrote , where the most astonishing things may happen , if you are the Right Sort of Boy . If all this implies anything it implies that things in general are not fixed and static , but that they are , on the contrary , infinitely plastic , malleable , capable of responding to any purpose , any design you may set working among them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quite possibly is proceeding after some logical method of its own , but so far as man is concerned this method appears to be one of chance . Obviously , man can do the most surprising things in it , can take as it were all sorts of liberties with it . The universe , in short , is like a vacant field which may or may not belong to some absent landlord who has designs of his own upon it ; but until this absent landlord appears and claims his field , all the children in the neighborhood can build huts in it and play games upon it and , in a word , for all practical purposes , consider it their own . This idea of the relation between free will and determinism is the underlying assumption of ' ells , as he explains it in First and Last Things : " Take life at the level of common sensations and common experience and there is no more indisputable fact than man 's freedom of will , unless it is his complete moral responsibility . But make only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of inevitable consequences , a rigid succession of cause and effect . " And elsewhere he says : " On the scientific plane one is a fatalist . . . . But does the whole universe of fact , the external world about me , the internal world from which my motives rise , form one rigid and fated system as the Determinists teach ? I incline to that belief . . . . For me as a person this theory of predestination has no practical value .... I hesitate just as though the theory was unknowable . For me and my conduct there is that much wide practical margin of freedom . I am free and freely and responsibly making the future ? so far as I am concerned . " In a word , for all the purposes that affect man 's need the universe is infinitely plastic and amenable to his will . Like every clean-cut philosophical conception this clears the ground for practical conduct and a certain sort of direct action . @#  | There was a time , no doubt , when he shared the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human will . When the universe appears as unconventional as it used to appear to Wells , there can surely be no reason to think it ? impossible , after a comet has collided with the world , for the human race to become suddenly Utopian . Generally speaking , comets do not collide with the world , and in the same way men are slow to change . But certainly if Wells ever thought of humanity as merely a multiplication of one pattern , certainly if he has long since abandoned the idea of our all turning over a new leaf one fine morning , he has never lost his faith in free will as regards the individual . He has always believed in the personal doctrine of summarily " making an end to things " as distinguished from the old-fashioned doctrine of " making the best of things " ; and there is nothing more modern about him than his aversion to the good old English theory of " muddling through . " Mr. Polly is a good example of his view of personal direct action , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has only sentiment to save it from complete demoralization . " When a man has once broken through the wall of every-day circumstances , " he remarks at the moment of the Polly debacle , " he has made a discovery . If the world does not please you , you can change it . Determine to alter it at any price , and you can change it altogether . " Mr. Polly sets fire to his shop , takes to the road and repairs his digestion . Desertion of duty and the quick repudiation of entanglements make him healthy and sensible and give him a sense of purpose in things . And I know of nothing in all Wells that is described with more relish than that Beltane festival which occurs toward the end of In the Days of the Comet . The world 's great age has begun anew , and the enlightened men of the new time revive the May Day of old in order to burn the useless trappings of the past . They heap old carpets on the fire , ill-designed furniture , bad music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog-eared penny fiction , sham shoes , and all the corrugated iron in the world ; every tangible thing that is useless , false , disorderly , accidental , obsolete , and tawdry to celebrate the beginning of things  | that are clean , beautiful , and worthy . Sceptical , hesitant , and personal as Wells has become , that indicates a strong primitive mental trait . What a world he must have grown up in , one says to oneself ! But philosophy does not spring out of the brain ; we hate the hateful things of our own experience , just as we think the things we desire . And though there are nine and sixty ways of being a socialist , they all unite in a certain sense of the plasticity and malleability of things human , a certain faith in the possibility of asserting order in the midst of disorder and intelligently cleaning house . Inherent in this trait is another ? detachment . You only become aware of confusion when you stand free of it , when you cease to be a part of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life I doubt if there has been one so detached as Wells . The mental detachment of his early tales is a detachment half scientific , half artistic ; scientific as of one who sees things experimentally in their material , molecular aspect , artistic as of one conscious of moulding will and placed amid plastic material . Thus , for example , he sees human beings quite stripped of their distinctively human qualities ; he sees men anatomically , as in that passage where the Invisible Man , killed with a spade , becomes visible again as a corpse : " Everyone saw , faint and transparent as though it were made of glass , so that veins and arteries and bones and nerves could be distinguished , the outline of a hand , a hand limp and prone . It grew clouded and opaque even as they stared .... And so , slowly beginning at his hands and feet and creeping along his limbs to the vital centres of his body , that strange change continued . First came the little white nerves , a hazy grey stretch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then the flesh and skin , first a faint fogginess , then growing rapidly dense and opaque . " Similar is a passage in ii Story of the Days to Come , where he describes an ordinary breakfast of our own day : " the rude masses of bread needing to be carved and smeared over with animal fat before they could be made palatable , the still recognisable fragments of recently killed animals , hideously charred and hacked . " That surely is quite as a man from another planet , or a chemist after a long day 's work in the laboratory , would view our familiar  | human things . And one recalls another sentence from Kipps where this detachment links itself with a deeper social insight and hints at the part it had come to play in Wells 's later mind : " I see through the darkness , " he says , toward the end of the book , " the souls of my Kippses as they are , as little pink strips of quivering , living stuff , as things like the bodies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel pain , who are naughty and muddled and suffer , and do not understand why . And just as he sees men and human things chemically and anatomically , so he sees the world astronomically . He has that double quality ( like his own Mr. Bessel ) of being bodily very active in life and at the same time watching it from a great distance . In his latest book he has figured a god looking on from the clouds ; and there is nothing in his novels more stimulating and more uncanny than his faculty of telescoping his view suddenly from the very little to the very large , expanding and contracting his vision of things at will . You find the germ of this faculty in his early tales . Looking down as though from a balloon he sees the world as a planet , as a relatively small planet , In doing so he maintains at first a purely scientific set of values ; he is not led , as he has since been led , and as Leopardi was led by the same imaginative experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ littleness and the powerlessness of man . His values remain scientific , and the absurdity he feels is the absurdity an astronomer must feel , that in so small a space men can vaunt themselves and squabble with one another . Race prejudice , for example , necessarily appears to him as foolish as it would appear to ordinary eyes among insects that happen to be swarming on a fallen apple . Once you get it into your mind that the world is a ball in space , you find a peculiar silliness in misunderstandings on that ball . This reflection has led to many views of life ; in Wells it led to a sense of the need of human solidarity . And solidarity implies order . The sense of order is one of those instincts exhibited everywhere in the writings of Wells that serve as preliminaries to his social philosophy . There is a passage in Kipps where he pictures the satisfactions of shop- keeping to an elect soul : " There is , of course , nothing on earth , " he says , " and I doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like starting a small haberdasher 's shop . Imagine , for example , having a drawerful of tapes , or again , an array of neat , large packages , each displaying one sample of hooks and eyes . Think of your cottons , your drawer of coloured silks , etc . " De Foe knew a similar satisfaction and has pictured it in Robinson Crusoe . De Foe was himself a shopkeeper , just as Wells has been in one of his incarnations ; and he knew that good shopkeeping is the microcosm of all good political economy . The satisfaction of a thoroughly competent man who is thrown on a desert island , and sets to work to establish upon it a political economy for one , is a satisfaction by itself . That certainly is a primitive relish , and it is one of the first gestures of Wells 's sociology . Now the sense of solidarity , the sense of order , implies the subordination of details , the discipline of constituent units . Only in his later works did Wells begin to consider the problems of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them almost exclusively , but always in relation to the constructive purpose of society and as what may be called human reservations from it . The telescope has been adjusted to a close range , and the wider relationships are neither so emphasized nor so easily discerned . Nevertheless it is still the world that matters to Wells ? the world , the race , the future ; not the individual human being . And if , relatively , he has become more interested in the individual and less in the world , that is because he is convinced that the problems of the world can best be approached through the study of individuals . His philosophy has grown less abstract in harmony with his own experience ; but the first sketch of his view of human nature and its function is to be found crudely outlined in the scientific romances . How does it figure there ? The human beings who flit through these early tales are all inconspicuous little men , whose private existence is of no account , and who exist to discover , invent , perform all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summary and quite unimportant destruction . They are merely , in the most complete sense , experiments in the collective purpose , and their  | creator has toward them just the attitude of an anatomist toward the animals upon which he is experimenting ; not indifferent to their suffering as suffering , but ignoring it in the spirit of scientific detachment necessary to subordinate means to an end . " I wanted ? it was the only thing I wanted ? to find out the limit of plasticity in a living form , " says Dr. Moreau in his confession ; " and the study has made me as remorseless as nature . " Invariably these experiments in human possibility , placed in a world where charity is not so strong as fear , die quite horribly . Dr. Moreau is destroyed by the beasts he is attempting to vivisect into the semblance of men , the Invisible Man is battered to death with a spade , the Visiting Angel burns to death in attempting to carry out his celestial errand , the man who travels to the moon can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden of the later novels , that the individual who plans and wills for the race is destroyed and broken by the jealousy , prejudice and inertia in men and the blind immemorial forces of nature surging through himself ? These are the forces that are figured , in the early tales , by that horrible hostile universe of nature , and the little intrepid men moving about in the midst of it . And the mind of Wells is always prepared for the consequences of what it engenders . The inevitable result of creating an imaginary world of malignant vegetables and worse than antediluvian monsters is that the imaginary men you also create shall suffer through them . You reverse the order of evolution and return men to conditions where life is cheap . An imagination which has accustomed itself to running loose among planets and falling stars , which has lived habitually in a universe where worlds battle with one another , is prepared to stomach a little needless bloodshed . The inflexible pursuit of an end implies the sacrifice of means , and if your experiment happens to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it kills the man . Widen the range and this proposition logically transmutes itself into a second : if your experiment happens to be an orderly society you will produce order at the expense of everything that represents disorder . And from the point of view of a collective purpose , ends , motives and affections that are private and  | have no collective significance represent disorder . Now the whole purpose of Wells 's later work has been to illuminate and refine this proposition . He has flatly distinguished between two sorts of human nature , the constructive , experimental sort which lives essentially for the race , and the acquiescent , ineffectual sort which lives essentially for itself or the established fact ; and he gives to his experimental men and women an almost unlimited charter to make ducks and drakes of the ineffectual . Think of the long list of dead and wounded in his novels ? Mr. Pope , Mr. Stanley , Mr. Magnet , Mr. Manning , Margaret , Marion ? and you realize how much of a certain cruelty , a certain ruthlessness is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . Another primitive relish exhibited in these early tales is the delight of constructing things . The Time Machine , for example , is the work of a mind that immoderately enjoys inventing , erecting , and putting things together ; and there is not much difference between constructing an imaginary machine and constructing an imaginary society . If Wells 's early Utopian speculations are ingenious impossibilities , are they any more or less so than his mechanical speculations ? One does n't begin life with an overwhelming recognition of the obstacles one may encounter ? one does n't fret too much about the possible , the feasible , or even the logical . It was enough for Wells that he had built his Time Machine , though the logic by which the Time Traveller explains his process is a logic that gives me , at least , a sense of helpless , blinking discomfort ? partly , I confess , because to this day I do n't believe there is anything the matter with it . In any case it , is the sheer delight of construction that fascinates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He is in love with steel ; he speaks with a kind of ecstasy somewhere of " light and clean and shimmering shapes of silvered steel " ; steel and iron have for him the transcendental charm that harebells and primroses had for Wordsworth . A world like that in When the Sleeper Wakes ? a world of gigantic machines , air fleets , and the " swimming shadows and enormous shapes " of an engineer 's nightmare ? is only by afterthought , one feels , the speculation of a sociolo-@#  | gist . It expresses the primitive relish of a constructive instinct . It expresses also a sheer curiosity about the future . In a chapter of his book on America Wells has traced the development of what he calls his prophetic habit of mind as a passage through four stages : the millennial stage of an evangelical childhood when an imminent Battle of Armageddon was a natural thing to be looked for ; the stage of ultimate biological possibilities ; the stage of prediction by the rule-of-three ; and a final stage of cautious anticipation based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the region of religious or scientific possibilities to the region of human possibilities . " There is no Being but Becoming " was the first of his mental discoveries ; and finding years later that Heraclitus had said the same thing he came to regard the pre-Aristotelian metaphysics as the right point of departure for modern thought . " I am curiously not interested in things , " he wrote , " and curiously interested in the consequences of things . . . . I have come to be , I am afraid , even a little insensitive to fine immediate things through this anticipatory habit .... This habit of mind confronts and perplexes my sense of things that simply are , with my brooding preoccupation with how they will shape presently , what they will lead to , what seed they will sow and how they will wear . At times , I can assure the reader , this quality approaches other-worldliness in its constant reference to an all-important hereafter . There are times indeed when it makes life seem so transparent and flimsy , seem so dissolving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the enhanced sense of instability becomes restlessness and distress ; but on the other hand nothing that exists , nothing whatever , remains altogether vulgar or dull and dead or hopeless in its light . . . . But the interest is shifted . The pomp and splendor of established order , the braying triumphs , ceremonies , consummations , ? one sees these glittering shows for what they are ? through their threadbare grandeur shine the little significant things that will make the future . " And the burden of his lecture The Discovery of the Future is that an inductive knowledge of the future is not only very largely possible , but is considerably more important for us than  | the study of the past . Even in the sciences , he says , the test of their validity is their power to produce confident forecasts . Astronomy is based on the forecast of stellar movements , medical science exists largely for diagnosis . It is this thought which determines the nature of his own sociology . There is usually something inept in speaking of a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ism . Socialism , in the common sense of the word , is a classification of men . Individual socialists are as a rule something more than socialists ; often they are socialists by necessity , or imagination , or sentiment , or expediency ? their socialism is not inherent , not the frame of their whole being . In the degree that socialism is a classification , or a school of thought , or an economic theory , the individual socialist will , in practice , make mental reservations from it . Now my whole aim in this paper has been to suggest that if socialism had not existed Wells would have invented it . It is not something which at a given moment or even after a long process of imaginative conversion or conviction came into his life . It is , in his own formulation of it , the projection of his whole nature , the expression of his will , the very content of his art . With one or two exceptions ? works deliberately devoted to propaganda or exposition ? even his purely sociological writings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures in them just as Catholicism figures in the masses of Mozart , or the brotherhood of man in the poems of Whitman , not as a cause but as a satisfying conception of truth . And just as , if one were to study the psychology of Mozart or Whitman , one would find habits of mind that inevitably produced the individual Catholicism of the one and the individual fraternalism of the other ; so behind the socialism of Wells are certain habits of mind , certain primitive likes , relishes , instincts , preferences : a faith in free will , a sense of order and the subordination of details to design , a personal detachment , a pleasure in construction , a curiosity about the future . These are innate qualities , which inevitably produced their own animating purpose .
