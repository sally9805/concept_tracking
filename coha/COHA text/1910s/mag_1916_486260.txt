Evidently the usual output at this season of handsome editions to serve as " gift " books has been checked by the war . There are no importations of this kind of book , and only a few American publishers have attempted to fill their place . One of these is the Penn Publishing Company , which brings out two extremely handsome volumes . Of these one is the story of " The Princess Pocahontas , " agreeably set forth by Virginia Watson , and plentifully illustrated with full-page George Wharton Edwards . The book is handsomely printed , and is in every way excellent of its kind . The price is $2.50 net . The other is " Vanished Towers and Chimes of Flanders , " a volume which the Penn Publishing Co. has also done well to issue at this time ( $5 net ) . Mr. George Wharton Edwards , who is responsible for both the text and the full-page colored plates , knows his subject well , and has earned the gratitude of the many who will increasingly cherish reminders of this picturesque region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here will be found in undisturbed peace the notable features of Dixmude , Ypres , Louvain , Douai , Oudenaarde , to mention but a few of the now conspicuous towns . The book is very handsomely published . From Scribners comes an attractively printed edition of Robert Louis Stevenson 's " The Black Arrow " ( $2.25 net ) , vigorously illustrated , with full-page colored plates , by N. C. Wyeth . The war is responsible for two volumes which make appropriate gift books . " France : Her People and Her Spirit " is the title of an informing book by Laurence Jerrold , written with the sympathy and insight that characterize this author 's writings on France . It is copiously illustrated , and is published by Bobbs-Merrill Co. ( $3 net ) . In " Stirring Deeds of Britain 's Sea-Dogs " ( McBride ; $1.50 net ) Harold F. B. Wheeler has compiled a good record of the more conspicuous actions , both by sea and land , in which the naval forces of Great Britain have played a part during the present war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrations . To the tragedy of war also is ascribed the publication by the Oxford University Press of an anthology of verse , with the title " The Book of Sorrow . " It is an admirably chosen selection by Andrew Macphail , which in this time of universal sorrow will no doubt bring comfort to many mourning hearts . In another way , the war no doubt plays a part In the inspiration of books like John Martin Hammond 's " Winter Journeys in the South " ( Lippincott ; $3.50 net ) , which serve to remind home-bound Americans of the advantages in climate and natural attractions possessed by sections of their own country . An attractive edition of Benjamin Franklin 's " Autobiography , " edited by Frank Woodworth Pine and illustrated by E. Boyd Smith , is brought out by Henry Holt &; Co. ( $2 net ) . Two thin volumes , " The Wise Man 's Story , " by Albert E. Bailey ( Pilgrim Press ; 75 cents net ) , and " When the Yule Log Burns , " by Leona Dalrymple ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some merit . The Macmillans , in publishing John Masefield 's " Salt Water Poems and Ballads , " in a pleasantly decorated volume ( $2 net ) , have put a desirable gift book within the reach of many . It contains twenty colored plates and twenty plates in black and white by Charles Pears . The Hales , who by a volume on New England recently added fresh interest to that well-trodden section of the country , have now turned South , and equally engage the reader by another product of their talents , Louise Closser Hale attending to the text and Walter Hale providing the attractive drawings ( " We Discover the Old Dominion " ; Dodd , Mead ; $2.50 net ) . Narrative and drawings alike are conceived in a holiday spirit of banter ; the book throughout is pleasantly informing . In " The Site of Saint Paul 's Cathedral , Boston , and its Neighborhood " ( Badger ; $3.50 net ) the author , Dr. Robert Means Lawrence , has performed the commendable task of tracing the ownership of a most interesting tract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which St. Paul 's Church was erected . The names Tremont , Winter , West , and Washington Streets , the boundaries of the plot , will in themselves sufficiently convey to any one familiar with Boston the rich traditions in which this volume deals . A fascinating book is " Old Seaport Towns of New England " ( Dodd , Mead ; $2.50 net ) , in which Hildegarde Hawthorne dips into the history and customs of Portland , Portsmouth , Newburyport , Salem , Marblehead , Province-town , and other ports north and south of Boston which have furnished traditions precious to any one loving the old , sturdy , seafaring types . The volume makes no pretence of being a formal history ; it Is " more in the nature of an afternoon tea chat . " " The Book of Boston , " which is written by Robert Shackleton and issued by the Penn Publishing Co. ( $2 net ) , is an informal guide to Boston and near-lying towns of New England . The author approaches his subject lovingly , with a view to inculcating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect and reverence for the best traditions of this section . The narrative is spiced by a generous supply of anecdotes , and there are a goodly number of attractive illustrations by R. L. Boyer . The renaissance through which Ireland has been passing makes timely Mr. Padraie Colum 's romance , " The King of Ireland 's Son . " As a conscious bit of archaizing this series of magical adventures , connected by a slender thread of story , is decidedly good . Mr. Colum is sufficiently versed in authentic Irish legend to prevent him in his own inventions from sinning against the underlying spirit of Irish romance . The book , which is charmingly illustrated by Willy Pogany , may be turned over with profit to children , yet parents will be tempted , after the " children 's hour , " to dip into it too . It is published by Holt ( $2 net ) . The Season 's Output of Juvenile Books " Pastoral-comical , historical-pastoral , tragical-historical , **36;1317;TOOLONG . " So classifies Polonius , and one feels inclined to adopt similar composite categories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement the heterogeneous mass of children 's books which annually at this season come from the presses . The tragical is happily lacking , but all of Polonius 's other classifications , and many others , are well represented . In sheer bulk a glance at the shelves would seem to indicate the predominance of what may be described as the " comical-pastoral . " For the entertainment of young children , in particular , authors appear to turn instinctively to the animal world . Almost every beast that came out of the ark serves its turn , but the milder creatures  --  dogs , cats , rabbits , and mice  --  seem to be the favorites , as they have always been . Thus we have an instructive series detailing the admirable example set by the " Nixie Bunnies " respectively in " Manners-Land , " in " Workaday-Land , " and in " Holiday-Land . " These three volumes are by Joseph Sindelar , attractively illustrated by Helen Geraldine Hodge , and published by the Beckley-Cardy Company , of Chicago . Another series , suitable for boys and girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrates entertainingly and in very elementary fashion the habits of all manner of animals , both those on the earth and those in the waters under the earth , is written by Thornton W. Burgess . Four more of these Bedtime Story Books ( Little , Brown ; 50 cents each ) are published this year , recording the adventures respectively of " Prickly Porky , " " Buster Bear , " " Old Man Coyote , " and " Old Mr. Toad . " The same author adds another volume to his Old Mother West Wind series with " Mother West Wind ' How ' Stories " ( $1 net ) , appropriately dedicated to " the cause of conservation of wild life . " The purpose of " Forest Neighbors , " by W. D. Hulbert ( Row , Peterson ) , is more frankly informative , and the tales of buck , beaver , porcupines , and lynx are well told .

The volume is published by Paul Elder &; Company , of San Francisco . Old fables , many of them from La Fontaine , are retold in Madge A. Bigham 's " Merry Animal Tales " ( Little , Brown ; 75 cents net ) , and " Animal Folk Tales " is a well-Planned volume , designed primarily for reading in schools , by Anne A. Stanley ( American Book Company ) . " Little White Fox and His Arctic Friends , " by Roy J. Snell ( Little , Brown ; 75 cents net ) , may be favorably mentioned as keeping close to nature . Albert Bigelow Paine continues his stories about the Hollow Tree with " Hollow Tree Nights and Days " ( Harper ; $1.50 net ) . For very young children we list the following : " The Tale of Tibby and Tabby , " by Ada M. Skinner ( Duffield ) ; " Bunny Rabbit 's Diary , " by Mary Frances Blaisdell ( Little , Brown ; 40 cents ) : " The Graymouse Family , " by Nellie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Work-a-Day Doings on the Farm , " by Emma Serl ( Silver , Burdett ) , and " The Clever Mouse , " by S. G. S. Perry ( Paul Elder ) . This is a convenient place also to notice two attractive volumes for small people , in which animals again play a not inconspicuous part : " Aunt Sadie 's Rhymes and Rhyme-Stories " ( Dutton ; $1.25 net ) is a book of simple and not unimaginative verses suitable for reading aloud and illustrated with the plain line drawings that children love ; " Stories to Tell the Littlest Ones " ( Houghton Mifflin ; $1.60 net ) is a m  --  lange of prose and verse by Sara Cone Bryant , with illustrations by Willy Pogany . For older children we find a real dog story of not a little merit in " Baidy of Nome , " the true tale of an Alaskan sled dog , by Esther Birdsall Darling ( Penn Publishing Company ; $1.75 net ) . Expanding our categories a trifle , we welcome several volumes as historical , historical-fictional , fictional-informational , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready sale is Harold F. B. Wheeler 's " Boy 's Life of Lord Kitchener " ( Crowell ) , a competent piece of work , in which the main facts and the most essential details of a great career are well told . For intelligent boys of any age , from , say , fourteen to twenty , it should be a welcome present . Samuel Clemens 's biographer , Mr. Albert Bigelow Paine , has performed a real service to the younger generation by condensing his Boswellian knowledge of his subject into a handy volume , entitled " The Boy 's Life of Mark Twain " ( Harper ; $1.25 net ) . The boyhood of another distinguished American man of letters , Edmund Clarence Stedman , whose life almost exactly coincided with that of Mark Twain ( he was both older than Mark Twain and predeceased him by two years ) , is recorded with considerable charm by Margaret Fuller in " A New England Childhood " ( Little , Brown ; $1.50 net ) . Still another biographical volume is Mary H. Wade 's " Pilgrims of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which tells the story of seven distinguished Americans not of the original stock , John Muir , Jacob Riis , Mary Antin , Edward Alfred Steiner , Carl Schurz , Nathan Straus , and Joseph Pulitzer . Fictional in form , but historical it essence , is a daintily told little fancy by Cornelia Meigs , entitled " Master Simon 's Garden " ( Macmillan ; $1.25 ) , in which the atmosphere of early Colonial days in New England Is well caught . Lucy Fitch Perkins goes back a great deal further than this with her " Cave Twins " ( Houghton Mifflin ; $1 net ) , which is designed to give small people some idea of how their remote ancestors may have lived . The dainty illustrations are , we fear , more attractive than is scientifically accurate . Two volumes calculated to give enviable thrills to healthy boyhood are published by Lippincott ( $1.25 net each ) , E. Keble Chatterton 's " Daring Deeds ? of Famous Pirates " and Ernest Young 's " Daring Deeds of Hunters and Trappers .
