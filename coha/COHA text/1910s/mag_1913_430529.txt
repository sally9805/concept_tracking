T N America there are three sexes ? men , women , and profes sors . It is the saying of European scholars looking from those self-governing democracies , their universities , upon ours . They see ours ruled without the consent of the governed through presidential autocrats by boards of non-scholar trustees ? not a part of the world of learning , but superimposed upon it . The American professor has the status of an employee subject to dismissal without trial by men not his colleagues . The universities of Germany , the older universities of Eng land and Scotland respect and trust and leave free the individual . Their organization gives them the right to regard themselves as provinces of the republic of letters . The overlorded universi ties of America have no such right . For a couple of centuries American professors have submit ted to a system which gives most of them little control over their own lives , small power to defend any truth which has powerful enemies , no part in shaping the policies of the institutions in which they teach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emerson , Emersonically oblivious of such little matters as despotic college government , held up a high ideal of independent manhood . The position of her scholars under the thumb of business men and capitalists who control the university purse is enough to account for the fact that America is intellectually second rate . Un less content to remain so Americans have got to think down to bedrock about university government and do what thought de mands . Feeling that something is wrong , we have begun to examine the life of our universities , but no general attention has centred as yet upon their inherited , undemocratic system of control which is bearing the fruit of timidity and subservience among those twenty-three thousand men and five thousand women whose so cial function it is to create and transmit American thought " The teaching of professors must be confined to classes au- thorized by the university , " said President Butler of Columbia to Professor George E. Woodberry . " You will have to limit your relations with students to such as are possible in the class-room . " This mandate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influencing the lives of his students in a way that reminded men of Jowett . Such an objection by a university president to the stimulating influence of a professor outside the class-room , and so beyond the president 's own control , is not , as might superficially appear , the mere tyrannical caprice of one exceptional individual . It is in line with the general subordination of scholar to administrator which lies like a black frost over the life of our institutions of learning . In Europe such intimate influence of teacher upon student is simply a matter of course . A man like Professor Dr. Ihne of Heidelberg is constantly having the Herrn . Studenten at luncheon or dinner at his villa . Every week or so the Freiherr von Waldberg used to meet students he attracted at a cafe such as the Garni Perkeo , where the group would sit stein in hand around a long table in a private room and talk ? sometimes brilliantly . In such little Kneipes throughout Germany live criticism of new-lit erary , philosophical , artistic , and scientific tendencies is born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rich in funds , our universities are poverty-stricken in that spir itual relationship of master and disciple which in its beauty and in its power to shape life takes rank with friendship and with love . Our professors are not in any sense Freiherrs ? free mas ters . Their humiliating dependence upon the will of other men deprives them of the spiritual qualities which create discipleship . We can not imagine an American professor standing for any truth as Haeckel stood for years at Jena fighting almost alone in Europe the cherished theological biology all but universally accepted then by scholars , by the people , and by official churches , but now accepted by no scholar . There was no board of finan cier trustees at Jena to tell IIaeckel to soft-pedal his subversive cVolutionary ideas and dismiss him without trial if he declined . In the recent popular articles and hooks on American col leges the most striking fact is an omission . The faculty does not  | appear as a factor in college life . The fact that men whose life business it is to study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying youth excites no comment . The typical student attitude is illustrated by a remark overheard in the Harvard Yard . An influential sophomore was moulding opinion concerning a certain course in philosophy . " He 's making that course too stiff for an undergraduate course , " he said . Interested in his own activities , the student regards a pro fessor 's course simply as a credit . Of these he is compelled to purchase with his time a certain number necessary for a degree . Occasionally he discovers a bargain , technically known as a snap , whereat he rejoices , despising however as easy the teacher from whom he can buy a credit so cheap . When , on the other hand , like the influential sophomore , he finds himself in a course which requires more than the average amount of study , he feels that he has been sold . " A fool and his study are soon parted . " That professor is a skinflint ; he sells a credit too high . But a teacher as a living mind aiding the growth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ever seen one ! Raising the standard of requirements , i. e. , the price of credits , does not in the least alter this radically vicious attitude . Nor is it primarily the fault of the student . It is not in human nature to have such a feeling toward live men lecturing on impor tant subjects . The students ' indifference is a consequence of the university policy of training , selecting , and suppressing teachers into saying what nobody will think of again outside the lecture room . Deprived of that freedom in which alone arise the daring , energy , and joy essential to creativeness , our teachers avoid ideas threatening change of things established with an instinct like that of certain animals avoiding poisonous plants . Such ideas might throw real light on life for youth , if youth could hear , but they endanger food and clothes and shel ter . We have enlisted the professor 's instinct of self-preserva tion against original and courageous thought . Revolutionists of every kind are sifted out of our faculties by prudent trustees . But half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind , and most of the others can not be understood save as resisters of revolution . These are the poles between which stream the currents of the world 's cre ative thought . Obscure them and scholarship goes groping through the world without a light ? as in American doctoral dis sertations . The American college is on trial . Men will not continue to spend four years of their youth in the pursuit of general culture and get so little of it . Professor Fife of Wesleyan thinks the colleges have deteriorated in the last half century . He notes the absence to-day among undergraduates of discussion of vital so cial and industrial problems , corresponding in our time to those problems of slavery and Darwinism with which the college at mosphere was electric in the middle third of the nineteenth cen tury . There may be some idealization of the past in this view , but there is no question about the absence of vital discussion of living questions in colleges to-day . Their graduates go out to blunder into understanding of the modern world ? perhaps through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misunderstand . " Where do they get that intellectual passion ? " exclaims the typical university man when he encounters those minds in which the real issues of modern life are burning their way to solution . The student does not get from his teachers even the kind of thinking which leads to understanding . He hears of no such thing as " the hierarchy of the sciences . " He gets no chart of the world of mind , no hawk's-eye view , no hint that there is hub and tire to the wheel of knowledge . All he gets is loose spokes ? without knowing they are spokes . In their individualistic , noncooperative , specialist departments , bound too tight administra tively and not related organically , the teachers themselves do not know it . Not being in possession of the elements , the very tools of thought , college graduates are reduced to that subservience to conventional ideas which is their most easily observable class characteristic . Some huge spiritual steam roller seems to have run over their individualities . Following conventional ideas is one practicable way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | thinking for himself must follow , not lead , and he can be led almost anywhere . The rules and statutes and restrictions of our universities show the least democratic organization and spirit of any in the world . Students are treated like irresponsible children-and respond to treatment . Great manuscript volumes record their absences from class . Faculty members have only a mockery of power , a vote on academic trifles ? the standard of admission , the grades necessary to pass a course , the grouping of studies which may be elected , whether or not " marks " shall be " open . " Even in such things they are not inclined to use their vote against the president upon whom they are dependent for continuance of position . They have no power over larger questions of univer sity policy , no power over expenditure of income . They may see money needed for necessary books or scientific apparatus going into unnecessary buildings , but can not stop it . The president is responsible not to them but to an outside board . The board members who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold their positions for life and are irre movable , as at Smith College , where a proposal to give the alumnae more representation on the board has just been hypocrit ically evaded . Sometimes the board is purely self-perpetuating , as at Columbia . On other boards , such as one of Harvard 's two , membership is for a term of years and graduates of five or more years ' standing are permitted to select by vote one among six or seven nominees for each vacancy . A glance at any particular list of these nominees shows them to be all men of the same social class and viewpoint . In State universities the regents are usually appointed by the governor . While there are capitalists among them , the typical regent has been appointed because the governor needed his po litical influence . Often the regent owns a newspaper . The boards of public and private institutions have in common the fact that the teaching scholars who are collectively the uni versity have no share whatever in the selection of their members and no check of any kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university , should there be a board of capitalists , lawyers , politicians , a board of non-scholar armed  | with that power of the purse which may be and is used to control and suppress the thought of scholars ? Logically there is no rea son . There should be no such board . Historically the reason is simple . We have inherited this undemocratic system from sev enteenth century America , and have as yet done nothing to demo cratize it . It had its origin not in democracy but in theocracy . Founded to educate ministers our colleges had to be organized to guard against the creeping in of heresy . A professor who became a heretic had to go , and there had to be machinery to see that he went . And there was . And that seventeenth century machinery has been kept in good working order right down to the thirteenth year of the twentieth century . In organizing State and nation after the revolution the antidemocracy represented by Hamilton had to compromise with a militant democracy , but in the theocratic college there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an America ruled by ministers to the America ruled by capitalists through lawyers was accomplished without spilling any of the absolutism of college government . It has been so little chal lenged that new universities have copied it mechanically from older ones . A professor is to-day dismissed , or asked to resign , or an instructor is not reappointed ? all without opportunity . for trial . In case he is informed of the disapproval of his " employers " before dismissal and given another chance he is simply , in the words of Judge Henry E. Holland , trustee of Yale , " hauled up before the board . " The board could officially decapitate him just to amuse itself if that happened to appeal to its sense of humor . But a professor need not even be " hauled up . " He may simply receive a letter notifying him that he is " relieved from further academic service , " the relief to begin that day , as in the case of President Butler 's letter of March 7 , 1911 , to Professor J. E. Spingarn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which does not claim to he a very democratic organization . A court-martial is not proverbially overcareful of the rights of the men it tries , but it recognises that there are such things . Not so the university trurtrc . The American professor has not even the right to be  | court-martialled . He is not judged like an army officer by his own colleagues . He is not judged like an American citizen by his peers . Democratic reform of this absolutist system is not going to come spontaneously from the present governing boards . They see no reason for dissatisfaction with an arrangement which places unlimited power in their hands . Not being men of imag ination they do not realize how degrading their rule is to the men they rule . Their satisfaction with things as they are can best be shown by quoting a few expressions of the principle of autocratic power by board members themselves . " The board of trustees are the ultimate authority , " J. W. Alexander , member of the board of trustees at Princeton , has said . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board would have to prevail . The professors would have to walk the plank . " Mr. F. W. Peck , director of Chicago University , has written : " The trustees should see to it that in teaching . . . no un sound financial doctrines nor anything of a dangerous character be taught . " Secretary Goodspeed of Chicago said : " On all questions in our university the final supreme authority is vested in the trus tees . " A Columbia trustee being asked , " Who is to decide whether the teaching of a professor is truth or untruth ? " replied : " The board must decide what is right or wrong . " Why have scholars at all if scholarship ? the conscience of the guild of scholars ? is not to decide what shall be taught ? In a printed statement J. H. Raymond , trustee of Northwestern University , has said of professors : " In social science and political science they , as a rule , are only a little less qualified to be the final arbiters as to what shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In all things they should promptly and gracefully submit to the final determination of the trustees . A professor must be an advocate , but his advocacy must be in harmony with the conclusions of the powers that he . " Mr. Raymond received many congratulations from university  | 452 THE FORUM authorities upon this uncompromisingly tyrannical position , and no protests from the teachers against whom the tyranny was directed . The incident helps to explain the European view of the third American sex , and prepares us for such books as the recent one by an instructor in journalism in the University of Wisconsin which gives instruction in the art of writing " apparently honest criticism " of plays in order to prepare the students for service on venial newspapers. * The American university president , though his own position is hardly more secure than that of his subordinates , is the instrument of the will of the boards . One such president , Thomas F. Kane of the University of Washington , is recently reported by students to have said to them : " Students must get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regents , for they are higher in authority . " The students asked him if they had no right to criticise the governor who appointed the regents . The president answered : " Not when he is on the campus . " As citizens of the State the students may criticise the head of the State , but as university men they may not criticise their academic superior . This principle means that democracy- has not yet begun in college , and it means the end of democracy should it spread from there and prevail . It does not occur to President Kane that when you have deprived members of a university of the right to criticise , which amounts to the right to think , you have destroyed the university 's reason for existence . There are university teachers who do not feel the pressure on faculties for the reason that they instinctively share the point of view of the members of their governing board . Besides the men who do not feel the pressure are those that yield to it . Their cases do not become known . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind is the silent tragedy of our university life . If difference with a board is not too vital the evil consequences fall short of dismissal . Promotion stops , as in the case of the popular Mr. Marckhardt of Michigan , an active socialist who has not been advanced in academic rank in spite of striking suc cess as a teacher . There was a similar lack of promotion of Triggs of Chicago for a number of years before his dismissal . The unconventional Mr. Copeland , whose play of mind and as thetic worldliness gave him more charm for students perhaps than any other man at Harvard , remained an instructor for years . Being a socialist may turn the scale against a man whose tenure is precarious for other reasons , as in the case of George Louis Arner , instructor in Economics at Dartmouth . His Ph.D . was in sociology instead of in economics , ' and his lecture form was not very good , but he influenced students . He was not reappointed the third year . The observable test of academic freedom comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which his gov erning board does not think , and he refuses to yield . Some cases may be recalled to indicate the kind of differences for which pro fessors " have to walk the plank . " There was a time when they were dismissed for views on free trade and greenbacks , as President George M. Steele of Law rence University back in 1892 . A whole crop of them went because they believed in free silver , like President E. B. Andrews and President H. E. Stockbridge of the North Dakota Agricul tural College . Some went for Populism , like Docent I. H. Hour wich of the University of Chicago . They went for " anti-imperi alism , " like President Henry Wade Rogers of North-western . They went because they were " anti-monopolistic , " like Frank Parsons and John R. Commons of the Kansas Agricultural Col lege and E. W. Bemis of the University of Chicago . Some went for " anti-plutocratic " ideas and acts , like President Thomas E. Will of the Kansas Agricultural College in ' goo . Professors have been ousted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) like Dr. J. H. Ward of Kansas . They have been appointed on condition they should not let it be known they were Unitarians , as in the case of Inis 11 . Weed , appointed  | Dean of Women on this condition a few years ago in the State University of Washington . A Russian has been offered an ap pointment as professor of French on condition that he change his Russian name to a French one . This was Lieut. - Col . Loch witsky , I. R. A. , who lives at 3543 Indiana Avenue in Chicago . The case of E. A. Ross of Stanford , dismissed for views on coolie immigration and municipal ownership , attracted more than usual attention simply because the suppression of opinion was the act , not as usual of a governing board , but of an individual , a founder of the university . Professors have been tried for sociological heresy , like Rich ard T. Ely of the University of Wisconsin . They have been let out for " applying " Christianity , like George D. Herron of Grinnell College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for standing by a colleague under fire . Of these are G. E. How ard of Stanford for protest against the dismissal of Ross , Presi dent George W. Gates of Grinnell for standing by Herron ( also for offending the school-book trust ) , and J. E. Spingarn dismissed after a fight growing out of the case of Harry Thurston Peck , who was dismissed for being sued for breach of promise . Nowadays the characteristic danger point for professors is industrial unionism , not so much " syndicalism " theoretically and in general as participation in some specific-industrial conflict . Col lege teachers are perfectly free to hold any opinions they please about such things ? provided they do not publicly express them . Getting a good hot socialist speech reported in the newspapers will sometimes do the business , as in the recent case of Kendrick P. Shedd of the University of Rochester , dismissed after twentytwo years of service for his speech at Auburn , N. Y. A vehement speech on a particular industrial situation will do it , as in the case of the speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turer in History in the Columbia extension work . Vida Scud der 's speech at Lawrence brought her the threat of dismis sal unless she could give assurance of non-repetition of the offence . This she declined to do and the threat was not carried out . Professors can lose their positions by admitting before a com mittee investigating the subject that the president of their uni- versity is a liar . This was the case of Professors Simms , An drews , and Van Steenderen of the University of Iowa . Out of hundreds of cases of academic unfreedom these must suffice to show that the principles of autocratic government enun ciated by board members are no dead letter , but are in active operation . The fear they inspire in American faculty men was strikingly illustrated when the Inter-collegiate Socialist Society first sent out letters asking indorsement of its object . This was not to make socialists , but " to promote an intelligent interest in socialism among college men and women . " The society found twentyseven professors , among them men of foreign culture like Pro fessor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their names appear as indorsers . But hundreds of letters were re ceived from men who said that while they were in sympathy with the proposed object they did not desire to have the fact made public . Over-timidity ? Yes . The over-timidity of the unfree . A revelation of the spiritual atmosphere of that subjected class to whom America sends its youth to be prepared for manhood . If the American college did no worse than reflect in miniature the capitalist oligarchy which more or less controls society as a whole , there would not be much hope of its reform before the reform , or revolution , of the rest of society . But existing col lege government is an absolutism unknown anywhere else in our life , and the absurdity of not intrusting with self-government a body of men as highly trained as a college faculty is glaring . Consequently a movement to bring the college abreast should have good hope of success at the present time . If the colleges refuse to come abreast we should stop send ing them our sons and daughters to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gone in for the production of a nation of slaves , the college professor of to-day , logical fruit of a despotic system , is too dangerous an example to set before the nation 's youth . The remedy for lack of freedom is self-government . The way to free a slave is to abolish the power of his master . The  | way to secure academic freedom and make university teachers free personalities is to transfer to them as a body the powers now held by outside boards , including the appointive machinery , the control of university finances , the right to select their own presi dent , and above all the power ? fatal and blighting when not in their own hands ? the power to terminate a scholar 's connection with his institution . The scholars of a university must collectively control their own incomes , that is , their own lives and thoughts . Educators must control education . If that is dangerous to the interest of any special class , so much the worse for it . Its interest has got in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governing power we can raise up a new breed of teachers ? men to whom the youth of the land can look for real light on life . Respected for the first time by themselves , by students , and by foreign scholars , such men will be free for significant thought and utterance , for real study and unflinching criticism of public affairs . " Great personalities are essential to any educational institu tion , " writes the president of Smith College arguing for raising salaries . More pay is obviously not remedy enough . A system which can and does cut off the income and career of a thinker who dares to advocate a conclusion not " in harmony with the con clusions of the powers that be " can not be expected to produce great personalities and has not done so . Real personalities , to say nothing of great ones , will continue to be few among college teachers until they are free from their present fear , restraint and subservience . The administrative heads of universities must be made re sponsible not to a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the teaching scholars . Since to abolish the existing boards would be considered too sharp a break with tradition , it will be easier as a matter of tactics to leave them in existence shorn of power . This can be accomplished by having the mem bers of the boards , like the presidents , elected by the teaching force . A cautious half-step in this direction was recommended by President Schurntan in his report last fall to the Cornell trustees .  | The proposal is to permit full professors to elect one third of the board of trustees . If adopted this plan will result in no transfer of power . It is interesting only as a possible first . step toward a university governed by its scholars . We should have a board of trustees of whom not merely a safe minority of one third , but all are elected by the faculty . We should have as electors not merely full professors but the whole body of teachers . Another step in a gradual elimination of the outside element would be to make faculty members eligible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governing board would be related to the faculty much as an English or French premier and his cabinet are related to parlia ment . A college president might well prefer to be the head of such a self-governing democracy of scholars rather than what he is . Other indications of pressure toward democracy are the com mittees at the Universities of Illinois and Washington to study the question of more democratic government . The Illinois com mittee was appointed three years ago and its report has not yet been published . These stirrings at Cornell , at Washington , at Illinois , and elsewhere , indicate that university self-government can be brought into the sphere of " practical politics " if means can be found of rousing intelligent public opinion to its importance . Public discussion is likely to bring up objections similar to those which arise in private discussions among university men . The three chief arguments seem to be that scholars in control would not get money , that professors do not desire freedom , and that they do not need power because their interests are being well looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is time our universities were using the great wealth they " already have for the ends of scholars instead of crushing down those ends wherever they conflict with the prospect of further " benefactions . " These cost too much in sac rifice of independence . Our universities are rich enough . If they are going to do no more than they have done for the world 's thought , for the kindling of intellectual passion , the wealth that  | has been showered upon them is all waste . The society of the future will not endure it . In productive funds Columbia has forty-four million dollars , Harvard twenty-five , Chicago seventeen , Yale nearly fourteen , Cornell over nine million . Of annual income Wisconsin , Minnesota , Pennsylvania , Yale and Michigan have over a million and a half . Chicago , Harvard , Illinois , and Cornell have over two million . Columbia does not say . The poorest of them has money enough to afford the luxury of unmuzzled scholarship . The American university which suc ceeds in replacing mercenary with intellectual passion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements of our life and in international standing than it will lose in those benefactions which are now acting as malefactions . If any endowment is held or support obtained under conditions incompatible with control by teachers , the quicker the universities let go of it the better . It is not more money they need , but free men . As to the second objection , that professors do not desire freedom ? it is really true that some of them argue against the need of it . They say they are paid to teach certain things in certain ways and that if they do not want to do it they are free to leave . The argument betrays their indifference as to whether their university is perverting or fulfilling its social function . Such mat ters have been relegated to the trustees . The teacher 's apathy is a psychical result of lack of responsibility . The argument against freedom by men deprived of it is not unfamiliar . These are not the first slave advocates of slavery . The overthrow of such a system is likely to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swift . We shall always have the plant animal justifying the sessile mode of life . The third argument is current at Columbia . Some profes sors there argue that they do not need any more power because there is a commission at Columbia " studying the high cost of living with a view to raising professors ' salaries . " Since there is a disposition on the part of trustees to raise salaries , since sab- batical year privileges are being extended , since the interests of college teachers are being so well looked after by the masters under the present system , what need to change ? Since our des potism is benevolent why incur all the trouble and risk of a strug gle for freedom ? The answer is that unfortunately such comfortable accept ance of benevolent despotism produces the third American sex . It sterilizes the intellectual life of university and nation . It is still true that despotism can not be accepted nor freedom renounced without serious spiritual consequences . They are observable in teachers who do not desire freedom of teach ing . Such narrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what chance there is for improvement . Here is the vicious circle which exists between every tyranny and its victims . Lack of power produces subservience of spirit , and sub servient spirits are not fit for nor able to attain power . Is there any way out ? . There would be none if all American professors were plant animals . But the men who have refused to knuckle down , the men who leave because the university as it is cramps growth , are evidence that a certain proportion of American scholars will not accept the sessile mode of life . It is to this kind of men still inside the faculties that we must look for revivification of the uni versities . All that part of American society which can still appreciate the need of intellectual freedom should try to induce these poten tially valuable faculty rebels to discontinue the futile old method of petty individual rebellion . Instead of revolting and being eliminated one or two at a time , leaving the system unchanged , they must get together and transform the system . Even a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause before dismissing such a group . Half its faculty a real university could hardly drop , though the thing has been done at Marietta and other little sectarian colleges . An entire faculty standing together could secure in a short time the powers of university government . That there is no faculty capable of such solidarity is of course  | true . But it is also true that no faculty is without a certain num ber of men capable of standing together for their guild interests . It is these who ought to be organizing and centering upon the immediate object of securing for faculties the right to elect their own president and trustees . The . tension of such a movement would from its inception end the spiritual inertia complained of in our colleges . There have been individuals preaching the gospel of internal self-government . The writings of Professor Cattell of Colum bia and those of his contributors in his weekly Science have not been without effect in bringing about the significant recommenda tion at Cornell . His recent volume University Control contains a valuable referendum showing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academic position favor a change of our absolutist system of university government . What is sorely needed now is not the intermittent work of individuals , but a campaign conducted systematically by a per manent organization . This could bring Cattell 's Columbia liter ature to bear effectively upon the situation at the University of Washington , and make what Professor Guido Marks does at Stanford help the cause of self-government at Columbia . Sci ence has made itself a focus of the intelligent discontent of uni versity teachers , but only the roused opinion of a much wider public can force the present governing boards to relinquish power . Faculty men should create an organization to create that opinion . In the past the arbitrary power of presidents and trustees has frequently suggested such cooperation of college teachers , but at this point the idea has been habitually disposed of by some one saying with a laugh " Brain Workers No. 1 , " or " the Profes sors ' Union . " That seemed to settle it . Shrinking instinctively from the application of the working class method to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously the only line of action likely to lead to their independence . How much of the ridiculousness of the phrase " professors ' union " is due to the fact that professors as we know them , dissociated from the idea of power and manhood , are in themselves somewhat ridiculous ? It is perhaps because we are not accustomed to look to them for anything re- quiring so much guts as the formation of a union that the two ideas " professor " and " union " clash . But " union " is capable of taking " professor " out of the category of the ridiculous . An ex-professor of international reputation who rebelled with the sympathy of certain colleagues against a piece of adminis trative domineering brings against organization the objection , sustained by his own experience , that college teachers " lie down . " But it has been in the individual fights of other men that they have lain down . It is yet to be demonstrated that they would abandon a battle for their common cause . They have quit in spontaneous , socially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general revolt made for a principle to which by orga nizing they had pledged themselves in advance ? Or is there no principle for which they would so pledge themselves ? In either case we should have to give them up , and stop send ing people to college . But we should not , like many radicals , give up the colleges on suspicion , a priori , because till now they have been inert . We have spent too much money and life on them to abandon them hopelessly to reaction without a determined ef fort on the part of friends of intellectual freedom to democratize them . The strength attainable by organization of the living element among the college teachers themselves is too valuable for them to permit either a ridiculous phrase or a professional prejudice or the fear inspired by their own past weakness to stand in the way . There is as much need for the college teachers to overcome the obstacles , trivial and.serious , that retard organization as there was for primary teachers when they first formed their " fed erations . " While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are being made the basis of a manifesto of a new rad ical organization of the high school teachers of New York City . In the matter of . a " union " the college teachers have not only the example of the primary school teachers and the second ary school teachers , but also that of the heads of their own in stitutions . There is a college presidents ' union . It is not a mod est organization . It calls itself " The Association of American Universities . " The name expresses the prevalent presidential  | belief , unfortunately based on fact , that there is nothing much to a university but president . Unlike most other labor organizations , the C. P. U. or Col lege Presidents ' Union holds its sessions in secret . It may be a little sinister , but it is not ridiculous . It has power . It has the authority delegated to their instruments by the omnipotent but non-executive trustees . That is the power whose possession would make the C. T. U. , the college teachers ' union , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and powerful type of scholar , is an important interest of American society . But everybody 's busi ness being nobody 's , this is the special business of the college teachers themselves . The interest of society as a whole coin cides with their guild interest . Being unable to fulfil their social function without the governing power it is their highest duty to demand it and not to quit until they get it . Society should hold them responsible if they do not . The scholars ' guild ? to choose a name which helps to reveal the true ultimate aim of such an organization ? has not merely as reason for existence its present practical fighting advantages and the accomplishment of the immediate object of securing uni versity self-government . Looking out beyond that , it is a neces sity as the germ of an essential social organ . Society begins to reveal its new structure ? a federation of productive industries and social activities each governed from within and all coordinated . If among these there should be no organ of scholarship industrial , society will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like the other.unions that compose it theirs must be free but responsible , self-guided but not self-willed , governed not from without as now through economic power in the hands of another class , but from within by the high technical conscience of the guild . The lack of solidarity with the majority of the nation which has characterized our intellectual class ? its mistaken mental identification of itself with the ruling class ? has filled the labor movement with bitter contempt for " intellectuals . " Because of the upper class color of " culture " the working class is growing inimical to culture itself . If the intellectual class fails to orga- nize and strengthen itself and get itself into right relations with the working class which is the nation , the coming supremacy of that working class may sweep away ? wheat with chaff ? the cul ture of the world . Instead of that , scholars aware and worthy of their function and having the courage to fulfil it can make their guild the centre of the world 's new mind ? the social organ by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively upon the present . Education is the chief occupation of one quarter of the pop ulation ? at the present time in round numbers 600,000 teachers and twenty million pupils and students . Eventually this whole sphere of life must be in the control of one big union . But this can not be lumped amorphously into one structureless mass . Inside its unity the primary school teachers , secondary school teachers , college teachers , and university research workers will each have to hold themselves free of the others for their own characteristic development . The primary school teachers are already feeling more and more conscious of their collectivity and its function . The college teachers may come belated , but they must come to feel the one ness , in a single but differentiated organization , of all who teach . No vision of the future , of course , can have dynamic power to start a movement of college teachers . A far , fine goal can have value only to a movement that has started . What can and should start it is the pressure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government of teachers by trus tees which is spoiling the lives and work of our scholars and thereby doing serious damage to the higher life of America .  |
