' THIS week E. P. Dutton will publish : " Faery Tales of Weir , " L by Anna McClure Sholl ; " Life After Death , " by James H. Hyslop ; " Counter Attack , " by Siegfried Sassoon ; " Mother 's Nursery Tales , " by Katherine Pyle . The January publications of Frederick A. Stokes Company include : " That 's Me All Over , Mable , " by Edward Streeter ; " The Buccaneer Farmer , " by Harold Bindloss ; " A Popular History of France , " by B. Van Vorst ; " Yashka , " by Maria Botchkareva . This company has taken over from the Macmillan Company the works of Alfred Noyes . TN the general preface to his collected Works Mr. Hardy has observed " how much more concise and quintessential expression becomes when given in rhythmic form than when shaped in the language of prose . " Had he accepted this principle Dr. J. H. E. Crees would have shifted the avenue of approach in his " George Meredith : A Study of his Works and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poems not as a mere subsidiary off-shoot of the novelist 's achievement but as containing the quintessence of Meredith 's thought . The even more limited audience to which the poetry , as compared with the novels , appeals does not hinder it from being the centre around which the novels are grouped as a more elaborate commentary upon certain relatively restricted phases of human experience . In one of his letters Meredith remarks that " novel-writing embraces only a narrow portion of life . " Dr. Crees himself admits that the novels depict one distinct and highly artificial type of civilization and that it is " the wealthy , landed , and often culfured class with which Meredith mainly concerns himself . " The poems , on the other hand , range at will from Apollo and Skiagenia to Attila and King Harald and thence to " The Old Chartist , " to aspects of " Modern Love , " and to the feminist movement . All life is called upon to illustrate the philosophy of Earth . It may be granted , with Dr. Crees , that " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that " poetry is a matter of nice equipoise , " and that " this due equipoise Meredith rarely achieved . " Yet verse has a way of outlasting prose , and taking into account the mass of impedimenta that Meredith 's novels carry with them  --  the burden of over-subtle epigram and half-hinted metaphor , pitiless ellipsis and constant " inter-drone "  - -   - -  it may be prophesied that part at least of his poetry will travel further down the years than his prose , and will command an audience choice though spare when the novels , despite the evidences of their now increasing popularity assembled by Dr. Crees , and his confident assertion of their " immortality , " will have attained the limbo of scholarly research . The point upon which the entire system of Dr. Crees 's defence pivots is the contention that for the more precise analysis of character that Meredith , as compared with earlier novelists , undertook , he " was constrained to adopt elaborate or even labored methods of expression . " Such an argument makes a virtue of a limitation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's novels or of some of the masterpieces that have come out of Russia in the last half century has the proofs to support a denial that profound knowledge of life and character can not find expression in a perfectly lucid style . The argument is , moreover , unfair to Meredith , whose allusive style is due rather to his habit of assuming that his reader 's intellect is keen and sympathetic than to any defective power of expression . Dr. Crees does not sufficiently differentiate between two points of view from which the novels may be regarded . As pamphlets , as " Tracts for the Times " they must become every year of less value ; the radical of yesterday is the conservative of to-morrow . Meredith , the sharp but kindly critic of certain definite abuses in Victorian England , will soon be of historical interest only . It is the dissector of motive , the analyst of character , and the painter of a glorious gallery of superwomen that will be remembered in the future , and be read by those who , for the sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardships that confront them in his novels . The title of Dr. Crees 's book notwithstanding , little is contributed towards the understanding of the " personality " of this brave , sturdy , and stubborn man of genius ; a more ample use of the two volumes of letters might have supplied what is wanting in this respect . What is most commendable in the study is the nice judgment that selects the proper novel to illustrate each separate phase of Meredith 's survey of Victorian society . Not least among his tributes to Meredith is Dr. Crees 's own style with its prodigality of metaphor , allusion , and epigram . II T is curious to compare " The Writings of Ivan Panin " ( I. Panin , Grafton , Mass. ; $2.50 ) with the latest book by Stephen Graham , " The Quest of the Face " ( Macmillan ; $1.75 ) . In the first case we have a Russian who has been subject to New England influences for more than a quarter of a century . The Russification of Mr. Graham , the Englishman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious , both are earnestly in quest of Christ . Mr. Panin 's Byzantinism has gradually crystallized into a rationalistic worship of the Scripture . New England has evidently smothered his Slav emotionalism and has endowed him with the faculty of sound reasoning and clear thinking . Unfortunately the major portion of Mr. Panin 's " Writings " possesses a clearness that borders on the obvious ; of the 3156 aphorisms there are but few that are not platitudinous . More complex is the mixture of the Byzantine and the Puritanic in Mr. Graham . By following his books , which have appeared in perhaps too rapid succession , one might have observed his growing leaning toward Eastern mysticism . It is apparent that he has been profoundly influenced by the Moscow Bogoiskateli ( God Seekers ) , the circle of Merezhkovsky , Bulgakov , Prince Eugene Trubetskoy , and other Neo-Christians who strive to find a synthesis between Man-God and God-Man . Mr. Graham 's " Quest " is throbbing with that pathos of sincerity and broad sympathy and love which is imbibed by a disciple of Dostoievsky . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occasional shallowness of the author 's metaphors , and for his failure to discriminate between the symbolic and the allegoric in art and in life . OSTOIEVSKY had said concerning " The Cloak , " one of the - I-  " stories in the volume " Taras Bulba and Other Stories " ( Dutton ) , by N. V. Gogol : " We have all come out of the Cloak . " Indeed , Gogol was the first Russian realist to strike the keynote of sympathy with the lowly . His romantic tale , " Taras Bulba , " depicts the Cossacks of mediaeval Ukraine in colors more glowing than truthful  --  a fact which may be explained by the nostalgia which Gogol felt for his native Little Russia while he resided in the cold , official St. Petersburg . The introduction by Mr. Cournos presents a succinct sketch of the history of Ukraine and of Gogol 's attitude towards his home-province. 0 meet the sudden flare of democracy , sweeping to-day I through every European nation , H. Nelson Gay is preparing for the Italians and printing at Florence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Americani Illustri , " Firenze : R. Bemporad &; Figlio ; 50 cents ) . While the list of names appears , at first glance , somewhat miscellaneous , it is really strung around the thought of republicanism . Statesmen , soldiers , and poets compose the group , with an evident attempt to make a wide popular appeal . That Mr. Gay himself puts the books into Italian is not stated ; but surely Owen Wister , Barrett Wendell , and Henry Dwight Sedgwick can not all be possessed of so fluent a Tuscan style . Each volume is introduced by a well-known Italian writer . The biographies of Abramo Lincoln and Tomasso Jefferson are written in a flowing , short-sentenced manner , very different from that employed by the ordinary Italian historical writer . Martini 's preface to the biographyof Lincoln is of this old-fashioned elaborate phraseology ; in the " life " itself we discover a high class type of newspaper writing . The purpose of the book is so excellent and the performance so good that it is invidious to criticise ; but the editor has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his heroes into Italian forms . He has not modified the names of his authors . " Giovanni Hay . Di William Roscoe Thayer " is ? absurd ! Nor are all his heroes so metamorphosed . Edgar Allen Poe is not Edgardo . Walt Whitman defies the transcriber . Thomas Nelson Page , who writes the volume on Lincoln , has shown real genius in linking Lincoln with the people he addresses ; for he states on the first page that the great American was a contemporary of Garibaldi and closes his book with a quotation on Lincoln from that national hero . The introductions are ecstatic with appreciation for the United States . M ISS SHEILA KAYE-SMITH 'S latest book , " Little Eng- vland " ( Nisbet ) , is rather a series of character sketches than a novel . The characters , whose names appear as headings to the chapters , are the inhabitants of a Sussex hamlet , Sunday Street , and include the squire , the parson , the Particular Baptist minister , and a yeoman family named Beatup , with their friends and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study in their reactions to the war and to their environment . A sort of rural tragedy is disclosed in the experience of the Beatups . The father drinks periodically and leaves the management of the farm to his efficient elder son , Tom . When the latter fails to convince the local board that a tippling sire is valid cause for exemption , the care of the place devolves upon the second son , Harry , a flighty youth who , however , is sobered by responsibility and makes a success of his new undertaking . Then Tom gets shot at the front , and , in the last chapter , Harry is called to the colors , the board still remaining inexorable . In the matter of character sketching it is essential not only that it be done well , but that the characters be worth sketching , and in the present case we hardly think the dramatis personae are worth writing about . Their dialect is that to which Miss Kaye-Smith 's other books have accustomed , but not reconciled us . We sincerely hope that no people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an honest gutter . When the rain poured down upon the roof the gaping monster of the heavy leaden gutter sprinkled a generous torrent upon the passers-by , both innocent and other . The small and large deeds of the Allied soldiers are in a similar way gathered by the industrious publisher and poured upon the reading public with the indiscrimination of the gargoyle . " The Flying Yankee " ( Dodd , Mead ; $1.35 ) , by Flight , whirls down upon us from the sky . " Naval Heroes of To-day " ( Century ; $1.50 ) , by Francis A. Collins , fires broadsides from our mightiest battleships . Neither book is good . Neither book is bad . They are both war-books written by fairly incompetent pens . The reader who cares for literature mixed with his martial exploits is referred to Lord Dunsany 's " Tales of War " ( Little , Brown ; $1.25 ) , a small volume that shows charm of imagination which does not leave the author even amid the grime and misery of his Inniskilling Batallion . Meanwhile , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fighting Mascot " ( Dodd , Mead ; $1.35 ) . It is the story of a boy , Tommy Kehoe , who enlisted at a fantastic age to go and kill Germans . The director of the Library Department of the American Boy Scouts predicts that this book will prove " the biggest and best boy 's book of the war for many years to come . " From a fair personal experience of actual warfare we beg to differ with this statement . The sooner such books are forgotten ? the sooner the Tommy Kehoes and the Empeys and their colleagues are back at their allotted tasks , the better it will be for our own children and the world in which they will be obliged to live . These are immoral books . They are published because the publisher sees a chance to make an immediate hit with an exciting story , and so sets an experienced writer upon the trail of a " cockney-kid " to get " his dope . " The boy talks , the writer writes , and the publisher gathers his profit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not make it any better . HE Rev. Burris A. Jenkins believes with Horace that ridendo dicere vera is legitimate enough ; and if , in his little book , " The Protestant , " ( Christian Century Press ; $1.35 ) , he sometimes almost borrows the tone of the redoubtable Mr. Sunday , for the most part the volume is inoffensive and amusing . He dedicates it to " The Bravest Men I Ever Knew  --  the Heretics , " and it is clearly intended to prepare the way for a great Protestant  --  a second Luther . Mr. Jenkins distinctly disavows any constructive purpose . By way of proving the need of a Protestant , Mr. Jenkins compiles a formidable list of things to be protested against , in the van of which he places the Creeds . Of these he says : " Creeds paraded in public are highly egotistical , immodest , indecent . They are like taking off your clothes in the market square to reveal your bare soul . I protest against your doing it . The police should be called in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit me ; and my creed will fit nobody else . Two pairs of feet were never made alike . The agony of trying to make the curves of mine fit into the old shoes of another man 's that fit him like the paper on the wall ! My creed only irks you . Yours only makes me tired and sore ; that is if we try to wear one another 's . If we each only let the other fellow alone to wear his own , we are perfectly comfortable . " Then there is Bibliolatry , against which the coming champion must vigorously protest : " Thou shalt have none other Gods but me ; and yet Protestantism for three hundred years has been worshipping parchment and ink . The Catholics worshipped an old man in a white robe . Protestantism felt the need of some such figure-head . . and so set up the Bible in loco dei . There must be a seat of authority in religion , said Protestantism . Must there ? I am not aware of the necessity . . . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seat of authority . Strength to his elbow ! " I N August of the year 1914 the German commercial fleet dis-appeared from the seven seas . The work of forty years of minute and careful expansion was undone in a single thoughtless minute . German trade in Africa and Asia and South America and Australia was dead . America was the heir apparent . England and France were otherwise occupied . The small neutral nations of Europe , deprived of coal and raw materials , were of no great account . And every newspaper of this vast country wrote a solemn editorial and said , " The time has come to consolidate our expansion in all quarters of the globe . " That was over four years ago . But recently one of the great men of the largest and most powerful state of the great southern continent ( in a burst of unexpected confidence ) said : " During the war we have been obliged to come to America for our products . America is the sole and only purveyor of goods . But now that the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the Germans give us what we want and the Americans give us what they think we ought to want . " Our French and English friends have taken a very different interest in the matter . While the wisdom of our rulers discontinued the study of German and restricted the knowledge of the language of the enemy , France and England have encouraged their people to learn the enemy tongue with a vengeance . They knew that the competitor of to-morrow must be attacked and forestalled even while the war was going on . They were convinced that language is the best key to the psychology of the enemy . They studied his mind through literature . They prepared themselves to meet the foe upon his own ground . Hence such books as this latest volume of Professor Henry Hauser , " Germany 's Commercial Grip of the World " ( Scribner ; $1.50 ) . It is an excellent book , giving careful enumeration of all the facts which for almost half a century contributed to Germany 's economic success ; a scientific discussion of the German banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grant his long-time credits ; and athorough account of the steamship lines and other means of transportation which covered the whole earth with a network of routes for big and small vessels , obeying orders given from an office building in Hamburg or Bremen . Finally Dr. Hauser offers an unbiassed study of that omnipresent Prussian " State " which guided every footstep of its subjects and backed up the commercial and industrial expansion of territories which were part of competing imperial systems . T T is difficult to mention with restraint such a book as " The Human Side of Animals " ( Stokes ; $1.25 ) by Royal Dixon . It is cowardly to attack the modern discoveries and achievements of scientists and naturalists by undermining the only foundation upon which they can build  --  the truth , and it is little short of blasphemous to pretend to lead little children through truth , beauty , and love to Nature , with frequent references to God and the Bible , through a whole volume tissued with misstatements . The quotations and alleged facts in the book are drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Mr. Dixon 's own discursions would be amusing if they were not so unfair , whether from ignorance or not , to the recent labors of real nature-lovers and naturalists . As one example from many scores take the use of fire by apes . This , if true , would be a matter of the utmost importance in the past history of man , and yet the author bandies it casually about , asserting it on pages xx , 147 , and 148 , and denying it on page 127 . Is this the way to lead little children to truth ? Munchausen himself would envy the imagination which tells of the home-life of the " nkengos " ( wild animal-men ) , or the zebras which have bad dispositions because they live in the same part of Africa with the bad cannibalistic Hottentots ! Even our best-known animals become unrecognizable when handled by Mr. Dixon . Imagine a man writing books about trees and birds and animals , who solemnly tells his readers that the common woodchuck of North America obtains his food through the long , hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can catch fish and small animals that live in or near the water . " That is enough to make the real victim of this Gulliver 's tale groan in his upland home , and turn over in the midst of his deep hibernation sleep ! It is bad enough directly to misrepresent Nature and to quote from volumes which no real naturalist would have on his shelves , but to do this in the name of truth , beauty , and the Bible , to call on little children to believe these false things as manifestations of God 's goodness  --  this is indeed unworthy of any red-blooded man who lives on the earth and day by day looks his fellows in the eyes . It is , in fact , one of the worst cases of nature faking that have recently come under our notice , and is for this reason , a dangerous book to put into the hands of inexperienced and uncritical persons , to whose all too large stock of misinformation it may add very considerably . nURING the last six years some interesting evidence has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately the site and position of the newly-discovered human remains have not been so definitely diagnostic as to preclude disagreement on the exact age . In Argentina remains of Toxodon ( a generalized Ungulate family of animals which lived in Tertiary times ) were unearthed with a nicely shaped quartzite arrow point imbedded in the bone of the upper leg . Human bones were discovered by the Yale Peruvian Expedition near Cuzco , buried beneath nearly one hundred feet of gravel , their age being estimated at from twenty to forty thousand years . More recently in an asphalt lake in California the skeleton of a small human female was found associated with the bones of many modern animals , bears , wolves , antelopes , mice and eagles , together with a giant condor-like bird . At Vera , Florida , two skeletons were washed out of sand in which were numerous Pleistocene remains of sloths , horses , mammoths , and camels .
