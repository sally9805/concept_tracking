 | IT WAS July 1 , 1863 , and on Cemetery Ridge was posted this sign : ALL PERSONS FOUND USING FIREARMS IN THESE GROUNDS WILL BE PROSECUTED WITH THE UTMOST RIGOR OF THE LAW ! For the failure to enforce it you must blame old John Burns , for he was the Constable of Gettysburg ; but the Majesty of the Law was himself blazing away with a borrowed gun . And , as accessory before the fact , you must indict the man who had the shoe store ; for he , and not Hooker , Meade , or Lee , brought on the battle of Gettvsburg . A detachment of men in blue with holes in their shoes came into town to clean out the store , and at the same time came a detachment in gray with no shoes at all ; and then the village ordinance against the promiscuous use of firearms began to go to pieces . It was about nine o'clock , the hour when the young men up at the Lutheran Seminary were accustomed to settle down to the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came . Heth 's gray-coated shoppers were coming leisurely down the pike , expecting to find only militia lined up on the village green ; but Buford had swung a skirmish line of cavalry across the road and was now climbing into the steeple of the Seminary to see if the Army of the Potomac were anywhere on the map of Gettysburg . Hotfoot down the other road came Wisconsin , Indiana , and Detroit ? men with three days ' blisters On their feet and badlv in need of a bath ; but they had been to breakfast , which was the main thing . It was Meredith 's Iron Brigade and better men never wore the Blue . ' T ai n't no militia , " said a lank Alabamian to a fellow prisoner shortly afterward ; " it 's them darn black-hatted fellers agin ! " And the depressing thought of having been captured by Pennsylvania militia was lifted . General Doubleday was waiting for the Black Hats at the edge of the woods where Reynolds fell . Through the bushes on the other side of Willoughby 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to Doubleday a matter of supreme importance that this strip of woods be held . He therefore besought the Iron Brigade , by all the gods of Michigan , Wisconsin , and Indiana , to hold it until the rest of the First Corps came up . He was so insistent about it that somebody hurled back the retort : " If we ca n't hold it , where will you find the men who can STRAIGHT into the unexpectant gray line they went , double-quick , not even stopping to load their old-fashioned guns ; this was work for the bayonet , and the Iron Brigade were skilled workmen . And at the first swoop they cut off a surprised detachment , including Brigadier-General Archer , commanding . It was Patrick Maloney of the Second Wisconsin ( it is suspected that he was Irish ) who captured Archer . Marching him to the rear where General Wadsworth sat , he saluted . " Gineral Wadsworth , I make you acquainted with Gineral Archer . " Then he hastened back to his regiment , and died on the firing-line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By eleven o'clock it had swept the invaders from the field , and both sides leisurely refilled cartridgeboxes . Then Heth 's distant artillery began to serve lunch ? grape and canister and shells that tore great holes in the landscape . Doubleday knew this was the forerunner of grim work for the infantry , and he viewed with satisfaction the arrival of General Roy Stone and his brigade of " Bucktails , " who were now to fight on the soil of their own Pennsylvania . " We 've come to stay ! " - they called out as they went to their post ? and nearly three fourths of then staved . Seldom on this continent has there been such desperate fighting as took place that first afternoon , fighting which has been slighted by nearly every historian of the Civil War in his eagerness to reach the last day . When Hancock rode in with dripping horse to take command , he found only one third of Meade 's army with which to hold off two thirds of Lee 's ? and the vanguard of the Gray was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alongside Pickett on the third day . The outer line of Blue began slowly to melt away under volleys at twenty paces , and then Pettigrew 's superb brigade of North Carolinians struck the second line squarely . Bravely it stood , and Heth pauses in his report to pay this fine tribute : " When the Twenty-sixth Regiment encountered the second line of the enemy , his dead marked his line of battle with the accuracy of a line at dress parade . " One wing at last gave way , and the other had to follow ? not in a panicstricken rush , but in one heroic stand after another , all the way back to the village . The Twenty-fourth Michigan , of the Iron Brigade , left behind it seven distinct rows of dead to show that this was no Bull Run . IT is all over now , and Gettysburg is in the hands of the Southern army . Here on Cemetery Ridge , with the shadows of the tombstones lengthening as the sun goes down , the Iron Brigade lines up for the saddest roll-call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore the brunt of the attack , the Twenty-fourth Michigan has 97 men left ; under the flag of the Nineteenth Indiana stand only 78 , and but 69 men of the Second Wisconsin answer to their names . These are all that is left ? not one company to a regiment . Here is the beautiful flag that Detroit gave to the Twenty-fourth Michigan as it- left for the front ; now it is so riddled and torn that it is " unfit for further service , " and is going back to the city that gave it . Of the eight successive colorbearers who carried this flag during the day , seven lie out yonder in the woods ? four of them dead . Twice during the fight , Colonel Morrow took it in his own hands ; there it was when a ball struck  | him down , and he is now a wounded prisoner . A private grasped the flag as the colonel fell , and went on ; then the colors disappeared . When the captain commanding the regiment at length found them , the bearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . NOW all that has been told here is but a cross-section of the first day 's fight -- a story which has been taught to hundreds of thousands of school-children in these commonplace words : The Confederate advance unexpectedly met the Union cavalry just westward from Gettysburg , on the Chambersburg road . Reinforcements came up on both sides ; but the Federal troops were finally forced hack , and , becoming entangled in the streets of the village , lost many prisoners . The stars that sentineled the untroubled field above came to their posts one by one and looked down on Gettysburg . The village was dark and hushed and fearful . Weary columns of gray men were stumbling through the darkness to new positions , with horse artillery rumbling slowly by , and mounted staff officers hurrying to and fro . And the legions of Meade were coming in one by one and taking their position in the long line that extended from Culp 's Hill nearly to Round Top . BUT the dark of the gloomy woods hid even from the pitying stars the ranks of stiffening bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ear of heaven surely did not hear the piteous moaning  | for water that came from the parched throats of mangled thousands . The village of Gettysburg had its John Burns , but it had no Gunga Din ; they who looked out from their doorways and begged the Iron Brigade not to leave them in the enemy 's hands went not out to give its dying men the blessing of a last drink of creek water . And it was July weather . And if you would grasp the real horror of Gettysburg , hear the story of the wounded in Detroit . They fell , already parched with thirst , on the afternoon of the 1st ; not until the night of the 3d came water and medical attention . Their leader , Colonel Morrow , had been left on the field : before he fell into the enemy 's hands , he tore the straps from his shoulders to conceal his rank . A considerate officer took notice of his wound , and allowed him to remain in the village in a private house instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third day , after Pickett 's charge , word came to Morrow that his wounded were still lying where they fell . Binding a surgeon 's sash about his arm , he went to look for then . On the way he ran plump into John B. Gordon and staff . He explained to the Confederate general why he , a prisoner , was at large , and the chivalrous Gordon instantly responded . A staff officer was despatched to withdraw Confederate ambulances from Pickett 's field , and bring them to Doctor Morrow , whose rank Gordon knew but did not disclose . And the wounded colonel rested not until he had brought in the  | last of his suffering men , whose lips were so swollen and cracked with thirst that they could no longer speak . And that also is but a small part of the story of Gettysburg . The Second Day THIS is Longstreet Day , and the chilled-steel brigades of Hood 's division are coming on the field . Longstreet rides rapidly to Lee for orders , and finds his work all cut out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the Chief uses for his hardest hitting . While the first-corners are resting by the roadside , we may ride down the line and size up Longstreet 's men . Never was a great army that looked less soldierly . Their uniforms of all sorts are muddy and worn ; their faces are cov- ' ered with scraggly beards and many are barefoot ; and the lucky ones are chewing tobacco . It is not an army that would enthuse a European military attache ? but over there on Cemetery Ridge is a long line of Blue that holds Longstreet 's men in high regard . Here at the head is Toombs 's old Georgia Brigade , ? now commanded by Benning , ? Anglo-Saxon to the last man . It is no better than the others , but it is more interesting when you know that this small brigade will sleep victorious to-night ( what is left of it ) in " the Devil 's Den , " near to the summit of Little Round Top . It has been in active service since early in ' 61 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its original regiments . But that which is left is " all gold . " Take the first of Benning 's regiments , the Second Georgia , whose story may be read only in the reports of regimental commanders in the files . It has come from the villages and farms northeast of Atlanta , the highlands of Georgia . It went out with Semmes , now a major-general but doomed this day to fall in battle . Its second colonel is blind from a shell that exploded in front of his eyes as he went against a battery . It lost its commanding officer in nearly every one of its many battles , and twice every field officer in the regiment was either killed or wounded . And the men are of the same heroic type . Their report of casualties is always very simple ? " killed , " and " wounded " ; you will search the records in vain for a report of " missing . " Here is what 271 men of the Second did at Golding 's Farm in one of the Seven-Days fights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about half or three-quarters of an hour against overwhelming numbers , said to have been nine regiments of the enemy . When the fight ceased , I had but two men that were able to fire their pieces . All were either killed , wounded , or unable to fire , not being able to load their pieces . Others were out of ammunition . A few , I am told , that were not hurt went off with the wounded men . Four days later the remnant charged a battery on Malvern Hill and lost 81 more . Two months after that , the Second and the Twentieth Georgia ( only 403 men in all ) played Horatius at the Bridge and repulsed Burnside 's army corps five times in succession at the Antietam bridge defenders , it is amusing to read the reports of the brigadiers and colonels who explain why they were so long in getting over a bridge which they had been ordered to cross in a hurry . and , when you know the number of the This is a fair sample of Longstreet 's corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Peach Orchard and up Little Round Top this afternoon ? and may God give stout hearts to the men in Blue who must meet that fierce , bitter charge ! Two thirds of the day is gone . Midafternoon has come and Longstreet 's batteries begin to roar , while Hood impatiently watches the dust of a column coming down the road . It is Law 's Brigade of Alabamians , and he can not charge without them . Twenty - seven miles they have covered this hot July day , and now , without food or rest , they must go charging into one of the hottest fights of the war ? an experience without many parallels . But now that you remember what they did when worn out , you wonder what they might have done if they had been rested . When Sickles 's men had glorified their corps at the Peach Orchard and begun to drift back across the wheatfield , Hancock from a distance saw disaster writ large . BUT if that gray line could only be held back until he could form a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Trostle house was Bigelow 's Ninth Massachusetts Battery ? and if the memory of Captain Bigelow is not this day honored up Boston way , something is wrong with Massachusetts corpuscles . Bigelow received orders to hold Longstreet at all hazards ; grimly he loaded his six guns with double charges of canister ( canister bursts at the muzzle and scatters bullets by the quart ) and began to tear ghastly holes in the advancing ranks . But on they came , and still Bigelow fought his guns until a Mississippi regiment came over the smoking muzzles . Bigelow fell wounded on the field , where a fourth of his men already lay , and four of his six guns were captured . Somewhere in the melee of that cruel afternoon came an accident that shows how chivalry crops out even on a hot battlefield . Cannoneers were struggling like demons to get their guns out of danger , when something happened to a caisson . Before it could be extricated , Longstreet 's men were only a few paces distant and a row of muskets was pointed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inviting , he whipped up his horses ; then , instead of firing , an officer called , " Do n't shoot , " and the daring artilleryman took his caisson off the field . And there was bright particular glory on that field for Minnesota also ? glory equal to that of Bigelow 's . Hancock himself sent the First Minnesota as a second sacrifice to stern the tide , and in a few minutes the regiment had suffered the highest mortality of the whole war ? 73 killed or mortally wounded and 140 others wounded , out of a total of 262 . But Bigelow and Minnesota had saved the day . While all this was going on in the open , Georgia and Texas had gone promptly forward to homestead Little Round Top . Just west of the summit was a chasm known as " the Devil 's Den , " defend mainly by Maine and Indiana ; worse yet , by a battery loading with canister Up the rocky slope came that brigade of Benning 's , to whom charging a battery was now work as familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the fallen lay in heaps . But here the men of Georgia won the only victory in the vicinity of Round Top , for they drove back the infantry , captured the battery and held the " Den " until the next day when they were ordered back into line with the other brigades . This had mercifully given them time to send all their wounded back to the rear . While Georgia was sweeping the " Devit 's Den , " Texas made a savage run for Little Round Top and engaged in some of the most desperate hand-to-hand fight ing of all . One of these regiments ( the First Texas ) had fought at Antietam until 82 per cent . of its men were down -- which gives you their caliber . Twice they had all most won , but they were at last driven back with the bayonet , leaving Georgia in the " Den . " Little Round Top had been saved ? but not by the sagacity of a great strategist . It was through the quick action of an engineer officer ( Genera ! Warren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility of detaching regiments from other positions , and rushed them to the point of danger . As dark was falling , there was another tight far over on the Gettysburg side , and the Confederates captured the Union works on Culp 's Hill . But all that matters little now , for the victors were driven out the next day . What matters most is that Lee has listened to all that Longstreet has on his mind , and declines to change his order for a general assault tomorrow . The Third Day THE great hour of Gettysburg is at hand -- -the hour of the evening sacrifice . The cannoneers on Seminary Ridge are grouped behind a hundred massed guns , facing another hundred on Cemetery Ridge , a mile distant . Pickett , his long black hair falling about his shoulders , rides up to Lee and reports that his division is ready . Longstreet also is there , moody and silent , but inwardly rebellious . An order from Alexander , chief of artillery , sends the cannoneers to their posts behind the cruel engines of death . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Artillery , and the work of hell begins with solid shot and shell on both sides . For two long hours the overture continues in a deafening roar --  " the heaviest cannonading ever heard on the American continent . " The fire of neither side does any serious harm to the sheltered infantry , but the shells scatter death and destruction among the batteries , where the sound of exploding caissons alone drowns the pitiful neighing of wounded horses . At " the Bloody Angle " where Pickett 's blow is to fall heaviest , here is what is happen : Lieutenant Cushing , of Battery A , Fourth U. S. Artillery , challenged the admiration of all who saw him . Three of his limbers were changed with the caisson limbers under fire Several wheels were shot off his guns and  | replaced , till at last -- severely wounded himself , his officers all killed or wounded , and with but cannoneers enough to man a section -- he pushed his gun to the fence , and was killed while serving his last canister into the ranks of the approaching enemy . Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done their worst . About three o'clock Alexander 's guns began to run out of ammunition -- a fact which has inferred by Hancock when that officer found that his wound had been made by a tenpenny nail . The fire of the Union batteries slackened under orders to reserve ammunition for the assault , and Alexander sent Pickett the message to come on . PICKETT took it to his corps commander , and Longstreet read it in silence , for the cannonade had not destroyed the dangerous batteries . " I shall lead my division forward , sir , " said Pickett . Longstreet had no heart to speak the word ; he silently bowed his head , and the leader of the forlorn hope rode back to his men . ( Longstreet , reporting to Lee at the close of the battle , says : " The order for this attack , which I could not favor under better auspices , would have been revoked had I felt that I had that privilege . " ) There was one touch of humanity in the parting between Pickett and " Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . It humanizes the hero of  | that daring charge to know that he was much in love . As Pickett turned to go , he placed in Longstreet 's hands a letter addressed to a brown-eyed Virginia girl who yet lives . And this was the postscript which he had written in the brief interval between the cannonade and the charge : Now . my darling . I go ; but remember always that I love you with all my heart and soul , with every fiber of my being ; that now and forever I am yours ? yours , my beloved . It is almost three o'clock . My soul reaches out to yours ? my prayers . Now the smoke of Alexander 's guns lifts like a great curtain , and discloses to he eyes of the whole Army of the Potomac the sublimest spectacle of the Civil War . Pickett 's fifteen Virginia regiments are moving forward in perfect alignment across the field of death , their brigade commanders riding in front as if on parade . The double line of battle is more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remnants of Archer 's Brigade and of Pettigrew 's North Carolinians ? the men who drove in the Iron Brigade and Stone 's Bucktails on the first day . And how pitifully cruel it was ! The long gray line had to cover almost a mile of open ground before it could use its guns , but it was within the range of the replenished Union batteries from the start . The Union gunners begin on it with solid shot ; as the silent line draws nearer , they change to bursting shell and shrapnel . The Virginians fall like sheaves before the sickle , but the ranks silently close . About midway the line is halted and dressed under fire . Then it moves slowly forward in the face of a storm of canister that literally mows great sections to the ground . But the shattered brigades preserve their alignment , oblique to the left , and sweep against the stone wall from which now come the cruel volleys of the infantry . The stout-hearted Webb saw that the charging line would hit his brigade of Pennsylvanians . Using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posted a line of slightly wounded in the rear with instructions to turn back or shoot any man who left the colors . That was the kind of man Webb was . If there had ever been a moment when the attack had the slightest chance to succeed , that chance was swept away by the double-shotted guns before ever the first line of infantry was reached . When Pickett 's men finally struck Webb 's at the stone fence , the fine division had melted down to fifteen little groups of men , almost without officers ? and Pettigrew and Archer on the left had fared worse in an enfilading fire . History has been kind to Pickett , but not sufficient credit has been given to the North Carolinians who went into this avalanche of hell with him . Their heroism may be guessed from this pathetic report of the Twenty-sixth : On July 1st we went in with over 800 men in the regiment . There came out but 216 unhurt . Yesterday they were engaged again and now have only about 80 men for duty . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors ; yesterday they were lost . . Captain Albright is the only captain left in the regiment unhurt , and commands the regiment . The high-water mark of the charge was reached by Armistead 's brigade of Virginians . With his cap upon the point of his sword to guide his men , like the Helmet of Navarre , he pressed far beyond the fence , rushed the batteries , and fell dying beside the guys that he had taken . So desperate was the fighting here that twenty Confederate flags were captured within a space not a hundred yards square . Pickett 's division lost 2,888 men killed and wounded , of whom 1,191 were from Armistead 's brigade alone . The death which spared not his three brigadiers passed over the conspicuous leader with his long black hair , and the voice that had sent the men across the field of blood now gave the command to fall back . And just at that hour . far away to the southward , Grant and Pemberton were standing together under a tree , arranging the details of the surrender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great charge , that of the greatest human interest is the latest ? his letter to the Virginia girl who later became his wife : You never saw anything like it . They moved across that field of death as a bat- talion marches forward in line of battle upon drill , each commander in front of his com -- mand , leading and cheering on his men . Two lines of the enemy 's infantry were driven back ; two lines of guns were taken ? and no support came . . Ah , if I had only had my other two brigades a different story would have been flashed to the world . . .. Seven of my colonels were killed and one was mortally wounded . Nine of my lieutenant-colonels were wounded and three lieutenant-colonels were killed . Only one field officer of my whole command , Colonel Cabell , was unhurt , and the loss of my company officers was in proportion . AS THE tumult and the shouting die , the eye turns away from Pickett and the bloody field and seeks the Chieftain who has lost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " Light Horse Harry " Lee has seen the hopes of the Southland perish . With uncovered head he rides forward to meet Pickett , who comes slowly up the slope with the pitiful remnants of his broken legion , the tears washing the grime of battle from his cheeks . Lee 's face is calm and gives no hint of the emotions within his breast . " It was all my fault , " he says . " Now help me to save that which remains . " At midnight a cavalry officer in charge of the rough wagons that were gathering up the mangled men waited at the General 's tent . At last the gray outline of " Traveler " appeared in the dim moonlight , and Lee wearily dismounted . " This has been a sad day , General ! " he said and then leaned against his horse in utter exhaustion , seemingly unmindful of the other 's presence . " You are much fatigued , General , " said the cavalry officer . " Oh , it 's too bad ! It 's too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last command of the day ? and it concerned the wounded men who had fought in vain and whose moans were the Miserere of the Lost Cause . The officer went to his harrowing task , and " Traveler " was led away by an orderly . Then the Captain of the Confederacy , with his soul exceeding sorrowful , drew back the flaps of his tent and entered the valley of his Gethsemane alone . " And he went forward a little , and fell on his face . . . "
