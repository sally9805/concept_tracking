 | " DO N'T worry about me or about the children ! " I heard the voice near me in the crowd and turned to where a woman was bidding her soldier-husband goodbye . Around them stood three children ? boys aged , I should say , about five , seven and twelve years . A mist covered my eyes . It was almost more than I could endure , the farewell of these soldiers to their families . But there was no mist in the eyes of the woman . Rather a light ! " Do n't worry about the children , " she repeated . " I 'll bring them up , and bring them up to fight for their country , too . You ? you think of 1870 ! Remember father in 1870 ! I 'll remember the children ! " Here was a woman 's courage unsurpassed . She was doing her part , and with what a spirit ! I determined to do mine . I would not return to America , as I had planned . For three years I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been my friend . And now I would be its friend . I would offer my services as a nurse . WHEN I spoke to the head surgeon of the American Ambulance Hospital in Neuilly , whom I knew , he said that they were going to take a certain number of " auxiliaries , " as he called them ? women untrained , who were to work under the direction of the trained nurses . " You are sure you want to come ? " he questioned me . " Yes ? sure . " " But you know , as yet , we have no extra beds for the nurses . " " But I have one in my apartment , " I said . - He gave me another searching look , then replied : " Well , I advise you to get that this afternoon . Listen ! " I did . Far in the distance we could hear , faint but unmistakable , the booming of the guns of battle . " The Germans are within fifteen miles of Paris . Tonight , I think , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? if you wish to come ? to come immediately . " I waited for no more . I hastened to my apartment , miles away in another quarter . I packed my suitcase . I called a fiacre . We strapped my cot on the side , together with my few things . We rode thru the gates of Paris ? the gates that were closed that night ! I saw my bed carried up into a medium-sized room in which there were eight other cots , and that was the only furniture . No chairs , no tables , no bureaus , and certainly no mirrors . For weeks I slept in this room with the other eight nurses , using our suitcases as chairs and tables and chests of drawers . Since that time there has been a place fixed in the other part of the building for nurses ' quarters . We even have a bathtub , which was a personal gift from a good friend of the hospital . The nurses who come now do n't appreciate it . But those who are left of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bathe in ? we appreciate it ! " In a little over a week we must be ready for wounded . " The order came from the head nurse standing almost ankle-deep in the debris that covered the floors , for the building had never been used , and shavings and plaster and mortar had to be swept out and mopped up ? and I had to help do it , on my knees . Beds were moved in for the wounded , but no bedding . We had ordered dozens of blankets . But we could n't get them . We expected twenty-five dozen chairs . We got four dozen . We were short of money ; we were short of help ; but we were long on hope . The hospital grew almost in a night to meet the needs of the Great War , but its growing pains were great and many . Still , it proved the stuff of which we were made . On the personnel of the hospital was an American woman whose name is socially prominent in many countries . Associated with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this was the first essay out of a drawing-room atmosphere . And they made good ? most of them . I take off my hat to the American woman whose sense of organization , of bringing order out of chaos , is born in her , or is absorbed from her organizing husband . Finally , in some way or other , we did get ready , and the word went around that we might expect the wounded that night . The moments were tense . They were so tense we were fairly hysterical . Hour passed hour . Finally we heard the sound of the ambulance coming into the grounds . We rushed ? one over the other ? down the stairs to the receiving room . We met the stretcher as it was being brought in . I say the stretcher , for there was only one . Our first patient ! His wound ? There was n't any . Only an attack of heart trouble , due to fear . Now I can laugh about it . But then ? I ca n't tell you the pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last glimmer of that romantic tradition which made me look forward with beating heart to that first moment . But the wounded began to come in hundreds . Many from the Battle of the Marne that had decided the fate of Paris ? from the Field of the Five Thousand Dead . They came with shattered faces ? some with half faces ; with frozen feet dropping off them ; with fractured legs and arms and brains . Oh ! such sights ? such sights ! And not only did I have to look at them ; I had to care for them . Heaped into days I got years of training . Carefully directed by the trained nurse over me , and by the surgeons , I looked after some of these men . I REMEMBER especially one afternoon , two weeks after the hospital opened . The head nurse was in the operating room . I was alone in the ward with ten wounded men ? I with my two weeks ' experience . One was an Irishman , with the humor and grit of the Celt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fractured arm . And he would n't keep covered . " Sister , " he said in his semi-consciousness , " Sister , where be I ? " " In the hospital , " I answered . " Sister ? sure , an ' if I had a wife , what would she say if she could see me now ? " As I looked up to answer , I caught sight of Pierre in the far corner . He was trying to get up . I dropt the blankets of the Irishman and rushed to him . I knew he was in a critical condition , and delirious . In his skull was a hole as big as a dollar from which his brain protruded . He thought he was again on the battleline , and was arising to meet his enemy . As I persuaded him to return to his bed , the door opened . The orderlies brought in an operation case ? a Frenchman , whose jugular vein , lacerated " by a bullet , had been sewed . Was I ready for him ? they asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my joking Irishman . But as I laid his head on the pillow I saw on the  | pillow of Pierre a red spot ? a bright , spreading spot . The cerebral hemorrhage that we had feared had come . I opened the door ? called , signaled for a doctor . I bade one of the convalescents whose arm was in a sling care for the Irishman , while I rushed to Pierre . The door opened again . The nurse came in with a patient whose leg had just been amputated . This was what war nursing meant , and I had been a nurse two weeks ! YET , curiously enough , we had lots of gaiety , due to the wounded . They are seldom deprest . And they ca n't understand the surprize of the visitors to find them gay . Too , they are eternally bored by the usual question : " Do you want to go back to the trenches ? " Most of them do . It was during the first days that I made the acquaintance of the English " Tommy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one can be sad with Tommy in the ward . The first one I had was Sergeant Walker . He came in with his leg off . " Where was it amputated ? " I asked . " Sure ? and in the field , miss , " he answered . " In the field ? " I exclaimed , astonished . " Who did it ? " " I did . " " You ? What do you mean ? Tell me about it ? " " Well , you see , miss , I was ordered to ' old a position with me men . And , sure , while we was a ' olding of it , waitin ' for reinforcements ? for some of us had to be sacrificed if the retreat ' ad to come , and it ' ad to , miss ? along came one of those whizzin ' shells and ' it me in the leg . But I ' ad orders to stick to me post , me and me men , an ' we stuck , until there was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And , sure , miss , as I started , I felt ' ampered in me goin ' . I looked down and there was me leg a hangin ' by a piece of flesh . Well , now , miss , I was never one to be ' ampered . So I outs with me jackknife , and I cuts the piece of flesh and dropped me leg . Then I hobbled along as far as I could , in a dash for safety ? a dash , miss , " he laughed . He had n't bled to death for the simple reason that the stump of his leg had been seared by the heat of the obus . He was awarded the Victoria Cross ? and he could n't understand why ! Few of us got any sleep during the first weeks . I can still see the face of the surgical nurse as she rushed from the operating room on the first floor , which came to be known as the " clean " operating room , to that on the third floor , known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some of the men were so dirty when they arrived ? so covered with gangrene and filth ? that it was not safe to take them to the operating room for fear of infection . So another room without any appliances had to be opened in another part of the building . This building , which is a block long and half a block deep , has no elevator , so the nurse had to carry her bandages and instruments up and down stairs from one room to the other . She deserves a medal . I wonder how many lives she saved . " Where is the thermometer ? " was a frequent cry , for there was only one then . " Why , ward 232 had it last , I think . " I went to 232 . " Thermometer , " I cried . " Just gave it to nurse in 370 . " I rushed up another flight of stairs , " Give me the thermometer quick , " I demanded . " Ca n't ? using it now , " came back the reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the point of the bayonet , " I insisted , and I meant it , too . " I 've got a boy down there with hemorrhage temperature , I think . " I took the thermometer and rushed back to Antoine . He had developed high temperature , as I found by the thermometer . Before I could tell the doctor , the hemorrhage came . There was no way that I knew to stop the blood , for one could n't put a turn-gat on his back where they had taken a bullet from his spine . I had to think fast , I knew . I sat down by him and thrust my hand into that wound ? it was that large ? at the same time sending one of the convalescents for the doctor . I was covered with blood to my elbow ? but we saved Antoine 's life . NOT many died in our hospital because of our superior surgical staff , altho , for the same reason , we got the most severe cases . However , that is a curious thing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other men in the ward ; it affects the whole hospital for days . They do n't get over it . They do n't forget it . " But you 've seen soldiers die and soldiers killed by the hundreds , " I said to one of them who was brooding over the death of the man in the cot next to his . " Yes , I know , " he answered ; " but this is different . " They seem to feel that when they are in action they are not so impotent against death . I could understand when I saw my first " death . " Always I had been spared that . I was afraid of death . " You are to go to the room on the fourth floor ? the isolation room ? there is a man dying with gaseous gangrene . " They were my orders . I said nothing , but as I closed the door of the ward , I had only one impulse . It was to run . Then I thought of the man there alone ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near a window . He opened his eyes as I came in . They were wonderful eyes , brown and soft and questioning ? haunting eyes . But he said no words . For three hours I sat by his side and watched death creep up . They were the longest hours I have ever spent . He opened his eyes again . " Wife , " he murmured , then " Children . " I understood . " Yes , " I answered . " I will write to them . " The door opened . The rector came in . In his hand was the English prayer-book . I stood up . Again the soldier opened his eyes and listened to the beautiful words of the prayer . And as he listened he held out his hand toward mine , reaching out at the end for some touch . It almost overpowered me , that groping at the last for a human touch . I had never seen him before . He had never seen me . But we drew together in that hour , and so we stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and staggered to my room I thought ludicrously enough of a conversation I had heard of two young girls who had come to France to nurse . They had made a great fete of it . Before they left America they gave " tea " to their society friends and sold their party dresses for the benefit of the soldiers . They were coming to be nurses ! To hold officers ' hands and comfort them ! Did they know that this was what it meant ? But I 'm afraid I 'm giving a wrong impression . For it 's not all sad , as I have said . There were always the soldiers to cheer one . Most of our patients were French ? not such French as you know or as I knew . There is a new spirit . The traditional mask of their frivolity has been discarded ? the fiber of their spirits has been uncovered . Mingling with them are Senegalese and Arabs , many of whom can speak little French . One Arab I remember particularly well . He had been wounded in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But gradually he gained confidence in me , and began to talk with the few French words he knew . One day when we were alone he said : " What 's the war all about , nurse ? Is it about a king ? And is the king in Germany or in France ? " He had been a shepherd of the  | hills and knew nothing of worldly things . As simply as I could I tried to tell him , and he seemed satisfied . When I see the fineness and the courage of " my " soldiers I wonder how I could ever have lacked faith in humankind ? in the godliness of the most simple , yes , even sometimes the most evil ? of men who are purifying themselves in this war . " Greater love hath no man than this " kept ringing ever in my ears as they told me that Jean could n't live thruout the night . We knew he had to die , but we could n't speak of it . He had been brought to us three days before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the attacks of the enemy his comrades had been forced slowly to retreat because of their inferior numbers . But Jean stood by his gun . Regularly , unflinchingly , he kept his gun shooting . He was hit in one leg ? but his hands were all right and the gun went on . He was hit in the other leg . Still his hands were all right , and the gun went on . The enemy , hearing , meeting that incessant , regular fire , thought that reinforcements had come , and withdrew . Alone and unaided Jean won that engagement . Jean had been sent to us . All we could do was to make his last hours as comfortable as we could . His wife was sent for . She came and sat by his bedside . The next day the colonel came to pin on his breast the medaille militaire , the highest honor that can be given to a soldier of France . " I want to kiss it first , " whispered Jean . He took it in his hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonel pinned it on his breast . And now they told me Jean was dying . I took some roses which were on my table and went to him . His wife was weeping by his side . " I 've brought a brave man some roses , " I said . " Oh , nurse , I 'm afraid he 's past knowing or caring now , " she answered , sobbing . " Then I give them to you ? the wife of a brave man . " " Yes ? I know . But at what a price ! What a price I have had to pay for it ! " But even as she spoke ? and again when I caught the gleam of the medaille pinned alone on the black curtains of the carriage that bore Jean to his last resting place ? I thought what it would mean to her ; of what it would mean to her children ; of what it would mean to the small village where he lived ? to the children who would gather around it ? this emblem of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American girl ? came to the French wounded ? No , never . For it is by such bravery ? such spirit ? that we catch enough light to rise .
