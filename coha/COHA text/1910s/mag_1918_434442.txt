BOTH Stevenson and Lamb , writing of ' Beggars , ' fall into what I take to be a grave misapprehension . They both write a defense , and constitute themselves advocates . Lamb brilliantly solicits our pity for these pensioners on our bounty ' ; Stevenson , though he characteristically makes himself comrade and brother of his client , and presents the ' humbuggery ' of the accused as a legitimate art , nevertheless thinks himself but too evidently of a higher order , and the better gentleman of the two . Here , and it would seem in spite of himself , are patronage and condescension . I own such an attitude shocks me and makes me apprehensive . Were I superstitious , of a certain creed , I should cross myself to ward off calamity ; or were I a Greek of the ancient times , I should certainly pour a propitiatory libation to Hermes , god of wayfarers , thieves , vagabonds , mend : - cants , and the like . ' Poor wretches , ' indeed ! ' Pensioners , ' they ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occult powers ! They , mind you , needing our advocacy ! I could indeed bear a different testimony . I think I began first to know the power of the poor , and to fall under their sway , when I was certainly not more than six years old . It must have been about then that I was learning to sew . This seems to have been a profession to which I was so temperamentally disinched that my mother , to we , . enthe task , was wont during the performance of it to read to me . While I sat on a hassock at her feet scooping an unwilling perpendicular needle in and out of difficult hems , my mother would read from one of many little chapbooks and children 's tracts , which were kept commonly in a flat wicker darning-basket in her wardrobe ; little paper books held over from her own and her mother 's childhood . They were illustrated with quaint woodcuts , and the covers of them were colored . I was allowed to choose which one was to be read . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I suppose ? I selected a little petunia-colored one , outwardly very pleasing to my fancy . It contained the story and the pictures of a miserable beggar and a haughty and unfeeling little girl . He was in rags and reclined , from feebleness I fancy , on the pavement ; she walked proudly in a full-skirted dress , strapped slippers , and pantalets . She wore a dipping leghorn with streamers . Just over this she carried a most proud parasol , just under it a nose aristocratically , it may even be said unduly , high in the air . I think I need not dwell on the tale , save to say that it was one of the genus known as moral . ' There was only one ending possible to the story ; the triumph of humility , the downfall of pride and prosperity ; swift and awful retribution falling upon her of the leghorn and pantalets . I believe they allowed her in the last picture a pallet of stra7 , a ragged petticoat , bare feet , clasped hands , and a prayerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poignant for me by the fact that I possessed a parasol of pink pinked silk , ' which was held on Sundays and certain other occasions proudly ? it also ? over a leghorn with streamers which clipped back and front exactly as did the little girl 's in the story . But never , never , ? once I had made the acquaintance of that story , ? was my nose carried haughtily under it when by chance I sighted one of that race so numerous and so ancient , so well known and so little known to us all . From that day I began to know the power of the poor . I can remember delectable candies that I did not buy , delicious soft cocoanut sticks that I never tasted , joys that I relinquished , hopes that I deferred , for the questionable but tyrannous comfort of a penny in an alien tin cup , and the inevitable ' God bless you , little lady ! ' which , remembering her of the leghorn and pantalets , I knew to be of necessity more desirable than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man there in my home town , whom I remember very keenly . He used to go up and down , he and his dog , in front of the only caravansary the place boasted , ? the Hotel Latonia , ? tap-tap , tap-tapping . He had the peculiar stiff hesitating walk of the blind , the strange expectant upward tilt of the face . He wore across his shoulder a strap on which was fastened a little tin cup . I used to see the drummers and leisurely men of a certain order , their chairs tilted back against the hotel wall , their heels in the chair-rungs , their hats on the back of their heads , their thumbs in their arm-holes , their cigars tilted indifferently to heaven , and they even cracking their jokes andslapping their knees and roaring with laughter , or perhaps yawning , perfectly unaware of the blind man , it seemed , while he passed by slowly , tap-tap , tap . tapping . But it was never thus with me . His cane tapped , not only on the pavement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , had you put your car there . It may have seemed that his eyes were turned to the sky . That was but a kind of physical delusion . I knew better . In some occult way they were searching me out and finding me . I can give you no idea of the command of the thing . Perhaps I have no need to . YOur own childhood ? it is not improbable ? may have been under a similar dominion . If I thought to experiment and withhold my penny , I might escape the blind man for a while ; I might elude him , for instance , while the other members of the family and the guests in that old home of my childhood were gay and talkative at the supper table ; or afterward , when laughter and song drowned the lesser sounds ; or while I stood safe in the loved shelter of my father 's arm , listening to conversations I enjoyed , even though I could not understand them ; or while , in the more intimate evenings , he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , and , his fingers rising and falling with magic and precision on the joined wood and ivory , played Mary of Argyle ' until I too heard the mavis singing . But later , later , when I lay alone in my bed in the nursery in the moonlight , or , if it were winter , in the waning firelight and the creeping shadows , then , then there came up the stairs and through the rooms the sound of the blind man 's cane , tap-tap , tap-tapping . He had come for his penny . And the next time I saw him , with a chastened spirit and a sense of escape , I gave him two . // or they had been all but carried off wholesale by measles . Once all nine , as I remember it , were poisoned en gros by Sunday-school-picnic ice-cream , which left the children of others untouched . Only myths were comparable . Niobe alone , and she not altogether successfully , could have matched calamities with him . By and by Time itself , I think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she was , must have come to think the arrows of outrageous fortune were falling far too thick for likelihood , even on so shining a mark as Musgrove . She came from interviews with him with a kind of gentle weariness . But Musgrove , I am very sure , had an eye for the drama . He knew his exits and his entrances , and I have reason to believe no shade of feeling in my mother 's face was lost upon him . He came one day to say good-bye ; his shabbiness heightened , but brightened also , by a red cravat . It was safe now , no doubt , to allow himself this gayety . He knew that my mother would be glad to hear that , through the kindness of some one nearly as kind as herself , he had been able to obtain a position in a large city . He lacked but the money to move . After that ? prosperity , . ' ould be his . My mother did not deny him his chance , Musgrove ? himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not without a certain advantage and privilege for her . So he made his fine bow , and he and his fine marquis manners were gone . I think my mother must have missed him . I know I did . The other pensioners came as regularly as ever ? the gypsy with her grimy laces ; the Jew with his tins and soap ; rheumatic darkies by the dozen , frankly empty-handed ; the little girl with the thin legs and with the black shawl pinned over her 158 ADVENTURES head and draped down over the shy and empty basket on her arm ; and the old German inventor who always brought the tragedy of old and outworn hopes along with some new invention ; or , at infrequent intervals , for a touch of color , there came an Italian organ-grinder , and ? if the gods were good ? a monkey . But there were times when I would have exchanged them all to see Musgrove again , with his fine promethean show of endurance , his incomparable assortment of unthinkable calamities . Another , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a wholly different type . He had not the old free manner of Musgrove , yet he was strangely appealing , too . He wore a beard and was stooped and spent and submissive , a man broken by fate . He did not complain . He did not wait rather grandly by the hall clock as Musgrove had clone ; no , but in the kitchen , about breakfast-time , awaiting the cook 's not always cordial pleasure . In spite of my mother 's sympathy , ? which should certainly have made amends for any lack of it in the cook , ? he had a way of slipping in and out with a little shrinking movement of his body , like the hound that does the same to escape a blow . One would have said that body and soul flinched . He limped stiffly , and seemed always to have come a little dazed from far countries . My mother took even a very keen interest in him . This man was more difficult to reach , but by that very token seemed no doubt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your credulity . His very reticence was moving and hard to endure ; the death of nine or seven children would have been less sad . He kept coming for quite a long time . Then the day dawned ? a day quite like any other , I suppose , though it should have been dark with IN INDIGENCE cloudy portent ? when , by some slight misstep , some trifling but old reference on his part when his mind was off its guard , my mother discovered as by a sudden lightning flash that this was Musgrove . I have known some dramatic moments in my life , but I would not put this low on the list . He seemed to know for an intense arrested instant that he had spoken a false line , that he had for a miserable moment forgotten his part . He staggered into it again with what I know now was fine courage , and managed in perfect character to get away . I can still see him as he departed , bent and submissive ( having most meekly thanked my mother ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the falling leaves of the grape-arbor , in the autumn sunshine , the shadows of the stripped vines making a strange and moving pattern on his old coat as he went ; nor have I failed to see him in all the years since , thus departing , ? inevitably , irretrievably , ? and have found my heart going many a time along with him . My mother , and I with my hand in hers , went back into the quiet comfortable rooms of that old house . But if you suppose we went in any spirit of ascendency or righteous indignation , or justification , you are indeed mistaken . To be in the right is such an easy , such a pleasant thing ; what is difficult and must be tragically difficult to endure is to be artistically , tragically in the wrong . I think it likely that my mother remembered Musgrove , as I have done , through all the years , a little as a survivor might remember one who had gone down before his eyes . It is thus , you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues to sway others with his strange powers , as it is fitting , no doubt , that one of his rare genius should do . rlt Besides those that I have mentioned , there were two especially of that ancient race whose fortunes were bound in with my early memories . It was upon a day when I was a little more than fourteen that I came to know them . I was alone at home , save for the maids in the house , and was reading at my ease , as I loved to do , in that old verandah that fronted the south . I remember well that the book I read was Rasselas , or The Happy Valley . The verandah was deep and long . Beside it ran a brick pavement , delightful in color and texture . Over this , joining the verandah , there curved a latticed grape-arbor of most gracious lines , on which grew , in lovely profusion , a wisteria , a catawba grape vine , moonflower , and traveler's-joy . When the wisteria , like a spendthrift , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but green leaves in its treasury , then the grape bloom lifted its fragrance ; and when this was spent , the traveler 's joy , as though it had foreseen and saved for the event , flung forth its treasure ; and when at last its every petal had fallen and nothing more remained , ? for the moonflower had its own prejudice , persistently refused the demands of the sun , and would open its riches only to the moon and the night moths , ? then the early autumn sun , feeling through the thinning leaves , hardly expectant , would come upon that best treasure of all , stored long , against this time , in the reddening clusters of the grapes . All these things lent I can not say what charm inexhaustible to that old verandah , and made it a place of abiding romance and delight . The pattern of the sunshine and of the moonlight as they fell through the lattice and the leaves , on the floor of it , are things that still haunt my memory with the sense of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it were , of the lavish inexhaustible liberality of life itself . There , secure against interruption , I read and pondered , with the imaginative ponderings of fourteen , the strange longings of that Prince who should have been so content in the Happy Valley . As I read , I was aware of a strange intrusion : a bent form in baggy trousers and rusty coat stooped under the weight of an old and worn harp ; behind him , bent also , but by no visible burden , an old man with a violin entered the gateway of the arbor . They came very slowly and deliberately , yet without pause or uncertainty . They did not introduce themselves , being , I knew instantly , quite above such plebeian need . They asked no permission , nor solicited any tolerance . They spoke not a word . It was as if they had long outgrown the need of such earthly trivialities . He of the rusty coat and baggy trousers , having taken a slow look at the place around , ? as though to establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harp slip from his shoulders to the brick pavement , adjusted it there very deliberately , and proceeded to pluck one or two of its strings with testing fingers , still looking around carefully all the while ; then he adjusted his camp-stool , seated himself , pulled the worn , yet delicate and feminine , instrument toward him , so that her body lay against his shoulder , and put his hands in position to play . The old violin , more lordly , made no concession whatever to harmony ; he tuned or touched not a string , but with a really kingly gesture put his instrument in the worn hollow of his shoulder , laid his head and cheek over against it , as though lending his whole soul to listen , raised the bow , held it for an immortal instant over the strings , and then drew out a long preliminary note ? on , on , on , to the very quivering tip of the bow . My education had not been neglected as to music . There had always been much of it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violin and piano spoke often , and my home town was near a great musical centre , where , young as I was , I had heard the best that was to be heard . Had I been in a critical mood , I should have noted how badly the long-drawn note was drawn ; I can hear still how excruciating it was , how horribly it squawked ; but rendered solemn , as I was , by the strangeness of their appearance and their presence , and dimly , dimly aware of their immortal powers , it thrilled me more than I remember those of Sarasate or Ysaye to have done . The long note at an end , without so much as a consultation of the eyes , they then began . With never a word , only with thrilling tones horribly off the key , the violin spoke , say rather wrung its hands and wailed , Oh , do n't you remember ' ? ( Oh , yes ; I remember ! ' throbbed and sobbed the harp ) ? ' Sweet Alice , Ben Bolt ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been the ' slab of granite so gray , ' varying all the while from one half to one tone off the key , the old violin lending his ear as attentively all the while to the voice of his instrument as if she spoke with the tongues of angels ; his dim veiled eyes fixed on incalculable distances , like those of an eagle in captivity . The old harp , on the contrary , kept his eyes lowered stubbornly on the vibrating strings ; and the harp as he smote , quivered like some human thing struck upon its remembering heart . From the painfully reminiscent song they leaped without pause into that sec ond most wailful melody in the world , ? ' Ah , I have sighed to rest me , Deep in the quiet grave , ' and played that on to the end also . But though to the outward eye these visitors played upon the harp and violin , how much more indeed did they play upon me ! Young , and sensitive and as yet unsounded , how , with dim compelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me emotions I had never known ! Old and worn and bowed with life , and weather-beaten of the world , they played there in the mottled sunlight of that romantic arbor , as might Ulysses have stood mistaken and unhonored by those who had but heard of Troy . There was to me something suddenly overwhelming in the situation . Oh , who was I , to enjoy so much , in such security ; to feast upon plenty , and to know the generous liberality of life , while these , doomed to the duress of the gods , went through the world , day after day , half-starved , playing miserable memorable music fearfully off the key ! Perhaps I was intense ; certainly I was young ; and as certainly I had all the eager vivid imagination of youth . Moreover , this was , it should not be overlooked , my very first adventure , all my own , with the poor ; my first piece of entirely independent service to those mysterious powers . Meanwhile , the divinities in disguise played on ? a wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rollicking measure and infinitely more sad for that than the sighs of Trovatore , ' or than sweet Alice under the stone . Bent they seemed on sounding every stop . You may think they were but a grimy pair , dull and squalid ; probably embittered . I can only tell you that they invoked for me that day , as with the mournful powers of the Sybil of Cumw , love and life and death , and joy irrevocable , and memory ? these they called up to pass before me , and bade them as they went , for one summoning moment , to reveal their faces to me . Presently , I do not know with what dark thoughts , these two would have departed , but I remembered and begged them to stay . I flew upstairs and found my purse , and emptied it , and gave them what it held . They took it without thanks , merely as lawful tribute exacted . Again they would have departed , but I begged them still to remain . Should this ancient Zeus and Hermes be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house with a beating heart . I found bread and milk and meat . I brought these and set them out for them , and drew chairs for them . All this , too , they took for granted , with some shrewd glances at me ; they shuffled their feet about under the table , bent low to their plates like hungry men , and shoveled their food into their mouths dexterously with their knives , the better , no doubt , to disguise their divinity . While they ate , I went , with a heart troubled yet high , and gathered for them grapes that hung immortally lovely in the sun . These too they ate , with a more manifest pleasure , cleaning the bunches down to the stems ; and when they had made away with all they could , slipped the remaining clusters in their pockets against a less hospitable occasion . I remember then that they went and left me standing there in a world of dreams and speculation and adventure . They had gone as they had come ; but me they left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my young days swung and closed mysteriously . For me the channels of life were permanently deepened . With them had departed my complacent , inexperienced attitude of mind ; with them had fared forth the care-free child that I had been . This adventure all my own , con- ducted in my own manner , had initiated me into vast possibilities , the more impressive because but dimly seen . On me had depended for a little while these two of God knows what ancient descent . I too had begun to know and taste life . I too would begin to count my memories . Oh , strange new world ! And with strange people in it ! On this world , enter , upper left stage , Leila the maid . 0 Miss Laura , honey , what you bin ' doin ' ? Dey ai n't , nothin ' but no-'count beggars , chile . Do n't you know dey mought ' a ' come indo 's and car . rued MT all de silver ? Dat 's just de kind would steal fun you when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' now dey ai n't got some o ' de silver in dey pockets ! ' And she took savage stock of what lay on the table . O Leila , ingenuous mind ! Dearly as I loved her , how little she knew ! , How far she was from understanding the habits and predilections of the gods ! Would they trouble , do you think , to take a silver knife or fork , who can take away the priceless riches of childhood with them ? Would they pause to purloin a mere petty silver spoon , who can carry off an entire golden period of your existence , and leave you with the leaden questions and dull philosophy and heavy responsibility of older years ? I should have asked their names , that I might set these in my prayers , but I had not had presence of mind enough to do that ; so , that night , while I knelt by my bed , alone in the moonlight , a very devout little girl , there stood there , shadowy in the shadows , and among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord 's blessing , the old Harp and Violin ; while , with my head buried passionately in my hands , I begged Providence to have an especial care of these new friends of my heart , to bless them , to let its face shine upon them , and to give them peace . Musical beggars ! I have seen them often since , in one guise or another . Sometimes they trumpet on the trombone or cornet , or blow fearful blasts upon the French horn ; I have known them to finesse upon the flute or flageolet . These differences are but inconsiderable . Always I find them equally mighty . I have thought sometimes to get past them with giving them only a great deal more than I could afford . Useless frugality ! futile economy ! For still they will be laying ghostly hands upon you ; still will they be exacting a heavier tribute and demanding that gold and silver of the soul which , as Plato is so well aware , is how infinitely more precious . These are people of power , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you like , and look upon them as the downtrodden and the dregs of existence . I am indeed not so hardy . I have read a different fate in their groups and constellations . IV There were other poor whose influence was potent in my childhood , but I pass them by to note but one more , of a curiously strong type , who crossed my path when I might have been about sixteen . She was a Salvation Army Major , ? Major Lobley , ? and she had at her heels an army of poor wretches , ' flood-sufferers . ' That great river on which my home town was situate had risen and overflowed its banks , and had spread devastation . As it happened , my mother had standing idle at that time three or four small houses . Into these a large and variegated band of flood sufferers ' was assisted to move . They came , poor things , bringing their lares and penates . One , whom I take to have been an aristocrat among them , led a mule . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dark and variegated landscape , came Major Lobleyand the drum . It would make a better recital , I know , if I said that she was beating it ? but I am resolved to tell of things only as I remember them . The drum , however , even though silent , was to the eye sufficiently triumphant and sounding . My acquaintance with Major Lob-ley began the morning after her installation . We had already , for the comfort of her clan , parted with all the available covers we could spare . She came seeking more . The maid brought me her name . I went into the parlor to receive her and to learn her errand . I take the liberty of reminding you that I was young and proud , with a traditional training and conventional pride . In that curtained and rather sombre room , there sat Major Lobley , like a brilliant bit of sunshine . Before I knew what she was about , she was on her feet , had hold of both my hands , had kissed me on both cheeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a quick pleased gesture seen oftener on the stage than off it , ? and was saying dazzlingly , ' Sister ! Are you saved ? ' They tell me that even the bravest at the Marne were demoralized by the use of poisonous gases and other methods of warfare unknown , even undreamed of , by them ; and a like panic is said to have seized the Germans at first sight of the British armored monsters which ploughed over the ground disdainful of every obstacle , taking their own tracks with them . Major Lobley attacked me in a fashion I had never before even dreamed of . She was carrying her own tracks with her . None of my own aforethought invulnerable defenses were of the least use . She had thrown down and traversed the most ancient barriers . She had attacked me in the very intrenchments of my oldest traditions . Where were dignity , convention , pride of place , custom of behavior , and other supposedly impregnable defenses ? Where were distinctions of class , fortifications of good taste , intrenchments of haughtiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barbed-wire entanglements ? I tell you , they were as though they were not ! This glib inquiry about my soul routed me , demoralized me so completely that I do not even remember what I said . I only know that I fled precipitately for safety into the covert of the nearest subject . Was there anything she needed ? And how could I serve her ? At this she was eager . Well , I 'll tell you ! We need another comfort . Darius needs a comfort for his mule . Darius is a good man and his soul is saved . Now could n't you lend another comfort to the Lord ? ' Yes , ' said I , in what now seems to me a kind of hypnotized state . ' I think I can find another for you . ' And I went myself and took it from my bed . She received it with hallelujahs and went away beaming , assuring me as she went , and as on the authority of an ambassador , that I would certainly have my reward . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was the weak and routed one . I know that this gypsy from nowhere , with her lack of advantages and her Cinderella training among the ashes and dregs of life , had me at an astonishing disadvantage . I know that , while I stood by , in my futile pride , she went off unaccountably , in a spangled coach , as it were , carrying with her salvation and all the satisfaction in the world , happily possessed of the bed-covers without which I was to sleep somewhat chilly that night . But I think it due to myself to say that this weakness on my part was not single . For weeks , months ? as long as she stayed in the neighborhood ? Major Lobley swayed people as by a spell . One would have sworn her drum- stick was a wand . In theory , and out of her presence , we younger ones declared her presuming and impossible , but were reduced to serve her whenever she appeared . My mother and my elder sister , who were experienced and better judges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily help . Pans of biscuit , pots of soup , drifted in that northwesterly direction as by some gulf stream of sympathy which you might speculate and argue about all you liked , but whose course remained mystical and unchanged . One point I must not fail to mention . I had worried somewhat concerning Darius 's mule . There was , I knew , no shelter for him save a tiny woodshed just about half his size . I pictured him standing there with only his forequarters or hindquarters sheltered , and the rest of him the sport of the elements and the biting weather . Needless anxiety ; futile concern ! I might have read a different fate for him in Orion and Pleiades ! Such anxiety comes of thinking too meanly of life . Darius had a better opinion of it , and it may be with better cause . Perhaps he argued that a power that was able to save his soul was perfectly well able to look after his mule ; and rendered expectant by this belief , Darius 's eyes saw what my less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comfortable kitchen of the little house , with its sunshine and its neat wainscoting , made an ideal abiding-place for his friend . Here , therefore , positively benefiting by misfortune and like an animal in a fairy tale , the mule of Darius abode , and no doubt more comfortably than ever in his life before ; and if his meals remained meagre , he was enabled to eke them out with a generous attention to the wainscoting . You see ! What can be said of a people like that , able to turn the most unlikely things to strange and immediate uses , for all the world as the fairy godmother did the pumpkin and the mice ! Here is , I am persuaded , something ancient and inherited , and acquired not in Major Lobley 's brief span ; something , rather , dating back to gypsy centuries , God knows how many : eons ago ? something that had triumphed and ruled on countless occasions before now ; some freedom , some innate self-approval ; some linking , it would almost seem , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have it as you will , the finer appearance still clings to the improvident . They give you color and incident without your asking ; they scatter romance and wonder with largesse , as kings . As mere memorable characters , were not the old blind man and Musgrove and Major Lobby worth the money and the anxiety they cost us ? And who will contend that Darius 's tradition is not to be valued above a mere wainscoting and the cost of a few repairs ? I have long believed that 2Esop needs rewriting in many instances , and very especially in that of ' The Grasshopper and the Ant . ' What should be told ? since lEsop 's creatures are intended to exemplify human behaviors and draw human morals ? is how the Grasshopper spent the winter with the Ant , and ate up all the Ant 's preserves and marmalades , and fiddled nightly and gayly by the Ant 's fire , and managed somehow to make the Ant feel that the privilege had been all her own , to have labored long for the benefit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall from time to time , all through my childhood and girlhood , that I and mine made a kind of festival of a like circumstance , and how gladly we toiled for the benefit of that class which might be said to winter perpetually on our sympathies . I do not allude merely to tableaux , fairs , private theatricals , musicales , and the like , given for the benefit of those who neither sowed nor gathered into barns . I would be afraid to say how many times , from my early years , I was for their sake a spangled fairy , a Queen Elizabeth court dame , an ' Elaine , ' white , pallid , on a barge , dead of unrequited love , a Gainsborough or Romney portrait , or a Huguenot lady parting from her lover , or a demure ' Priscilla , ' or a dejected Mariana , ' or a shaken-kneed reciter of verses , or a trembling performer on the piano . I remember that there was a huge trunk in the old attic at home given over to nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from dragging , wearisome rehearsals , how tired , but happy ! What fun it was to toil and practice and rehearse and labor until your little bones ached for the benefit of ! ' Tor the benefit of ' ! I tell you it is a magic phrase ! I remember my mother coming home again and again ? from some charitable conclave I suppose ? radiant and eager , as she so often was , to announce that we were once more to be permitted to labor in response to its magic . Once , after her attendance on some missionary meeting , it was conveyed to us that we were to be allowed to dress fifty dolls for the benefit of ' as many gregarious little grasshoppers of Senegambia , to the end that their Christmas and our own should be the happier . It had all the air of a fine adventure . It was a fine adventure . I really would not have missed it . Yet unless you have dressed , let us say , thirty dolls , and know that twenty more remain naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even on the most eager fingers . I can still see them all in their pretty and varied dresses , ranged triumphant at last on top of the old square piano , that we might behold the labor of our hands ? their feet straight ahead of them , their eyes fixed , staring but noncommittal , supposedly on Senegambia . It seems to me now a gay , even though at the same time a somewhat futile , thing to have done ; but turn it as you will , the true privilege was ours . We and our forebears , you see , had in perfect innocence laid by a few stores through the generations . We had preserved and retained certain standards and comfortable customs and conveniences of living ; certain traditions too of education and treasures of understanding ; by which token it became our privilege to entertain and provide for those cicada souls who had followed the more romantic profession of fiddling ; and that we might have our privilege to the full , we were graciously permitted to set our preserves , not merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was vouchsafed us to sustain and supply with dolls and other delights the appealing little grasshoppers of Senegambia . Recalling all my childhood and girlhood experience with the poor , I am led by every path of logic to believe that they have some secret power of their own ? some divine right and authority by which they rule , beside which the most ancient dynasties are but tricks of evanescence , and the infallibility of the Pope a mere political exigency . The powers they wield would seem to me unique . Show me a dictatorship , empire , oligarchy , system or suzerainty , seignory or pashawlic , which presides over and possesses anything commensurate with their realm ; which sways and commands anything comparable to their wide dominion ! Will you shoW me any other people outside of the fairy-books who can put the most fearful calamity on like a cloak and doff it at will , who can augment their families to seven or eight children overnight , and reduce them as readily to five or six the following day if it but seem to them advisable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of persuading you that it is a privilege to sleep cold so that . some Darius you never saw or care to see shall , he and his allegorical mule , go better warmed ? Who else , being neither of your kith nor kin , has such power over you that , with a mere bloodshot eye and shiver of the shoulders , they can turn your automobile , your furs , your warmth , and all your pleasant pleasures into Dead Sea apples of discomfort ? Or , did any of your own class , by merely playing ' Ben Bolt , ' raggedly and horribly off the key , under a grape-arbor , exercise so great a power over you that , having given him what you had , you went awed and chastened of all vanity , and set his name in your prayers that night as the Church service does the king ? Are these people of rank who can do this ? Or will you still cling to your aristocracies ? It is likely that I shall be accused of sentimentality . Some will say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but cruel irony . ? If I would speak wisely and not as one of the foolish women , let me live and work among the poor , or better still , he of them . This is the only way fairly to judge them . I am of a like opinion ; and am therefore resolved to ask you to let me speak of a later time , when I myself was poor , and of the wider knowledge of the pow , ers of the poor which that circumstance afforded me . For , in my advantageous days , I was permitted only to serve the poor , the discouraged , the improvident ; later , I was promoted to be , at least in a measure , of their fellowship .
