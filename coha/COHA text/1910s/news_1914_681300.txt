txt Gunda Still In Chains . Gunda 's head is hurt and bleeding , both sides showing Injury . His general physical condition , also , seems to have deteriorated , and though more than two weeks have passed since promises were made in regard to his greater freedom , nothing so far seems accomplished but the easing of his chains . There is no sign as yet of any change in his cage , of new gates , or other arrangement , and his constant nosing of the fastenings of his cage is pitiful . I observe that the chimpanzee has been removed to an adjoining cage and that changes generally are under way in the primates ' house . I do not know , however , to what effect . The Canadian porcupine , noted elsewhere in this morning 's press , was not in evidence at all this afternoon , though other small animals , the agouti and woodchuck , were gnawing their wires as badly as the Canadian porcupine to which attention had been ? called . What has been printed does not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that the press can help .
