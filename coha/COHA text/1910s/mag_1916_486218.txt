Contributions to Biblical and Patristic Literature , entitled " The So-called Egyptian Church Order and Derived Documents , " by Dorn R Hugh Connolly The forbidding task of writing a life of Washington for young people in two hundred pages has been performed by William H Rideing for Macmillan 's " True Stories of Great Americans " series ( 50 cents net ) in an interesting but by no means brilliant way The narrative covers the field of late Colonial and early national affairs in a manner which , considering the limited size of the volume , has made it impossible to study Washington 's per sonality at all A book of more intimate flavor might , since school histories care for the background of Washington 's life fairly well , have been more serviceable . L Frank Tooker has done decidedly better with John Paul Jones , whom , however , he draws with too flattering a pen for strict historical truth . Jones 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea-fighter are well described , and the author is happily confident enough of the maturity of his readers to include several of Jones 's long letters But the man 's faults , whether his uncontrolled love of glory , his occasional cruelty , or the instability which once made him disloyal to America , are glossed over It has been estimated that the average man employs a vocabulary of from three to four thousand words Robert Palfrey Utter , in his " Every-Day Words and Their Uses " ( Harper , $1 25 net ) , lists and explains the correct uses of about a thousand words which the average man abuses From these two statements one would not be justified in an inference that the average man blunders at every third or fourth word , yet it is a safe guess that in a ten-minute conversation he will commit some offence  --  let slip some grammatical or rhetorical toad  --  against which a diligent perusal of Professor Utter 's hook would have forewarned him The average man needs a book of this sort constantly at hand The special merits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one mental acquisition as an essential part of the education of a lady or a gentleman  --  namely , an accurate and refined use of the mother tongue " Phis striking sentence of ex-President Eliot 's Mr. James P Kelley adopts as the motto of his good-humored , vivacious , and somewhat scandalous book , " Workmanship in Words " ( Little , Brown , $1 net ) The good humor of it is perhaps due to a comfortable assurance that " the English language , with all its faults is on the whole the best that man ever spoke ' ' The vivacity is the result of a linguistic conservative 's healthy reaction against the assaults of the historical radicals The scandalous element to which we have referred consists of a large collection of maior and minor stylistic immoralities laid at the doors of such living masters of the written word as Mr Woodrow Wilson , Mr Theodore Roosevelt , Mr W H Taft , Mr A T Hadley , Mr C W Eliot , Mr Thomas Hardy , Mr H.

Indeed , the company is large and fine enough , the historical radicals would say , to escape condemnation by an appeal to the great principle of " good usage . " Mr Kelley , they would say , is a purist , with a strain of the **34;1281;TOOLONG " schoolmarm . " Mr. Kelley is aware that his cases can be used against him . His point is essentially this : What good writers give us is English ; but good writers are occasionally hurried and negligent , therefore , the English that they give us is not always good English There are principles of clearness , ease , and force to which the princes of language should be subject . A construction that is obscure or awkward or weak is condemnable , though it were employed by every English writer from Chaucer to Chesterton William Watson has written an essay of a hundred pages on " Pencraft " ( Lane ; $1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brotherhood of good writers , and will perhaps provoke yawns and witticisms from the younger generation of penmen Time makes paradoxers of the orthodox , the truisms of yesterday are the bold sallies of to-day . And so we listen with attent ear to Mr Watson 's exposition of the thesis that writing is a fine and admirable craft , beyond the manipulative faculty of babes and suckhngs . Old-fashioned people may inquire , Who has said anything to the contrary ' ' Well , Mr Watson has collected a good many signs of popular heresy An American publisher advertises a new author 's work as free from everything connoted by " that now discredited word literary " The critical world sneers at the meticulous workmanship of Tennyson , Dryden languishes in oblivion , while even the bards rhapsodize over the babblings of Blake and the loose effusion of Whitman Literature in prose and verse deserts the ancient high standards of the " scriptive " art , and goes a-whoring after the " loquitive " Men of letters themselves accept the pernicious aesthetics of Browning 's " Andrea del Sarto , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divine is most resident in the unformed , the unfinished , the inarticulate With patience , yet with pain , Mr. Watson remarks that to sneer at Tennyson " for being ' still occupied with his vowel-endings ' is just as foolish as it would be to sneer at an architect for being ' still occupied with his volutes and cornices ' " , He believes with Dante that a mastery of lo bello stile will not in itself disqualify a man for receiving a vision of the celestial rose To assume that the Supreme Power has a preference for transmitting his messages by the tongues of the feeble-minded , and in the style of kitchen-French , is an unhandsome conception of God " Great indeed is a ' profound simplicity of intellect , ' great can be the , power of the childlike mind ; yet I do not know that I am prepared to live in the nursery for the distant and doubtful chance that some apocalypse may there be vouchsafed which is denied to the study and the cloister , the workshop and the fields The adult brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult experience " To any man who can construe quid est quid these words are as apples of gold in pictures of silver " Irrigation Management " ( Appleton , $2 net ) , by Prof Frederick Haynes Newell , of the University of Illinois , is intended primarily for the farmer of irrigated lands and the men whose duty it is to see to the maintenance of irrigating canals and ditches against the many forces operating to destroy them or impair their efficiency Any intelligent reader , however , will find much in the book to attract and hold his attention The irrigation canal must go where it is needed , not where the forces of nature left to themselves would take it , and this means that only eternal vigilance can make sure that it will not break away from the unnatural situation in which It must often be placed At one point the winds are constantly eating away the sand which forms the only available material for its banks , at another ranging cattle may trample the banks down until an overflow begins , or , again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will do thousands of dollars ' worth of damage before it is discovered This means that the successful " canal rider " must be a man of energy and resourcefulness , capable of assuming large responsibilities and discharging them with speed and precision when occasion rises It is a work that naturally appeals to the self-reliant , outdoor-loving type of manhood which American conditions have fostered An immense extension of irrigation in American agriculture is one of the certainties of the future , and this book will doubtless stimulate many young men to fit themselves for service in that work . The " ditch digger " has from ancient times been regarded as being about at the bottom of unskilled labor , but the " canal rider " ranks with the forester in an occupation requiring an independence of judgment , skill , and trustworthiness which must command the respect of all . One may almost surmise that the germ of a new outdoor poetry is wrapped up in the forester and the canal rider , having distinctive flavor in the fact that the author is out-of-doors for a serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The modern book illustrator has his innings once a year At Christmas , at least , working in a picturesque period , he has free scope for decoration and invention in the editions of household classics that are still in fashion as gift-books . Washington Irving 's " Old Christmas " ( Putnam , $2 50 net ) is always a favorite , and this year Frank Dadd , the popular British illustrator , helps perpetuate the flavor and tradition that the late F Hopkinson Smith carried on so consistently on this side of the Atlantic . An attractive edition of Smith 's " In Dickens 's London " ( Scribner , $2 ) is the last product of his prolific pen and pencil F Hopkinson Smith was an indefatigable tourist in the best sense of the word . In this volume the various inns that are rapidly disappearing before the London builder are lovingly depicted , and the record of each pilgrimage of the artist-author reads like the adventure it really was For the suburban and country dweller , Stephen F Hamblin 's " Book of Garden Plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite benefits In addition to the carefully ehosen photographs and brief letter-press , we recommend his lists of various seasonal plants adapted to the needs of community or private gardens , while the accompanying blueprint facsimiles are a novel and useful inclusion in a book of this character . In a little book just published by D Van Nostrand Co ( $2 net ) , Mr Allen Hoar , seeking to give the characteristics and development of " The Submarine Torpedo Boat , " writes for both the layman and the designing constructor . Touching very lightly on the history of earlier inventions , he devotes an interesting chapter to the types in use by the belligerents in the present war , and be gives a condensed account of their exploits It is impossible , he justly contends , to forecast the future of this new weapon without seriously considering the grave problems in construction and propulsion that must be solved at each step , hence the value of the technical chapters , which deal with such ma tters as stability , engines , speed , habitability , radius of action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow in size and powers of destruction is inevitable . Rightly , he holds that Its field of action is limited by the physical endurance of its crew . The discussion of the tactics of the under-water boat , and of the means of resisting its attacks , is worth reading , even if not always convincing A copious index and many illustrations make the reader 's path easy and agreeable The cut on page 90 is especially illuminating , as exhibiting the fearsome complexity of the interior installation and control mechanism of a submarine . With a strong endorsement by P. A. Valle , who himself has written , perhaps , the best of all the many books on golf , there appears anonymously " Golf for Women , " by A Woman Golfer ( Moffat , Yard ; $2 50 net ) . In her preface the author excuses her temerity by the very reasonable plea that a woman understands the particular needs and difficulties of women better than a man can . Certainly this volume is better calculated to assist women who are learning the game , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some serious study , than are the few chapters commonly given to women in books by the masculine experts Adopting Mr Vaile 's method , the author reverses the usual order of procedure , starting with putting , which ( pace Harry Vardon and others ) she thinks can be taught , and continuing through the mashie and mid-iron to the wooden clubs . Her defence of this arrangement is , in our opinion , sound , as in general are the principles of play that she expounds . The style is clear , and the book should serve admirably the purpose for which it was written . An index would have been an advantage The spread of legislation on health insurance over practically all Europe , and especially its enactment in England , where it includes a comprehensive system of State medical care , has inspired much interest in the subject in America . Health-insurance bills were introduced in three States in 1916 , Massachusetts especially giving earnest consideration to one ; bills will be championed in other States this winter by the American Association for Labor Legislation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of such insurance by an ardent believer in it is offered in I. M. Rubinow 's " Standards of Health Insurance " ( Holt ; $1.50 net ) . Most of the content of the book has appeared in articles in the Journal of Political Economy . The author properly avoids statistics , and confines himself to a discussion of the objects to be achieved , the proper scope of health insurance , the financial and administrative organization of various systems , and the manner of distributing the cost among those benefited Mr. Rubinow argues in favor of compelling all wage-earners of certain sorts to take out insurance against sickness ; he believes that a system of health insurance should offer no less than four branches of effective service  --  medical care , sick benefits , maternity benefits , and funeral benefits , he believes that state , employers , and employees should all contribute to the cost ; and he criticises in a fruitful way the administrative workings of the chief European systems , obviously giving the preference to the German as compared with the British . Granting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governmental legislation is generally desirable in some parts of America , the volume is thoughtful and scientific , and should contribute much to intelligent discussion of an important question It is something of an accomplishment in the realm of philosophy that so solid a book as Dr. James Ward 's " Naturalism and Agnosticism " should have reached a fourth edition ( Macmillan ; $3.25 net ) . In order to bring the work into the compass of a single volume the detailed table of contents has been omitted , but the index remains . A few notes have been added , and the preface states that a number of small emendations have been made in the text . " Travels in the American Colonies , " edited under the auspices of the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America by Newton D. Mereness , appears from the press of Macmillan . The collection consists of eighteen journals or letters , of varying length and interest , of which the earliest dates from 1690 and the latest from 1783 The largest number of journals deal with journeys into the Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or French agents sent on missions of one sort or another There are three journals written by adherents of the Moravian sect , and five of miscellaneous character . The most interesting of the journals , at least from the point of view of the general student of colonial history , is that of Lord Adam Gordon , a member of the English Parliament and an officer in the army , who journeyed through the West Indies and the northern colonies at the close of the last French war . The record of his observations and impressions makes a journal of eighty-four pages , and is of considerable value for the student of the beginnings of the Revolution The editor has contributed a brief introduction to each document , furnishing the essential facts , so far as discoverable , of the author , and of the circumstances giving occasion for the document itself . The Carnegie Foundation some years ago embarked upon the laudable work of furnishing an index to the economic material in the reports and Governors ' messages of all the States of the Union Thus far eleven volumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they are now followed by a large manila-bound book of seven hundred pages treating of New Jersey documents The editor , Adelaide R. Hasse , of the New York Public Library , has given a broad interpretation to the term " economic " , the references to localities , in listing the materials , have been made complete , and a valuable innovation is an Index of the names of legislators and of administrators who have in one way or another influenced the development of the economic life of the State .
