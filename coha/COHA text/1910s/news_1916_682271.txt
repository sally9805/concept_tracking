txt Not only a man 's house but his thea.tre is his castle , also his barber shop , restaurant , hotel , or music hall . That is Pie ' plain meaning and scope of the Unanimous opinion of the Court of Appeals in WOOLLCOTT VS . SHUBERT , handed down yesterday and printed elsewhere in this newspaper . He may exclude from his theatre , hotel , restaurant , or barber shop any person upon any ground other than that of race , creed , or color , the prohibition of the statute being limited , in the opinion of the court , to those grounds . The , question now settled arose from the exclusion of the dramatic critic of Tian TIMES from the theatres of the SEDIBEIrrs because his criticism of one of their plays was displeasing to them . The court passes no judgment upon the character of Mr. WOOLLCOTT 'S critical articles ; it does not attempt to determine whether they were , in fact , unjust , unfair , or so objectionable to the SEUBERTS as to justify the exclusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since the court holds that they might exclude him for any reason save that Of race , creed , or color . And , of course , the court had nothing to say about the ' value to the public , and to the theatres  --  above all , to the drama ? of the critic 's work , uninfluenced by fear or favor . Under this interpretation the Civil Rights act of 1895 , as amended in 1913 , stands just where it did before , a null and void enactment . The Federal act , as everybody knows , has long been honored by universal want of observance . Null and void as an enforceable statute , we mean , for , of course , exclusion from theatres or hotels on the avowed ground of race , creed , or color is still punishable . But when any other grounds suffice and constitute a valid defense in law the excluder would be woefully lacking in fertility of invention if he could not devise a reason that would serve his end without incurring the risk of punishment . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is revealed and Its scope strictly limited by the words " race , creed , or color . " Tile act does not abrogate the common law rights enjoyed by thb defendants at the time of the enactment , and their survival does not deprive it of its efficacy for the purposes defined by its terms . Previous decisions of the court give support and authority for this opinion . These decisions followed the old English case of - Wool ) VS . LEADBITTER , highly technical decision , which has been discarded as an authority by the English courts since the passage of the Judicature act , requiring the application of equitable principles . The decision in WOOD VS . LEA.DBITTER having been definitely repudiated by the English courts , it was hoped that ours would not be slow to eradicate the effect of this obsolete decision from the jurisprudence of the State . It is now perfectly lawful for the producers of a play to exclude a critic because they differ with him about its merits .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
