 |p836  AS we look down the long history of dramatic literature we can not help seeing that the successful playwrights may be assorted into different groups . They are all of them , of course , first and foremost playwrights ? that is to say , they all possess the innate and instinctive gift of arousing and of retaining the interest of the playgoers of their own time and of their own country . They are all story-tellers on the stage , because a play needs a plot above all else , if it is to please long and to please many . But the kind of story they will select and the degree of importance they will give to the story itself will depend on their own differing attitudes towards life . Some successful playwrights are poets , essentially dramatic , like Sophocles and Shakespeare , or essentially lyric like Rostand and d'Annunzio . Some are social satirists , like Moliere and Beaumarchais . Some are wits like Sheridan , or humorists like Labiche . Some , like Ibsen , are primarily psychologists creating characters to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are sociologists dealing with the problems of the day . Some are journalists , as Aristophanes was on occasion and as Sardou in his earlier comedies of contemporary Paris . Some are preachers , like Mr. Shaw . And some of them are simply story-tellers , pure and simple , not poets or psychologists or philosophers , not humorists or journalists , but merely concocters of plots , so adroitly put together that the acted narratives amuse us in the playhouse and give us the special pleasure to be found only in the theatre , without providing us with the added delight which we derive from the veracious and significant portrayal of men and women .  |p837  Of these story-tellers of the stage , content to be storytellers only and satisfied to rely on the attraction of a sequence of ingenious situations artfully articulated , Scribe is the chief . He is not a poet ; he is not even a man of letters ; he does not make us think ; he does not deposit in our memories anything worthy of remembrance . All he can do is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the mechanical dexterity of the story he is setting before us by the aid of all the devices of the theatre . He is a story-teller on the stage and nothing else ; but he is one of the indisputable masters of stage story-telling . His stories may be empty , arbitrary , artificial ; but they are sufficient unto themselves . He is successful in achieving all that he is ambitious of attaining ? the entertainment of the spectators by the exhibition of his surpassing skill . It may be admitted that merely as a craftsman he is not more dexterous than certain of the greater dramatists . As sheer machinery nothing of his is better in its kind than the exposition of " Othello " or of " Tartuffe " ; and he never put together a plot more artistically wrought out than those of " Oedipus the King " or of " Ghosts . " But Shakespeare and Moliere , Sophocles and Ibsen , while they reveal themselves as the most accomplished of technicians , are not content to be technicians only ; and the larger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundantly evident that few of us ever pay attention to their marvellous mastery of technique . But Scribe was nothing but a technician ; and it is solely by his mastery of technique that he maintained himself in the theatre for two score years . He was astonishingly fertile ; and his productivity was exhibited in almost every department of the drama ? in farce , in the comedy of anecdote , in opera-comique , in grand opera , and even in librettos for the ballet . He did not lay his scenes always in his native land , whose manners and customs he could not help knowing ; and at one time or another he ventured to manufacture plots supposed to take  |p838  place in almost every habitable country of the globe . The " Bataille de Dames " and " Adrienne Lecouvreur " were stories of France ; but the action of the " Dame Blanche " took place in Scotland , that of " Fra Diavolo " in Italy . that of " La Juive " in Spain , that of " Le Prophete " in Germany , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In one piece , suggested by Fenimore Cooper 's " Lionel Lincoln , " he even ventured to cross the western ocean and to take Boston for his background . Sometimes , as in the case of the Cooper adaptation and of the " Dumb Girl of Portici , " he had to go abroad became the original of the story he was setting on the stage was foreign and could not well be made French . And sometimes , on the other hand , he transported his tale to a far country , to a land other than his own , so that he could attribute to it the manners and the customs and the laws which he needed to enable him to immesh the poppets of his plot in the thrilling situations he had invalid . 8s sid not set out on these travels to capture the local a kaidtie countries he might visit , as Hugo had essayed to " Hernani " and in " Ruy Blas . " Scribe 's local color always sporadic and superficial . Iie went far afield in order to profit by conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions were not necessarily those which really obtained in the foreign parts to which he exiled the personages of his plays ; they were those which he needed to bring about the events he was devising . Therefore the manners and the customs and the laws which we find in many of the stories of Scribe set before us on the stage are not really those of Spain or Italy , of England or Germany , of Africa or America ; they were in fact almost as much Scribe 's own invention as the stories themselves . His frequent departure from the facts of history and of geography were promptly noted by contemporary critics more familiar with foreign lands than he was ; and they accused him of having imagined a country of his own , to  |p839  which they gave his name ? La . Scribie ? Scribia ? a very useful country for a playwright because its social conventions existed solely for the playwright 's convenience , and because they might be modified unceasingly as the exigencies of plot-making demanded . When Andrew Lang first heard of this fabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lyric , which he called " Partant pour la Scribie . " A pleasant land is Scribie , where The light comes mostly from below , And seems a sort of symbol rare Of things at large , and how they go , In rooms where doors are everywhere And cupboards shelter friend and foe . A land of lovers false and gay ; A land where people dread a " curse " ; A land of letters gone astray , Or intercepted , which is worse ; Where weddings false fond maids betray , And all the babes are changed at nurse . Oh , happy land , where things come right , We , of the world where things go ill ; Where lovers love , but do n't unite ; Where no one finds the Missing Will ? Dominion of the heart 's delight , Scribie , we 've loved , and love thee still ! Unfortunately the lyrist who rhymed this delectable description had allowed himself to be deceived by a traveller 's tale rarely to be relied upon . The land for which he has here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is accurately mapped on the atlas of imaginary geography . It is an adjoining territory first explored by Mr. Jerome K. Jerome and explained in his authoritative book of travels , entitled " Stage-Land , Curious Habits and Customs of its Inhabitants . " Among the many citizens of this peculiar  |p840  place whom Mr. Jerome was enterprising enough to interview , were the Stage-Hero and his fit mate , the StageHeroine , the Stage-Villain and the StageAdventuress , the Stage-Detective and the Stage-Lawyer . Mr. Jerome was able to accompany his analysis of the peculiar personalities by an account of the legislation which governs their conduct and which had hitherto been unfamiliar to students of comparative jurisprudence . It appears that in Stage-Land , when a man dies , without leaving a will , then all his property goes to the nearest villain . But , if the deceased has left a will , then and in that case , all his property goes to the person who can get possession of this document . As Mr. Jerome fails to cite any decisions in support of these laws , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge-made . Yet he is frank to inform us that he has not been able to ascertain the fundamental principles of the jurisprudence of Stage-Land , since " fresh acts and clauses and modifications appear to be introduced for each new play " ; and here we discover a condition of things closely resembling that which obtains in Scribia . Yet Stage-Land is not Scribia , although their several populations are apparently descended from the same stock . It is in Stage-Land , rather than in Scribia , that the Missing Will always turns up in the nick of time and that all the babes are changed at nurse . Nor is Scribia identical , as some geographers seem to have believed , with the NoMan's-Land in which dwelt the pale personages of M. Maeterlinck 's earlier plays , a shadowy and mysterious realm where the unsubstantial " Intruder " finds his way invisibly into the household of death and where the " sightless " wander aimlessly and hopelessly . Still less is Scribia to be confounded with two other countries , Utopia and Altruria , about which the gazetteers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is , however , a certain plausibility in the suggestions that Scribia had for  |p841  its capital the city of Weiss-nicht-wo and that it has recently rectified its frontiers by annexing the contiguous principality of Zenda . When Brunetiere was bringing to its logical conclusion his illuminating series of lectures on the evolution of French dramatic literature , he took as the topics for his final talk Scribe and Alfred de Musset , contemporary and unlike ? Scribe the craftsman who was only a craftsman , thinking solely of the theatre and living in it contentedly , and Musset the lyrist , careless of formal structure and regardless of the narrowing limitations of the playhouse . Different as they were in equipment and in aim , both of them were wont to take for the scene of their dissimilar dramas , emptily prosaic in the one case and in the other abundantly poetic , the non-existent country which had been named after the elder of them , and which was a land of fantasy with manners and laws easy to manipulate according to the necessities of the fables they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not call Scribia by its name ; but he did draw the attention of his hearers to the ideal Bavaria of Musset 's " Fantasio , " the Italy of his " Bettine , " the Sicily of his " Carmosine , " and the Hungary of his " Barberine " ? " all Shakespearian lands , if I may so call them , in which characters from fairy tales undergo their adventures in gardens always in bloom and under skies that are eternally blue . " When Brunetiere ventured to suggest that the indeterminate backgrounds of Musset 's ironic imaginations might be called Shakespearian , he was only recognizing the obvious fact that the French lyrist , alone among modern dramatists , had chosen to follow in the footsteps of the author of " As You Like It " and of " Twelfth Night . " From Shakespeare Musset borrowed the commingling of realistic and prosaic characters with characters poetic and romanticized . He arbitrarily banished the persons who people his airy fantasies to a far and foreign land chiefly that he might let them live in an atmosphere of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rigors of commonplace existence in contemporary Paris . So Shakespeare , in order that an unknown distance from London might lend enchantment to the view , had chosen to domicile the grave and the gay characters of his romantic comedies in a Bohemia which is a desert country by the sea and in a Forest of Arden where glide gilded snakes and where roam lions with udders all drawn dry . No doubt , Musset scorned Scribe as bitterly as did his fellow lyrist , Heine ; and he was almost the only French dramatist of his day who was not tempted to emulate the tricky dexterity of Scribe ; but none the less do we find many of his creatures living in the pleasant land of Scribiajust as many of Shakespeare 's lighter characters had resided in the same strange country more than two centuries earlier . And while Musset knew about Scribe even if he might detest him and all his works , Shakespeare could have had no foreknowledge of the prolific French playmaker whose productivity was to manifest itself more than two centuries after that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deny that Shakespeare , who may never have set foot outside of his precious isle set in the silver sea , had let his fancy transport him to a territory which we can now recognize as the Scribia known to all students of the French dramatists of the nineteenth century . It is not from any actual Verona in any actual Italy , but from a town of the same name in the heart of Scribia , that two gentlemen departed one after another , destined to show once more that the course of false love does not always run smooth . It is in a Scribian and not in an Italian Venice , where dwelt a Jewish usurer who was tricked out of the deadly forfeit set down in his merry bond by the sharp practice of a quick-witted woman triumphantly passing herself off as a lawyer . In fact , the administration of justice in this fabled Venice is so frankly fantastic and so completely contrary to all the precedents which would govern the  |p843  courts of any actual Venice , that we find ourselves wondering whether this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the adjacent realm of Stage-Land explored and described by Mr. Jerome . Again it is in Scribia and not in Greece that the Athens stood whose Duke wooed and won the Queen of the Amazons , while the British-born Bottom , after marvellous misadventures due to the malice of a fairy king , made ready with his mates to perform a lamentable tragedy at the ducal bridal ceremony . Where except upon the coast of Scribia could we find the Ephesus , the laws of which put the obtruding stranger immediately on trial for his life , and the magic atmosphere of which made it possible for twins separated in infancy and brought up in widely parted places to be in manhood indistinguishable one from the other in speech and even in costume ? And where , except off the coast of Scribia , could that enchanted isle lie which was full of disheartening noises and which was suddenly invaded by a ship 's company cast up by the sea as the result of an artificial tempest raised by the cunning of a royal magician ? Students of imaginary geography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1516 and that the earliest tidings from Altruria were brought by a traveller interviewed by Mr. Howells in 1894. have never had occasion to question the discovery of Scribia in the first half of the nineteenth century , during the lifetime of the man from whom it took its name . Yet we can now perceive that this pleasant land was not unknown to Shakespeare in the first half of the seventeenth century , and that he profited hugely by his information as to its manners , its customs , and its laws , finding them modifiable to suit his convenience . How is this to be explained ? After long meditation over all the peculiarities of this problem I am emboldened to proffer a solution , suggested by the notorious fact that history is prone to repeat itself . This solution I venture to submit herewith to the charitable  |p844  judgment of experts in historical geography . Although Scribia has been a densely populated realm since a time whereof the memory of man runneth not to the contrary , and although it had been visited and traversed and dwelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little later by not a few of the characters of Beaumont and Fletcher , for some inexplicable reason it had failed to be described in any gazetteer of literature ; and at some unknown date it seems to have secluded itself and forbidden the entry of all foreigners , just as Japan chose to shut itself off from the rest of the world . After long scores of years it was rediscovered by Scribe , colonized by his characters , re-introduced into the community of nations , and named anew . It is to be regretted that there is never any hope of rectifying an error in geographic nomenclature ; and as this western continent will continue to bear the name , not of Columbus , but of Americus Vespucius , so to the end of time will Scribia commemorate the ingenious industry of Eugene Scribe , falsely believed to be its original discoverer . And here , to companion the lilting lyric of Andrew Lang , is a copy of verses by Charles Godfrey Leland : Through years of toil , Columbus Unto our New World came ; But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All day in street and market The liar 's name we see ; Columbia ! ? sweet and seldom ? Is left to Poetry . And the names bring back a lesson Taught to the world in youth That the realm of Song and Beauty Is the only home of Truth .
