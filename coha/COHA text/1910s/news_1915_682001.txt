txt Robert Lansing , Secretary of State , and Count von Bernstorff , the German Ambassador , were in conference at the Hotel Biltmore yesterday morning . In ' the course of the conference Count von ' Bernstorff gave ? . o the Secretary a memorandum dealing with questions at issue between this Government and that of Germany . Not one word as to the text or contents of the memorandum was given out by either of the conferees , although it was generally understood to have reference to the German submarine questitin , particularly the Sinking* of the Arabic , among the victims of which disaster were two American citizens . After the conference terminated The Associated Press sent out a statement to the effect that it had been informed on reliable authority that the note given to Secretary Lansing by Count von Bernstorff furnished a basis for further negotiations , this being borne out by the statement of Secretary Lansing that there would probably be another conference between himself and the German Ambassador at an early date . The Associated Press also said that danger of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary did not say anything that would indicate that the issue was about to be settled to the satisfaction of the Washington Government nor would he be quoted as saying that the outlook for an early settlement of the question was bright . He simply refused point blank to answer any question bearing on the German-American situation . " Is the fact that the conference between yourself and the German Ambassador was so very brief , an indication of anything one way or the other , so far- as our relations with Germany are concerned ? " tile Secretary was asked . It is not , " he replied . " The question is of so confidential a nature that I simply can not be expected to make any expression of any kind at the present time . Something may be given out in Washington next week . Certainly nothing will be given out here today , the Secretary added . One report yesterday was that Germany had readmitted the principle that no merchantman would be torpedoed without warning , but that she was still anxious to submit to arbitration the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if to ram the submarine at the time she was torpedoed , and , if the verdict was against the contention or the submarine commander , the extent of damages which Germany would have to pay . A matter that it can be stated on highest authority was not discussed was the status of Captain von Papen , the German Military Attach &; whose name figured in the documents found in possession of Archibald . The conference yesterday lasted for about fifteen minutes . Count von Bernstorff arrived at the Biltmore at 11 o'clock , and was immediately taken ro Secretary Lansing 's apartment . When he reappeared the Ambassador was smiling and greeted the newspaper men cordially . But not a word would he say about his conference with the Secretary of State . Anything that was given out , he said , must come from Mr. Lansing . " There is nothing that I can say at this time . I am sorry , but that 's the case , " said the Ambassador . Dr. Edler , Count von Bernstorff 's secretary , appeared at the hotel an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he brought a message for Secretary Lansing . Dr. Edler , however , would , not admit that he had even seen Secretary Lansing . Secretary Lansing went to Washington last night , and it was said he might submit the Bernstorff memorandum to President Wilson today . Until the President has seen the document nothing as to its contents will be made public . Count von Bernstorff will probably go to Washington some time this week for another conference . Secretary Lansing yesterday took the first step in the policy to be pursued by the United States Government toward Mexico . The Secretary heretofore has declined to receive representatives of any faction , but , inasmuch as it is now his intention to listen to the arguments of all sides , he received Itoberto Pesquiera , the personal adviser of General Carranza . Later Charles A. Douglas , attorney for the Carranza Government . called on Secretary Lansing . The Secretary expressed no opinion to any of his visitors , merely listening to the information which they desired to communicate concerning the progress of the Carranza movement and its claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Villa cause and other independent groups .
