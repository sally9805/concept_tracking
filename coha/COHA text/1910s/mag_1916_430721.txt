 |p619  famous Shanghai riot that had occurred shortly before our arrival , and also with detailed accounts of the massacre that had recently taken place in the south . It was all part of the days work to those hardened to the vicissitudes of life in China , but made a lasting impression on our unaccustomed minds . That night , on retiring , the accounts still haunted my brain , and , unable to sleep , I went over the sensations of the participants in those horrors . I must have been in bed about two hours when suddenly I heard shouts in the distance , then what seemed like hundreds of hurrying footsteps and the most awful screeching . I hastily arose from my bed and ran to the window . I listened . shaking with fear , fully convinced that the rioters were coming , thirsting for foreign blood . I waited for the people of the house to sound the alarm and call us together to make our escape , but the house slept peacefully on , while every moment the din grew wilder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I thought , " for some larger prey , but they will be back . " I waited in vain for some summons , and finally decided to try to sleep , as our friends did not seem to be apprehensive . I spent a restless night , however , and came down to breakfast in pensive mood . " What was that terrible noise last night ? " I inquired . " Was it a riot ? " My friends laughingly replied : " No , only a wedding party . " " A wedding party ' ! Why , what was that blood-curdling yelling and screeching ? " That was their singing and musical instruments . " " Well , " I ejaculated , fervently , " if that was a wedding , may I never hear a riot ! " In the weeks that followed we had the diversion of watching the world 's greatest pageant as it passed under our balcony . Chinese dandies in silks and satins , with the ever-present fan held to protect the eyes from the piercing rays of a semi-tropical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women of the poorer classes pushing wheelbarrows with three or four people in them ; regiments of tall Sikhs with the steel flashing in their turbans ; marines from the battleships of every nation lying in the harbor ; lightly clad Lascars ; wedding and funeral processions with their accompanying din ? one funeral procession took an hour to pass , and the embroidered robes of the Buddhist and Taoist priests fractured the Tenth Commandment for one spectator ; and , last but not least , a monkey in the courtyard across the way that afforded amusement not only to the little Portuguese children that owned it but to the opposite neighbors as well . One hot morning a little file of rickshaws passed and drew up at the front door , and there followed the usual squabble of liberally paid coolies protesting over the fare . Too much engrossed with the foreign street scene to pay much attention to the arrival of a few Americans , I did not even turn my head until I heard a baby voice at my elbow , Auntie , auntie , here we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all dimples , tugging at my skirts . Lois was right ; there they were , and the proper things were said and done ? the things one always does to a niece one has never seen before , and to the parents whom one has not beheld for five years , and has traveled half-way round the world to visit . Behind them stood a quiet , unassuming figure clad in the blue cotton coat and black trousers of her native town . She waited , with a bright smile on her face , absorbed in the happiness of others and watching with surprise the demonstrative ways of these strange foreigners . Finally we came to ourselves enough , and Li Sao-tze was presented ; we liked her from the first for her gentle , modest ways and her unselfishness . It was explained that while we were in the mountains she was to serve as amah and baby 's nurse , as she was away from home . The family belonged to the scholar class ? the gentry , we would call it ? but they were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this manner . and would not lose face thereby . Her husband was dead and her sons " ne'er-do-weels , " and we imagined it was a comfort to her to be rid of them for a season . If Shanghai had been a wonder city to us , it is hard to imagine what it was to Li Saotze . Try to realize yourself your own sensations if you had lived in the third or fourth century in a small country town and were taken , without warning or preparation , to visit a modern city with all its conveniences and inventions ; how excited you would be , and how you would open your eyes , and what stupid questions you would ask ! Not so Li Sao-tze ; she kept her quiet way , unabashed and apparently unimpressed.  |p620  Almost without being told is ) w to turn on the electricity . mid . though her only light at home had been a feeble wick floating in oil , she never changed her expression when the bright light flooded her room . She saw the bells ring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if by magic ; she saw carriages run along smooth streets without horses or men to pull them , when in her native town the roads were full of mud-holes and the elite were carried in sedan chairs , the middle class went on mule , and the poor walked : yet not one of these things moved her Oriental calm or called forth any amazement . Often I longed to break through that outer shell and know the thoughts that stirred below , but my lack of Chinese and her idea of good breeding always prevented . Li Sao-tze was not stupid , however ; she went about her duties in a quiet . competent way , very different from the rougher country women , who never could be trained to be good servants . It was amazing how softly and swiftly she did her work on those little cramped feet of hers . not over three inches long . Every day throughout that long summer in the mountains we would meet her in the narrow winding paths carrying little Lois . In the evening , when we returned home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Li Saotze standing at the top of the bungalow steps with the child in her arms , looking over the mountains , where range piled on range like ocean billows , toward the glories of the sunset beyond . In this case truly East and West had met and mingled , for the baby arms were twined tightly around Li Saotze 's neck , and one needed only a quick glance at Li Sao-tie 's face to see how she regarded her charge . It was a pretty picture ? the dark impassive Oriental features and the laughing " lellow-haired " mite with her pink cheeks and dimples . We would expostulate with Li Sao-tze that her baby was too large and too heavy for her to carry with her bound feet ; as soon as our backs were turned the little tyrant would say , " Li Sao-tze , bao me " and that willing slave would hasten to carry her . A Chinese woman can never refuse a child anything , and the exclamation , " Why , she wanted it 1 " is sufficient excuse for giving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August Li Sao-tze came to her mistress about a strange lump she had had for some time . " Perhaps Sing Si Mu would tell Sing Sien Sung ; they say he is a very clever : JTLOOK 12 July doctor , and he would give her some foreign medicine that would take it away ? " " But , Li Sao-tze , Sing Sien Sung would have to see the lump before he could give you the medicine . " " Oh , I never could let him do that ! That is not our custom . " Then , brightening , she continued : " But I will show it to you , Sing Si Mu , and you can tell him all about it . " It took two months ' persuasion before Li Sao-tze could gain confidence to see the foreign doctor . By that time the lump had grown considerably , and he sadly pronounced the word that makes a foreign patient turn sick and faint . He gently explained to her that if she were operated on immediately he might save her life ; otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news very quietly and with no sign of fear or emotion . She said she would never be operated on , and we knew her sons were terribly antiforeign and would never allow it , even if she would permit it . It was a heavy cloud over our happiness to feel that this gentle creature was marked for such a painful death ? bad enough in America , but infinitely worse in China , where the sick have no pity shown and where the native quacks put the sufferer to horrid torture by way of treatment . I suppose Li Sao-tze ought to have been glad in the thought that her religion was like her skin , and been really happy that it taught little of tenderness to the afflicted ; but it could not console us . We returned with sad hearts to the inland station . We knew when we reached there that Li Sao-tze 's sons would not allow her to remain as amen any longer , much as she would have liked to do so . She had shown strange confidence in being willing to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken some earth with her from her native town , as the other amah had done , to mix in her tea to keep her from homesickness and the dangerous fig shut ( evil spirits ) of a strange place . When we reached our destination . it turned out as we had feared . Li Sao-tze was forced to give up her position ; her gentle reign was over , and then began the reign of terror under Weh Sao-tze , the Militant . Li Sao-tze continued to come for sewing , and we saw her nearly every day . Very shocked was she over Weh Sao-tze 's rough ways , and she would reprimand her for her coarse language to the children . She came regularly to the women 's meetings and would  |p621  repeat the verses so sweetly and so understandingly that her teachers were sure she was a true Christian in her heart , though she did not dare to say so on acoount of her sons . Of all the hymns , she liked to sing " Jesus Loves Me " the best , " because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Poor Li Sao-tze ! it might well rest her heart ? precious little love had she known from the time she had been born , " only an unwelcome girl . " to this day when her sons grudged her food . Over her cradle had been sung the usual Chinese lullaby : " If a boy is born , in a downy bed Let him be wrapped in purple and red : Apparel bright and jewels bring For the noble child who will serve the king . " If a girl is born , in coarse cloth wound , With a tile for a toy , let her lie on the ground : In her bread or her beer be her praise or her blame , And let her not sully her parents ' good name . " Yet Li Sao-tze 's lot was only the common one of Chinese women . One day she failed to appear at the women 's class or for her sewing . When she had been absent for two or three days , her mistress inquired about her from a neighbor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastened to see her , and found her truly very ill , and sent immediately for the foreign doctor , who pronounced the case typhoid fever . He prescribed some remedies and tried to persuade her sons to take her to the foreign hospital , where she could have proper treatment ; they would not listen to him , and as soon as his back was turned threw out his medicines and called in a native quack . Each day the foreigners visited the wretched hovel Li Sao-tze called home , bringing soup and medicine , to find the house filled with a crowd of curious neighbors , talking at the top of their lungs , and each one suggesting some peculiar or deadly mixture ? a truly restful atmosphere for a fever patient ! Li Sao-tze bore it all with her usual patience , but grew gradually weaker ; at length one bight she was very ill , and one of her sons climbed on the roof of the house and the other went out on the mountain-side to represent her spirit ; then the son on the roof would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the son on the mountain would cry in a weird falsetto , " Coming . coming ! " and all the while Li Saotse lay below and listened . The next day Li Sao-tze 's mistress found her excited out of her former calm ; amid the noise and confusion the sufferer clutched her friend 's hand and whispered that her sons thought she was going to die , and that they had threatened to carry her out on the mountain-side. as her spirit would haunt them if she died in the house . Her mistress knew if they did that Li Sao-tze would probably be torn in pieces by wild dogs ; she did her best to reassure her , but there was nothing she could do to prevent such an act ; the sons had absolute power and could have caused the death of all the foreigners if she had interfered . She went home heavy-hearted ? I wonder if my friend would blame her for failing to see any happiness in the Taoist religion on that day ? The suspense continued for several days , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shrill autumn winds howling down the hillside we were haunted by thoughts of the awful fate hanging over our gentle Li Sao-tze , and we would shiver to think that at that very moment she might be out in the cold alone . Fortunately she rallied toward the last and then passed away suddenly , before her sons could execute their threats . No Christian ceremony , so well suited to Li Sao-tze 's quiet spirit , was permitted ; instead , the wild cry of the hired mourners , the feasting , the burning of paper money , and other rites of a Chinese funeral were her lot ; but we drew a sigh of relief that her heart was rested at last , away from further suffering . Now that the long spring evenings have come Li Sao-tze 's daughter-in-law will suddenly stop in the midst of her gossiping with the other women of the courtyard and say with a laugh , " Well , I must be off to wail a wail or two on my mother-in-law 's grave . " With a bowl of food in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on the mountainside where Li Sao-tze sleeps and make the soft spring night hideous with those bloodcurdling wails so heartrending to a stranger until he realizes that such mourning is purely perfunctory . Thus in China comedy and tragedy ever walk hand in hand .
