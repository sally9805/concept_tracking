SCENE : The sun-parlor of JOHN 's country place . The house is on the right side , showing through the open doors the library . The large latticed double doors up centre show the veranda with a rambler rose-bush growing over it . At the left , columns , set at about four-feet intervals down to the tormentor , show beyond a formal garden , with hedges , trees , and shrubs . All indicates comfort and luxury . Between the doors , right , an outdoor fireplace . Before the fireplace there is a large upholstered sofa ; at right centre a tea-table with three chairs around it . At left centre there is a smaller couch with a wicker armchair just below it . It is a bright sunny summer afternoon . When the curtain is fully up , JEAN , an attractive girl of twenty-five , comes running in through the centre door , hotly pursued by REX , a good-looking young man , a year or two older . It is clear that she is the calmer of the two and knows just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ardent , and thoughtless . Both of them laughing as they run on . REX as JEAN seeks refuge below the sofa on the left . Take that back , I tell you . JEAN I wo n't . REX I 'll make you . Starts for her. p. 3 JEAN You ca n't . Runs across stage to the right of the tea-table . REX almost catches her , but she dodges behind the table . She turns and faces him defiantly across the table . Both are panting from the race . Both laugh . Think I 'll let you say that to me ? JEAN Think I 'm afraid of you ? REX I 'll show you . Makes a start for her . JEAN Booh ! No you do n't . Runs to centre , pulling chair out from behind the table and getting behind it . He feints , turns suddenly and catches her . A girlish gasp , " Oh ! " He has her hands , but she draws back , her face averted from him toward the audience , who can see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ REX triumphant , dragging her to centre . Now ! you would , would you ? JEAN struggling . Let me go . He catches her about the waist . REX I could n't think of it . JEAN tries , not very hard , to free herself . You 're so strong  --  it is n't fair . p. 4 REX kisses her lightly . You 're so sweet  --  it is n't fair . JEAN No , Rex . REX Yes , Jean . JEAN You must n't . REX I will ! She struggles . Therefore , REX draws her close , kisses her again , passionately  --  without laughter . JEAN Do n't ! Oh , please ! Somebody will come . REX with the intoxication of such moments . I do n't care who comes  --  I love you ! JEAN graps his hands to release herself . Let me go . REX laughing with the joy of his strength and her weakness . Not till you kiss me , Jean . JEAN hesitates , kisses him shyly on the cheek . There ! She draws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty . REX keeping her imprisoned . Not till you tell me you love me , Jean . She nods , her eyes downcast . No ! Say it ! p. 5 JEAN low voice , but watching him all the same . I  --  er  --  do . REX Do what ? Say it ! She hesitates . He swings her about , brings face close to his . You 've got to say it , Jean . JEAN I love you , Rex  --  are you sure you love me ? REX Am I sure ! You irresistible little JEAN holding him off . And want to marry me , Rex ? REX startled , had not thought of that . They search each other 's eyes . Why  --  er  --  of course . Drops his eyes , sobered . His honor is touched now , so he squares his shoulders . Why , what kind of a man do you take me for ? He holds out his arms again . JEAN giving herself to him , head sinking upon his shoulder . Then , oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and take me away from all this ! She covers her face with her hands and sobs . He pats her tenderly , a manly look on his face . LUCY enters from the garden . She is dressed in white , with a garden hat , and carries a few cut garden flowers in her hand . She is JOHN 's wife , the mistress of the house , sister-in-law to JEAN . She is conspicuously a " sweet " woman  --  affectedly so  --  a contrast with JEAN 's more modern , less delicate charm . JEAN is frank and honest , or wants to be ; LUCY indirect and timid ; pretty but fading , forty , but fighting it . The lovers , startled , break away from each other . A second 's pause of embarrassed silence. p. 6 JEAN the calmer of the two . Laughing . It 's all right , Lucy  --  we 're engaged ! LUCY in a flutter . Well , I should hope so ! Shoots a glance at JEAN . " Ah ? " REX recovering himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and good old John for letting me come over here so much , but now ! how can I ever thank you  --  see't I mean ? LUCY I 'll tell you how . By being a good boy  --  after you are married to John 's little sister . JEAN mock-tragic manner , crosses to him . Rex , have you had a " fearful past " ? How fascinating . REX I 'm going to have a glorious future , all right . JEAN attractively bossy . Not unless you do as I tell you . Going to obey me , Rex ? REX amused . You bet I am . JEAN Then begin now . Go ! Get out ! REX laughing and protesting as JEAN pushes him . I will not . p. 7 JEAN But I want to tell Lucy how nice you are ! Pushes him up to the centre door , REX still lingering . Oh , run along over to the club-house , and by and by if you are good , you can take me out in your new car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laughing . JEAN goes to LUCY . If it had n't been for you I could never have got him . My dear , he has five cars ! Thank you so much . Alone , they throw off the mask worn before men . LUCY embracing JEAN . Jean , you 've done well . They kiss . How delighted John will be Now , dearie , tell me all about it . How did you work it ? JEAN Oh , I simply followed your advice . LUCY smiles . Picked a quarrel with him ? JEAN laughing and nodding gaily . Pretended to believe in economic independence ! LUCY Good ! They always hate that . And then you ran away . JEAN Of course . ( Quickly ) p. 8 LUCY And he after you ? ( Quickly ) JEAN Of course . ( Quickly ) LUCY And you let him catch you ? ( Quickly ) JEAN Of course  --  well he caught me . LUCY both laughing . Oh , I can guess the rest . JEAN Why , it did n't take five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last through all eternity  --  Is n't love wonderful ! JEAN casually . Um-hum . LUCY looks up . But you do love him , do n't you , dear ? JEAN I do not . LUCY What ? Why , what do you mean ? JEAN I did then , for a minute  --  I do n't now . I hate him now . LUCY Oh . The Bakers are one of the wealthiest families in the country  --  you can learn to love him . JEAN shrugs and turns away . Now , now , no worrying . It brings wrinkles . p. 9 JEAN Lucy , what is the use of bluffing each other ? LUCY Jean , you 're growing cynical . You must stop thinking about that boy at the law school . Do you understand ? JEAN Do n't  --  do n't . LUCY Ah , you poor child . John would kill me if he heard me say this , but I 'm sorry for you . Why could n't you wait , dear ? JEAN He never asked me to . LUCY Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't be fair . it takes so long to get started  --  everything costs so much . Why , nowadays , men in the professions  --  unless they have private means  --  they ca n't marry until nearly forty . Helen told me that . Pause . When Bob 's forty , I 'll be forty . LUCY I know , I know . JEAN Oh , Bob and I 'll get over it , I suppose  --  people do . Sighs . Some day he 'll smile and say : " Just think , once I loved that fat old thing . " Suddenly changes to sobbing . Oh , Lucy , when Rex caught me and kissed me just now , I shut my eyes and tried to think it was Bob . LUCY But you ca n't keep on thinking so , dear . p. 10 JEAN And that is n't the worst . When he held me close and I could n't get away , I began to forget Bob  --  to forget everything  --  ugh ! Breaks off , overcome with shame . But not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing at all . LUCY Poor little Jean . JEAN buries her head on LUCY 's breast and sobs it out . Oh , I feel like the devil , dear . He does n't want to marry me any more than I want to marry him  --  I trapped him into it . I trapped him . The BUTLER and the second man enter and place tea-service on the table and the tea-wagon behind and to the right of the table . REX enters from centre as the men depart . REX Ready , Jean ? Car 's outside . To LUCY . Oh , say , John 's here . Indicating terrace . LUCY Oh , and I was n't there to meet him . Going . He 'll take my head off . REX Just a minute ; your cousin Theodore and the Judge came out from town with him . Here for the week-end ? LUCY starts to go . Yes . REX I would n't go out there if I were you . John and Theodore are having a fine old-fashioned family fight with the Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? REX They shut up when they saw me . All I heard was the parson  --  " Marriage is a social institution . " Grand old row though . Catching sight of servants . Looks as if they were coming in here . Come on , Jean . Let 's go this way and duck the family . Starts up to the left . JEAN starts to follow REX , but LUCY stops her . LUCY Jean , what are you going to do ? JEAN What am I going to do ? Why , I 'm going to follow  --  the only profession I have been allowed to learn . REX What 's this ? What profession ? JEAN runs across and kisses him lightly . It is called marriage , my dear . She gives him a teasing caress and they run off laughing . LUCY Yes , that 's what it is called . Enter from garden JOHN , the JUDGE , who is UNCLE EVERETT , and COUSIN THEODORE . JOHN , the masterful type of successful American business man ; well set up , close-cropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , quick movements , quick temper ; well satisfied with himself and the world . He has plenty of ability but very little perception ; does n't know much  --  not even this fact  --  but he is as generous with his own money as he is intolerant of other people 's opinions . Just now he is rather excited . UNCLE EVERETT is a genial satirist  --  not only of human nature but of human institutions . COUSIN THEODORE , a careworn rector , who though he buttons his collar behind likes those who do n't ; a noble soul , self-sacrificing and sanctified , who does not obtrude his profession upon others  --  never talks shop unless asked to do so , and prides himself upon not being a bigot . JOHN and JUDGE are smoking cigars . As these characters enter they are continuing an earnest discussion with the intimate manner of friendly concern . UNCLE EVERETT is humorous and amused . As they enter , LUCY goes behind the table and sits , busying herself with the tea-things. p. 12 THEODORE But , Uncle Everett , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never heard of such a thing . THEODORE But , Uncle Everett , has n't Aunt Julia always been a good wife to you ? UNCLE EVERETT Quite so , Theodore , quite so ; a good wife , a good wife . JOHN And a devoted mother to your children ? UNCLE EVERETT Devoted , John , devoted . JOHN Has n't she always obeyed you , Uncle Everett ? UNCLE EVERETT Yes , John  --  a true old-fashioned woman . THEODORE She has been a great help in the parish work , Uncle Everett . UNCLE EVERETT An earnest worker in the vineyard , Theodore  --  in fact , I might say , a model female . JOHN Then why , why do you want a divorce ? UNCLE EVERETT calmly . Because , damn it , I do n't like her ! LUCY in surprised whisper . Divorce ? JOHN How about Aunt Julia ? UNCLE EVERETT She does n't like me . JOHN crosses to the right. p. 13 THEODORE Ah , yes , fault on both sides . Crosses to sofa and sits down . UNCLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortitude , to the end !  --  we still are . Just listen to this telegram . Reaches in his pocket  --  brings out the telegram . LUCY seated behind table , puzzled . From Aunt Julia ? UNCLE EVERETT unfolding telegram . Yes , from Aunt Julia in Reno . Not used to travelling without me ; knew I 'd worry . Puts on glasses . A night-letter . Your aunt Julia was always a frugal wife , John  --  except with words . She never could keep within ten words . Reads . " Arrived safely . Charming rooms with plenty of air and sunlight . Our case docketed for March 15th . Wish you were here to see the women in Divorce Row  --  overdressed and underbred . " Looks up . Rather neat , eh ? " Overdressed and underbred . " Resumes reading . " I should love to hear your comments on the various types . " Now is n't that sweet of her ? Well , you know , I always could make her laugh  --  except when I made her cry . Resumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now folds up telegramis n't that a nice message to receive from a wife suing for divorce ? Bet you happily married people could n't beat that . Pats telegram and puts it in pocket. p. 14 JOHN like a practical business man  --  breaking in . But if there 's no other woman , no other man  --  what 's it all about ? UNCLE EVERETT She likes her beefsteak well done ; I like mine underdone . She likes one window open so much indicates four inches ; I like all the windows open wide . She likes to stay at home ; I like to travel . She loves the opera and hates the theatre ; I love the theatre and hate the opera . She THEODORE Are n't you willing to make a few little sacrifices for each other ? UNCLE EVERETT A few ? Done nothing but make sacrifices for a quarter of a century , Theodore . Why , I remember the first dinner we had together after we were pronounced man and wife , with a full choral service and a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for those simple days . " Darling , " I asked my blushing bride , " do you like tutti-frutti ? " " I adore it , dearest , " she murmured . I hated it , but nobly sacrificed myself , gave her tutti-frutti and gained character every evening of our honeymoon . Then when we got back and began our " new life " together in our " little home , " my darling gave me tutti-frutti and indigestion three times a week until I nearly died . LUCY But why did n't you tell her ? p. 15 UNCLE EVERETT I did finally . By the time we celebrated our wooden wedding , I got chronic dyspepsia and struck . " You may like this stuff  --  darling , " I said , " but I hate it . " What do you think she said ? " Dearest , I hate it , too . " " Then why in thunder have you had it all these years , sweetheart ? " " Because I thought you liked it , beloved . " That tells the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in common but a love of divorce and a mutual hatred of tutti-frutti . JOHN Bah ! All a cloak to hide the true story , and you know it . UNCLE EVERETT I know it . Looks guilty . Do you want to know the truth ? Glances about and with a hushed voice . John , Lucy , Theodore , your aunt Julia has broken her marriage vow . THEODORE Not Aunt Julia ! UNCLE EVERETT Yes , Aunt Julia . Twenty-five years ago last June she solemnly vowed before God and some of the nicest people in town to love me until death . But she has broken her marriage vow , she does n't love me any more than I love her , not in the least . THEODORE Oh , come , the promise to love does n't mean that . UNCLE EVERETT Then what does it mean ? THEODORE It means  --  well , it means you must try to love . p. 16 UNCLE EVERETT Try . Good Lord , for twenty-five years , a quarter of a century , we have been trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , your common sense , a distinguished member of the bar  --  to break up his home for that ? Rot ! Brings chair to the table and sits down . UNCLE EVERETT Right again , John , that is not why I am breaking up my home . I prefer my club . What does the modern home amount to , anyway ? Merely a place to leave your wife . LUCY How could you neglect Aunt Julia ? UNCLE EVERETT But I did n't neglect her . I sacrificed myself , stayed at home , listened to her prattle about clothes and people , people and clothes  --  and got bored to death every night like a good husband . LUCY That 's the way men always talk . It never occurs to you that business , business , business , is just as much of a bore to us . UNCLE EVERETT Wrong again , Lucy . It did occur to me . I knew I bored her  --  she told me so ; she knew she bored me , I told her so . Just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? UNCLE EVERETT We are doing it now . Getting a divorce . What more could we do ? p. 17 JOHN You ought to be ashamed . Every man should love his home . UNCLE EVERETT Certainly , every man should love his wife , too . But a promise ca n't make you love . It only makes you lie . THEODORE I love my home . JOHN So do I. He glances sternly at LUCY . LUCY nervously . So do I. UNCLE EVERETT All right , stick to it , if you love it !  --  only do n't claim credit for doing what you enjoy . Now , I detest domesticity myself , yet I stuck to it all the same  --  for a quarter of a century , and at last  --  I 'm free to tell the truth about it . Just think of it , Lucy , free to utter those things about marriage we all know but do n't dare say ! Free to be honest , John . No longer a hypocrite , Theodore , a soul set free  --  two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single thought  --  two hearts that beat as one . THEODORE rises and comes to centre . Seriously , Uncle Everett , " whom God hath joined together " ! LUCY Yes , Uncle Everett , marriages are made in heaven . UNCLE EVERETT seeing through her bluff . I see , Lucy , I see , but your aunt Julia and I were joined together by a pink parasol made in Paris . p. 18 LUCY Pink parasol ! JOHN exasperated . Oh , stop your fooling and speak the truth , man ! UNCLE EVERETT The truth ? Just what I 'm doing , John , but nobody wants or expects the truth about marriage  --  that 's why you think I 'm fooling . A very pretty parasol  --  but it was n't made in heaven , Lucy . You see God made poor dear Julia pale , but on that fatal day twenty-five years ago the pink parasol , not God , made her rosy and irresistible . I did the rest  --  with the aid of a clergyman , whom I tipped even more liberally than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it  --  blame her , blame the parasol , blame the parson  --  but do not , my dear Theodore , blame God for our own mistakes . It 's so blasphemous . They are all seated at the tea-table . LUCY We 've forgotten all about the tea . She hands a cup of tea to the JUDGE . UNCLE EVERETT Ah ! yes  --  and I love tea  --  your aunt Julia hates it . To THEODORE . That 's another thing . LUCY And to think we invited Uncle Everett here  --  of all people ! To-day of all days ! To JOHN . We must n't let Rex know  --  the Bakers do n't believe in divorce . p. 19 JOHN leaning forward excited . What 's this  --  you do n't mean Jean is engaged at last ? Why did n't you tell me ! To others , loud , excited , crossing to the centre . Jean has landed him ! We 're marrying into the Baker family ! Why , Jean 'll have more money than any of us !  --  Well , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before little Jean now ! My ! Kisses LUCY . Lucy , you 're a wonder  --  Those pearls  --  I 'll buy them , they 're yours ? LUCY Now , if we could only get Helen to give up her unwomanly ambitions for a scientific career . JOHN Yes , to give up this absurd fad for scientific research , and be safely married to some nice man . THEODORE What 's the matter with her scientist , Ernest Hamilton ? JOHN I said some nice man . UNCLE EVERETT sipping tea . Meaning one having money ? THEODORE The Hamiltons are an older family than the Bakers , older than our own . UNCLE EVERETT Meaning they once had money . JOHN Waste a beauty on a bacteriologist ?  --  A crime ! p. 20 THEODORE See here , John , Ernest Hamilton is the finest fellow in the world , and if you expect me  --  why did you ask me here ? UNCLE EVERETT Far as I can see , we 're here to help one of the girls marry a man she does n't love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does . THEODORE as LUCY hands him a cup of tea . John , Doctor Carmen , the head of the Institute , told me the other day that Hamilton has the biggest future of all those brilliant fellows down there . Why , he has already been called one of the most useful men in America . JOHN But he gets just two thousand dollars a year . Lucy , send for Helen . This is a practical world , Theodore . LUCY goes obediently . UNCLE EVERETT Well , you 're one of the trustees of the Baker Institute . Why not give the young man a raise ? JOHN standing , legs apart , hands in pockets , jingling coins . Oh , that 's not a bad salary for scientists , college professors , and that sort of thing . Why , even Doctor Carmen , the head of the Institute , gets less than the superintendent of my mills . To THEODORE . No future in science . Got to look at these things practically , Theodore . p. 21 UNCLE EVERETT Yes , you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the superintendent of John 's mills saves the company thousands of dollars . This bacteriologist merely saves the nation thousands of babies . All our laws , written and unwritten , value private property above human life  --  I 'm a distinguished jurist and I always render my decisions accordingly  --  I 'd be reversed by the United States Supreme Court if I did n't ! We 're all rewarded in inverse ratio to our usefulness to society , Theodore . That 's what business men cail " practical . " JOHN good-naturedly . Muck-raker ! UNCLE EVERETT It 's all on a sliding scale , John . For keeping up the cost of living , you and old man Baker get  --  oh , so much . Stretches arms out full length . For saving the Constitution , I get , well , I get a good deal myself . Rises , hands three feet apart . For saving in wages and operating expenses , your superintendent gets  --  so much . Hands two feet apart . For saving human life , Ernest Hamilton gets  --  so much . Hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets  --  so much . Holds up two forefingers an inch apart . Now if any one came along and saved the world  --  To JOHN. p. 22 THEODORE interrupts . They crucified Him . JOHN re-enter LUCY ; JOHN rises and turns to her . Where 's Helen ? THEODORE places cup on table . LUCY comes to table timidly . Tried my best , John , but Helen says she prefers to talk with you alone some time . JOHN furious . She prefers ? Am I master in my own house or not ! UNCLE EVERETT Of course you are , John ; that 's why your sister left it . THEODORE John , you ca n't stop Helen marrying Ernest , if she wants to  --  he 's head over heels in love with her . Others show surprise . LUCY What ! Are you sure ? JOHN to LUCY . You told me he was a woman-hater . You told me he was in love with his work . LUCY But , John , dear , I thought he was . He 's always so brusque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All a bluff , Lucy  --  thinks there 's no hope for him , poor boy . LUCY to JOHN . And she is mad about him ! What 'll we do ? p. 23 JOHN to LUCY . And he is on the way out here now ! What can we do ? UNCLE EVERETT What 's this , coming here ? Before she even gets her trunk unpacked ? THEODORE What did I tell you ? Head over heels . JOHN Oh , he does n't know she got back this morning  --  thinks she 's still in Paris . UNCLE EVERETT Then why is he coming ? JOHN goes up stage . Because I invited him , damn it . THEODORE You invited him ? He and JUDGE laugh at JOHN . LUCY But when we invited him we thought Helen would not be back till next week . We wanted to have a frank talk with him first . JOHN That 's why we invited you fellows . UNCLE EVERETT to THEODORE . Oh , we 're to do the dirty work . As usual . JOHN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to highbrows , and you do . And Theodore , here  --  well , Hamilton 's a Harvard man , so 's Theodore . THEODORE You want us to talk to him about the love microbe ? p. 24 JOHN I want you to put it up to him as a gentleman to quit compromising my sister . UNCLE EVERETT Has he got the habit ? JOHN with his " Do be serious " manner . But you know perfectly well what happened a month ago , before she sailed . LUCY Everybody knows . UNCLE EVERETT Yes , the newspapers were full of it . JOHN and LUCY , startled and perplexed . You mean his discovery of the Hamilton antitoxin . He knows they mean nothing of the sort . JOHN I mean our discovery that he kept her working with him all night in his laboratory . LUCY Without a chaperon . UNCLE EVERETT Oh , shocking , Lucy , shocking . JOHN Come . You see . Something 's got to be done at once and done delicately . UNCLE EVERETT bursts out laughingWell , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't met for a month and to-night there 's a moon . THEODORE also laughing . You may as well give in , John  --  the simplest solution . p. 25 LUCY timidly . John , perhaps , after all , they are right . Think how she treats all the nice men . JOHN to LUCY . Who 's doing this ? You go tell Helen  --  that her Uncle Everett wants to see her ! That 'll fetch her . JOHN goes up to the door at centre . LUCY shrugs , starts reluctantly , then lingers listening at the door on the right . THEODORE Now , uncle , you have more influence over Helen than any of us  --  do n't let her know about  --  Aunt Julia . UNCLE EVERETT Of course not . Never let the rising generation suspect the truth about marriage  --  if you want ' em to marry . THEODORE modestly , charmingly , not preachy . There are other truths than unpleasant truths , Uncle Everett , other marriages than unhappy marriages . UNCLE EVERETT seriously . Want me to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LUCY surprised . Why , uncle ! Even you must admit that Theodore and poor dear Mary are happy . p. 26 UNCLE EVERETT from the sofa . Happy ? What 's that got to do with marriage ? Selfish to be happy . Theodore told me so . A social institution . When a boy kisses a girl she must first inquire : " Are you doing this for the benefit of society ? " And if he really loves her he will answer : " Yes , a sacrifice to gain character . " Then , but not till then , " Darling , " she will murmur , " do your duty , " and he 'll do it . LUCY brightly . Well , Theodore has certainly done his duty to society  --  six children ! UNCLE EVERETT Then society has n't done it 's duty by Thodore  --  one salary . JOHN coming back to centre . The more credit to him ! He and Mary have sacrificed everything to their children , and the church  --  even health and success . THEODORE at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want your praise . We love each other through it ' all ! Poverty , suffering , even separation , have only drawn us closer . Why , in her last letter from the sanitarium she said , she said Suddenly overcome with emotions , turns abruptly . Excuse me , Lucy He breaks down and goes into the house. p. 27 UNCLE EVERETT rises  --  facing THEODORE 's exit  --  with a touch of tenderness . They do n't need your praise or pity . They need something more substantial  --  and , by George , I 'll raise it for them ! Turns to JOHN , who interrupts . JOHN reprovingly . See the example he sets to society . Character ! Courage ! UNCLE EVERETT Character and courage ca n't restore Marry 's radiant health , Theodore 's brilliant youth . LUCY Ah , but they have their children . Think how they adore those beautiful children . UNCLE EVERETT Think how they rear those beautiful children  --  in the streets . One boy gone to the devil already from things picked up in the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you really want the truth why , a marriage like mine is worth a dozen like Theodore 's  --  to society . Look at my well-launched children . Look at my successful career , as a jackal to big business , look at my now perfectly contented spouse . LUCY blinking , JOHN scowling . Yes , look at her ?  --  getting a divorce . p. 28 UNCLE EVERETT Is the object of marriage merely to stay married ? Holy matrimony a vulgar endurance contest ? Shocking , Lucy , shocking ! JOHN reprovingly sharp . Then , what is the object of marriage ? UNCLE EVERETT coming down behind table  --  in same manner . Something you two have never attained , John  --  children ! JOHN and LUCY turn their backs . But it takes more than character and courage to raise kids , it takes cash . Takes check-book from JOHN 's pocket and fountain-pen from his own . Offering them . I supply the ink , you supply the check . Fifty-fifty . JOHN snatches away check-book . Why should I pay for the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's children pay for you ? JOHN For me ! UNCLE EVERETT rapidly . If none of us had any more children than you , who 'd work your mills , consume your products , increase your dividends ? LUCY Please , John , I 'll give up those pearls . UNCLE EVERETT rapidly . We 're in the world for two social purposes , John , production and reproduction . Theodore and Mary are underpaid for the one , and not paid at all for the other , so they are failing at booth . But simply because they never complain , simply because , God bless ' em , they love each other through it all , you call it a " successful marriage "  --  hand them out praise and pity . Humph ! that 's cheap . Sits behind table , hands pen to JOHN , spreads out check-book . Go on , pay your honest debts . p. 29 JOHN seated at left of the table , he writes a check . You make me tired with all your talk . Looking up , he stops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UNCLE EVERETT Leave that to me . You sign that check ! While JOHN writes . And now they 've got to sacrifice even their pride , the one thing left to sacrifice . JOHN Well , you get this to them somehow . Hands check to JUDGE , who takes it eagerly . UNCLE EVERETT Five thousand ? Generous John ! JOHN impatiently . Never mind about me . That problem is all settled  --  Lucy , I thought I told you to find Helen . LUCY , in a guilty hurry , goes out . UNCLE EVERETT Charity never settles problems , John ; it perpetuates them . We ca n't cure social defects by individual treatment . JOHN seated at the table  --  more impatiently . Does talk settle anything ? UNCLE EVERETT Everything ! Just got this out of you waving checkby talk . We may even settle the marriage problem if we talk honestly  --  only , you wo n't . LUCY and THEODORE enter. p. 30 LUCY She 'll be down in a moment . THEODORE Now remember , uncle , not a word about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , I 'm not divorced yet . So I 'll lie like a married man . JOHN Ha ! I have it . I know how to work this thing . UNCLE EVERETT What 're you going to do , John ? JOHN You 'll see . As long as she would n't stay abroad , I 'm going to make her give up her job . That 'll put a stop to this gossip  --  that 'll keep them apart . THEODORE John , these two love each other . UNCLE EVERETT Yes , young people still fall in love . They will do it . Only , if you church people had any imagination , you 'd change your tactics . If we ever expect to reform marriage , instead of making it harder to get apart , we 've got to make it easier to stay together . LUCY sits back of table . Ssh , here she comes . THEODORE to the JUDGE . Please , please , do n't say such things before her . UNCLE EVERETT I wo n't tell the truth ! Ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeting THEODORE and the JUDGE affectionately . Hello , uncle  --  hello , Theodore  --  I 'm so sorry to hear about dear Mary . As THEODORE turns away , she speaks to the JUDGE . But why did n't Aunt Julia come ? Slight panic in the family group . . Is she ill , too ? UNCLE EVERETT Yes , needed a complete change . Gone to Re-Re-Rio Janeiro  --  Lie number one . To JOHN . JUDGE crosses the stage and sits on the couch . Another silence . JUDGE wags head . LUCY makes tea for HELEN . JOHN has seated himself in a chair on the left . THEODORE sits to the right of the table . HELEN looks at each and smiles . HELEN taking cup from LUCY . Well , go on ! THEODORE Go on with what ? HELEN stirring tea . Whatever it was I interrupted . UNCLE EVERETT with great gravity . We were just discussing holy matrimony . HELEN smiles and nods . I might have guessed it . All look consciously at one another . Everybody 's talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is woman 's only true career . HELEN sipping her tea . So Lucy tells me , Cousin Theodore . But a woman can not pursue her career . Her career must pursue her , otherwise she is unwomanly . UNCLE EVERETT on sofa . Ahem ! As we passed the garden a while ago , I think I saw your little sister being pursued by her career . HELEN laughing . She and the JUDGE understand each other . Yes , uncle , but Jean is a true woman . I 'm only a new woman . UNCLE EVERETT All the same , you 'll be an old woman some day  --  if you do n't watch out . HELEN Ah , yes , my life 's a failure . I have n't trapped a man into a contract to support me . LUCY You ought to be ashamed  --  making marriage so mercenary . Have n't you new women any sentiment ? HELEN returning cup . Enough sentiment not to make a mercenary marriage , Lucy , dear . LUCY Some more tea ? HELEN Not any , thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of a marriage will you make ? p. 33 HELEN Not any , thank you , uncle . I do n't believe in marriage . JUDGE amused , LUCY shocked , THEODORE distressed , JOHN pleased . UNCLE EVERETT with assumed gravity . What ! You do n't believe in holy matrimony ? HELEN Only as a last extremity , uncle , like  --  UN-HOLY DIVORCE . UNCLE EVERETT in alarm . What do you know about that ? HELEN I know all about it ! All arise in alarm . I have been reading up on the subject . All sit with relief . THEODORE Come now , simply because many young people rush into marriage without thinking LUCY interrupts . Simply because these new women JOHN Simply because one marriage in a thousand ends in divorce ! HELEN interrupting . One in a thousand ! Dear me . In America there 's one divorce to every eleven marriages , John . JOHN turning with others to JUDGE incredulously . One in eleven ? Is that true ? p. 34 UNCLE EVERETT It is not . JOHN There ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scientist . JOHN goes behind sofa and down to the left . HELEN According to last year 's census reports , one divorce to every eleven marriages . UNCLE EVERETT But do n't you know that according to this year 's census reports there is one divorce to every ten marriages ? JOHN exasperated at the JUDGE 's defection . LUCY Well , I may be old-fashioned , but it seems to me that nice girls should n't think , of such things their husbands will tell them all they ought to know about marriage  --  after they 're married . HELEN comedy . I see . In other words , nice girls must not rush in without thinking , but they must n't think until after they rush in . You make it all so simple for us . UNCLE EVERETT Right ! The way to cure all evil is for " nice people " to close their minds and mouths to it . " Unpleasant " for the mind  --  " leaves a bad taste in the mouth . " Goes up stage and sits. p. 35 JOHN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sister of mine works for a living . You get just nine hundred a year at the Institute  --  HELEN to the others , blaspheming JOHN 's gods with her smiling flippancy . Oh , but John 's so rich now , his credit can stand having a working girl in the family . LUCY But , my dear , it 's so hard to explain you to one 's friends . HELEN dryly . Then you have the wrong kind of friends , my dear . It 's quite smart nowadays for women to have a job . LUCY But , Helen , going down-town every day ! working with those horrible highbrows ? It seems so , well , so unwomanly . HELEN But when I first came back from college , did n't I try my best to be " womanly " ? Instead of going down-town and working with highbrows , I stayed uptown and played with lowbrows until I was bored to death . LUCY secretly envies HELEN , but must play up to JOHN 's " ideals " . Well I 'm just an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says so . HELEN smiling . But suppose you have n't any husband ! What can a poor spinster do in the home ? p. 36 LUCY vexed but not ill-natured . She can stay in it  --  till she gets one . That 's what the old-fashioned spinster used to do . HELEN But the old-fashioned spinster used to  --  SPIN . LUCY becoming nettled , for the very reason that she envies HELEN . At any rate , even the new-fashioned spinster need n't stay out of her home all night ! And get herself compromised ! Talked about ! Sent abroad by her family ! Still higher . Or if she does , she ought to know enough to remain abroad until the gossip blows over , and it has n't blown over . Helen , every one is still talking about that night . HELEN mock-romantically . Ah , that wonderful night ! JOHN jumps up from his chair . All start , shocked , excepting JUDGE . The night he discovered the Hamilton antitoxin ! The night that made the Baker Institute famous ! And just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a hand in the unwomanly work of saving children 's lives ! Drops that note and burlesques maidenly coyness . But of course an old-fashioned spinster would have blushed and said : " Excuse me , Doctor Hamilton , but now we must let a whole year 's work go to waste because you are a man and I am a woman , and it 's dark outdoors ! " p. 37 LUCY You think we ca n't see through all this ? Science  --  fiddlesticks ! The good-looking young scientist  --  that 's why you could n't stay abroad . Came back in a month . We see it  --  John sees it JOHN You 're right , Lucy . See here , young lady , I offered to pay all your expenses abroad for a year . As Lucy says , you came back in a month . You did n't seem to appreciate it  --  well , the trustees of the Institute are now to give Doctor Hamilton a year abroad . How do you like that ? All turn to see how she likes it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , others show surprise . Just what he needs ! Doctor Metchnikoff told me in Paris that America always kills its big men with routine . When do we start , John ? JOHN " We " ! Think you are going ? HELEN Of course ! I 'm his assistant  --  quite indispensable to him . To all . Oh , well , if you do n't believe me  --  ask him . JOHN Paris ! Alone ! With a man ! Good Lord ! What next ! Here 's where I call a halt ! HELEN But if my job calls me , I really do n't see what you have to say about it , John . p. 38 JOHN smiling  --  not snarling . He loves and admires her . Better not defy me , Helen ! HELEN quite good-naturedly . Better not bully me , John ! JOHN I am your brother ! HELEN But not my  --  owner . JOHN a gesture sweeping all that aside . That 's all right in theory , but this is a practical world . You give up this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I refuse to give up either , John ? JOHN loud . Then , as a trustee of the Baker Institute of Medical Experiment , I ask for your resignation  --  right here and now ! Turns away  --  all settled . I guess that will hold her a while ! HELEN rises . On the contrary , I must go to paris now . Nothing else to do . JOHN turns back  --  triumphant smile . You will , eh ? Who 'll pay your expenses this time ? HELEN calmly matter-of-fact . Doctor Hamilton . p. 39 JOHN all scandalized except JUDGE . What ! THEODORE rises . Helen  --  please ! LUCY You ought n't to say such things , my dear , even in joke . HELEN He 'll be delighted to take me  --  as his private secretary , if I ask him . Pause . I 'll telephone him at once . Going to right to THEODORE , who stops her . UNCLE EVERETT John , she 's got you  --  might as well quit . Seated up stage . JOHN confidently . Nonsense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you 're so independent , my dear , why do n't you marry your scientist and be done with it . HELEN You want to know why ? Can you keep a secret ? She comes in front of table  --  all gather about her . He has never asked me ! All smile . LUCY match-making ardor . No wonder , dear ; he has never seen you except in that awful apron . Now in one of these stunning frocks John bought you in Paris , or in one of the evening gowns , you are quite irresistible . p. 40 UNCLE EVERETT apart to JOHN . Irresistible ? Pink parasol  --  same old game . HELEN suppressing mirth and amusement at LUCY . Thanks for your advice , Lucy , but , you see , I do n't want him to ask me . LUCY What ! You do n't want him ! HELEN Why , I 've had all I could do to keep him from it . All dumfounded . LUCY But suppose he did ask you , dear ? HELEN she 's not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , I 'd simply refer the matter to John . If John said , " Love him "  --  I 'd love him ; if John said " Do n't love him "  --  I do n't love him . I 'd turn it off like electric light . LUCY insinuating . Oh , you ca n't deceive us  --  we know how much you admire him . HELEN warmly . The truth is the surest way to deceive them . Oh , no , you do n't . They all look surprised again . Not even he does . Did you ever hear how he risked his life in battle ? Why , to me he 's a perfect hero of romance ! p. 41 JOHN sneers . Never even saw a battle  --  mollycoddle germ-killer . HELEN The battle against yellow fever , John , down in Cuba . No drums to make him brave , no correspondents to make him famous  --  merely rolled up his sleeve and let an innocent-looking mosquito bite him , and then took notes on his symptoms till he became delirious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the others died . She is betrayed into showing considerable feeling , after all . THEODORE after a pause . Old-fashioned maidens used to marry their heroes , Helen . HELEN bracing up , getting herself together . With a glance at JOHN  --  smiling . But this new-fashioned hero gets only two thousand a year , Theodore . JOHN She 's got some sense left . THEODORE rises and goes down stage a little , disappointed . Helen ! You selfish , too ? Why , Mary and I married on half that , did n't we , John ? and see how successful our marriage has been . He looks around , but all drop eyes . UNCLE EVERETT Could n't you live on that , Helen ? p. 42 HELEN quietly . Live ? Yes , but Doctor Hamilton needs every cent of that enormous salary for his work  --  books , travel , scientific conferences  --  all the advantages he simply must have if he 's to do his best for the world . Why , nowadays the most selfish thing a girl can do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe in marriage , I tell you  --  not at any price . Shrug . THEODORE All the same , deep down under it all you have a true woman 's yearning for a home to care for and a mate to love . He finds that she is in tears . Why , my dear child , what 's the matter ? HELEN to all of them , strong . She has reached her limit . Ca n't stand any more . Oh , why ca n't you let me alone ! You make what ought to be the holiest and most beautiful thing in life the most horrible and dishonest . I hate marriage  --  I hate it . THEODORE going down to HELEN . Oh , just you wait till the right one comes along . BUTLER entering  --  to LUCY . Doctor Hamilton has come , ma'am . HELEN with old-fashioned gasp . Good gracious ! What 's he doing here ? No answer . What does this mean ? Looks from one to other , but no one answers. p. 43 LUCY calmly to BUTLER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the tea-wagon . HELEN with increasing perturbation . Does he know I 'm here ? No answer . Surely you did n't invite him ? JOHN Why , er UNCLE EVERETT Why not ? HELEN to JUDGE . But they never invite him . They do n't " approve " of him . UNCLE EVERETT Oh , John will learn to love him . JOHN Why , er UNCLE EVERETT John issued the invitation himself . HELEN stops . Then I understand ! Excited but smilingly . You think it 's my last chance to marry . A plot to entrap him . JOHN Nothing of the sort . HELEN going . Oh , I understand now . Ugh ! these horrible relatives ! But it 's no use ! I 'm going out and I 'm going to stay out until he 's gone ! She goes into the garden. p. 44 UNCLE EVERETT Fighting hard , poor child ! THEODORE to LUCY . But what 'll we do ? UNCLE EVERETT Do n't worry  --  she ca n't stay away  --  the sweet thing ! JOHN with something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , make a fuss over him . UNCLE EVERETT Going to surrender , John ? JOHN knowingly . What I 'm going to do requires finesse. Now that SHE 'S home I 'll get HIM sent abroad for a year he 'll jump at the chance . That 'll keep them apart . Now , then , follow my lead . Jolly him up , I tell you . LUCY rises . In a flutter , seeing HAMILTON approach . Oh , dear ! How does one talk to highbrows ? To JUDGE . UNCLE EVERETT Talk to him about himself  --  highbrows , lowbrows  --  ALL men love it . The BUTLER announces DOCTOR HAMILTON . Enter ERNEST HAMILTON , about thirty-five years old ; although a highbrow , he looks like a pretty good fellow , and he is not in the least shy or embarrassed , being " well born and well bred . " He talks very rapidly ; does not take the trouble to despise conventions ; merely views them with frank , scientific curiosity , tinged with amused contempt . He is startlingly honest. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance . Ah , Doctor Hamilton ! Delighted to see you on my little farm at last . Out here I 'm just a plain old-fashioned farmer . Shakes hands effusively . ERNEST glances about at the magnificence , raises his eyebrows , and smiles quietly to himself . Says nothing at first to these greetings ; merely bows urbanely , complete master of self and situation . LUCY comes down in front of the table and , after greeting him , returns to her seat with an affected manner before a stranger . Doctor Hamilton ! So good of you to come . THEODORE an old friend . How are you , Ernest ? Glad to see you . Shakes hands . LUCY I do n't think you 've met Judge Grey . UNCLE EVERETT rising . Humorously adopting their manner , across table . Charmed ! I 've heard so much about you  --  from  --  ahem  --  my niece Sits again . LUCY hastily coming to ERNEST 's rescue . A cup of tea , Doctor Hamilton ? ERNEST not disturbed by mention of HELEN . Thanks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he catches on and has fun with them . p. 46 JOHN standing right of table , while LUCY makes tea , trustee manner . I have often desired to express my admiration of your heroism in the war against yellow fever in er  --  ah UNCLE EVERETT Cuba JOHN Cuba , when you let an innocent-looking mosquito bite you , and , and Looks around for help . LUCY coming to JOHN 's rescue , nodding and poising the tongs . And then took notes on your symptoms till you became delirious ! ERNEST to LUCY . No sugar , thanks . UNCLE EVERETT No drums to make you famous  --  no correspondents to make you brave . JOHN nudges JUDGE to call his attention to his blunder . To JOHN . I got that wrong , did n't I ? I mean the other way round ! ERNEST to LUCY poising cream-pitcher . No cream , please . JOHN straight now . Senator Root says this one triumph alone saves twenty million dollars a year to the business interests of the United States . I call that patriotism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lemon . THEODORE General Wood says it saves more human lives a year than were lost in the whole Spanish War ! I call it service . UNCLE EVERETT General Goethals says the Panama Canal could not have been built if it had not been for you fellows . JOHN In fact , scientists might well be called philanthropists ! ERNEST receiving cup from LUCY . Thanks . Better let it go at heroes and patriots . Philanthropists give dollars . Stirring tea . Never give a cent to charity myself . JOHN to others . I happen to know that Doctor Hamilton gave up a lucrative private practice to join the staff of the Baker Institute . ERNEST getting rather bored . Private practice did n't interest me . Drinks . The ones who deserve your praise are the ones who died to prove that theory . But I do n't suppose you ever even heard of ' em . JOHN standing right of table . Why , Doctor Hamilton ! Of course we 've heard of them . The fame of those four men is immortal . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men " happened to be a woman . Silence JOHN looks at THEODORE , who looks at LUCY , who looks at JUDGE . All uncomfortable . By the by , of course you all know their immortal names ? JOHN looks at THEODORE , who looks at LUCY , who looks at JUDGE . Same business . Then , if you do n't mind , cut out good-natured sneer " philanthropists " and make it scientists . Everybody knows the names of philanthropists . JUDGE coughs . Delicious tea . UNCLE EVERETT He 's right . Philanthropists do n't give their lives . They give their names . THEODORE standing . Ah , but that is what makes the sacrifices of scientists so beautiful  --  they do n't work for fame , they do n't work for money , they work for humanity . ERNEST with his quiet smile . I see that 's what Congress told us when we suggested a pension for one of the widows . Finishes his tea . THEODORE to ERNEST . Do you mean to say Congress refused to grant the pension ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JOHN How much ? ERNEST to JOHN . Seventeen dollars a month for the widow . Two dollars a month for each of the children . JOHN Is that all ? ERNEST returning cup , answers LUCY 's business of offering to fill it . No more , thanks  --  charming little farm you have out here . Rises and crosses to THEODORE . JOHN to JUDGE . Watch me . UNCLE EVERETT Oh ! I 'm watching you all the time . JOHN crosses to ERNEST . Approaching with a " Now watch me " manner . Doctor Hamilton  --  America kills its big scientists with routine , you are too valuable to the nation to lose  --  the trustees think you need a year abroad ! ERNEST Funny ! I was going to suggest that very thing . Somebody 's been rooting for me over in Paris  --  just had a letter from Metchnikoff himself  --  invites me to come and work a year in the Pasteur Institute . You did n't have to jolly me up to consent to that ! THEODORE lights his pipe here. p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ERNEST . By the by , my sister is rather keen on science . ERNEST businesslike . Turns back down centre . Best assistant I ever had . She 's over there already , so we can go right to work . JOHN coming down . Well  --  er  --  she 'll be back before you start . ERNEST stops short . I did n't know that . Looking from one to the other . A keen observer , he knows that JOHN is trying to do something , and is both amused and annoyed . To THEODORE . The others all watching . Oh , hell , what 's it all about ? THEODORE seated on the bench . Do n't you see , old chap , under the circumstances it would hardly do for her to go back to Paris with you ? ERNEST Why not ? LUCY You 're a man . ERNEST smiles . You mean I 'm dangerous . LUCY But she 's a woman . UNCLE EVERETT They mean she 's dangerous ! JOHN My dear fellow , we are going to ask you very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks about at the circle of anxious faces . So that 's it , eh ? But she needs it more than I do . She 's had so little chance to do original work . JOHN But she 's a woman . ERNEST impatiently . What of it ? JOHN Doctor Hamilton , we have the highest opinion of you , but one must respect the opinions of the world , you know . ERNEST thinks it over . That 's right , one must . I forgot to think of that . When you work with women of ability you learn to respect them so much that you quite lose the habit of insulting them . UNCLE EVERETT Too bad how new conditions spoil fine old customs . ERNEST Suppose we let her go , and I 'll stay . JOHN But I fear that would offend our generous benefactor . Mr. Baker has set his heart upon your going abroad for a year  --  winks at othersmeeting the big men over there , getting fresh ideas for our great humanitarian work . The family exchange glances as JOHN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accommodate you . She particularly desires to stay with us this winter . p. 52 ERNEST believes it . I did n't know that . I thought she did n't like you . JOHN Why else should she be returning so soon ? ERNEST Oh , I see . Well , I 'm sure I have no desire to drag her over with me . I thought but that 's all right ; if she does n't care to go with me , that settles it . JOHN You agree to go alone ? ERNEST Yes , alone . JOHN And we have your word on it ? ERNEST Certainly . JOHN How soon could you start ? ERNEST Soon as I get some one to run my department . JOHN Could my sister run it ? ERNEST Could she RUN it ? It ca n't run without her ! She 's a born executive . I hate that side of it . JOHN with a look at the others . Then that 's all fixed . Could you arrange to start on Monday 's steamer ? ERNEST hesitating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a triumphant glance at others , takes ERNEST 's arm and rushes him toward the door . Then come , we 'll telephone for your passage . The next train leaves directly after dinner . p. 53 ERNEST protesting . But  --  er  --  do n't you see  --  JOHN Of course I hate to cut short your week-end , but I take great interest in scientific careers JOHN rushes ERNEST off . THEODORE Well , John certainly did finesse it . LUCY Ca n't you see , you stupid MEN , Doctor Hamilton 's crazy about her , but thinks there 's no hope . UNCLE EVERETT sitting down . When she finds he 's leaving Monday for a year , her views about marriage may under-go a sudden change . THEODORE They were made for each other . They need a woman 's helping hand . Come , Lucy , now LUCY still seated behind table . Oh , I could manage it . See how I landed Rex , but John would kill me . UNCLE EVERETT John need n't know anything about it until too late . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . LUCY All right , we 'll get Helen and Doctor Hamilton together in some way , and after a decent interval we 'll excuse ourselves , leave them alone UNCLE EVERETT And let Nature take its course . p. 54 ERNEST as he re-enters . Well , I 'm sorry to have to run away like this after dinner UNCLE EVERETT Oh , er  --  where 's John ? Rising and going to ERNEST . ERNEST Waiting in his den for the long-distance telephone . UNCLE EVERETT Ahem ! We were just discussing the marriage danger  --  I mean the marriage problem . ERNEST Go right on , do n't mind me . THEODORE old-friend manner . See here , When are you ever going to get married ? ERNEST When am I ever going to get more than two thousand a year ? Pulling chair down stage and sitting at head of sofa . THEODORE Bah ! What has money got to do with it ? ERNEST Nothing  --  I do n't believe in marriage . UNCLE EVERETT I 've heard that before . THEODORE Just you wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do you know " the right one " has n't come already ? HELEN comes from the garden . She stands and looks at him , unseen by ERNEST . THEODORE sees her and smiles . She signals THEODORE , finger on lips , and tiptoes toward house. p. 55 THEODORE with a chuckle . Then do n't let her go by . ERNEST Oh , I could n't stop her , if I wanted to . HELEN is so interested that she stops . THEODORE Looks to me as if you could . ERNEST And what do YOU know about it ? THEODORE laughs . What 's the joke ? THEODORE still laughing . Ever try ? ERNEST To marry her ? Lord , no . Even if I did believe in marriage , I would n't marry that girl . HELEN is amazed and indignant . THEODORE Why not ? ERNEST She has n't any money . LUCY surprised . Well , really ! UNCLE EVERETT astonished . Good Lord ! HELEN is surprised . THEODORE straight . Money ! I did n't suppose you would marry for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl without money ? Most selfish thing a poor man can do . HELEN pantomimes applause , makes a moue at THEODORE , pantomimes " just what I said . " p. 56 THEODORE wagging his pipe at HELEN . Oh , you modern young people ! JUDGE and LUCY see HELEN . ERNEST Make her nothing but a superior servant in an inferior home . Not that girl . HELEN gives silent applause . THEODORE to ERNEST . Feministic nonsense ! To HELEN . The old-fashioned womanly woman ERNEST interrupts . Sentimental twaddle . Why more " womanly " to do menial work for men than intellectual work with them ? Twaddle , Theodore , twaddle ! HELEN gives silent applause , now enthusiastic . THEODORE All the same , if you really cared for a woman enough to marry her ERNEST But I do n't . THEODORE Then why run away to Paris just as she returns ? ERNEST Well , if you must know , you silly old idealist , I do n't believe in marriage , but , Theodore , she does . HELEN coming down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 57 ERNEST jumps up and retreats . My heavens ! Where did you drop from ? HELEN I dropped from Paris . Do n't be afraid , I agree with you perfectly . ERNEST going up to HELEN and shaking her hand . I 'm awfully glad to see you . HELEN And I 'm awfully glad to see you . ERNEST Do you know , I thought you believed in marriage . UNCLE EVERETT Wronged her . Apologize . HELEN And all this time I thought you did . UNCLE EVERETT Wronged him . Both apologize . HELEN with humor . Think of the discussions we might have had . UNCLE EVERETT Not too late yet . Your aunt Julia and I had discussions for twenty-five years . HELEN crossing to the right with ERNEST , humorously provoked with him . Why did n't you ever tell me ? ERNEST Why did n't you ever tell me ? UNCLE EVERETT Each understands the other now everything is lovely ! p. 58 HELEN indicating the others . Please do n't think I had any hand in this . Laughs . ERNEST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ? A plot to entrap us in marriage ! They want to throw me at your head . HELEN crosses to the tea-table , and busies herself with the tea things . Come ! Sit there ! We 'll have some fun with them . Indicating chair to the right of the table , in which ERNEST sits . THEODORE to JUDGE and LUCY  --  in a whisper . Shall we go now ? LUCY No , no ! too obvious ! HELEN leans toward ERNEST . Come , you must be attentive to me ; tell me all about anterior poliomyelitis . THEODORE , LUCY , JUDGE  --  all have their heads together . THEODORE The strangest courtship I ever saw . LUCY They ought to be spanked . UNCLE EVERETT Old Mother Nature will attend to that . With hand to his ear tries to hear what ERNEST and HELEN are saying . ERNEST and HELEN have heads together . I ca n't hear a damn word . p. 59 THEODORE They 're getting on famously . LUCY rises and crosses to ERNEST . If you 'll excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before dressing . We dine at eight . Going . ERNEST and HELEN exchange glances and smile . THEODORE whispers to JUDGE . Come on , Uncle Everett . UNCLE EVERETT Excuse me , Theodore  --  I want to be in at the death . THEODORE If you 'll excuse me , Ernest , I think I 'll have a look at the evening papers . He follows LUCY . HELEN seated behind table . Seriously , you ought n't to have dropped the polio experiments . ERNEST seated right of table . You ought n't to have dropped me right in the midst of the experiments . Those agar plates you were incubating all dried up and spoiled . You played the very devil with my data . UNCLE EVERETT on couch . God bless my soul , what are we coming to ? HELEN Oh , it 's perfectly proper for your little ears , uncle , only you ca n't understand a word of it. Wo n't any one play billiards with you ? And turns at once to ERNEST. p. 60 UNCLE EVERETT But I 'm fascinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Rises and goes up centre . HELEN seated behind table . To ERNEST . Oh , you have plenty of men assistants who can estimate antitoxin units . UNCLE EVERETT Estimate what ? ERNEST shakes his head . To HELEN . Men assistants lose interest . They are all so confoundedly ambitious to do original work . Why is it women can stand monotonous details better than men ? " The female of the species is more faithful than the male . " HELEN Because men have always made them tend the home ! UNCLE EVERETT coming behind the table and getting between the two . Ah , nothing like a good old-fashioned love-scene  --  in the scientific spirit . HELEN to JUDGE after pause . Uncle , dear ! Have n't you any tact ? Ca n't you see that he is paying me wonderful compliments ? Go and play Canfield in the library . UNCLE EVERETT Very well , I 'll leave you to your own devices  --  Keeps lingering up stage . But do n't forget the scientific spirit . p. 61 HELEN with animation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transition . Now I must tell you what Metchnikoff said about you and your great future . He said that if you will only let nothing interfere with your career  --  absolutely nothing  --  Significance . ERNEST pantomimes that JUDGE is listening  --  she proceeds , brisk and loud . He advises you to confine your original research to proving the absence of toxicity and antiphylaxis following the absorption of albumnosis and protiosis from the anteric mucosa . UNCLE EVERETT Help ! Help ! Running off . May God , your God , have mercy on your scientific souls . ERNEST different note , now they are alone . I wonder why they all take for granted that I want to make love to you ? HELEN avoids his eye . Well , you took for granted that I wanted you to . You are about the most conceited man I ever knew , and that 's saying a good deal . ERNEST How can I help it when you admire me so ? HELEN aroused . I ? Admire you ? ERNEST You 're always telling me what great things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me along . Why , if it had n't been for you , the so-called " Hamilton Antitoxin " would never have been discovered . And , after you left , everything went slump . Tell me , why did you leave me ? Was I rude to you ? Did I hurt your feelings ? p. 62 HELEN looks away . On the contrary , it was entirely out of respect for your feelings . ERNEST My feelings ? Oh , I see . You got it into your head that I wanted to marry you . Well , well . What an idea ! HELEN Men sometimes do . ERNEST looks at her . She is adorable . What of it ? . I suppose they do . HELEN It 's been known to happen . ERNEST looks away . I suppose it has. Well , you need n't be afraid . I 'll never ask you to marry me . HELEN You ca n't imagine what a weight this takes off my mind . ERNEST Yes . I feel as if a veil between us had been lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about those agar plates ? ERNEST What agar plates ? Oh , yes , yes , the polio experiments . Look , look , there 's a new moon . Looking off to the left . HELEN seriously . You promise never to mention the absurd subject again ? ERNEST What subject ? p. 63 HELEN Marriage . ERNEST with undue force . Oh , that . Certainly , I promise . He keeps eyes averted . HELEN turning to him with sudden change to girlish delight . Good ! Then  --  I 'll go to Paris with you ! ERNEST recoils suddenly . She misunderstands . Why , Doctor Metchnikoff  --  he promised me he 'd invite you ! ERNEST Yes , but you  --  you ca n't go . HELEN If you need me , I can . And you just said ERNEST But you must n't go to Paris with me . HELEN Do n't you want me with you ? ERNEST I thought you would like to stay at home and run the department for me ! HELEN hurt . Do n't you want me ? ERNEST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Stops . I am a man  --  you are a woman . HELEN What of it ? Contemptuously . Are you one of those small men who care what people say ? No . That 's not your reason . What is it ? Tell me. p. 64 ERNEST hesitates . It 's only for your sake . HELEN Then I 'm to be left behind like a child because you do n't care to be embarrassed with me . ERNEST It 's so unfair . I simply ca n't take you now . HELEN Oh . Very well , that 's settled then . Rises and goes down below the table . Go on to your wonderful career and leave me behind . Only I ca n't understand it . It 's not what I 'd do , that 's all . ERNEST rises . Oh . Please , please . HELEN Oh . I hate men . I hate you . ERNEST And I love you . HELEN to self more than to him . Oh . This spoils everything . ERNEST No ! It glorifies everything ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have loved you from the first day you came to my dreary old workroom . I did n't want you there . I did n't want any woman there . I tried to tire you out with overwork but could n't . I tried to drive you out , by rudeness , but you stayed . And that only made me love you more . Oh , I love you ! I love you ! HELEN breaks in . Do you ? Oh , do n't love me  --  ah , say it just once more . p. 65 ERNEST I love you ! I love you ! I love you ! I love everything about you  --  those wonderful brave eyes that face the naked facts of life and are not ashamed ; these beautiful hands that have worked so hard , so long , so close to mine , and not afraid , not afraid . HELEN Oh , do n't ! do n't ! I am afraid now . I made you say this . She smiles  --  though near to tears . I have always wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't . ERNEST Because you ca n't care enough ? HELEN Enough ? Too much ! ERNEST overwhelmed . You  --  love  --  me . He takes her in his arms . He laughs  --  then she laughs  --  both are embarrassed . HELEN It is because I loved you that I did n't want you to say it  --  only I did . It is because I loved you that I went abroad  --  to stay , only I could n't . I could n't stay away ! Oh , do you know how much I love you ? No !  --  you 're only a man ! ERNEST You darling  --  do you know how much I love you ? Every day there in the laboratory , when you in your apron , the apron I stole from your locker after you left  --  when you asked me for orders , did you never guess that I wanted to say " Love me ! " Every day when you took up your work , did you never feel how I wanted to take you up in my arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't you ? ERNEST Why did n't I ? How could I dare to hope that all this trembling loveliness could be just for me ? I never dreamed there could be women like you . I always thought women were merely something to be wanted and worshipped , petted , patronized , soft little things to be wooed and won , married and owned . But you HELEN looks front . Moves away to left a step . Helen , what 's wrong ? HELEN Married , Ernest ; we ca n't marry . ERNEST Ca n't marry  --  why ca n't we marry  --  Oh ! You mean your career  --  HELEN My career  --  what does that matter ? No , I mean yours ERNEST with a snap of his fingers . That for my career  --  you love me . You have been in my arms once  --  you and I can never forget that now . There 's no turning back . It 's all or nothing . Come to me ! She darts toward him , then stops . HELEN But , Ernest ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . ERNEST seizing her in man-fashion  --  he holds her fast@@ SCENE : Same as Act I. The next morning , Sunday . ERNEST and THEODORE are discovered at breakfast , at table down right centre . ERNEST does n't seem hungry and forgets to eat . THEODORE , enjoying his breakfast heartily , watches ERNEST out of the corner of his eye and smiles knowingly . THEODORE What 's the matter , old top ? No appetite this morning ? ERNEST is gazing at the door at right , and does n't hear . He is smoking a cigar . Expecting something , eh ? Why , of course , you were longing for codfish balls . Removes cover from plate and helps himself . ERNEST refuses the offered fish-ball , abstractedly shakes his head , and returns his gaze to the door . Oh , I know what you want . You want to go to church with me . ERNEST does n't hear . Their rector is ill . So I agreed to take the service this morning . No answer . Always the way when off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? No answer . THEODORE rises and walks around behind table and shouts in ERNEST 's ear . Is n't it ? ERNEST startled , jumps up . I beg your pardon . p. 68 THEODORE laughing . Oh . You 're hopeless . Crossing to centre . I ca n't stand people who talk so much at breakfast . ERNEST suddenly waking up . Wait a minute . Sit down . Have a cigarette . Offers cigarettes which are in a silver box on the table . Let 's talk about God . THEODORE , about to take cigarette , drops his hand . But I mean it . THEODORE takes cigarette . I 'd like to have a religion myself . THEODORE My dear boy , I never talk shop at the table . ERNEST laughs . You never talk shop at all , unless one wants it . That 's what I like about you , Theodore ; you button your collar behind , but you believe in those who button theirs in front . THEODORE I had an idea you took no stock in religion . Sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought  --  until  --  well , I 've made a discovery , old friend . Sits at right of table . THEODORE Oh . Another discovery ! Smiling . A scientific discovery ? p. 69 ERNEST not sentimentally . It makes all science look like a more machine . THEODORE Well , if you feel so strongly about it  --  better come to church , after all ! ERNEST I 'm not talking about the church  --  I 'm talking , about religion . THEODORE after surprise . You 're not talking about religion ; you 're talking about love  --  ERNEST Same thing , is n't it ? THEODORE amused . Well , I 'd hardly go that far ! ERNEST quietly . The divine fire that glorifies life and perpetuates it  --  the one eternal thing we mortals share with God  --  If that is n't religion , what is ? THEODORE smiles indulgently . Tell me , Theodore  --  you know , my father never allowed me to go to church when young , and since then I 've always worked on the holy Sabbath day smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human beings think there 's something carnal and wrong about sex ? THEODORE drops his eyes . ERNEST amused . I see " nice " people should drop their eyes even at the mention of the word . p. 70 THEODORE uncomfortably . Sex is a necessary evil , I admit , but ERNEST Evil ! The God-given impulse which accounts for you sitting there , for me sitting here ? The very heart and soul of life evil ! Really , Theodore , I do n't know much about religion , but that strikes me as blasphemy against the Creator ! THEODORE My dear boy , unlike the modern young person of eighteen , I have n't the relish for such subjects . I still feel outrageously reticent  --  a quaint heirloom from the Victorian age . But I think I may say that the church believed in marriage before science was born . ERNEST But why does the church keep on making women promise to " serve and obey " ? Why marry them with a ring ? It 's merely a link of the ancient chain smiles  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the days of financial force , made of gold . But still a chain , Theodore , still a chain . THEODORE Symbols , my dear fellow , not to be taken in a literal sense ; time-honored and beautiful symbols . ERNEST But why insult a woman you love even symbolically ? THEODORE with a laugh . Oh , you scientists ! Have you no idealism in your views ? p. 71 ERNEST I have n't any views . Science merely tries to find the truth , and the church  --  the church tries to hide it . THEODORE teasingly . Well , I know two young scientists who tried to hide the truth from each other and from themselves . And if I 'm not mistaken , the church helped to find it for them . Leans across the table . You may as well know , my boy , the whole family are on to you . Last evening after dinner when you took Helen for a walk in the moonlight , instead of taking the train for town , John threw fits all over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late did you two stay up ? I was in the library writing my sermon until half after one . You and Helen were still out here telling each other  --  well , about ANTERIOR POLIOMYELITIS ! ERNEST has scarcely heard THEODORE . Theodore , there 's one belief you and I have in common , one faith I 'll never doubt again  --  I belive in heaven now . THEODORE Why ? ERNEST Because I 've been there . Enter JOHN scowling . Good morning . JOHN grumpily rings bell , for breakfast . Could you spare me five minutes ? JOHN Have n't had breakfast yet . Picks newspaper from couch , sits down and reads paper . ERNEST looks at THEODORE and smiles  --  then rises and follows JOHN to centre. p. 72 ERNEST Oh , all right , after breakfast . JOHN I 've an appointment . ERNEST smiles . I 'll wait my turn . JOHN Going to be pretty busy to-day  --  you , too , I suppose , if you 're sailing to-morrow . Enter THOMAS . Breakfast , Thomas ! THOMAS signals the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast . He places it in centre , then picks up other table and leaves . THOMAS arranges chairs and brings couch down stage a little before he goes . ERNEST still agreeable . I can postpone sailing till next week . JOHN Must n't let anything interfere with your scientific career . LUCY as she enters . Good morning . ERNEST ignores JOHN , eagerly to LUCY . Could you tell me when she 'll be down ? JOHN overriding LUCY . My sister is ill and wo n't be down at all , until after you leave . LUCY shows discomfort . THEODORE tactfully turns to go . LUCY sits behind breakfast-table. p. 73 ERNEST crosses back to JOHN . Aroused at this snub , but controls himself and smiles . I do n't believe you quite understand . It 's merely as a conventional courtesy to you that I suggest and advise an interview . JOHN Do n't inconvenience yourself on my account . When I want your advice I 'll ask it . ERNEST shrugs shoulders . Oh , very well , do as you please . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wait , Theodore . Crosses up centre for his hat , which is on a small table , and looks at his watch . I think I 'll go to church after all  --  until my train leaves . THEODORE smoothing it over as he leaves . Come along I 'm going to preach about marriage ! ERNEST going , turns to LUCY , and bows urbanely . Thanks for all your kindness may I trouble you to have the valet pack my things ? I 'll call for them on the way to the station . Starts off , then stops and turns to JOHN . I have no favors to ask of you . You do n't own your sister  --  she owns herself . You might remember that . The scientist goes to church. p. 74 JOHN looks after ERNEST . Then sits at the table , with a loud laugh to show he does n't care  --  and turns to LUCY . Rather impertinent for a two-thousand-dollar man . Throws newspaper on table , turns to his grapefruit  --  LUCY says nothing  --  she pours his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing resentment . Got his nerve ! Seems to forget that I 'm a trustee of the Baker Institute . LUCY says nothing . JOHN tastes coffee , puts down cup violently and glares at LUCY . Cold again ! Eats grapefruit during following . Helen got her own way about going to college , going to work , going to live in her own apartment , but if she thinks she can marry that fellow LUCY cringes in dutiful silence as JOHN glares at her . Humph ! I 've got more influence with old man Baker than all the rest of the Board combined . I could get Hamilton fired , too , if I tried . LUCY pretends to be proud of her wonderful husband , like a true old-fashioned wife . Well , why do n't you say something ? LUCY startled . Why  --  why  --  I thought you did not like me to talk at breakfast , dear . She is frightened now  --  a worm that has never turned. p. 75 JOHN Think I like you to sit there like a mummy ? LUCY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's witticism , makes no reply . Does n't it ever occur to you that I 'd like my wife to be interesting ? No reply . JOHN starts to open and glance at letters during following . Not often  --  just once in a while  --  for a change . LUCY Nothing I say seems to interest you any more , dear . JOHN Well , is that my fault ? LUCY You do n't like me to discuss your business affairs , John . JOHN What do you know about business affairs ? LUCY What do you ever tell me ? JOHN Why should I tell you ? Suppose I want my wife to bother about money-making ? Your business is to spend it . Woman 's place is in the home . LUCY But , John , you 're never interested in what I do in the home  --  Oh , not that I blame you , but JOHN Well , why should I be ? How many roses were transplanted Monday ; what Cousin Margaret told you about the baby 's new tooth Tuesday . Humph ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the home p. 76 JOHN Bah ! Fads ! Fads ! One unwomanly female is enough for any family . LUCY Then , whatever you like , John , I 'll try ! JOHN opens second letter . I 'd like you to be just an old-fashioned wife , like my mother . LUCY the tragedy of her life is in this line , but both the suppressed yearning and the reproach should be conveyed , if at all , quietly . But I 'm not a mother . JOHN angered . It 's clearly an old sore subject . Crushes letter in his hand . If I 've told you once , I 've told you a hundred times ! You 're not to throw that up in my face . Have n't I given you everything else to make up for it ? And what do I get ? In season and out , when you speak and when you 're silent , when you look at me and when you look  --  it 's reproach , reproach , reproach , all my married life. For the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mail , opens the letter containing check . LUCY I 'm sorry , John . It 's only that  --  well , one finds it rather difficult to be an old-fashioned wife in a new-fashioned home . JOHN does not reply . Tense over a letter . Sudden change in manner . Have you a dressmaker named Charcot ? p. 77 LUCY Yes , John , this is one of Charcot 's  --  Indicating the dress she wears . Do you like it , dear ? JOHN holding letter . Did you have it charged in my name ? LUCY Why , John ! You know you never let me pay cash for anything . Every shoe-string is charged to you . JOHN significantly now . Do they ever overcharge me ? LUCY suddenly terrified , but controlling it . I suppose we all make mistakes at times . JOHN Yes , Thomas made a mistake this time . He put this letter among mine . It 's addressed to you . LUCY panting . Then give it to me . Reaches for letter . JOHN keeping it out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you first . Reads . " Dear Madam , enclosed please find check to your order for twenty-five dollars , being balance due from bill paid August Ist . " LUCY 's eyes down , she is twisting her napkin . You said nothing about their overcharging me when we went over the bills last month . p. 78 LUCY I never can understand business affairs . JOHN But the bill was paid by my secretary at my office . This check  --  holding it upis sent to my wife at my home . Why ? LUCY makes no reply . Lucy , how long has this been going on ? LUCY after a pause . The first time I ever tried it  --  and of course I 'm caught . JOHN growing wrath . So ! My own wife deliberately enters into a conspiracy with a vulgar little dressmaker to overcharge her husband so that she may obtain a rebate in cash ! Oh , Lucy , Lucy ! And all for twenty-five dollars . LUCY weeps . Who taught you this woman 's trick ? LUCY It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eh ? Half rises . Oho ! Jealousy surging up . Who is he ? LUCY cowers in silence , leaning across table . Are you going to tell me ? LUCY leaning back , nods . As soon as I get my courage up . JOHN rising . Quick ! His name . I 'll kill him . p. 79 LUCY surprisingly bold  --  sneers . Oh , no you wo n't ! JOHN The damned sneak  --  Goes down stage a step or two , then turns back . Who taught you this contemptible trick ? Answer me . LUCY You did . JOHN I ? What are you talking about ? LUCY Were n't you indicted and fined for entering into a conspiracy to take rebates from the railroads ? JOHN Lucy ! How dare you ? LUCY Well , that 's how I got the idea . JOHN crosses down right . How like a woman ! That was business . Why , at that time the biggest men in the country were indicted . LUCY Precisely . You told me at the time it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was , everybody did it . But to cheat your own husband . LUCY But it 's all right to cheat your own country . JOHN Bah ! At that time those fellows at Washington  --  they understood the country 's needs about as well as you do . LUCY And what do you know about my needs ? p. 80 JOHN Your needs ! That 's the limit ! Why , I give you everything ! Crosses back to table . You do n't have to raise a finger , you do n't even have to think for yourself . What more do you want ? To himself . Twenty-five dollars . LUCY Yes , twenty-five dollars . I wanted a little ready cash something I could call my own  --  spend as I pleased without first wheedling it out of you and then having you scowl over the bills . Oh , if men only knew how we loathe this begging and wheedling ! JOHN But do n't I give you everything money can buy ? LUCY But you never give me money to buy anything . JOHN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JOHN amazed , perplexed , sits again . A taxicab ? Have n't we cars enough ? LUCY I ca n't always take one of our cars when I go into town to shop  --  it 's too far . The day I bought this frock , Jean paid for the taxicab from the station  --  That 's why I asked her to go with me . You give her a regular allowance  --  you never give me a cent , if you can help it . Marjorie Hendricks paid for my luncheon . Why , I did n't even have a twenty-five-cent piece to tip the porter on the train or the girl in the restaurant cloakroom ; and oh , it 's so humiliating always to let one 's friends pay for everything . p. 81 JOHN a pause . Say , do you suppose Marjorie Hendricks and the others talk this over with their husbands ? LUCY I do n't know ; I do n't care ! JOHN Well , I do . See here , Lucy , I 'm going to forgive you tears up check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a regular montly allowance like Jean 's and you can spend it as you damn please . Nobody shall say I 'm a tightwad with my wife . Rises , crosses to right . LUCY I do n't want an allowance . JOHN crossing back to table again . You do n't want an allowance ! Then what do you want ? LUCY after a slight pause . I want to go . JOHN Go where ? When ? How long ? LUCY Now  --  any place  --  always . JOHN sits again . Picks up newspaper and starts to read . Oh , I guess not . This is just a sudden feminine whim . LUCY It 's been my constant thought ever since I married you . But  --  I never dared tell you till now . JOHN So you 'd like to leave me , would you ? Divorce ? LUCY nods yes . You have no grounds for divorce , my dear . p. 82 LUCY But you will have , after I leave you . JOHN You 've got no lover to leave with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  without anything horrid ? JOHN No money to desert with  --  Smiles . You do n't expect me to grant you that allowance on such terms ? LUCY I 'll earn my own living . JOHN You , you 've never been trained to earn money , only to spend it . Think of all the young women looking for work who are trained for it . You , you are n't even young ! LUCY You wo n't let me escape decently when I tell you I do n't care to stay ? When I tell you I ca n't stand being under the same roof with you ? When I tell you that I am sick risesin my soul of this life ! JOHN But , you see , I can stand it . I want you to stay . I am not sick of it . LUCY turns to him in disgust . In fact , when you look that way , you interest me . Throws newspaper over on couch . Rises and crosses to LUCY . LUCY shrinking from him . Do n't come near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerve myself to stand it . p. 83 JOHN Why , what 's suddenly got into you ? LUCY Suddenly ! Since the first . JOHN Good Lord , if I only gave you something to worry about ; if I ran after other women like old man Baker LUCY If you only would ! Then you would let me alone . JOHN Oh , I 'll buy you those pearls . Crosses in anger over to the right . LUCY indignant and infuriated by his lack of imagination . Pearls ! Ugh ! I 'm not your mistress to be bought with pearls ! JOHN shocked . Why , Lucy , you ought to be ashamed . Coming back to her . You are my wife . LUCY Yes , that 's the difference . If I were your mistress , I could get away . JOHN I forbid your saying such things . I forbid your even thinking such things ! LUCY By what right ? JOHN The right given me by law and religion . I am your lawful husband . Takes her in his arms . LUCY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws you men have made for women . p. 84 JOHN making free with her . I love you  --  despite everything . I want you and you belong to me . I 'll never let you go . LUCY But you do n't respect me , and I  --  I hate you ; oh , how I hate you . JOHN releasing LUCY , whispers . Now brace up ; what 's the use of letting others know ? Play the game . You must . LUCY Oh , I suppose so . I always do . What else can I do ? But day after day  --  day after day  --  ugh ! Enter the JUDGE , telegram in hand . LUCY and JOHN separate . UNCLE EVERETT enters in a very unhappy frame of mind . I never felt so blue in my life . Almost to himself . JOHN turning from LUCY . Another telegram from Aunt Julia ? Get them every day ? UNCLE EVERETT proudly . Yes , John , fresh every hour . What do you think 's happened ? Shows the telegram . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JOHN smiling . But why telegraph you about that ? p. 85 UNCLE EVERETT Got the habit of telling me her troubles  --  ca n't break it , even in Reno . JOHN signalling LUCY to play up . But you said she hated the theatre . UNCLE EVERETT She does , she does , but I 'm fond of it . Went for my sake  --  got the habit of sacrificing herself for my sake . Just as hard to break good habits as bad , John , just as hard . JOHN with a significant glance at LUCY . True women enjoy sacrificing themselves . LUCY crosses up to centre . UNCLE EVERETT Yes , that 's what we tell ' em . Well , we ought to know , John , we make ' em do it . Brings out fountain pen and sits abruptly on the couch . That 's what I 'll tell her . I can hear her laugh . Say , John  --  JOHN looks . You remember her laugh ? LUCY A telegraph blank ? UNCLE EVERETT with a humorous expression he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket . No , thanks , carry them with me nowadays . Begins to write . Wish I had n't sold my Western Union stock , John . JOHN I do n't think you want that divorce very much . p. 86 UNCLE EVERETT reprovingly as he begins to write . Does n't matter what I want  --  what she wants is the point . You should give the woman you marry tutti-frutti , divorces  --  everything Good heavens ! I believe I 've got the habit myself  --  and God knows I do n't enjoy sacrifice . I 'm a man ! The superior sex. JOHN I do n't believe you appreciate that wife of yours . UNCLE EVERETT between the words he 's writing . Do n't I ? It is n't every wife  --  that 'd travel away out to Reno  --  you know how she hates travelling  --  and go to a theatre  --  and catch a cold  --  and get a divorce  --  all for the sake of an uncongenial husband . I 'm proud of that woman . Suddenly getting an idea , strikes stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised all the windows in her bedroom  --  for my sake . I 'll give her the very devil for that  --  Writing . " How dare you leave the windows open in your bedroom when I 'm not there . " Pause  --  sentimentally . Poor little thing ! She does n't know how to take care of herself without me . Musing . I wonder if she ever will . JOHN as a servant enters . Thomas , send that telegram . p. 87 UNCLE EVERETT Wait till I sign it . Writes . " Ducky . " BUTLER takes telegram and goes . JOHN Uncle Everett , I want your advice . UNCLE EVERETT as if shocked . Oh , John , you want a divorce ? JOHN No , we are not that sort  --  are we , Lucy ? No answer . Are we , dear ? LUCY after a pause . No . We are not that sort . She turns away . JOHN We believe in the sanctity of the home , the holiness of marriage . LUCY The holiness of marriage . Turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small stand . JOHN goes up stage and sees JEAN and REX on the terrace . Oh . Here come Jean and Rex . Let 's give them a clear field . Love 's young dream , Uncle Everett . JUDGE rises and goes toward the door with JOHN . UNCLE EVERETT Hum . So you 've given that young scalawag your consent . You did n't bring up that little chorus-girl matter ? p. 88 JOHN Oh . That 's all fixed . No scandal , no blackmail . The old man fixed it . UNCLE EVERETT Old man Baker ? Well , that old reprobate ought to know how . As JOHN and JUDGE go out , JEAN and REX enter . JEAN coming down as if to go out . Good-by , Rex , I 'll see you at dinner . REX coming to centre , stopping JEAN before she can leave . But , what 's the matter , Jean ? You 've hardly said a word all through our ride . JEAN Rex , you were n't in love with me yesterday  --  you are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could ; but you ca n't , honorably . You 're a good sport and I admire you for that . REX Do you ? I ca n't say I admire myself very much , after what happened yesterday . I 've felt like a brute ever since . Of course you tried your best to prevent it  --  see what I mean ? you ran away from me . JEAN Do n't you know why I ran away ? to make you follow . I made you catch me . I made you kiss me . Then you realized that we had been thrown together constantly , purposely together , if you care to know it . REX Why , I never thought a woman could be capable of such honesty . Say , you are n't like the rest that have been shoved at me . Why , I can respect you . p. 89 JEAN Could you respect me if you knew that I let you propose to me yesterday , when I cared for some one else ? REX What 's that , Jean , some one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me  --  to him . REX Who is he ? why did n't you tell me ? JEAN I am telling you now . What have you ever told me about yourself ? REX angry , loud . You had no right to play fast and loose with me . JEAN agreeing , low . I 'm making the only amends I can . You are free , I tell you . REX with sudden desire , high . But I do n't want to be free . He ca n't have you . You are mine . If you think you can make me stop loving you JEAN interrupting , low . You do n't love me , Rex . You 're jealous . You 've never been in love with me . Let 's at least be honest about it . You merely want me now because you ca n't have me . REX frantic to possess what he can not have . You 're thinking of that other chap . You 're engaged to me and you stay engaged to me . I usually get what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted anything in my life ! I 'll win you from him yet . Enter HELEN from the house. p. 90 HELEN Oh , I beg your pardon . Lucy said John was out here . JEAN I 'll call him . She goes into the garden , running , glad to escape from REX . John ! John ! HELEN sits down . REX I 'll call him . He runs into the garden after JEAN . Jean ! Wait , Jean ! JOHN enters . He looks after REX and then comes down . He and HELEN take each other 's measure in smiling silence . JOHN pleasantly , but with gravity . You and I are n't going to quarrel , are we , Little Sister ? HELEN Depends on you , Big Brother . JOHN insisting on seriousness . Helen , dear , you are about to make the most momentous decision of your whole life . HELEN lightly . I 've already made it . And now I 'll tell you a-all about it . JOHN stopping her . Just a minute. I 'm afraid that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours practically , my dear . I know it all sounds very pretty in a story-book  --  " willing to sacrifice her career for love " and all that . But how about the man you love ? Want to sacrifice his career too ? p. 91 HELEN But I have no intention of sacrificing what you are pleased to call my career . And so he wo n't have to sacrifice his . All you have to do is to give me back my job . JOHN taken aback . What 's that ? HELEN I am absolutely indispensable to him . He is going to demand of the Board that I be reinstated . She looks determined . JOHN does too , but temporizes . JOHN Is Hamilton that sort ? Would he want the woman he loves to work ? She understands JOHN 's views , and smiles . HELEN He says the woman he loves is too good to loaf . Was n't it nice of him ? I think it 's one of the nicest things he ever said to me . He can not comprehend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with HELEN . That 's all very well in theory , but who 'll take care of your home when you 're at work and who 'll take care of your work when you 're at home ? Combine the two and you 'll fail at both . HELEN But suppose I stop working with him . JOHN But you could n't both live on his salary . What was it you said yesterday " needs every cent of his two thousand for books , travel , scientific conferences " p. 92 HELEN Then what do you want ? JOHN with force . I want you to show that you meant what you said . Invent some excuse to send him off to Paris at once . For the lives of little children , for the whole future of the race , sacrifice yourself ! Refuse to marry Ernest Hamilton . HELEN You need n't shout so , John . Places hand over JOHN 's mouth , then rises . I 've done it already . JOHN rises and follows her . What ! You have refused to marry him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . JOHN You give him up ? He 'll go to Paris alone ? HELEN directly , forcefully , but still amused . Give him up ? Never ! We 'll give up marriage but we wo n't give up each other . We 're sailing for Paris in the morning . JOHN springing back , almost screams . Without a marriage ceremony ? HELEN quietly . Of course . We never believed in it , anyway . JOHN What ! And this is my own sister ! Think what you 're saying . p. 93 HELEN I 've thought all night , John . You 've shown me how to say it . I agree with all you said . Marriage would destroy his usefulness , but so would separation . " Your great humanitarian work "  --  he needs me for that work  --  more than he needs a home . JOHN interrupting . But  --  but HELEN As you said : " Who would take care of my home when I 'm at work  --  who would take care of my work when I 'm at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can not have a home JOHN interrupting . But  --  I HELEN But did n't you say " For the lives of little children  --  for the whole future of the race , I must sacrifice myself  --  refuse to marry Ernest Hamilton " ? Well , John , I have followed your advice already . JOHN still gasping . But  --  but  --  why , I 'm not even shocked . Do you notice ? I 'm not even shocked . Because everything you have said , everything you have done  --  it all proves that you are a good woman . HELEN If I were a bad woman I 'd inveigle him into marriage . JOHN Inveigle ? Into marriage ? Are you joking ? p. 94 HELEN as if saying " calm yourself " . John , were n't you serious when you begged me not to marry him ? JOHN But this did you for one moment dream that I would consent to this sort of thing ? HELEN Not for one moment . I 'm not asking your consent  --  I 'm just telling you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She is not defiant , just determined and sweet . Bah ! All pose and poppycock ! Crosses and touches push-button on door-frame . I 'll soon put a stop to this nonsense . Muttering . Most ridiculous thing I ever heard of . HELEN John , I have n't told you half my reasons  --  only those you can understand , but nothing you can say , nothing you can do , will stop me now . JOHN We 'll see about that . Enter BUTLER . Ask the others to step out here at once  --  all except Miss Jean and Mr. Baker . I do n't want them . BUTLER bows and starts off . Is Doctor Hamilton about ? BUTLER No , sir , he 's gone to church . He goes out . JOHN To church ! My God ! HELEN pays no attention , looks straight out in front , head high , eyes clear and wide open . First of all , I 'm going to ask them to look you in the face . Then you can make this statement to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 95 HELEN dignity  --  force  --  conviction . John , if I were being forced into such a marriage as poor little Jean 's  --  if I led such a life as Lucy 's  --  I 'd be ashamed to look any one in the face ; but in the eyes of God who made love  --  no matter how I may appear in the eyes of man , who made marriage  --  I know that I am doing right . Enter LUCY followed by the JUDGE . JOHN not seeing them . Say that to Uncle Everett and Cousin Theodore , say that to my wife , stand up and say that to the world if you dare ! HELEN Certainly , I 'll say it now . To others , simply , quite cheerfully . JOHN turns and sees LUCY and JUDGE . John has convinced me practically of what I already believed theoretically about marriage , and I have made up my mind not to marry Doctor Hamilton . LUCY and JUDGE . What ! Turn to each other . JOHN takes HELEN by the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everett ! Lucy ! Look this girl in the eye . They do so . Go on , Helen . HELEN looking back at them . but as we need each other  --  in our work and in our life  --  why , we simply are going to have each other  --  always , until life is ended and our work is done , and that 's all there is to it . p. 96 JOHN That 's all there is to it ! UNCLE EVERETT That 's all there is to it ! JOHN laughing . Without a marriage ceremony ! Can you beat it ? LUCY Helen ! No ! LUCY almost faints and sits on sofa . JOHN Do n't you see through all this ? A bluff to gain my consent  --  a trick to get his salary raised . HELEN simply . No amount of money can induce me to marry Ernest Hamilton . I have too much self-respect . LUCY gasping . Too much ! JOHN Why , the whole thing is utterly absurd on the face of it . If she really meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and announce it in cold blood to her own family ? All turn and look at HELEN . Enter THEODORE from the left . HELEN with quiet scorn . Do you suppose I 'd run away without announcing it to my own family ? THEODORE coming down to HELEN  --  beaming . Announcing it ? Aha ! And what are you announcing , my dear ? All in a panic . JOHN gets behind the sofa. p. 97 LUCY Her engagement , Theodore , her engagement . UNCLE EVERETT crossing to centre . Exactly . John has suddenly seen a new light . JOHN louder . Helen has gained my full consent to marry Doctor Hamilton . I think most highly of him . UNCLE EVERETT apart . Yes , I thought you would . THEODORE delighted . And withal he has a deep religious nature . Congratulations , my dear ; he 'll make an ideal husband . Takes Helen 's hands , about to kiss her . HELEN ca n't help smiling . Thank you , Theodore , but I do n't want a husband and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other . A lovers ' quarrel ?  --  already ! UNCLE EVERETT enjoying it . No , Theodore , these lovers are in perfect accord ; they both have conscientious scruples against marriage . JOHN Conscientious ! UNCLE EVERETT So they are simply going to set up house-keeping without the mere formality of a wedding ceremony . THEODORE drops HELEN 's hands. p. 98 HELEN crosses to JUDGE . We are not going to do anything of the sort . THEODORE Shame , Uncle Everett , shame . HELEN We are not going to set up housekeeping at all . In Paris I 'll go back to that same nice little pension near the Luxembourg Gardens , and he 'll live near the Pasteur . We 'll work together and we 'll play together and we 'll take wonderful trips together . When we come back to America , he will keep his present quarters and I mine . But we wo n't have that daily binding , grinding prosaicness of married life together . UNCLE EVERETT There are worse things , Helen , even than marriage . HELEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what marriage will do for this man . I have n't played with him , I 've worked with him , and I know . THEODORE But if you love him , my dear , marriage brings together those who love each other truly . HELEN But those who love each other truly , do n't need anything to bring them together . The difficulty is to keep them apart . JOHN Oh , that 's all romantic rot . Every one feels that way when they are first married . HELEN First ? Then the object of marriage is not to bring together those who love each other , but to keep together those who do not . What a horrible thing marriage must be . p. 99 UNCLE EVERETT puzzled . Let me get that , will you ? Then understanding . Oh , you wish to be free to separate . Now I have it . HELEN To separate ? What a dreadful idea . Free to keep together . Marriage always puts people asunder . UNCLE EVERETT God bless my soul ! Apart to others . Always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not all people , uncle . She fondles JUDGE . I admit that you and dear Aunt Julia are happy together  --  you have so many tastes in common . UNCLE EVERETT apart . Tutti-frutti ! HELEN takes THEODORE 's arm and JUDGE 's . But look at most modern marriages . He goes down-town and works , she stays up-town and plays . He belongs to the laboring class , she to the leisure class . They think different thoughts , talk different languages , care for different things ; legally it 's union , but socially it 's a mesalliance , and in the eyes of God it must be something worse . To JUDGE . No wonder there 's one divorce to every ten marriages , uncle . UNCLE EVERETT Be logical , my dear , married first and divorced later . Be chronological , at least . p. 100 HELEN But you see I do n't want to be divorced  --  or married either . JOHN behind the sofa . Do you want to be disgraced ? During this bit of conversation THEODORE goes up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ostracized ? HELEN crosses to LUCY . Of course none of those costly well-kept wives on your visiting-list will call upon me . But so much the better ! Instead of one day at home like a lady , instead of making a tired husband work for me , I 'll have all my days free to work with him , like the true old-fashioned woman you all admire . JOHN bursts out . Oh , this is all nonsense . I tell you , whether you like it or not , you 've simply got to marry this fellow . LUCY Why , certainly . THEODORE You 've got to . HELEN I ca n't marry Ernest , I love him . THEODORE is astonished , the others throw up their hands , the BUTLER appears . BUTLER Doctor Hamilton is outside in a taxicab , sir . p. 101 JOHN Ha ! Show him here at once . BUTLER He says he does not care to come in , sir , unless you are ready to talk to him . JOHN Well , of all the nerve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LUCY comes down restraining JOHN . UNCLE EVERETT rising and coming to centre . Now , wait a minute , wait a minute . Restraining JOHN . Calmly to servant . Ask Doctor Hamilton kindly to wait in the library . The BUTLER goes . Now , we 're all a bit overwrought . Soothes HELEN , pats her hand , puts arm about her . I still believe in you , Helen . I still believe in him . To all . They both want to do right , but love has made them blind  --  blind to their own interests . He 's so absorbed in his great work for mankind that he does n't realize what he has asked Helen to do . HELEN ca n't help smiling as she puts in quietly . So I told him  --  when he asked me to marry him . JOHN What ? LUCY He asked you ? THEODORE coming down to right centre . To marry him ? p. 102 HELEN Of course ! So absorbed  --  not in mankind , uncle , but in me , that he  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . " LUCY utterly amazed . And you refused him ? The man who loves you honorably ? HELEN Of course ! All amazed , look at one another . You do n't suppose I 'd take advantage of the poor fellow 's weakness . JOHN And then he proposed this wicked substitute ! Poisoned her innocent mind  --  the bounder ! Going . I 'll HELEN interrupts , unexcitedly . But he did nothing of the sort . JOHN turning . Oh , your own idea , was it ? HELEN Of course ! All exchange looks . In justice to Ernest , I must tell you that in his heart he quite agrees with me about marriage , but he has a quaint mannish notion that I must be " protected " ! JOHN to others . But he 's willing to take advantage of the poor child 's ignorance  --  the cad ! To THEODORE . " Deep religious nature "  --  eh ? p. 103 THEODORE I ca n't believe it of Ernest . HELEN He knows nothing about it yet . JOHN stops . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since I refused to marry him . Sensation . The BUTLER returns . BUTLER Doctor Hamilton asks to see Miss Helen while waiting . HELEN crosses to the right . JOHN stops her . JOHN Just a minute , Helen  --  please . To LUCY . Hold her ! JOHN crosses to centre as HELEN goes up to the sofa with LUCY . Apart to JUDGE and THEODORE . We 've got to get him off to Paris at once . UNCLE EVERETT apart to JOHN . But you ca n't stop her following . John , she 's on the edge of the precipice  --  do n't shove her over ! Calmly to BUTLER , overriding JOHN . Tell Doctor Hamilton that Miss Helen will see him here . The BUTLER leaves . JOHN Are you crazy ? We 've got to keep ' em apart  --  our one chance to save her ! p. 104 UNCLE EVERETT No , bring them together . That is our one chance ! JOHN All the same , I 'm going round in front and keep an eye on that taxi . Starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because I know they are going to elope in it . UNCLE EVERETT They 're not going to elope . JOHN How do you know ? UNCLE EVERETT If they were going to elope they 'd elope first , and write you all about it later . Exit all except HELEN and LUCY , who lingers . LUCY has turned back to HELEN , as the others leave . Helen do you really mean to offer yourself on such terms to the man who loves you honorably ? HELEN Under the circumstances no other terms would be honorable  --  yes , Lucy , I 'm going to do it now . LUCY Then if you do he 'll never look at you again . Exit LUCY . ERNEST enters from the house and rushes down to HELEN eagerly . HELEN is seated on the sofa . She rises as ERNEST enters p. 105 HELEN Ernest ! ERNEST At last ! He takes her in his arms , she clings to him and gazes into his eyes , a long embrace . Tell me that you 're all right again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserted me , dear , just when I needed you most . ERNEST Deserted you ? Your brother said you were ill . HELEN Ah , I see shrugs he was mistaken . ERNEST But , never mind now , I 've got you at last , and I 'll never , never let you go . You 've got to sail with me to-morrow . Together ! Oh , think ! Together ! Another embrace . He is jubilant and boyish . HELEN Are you sure you love me ? ERNEST laughs from joy of her nearness . Am I sure ? Ten million times more to-day than yesterday . HELEN All the same , it can never be as I love you . ERNEST gaily , her hands in his . Then you can apologize . HELEN Apologize , for what ? ERNEST For saying , years and years ago  --  in other words , last night  --  that you did n't think you 'd marry me after all . She starts . Sits on sofa . Why , what 's the matter ? You are ill. p. 106 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HELEN on sofa . Then let 's get good old Theodore to marry us to-day . HELEN gazes at him . Still a few lingering doubts ? I had hoped a good night 's rest would put those little prejudices to sleep . HELEN Sleep ? Just gazes at him . ERNEST So you could n't sleep ? Neither could I , I was too happy to sleep . I was afraid I 'd miss some wondrous throbbing thought of your loveliness . Takes her passive hand , puts a kiss in it , and closes it reverently , while she looks on without moving . Do you know  --  smiling sighI 'm disappointed in love . I always thought it meant soft sighs and pretty speeches . It means agony , an agony of longing , delicious agony , but oh , terrific . She says nothing but gazes at him . HELEN Ernest . Rises . ERNEST also rises . It is n't easy for me to say this , but  --  I can not marry you , dear . ERNEST takes her in his arms . You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are helpless . So am I  --  In the clutch of forces more potent than our little selves  --  forces that brought us into the world . Forces that have made the world . Whether you will or no , this beautiful thing is sweeping you and me together . And you must yield . p. 107 HELEN Ah , my dear , could anything make it more beautiful than it is now ? ERNEST It is perfect . The one divine thing we share with God . The church is right in that respect . I used to look upon it as a mere contract . It 's a religious sacrament . HELEN Do the words repeated by a clergyman make it sacred ? ERNEST laughs . That mediaeval incantation ? No , love given by God  --  not the artificial form made by man . HELEN jubilant . Just what I said ! I knew you 'd agree . Steps back and offers her hand . Yes , I 'll go with you . ERNEST about to take her in his arms again . You darling ! HELEN stops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  perplexed . You mean a long pausewithout marriage ? HELEN I mean without marriage . They look into each other 's eyes ; neither blinks . ERNEST solemnly . A moment ago I thought I loved you as much as man could love woman . I was mistaken in you  --  I was mistaken in myself . I love you as man never loved before . With adoration . You wonderful woman ! p. 108 HELEN holds out her hand to be shaken , not to be caressed . Then you agree ? ERNEST takes her hand . Why , of course not ! You blessed girl , do n't you suppose I understand ? It 's all for my sake . Therefore , for your sake  --  no . Do you think I 'd let you do anything for anybody 's sake you 're sure later to regret ? HELEN Then do n't ask me to marry you , Ernest . We 'd both regret that later . It would destroy the two best things in life , the things that have brought us together , love and work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even marriage ! And , besides  --  think of our poor horrified families ! Think of the world 's view . HELEN Do you fear the world 's views ? ERNEST enfolding her . With you in my arms , I want nothing from heaven . I fear nothing from hell , but my dear shrugs and comes down to earth , with a smile , releasing herconsider the price . HELEN I am willing to pay it . ERNEST I am not willing to let you . HELEN getting away from him . You 'll have to be . I shall go with you on my terms or not at all . p. 109 ERNEST steps back . Emphatic . You will come with me as my wife or stay at home ! HELEN gasping . Now ? After all I 've said , all I 've done ? Ernest ! I 've told the family ! I took for granted why , Ernest ! You would n't , you could n't leaves me behind now . ERNEST Thanks to you and what you 've made of me , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts arms around his neck . ERNEST If you love me enough for that  --  taking her arms away I love you enough for this . Come when you 're ready to marry me . HELEN breaks out angry and injured . Do you think I 'll offer myself again on any terms ? Never ! ERNEST low . You must marry me , and you will ! HELEN You do n't know me . I will not ! ERNEST after a struggle . Then  --  I go alone . HELEN broken-hearted . No ! ERNEST Good-by ! ERNEST goes out . She waits motionless until she hears the automobile carrying him away . Immediately she turns from stone to tears , with a low wail . In utter despair , hands outstretched , she sinks down , and buries her face in her hands . LUCY , THEODORE , JUDGE , and JOHN hurry back all excited. p. 110 THEODORE enters first . Did you see the horrified look on Ernest 's face ? Going down . LUCY Revolted  --  running away from her . JOHN to HELEN . What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love of an honorable man . THEODORE Trampled on the finest feeling of a deep nature . JOHN You 've lost your chance to marry , you 've lost your chance to work  --  and now , by George , you 'll cut out independence , and stay at home where women belong  --  and live down this disgrace , if you can . LUCY With one excuse or another  --  he 'll stay away , he 'll never come back . HELEN He will , he will . He ca n't stay away . ERNEST enters rapidly , stops and takes in scene . No one sees him . JOHN He 'll never look at you again , and I do n't blame him . I 'm a man and I know . We do n't respect women who sell out so cheap . ERNEST You lie ! Coming down . All turn amazed . Helen ! HELEN Ernest ! He takes her in his arms . I knew you 'd come back . You will accept my terms . p. 111 ERNEST We 'll discuss that later . HELEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as I started , I saw in a flash all this . I knew what they 'd think . I knew what they 'd say . I knew they could not understand . JOHN Understand what ? If you respected this girl why did you run away ? ERNEST turning to JOHN . To protect her from myself . JOHN Then why come back ? ERNEST To protect her from you . Cowards , hypocrites , pharisees . JOHN advancing menacingly . By what right do you come into my home ? By what right do you take my sister in your arms ? UNCLE EVERETT gravely , judicially . Careful , John , careful . ERNEST By a right more ancient than man-made law . I have come to the cry of my mate . I 'm here to fight for the woman I love . Turning to JOHN , defying the world . My trip to Paris is postponed . One week from to-day gather all your family here , and we 'll make our declaration to the world . UNCLE EVERETT stepping down to JOHN . Play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you mean to marry her or not ? Speak my language . ERNEST She decides . Not you . He steps back and HELEN crosses to JOHN . HELEN No . No . No . JOHN to HELEN . Then you 'll go with this damned fanatic , only over my dead body . JOHN advances toward HELEN in rage . THEODORE and JUDGE cross between JOHN and HELEN , restraining him . HELEN high . And that will only tell the world the thing you wish to hide . ERNEST higher . There are laws to prevent marrying in some cases , but none to enforce it on women  --  unless they will it . JEAN enters from centre . Stops on hearing the following . JOHN Enforce ? Do you think I will ever allow a sister of mine to marry a libertine ? JEAN But I 'm not going to marry Rex . I 've just told him . My engagement is broken . General consternation . JEAN runs into the house sobbing . JOHN to LUCY . Great heavens . What next ? Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll never patch it up . Turning to ERNEST . As for you , you get right out of here . JUDGE goes up stage and sits , and remains there to the curtain , trying to think of some way out of the difficulty. p. 113 ERNEST stepping back a little . Oh , very well , this is your property . HELEN starts up . To JOHN . But I am not your property . I go , too . THEODORE Helen , do n't commit this sin . JOHN Let her go . A woman who will give herself to a man without marriage is no sister of mine . HELEN Give ? But if I sold myself as you are forcing poor little Jean to do  --  to a man she does not love , a libertine , who does not really love her  --  that is not sin . That is respectability . To entrap a man into marriage by playing the shameless tricks of the prostitute , that is " holy matrimony . " But to give yourself of your own free will to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  oh , if this is sin  --  then I will live and die a sinner . She turns to ERNEST , then bursts into tears on his shoulder , and , with his arms around her protectingly , they go out . JOHN in an awed tone . I did n't suppose she had the nerve . UNCLE EVERETT strong . You fool ! You drove her to this yourself . LUCY But what 'll we do , what 'll we do ? p. 114 UNCLE EVERETT to LUCY . Order your fastest car , your best chauffeur . Looks at watch . Quick ! Their train leaves in five minutes . LUCY rushes out . If I miss the train I 'll have to chase them all the way to town by motor . Buttons up coat to go . JOHN What 's the idea ? UNCLE EVERETT Idea ? They do n't want to do wrong  --  they want to do right . Going. @x SCENE : Same as Act II . It is early evening of the same busy day of rest . The draperies at right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark outside . The bracket-lamps over the mantel and the piano-lamp are lighted . Theodore is pacing up and down , shaking his head , glancing toward the door down right , when LUCY enters , also worried . He crosses to her eagerly , inquiringly . THEODORE Has n't Uncle Everett telephoned from town yet ? LUCY No , and he must have reached town long ago . THEODORE If Uncle Everett only had n't missed their train . LUCY If John only had n't lost his head , Uncle Everett might have brought them to their senses before they left . Oh , what will people say , what will people say ? THEODORE Calm yourself , Lucy , calm yourself . Has John come back ? LUCY No , John is still hunting for Rex . Rex disappeared as soon as Jean broke with him this morning , and no one has seen him since . THEODORE I wonder if he has looked for Rex on the links ? Shall I telephone over to the club ? p. 116 LUCY I 'll be so grateful to you if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from centre and goes down to LUCY . JOHN breathless and excited . Well , I found Rex . Over at the golf club . Terribly cut up , but listen , not a drink , not one . LUCY turns away from JOHN . Oh , Lord , what 's the matter now ? Ca n't you forget what happened this morning ? LUCY Forget ? JOHN Well , what good does it do to keep on talking about it ? LUCY Have I talked about it ? JOHN To keep on thinking about it , then . LUCY It 's hard not to think . JOHN But this is no time to think about yourself . What do your little troubles amount to ? Play the game . LUCY Have n't I played the game all day ? I will play it to the end . I have no alternative . JOHN We 've got to stick together now . The reputation of the whole family is at stake . We 've got to patch it up between Rex and Jean and we 've got to do it quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing JOHN 's voice. p. 117 LUCY No , and when the Bakers hear about Helen ! They 'll never let Rex marry into our family ! Never ! We 're disgraced , John , disgraced ! JOHN They 're not going to hear about Helen . No one knows , and no one will . LUCY But , John ! John , do n't you recall , just before they ran off , Doctor Hamilton threatened to announce it to the whole family next week ? JOHN Uncle Everett will attend to them . He 'll make them keep it dark . They 'll do that much for the family . THEODORE But if he does n't catch them ? JOHN Do n't be an ass ! I attended to that . When Uncle Everett missed their train this morning , I telephoned a detective to meet their train and follow them  --  to report to Uncle Everett when he arrived by motor . All fixed . THEODORE It 's bound to leak out in time . Why , if they both sail on the same steamer to-morrow  --  JOHN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jean is going to be married to Rex  --  and then we 're safe . See ? The Bakers will have to stand for us then . Everything now hangs on little Jean  --  our position in the world , my business relations with the old man  --  everything . To LUCY . Tell her I 've got to see her at once. Hurry ! Rex is coming to see her later . He 's gone to get his father 's approval . LUCY stops. p. 118 LUCY But will he give it ? JOHN Go on  --  I fixed the old man long ago . LUCY All right , I 'll get Jean . LUCY goes out . THEODORE crosses as if to follow LUCY , but stops and calls to JOHN . John , you 're not going to put it up to Jean to go in for that sort of a marriage . You 're too good a fellow . JOHN Have n't I done everything in the world to please my sisters ? Ca n't they even marry to please me ? THEODORE But not Rex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But you ca n't . You have nothing to do with it  --  except to perform the ceremony and get a big fat fee . THEODORE I  --  marry Jean and Rex ? JOHN pacing and thinking about JEAN . Oh , you think you wo n't , but you will . JOHN goes up to door . JEAN enters from the house . She looks frightened , runs to THEODORE for protection . THEODORE puts arm about her , pats shoulder . THEODORE There , there , my dear , do n't cry any more . I 'm on your side . JEAN cries on THEODORE 's shoulder . Now , now , now ! John 's got a rough outside , but the kindest heart in the world . I 've found that out for myself . p. 119 JOHN gently . Jean , we must n't detain Theodore . He has an important business letter to write . THEODORE to JOHN . No , I have n't . JOHN Yes , you have . THEODORE turns to JOHN in surprise . Your wife 's sanitarium bills  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you again . THEODORE Oh , that 's the idea ; with your money ? Takes JOHN 's check out of pocket , about to tear it . JOHN catching THEODORE 's hand . Want to kill your wife ? Then take her out of the sanitarium . Want to ruin your children ? Then take them out of school . Cash that check , I tell you , and pay your debts . THEODORE glances at JEAN , at check  --  a struggle . At bay , he finally pockets the check and goes out . JEAN turns to JOHN , with crumpled handkerchief in hand . Well ? You ca n't force me to marry Rex . So what are you going to do about it ? Cut off my allowance or merely bully me to death ? JOHN kindly . Oh , come ! You 've filled your romantic little head full of novels . I never force anybody to do anything . JEAN looks at him in surprise . JOHN suddenly breaks out . My heavens ! What 's the matter with this family anyway ? Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have got money ! p. 120 JEAN Rex has money , too . Should that give him the right to women ? I , too , have some rights  --  even though I am a woman . JOHN Well , if you expect to find a saint , you 'll never get married at all . JEAN And if I never married at all ? Then what ? JOHN Yes ! Then what ? JEAN Oh , it 's so unfair  --  you would n't allow me to go to college  --  you would n't allow me to learn a profession  --  oh ! I wish I could earn my own living . I envy Helen so . JOHN Helen ? bah ! You do n't know what you 're saying . If you do n't marry Rex now , you 'll never have a chance to marry anybody . Now think before it 's too late . Think what it means to be a dependent old maid . JEAN It is n't fair to train girls only for this . To live on the charity of a disapproving brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice have I ? JOHN There you are . REX enters . JOHN sees him and goes up to him . As JEAN crosses the stage , not seeing REX , but sobbing with her face in her hands , JOHN pantomimes and whispers to REX . It 's all right . JOHN goes out . REX steals down upon JEAN unawares , and taking her in his arms , kisses her. p. 121 JEAN indignant , struggles , frees herself and rubs her cheek . Ugh ! How could you ! REX Because I love you . JEAN Love ! It is n't even respect now . REX Has that chap at Harvard ever kissed you ? JEAN shuddering . I have begged you never to refer to him again . REX becoming more jealous . He has ! He has held you in his arms . He has kissed your lips . JEAN How many women have you held in your arms ? Have I ever tried to find out ? REX Ah ! You do n't deny it , you ca n't . JEAN I can ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but he does . REX Thank heavens . You do n't know how this has tormented me , little Jean . The thought of any other man 's coming near you  --  JEAN biting lips  --  then deliberatly whirls around to him . . Well , then , other men have come near me  --  other men have kissed me . REX getting wild again . What ! When ? Where ? p. 122 JEAN laughing cynically . Oh , conservatories in town  --  John 's camp in the North Woods , motor rides in the country  --  once or twice out here on this very spot when I felt sentimental in the moonlight . REX Oh , Jean ! I never supposed you were that sort ! JEAN with distaste . Oh , I do n't make a habit of it ! I 'm not that sort . I 've merely been handled , not hurt . Slightly shop-worn , but as good as new . REX Oh , stop ! If you 're not going to marry me , say so . JEAN But I am ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all my life . REX , nonplussed , only gazes at her . But first , I want you to know exactly what you 're getting for your money . That seems only businesslike . REX recoils . Would you marry me only for that ? JEAN I told you I loved another man . Do you still want me ? REX with jealousy returning . Do I want you ! Seizes her passionately . I 'll make you love me ! Kisses her triumphantly . I 'll bring a different light into those cold eyes of yours . Wait until you 're married ! I 'll make you forget that man , all other men . You are mine , all mine . JEAN remains passive . Ca n't you love me a little ? Have n't you any sentiment in your cynical little soul ? p. 123 JEAN In my soul ? Yes , but must I sell my soul too ? REX Look out , here comes the parson . THEODORE re-enters from the house . REX retreats . JEAN cynical , rapid , gay , reckless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come to an understanding . Will you solemnize our blessed union ? THEODORE surprised and grieved . Stern . No , not unless you truly love each other . Marriage is sacred . JEAN rapidly . A large church wedding  --  that will make it sacred . A full choral service  --  many expensive flowers  --  all the smartest people invited  --  that always makes the union of two souls sacred . THEODORE My dear child , when two people love each other , their friends should witness the solemn rites JEAN interrupts  --  to REX . And my wedding-gown will be white satin with a point-lace veil caught up with orange-blossoms , and a diamond tiara  --  " the gift of the groom . " That will make it solemn . THEODORE The white veil is the symbol of purity , Jean . JEAN Of purity , Rex , do you hear ? Whenever you see a bride in the white symbol of purity she is pure  --  that proves it . That makes it all so sacred . So holy ! As she goes to the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he follows her . Stop ! I command you to stop . JOHN enters . You shall not marry that woman . JOHN That 's all right , Rex , I 'll take care of him . REX crosses THEODORE and leaves . THEODORE to JOHN . I warn you  --  I 'll prevent this marriage ! I 'll tell every clergyman in the diocese . I 'll inform the bishop himself . Such a marriage would be sacrilege . JOHN voice trembling with rage . You dare threaten me ! After all I 've done for you ? THEODORE excited . Your five thousand was a loan  --  not all bribe  --  every cent of it will be returned . JOHN You ca n't return it , I would n't let you if you could . Calms down . Come , it 's all in the family . We 've all got to stand together now . THEODORE shakes his head . Say , you know the Gothic chapel old man Baker is building on his estate  --  he likes you , Theodore ; I 'll tell him you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not . He told me this morning after service that he was looking for a " safe and sane " man. p. 125 JOHN Oh , he need n't know anything about those radical views of yours . THEODORE But I 'd know  --  that I was preaching one thing while believing another ; praising the easy generosity of the rich when I know the awful sufferings of the poor  --  advocating charity while I long to fight for justice . JOHN Oh , there are plenty of other things to preach about . Come , do n't be an idiot . I can land that job for you . THEODORE Do n't trouble yourself . Mr. Baker offered it to me this morning . JOHN What ! You did n't refuse a chance like that ? THEODORE Do you think I want to live on that old hypocrite 's money ? JOHN losing all patience with him . Then how do you expect to live ? On your relatives ? THEODORE insulted . I never asked your aid . JOHN But you took it ? THEODORE I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , but just now , out here , when you showed me what it meant to be in debt to you , I reconsidered . I telephoned Mr. Baker John , I 've landed " the job . " JOHN rises and goes to THEODORE and smiles at him cynically. p. 126 JOHN I thought you did n't want to live on that old hypocrite 's money ? THEODORE Want to ? Do you think I 'm doing this for myself ! I 'm doing it to keep my wife alive . To keep my children out of the streets . To keep myself out of deeper debt to you . That 's why many a man sells his soul to the devil . If I had only myself to consider  --  why , John , to me a little thing like death would be a blessed luxury . Pause . But I can not afford  --  even to die . I must compromise and live  --  live for those dependent on me . JOHN But you 're going to marry Jean and Rex all the same . THEODORE You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer . JOHN Theodore , money talks in this world  --  louder than the church . Refuse to marry Baker 's son and how long will you keep Baker 's Chapel ?  --  Think it over , Theodore , you 'll be fixed for life . THEODORE staggered . John  --  you 're right  --  Yes ! I 'll be fixed for life . Fixed for life . UNCLE EVERETT off stage . John ! Where 's John ? The JUDGE suddenly enters in motor clothes covered with dust , followed excitedly by LUCY . The JUDGE is panting and running. p. 127 LUCY But Uncle Everett ! Uncle Everett ! Could n't you find them ? JOHN Will they keep it dark ? LUCY Where did they go  --  quick ! UNCLE EVERETT panting . Just give me time to get my breath . Fans himself with hat , pants , and mops his brow . JOHN My detective  --  did n't he meet their train ? JUDGE nods yes . LUCY But they saw him first ? JUDGE shakes head no . JOHN Did n't he follow them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOHN Speak , man , speak ! UNCLE EVERETT raises his hands , holding his hat and handkerchief . Now , just give me a chance and I 'll tell the whole story. The detective was waiting at the station . He saw them step out of the train  --  watched them get into a taxi  --  jumped into another himself  --  and followed them  --  Even now they do n't know they were watched  --  or  --  pauses , shakes headthey might have taken another course . p. 128 LUCY Quick , tell us the worst . UNCLE EVERETT hesitates . Well they drove straight to Helen 's apartment . JOHN all horrified  --  heads shaking . To Helen 's apartment ! Oh ! LUCY And you were too late ! To THEODORE . What did I tell you ? JOHN But my detective ? UNCLE EVERETT He followed and reported to me when I reached town . LUCY Reported what ? Tell us all . UNCLE EVERETT First he saw Ernest help Helen out of the taxi  --  very tenderly , like this . Pantomimes helping a lady out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they never dreamed how every detail was to be reported to you . JOHN impatient . Go on ! Go on ! UNCLE EVERETT Then the detective saw Ernest deliberately LUCY interjecting . Yes , go on . UNCLE EVERETT Deliberately lift his hat removes hatlike that , say good afternoon , and drive on to his own apartment a mile away . Turns up stage  --  removes coat and hat  --  places them on sofa . There is a sudden silence , the others waiting. p. 129 LUCY Oh , is that all ? They exchange glances . LUCY seems somehow disappointed . JOHN exasperated by JUDGE 's fooling . But where are they now ? JUDGE drops his eyes , business of hating to tell . Quick , man , speak . LUCY They met later ! JUDGE nods . I knew it . UNCLE EVERETT They are alone together at this very moment ! ALL excited . Where ? Where ? UNCLE EVERETT pointing to the house . There . Takes out cigarcase and smiles  --  and sits on sofa . ALL amazed . What ? JOHN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clipping cigar . Waiting to receive your blessing . JOHN My blessing ? Almost simultaneously LUCY Married ? THEODORE down left . Already ! p. 130 JOHN Hurray ! JOHN slaps JUDGE on the back with joyous relief , knocking cigar out of his hand . During following JUDGE tries to speak but they give him no chance . JOHN Cold feet  --  he saw it would n't pay . Together LUCY The disgrace  --  she could n't face it . THEODORE A deep religious nature  --  I said so all along . Then turning to JUDGE again . JOHN How 'd you work it ? Rapidly , laughingly , almost simultaneously LUCY Tell us all about it . THEODORE Who married them ? UNCLE EVERETT having a chance at last . Married If you only would n't interrupt  --  They are n't dreaming of marriage ! ALL What ! UNCLE EVERETT Helen has a worse opinion of holy matrimony now than ever. All three in despair again . THEODORE groans , LUCY throws up her hands , JOHN starts indignantly toward terrace  --  then stops bewildered. p. 131 JOHN But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how on earth did you get ' em back ? UNCLE EVERETT seated on sofa smoking calmly . Oh , perfectly simple ! Promised Helen you 'd apologize to Ernest , promised Ernest you 'd apologize to Helen . Theodore , go tell them John 's ready . JOHN Apologize  --  I ? UNCLE EVERETT Of course you will  --  and I promised both we 'd arrange a nice little family party for them . JOHN A family party ? LUCY For them ? THEODORE Why ? UNCLE EVERETT To spread the glad tidings that they 're not going to marry  --  merely going to Paris . JOHN higher . See here . Are you crazy ? Are they crazy ? Do you think I 'm crazy ? UNCLE EVERETT Well , do n't jump on me . You did your best to make them crazy , but they indignantly decline to run away together until after they make a formal announcement to the whole damn family . Theodore , Helen 's got a million new arguments against marriage , and if you do n't hurry , she 'll tell them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family here for that ? p. 132 JOHN We 'll do nothing of the sort ! UNCLE EVERETT You do n't have to . I have invited them already . They 're coming for dinner this evening . LUCY This evening ! JOHN You invited the family ! UNCLE EVERETT nodding . I had your detective send out an S. O. S. call by telephone . JOHN crosses down left . You think you 're very funny , do n't you ? But that 's my own sister in there planning to be that fellow 's mistress  --  right here in my own home  --  anything funny about that ? UNCLE EVERETT flicks cigar-ashes . Oh , well , if you do n't like your sister to be that fellow 's mistress , as you call it , why do n't you put a stop to it ? JOHN turns . You bet I will ! UNCLE EVERETT stopping JOHN with voice . How are you going to stop it , John ? JOHN hesitates . Kick them out of your home again ? Stopping JOHN again . Think they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . John , you 're up against it . I know it pains you to think , but sometimes it 's necessary . Women like Helen are a new proposition to men like you . Maybe you can force Jean into marriage  --  with a man she does n't love . She is the old-fashioned girl . But Helen  --  you ca n't force Helen into marriage , even with the man she does love . She 's the New Woman . We 're at the dawn of a new era , John ; women are going to do what they belive is right , not what we men tell ' em to believe is right . What are you going to do about it ? JOHN is silent . Nothing . I thought so . Call ' em bad and let it go at that . Blame it all on human nature , made by God , and leave unchanged all human institutions , made by man . But I tell you right now , unless we change the rules and regulations of the game , marriage is doomed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now breaks out . All right , all right , but we ca n't alter marriage overnight , just to suit Helen  --  what are you going to do about it ? UNCLE EVERETT There 's only one thing to do now . They did n't have to come back , if they did n't want to , did they ? All assent . You do n't deserve it , if you ask me . Why , they 're the kindest , truest , noblest pair of lovers I ever knew . THEODORE Uncle Everett , would you call immorality noble , exactly ? UNCLE EVERETT Have they done anything immoral ? THEODORE Not yet , but UNCLE EVERETT Well , they wo n't either , if we work it right . JOHN What are you going to do ? UNCLE EVERETT Will you back me up in everything I do , anything I say ? JOHN Everything . Anything . UNCLE EVERETT Then tell them they do n't have to marry ! THEODORE What 's that ? JOHN Do n't have to marry ! THEODORE You do n't expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 134 UNCLE EVERETT No , but I expect you to pretend to do so . All draw around him . THEODORE How do you mean ? JOHN What 's the idea ? UNCLE EVERETT If we pretend we do n't want them to marry , then they 'll want to marry . John , when you want your dog to come in out of the rain and be happy , how does he invariably behave when you try to drag him in by the collar ? Balks , does n't he ? Just let him alone and he will trot right in of his own accord and wag his tail . The others nod understandingly . We 've been fighting these young idealists , so naturally they fought back . Just let them alone and they 'll come to their senses . They 're not fools . And they 've done a lot of thinking since you saw them last . Now just follow my lead and you 'll see . Keep your eye on your uncle Everett . Goes up and calls off to the right . Oh , Helen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we must be nice to them . THEODORE After all , they 've done nothing wrong . We misjudged them . HELEN enters first , then ERNEST . LUCY in a low voice , and quickly . Now , John , be nice . p. 135 HELEN Well , John ? JOHN opens his arms magnanimously . JOHN My sister ! All is forgiven ! HELEN stops short , her lips curl . You forgive me ? ERNEST faces JOHN . You forgive her ? For what ? JOHN Did n't my sister run away with you ? Under the circumstances was n't it natural for us to think that  --  that  --  ERNEST to JOHN . You evil-minded married people ! How dare you judge us by yourselves ! Turns to HELEN . JOHN apart , gasping . Well , I 'll be damned ! UNCLE EVERETT whispers . Stand for it , John he 's right . THEODORE But , Ernest , I 'm bound to say when two people run away together  --  ERNEST pityingly disgusted . Oh , Theodore , not you , too ! Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did we want to " run away , " as you call it ? To all . Did n't I distinctly state that we 'd wait a full week to give this question calm consideration ? That at the end of that week our final decision would first have to be announced before the whole family ? Could language have been clearer ? Turns to JOHN and sneers . But this absurd person  --  what did he do ? Ordered us off his property like poachers . What could we do ? Sit down in the road and wait a week ? Bah ! You suspicious married people . You hypocritical , unspeakable married people ! JOHN starts in anger toward ERNEST . JUDGE stops him and crosses to ERNEST at right centre. p. 136 UNCLE EVERETT Oh , now , wait a minute  --  do n't be hard on them , Ernest . John wants to apologize to you . ERNEST turns to HELEN , and JUDGE forces JOHN over to ERNEST to apologize . JOHN to ERNEST , angrily . I apologize ! He then goes up centre . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THEODORE We all do , Ernest , we all do . Crosses to ERNEST and then joins JOHN and LUCY up stage . ERNEST to JOHN , THEODORE , and LUCY . Not to me to her . It does n't matter about me , but UNCLE EVERETT Do it all over again , if he wants you to . Pushing THEODORE over to HELEN , who is still standing . THEODORE coming down to HELEN . Why , certainly , Helen , I apologize most humbly . LUCY kissing HELEN . My dear ! Of course Passes HELEN over to JOHN and crosses to THEODORE. p. 137 JOHN JUDGE forces JOHN down to HELEN . My sister , forgive me . Crosses to LUCY and THEODORE . UNCLE EVERETT to ERNEST over L. There  --  I told you they would . ERNEST coming to L C. Then I 'm going . That 's all I came back for . Now , then , one week from to-day gather all your family here and we 'll announce our decision . HELEN crosses and joins ERNEST . They start up . JUDGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , wait a minute , wait . I 've got some good news for you . To both . I 've talked the whole thing over with John and Lucy and Theodore and I find they agree with all you say about marriage . Your arguments are unanswerable  --  we all advise you to try this conscientious experiment . HELEN What ? ERNEST What 's this ? Lovers exchange glances during following . UNCLE EVERETT Why , we would n't let a little thing like matrimony come between them for the world , would we , Theodore ? p. 138 THEODORE Those who love each other truly do n't need anything to bring them together . UNCLE EVERETT John , how do you feel ? JOHN How do I feel  --  Pounces on JUDGE , who retreats a step . UNCLE EVERETT Do n't raise your voice . I 'm nervous . JOHN recovers , swallows . " Marriage always puts people asunder . " Goes up to mantel . UNCLE EVERETT to LUCY . You agree , do n't you , Lucy ? LUCY to HELEN . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UNCLE EVERETT Exactly . Too much self-respect . HELEN laughs and turns to JUDGE . I do n't know what you are up to , you dear old fraud , but we do n't belive a word of it . UNCLE EVERETT You wait and see . HELEN to LUCY , JOHN , and THEODORE . Very well , then , if you really mean it , you will invite the whole family here a week from to-day . ERNEST That was our stipulation  --  a week from today . p. 139 LUCY They 'll be here in half an hour . HELEN taken aback , recoils . In half an hour . ERNEST But we said in a week . UNCLE EVERETT A little surprise-party . JOHN Why wait ? Begin your new life together this evening . UNCLE EVERETT Is n't it all lovely ? HELEN But  --  but  --  that 's so sudden . ERNEST We we are n't ready . THEODORE You 're just as ready as you 'll ever be . UNCLE EVERETT And the family dinner this evening , your  --  in a manner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objections . Now it 's all fixed , let 's go and dress for the  --  as it were  --  ceremony . LUCY , JOHN , THEODORE , and JUDGE start to go out . JUDGE leads the way , speaking apart to the others . When it comes to the scratch , you 'll see . Almost off . ERNEST Wait ! Judge Grey ! All stop , turn , exchange glances . Did I ever say I would not marry Helen ? p. 140 UNCLE EVERETT What did I tell you ? To JOHN , LUCY , and THEODORE . JOHN Ah ! so you 'd like to marry my sister after all ? ERNEST turning to JOHN . What have I been doing for the past twenty-four hours ? Begging her to marry me . What have you been doing ? Preventing it . Why did I postpone sailing for a week ? Why did I insist upon a family gathering ? Oh , you 're such an ass . UNCLE EVERETT coming behind JOHN and holding him as he starts for ERNEST . Stand for it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a brother in-law . JUDGE sits on the sofa . JOHN controls self  --  to ERNEST . Well , I  --  I  --  you have my consent . ERNEST Your consent ? What 's that got to do with it ? JOHN starts for him again . Now wait ! This morning you tried bullying . Did that work ? And now bluffing . Think that will work ? You ca n't frighten this glorious girl into marriage . I 've tried that myself . If you want this woman to marry , prove the morality of marriage . THEODORE The morality of marriage ! What next ? p. 141 ERNEST to THEODORE . That 's what I said  --  the morality of marriage . To all . This woman is not on trial before you . Marriage is on trial before her , and thus far you 've made out a rotten case for it . Simply justify Helen 's marrying me , and  --  to THEODOREI give you my word , you can perform the ceremony this very evening . No license is required in this State , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be fairer than that ! To HELEN . You agree , Helen ? Rises and goes down stage a little . HELEN Ernest and I agree in everything . But why should I contract by law for what is better done by love ? What 's the sense ? THEODORE Perfectly simple  --  I will leave out the promise to obey . HELEN But the promise to love . THEODORE Well , no , we can hardly leave that out , my dear . HELEN But what right has Ernest in his present state of emotional irresponsibility to promise to go on loving me ? Look at him ! JOHN Yes , look at him ! The idiot ! JUDGE goes back to sofa and sits. p. 142 THEODORE My dear Helen , are you so cold , so scientific , so unsexed as not to trust the man you love ? HELEN Trust ? Contracts are not for those who trust . They 're for those who do n't . Why , if I could n't trust Ernest  --  she turns to him I 'd be terribly tempted to marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the plain , every-day , practical question is  --  if you do n't marry him , how long would he keep his job in the Institute ? Old man Baker 's views happen to be old-fashioned . ERNEST Baker ? Every one knows Baker 's public views and private practices . Even the church knows and pretends not to , like his wife . HELEN The church , like his wife , needs his support . THEODORE weakly . At least , Mr. Baker does not parade his sin in public . ERNEST more sarcastic . Oh , now we have it ; a sin to be honest , but moral to be a hypocrite . HELEN Why , Theodore ! You defend Mr. Baker ! What has got into you ? ERNEST to HELEN , half-seriously . I 'm beginning to believe you 're right , after all ! If I learn much more about morality  --  I 'll withdraw my offer of marriage and ask your pardon for making it . p. 143 JOHN ca n't stand it . And then I 'll withdraw my offer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EVERETT rises . There he goes  --  My God ! Throws up hands in despair . ERNEST angered , to JOHN . You can have it now ! I do n't need the support of church pillars . JOHN Then how 'll you get your bread and butter ? Private practice ? No respectable home will let you inside the door ! ERNEST more angry . I 've seen quite enough of " respectable homes . " Takes a cablegram from pocket . This morning I came to ask for your sister 's hand in marriage . Your manners were very bad . So I cabled over to Metchnikoff . Hands cablegram to JOHN . Here 's the answer . Positions await us both at the Pasteur Institute in Paris . JOHN glances at cablegram and returns it to ERNEST . JOHN excited , rapidly but beaten . Doctor Hamilton , you 're a man of the world . You know what this means ; she does n't . She is in your power . For God 's sake , go to Paris without her . ERNEST What ! Leave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her out of her job . You 'd force her into legalized prostitution , if you could , like her innocent little sister . No , married or not , she sails with me in the morning . That 's final . Come , Helen ! The lovers start up hand in hand. p. 144 THEODORE stopping them . Ernest ! This dear child loves you better than herself ! You can not , must not , will not let her sin . ERNEST angered , turns on THEODORE . Sin ! Who dares accuse this woman of sin ? I 've had enough of this ridiculous cant about sin . ERNEST and HELEN continue up stage to the centre door . UNCLE EVERETT up at centre door , stops HELEN and ERNEST . He is the only calm one . Where are you going ? HELEN To ask Julie to pack my things . ERNEST To telephone for a taxi . UNCLE EVERETT detaining lovers . You are determined to go to Paris together without being married ? HELEN Yes . UNCLE EVERETT Nothing can alter your decision ? HELEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , LUCY distracted but futile , THEODORE grieved but silent , JUDGE the only calm one . UNCLE EVERETT Just a minute . Comes down a few steps , then turns to HELEN . Well , at least you wo n't start until the family arrive . p. 145 JOHN interrupting , crossing over to HELEN and ERNEST . In ten minutes  --  they 're on the way here now . HELEN Of course not . JOHN to ERNEST now , not HELEN . We have your word on that ? You promise not to leave this house until after you meet the family ? ERNEST about to say " You ass , " but instead  --  . Did n't we ask to meet the family ? HELEN and ERNEST turn to go . JOHN Wait . Helen , do you actually mean to acknowledge before the bishop and all your relatives that when you leave this house to-night you leave as this man 's mistress ? HELEN returning a step  --  to JOHN . Oh , do you still think that we are entering upon a sordid liaison ? Ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am to be his wife , he is to be my husband ? JOHN Oh , that sounds all right , but when it comes to the scratch she wo n't dare . This is to LUCY and THEODORE . ERNEST Wo n't she ? You do n't know her  --  oh , you 're such an ass ! HELEN and ERNEST go out. p. 146 UNCLE EVERETT Well , you bungled it . I knew you would . Enter BUTLER from the right . BUTLER Mr. and Mrs. Willoughby and the bishop have come . LUCY Good gracious ! Already ? JOHN Ask them to wait in the drawing-rom . The BUTLER goes out . LUCY Oh , save us , Uncle Everett , save the family . UNCLE EVERETT How do you expect me to save the family ? If John could only keep his mouth shut To JOHN . Finesse ! You ca n't do anything but make money . JOHN Ah ! Why did n't I think of it ! Money . We 've given ' em nothing but scares and sermons  --  we 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John , that wo n't work . JOHN with a significant smile . Every man has his price , Theodore . THEODORE turns away . JUDGE comes down and sits on the arm of the sofa . Listen . First , I 'll announce Jean 's engagement . Then I 'll offer Hamilton and Helen a big raise in salary and  --  LUCY And announce their engagement . p. 147 JOHN Yes , and with Theodore right here on the job , why , we 'll get ' em safely married before they leave the house . UNCLE EVERETT rising and coming to centre . And if that does n't work , I have a plan that will  --  if I can only manage it . JOHN turns to JUDGE . What is it  --  quick ! BUTLER enters with a telegram on tray . UNCLE EVERETT It 's desperate , it 's high-handed , it 's one chance in a million , but it 's our last hope . If I can only work it , only work it ! BUTLER Telegram , sir . BUTLER hands telegram to JUDGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BUTLER after crossing back to door on the right . Shall I announce dinner as soon as all the family arrive ? THEODORE What shall we do with them ? LUCY We 're not even dressed . JOHN All right , all right , Thomas . BUTLER goes out . UNCLE EVERETT jumping up and waving the telegram . Your aunt Julia 's coming back to me ! She 's coming back , I tell you . Hands telegram to JOHN. p. 148 JOHN Think  --  man  --  think . Rex is dining here , too . If Hamilton gets up and announces to the whole table that he is taking Helen to Paris as his mistress  --  JOHN hands it to LUCY . UNCLE EVERETT to LUCY . Read it , read it ! LUCY handing telegram unread to THEODORE . Jean 's engagement will be broken UNCLE EVERETT to THEODORE . She 's coming back , I tell you . Theodore , read it . THEODORE handing telegram unread to LUCY , who returns it to JOHN . And my chapel 's gone JOHN handing telegram , still unread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man is gone ; everything is gone . UNCLE EVERETT What do I care about all that ! What do I care about Jean 's engagement  --  my wife 's coming home ! Starts to dance , crosses and grasps LUCY about the waist and begins to dance with her . He sings . " Your aunt Julia 's coming home , Coming home , coming home ; Your aunt Julia 's coming home , Coming home from Reno . " After finishing he goes up centre. p. 149 JOHN Oh , wo n't you keep quiet ? UNCLE EVERETT Why should I keep quiet ? My wife 's coming home . JOHN to JUDGE . Aunt Susan and the bishop will hear you . Goes down and joins THEODORE and LUCY . UNCLE EVERETT What do I care  --  I want ' em to hear . Shouts . My wife 's coming home ! Comes down to left of JOHN . Just hear this JOHN , LUCY , and THEODORE confer apart exicitedly . JUDGE reads telegram . " Dear Boy : I ca n't stand this separation another day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He sits on the sofa . Kisses telegram  --  brings out from his pocket his sheaf of blanks  --  and during the triologue below  --  singing between sentences : " My bonnie is coming from Reno  --  My bonnie will not be divorced  --  My bonnie is coming from Reno  --  Oh , bring back my bonnie to " Stops and makes correction in his writing . JOHN to LUCY and THEODORE  --  speaks through the JUDGE 's singing . First I 'll propose a toast to Rex and Jean ; then I 'll say : " Another toast , and another engagement . " p. 150 LUCY nodding . They wo n't deny that they 're engaged . THEODORE nodding . Yes , sweep them off their feet , conquer them by kindness , and then play for time . UNCLE EVERETT stops writing , thinking they are all interested . You know , we thought we believed in trial marriage . Nothing of the sort . Trial separation .

Oh , wo n't you please shut up ? To others again . UNCLE EVERETT too happy to notice JOHN 's rebuke , sorting out received telegrams . You know , John , this morning when she telegraphed me about catching cold for my sake , I wired back a question . Picks out one of the many telegrams . Want to see her reply , John ? p. 151 JOHN turning from others to JUDGE . I do not . Turns to others . UNCLE EVERETT insists . Only one word . I had asked her : " Are you getting a divorce for my sake , too ? " Here is what she says  --  the sweetest word in the English language , John ; read it . JOHN , irritated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tutti-frutti "  --  Bah ! JOHN crosses to left and throws down telegram . JUDGE at once picks it up and smooths it out , kisses it , places with the others in his pocket , and goes up centre , where he meets HELEN and ERNEST . The BUTLER enters . BUTLER Mr. and Mrs. Spencer and Doctor Hawksbee are in the drawing-room . All the guests have arrived and dinner is served . HELEN and ERNEST enter . LUCY What 'll we do ? Oh ! what a day , what a day ! JOHN to BUTLER , waving him off . In a moment , in a moment . ERNEST Thomas , let me know when my taxi comes .

To HELEN . The morality of marriage . JOHN turning to ERNEST . How dare you talk of morality ? By what right do you sneer at my sister 's marriage ? REX entering . Oh , I beg your pardon , I 'm afraid I 'm butting in. p. 153 JOHN nervously . Oh , no . We 've just been having a pleasant little family talk .
