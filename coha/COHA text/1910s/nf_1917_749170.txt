From the bequest made to West Cambridge by Dr. Ebenezer Learned , of money to purchase " such books as will best promote useful knowledge and the Christian virtues " to the present day of organized work with children  --  of the training of children 's librarians , of cooperative evaluated lists of books , of methods of extension  --  the development has been gradual , yet with a constantly broadening point of view . A number of libraries have claimed the honor of being the first to establish children 's work  --  a fact which in itself seems to show that the movement was general rather than sporadic . The library periodicals contain many interesting accounts of these beginnings , a number of which have been mentioned in the articles included in this volume . Certain personalities stand out very clearly in the history of the early days , and many of the same ones are still closely associated with children 's work in its later developments . The Library Journal says editorially in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for children within a public library should remain with Mrs. Sanders of the Pawtucket Library , who made the small folk welcome a generation ago , when , in most public libraries , they were barred out by the rules and regulations and frowned away by the librarian . " Three articles from Miss Caroline Hewins 's pen have been chosen for this collection , the last written thirty-two years later than the first . They not only give details of the history of children 's work , but reflect Miss Hewins 's personality and opinions . A paper given by Miss Lutie E. Stearns at the Lake Placid Conference of the American Library Association in 1894 has been referred to as one of the most important contributions to the development of work with children . This paper was printed in the first volume of this series , " Library and school " ( New York , 1914 ) . The leading editorial in The Library Journal for April , 1898 , says : " Within the past year or two the phrase ' the library and the child '  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been changed about . It is now ' the child and the library , ' and the transposition is suggestive of the increasing emphasis given to that phase of library work that deals with children , either by themselves or in connection with their schools . " Mr. Henry E. Legler , in the last paper in this group , traces the growth of the " conception of what the duty of society is to the child " ; claims that the children 's library should be one in a union of social forces , and asserts that it contributes to the building of character , the enlargement of narrow lives , the opening of opportunity to all alike . Thus the modern viewpoint includes the ideals of democracy in addition to Dr. Learned 's emphasis on " knowledge " and " virtue " and probably points the way to the future development of library work with children . @# PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND THE YOUNG @# The special report on " Public Libraries in the United States of America , " published in 1876 by the U. S. Bureau of Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he advocates the removal of age-restriction and emphasizes the importance of choosing only those books which " have something positively good about them . " This and the following eight papers give , in some measure , a history of library work with children . William Isaac Fletcher was born in Burlington , Vermont , April 28 , 1844 . He was educated in the Winchester , Mass. , schools , and received the honorary degree of A.M. from Amherst in 1884 . He served as librarian of Amherst College from 1883 to 1911 , when he was made librarian emeritus . Mr. Fletcher was joint editor of Poole 's Index to Periodical Literature , and editor of the continuation from 1882 to 1911 ; edited the A. L. A. Index to general literature in 1893 and 1901 ; the Cooperative Index to periodicals from 1883 to 1911 , and in 1895 published his Public Libraries in America . He was president of the A. L. A. in 1891-1892. @# What shall the public library do for the young , and how ? is a question of acknowledged importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the growing importance of this portion of the community in the eyes of book producers , while the character of much of this literature , which is now almost thrust into the hands of youth , is such as to excite grave doubts as to its being of any service , intellectual or moral . In this state of things the public library is looked to by some with hope , by others with fear , according as its management is apparently such as to draw young readers away from merely frivolous reading , or to make such reading more accessible and encourage them in the use of it ; hence the importance of a judicious administration of the library in this regard . One of the first questions to be met in arranging a code of rules for the government of a public library relates to the age at which young persons shall be admitted to its privileges . There is no usage on this point which can be called common , but most libraries fix a certain age , as twelve or fourteen , below which candidates for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently established libraries have adopted what seems to be the right solution of this question , by making no restriction whatever as to age . This course recommends itself as the wisest and the most consistent with the idea of the public library on many grounds . In the first place , age is no criterion of mental condition and capacity . So varying is the date of the awakening of intellectual life , and the rapidity of its progress , that height of stature might almost as well be taken for its measure as length of years . In every community there are some young minds of peculiar gifts and precocious development , as fit to cope with the masterpieces of literature at ten years of age , as the average person of twenty , and more appreciative of them . From this class come the minds which rule the world of mind , and confer the greatest benefits on the race . How can the public library do more for the intellectual culture of the whole community than by setting forward in their careers those who will be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lives of those who have been eminent in literature and science do we find a youth almost discouraged because deprived of the means of intellectual growth . The lack of appreciation of youthful demands for culture is one of the saddest chapters in the history of the world 's comprehending not the light which comes into it . Our public libraries will fail in an important part of their mission if they shut out from their treasures minds craving the best , and for the best purposes , because , forsooth , the child is too young to read good books . Some will be found to advocate the exclusion of such searchers for knowledge on the ground that precocious tastes should be repressed in the interests of physical health . But a careful investigation of the facts in such cases can hardly fail to convince one that in them repression is the last thing that will bring about bodily health and vigor . There should doubtless be regulation , but nothing will be so likely to conduce to the health and physical well being of a person with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cases can be cited where children , having what seemed to be a premature development of mental qualities coupled with weak or even diseased bodily constitutions , have rapidly improved in health when circumstances have allowed the free exercise of their intellectual powers , and have finally attained a maturity vigorous alike in body and mind . This is in the nature of a digression , but it can do no harm to call attention thus to the facts which contradict the common notion that intellectual precocity should be discouraged . Nature is the best guide , and it is in accordance with all her workings , that when she has in hand the production of a giant of intellect , the young Hercules should astonish observers by feats of strength even in his cradle . Let not the public library , then , be found working against nature by establishing , as far as its influence goes , a dead level of intellectual attainments for all persons below a certain age . But there is a much larger class of young persons who ought not to be excluded from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are mentally mature , but because they have capacities for the cultivation of good tastes , and because the cultivation of such tastes can not be begun too early . There is no greater mistake in morals than that often covered by the saying , harmless enough literally , " Boys will be boys . " This saying is used perhaps oftener than for any other purpose to justify boys in doing things which are morally not fit for men to do , and is thus the expression of that great error that immoralities early in life are to be expected and should not be severely deprecated . The same misconception of the relations of youth to maturity and of nature 's great laws of growth and development is seen in that common idea that children need not be expected to have any literary tastes ; that they may well be allowed to confine their reading to the frivolous , the merely amusing . That this view is an erroneous one thought and observation agree in showing . Much like the caution of the mother who would not allow her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to swim , is that of those who would have youth wait till a certain age , when they ought to have good tastes formed , before they can be admitted to companionship with the best influences for the cultivation of them . Who will presume to set the age at which a child may first be stirred with the beginnings of a healthy intellectual appetite on getting a taste of the strong meat of good literature ? This point is one of the first importance . No after efforts can accomplish what is done with ease early in life in the way of forming habits either mental or moral , and if there is any truth in the idea that the public library is not merely a storehouse for the supply of the wants of the reading public , but also and especially an educational institution which shall create wants where they do not exist , then the library ought to bring its influences to bear on the young as early as possible . And this is not a question of inducing young persons to read , but of directing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is little probability that exclusion from the public library will prevent their reading . Poor , indeed , in all manner of resources , must be the child who can not now buy , beg , or borrow a fair supply of reading of some kind ; so that exclusion from the library is likely to be a shutting up of the boy or girl to dime novels and story papers as the staple of reading . Complaints are often made that public libraries foster a taste for light reading , especially among the young . Those who make this complaint too often fail to perceive that the tastes indulged by those who are admitted to the use of the public library at the age of twelve or fourteen , are the tastes formed in the previous years of exclusion . A slight examination of facts , such as can be furnished by any librarian of experience in a circulating public library , will show how little force there is in this objection . Nor should it be forgotten , in considering this question , that to very many young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for reading than any other portion of life is likely to furnish . At the age of twelve or fourteen , or even earlier , they are set at work to earn their living , and thereafter their opportunities for culture are but slight , nor are their circumstances such as to encourage them in such a work . We can not begin too early to give them a bent towards culture which shall abide by them and raise them above the work-a-day world which will demand so large a share of their time and strength . The mechanic , the farmer , the man in any walk of life , who has early formed good habits of reading , is the one who will magnify his calling , and occupy the highest positions in it . And to the thousands of young people , in whose homes there is none of the atmosphere of culture or of the appliances for it , the public library ought to furnish the means of keeping pace intellectually with the more favored children of homes where good books abound and their subtle influence extends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand them . If it fails to do this it is hardly a fit adjunct to our school system , whose aim it is to give every man a chance to be the equal of every other man , if he can . It is not claimed that the arguments used in support of an age limitation are of no force ; but it is believed that they are founded on objections to the admission of the young to library privileges which are good only as against an indiscriminate and not properly regulated admission , and which are not applicable to the extension of the use of the library to the young under such conditions and restrictions as are required by their peculiar circumstances . For example , the public library ought not to furnish young persons with a means of avoiding parental supervision of their reading . A regulation making the written consent of the parent a prerequisite to the registration of the name of a minor , and the continuance of such consent a condition of the continuance of the privilege , will take from parents all cause for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to stand between pupils in school and their studies , as it is often complained that it does . To remove this difficulty , the relations of the library to the school system should be such that teachers should be able to regulate the use of the library by those pupils whose studies are evidently interfered with by their miscellaneous reading . The use of the library would thus be a stimulus to endeavor on the part of pupils who would regard its loss as the probable result of lack of diligence in their studies . Again , it must be understood that to the young , as to all others , the library is open only during good behavior . The common idea that children and youth are more likely than older persons to commit offenses against library discipline is not borne out by experience ; but were it true , a strict enforcement of rules as to fines and penalties would protect the library against loss and injury , the fear of suspension from the use of the library as the result of carelessness in its use , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carelessness . If there are other objections to the indiscriminate admission of the young to the library , they can also be met by such regulations as readily suggest themselves , and should not be allowed to count as arguments against a judicious and proper extension of the benefits of the library to the young . @# CHOICE OF BOOKS But when the doors of the public library are thrown open to the young , and they are recognized as an important class of its patrons , the question comes up , What shall the library furnish to this class in order to meet its wants ? If the object of the library is understood to be simply the supplying of the wants of the reading public , and the young are considered as a portion of that public , the question is very easily answered by saying , Give them what they call for that is not positively injurious in its tendency . But if we regard the public library as an educational means rather than a mere clubbing arrangement for the economical supply of reading , just as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it becomes of importance , especially with reference to the young , who are the most susceptible to educating influences , that they should receive from the library that which will do them good ; and the managers of the library appear not as caterers to a master whose will is the rule as to what shall be furnished , but rather as the trainers of gymnasts who seek to provide that which will be of the greatest service to their men . No doubt both these elements enter into a true conception of the duty of library managers ; but when we are regarding especially the young , the latter view comes nearer the truth than the other . In the first place , among the special requirements of the young is this , that the library shall interest and be attractive to them . The attitude of some public libraries toward the young and the uncultivated seems to say to them , " We can not encourage you in your low state of culture ; you must come up to the level of appreciating what is really high toned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The public library being , however , largely if not mainly for the benefit of the uncultivated , must , to a large extent , come down to the level of this class and meet them on common ground . Every library ought to have a large list of good juvenile books , a statement which at once raises the question , What are good juvenile books ? This is one of the vexed questions of the literary world , closely allied to the one which has so often been mooted in the press and the pulpit , as to the utility and propriety of novel reading . But while this question is one on which there are great differences of opinion , there are a few things which may be said on it without diffidence or the fear of successful contradiction . Of this kind is the remark that good juvenile books must have something positively good about them . They should be not merely amusing or entertaining and harmless , but instructive and stimulating to the better nature . Fortunately such books are not so rare as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being turned to the work of providing them . Within a few months such honored names in the world of letters as those of Hamerton and Higginson have been added to the list which contains those of " Peter Parley , " Jacob Abbott , " Walter Aimwell , " Elijah Kellogg , Thomas Hughes , and others who have devoted their talents , not to the amusement , but to the instruction and culture of youth . The names of some of the most popular writers for young people in our day are not ranked with those mentioned above , not because their productions are positively injurious , but because they lack the positively good qualities demanded by our definition . There is a danger to youth in reading some books which are not open to the charge of directly injurious tendencies . Many of the most popular juveniles , while running over with excellent " morals , " are unwholesome mental food for the young , for the reason that they are essentially untrue . That is , they give false views of life , making it consist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventures , hair-breadth escapes ; encounters with tyrannical schoolmasters and unnatural parents ; sea voyages in which the green hand commands a ship and defeats a mutiny out of sheer smartness ; rides on runaway locomotives , strokes of good luck , and a persistent turning up of things just when they are wanted  --  all of which is calculated in the long run to lead away the young imagination and impart discontent with the common lot of an uneventful life . Books of adventure seem to meet a real want in the minds of the young , and should not be entirely ruled out ; but they can not be included among the books the reading of which should be encouraged or greatly extended . In the public library it will be found perhaps necessary not to exclude this class of juvenile books entirely . Such an exclusion is not here advocated , but it is rather urged that they should not form the staple of juvenile reading furnished by the library . The better books should be duplicated so as to be on hand when called for ; these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally be had as the " seasoning " to a course of good reading . But the young patrons of the library ought not to be encouraged in confining their reading to juveniles , of no matter how good quality . It is the one great evil of this era of juvenile books , good and bad , that by supplying mental food in the form fit for mere children , they postpone the attainment of a taste for the strong meat of real literature ; and the public library ought to be influential in exalting this real literature and keeping it before the people , stemming with it the current of trash which is so eagerly welcomed because it is new or because it is interesting . When children were driven to read the same books as their elders or not to read at all , there were doubtless thousands , probably the majority of all , who chose the latter alternative , and read but very little in their younger years . This class is better off now than then by the greater inducements offered them to mental culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be danger that the ease and smoothness of the royal road to knowledge now provided in the great array of easy books in all departments will not conduce to the formation of such mental growths as resulted from the pursuit of knowledge under difficulties . There is doubtless more knowledge ; but is there as much power and muscle of mind ? However this may be , none can fail to recognize the importance of setting young people in the way of reading the best books early in life . And as the public library is likely to be the one place where the masters of literature can be found , it is essential that here they should be put by every available means in communication with and under the influence of these masters . It only remains now to say that , as we have before intimated the public library should be viewed as an adjunct of the public school system , and to suggest that in one or two ways the school may work together with the library in directing the reading of the young . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; by selecting subjects on which information can be had at the library , the teacher can send the pupil to the library as a student , and readily put him in communication with , and excite his interest in , classes of books to which he has been a stranger and indifferent . Again , in the study of the history of English literature , a study which , to the credit of our teachers be it said , is being rapidly extended , the pupils may be induced to take new interest , and gain greatly in point of real culture by being referred for illustrative matter to the public library . @# @# BOYS ' AND GIRLS ' READING @# This first of a series of yearly reports on " Reading for the young " was made by Miss Caroline M. Hewins at the Cincinnati Conference of the A. L. A. in 1882 . It embodies answers from twenty-five librarians to the question , " What are you doing to encourage a love of good reading in boys and girls ? " Caroline Maria Hewins was born in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended high school in Boston ; received her library training in the Boston Athenaeum ; taught in private schools for several years , and took a year 's special course in Boston University . In 1911 she received an honorary degree of M.A. from Trinity College , Hartford . She has been librarian in Hartford , Conn. , for many years , from 1875 to 1892 in the Hartford Library Association , since that time in the Hartford Public Library . She has done editorial work for various magazines and has contributed many articles to the library periodicals . Her list of " Books for boys and girls , " of which the third edition was published in 1915 , represents the result of many years ' thoughtful and appreciative study of children 's literature . Library work with children owes to Miss Hewins a debt of gratitude for her unusual contribution to the establishment of high standards , the development of a broad vision , and the maintenance of a wholesome , sympathetic , but not sentimental point of view . @# About the first of March I sent cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , asking , " What are you doing to encourage a love of good reading in boys and girls ? " and soon after published a notice in the New York Evening Post and Nation , saying that statements from librarians and teachers concerning their work in the same direction would be gladly received The cards brought , in almost every case , full answers ; the newspaper notice has produced few results . The printed report of the Thomas Crane Public Library , Quincy , Mass. , says : " The trustees have recently made a special effort to encourage the use of the library in connection with the course of teaching in the public schools . Under a rule adopted two years ago the teachers of certain grades of schools are in the practice of borrowing a number of those volumes they consider best adapted to the use of their scholars , and keeping them in constant circulation among them . During the year two lists of books for the use of the children in the public schools were printed under the direction of the trustees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , biographies , histories , and books of a more instructive character . All the works included were selected by the trustees as being such as they would put in the hands of their own children . The lists thus prepared were then given to the teachers of the schools for gratuitous circulation among their scholars . " Mr. Green , of the Worcester , Mass. , Free Public Library , writes : " The close connection which exists between the library and the schools is doing much to elevate the character of the reading of the boys and girls . Many books are used for collateral reading , others to supplement the instruction of text-books in geography and history , others still in the employment of leisure hours in school . Boys and girls are led to read good books and come to the library for similar ones . Lists of good books are kept in the librarian 's room , and are much used by teachers and pupils . " Mr. Upton , of the Peabody Library , Peabody , Mass. , gives as his opinion : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be troubled as to good reading . My experience of about thirty- five or forty years as a public grammar-school teacher is , that teachers can control , to a great extent , the reading of their pupils , and also that , as a class , teachers are not GREAT readers . We should have little trouble in changing to some degree our circulation , but our thirteen-foot shelves and long ladders prevent the employment of the best help . We print bulletins and assist all who ask aid . " Miss Bean , of the Public Library , Brookline , Mass. , says : " I have no statistics of results relative to my school finding-list . Its influence is quietly but steadily making itself felt . The teachers tell me that many of the pupils use no other catalogue in selecting books from the library , and I know there are many families where the children are restricted to its use . We keep two or three interleaved and posted with the newest books when I think them desirable . Several of the teachers have told me personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but teachers are mortal and human . Many of them think duty done when the day 's session is over , and the matter of outside reading with their pupils is of little moment to them . I want to get out a revised list , with useful notes . " Mr. Rice , of the City Library , Springfield , Mass. , writes : " We have a manuscript catalogue of the best and most popular books for boys and girls . We call attention to the best books as we have opportunity when the young people visit the library . We endeavor to influence the teachers in our public schools to aid us in directing the attention of boys and girls to the best juveniles , and such other books as they can appreciate . " Mr. Arnold , of the Public Library , Taunton , Mass. , says : " What I am doing is to indicate in the margin of my catalogues the works which are adapted to the taste and comprehension of young people , so that not only their own attention may be diverted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may easily furnish them with proper lists . We aim at excluding from the library books of a sensational character , as well as those positively objectionable on the score of morality . " Miss James , librarian of the Free Library , Newton , Mass. , in speaking of the catalogue , without notes , of children 's books , published by that library in 1878 , and given to the pupils of the public schools , says : " I do not think that catalogue ever influenced a dozen children . We have just completed a very full card-catalogue which the children use a great deal in connection with their studies . Eleven hundred zinc headings are a great help . I frequently speak to the children to get acquainted with them , so they are quite free to ask for help . Our local paper has offered me half a column a week for titles and notices . I shall , of course , notice children 's books as well as others . " Mr. Peirce , the superintendent , says in his last report : " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of childhood is neglected , as a rule , that the library with us is in any wise abused by the over-crowding of the mind with novels . In many of even these cases kind and wise restraint can be , and is , exercised by the librarian . " Mr. Cummings , curator of the Lower Hall card-catalogue of the Boston Public Library , and Miss Jenkins , assistant librarian in the same place , have kindly sent me the manuscripts of their forthcoming reports to the trustees . These reports are wholly on the methods and results of their personal intercourse with readers , and the increase in special reading during the last few years . Concerning boys and girls Mr. Cummings writes : " I must not forget the juvenile readers , school-boys and school- girls , and the children from the stores and offices about town . These latter are smart , bright , active little bodies , often more in earnest than their more fortunate fellows of the same age . They are an object of special solicitude and care . The school children come for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their lessons in school ; and such books are suggested as may be found useful . The two most available faculties in children to work upon are the heart and the imagination . Get a hold on their affections by encouraging words and manifesting a readiness to help them , and you command their devotion and confidence . Give them interesting books ( Optic and Alger , if needs be ) , and you fix their attention . Above all , let the book be interesting ; for the attention is never fixed by , nor does the memory ever retain , what is laborious to read . But , once assured of their devotion , with their confidence secured and their attention fixed , there is nothing to prevent the work of direction succeeding admirably with them . " Miss Jenkins says : " The use of the library by the young people is increasing every year . The change in the character of children 's books has been a great help to us , fairly crowding out many of the trashy stories so long the favorite reading . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their perseverance in seeking certain authors , and their continual exchange of books . I soon found their difficulties with the catalogue . They read only stories , and wanted those full of incident and excitement ; when their favorite author failed , they sought for something else that sounded right in the catalogue , or sometimes wrote only the numbers without much reference to the titles , trusting , I suppose , to luck . Not liking the looks of the books they would return them . A steady recurrence of this made it a nuisance . One of my first steps was to join one of the many groups around the room , and look over with them , suggest this author , or this , that , and the other book , until they were furnished with a list of books fairly suited to their age , and then , suggesting that the list should be kept for future reference , pass on to another group . This is now a general practice , and seems to suit the little folks ; if , after several applications , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a book . My young people began to ask me to help their friends , also to help others themselves ; so gradually the bright faces of my boy and girl friends have grown familiar , and as they gain confidence in me we strike out into other paths , and many bright , readable books , historical or containing bits of geography or elementary science , have been read . It so happened that many of my young friends grew quite confidential , and told me about their school and lessons . It was not very difficult to induce them to read some things bearing upon their studies ; these books were shown to their teachers , and many were ready to cooperate at once ; this led to an acquaintance with several , and the teachers ' plan of study became a basis of selection for reading in history , biography , travel , and natural science . From books suited to their capacity much effective work has been done . Several classes have studied English history , and their reading has been made supplementary from the topics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to them , they showed the effect of their reading by giving very good short sketches of these persons . American history  --  colonial , revolutionary , administrations , civil war , reconstruction  --  has been treated similarly , and the teachers are much gratified at the result . We find that these boys do not fall back to trashy reading , but ask for better reading in place of their old favorites . Several girls of the high school have sought assistance in their various studies , especially in Greek and Roman history , and have read , in connection with the histories recommended , novels and some interesting travels , and have spent much time over engravings and photographs illustrative of their reading . Two of these girls , having asked me for a novel , meaning something like their former reading , I made tests by giving them exactly what they asked for . Very soon both books were returned , with the remark , ' I could n't read it . ' In a little talk that ensued , and in which I drew from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they had developed , or grown , as they said . I could go on giving instances of this gradual development in individual cases , and of its influence upon others to whom these readers recommended what they had read , the increased call for the better books of fiction , biography , history , travel , miscellany , and science . In four years ' work books of sensational incident , so long popular , have lost much of their charm . They have been crowded out by better books and personal interests in the young people themselves . " Mr. Foster of the Public Library , Providence , R. I. , has sent an account in detail of his work among pupils and teachers , which may be thus condensed : Soon after the opening of the library , in 1878 , he held a conference with the grammar-school masters of the city , and through them met the other teachers . He printed for the use of pupils a list of suggestions , some of the most important of which were summed up in the following words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text-books ; " " Learn the proper use of reference-books ; " " Use imaginative literature , but not immoderately ; " " Do not try to cover too much ground ; " " Do not hesitate to ask for assistance and suggestions at the library ; " " See that you make your reading a definite gain to you in some direction . " Mr. Foster soon gained influence among the teachers by personally addressing them , and began to publish annotated lists of books for young readers . A reading hour was established in the public schools , and pupils learned to give in their own language the substance of books which they had read . Mr. Foster says : " Our plans were by no means limited to the public schools , but included Brown University , the Rhode Island State Normal School , the Commercial College , the private schools for girls , and the two private boys ' schools preparatory for college , one of which has ten teachers and some two hundred and fifty pupils . One morning I met the boys of this school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' talk on reading , particularly on the question how to direct one 's current reading , as of newspapers , into some channel of permanent interest and value . Since my address before the teachers of the State ( published in the papers and proceedings of the Rhode Island Institute of Instruction for 1880 ) we have had many calls for assistance from outside the city , from teachers in the high schools and grammar schools of other places . In 1878 I began the preparation of a bulletin of new books , issued quarterly by the State Board of Education , and there have been several instances of a series of references in connection with school-work . In July , 1880 , I sent to the different teachers a series of suggestions about the reading of their pupils , covering such points as preserving a record of the books read , books not being read and returned at too frequent intervals , and the inspection of these matters by the teacher , or rather establishing communication between the teacher and pupil so that these things shall be talked over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeals have been made by Mr. Foster in public addresses for supervision of children 's reading by teachers and parents , and duplicate copies of books have been placed in the library for school use . In conclusion , Mr. Foster adds : " There has been a gradual and steady advance in methods of cooperation and mutual understanding , so that now it is a perfectly understood thing , throughout the schools , among teachers and pupils , that the library stands ready to help them at almost every point . " Mrs. Sanders , of the Free Public Library , Pawtucket , R. I. , writes : " I am circulating by the thousand Rev. Washington Gladden 's ' How and What to Read , ' published as a circular by the State Board of Education of Rhode Island . I am constantly encouraging the children to come to me for assistance , which they are very ready to do ; and I find that after boys have had either a small or a full dose of Alger ( we do not admit ' Optic ' ) , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  - -  Knox , Butterworth , Coffin , Sparks , or Abbott . I find more satisfaction in directing the minds of boys than girls , for though I may and generally do succeed in interesting them in the very best of fiction , it is much more difficult to draw them into other channels , unless it is poetry . I should like very much to know if this is the experience of other librarians . My aim is first to interest girls or boys according to their ability to enjoy or appreciate , and gradually to develop whatever taste is the most prominent . For instance , I put on the shelves all mechanical books for boys ; works upon adornments for homes  --  painting , drawing , music , aids to little housekeepers , etc. , for the girls . " Mr. Fletcher , of the Watkinson Library , Hartford , Conn. , says , in a recent address on the public library question in its moral and religious aspect : " Many of our public libraries beg the whole question , so far as it refers to the youngest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A limit of fourteen or sixteen years is fixed , below which they are not admitted to the library as its patrons . But , in some of those more recently established , the wiser course has been adopted of fixing no such limitation . For , in these times , there is little probability that exclusion from the library will prevent their reading . Poor , indeed , in resources must be the child who can not now buy , beg , or borrow a fair supply of reading of some kind ; so that exclusion from the library is simply a shutting up of the boy or girl to the resources of the home and the book-shop or newspaper . A slight examination of the literature found in a majority of homes and most prominent in the shops is enough to show what this means , and to explain the fact , that the young persons first admitted to the public library at fourteen years of age come to it with a well-developed taste for trash and a good acquaintance with the names of authors in that department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture in higher directions . " Mr. Winchester , of the Russell Free Library , Middletown , Conn. , said in his report , last January : " A departure from the ordinary rules governing the use of the library has been made in favor of the teachers in the city schools , allowing a teacher to take to the school , a number of books upon any topic which may be the subject of study for the class for the time , and to retain them beyond the time regularly allowed . " In a letter three months later he writes , " I can not trace directly to this arrangement any change in the reading of young folks . We have taken a good deal of pains to get good books for the younger readers , and I make it a point to assist them whenever I can . I feel quite sure that , if trash is shut out of the library and withheld from young readers , and , if good and interesting books are offered to them , they will soon learn not to care for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Library , Waterbury , Conn. , says in his printed report : " The librarian can do a little towards leading young book-borrowers towards the selection of proper books , but it does not amount to much unless his efforts are seconded by parents and teachers . It is of little use , I fear , to appeal to parents to look after their children 's reading . It is possible that they do not know that , in not a few cases , boys and girls from eight to sixteen years of age , even while attending school , draw from three to six volumes a week to read , and often come for two volumes a day . That they fail to realize the effects of so much reading on their children 's minds is evident when we hear them say , and with no little pride , too , ' Our children are great readers ; they read all the time . ' Such parents ought to know that instead of turning out to be prodigies of learning , these library gluttons are far more likely to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rule , the poorest scholars and the worst thinkers . " He adds an appeal to teachers : " Give out questions that demand research , and send out pupils to the library for information if necessary , and be assured that a true librarian enjoys nothing so much as a search , with an earnest seeker , after truths that are hidden away in his books . Do not hesitate even to ask questions that you can not answer , and rely upon your pupils to answer them , and to give authorities , and do not be ashamed to learn of your pupils . Work with them as well as for them . But , whatever else you do , do not waste your time in urging your pupils to stop story-reading and to devote their time to good books . A parent can command this , you can not ; but you can make the use of good books , and the acquisition of knowledge not found in books , attractive and even necessary , and your ability to do this determines your real value as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into eagle-eyed and intelligent observers of all that is on , in , above , and under the earth . " Mr. Bassett writes that as a result of this appeal there was in November , December , January , and February , an increase of nineteen ( 19 ) per cent in the circulation of general literature , science , history , travel , and biography , and a decrease in juveniles of ten ( 10 ) per cent for January and February , 1882 , as compared with the same months of 1881 , For the first nineteen days of March the increase of the classes first-named was thirty-seven ( 37 ) per cent over last year , and the decrease in juvenile fiction twenty-seven ( 27 ) per cent . He ends his letter : " As a school officer and acting school visitor , I find that those teachers whose education is not limited to textbooks , and who are able to guide their pupils to full and accurate knowledge of subjects of study , are not only the best , but the only ones worth having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Burlington , Vermont , says : " I have withdrawn permanently all of Alger , Fosdick , Thomes , and Oliver Optic . I have for some time past been making the teachers in the primary schools my assistants without pay . I give them packages of books to circulate among their respective schools . Very good results have been obtained . The Police Gazette and other vile weeklies have been discarded for books from the Fletcher Library . Most of the young folks are not old enough to draw at the library themselves , and this method has to be used , as in many instances the parents will not or can not draw books for their children . Each teacher has a copy of Mr. Smart 's excellent book , ' Reading for Young People . ' Such books as are in our collection are designated in their copies . " The New York Free Circulating Library is quietly doing good by the establishment of carefully selected branch libraries in the poorest and most thickly settled parts of the city In the words of the last report : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers in search of information , however trivial may be the subject , and , while the readers are to have free scope in their choice of books , librarians have attempted , when they properly could do so , free from seeming officiousness , to suggest books of the best character , and induce the cultivation of a good literary taste . " Miss Coe , the librarian , adds , " Boys will read the best books , if they can get them . " Mr. Schwartz , of the Apprentices ' Library , New York , says : " We are always ready and willing to direct and advise in special cases , but have not as yet been able to come across any general plan that seemed to us to promise success . The term ' good reading ' is relative , and must vary according to the taste of each reader , and it is just this variety of standards that seems to present an unsurmountable obstacle to any general and comprehensive system of suggestions . " Miss Bullard , of the Seymour Library , Auburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty-five ( 65 ) to fifty-eight ( 58 ) per cent in the last five years . She says : " I have endeavored , year by year , to gain the confidence of the younger portion of our subscribers in my ability to always furnish them with interesting reading , and have thus been able to turn them from the domain of fiction into the more useful fields of literature . Another noticeable and encouraging feature of the library is the increasing use made of it by pupils in the high school in connection with school-work . " Mr. Larned , of the Young Men 's Library of Buffalo , N. Y. , writes : " I think the little catalogue is doing a great deal of good among our young readers and among parents and teachers . We exert what personal influence we can in the library , but there are no other special measures that we employ . " The catalogue , a carefully chosen list of books for young readers , with stars placed against those specially recommended , includes , besides books mentioned in other letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuckey 's Joan of Arc , Le Liefde 's Great Dutch Admirals , Eggleston 's Famous American Indians , Bryan 's History of the United States , Verne 's Exploration of the World , Du Chaillu 's books , What Mr. Darwin Saw , Science Primers , Faraday 's Chemical History of a Candle , Smiles 's Biographies , Clodd 's Childhood of the World , Viollet Le Duc 's Learning to Draw , Dana 's Household Book of Poetry , Uncle Remus , Sir Roger de Coverley , several pages on out and in door games , hunting and fishing , with plenty of myths and fairy tales , an annotated selection of historical novels , and a short list of good stories . The Friends ' Free Library , Germantown , Pa. , still excludes all fiction except a few carefully chosen stories for children . The report of the committee says : " Our example has been serviceable in stimulating some other library committees and communities to use more discrimination in their selection of books than may have been the case with them in the past . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatening contamination , if in our power to do so , the divine law of love to our neighbor thence instructs us to use the opportunity to put far away the evil from him also . " The representatives of the religious Society of Friends for Pennsylvania , New Jersey , and Delaware , have published during the year a protest against demoralizing literature and art , taking the ground that the national standard of moral purity is lowered , and the sanctity of marriage weakened , by most of the books , pictures , and theatrical exhibitions of to-day . The current report of the Cincinnati public schools gives a full account of the celebrations of authors ' birthdays in the last two years , and the superintendent , the Hon. John B. Peaslee , LL.D. , in an address on moral and literary training in school , urges that the custom , so successfully begun , shall be kept up , and that children in all grades of schools shall be required to learn every week a few lines of good poetry , instead of choosing for themselves either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his last report for coooperation between the school and the library , and says in a letter : " I read a paper some time ago which was published in a teachers ' magazine , and have addressed our Cincinnati teachers . We purchased a number of the catalogues of the Young Men 's Library of Buffalo , and have written in our corresponding shelf numbers . A few of our teachers have also obtained these catalogues . I judge that the children are beginning to take out better books than formerly . The celebration of authors ' days in the schools has been very beneficial in making the children acquainted with some of the best literature in the libraries as well as with the use of books of reference . " Miss Stevens , of the Public Library , Toledo , Ohio , says : " We are fond of children , and suggest to them books that they will like . Give a popular boy a good book , and there is not much rest for that book . Librarians should like children . " Mr. Poole , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met the principals of the schools , and have addressed them on their duties in regulating the reading of their pupils , and advising their pupils as to what to read and how to read . My talk has awakened some interest in the teachers , and a committee has been appointed to consider what can be done about it . " Mr. Carnes , of the Odd Fellows ' Library Association , San Francisco , fires this shot in his report : " Even the child knows that forbidden fruit is the sweetest on the branch . If you wish to compel a boy to read a given book , strictly forbid him even to take it from the shelves . The tabooed books will somehow be secured in spite of their withdrawal . " Mr. Metcalf , of the Wells School , Boston , who told at the conference of 1879 of his work in encouraging a love for good , careful , and critical reading , writes : " My girls have bought Scott 's Talisman , and we have read it together . I have now sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second class have read , on the same plan , this year , Mrs. Whitney 's We Girls , and the third class have finished Towle 's Pizarro , and are now reading Leslie Goldthwaite . The City Council refused , last year , to appropriate the $1,000 asked for . When we have the means , all our grammar and high school masters will be able to order from the library such books as are suited to their classes . This plan introduces the children to a kind of reading somewhat better than would otherwise reach them , and , best of all , it gives them great facility in expression . " Hartford , which has now no free circulating library , but hopes for one within two years , still keeps the old district system of schools , and several of these schools have a library fund . Mr. Barrows , principal of the Brown School , writes : " Our library contains the usual school reference-books . Recently we have added quite a number of books especially adapted to interest and instruct children , such as The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zigzag Journeys , Forbes 's Fairy Geography , etc . The children are not permitted to take these books away from the building . Pupils are invited to bring such additional facts in geography , or history , as they may obtain by reading . Topics are assigned . Should spices be the topic , one pupil would read up concerning cloves ; another nutmeg , etc . Again , pupils are allowed to make their own selections , and invited to give , at a specified time , any facts in geography , history , natural science , manufactures , inventions , etc . For this extra work extra credits are given . Our object is to cause pupils to realize the conscious and abiding pleasure that comes by instructive reading ; to encourage such as have not been readers to read , and to influence such as have been readers of trash to become readers of profitable books . The result , so far , is very encouraging . Many have become enthusiastic readers , and can give more facts and information thus obtained than we have time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a desire that their presents might be books , such as we have in our library ; for they do not have time at school to exhaust the reading of these books , and consequently do not lose their interest . " Within the last few months Mr. Northrop , Secretary of the Board of Education of Connecticut , has distributed in the high schools and upper classes of the grammar schools of the State , blanks to be filled by the pupils with the kind of reading that they like best , and the names of their favorite authors . Several hundred of these circulars were destroyed when the Hartford High School was burned last winter . The publication of a list of books suitable for boys and girls has been delayed , but Mr. Holbrook , of the Morgan School , Clinton , Conn. , who prepared the list , writes concerning his work in school : " I have the practical disbursement of three or four hundred dollars a year for books . In the high school , in my walks at recess among the pupils , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then , when the iron is hot , I make the proposition that if they will promise to read nothing but what I give them I will make out a schedule for them . A pupil spending one hour , even less , a day , religiously observing the time , will , in five years , have read every book that should be read in the library . Those who agree to the above proposition I immediately start on the Epochs of History , turning aside at proper times to read some historical novel . When that is done I give them Motley , then Dickens , or Prescott , or Macaulay , Hawthorne , Thackeray , Don Quixote . Cooper I depend on as a lure for younger readers . When they have read about enough ( in my opinion ) , I invite them to go a little higher . Whenever they come to the office and look helplessly about , I immediately jump up from my work , and , solving the personal equation , pick out two or three books which I think adapted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to welcome their appearance , assuring them that the books are to be read , urging the older ones to read carefully and with thought . Some I benefit ; others are too firmly wedded to their idols , Mrs. Holmes and Southworth . Finally , it is my aim to send them away from school with their eyes opened to the fact that they have , the majority , been reading to no purpose ; that there are better , higher , and nobler books than they ever dreamed of . Of course I do n't always accomplish this ; but he who aims at the sun will go higher than one aiming at the top of the barn . " A commission of sixteen ladies was appointed last year , by the Connecticut Congregational Club , to select and print a catalogue of books for Sunday Schools . During the year it has examined one hundred and eighty-four , almost all reprints of well-known books , and has selected one hundred . At least one annotated Sunday-School catalogue was prepared before the appointment of the commission , directing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School Days and Higginson 's Young Folks ' Book of American Explorers , and of older readers to Stanley 's Jewish Church , Martineau 's Household Education , Robertson 's Sermons , Sister Dora , Hypatia , Charles Kingsley 's Life , and Atkinson 's Right Use of Books . The conclusions to which these opinions , from libraries and schools in ten different States , lead us , are these : 1 . The number of fathers and mothers who directly supervise their children 's reading , limiting their number of library books to those which they themselves have read , and requiring a verbal or written account of each before another is taken , is small . 2 . The number of teachers who read and appreciate the best books , or take pains to search in libraries for those which illustrate lessons , or are good outside reading for the pupils , is also small . 3 . The high schools , normal schools , and colleges are every year sending out young men and women with little knowledge of books except text-books and poor novels . 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be and has been done by establishing direct communication between libraries and schools , making schools branch libraries . 5 . This can be done only by insisting that teachers in such towns and cities shall know something of literature , and by refusing to grant certificates to teachers who , in the course of an hour 's talk , do not show themselves well enough informed to guide children to a love of good books . The classes now reading under Mr. Metcalf 's direction in Boston , or celebrating authors ' days and the founding of their own state in Cincinnati , will be , in a few years , the teachers , the fathers , or the mothers of a new generation , and the result of their reading may be expected to appear in the awakened intelligence of their pupils and children . 6 . Daily newspapers may be used with advantage in schools to encourage children to read on current events and to verify references . 7 . Direct personal intercourse of librarians and assistants with children is the surest way of gaining influence over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secret of the whole matter , so far as we are concerned , into four words : " Librarians should like children . " It may be added that a librarian or assistant in charge of circulation should never be too busy to talk with children and find out what they need . Bibliography and learning of all kinds have their places in a library ; but the counter where children go needs no abstracted scholar , absorbed in first editions or black-letter , but a winsome friend , to meet them more than halfway , patiently answer their questions , " and by slow degrees subdue them to the useful and the good . " @# READING OF THE YOUNG @# Miss Hewins made a later report on the same subject see the previous article in a paper presented before the World 's Library Congress in 1893 . In this paper , given below , she has summarized several of the early yearly reports made at the meetings of the A. L. A. , all of which are of great interest as a record of the work of various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the relation of public libraries and the young was treated by Mr. W. I. Fletcher , who discussed age-restrictions , direction of reading , choice of books , and incidentally the relation of libraries to schools , referring to librarians and trustees as " the trainers of gymnasts who seek to provide that which will be of greatest service to their men . " The report was suggestive , and called for several radical changes in the usual management of libraries . No statistics were given , for none had been called for , and the number of libraries which were working in the modern spirit was not large . Mr. Green , in his paper at the Philadelphia conference of 1876 ( L. j. 1 : 74 ) , gave some suggestions as to how to teach school boys and girls the use of books , and in one or two of the discussions the influence of a librarian on young readers was noticed , but the American Library Association did not give much time to the subject till the Boston conference of 1879 , when a whole session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. j. 4:319 ) , the general expression of opinion being similar to the formula expressed in the paper by Miss Mary A. Bean , " Lessen the quantity and improve the quality . " In 1881 , Mr. J. N. Larned , of the Buffalo Young Men 's Library , issued his pamphlet , " Books for young readers . " The report on " Boys ' and girls ' reading " which I had the honor of making at the Cincinnati conference of 1882 has answers from some 25 librarians to the question " What are you doing to encourage a love of good reading in boys and girls ? " ( L. j. 7:182 . ) Several speak of special catalogs or bulletins , most of personal interest in and friendship with young readers . One writes , " Give a popular boy a good book , and there is not much rest for that book . Librarians should like children . " It was in 1883 that , by the suggestion and advice of our lamented friend , Frederick Leypoldt , I published a little classified pamphlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same year the Library Journal began a department of " Literature for the young , " which was transferred at the end of the year to the Publishers ' Weekly , where it still remains . The report on the subject , made for the Buffalo conference by Miss Bean , is on the same lines as the former one , with the addition of the experience of some smaller libraries . She says , " I believe the Lynn library has hit a fundamental truth , and applied the sovereign remedy , so far as the question concerns public libraries , in its ' one-book-a-week ' rule for pupils of the schools . " Miss Hannah P. James 's report at the Lake George conference in 1885 ( L. j. 10:278 ) sums up the information received from 75 sources in some suggestions for work in connection with school and home , suggesting the publication of book lists in local papers , supervision of children 's reading if authority is given by parents , and the limitation of school children 's book to one or two a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sargent reported on " Reading for the young " ( L. j. 14:226 ) , One librarian fears that lists of books prepared for boys and girls will soon become lists to be avoided by them , on account of young people 's jealous suspicion of undue influence . Sargent 's " Reading for the young " was published just after the White Mountain conference of 1890 , and the subject was not discussed in San Francisco in 1891 or at Lakewood in 1892 except in relation to schools . The Ladies ' Commission on Sunday school books is at least five years older than the American Library Association . It has done good service in printing lists of books specially adapted to Unitarian Sunday schools , others unfitted for them only by a few doctrinal pages or sentences , and a third class recommended as household friends on account of their interests , literary value , and good tone . The Church Library Association stands in the same relation to Episcopal Sunday schools , recommending in yearly pamphlets : 1 . Books bearing directly on church life , history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctly church books . The Connecticut Ladies ' Commission has , at the request of the Connecticut Congregational Club , published since 1881 several carefully chosen and annotated lists . The National Young Folks ' Reading Circle , the Chautauqua Young Folks ' Reading Union , and the Columbian Reading Union , the latter a Catholic society , the others undenominational , have published good lists for young readers . The Catholic Church also recommends many recent stories for children which have no reference to doctrines or differences in belief . One hundred and fifty-two out of 160 libraries have answered the following questions : 1 . Are your children 's books kept by themselves ? 2 . Are they classified , and how ? 3 . Have they a separate card catalog or printed finding list ? 4 . Are they covered ? 5 . Do you enforce rules with regard to clean hands ? 6 . Have you an age limit , and if so , what is it ? 7 . Do you allow more than one book a week on a child 's card ? 8 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 . What authors are most read by children who take books from your library ? 10 . What methods have you of directing their reading ? Have you a special assistant for them , or are they encouraged to consult the librarian and all the assistants ? 11 . Have you a children 's reading room ? Seventy-seven reply to the first question that their children 's books are kept by themselves , 22 that stories or other books are separate from the rest of the library , and 53 that there is no juvenile division . Three answer simply " Yes " to the second question , 24 have adopted the Dewey system , in two or three cases with the Cutter author marks , 4 the Cutter , and 1 the Linderfelt system ; 10 arrange by authors , 18 by subjects , 4 by authors and subjects , 42 report methods of their own or classification like the rest of the library , and 46 do not classify children 's books at all . In answer to the third question , 6 libraries report both a separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sale or distribution , 15 a card catalog for children , and 88 no separate list . Of the printed finding lists 4 are Sargent 's , 1 Larned 's , 2 Hardy 's , and 2 Miss James 's . The fourth question relates to covering books for children . Eighty-five libraries do not cover them , 30 cover some , either those with light bindings or others that have become soiled and worn , 35 cover all , and 2 do not report . In reply to the fifth question , 45 libraries require that children 's hands shall be clean before they can take books from the library , or at least when they use books or periodicals in the building , and 50 have no such rules . Others try various methods of moral suasion , including in one instance a janitor who directs the unwashed to a lavatory , and in another a fine of a few cents for a second offense . The sixth question , whether there is an age limit or not , brings various replies . Thirty-six libraries have none , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one fixes it at 6 , one at 7 , and one at 8 . Ten libraries allow a child a card in his own name at 10 , two at 11 , forty-seven at 12 , six at 13 , thirty-three at 14 , four at 15 , and six at 16 . They qualify their statements in many cases by adding that children may use the cards of older persons , or may have them if they bring a written guarantee from their parents or are in certain classes in the public schools . Question 7 deals with the number of books a week allowed to children . Ninety-five libraries allow them to change a book every day ; one ( subscription ) gives them a dozen a day if they wish . Fifteen limit them to two , and 3 to three a week , and 16 to only one . Several librarians in libraries where children are allowed a book a day express their disapproval of the custom , and one has entered into an engagement with her young readers to take 1 book in every 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer definitely . A few libraries issuing two cards , or two-book cards , allow children the use of two books a week , if one is not a novel or story . Question 8 is a less important one , whether children 's cards are of a different color from others . There is no difference between the cards of adults and children in 124 libraries , except in case of school cards in 2 . In 4 the color of cards for home use varies , and 4 report other distinctions , like punches or different charging slips . Eight do not charge on cards and 12 do not answer . With regard to question 9 , " What authors are most read by children who take books from your library ? " the lists vary so much in length that it is impossible to give a fair idea of them in in few sentences . Some libraries mention only two or three authors , others ten times as many . Miss Alcott 's name is in more lists than any other . Where only two or three authors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castlemon , Finley , Optic grade . These four do not appear in the reports from 35 libraries , where Alden , Ballantyne , Mrs. Burnett , Susan Coolidge , Ellis , Henty , Kellogg , Lucy Lillie , Munroe , Otis , Stoddard , and various fairy tales fill their places . Seven are allowing Alger , Castlemon , Finley , and Optic to wear out without being replaced , and soon find that books of a higher type are just as interesting to young readers . Question 10 asks what methods are used in directing children 's reading , and if a special assistant is at their service , or if they are encouraged to consult the librarian and all the assistants . Many librarians overconscientiously say , " No methods , " but at the same time acknowledge the personal supervision and friendly interest that were meant in the query . Only nine do not report something of this kind . Six have , or are about to have , a special assistant , or have already opened a bureau of information . Five say that they pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the larger libraries have open shelves , and 2 are careful in the choice and supervision of assistants . In answer to question 11 , 5 report special reading rooms , present or prospective , for children ; 3 more wish that they had them , while others believe that the use of a room in common with older readers teaches them to be courteous and considerate to others . Most reading rooms are open to children , who sometimes have a table of their own , but in a few cases those under are excluded . My own opinion on the subjects treated in the questions are : 1 . It is easier for a librarian or assistant to find a book for a child if whatever is adapted to his intelligence on a certain subject is kept by itself , and not with other books which may be dry , out of date , or written for a trained student of mature mind . 2 . It is easier to help a child work up a subject if the books which he can use are divided into classes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card catalog for children often relieves a crowd at the other cases . A printed dictionary catalog without notes does not help a child . A public library can make no better investment than in printing a classified list for children , with short notes on stories illustrating history or life in different countries , and references to interesting books written for older readers . Such a list should be sold for 5 cents , much less than cost . 4 . The money spent in paying for the paper and time used in covering books is just as well employed in binding , and the attractive covers are pleasant to look at . 5 . The books can be kept reasonably clean if children are made to understand that they must not be taken away , returned , or if possible , read with unwashed hands . City children soon begin to understand this if they are spoken to pleasantly and sent away without a book till they come back in a fit state to handle it . 6 . As soon as a child can read and write he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from parent or teacher should , of course , be required . 7 . A child in school can not read more than one story book a week without neglecting his work . If he needs another book in connection with his studies he should take it on a school teacher 's , or nonfiction card . 8 . It is best , if a child has only one book a week , for his card to be of a different color from others , that it may be more easily distinguished at the charging desk . 9 . It has been proved by actual experiment that children will read books which are good in a literary sense if they are interesting . New libraries have the advantage over old ones , that they are not obliged to struggle against a demand for the boys ' series that were supplied in large quantities fifteen or twenty years ago . 10 . As soon as children learn that in a library there are books and people to help them on any subject , from the care of a sick rabbit to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask advice about their reading . It is a good thing if some of the library assistants are elder sisters in large families who have tumbled about among books , and if some of the questions asked of applicants for library positions relate to what they would give boys or girls to read . If an assistant in a large library shows a special fitness for work with children , it is best to give it into her charge . If all the assistants like it , let them have their share of it . 11 . The question of a children 's reading room depends on the size of the room for older readers , and how much it is used by them in the afternoons . Conditions vary so much in libraries that it is impossible for one to make a rule for another in this case . @# HOW LIBRARY WORK WITH CHILDREN HAS GROWN IN HARTFORD AND CONNECTICUT @# The Library Journal for February , 1914 , says : " One of the pleasantest features of ' Library week ' at Lake George in 1913 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England woman , whose sympathy with children and child life has made this relation of her public library work a type and model for all who have to do with children .... Miss Hewins 's paper was really a delightful bit of literary autobiography , and she has now happily acceded to a request from the Journal to fill out the outlines into a more complete record . " Not long ago I went into the public library of a university town in England and established confidence by saying , " I see that Chivers does your binding , " whereupon the librarian invited me inside the railing . A boy ten or twelve years old was standing in a Napoleonic attitude , with his feet very far apart , before the fiction shelves , where the books were alphabetized under authors , but with apparently nothing to show him whether a story was a problem-novel or a tale for children . My thoughts went back many years to the days when I first became the librarian of a subscription library in Hartford , where novels and children 's stories were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not by authors . There was a printed catalog , but without anything to indicate in what series or where in order of the series a story-book belonged , and it was impossible when a child had read one to find out what the next was except from the last page of the book itself or the advertisements in the back and they had often been torn out for convenient reference . My technical equipment was some volunteer work in a town library , a little experience in buying for a Sunday-school library , and about a year in the Boston Athenaeum . The preparation that I had had for meeting children and young people in the library was , besides some years of teaching , a working knowledge of the books that had been read and re-read in a large family for twenty-five years , from Miss Edgeworth and Jacob Abbott , an old copy of " Aesop 's fables , " Andersen , Grimm , Hawthorne , " The Arabian nights , " Mayne Reid 's earlier innocent even if unscientific stories , down through " Tom Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Folks , the Riverside Magazine , " Little women , " to Scott , Dickens , Thackeray , George Eliot , Charlotte Bronte and Mrs. Gaskell . These books were in the Hartford Young Men 's Institute , but they were little read in comparison with the works of the " immortal four , " who were then writing series at the rate of two or more volumes a year  --  Optic , Alger , Castlemon and Martha Finley  --  and still refuse to be forgotten . The older girls demanded Ouida , a new name to me , but I read some of her novels before I had been in the library many weeks , and remember writing a letter to a daily paper giving an outline of the plot of one of them as a hint to fathers and mothers of what their schoolgirl daughters were reading . I think that there was something about boys , too , in the letter , and a plea for " Ivanhoe " and other books of knightly adventure . The Young Men 's Institute Library in Hartford was a survival from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city had then a population of about fifty thousand , of whom some five or six hundred were subscribers to the library , paying three dollars for the use of one book at a time or five dollars for two , including admission to the periodical room . Hartford had a large number of Irish inhabitants , some Germans , a few of whom were intelligent and prosperous Jews , a few French Canadians , possibly still fewer Scandinavians . It was several years before the first persecution of the Russian and Polish Jews sent them to this country . In the year when I came , 1875 , there were forty-six boys and girls in the high school graduating class , all , from their names and what I know of some of them , apparently of English descent , except one whose name is Scotch . The class which was graduated last June had about 650 members on entering , and 250 at the end of its course . Among the names are Italian , Hebrew , Swedish , Irish , German , Danish , Spanish , Bohemian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descent being Hebrew . It is fair to say that at least half of the boys and girls of the earlier graduating class , or their families , had library subscriptions , but little use of the library was recommended even by the high school teachers , and none by the teachers of the graded schools . How could there be ? Five dollars is a large sum in most families , and children at that time had to read what they could get at home or from the Sunday-school libraries , which were no better nor worse than others of the period . The first effort that I remember making for a better choice of books was showing the library president some volumes by Thomes , a writer for the older boys , whose stories were full of profanity and brutal vulgarity . There was no question about discarding them and some of Mayne Reid 's books like " The scalp hunters " and " Lost Lenore , " which are much of the same type , very different from his earlier stories , and in a short time we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let them die out , replacing them if possible by stories a little better , giving preference to those complete in themselves . Within a short time , in 1878 , we began to publish a quarterly bulletin . In the first number " Library notes " begins : " Much time and thought have been given to suggesting in this bulletin good books for boys and girls . As a rule , they read too much . Our accounts show that one boy has taken 102 story-books in six months , and one girl 112 novels in the same time . One book a week is certainly enough , with school studies . Within the last month one boy has asked us for Jack Harkaway 's stories , another for bound volumes of the Police News , and a third for ' The murderer and the fortune teller , ' ' The two sisters and the avenger ' and ' The model town and the detective . ' These are not in the library and will not be . The demand for girls for the New York Weekly novels is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mothers in the choice of children 's books . " Of what we now call nature-books there were very few written or well illustrated for children , though the library had John Burroughs , Harris 's " Insects injurious to vegetation " and Samuels 's " Birds of New England and the adjacent states . " There was little interest in out-of-door study , and I have never forgotten the contempt on the face of one boy when instead of Mayne Reid 's " Boy hunters , " which was out , he was offered " The butter- fly hunters , " or the scorn with which he repeated the title . All that is changed , thanks to the influence of schools and teachers , and children are no longer ignorant of common birds and insects . St. Nicholas helped in opening their eyes , when a librarian , Harlan H. Ballard , of Pittsfield , organized the Agassiz Association with a monthly report in the magazine . We had a chapter , Hartford B. , that met for years out of doors on Saturday mornings through the spring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when some specimens of the redheaded woodpecker were on the edge of the city . Usually our winter meetings were in the library , and we often had readings from Burroughs , Thoreau , Frank Buckland and others of the earlier nature-lovers . The children came from families of more than usual intelligence , and some of them who now have well-grown children of their own often refer with pleasure to our walks and talks . I had taught for three years in a school where the children and I were taken out of doors every week in spring and autumn by an ornithologist and an entomologist . At this time we were beginning to buy more books on out-of-door subjects , and I had learned enough in my teaching to be able to evaluate them in a bulletin . The years went on , with once in a while an encouraging report about a boy who had made experiments from works on chemistry or beguiled a fortnight 's illness with Wordsworth 's " Greece , " or Guhl and Koner 's " Life of the Greeks and Romans , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lossing , Help 's " Life of Columbus " and Barber 's " History of New England . " Both boys and girls were beginning to apologize for taking poor stories . In one of our bulletins , January , 1881 , is an acknowledgment of Christmas material received from the advance sheets of Poole 's Index , then in preparation in the Watkinson Library , on the other side of the building . Imagine life in a library without it , you who have the Readers ' Guide and all the debates and Granger 's Index to Poetry and the Portrait Index ! Nevertheless , we were not entirely without printed aids , for we had the Brooklyn catalog , the Providence bulletins , and the lists of children 's books prepared by the Buffalo and Quincy libraries . In 1882 , at the request of Frederick Leypoldt , editor of the Publishers ' Weekly , I compiled a list of " Books for the young , " some of which are of permanent value . In a second edition , in 1884 , I reprinted from our bulletin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between twelve and fifteen , based on my own experience with boys and girls . I can laugh at it now , after years of meeting child-readers , seventy-five per cent of whom have no books at home , and can also find food for mirth in my belief that a list of books recommended for vacation reading in another bulletin would attract most boys and girls under sixteen . One school , under a wise and far-seeing principal , who is now an authority on United States history and the author of several school books on the subject , had in 1884 an arrangement with us for a supply of historical stories for reading , and we printed a list of these and of other books on American history which would be interesting if read by or to the older pupils in the grammar grades . Sets of fifty copies each of books for supplementary reading in school were bought by the library in 1894 , and apportioned by the school principals at their monthly meetings . Several new sets were bought every year till 1905 , when the collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we could spare for it . The schools then provided a place for the school duplicates , and relieved the library of the care of them . Since 1899 the graded schools have received on request libraries of fifty books to a room , from the third grade to the ninth , to be kept until the summer vacation , when they are returned for repairs and renewal . The number circulated during the school year has grown from 6,384 in 1899-1900 to 17,270 in 1912-13 . The children 's applications are sent to the main library , and no child may have a card there and in a school branch at the same time . There were rumors for several years that the library would be made free , and when it was at last announced in 1888 that $250,000 had been given by the late J. Pierpont Morgan , his father and two families related to them , on condition that $150,000 more should be raised by private subscription to remodel the Wadsworth Athenaeum , which then housed three libraries and a picture- gallery , and to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . That the money came in , is largely due to the personal efforts of Charles Hopkins Clark , editor-in-chief of the Hartford Courant , for many years treasurer of the Athenaeum , the Watkinson Library and the Hartford Public Library , and the sum required was promised in 1890 . Later the library offered the free use of its books , and also the income of about $50,000 to the city , on condition of keeping its form of government by a self-perpetuating corporation . The first step towards the enlarged use of the library was to separate the children 's books and classify them . We had had a fixed location up to that time , and I had not yet broken loose from it , but I numbered them according to the best light I had , though in a very short time I saw that with the increased number of duplicates we had to buy , only a movable location was of the least practical use . It was several years before the Dewey classification was finally adopted for the children , although we classified our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the library became free , in 1892 , the annual circulation of children 's books rose at once to 50,000 , 25 per cent of the whole , and as large as the largest total in the subscription days . We immediately had to buy a large supply of new books , carefully chosen , and printed a too fully annotated list , which we found useful for some years and discarded when we were able to open the shelves . We had only a corner for children 's books , almost none for children under ten , and no admission to the shelves . We struggled on as well as we could for the next few years . A dialogue between a reader and the librarian in 1897 shows what we were trying to do at this time . It is really true , and illustrates the lack of knowledge in one of the most intelligent women in the city of the many points of contact between the library and the boys and girls of the city . Reader : " There ought to be somebody in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read . " Librarian : " Have you ever seen the children 's printed list , with notes on books connected with school work , and others written for older readers but interesting to children , hints on how and what to read , and a letter R against the best books ? " Reader : " No , I never heard of it . " Librarian : " It was ready the day after the library opened , was sold for five cents , and the first edition of a thousand copies was exhausted so soon that a second had to be printed . Have you ever heard of the lists of interesting books in connection with Greek , Roman and English history given to high school pupils ' or the records kept for years by the North School children of books which they have read , and sent to the librarian to be commented on and criticised in an hour 's friendly talk in the school room , or the letters written on the use of the library by pupils in the other schools ? " Reader : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lists of good novels for boys and girls growing away from books written for children and also a list of interesting love-stories for readers who have heard of only a few authors ? " Reader : " No . " Librarian : " Have you ever noticed the printed lists of new books , with notes , hung on the bulletin board every Monday ? " Reader : " No . " Librarian : " Do you know that the library has twelve hundred volumes of the best books by the best authors , fifty of each , for use in the public schools ? " Reader : " No . " The library opened in 1895 a branch for children in the Social Settlement , and in 1897 reading rooms in connection with vacation schools , established by the Civic Club and afterwards taken in charge by the city . The Educational Club , an organization of parents , teachers and others interested in education , began in 1897 with very informal meetings , suggested by the school section of the Civic Club , which were held in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed a more formal organization . The directors of the Civic Club and managers of the Social Settlement have met there for years , and the Connecticut Public Library Committee found it a convenient meeting place until it seemed better to hold sessions in the Capitol , where its office is . The history classes of the North School , of whose principal I have spoken , used to make a pilgrimage every year to points of interest in the city , ending with an hour in the rooms of the Historical Society in the building , where they impersonated historical characters or looked at colonial furniture and implements . After the hour was over they used to come to the office for gingerbread and lemonade , which strengthened their friendly feeling for the library . This lasted until the principal went to another city . In 1898 , in a talk to some children in one of the schools just before the summer vacation , I asked those who were not going out of town to come to the library one afternoon every week for a book-talk , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find for themselves . The subjects the first year were : Out-of-door books and stories about animals , Books about Indians , Travellers ' tales and stories of adventure , Books that tell how to do things , Books about pictures and music , A great author and his friends ( Sir Walter Scott ) , Another great author and his short stories ( Washington Irving ) , Old-fashioned books for boys and girls . The talks have been kept up ever since . The series in 1900 was on Books about knights and tournaments , what happened to a man who read too much about knights ( Don Quixote ) , Books about horses , Two dream-stories , ( The divine comedy and The pilgrim 's progress ) , Some funny adventures ( A traveller 's true tale and others ) , Some new books , How a book is made , Stories about India , Pictures and scrap-books . The next year , 1901 , the talks were about stories connected with English history , the Old-English , the Normans , the Plantagenet times , King Henry V. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and King Henry VIII , Queen Elizabeth and Mary , Queen of Scots , the Stuarts , and the English Revolution and eighteenth- century England . The year after , 1902 , the talks were on " Books that you have not read , " under the titles Sea stories , Indian stories , Horse stories , Wonder stories , Hero stories , African stories , South Sea stories , School and college stories , Old stories . A table of books was in the room , and I took them up one by one and told a little about the story , sometimes reading aloud and stopping at a very interesting point . In 1903 , the subjects were Stories about dragons , Stories about soldiers , Stories about shipwrecks , Stories about out-of- doors , Stories of real people told by themselves , Stories about adventures , Stories about pictures , Stories about the West , the object being to give the children of the upper grammar grades a glimpse into interesting books of which they might otherwise never hear . In that year we printed a list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old and needs revision , but still has its uses . The use of the reference-room by children steadily increased , until the need of a room for them became evident , both on weekdays and Sundays . The Bulletin for March 1 , 1900 , says : " On Sunday , Feb. 25 , there were eighty-one children in the small room , filling not only chairs too high for their short legs , but benches extending into the circulation room . They were all quiet and orderly , and some of them read seriously and absorbedly for several hours on ' The twentieth century , ' ' The boundaries of the United States , ' and ' The comparative greatness of Napoleon and Alexander . ' The younger children read storybooks in the same quiet manner . A children 's room would relieve the pressure on all three departments of the library . " The " last straw " that led to the grant of rooms was a newspaper article illustrated by a photograph of the reference-room on a Sunday afternoon with one man , one woman and fifty-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into possession of two large , bright sunny rooms and a smaller one adjoining in an old-fashioned house next door , which belonged to the Athenaeum and had been released by the removal of the Hartford Club to a large new house across the street . We opened rooms in November , just before Thanksgiving , and from then till New Year 's Day we received gifts from many friends : a pair of andirons for the open fireplace , several pictures , a check " for unnecessary things " from one of the women 's clubs , another for wall-decoration from teachers , students and graduates of the Albany Library School , fifty Japanese color-prints of chrysanthemums from the Pratt Institute children 's room , a cuckoo clock that is still going , though it demands a vacation about once a year , and a Boston fern that is now in flourishing condition . A large Braun photograph of the Madonna del Granduca came later from the Pittsburgh School for Children 's Librarians . The furniture is of the simplest kind . We used some tables that we had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the older children and others such as are used in kindergartens for the younger . Pratt Institute lent us that first winter the very attractive illustrations by the Misses Whitney for Louisa Alcott 's " Candy country . " Some friends who were breaking up housekeeping gave the room a case of native and foreign stuffed birds with the hope that they might be as great a source of pleasure to the children as they had been to them in their childhood . Another friend sent us two trunks of curiosities from Europe , Asia , Africa and North America , which are shown a few at a time . The next summer , 1905 , the book-talks were about pictures in the room , most of which had been bought with our friends ' gifts . Windsor Castle , Kenilworth , Heidelberg Castle , The Alhambra , St. George , King Arthur , Sir Walter Scott , the Canterbury Pilgrims , some Shakespeare stories . On the Alhambra afternoon , a girl who had spent her first year out of college in Spain described the palace and showed curiosities from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in was persuaded to tell the boys and girls in the room about the three weeks she spent in the White House , taking care of Tad Lincoln through a fever . Some years later we were fortunate enough to hear her again in the room above , on Abraham Lincoln 's hundredth birthday , when she held the attention of a large number of boys and girls for more than an hour . The next summer " What you can get out of a Henty book " was used as an excuse for showing books and pictures about the Crusades , Venice , the knights of Malta , the Rebellion of the Forty-five , the East India Company , the siege of Gibraltar , the Peninsula war , and modern Italy . That summer we had a puzzle-club to show younger children how to work the puzzles in St. Nicholas and other magazines and newspapers . We held our first Christmas exhibition that year , 1906 , in the room itself , for one day only , before the hour of opening . After an exhibition of lace in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held the attention of her audience of girls between ten and fourteen , giving a practical illustration of the making of pillow-lace , showing specimens of different kinds , pointing out the use of lace in old-fashioned costumes for children , and exhibiting a piece of Valenciennes which had been stolen by a catbird and recovered before it was woven into a nest . This talk was given at my request , because we could find almost nothing on lace in books for children , and the exhibit was then attracting much notice . That year our first children 's librarian , who had given only a part of her working hours to the room , the rest to the loan-desk , left us to be married . The school work had grown so fast that it had become necessary for us to find a successor who was equal to it , and whose sole time could be given to that and the care of the room , which is open only from 3.30 to 6 on school-days , except on Wednesdays , Saturdays and in vacations , when we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day if they like  --  practically none of them do it  --  but in school time they are allowed only one a week . This is not a hardship , for they may use their non-fiction cards , which give them anything else , including bound magazines . Our children 's librarian makes up for lack of library technique by her acquaintance with teachers , and experience in day , evening and vacation schools , that have brought her into contact with children of all sorts and conditions . The summer before her coming I had charge of the room for a part of every day , and observing that children under fourteen were beginning to think that they had read everything in the room and were asking to be transferred , I made a collection of books , principally novels , from the main library , marked them and the bookcards with a red star , and placed them on side shelves , where the younger children soon learned that they would find nothing to interest them . This keeps the older boys and girls in the room until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are transferred they are sent to me in my office , where they are told that some one is always ready to give them help if they ask for it . The list of books for the first year after coming into the library is handed to them , and they are also referred to the high school shelves , to be mentioned later . We insist on a father or mother coming with a child and leaving a signature or mark on the back of the application-card . This is placing responsibility where it belongs , and as we always have at least one of the staff who can speak Yiddish , and others who speak Italian , the parents are usually willing to come . We are very strict in exacting fines as a means of teaching children to be responsible and careful of public property . One summer the children acted simple impromptu plays , Cinderella , Blue Beard , Beauty and the beast , on the lawn outside the long windows . The lawn has been in bad condition for nearly two years , on account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now been planted again . One May-day we had an old English festival around a Maypole on the green , with Robin Hood , Maid Marian , Friar Tuck , Will Scarlett , the hobby- horse , the dragon and all the rest , including Jack in the Green and an elephant . This was such a success that we were asked to repeat it across the river on the East Hartford Library green , where it was highly complimented on account of being so full of the spirit of play . Our Christmas exhibits have been held every year , at first , as I have said , for one day only , then for two or three in the rooms above , and for the last two years in a large room used by the Hartford Art Society as a studio until it moved to a whole house across the street . This room has space for our school libraries , and the room which they had outgrown was fitted up at no expense except for chairs and a change in the lighting , as a study-room for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reading any stories they find on the shelves , which are on one side only . The other shelves , placed across the room , were moved to the studio , which is so large that it has space for story-telling , or oftener story-reading . The winter of the Dickens centennial , through the month of February , the beginnings of " David Copperfield , " " Nicholas Nickleby , " " Dombey and son " and " Great expectations " were read . In 1911 , a gift of twenty-five dollars from a friend was spent for the boys ' and girls ' room , and has bought specimens of illustration , Grimm 's " Fairy tales , " illustrated by Arthur Rackham ; Kate Greenaway 's " Under the window , " " Marigold garden , " " Little Ann " and " Pied piper " , Laura Starr 's " Doll book , " and a fine copy of Knight 's " Old England , " full of engravings , including a morris dance such as has been performed here , and Hare 's " Portrait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the money bought a globe for the older boys ' and girls ' reading-table , and sent from Venice a reproduction of a complete " armatura , " or suit of Italian armor , eighteen inches high . In 1912 the boys and girls of grades 7 to 9 in the district and parochial schools were invited to listen to stories from English history in the Librarian 's office of the Hartford Public Library on Tuesday afternoons in July and August . Some of the subjects were The Roman wall , The Danish invasion , King Alfred and the white horses said to have been cut to commemorate his victories , The Crusades , and The captivity of James I. of Scotland . The Longman series of colored wall-prints was used as a starting point for the stories . Children in grades 4 to 6 listened at a later hour to stories from Hawthorne 's " Wonderbook " and " Tanglewood tales . " The Hartford Public Library had an exhibit at the state fair , September 2-7 , 1912 , in the Child-welfare building . In a space 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bookcase with libraries for school grades , probation office , and a settlement , and another with inexpensive books worth buying for children . Pictures of countries and national costumes were hung on the green burlap screens which enclosed the sides of the miniature room . At about the same time we printed a list of pleasant books for boys and girls to read after they have been transferred to the main library . They are not all classics , but are interesting . The head of the high school department of English and some of the other teachers asked the library 's help in making a list of books for suggested reading during the four years ' course . This list has been printed and distributed . Copies are hung near two cases with the school pennant above them , and one of the staff sees that these cases are always filled with books mentioned in it . The high school has a trained librarian , who borrows books from the Public Library and tries in every way to encourage its use . From Dec. 3 to 24 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and young people was kept open by the library in the large room in the annex . The exhibit included three or four hundred volumes , picture books by the best American , English , French , German , Italian , Danish , and Russian illustrators , inexpensive copies and also new and beautiful editions of old favorites , finely illustrated books attractive to growing-up young people , and the best of the season 's output . It had many visitors , some of them coming several times . We sent a special invitation to the students in the Hartford Art Society , some of whom are hoping to be illustrators , and appreciate the picture-books highly . The boys ' and girls ' room received last winter a fine photo-graphic copy of Leighton 's " Return of Persephone , " in time for Hawthorne 's version of the story , which is usually read when pomegranates are in the market and again six months later , when Persephone comes up to earth and the grass and flowers begin to spring . One day John Burroughs made an unexpected visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children reading at the tables were told who he was , and asked who of them had read " Squirrels and furbearers , " the boy nearest him held up his hand with the book in it . That boy will probably never forget his first sight of a real live author ! Last winter we received a gift of a handsome bookcase with glass doors , which we keep in the main library , filled with finely illustrated books for children to be taken out on grown-up cards only . This is to insure good care . For several years we have been collecting a family of foreign dolls , who are now forty-five in number , of all sorts and sizes , counting seventeen marionettes such as the poor children in Venice play with , half a dozen Chinese actors , and nine brightly colored Russian peasants in wood . The others are Tairo , a very old Japanese doll in the costume of the feudal warriors , Thora from Iceland , Marit the Norwegian bride , Erik and Brita from Sweden , Giuseppe and Marietta from Rome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cecilia from Hungary , Annetje from Holland , Lewie Gordon from Edinburgh , Christie Johnstone the Newhaven fishwife , Sambo and Dinah the cotton- pickers . Mammy Chloe from Florida , an Indian brave and squaw from British America , Laila from Jerusalem , Lady Geraldine of 1830 and Victoria of 1840 . Every New Year 's Day , in answer to a picture bulletin which announces a doll-story and says " Bring your doll , " the little girls come with fresh , clean , Christmas dolls , and every one who has a name is formally presented to the foreign guests , who sit in chairs on a table . Lack of imagination is shown in being willing to own a doll without a name , and this year the subject of names was mentioned in time for the little girls to have them ready . Mrs. Mary Hazelton Wade , author of many of the " Little cousins , " lives in Hartford , and lately gave us a copy of her " Dolls of many countries . " I told her about the party and invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening about the Feasts of Dolls in Japan . The doll-story was E. V. Lucas 's " Doll doctor , " and it was followed by William Brightly Rands 's " Doll poems . " In 1893 , the year after the library became free , the Connecticut Public Library Committee was organized . For about ten years it had no paid visitor and inspector , and I , as secretary of the committee , had to go about the state in the little time I could spare from regular duties , trying to arouse library interest in country towns . Now most of the field work is done by the visitor , but I have spoken many times at teachers ' meetings and library meetings . We began by sending out pamphlets  --  " What a free library can do for a country town "  --  emphasizing what its possibilities are of interesting children , and " What a library and school can do for each other . " Every year the libraries receive a grant of books from the state , and send in lists subject to approval . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for unworthy of being bought with state money by a committee appointed by the Board of Education , and began to print yearly lists of recommended titles of new books , from which all requested must be chosen . The standard is gradually growing higher . The Colonial Dames have for years paid for traveling libraries , largely on subjects connected with colonial history , to be sent to country schools from the office of the committee , and have also given traveling portfolios of pictures illustrating history , chosen and mounted by one of their number . The Audubon Society sends books , largely on out-of-door subjects , and bird-charts , to schools and libraries all over the state . Traveling libraries , miscellaneous or on special subjects , are sent out on request . A Library Institute has been held every summer for five years under the direction of the visitor and inspector . It lasts for two weeks , and several lectures are always given by specialists in work with children . The choice of books , sources of stories for children , and what to recommend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A book-wagon has for the last two or three years gone through a few towns where there is no public library , circulating several thousand books a year for adults and children , and exciting an interest which may later develop into the establishment of public libraries . The committee has now 105 which receive the state grant . Wherever a new library is opened , a special effort is made through the schools to make it attractive to children . At this time of year the mothers ' clubs in the city and adjoining towns often ask for talks on what to buy , and boxes of books are taken to them , not only expensive and finely illustrated copies , but the best editions that can be bought for a very little money . These exhibitions have been also given at country meetings held by the Connecticut Public Library Committee . A library column in a Hartford Sunday paper is useful in showing the public what libraries in other states and cities are doing , and in attracting attention to work with children . Letters to the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily paper and sent to the schools , invite them to book-talks . Other printed letters about visits to places connected with books and authors , sent home from England and Scotland with postcards , have excited an interest in books not always read by children . This year the Hartford children 's librarian has read the letters and shown the books referred to , post-cards and pictures , to a club of girls from the older grammar grades , who were invited through the letters just spoken of to leave their names with her . A club of children 's librarians from towns within fifteen miles around Hartford meets weekly from October to May . Meetings all over the state under the Public Library Committee have stimulated interest in work with children , and Library Day is celebrated every year in the schools . The visitor and inspector reports visits to eight towns in December , and says : " Somewhat more than a year ago , at the request of the supervisor , I made out a list of books for the X  --   --  school libraries . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school board requested my assistance in arranging the collection in groups to be sent in traveling library cases until each school shall have had each library . I spent two days at the town hall working with the chairman of the school board , the supervisor , a typist and two school teachers . " A new children 's room has been opened in the Y  --   --  library since my visit there . It is double the size of the room formerly in use , and much lighter and more cheerful . The first grant from the state was expended entirely for children 's books , the selection being made in this office . " In Z  --   --  I gave an Audubon stereopticon lecture , prefacing it with an account of the work on the Audubon Society , and an enumeration of the loans to schools . The audience in a country schoolhouse , half a mile from Z  --   --  village , numbered 102. " @# A CHAPTER IN CHILDREN 'S LIBRARIES @# The following account of the beginning of children 's work in Arlington , Mass. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the establishment of library work with children , and was written for the January , 1913 , number of The Library Journal . Alice M. Jordan was born in Thomaston , Maine , and was educated in the schools of Newton , Massachusetts . After teaching for a few years she entered the service of the Boston Public Library in 1900 , Since 1902 she has been Chief of the Children 's Department in that library , and since 1911 a member of the staff of Simmons College Library School . @# " In consequence of a grateful remembrance of hospitality and friendship , as well as an uncommon share or patronage , afforded me by the inhabitants of West Cambridge , in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , in the early part of my life when patronage was most needful to me , I give to the said town of West Cambridge one hundred dollars for the purpose of establishing a juvenile library in said town . The Selectmen , Ministers of the Gospel , and Physicians of the town of West Cambridge , for the time being shall receive this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which shall be such books as , in their opinion , will best promote useful knowledge and the Christian virtues among the inhabitants of the town who are scholars , or by usage have a right to attend as scholars in their primary schools . Other persons may be admitted to the privilege of said library under the direction of said town , by paying a sum for membership and an annual tax for the increase of the same . And my said executors are directed to pay the same within one year after my decease . " This " extract from the last will and testament of Dr. Ebenezer Learned , late of Hopkinton , N. H. , " forms the first book plate of the Arlington ( Mass . ) Public Library , founded in 1835 . It appears to be the earliest record we have of a specific bequest for a children 's library , free to all the children of the town receiving it . In the late eighteenth century it was the custom at Harvard College to grant a six-weeks ' vacation in winter and summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The popular way of doing this was to teach school . Ebenezer Learned , a young man in the class of 1787 , availed himself of this opportunity and taught in West Cambridge , or Menotomy . His associations there were pleasant ones , and the memory of the friends then made persisted through his later successful career . Dr. Learned became a practicing physician , first in Leominster ( Mass. ) and later in Hopkinton , N. H. He is said to have been warmly interested in education and science throughout his life , and was the originator of the New Hampshire Agricultural Society and vice-president of the New Hampshire Medical Society . And yet with all these later interests , his thought , toward the end of his life , was of the little town where he taught his first school . At the time of receiving this legacy there were in West Cambridge two ministers  --  a Unitarian and a Baptist  --  and one physician . Together with the selectmen , they formed the first board of trustees , which met on Nov. 30 , 1835 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as were directed by Dr. Learned 's will , " the same not being of a sectarian character . " Selection of books was left largely to Mr. Brown , of the newly formed firm of Little &; Brown , publishers . He was directed to spend at least half of the bequest for books suitable for the purpose , and these were sent to the home of Dr. Wellington , the physician on the board . Then followed the task of selecting a librarian , and the obvious choice was Mr. Dexter , a hatter by trade and already in charge of the West Cambridge Social Library . This was a subscription library , founded in 1807 , and consisting mainly of volumes of sermons and " serious reading . " The question of the librarian 's salary was the next care , for the state law authorizing towns to appropriate tax money for libraries was yet ten years in the future . At town meeting , in 1837 , however , one of the trustees called attention to the clause in Dr. Learned 's will which provided that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying a sum for membership and an annual assessment . " Why should not the town pay the tax , and thus make it free to all the inhabitants ? " he asked . And this was done . The town at once appropriated thirty dollars for the library , and the right to take books was extended to all the families in town . From this time the institution has been a free town library , the earliest of its class in Massachusetts . The little collection of books for the West Cambridge Juvenile Library traveled to its first home on a wheelbarrow . " Uncle " Dexter would make hats during the week , and on Saturday afternoons open the library for the children . Three books were the limit for a family , and they could be retained for thirty days . That the books were actually read by the children is vouched for by those who remember the library from its beginning . Even free access to the shelves was permitted for a while . But we come to a period , later , when the by-laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book from the shelves . " One would like to know just what those books were for which one-half of that precious bequest was first spent . The earliest extant catalog of the juvenile library is dated 1855 , though there exists an earlier list ( 1835 ) of the Social Library . Tradition has handed down the names of two books said to be in the first collection , but one of these is certainly of later date . The first is still in existence , a copy of the " History of Corsica , " by James Boswell . One who as a boy read this book , years ago , in the West Cambridge Juvenile Library , recalled it with delight when he visited Corsica years afterward . The other title , mentioned as belonging to the first library , is " The history of a London doll . " But this delightful child 's story , by Richard Hengist Home , was not published until 1846 . Some of the Waverley novels are also remembered as being among the earliest purchases . Of course , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Christian virtues " in school children are not necessarily children 's books . So we may be tolerably sure that Rollins ' and Robertson 's histories , as well as Goldsmith and Irving , would have appeared in the catalog had there been one . The juvenile library remained a year in its first home , the frame house still standing near the railroad which runs through Arlington . There have been five library homes since then , including the meeting house , where the collection of books was nearly doubled by the addition of the district school libraries and a part of the Social Library . In 1867 the town changed its name to Arlington , discarding the Indian name of Menotomy , by which it was known before its incorporation as West Cambridge . The library then became known as the Arlington Juvenile Library , and , in 1872 , its name was formally changed to Arlington Public Library . With the gift of a memorial building , in 1892 , the present name , the Robbins Library , was adopted by the town . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given us , that we have lost sight of this first children 's library . Not Brookline in 1890 , not New York in 1888 , but Arlington in 1835 marks the beginning of public library work with children . Here is one public library , with a history stretching back over seventy-five years , which need not apologize for any expenditure in its work with children . Its very being is rooted in one man 's thought for the children of the primary schools . Dr. Learned could think of no better way of repaying the kindnesses done to a boy than by putting books into the hands of other boys and girls . A children 's librarian may well be grateful for the memory of this far-seeing friend of children , who held the belief that books may be more than amusement , and that the civic virtues can be nourished by and in a " juvenile library . " @# THE CHILDREN 'S LIBRARY IN NEW YORK @# The leading editorial in The Library Journal for May , 1887 , says : " The plan of providing good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the work of the Children 's Library Association , outlined in a paper in this number , may prove to be the start of a movement of great social importance . " This interesting personal account was written by Miss Emily S. Hanaway , principal of the primary department of Grammar School No. 28 , in New York City , to whom came the thought , " Why not give the children reading-rooms ? " , and through whose efforts the Association was organized . Emily S. Hanaway was married in 1891 to the Reverend Peter Stryker . She died in 1915 in her eightieth year . Her library was ultimately forced to close its doors , but its influence remains . @# For several years it had caused me much pain to find that many of the children in our school were either without suitable reading or were reading books of a most injurious kind . The more I pondered the matter the more I became convinced that much of the poison infused into the mind of a child begins at a very early age . As soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be formed . Give him only common comic or sensational ones , and he will seize them and look no higher . On the other hand , give him finely-wrought sketches and paintings , tell him to be very careful how he handles them , and he will despise the trash of the present day . Place in his hand clear print , and he will never want the vile copy of a sensational paper often thrown in at our doors . Place in his hand Babyland , tell him that he is an annual subscriber , and the importance of having his name printed on the copy will induce him to do as a little relative of mine has frequently done . He will run after the postman and ask him how long before the next number will arrive . Upon one occasion we endeavored to find out what sort of books our school-children were reading , and asked them to bring a few for us to examine . Some of them , having been directed in their reading by discreet , faithful parents , brought such periodicals as St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while others brought the vilest kind of literature , and one little fellow brought a large copy of the " Annual Report of the Croton Aqueduct . " In the summer of 1885 , while seated in a room where the National Association of Teachers had assembled , a thought , as if some one had leaned over my shoulder and suggested it , came suddenly into my mind : " Why not give the children reading- rooms ? " There was no getting rid of the thought . All that afternoon and evening it followed me . After the meeting , in the evening , I asked Prof. E. E. White , of Ohio , if he thought such an undertaking could be carried out . He answered , " Yes ; but it is gigantic . " I came home fully persuaded that it must be tried ; but where should I begin ? As soon as school opened in September , it occurred to me that almost opposite our school- building there was a day-nursery , the lady in charge of which appeared to be a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help , as she had a small library at that time , which her children used in the nursery . On visiting the publishers , generous donations were promised from Treat , Scribner , Taintor &; Merrill , Barnes , and others . These were sent to the nursery . A few years before , a former principal in our school , Miss Victoria Graham , had worked with great energy to have a library in P. D. , G. S. 28 , and the proceeds of an entertainment given in 1872 in the Academy of Music had furnished two or three hundred books . Miss Graham died the same year , and as we had no regular librarian , many of the books were lost . About sixty were left . These also were sent to the nursery , and our children went over every week to draw books . This was the first attempt . But we felt that it was but a small beginning , and that if we wished to bring in all creeds we must free the public mind from suspicion , and have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hebrew . Accordingly , we planned that when a committee should be organized , every religious faith should be represented among those who were to choose the books . As we wished to have many of these rooms throughout the city , and as our friends at the day-nursery , under their arrangements , could not have a committee , we thought it would do no harm to start anew . So we conferred with the various clergymen of all denominations , in a neighborhood well known to us , and received great encouragement . Dr. Mendez became a member of our organization committee , and has been present at very many of our business meetings . We then visited the persons named by these gentlemen , for our organization committee , and when we had found eleven willing to serve , a kind friend in West 22d St. , Mrs. Hanford Smith , gave us the use of her parlors for our meeting . A more gloomy committee has been seldom seen . " Have you a room for a library ? " was asked . " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Any books ? " " No . " " Absurd ! How do you expect to start such a work ? " " On faith . " Next a vote was taken whether to organize or not . It was decided to organize . Mr. Edward Chichester was elected president , Mr. Edward Vanderbiit secretary , and Mr. E. P. Pitcher to the very responsible position of treasurer , without a cent in the treasury . Here it is only due to Rev. Dr. Terry to speak of the encouragement he gave . The Y. M. C. A. connected with the South Reformed Church , on 21st St. and 5th Ave. , were talking of taking rooms at 243 9th Ave. , for a young men 's club , and through the doctor 's efforts we were allowed to come into these rooms from 4 to 6 p. m. , all through the season , from December to May , with the understanding that we might pay or not , according to our success in obtaining funds . One trouble was over . We then began our circuit once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publishing-house named in the directory , beside making many personal visits to friends , who encouraged us by gifts of books . We are largely indebted to Dodd , Mead &; Co. , Carter , Taintor , Merrill &; Co. , and many others , who have given most liberally ; also to friends , who have given us many $5 bills , and enabled us not only to pay expenses , including librarian , tickets of admission , covers for books , circulars , etc. , but also to hand over most joyfully to Dr. Terry $40 for the use of room at the close of the season . Last fall we tried to begin our work once more , and after walking from 40th to 23d St. , along 8th and 9th Avenues , I at last found rooms on W. 35th Street . Dr. Terry kindly loaned us furniture , and the Women 's Christian Temperance Union shared with us the modest rent of $13 per month , $6.50 each . Last year P. D. No. 45 , in West 24th St. , sent a large representation from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickets . We had about 350 books , and issued about 700 admission tickets . At one time during the winter the librarian sent me this message : " Only eight books are left on the shelves . Do you think it best to close the room to-day ? " I returned word : " Get in all the books you can ; do not give out any for a short time , but let the children come in and look at the stereoscopic views , play games , look at or read pamphlets . When they have returned a sufficient number , begin to distribute again . " That week we received several parcels of books , and started up again . We had applications for tickets from P. D. , G. S. No. 11 , 37th St. Prim . Deptt , 34th St. R. Ch . S. School , Ind . School , West 415t St. , and others . Male Dep't , G. S. No. 67 , asked for 91 tickets . Some of the children in P. D. , G. S. No. 28 , shed tears when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The children stood on the sidewalk on a Friday afternoon , not long ago , from 2:30 until 5:30 , patiently waiting for their turn to enter the room , as the librarian could only allow a certain number to enter at one time . Dr. Barnett visited the rooms with the intention of putting up chest-expanders for exercise , but he found them too small , and the woodwork too frail , for any such purposes . We have a number of subscribers at $1 per year , although some have gone far beyond this in subscriptions . We closed on May 1 , to reopen in the fall . One great reason for keeping open through the year is that many parents are obliged to work all day , and the children run the risk of getting into all sorts of crime . As an instance , not long since I found a little girl in our department who had been frequently caught pilfering . At last we thought it necessary to send for the mother . She burst into tears and said : " What am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until I return , and I do not know what they are doing . " I asked if the children had tickets for the reading-room , and here found another difficulty . " Not on the same day , " she said . We had been obliged to send the girls on three days of the week , and the boys on two days , because of the lack of room , and of helpers . Several teachers have since come forward and offered their services . Two teachers in our department have gone every Monday , and two others every Friday , and appeared to take great pleasure in the work . All honor to such young , earnest workers , for they deserve it ! We have recently received a box of books , toys , etc. , from the " Little Helpers " in Elyria , Ohio , and Columbia College is taking an active interest in our work . We are leaning upon our friends of the college library for support and help , in time to come . All our meetings are held at Columbia College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite sure  --  yes , as sure as we felt on that gloomy evening last winter , when we decided to go on  --  that from the kind words of encouragement , and the liberal gifts that we have received in the past , the gifts are coming in the future ; and when we are resting from our labors , others yet unborn shall rise up and call those blessed who have strengthened our hands . And we believe that when this comes the prison doors will open less frequently . @# THE WORK FOR CHILDREN IN FREE LIBRARIES @# In the following paper , read in 1897 before the Friends ' Library Association of Philadelphia , and the New York Library Club , Miss Mary W. Plummer discussed some of the " experiences and theories " of a number of libraries and the " requisites for the ideal children 's library . " Mary Wright Plummer was born in Richmond , Indiana , in 1856 , was graduated from the Friends ' Academy there , and was a special student at Wellesley College , 1881-1882 . She entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in 1888 became a certified graduate of the Library School of Columbia College . For the next two years she was the head of the Cataloguing department of the St. Louis Public Library . She was Librarian of the Pratt Institute Free Library from 1890 to 1904 , and Director of the Pratt Institute of Library Science until 1911 . She then became Principal of the Library School of the New York Public Library , the position she held until her death in 1916 . Miss Plummer was President of the A. L. A. in 1915-1916 . She contributed many articles to library periodicals , and has written numerous books , several of which are for children . @# It is so early in the movement for children 's libraries that by taking some thought now it would seem possible to avoid much retracing of steps hereafter , and it is for this reason that even at this early day a comparison of experiences and theories by those libraries which have undertaken the work is desirable and even necessary . It is as well , perhaps , to begin with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last December and from perusal of the Library Journal reports since then . Many libraries , probably the majority , have had an age-limit for borrowers , and the admission of children under 12 to membership is of comparatively recent date . The separation of children from the adult users of the library by means of a room of their own was probably originated by the Public Library of Brookline , which in 1890 set aside an unused room in its basement for a children 's reading-room . In 1893 the Minneapolis Public Library fitted up a library for children , from which books circulate also , where they had ( as reported in December , 1896 ) 20,000 volumes , the largest children 's library yet reported . In 1894 the Cambridge Public Library opened a reading-room and the Denver Public Library a circulating library for children . An article on the latter undertaking may be found in the Outlook for September 26 , 1896 . In 1895 Boston , Omaha , Seattle , New Haven and San Francisco , all opened either circulating libraries or reading-rooms for children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institute of Brooklyn , Everett ( Mass. ) and Kalamazoo ( Mich. ) followed suit . The libraries of Circleville ( O. ) , Milwaukee , Cleveland , and Helena ( Mont. ) are all projecting plans for the same , and probably this year will show a notable increase . The new Public Library of Chicago has made no especial provision for children , from the fact that its situation in the heart of the business district of the city will prevent many children from coming to it , but provision of some sort will be made for them at the various branch reading-rooms throughout the city . In the new building of the Providence Library considerations of cost made it necessary to give up the addition of a children 's library , a matter of great disappointment to every one . From all these libraries except the last two , reports were received by us in December , 1896 , on comparing which we found considerable similarity of usage , though as there had been but little in print on the subject up to 1896 this probably arose not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like circumstances and causes produced like effects in different places . Of the 15 libraries reporting , 11 circulated books from the children 's room , three making an age-limit for this , while the four remaining contented themselves with giving the children a reading-room , in which a number of books  --  about 300  --  were placed , for reading on the premises . The temptation for a child who becomes interested in a book , to carry it off when closing- hour comes , in order to finish it , is a strong one , and of these four libraries one reported 35 books missing in its first six months , or over one-tenth of its stock . Two others which circulate from open shelves to all borrowers lost 100 children 's books in a little over 12 months . A number of others reported that as yet they had taken no inventory of the books in the room , and were evidently willing that ignorance should remain bliss a little longer . Several report that very few books are unaccounted for , and one or two that not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children 's books is allowed in all the 15 , and in about half of them the room is open all day , and in two cases in the evening also . The number of volumes shelved ranges all the way from 300 to 20,000 , the average number being from 3,000 to 4,000 . An age-limit for the use of the room is set by seven libraries , three of these making the limit for circulation only , while eight admit children of any age , and doubtless make provision for the very youngest The circulation of these rooms that lend books ranges from 65 to 350 as a daily average , frequently exceeding this . As a rule , one attendant is kept in the room , with assistance when necessary , two libraries only reporting two regular assistants and the Boston Public Library three . The Detroit Library has two attendants in order to give the children personal attention . The library at Kalamazoo has for one of its assistants a trained kindergarten . Eight libraries report no reference-books on the children 's shelves and the majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of periodicals taken appears to be our own list of 10 , though by this time the libraries reporting in 1896 may have increased their number . Instead of taking a variety of periodicals , they seem to prefer duplicating a few favorites . One library reports a number of copies of Puck taken for children , the wisdom of which I should doubt , and two subscribe for Golden Days . The Minneapolis Library circulates 10 copies of St. Nicholas . The Boston Public Library , having a large foreign clientele among children as well as adults , takes one German and one French periodical for them . In the Detroit Library the Scientific American is on the list , and in our children 's library we take a copy of Harper 's Weekly . A number of libraries report crowding and lack of time and space . In one no periodicals can be kept in the children 's library , because there is no room for the children to sit down to read them . Another reports as many as 75 children frequently in the room at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have often to be sent out , and a fourth , which at the time was only a reading-room , that the attendance was so large very little could be done except to keep order . Most of the libraries report a fair proportion of foreigners among the children , and one speaks of having many colored children among the readers . Turning from these reports to a general consideration of the subject , we must admit , first , that a definite decision as to the object of a children 's library is the first thing needful . This decision will doubtless vary in different libraries , and the results will differ accordingly , but almost any decision is better than none , since one can not be arrived at without giving much thought to the subject , and the desirable thing is that the work should be entered upon thoughtfully . We have passed the time when reading in itself was considered a vast good . The ability to read may easily be a curse to the child , for unless he be provided something fit to read , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . When we consider the dime-novels , the class of literature known as Sunday- school books , the sensational newspapers , the vicious literature insinuated into schools , and the tons of printed matter issued by reputable publishers , written by reputable people , good enough in its intention but utterly lacking in nourishment , and , therefore , doing a positive harm in occupying the place of better things  - -  when we consider that all these are brought within a child 's reach by the ability to read , we can not help seeing that the librarian , in his capacity as selector of books for the library , has the initial responsibility . Certain classes of the printed stuff just spoken of do not , of course , find their way into children 's libraries , since they are barred out from all respectable shelves ; but we are still too lenient with print because it is print , and every single book should be carefully examined before it goes into a library where children should have access to the shelves . But given an ideal selection of books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still have enough books to go around , is just the reading of them  --  that is , the passing of the eye over the types , gaining a momentary impression  --  the most desirable thing to be got out of them ? Are there not here and there children who are reading to the lasting detriment of their memories and powers of observation and reflection , stuffing themselves with type , as it were ? Nearly every observant librarian knows of such cases . Are there not days when the shining of the sun , the briskness of the air , the greenness of the turf and of the trees , should have their invitation seconded by the librarian , and the child be persuaded AWAY from the library instead of TO it ? We are supposed to contribute with our books toward the sound mind , but we should be none the less advocates of the sound body  --  and the child who reads all day indoors when he ought to be out in the fresh air among his kind , should have our especial watching . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what do we know of the effect our books are having ? We count our circulation just the same whether a book is kept two days  --  about long enough for the family to look at the pictures  --  or a week . Whether it has been really read we do not know . Sometimes I think those pencilled notes on the margin , recording the child 's disgust or satisfaction , should have more meaning for us than they do . At least , they prove that the book has taken hold of the reader 's imagination and sympathies . Do n't let us be too severe with a criticism written in the honest feeling of the moment ( if it be in pencil ) ; we are really gathering psychological and sociological data for which the child-study clubs would thank us , perhaps . I see only one way in which we can be enabled to estimate fairly the value of what we are doing , and that is by so gaining the good-will and confidence of the children as to get them to answer our questions as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accord what they get from it . From this information we may make our inferences as to the value of our books in themselves , and may be enabled to regulate their use . A child whose exclusive diet is fairy-tales is evidently over-cultivating the imagination ; a girl who has outgrown children 's books and dipped into the premature love-stories that are written for her class needs our most careful guidance ; a boy whose whole thought is of adventure , or who can not read anything but jokes , is also in a critical condition . In short , the judicious regulation of the children 's reading should be made practicable for the librarian , if the children 's library is to be the important agency in education which it may be made . In regard to the desirability of amusements in the library , I own that I am somewhat sceptical . The library has its own division of labor in the work of education , and that division is the training of the people to the use and appreciation of books and literature . An argument in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not otherwise come , but I should fear they would be drawn in finally in such crowds as to be unmanageable . Books properly administered should have the same drawing power , and their influence , once felt , is toward quietness and thought , rather than toward activity and skill with the complications of dispute and cheating that may arise from the use of games . Children are natural propagandists . Let one child find that at the children 's library he may select his own books from a good-sized collection , may find help in his composition-work , the news of what is going on in the world in the shape of an attractive illustrated bulletin-board , different every week  --  and tomorrow 10 children will know of it , and each of these will tell other 10 , and so on . The library will have all the children it can attend to eventually , and they will have come gradually so that the assistants shall have been able to get a proper grasp of the situation , while the earlier children will have been somewhat trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family . Certain freedoms may be granted in the children 's library as an education for the adult constituency of the future ; for instance , the guarantee may be done away with , thus putting the child on his honor to pay his own fines and damages  --  the only penalties for not doing so being those which society naturally inflicts on offenders  --  the debarring from privileges and from association . If there is nothing injurious or doubtful on the shelves , freedom in choice of books may be allowed to the smallest child , only he must know that help and guidance are at hand if he wishes them , and if a tendency to over-read in any one direction or in all is noticed , the librarian should feel at liberty to make suggestions . And as to freedom of action , the maxim should be that one man 's liberty ends where another man 's begins . No child should be allowed to disturb the room or to interfere with the quiet of those who are studying , for many children , more than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiffness and enforced routine of the school-room should by all means be avoided . There should be no set rules as to silence , but consideration for others should be inculcated , and in time the room will come to have a subduing , quiet atmosphere that will insensibly affect those who enter . Whispering , or talking in a low tone , where several little heads are bent together over picture-books , is certainly admissible , and the older heads are very soon quiet of their own accord , each over its own book or magazine . After the selection of the books themselves there is nothing so important as thoughtful administration , a practical question , since the employment of assistants comes in under this head . Educators have for some time seen the mistake of putting the cheapest teachers over the primary schools  --  kindergartners have seen it  --  and it remains for the library to profit by their experience without going through a similar one . If there is on the library staff an assistant well read and well educated , broad- minded , tactful , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and person , possessed , in short , of all desirable qualities , she should be taken from wherever she is , put into the children 's library , and paid enough to keep her there . There is no more important work in the building , no more delicate , critical work than that with children , no work that pays so well in immediate as well as in far-off results . Who that has met the fault- finding , the rudeness and coldness too frequent in a grown-up constituency , would not expand in the sunshine of the gratitude , the confidence , the good-will , the natural helpfulness of children ! And it rests partly with the assistant to cultivate these qualities in them , and so modify the adult constituency of the future . I say THOUGHTFUL administration because the children 's library is no sooner opened than it begins to present problems . Some of these are simply administrative and economic , others take hold of social and ethical foundations . There will be scarcely a day on which the librarian and the children 's librarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hearts , together over puzzling cases  --  cases of fraud , of mischief-making , of ignorant evil-doing , of inherited tendencies , physical , mental , and moral  --  and sometimes it will seem as if the whole human creation were incurably ailing , and the doctrine of total depravity will take on alarming probability . But at this point some sound , smiling , active boy or girl comes in with a cheerful greeting , and pessimism retires into the background . And all this reminds me of one more quality which the children 's librarian must have  --  a sense of humor . It is literally saving in some circumstances . Our own experience has led to the following suggestions , made by the children 's librarian in our library to those who come in at given hours from the other departments to take her place or to assist her . It will be seen that most of them are the product of observation and thought arising from the daily evidence of the room itself : " Always tell a child how to fill out his application-blank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write his name in the register and stay near him till it is completed . Whenever it is possible , go to the shelves with a child who has just received his card of membership . Show him where different kinds of books are to be found . Ask him what kind of book he likes . Show him one or two answering to his description and then leave him to make his own selection . " Explain the routine carefully and fully to children just beginning to use the library . " Let no child sign the register , look at a book , receive or present an application , with soiled hands . Soiled and crumpled applications are considered defective and can not be accepted . " Do not expect or demand perfect quiet . Frequent tapping upon the desk excites the children and betrays nervousness on the part of the person in charge . Let the discipline of the room seem to be incidental ; let the child feel that it is first and foremost a library where books are to be had for the asking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get them . " Never call children 's numbers , but use their names if necessary , though a glance of recognition pleases them better . Do not force acquaintance . Children like it even less than grown people . Be sympathetic and responsive , but beware of mannerism or effusiveness . Remember , too , that questioning is a fine art , and one should take care not to offend . " Speed is not the first requisite at a children 's desk . Children have more patience with necessary formalities than grown people . " Let some of the children help in the work of the room , but do not urge them to do so . " Avoid stereotyped forms of expression when reproving a child or conversing with him . Let him feel you are speaking to him personally ; he will not feel this if he hears the same words used for 50 other boys . " For evening work , when there is no circulation of books : " read to them sometimes ; talk to them at others ; and sometimes leave them quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are leaving work to give them pleasure than they would be if they found you were making their pleasure your work . " These are a few of the instructions or suggestions consequent upon daily observation and experience . Doubtless every children 's librarian could supplement them with many more , but they are enough to show what I mean by " thoughtful administration . " Occasionally the librarian who serves children will have to take account of stock , sum up the changes for better or for worse in the use and treatment of the room , in the manners and habits of the children and in their reading . She will have to retire a little from her work , take a bird's-eye view of it , and decide if on the whole progress is making toward her ideal . Without identifying itself with any of the movements such as the kindergarten , child-study , and social settlement , without losing control of itself and resigning itself to any outside guidance , the children 's library should still absorb what is to its purpose in the work of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the librarian may have to keep reminding herself , to keep from being drawn off into other issues , but by standing a little apart she may see what is to her advantage without being sucked in by the draft as some enthusiastic movement sweeps by . Must she have no enthusiasm ? Yes , indeed ; but is not that a better enthusiasm which enables one to work on steadily for years with undiminished courage than the kind that exhausts itself in the great vivacity of its first feeling and effort ? It will not be long after the opening of the children 's library before an insight will be gained into domestic interiors and private lives that will make the librarian wish she could follow many a child to his home , in order to secure for him and his something better than the few hours ' respite from practical life which they may get from the reading of books . When the boy who steals and the girl who is vicious before they are in their teens , have to be sent away lest other children suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff of home-missionaries connected with the library to follow up and minister in such cases would not be a bad thing  --  and she has to remind herself again and again that it is not incumbent on any one person to attempt everything , and that Providence has other instrumentalities at work besides herself . The humors of the situation , on the other hand , are many . The boys who , being sent home to wash their hands , return in an incredibly short time with purified palms and suppressed giggles , and on persistent inquiry confess , " We just licked ' em , " present to one who is " particular " only a serio-comic aspect ; and the little squirrel who wriggles to the top of the librarian 's chair until he can reach her ear , and then whispers into it , " There could n't be no library here ' thout you , could there ? " is not altogether laughable ; but incidents of pure comedy are occasionally to be set over against the serious side . Last spring , with a view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and indirectly in the light the answers should throw on the character of the children , we chose 150 boys and girls who were regularly using the library and sent to them a series of questions to be answered in writing . They were apparently greatly pleased to be consulted in this way , and it seemed to us that very few of the replies were insincere in tone , or intended merely to win approbation . From the 100 replies worth any consideration I have drawn these specimen answers : One of the first questions we asked was , " How long have you been using the library ? " Of 100 who answered , 25 had used the library more than six months , 33 more than a year , 22 more than two years , 11 more than three years , nine more than four years , and one six years , since books were first given out to children . Many children first hear of the library when they are 13 and over , and after 14 they have the use of the main library , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorter . However , if a child has not done with the children 's library by the time he is 14 , we allow him to continue using it until he wishes to be transferred . Of 100 children , 68 reported that other members of their families used the library , while 32 reported themselves the only borrowers . This is interesting in connection with their answers to the question , " Does any one at home or at school tell you good books to read ? " 71 reported yes and 29 no , about the same proportion . In many families the parents are of a mental calibre or at a stage in education to enjoy books written for children , and we have found that children often drew books with their parents ' tastes in view . One little girl whose own tastes led her to select a charming little book on natural history was sent back with it by an aunt who said it was not suitable and requested one of the semi-demi-novels that are provided for quite young girls , as being much more appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case where grown people are thus influencing children injuriously can be fully appreciated only by one who knows and cares for the children . Fifty-seven children reported that they were read to at home or that they read to their younger brothers and sisters , while 43 stated that their reading was a pleasure all to themselves . The large number who shared their reading was a pleasant surprise to us , evincing a companionship at home that we had hardly anticipated . Twenty-eight children stated that they preferred to have help in selecting their books , 63 that they preferred to make their own choice , while nine said it depended . 49 said that they came to the library to get help in writing their compositions or in other school-work , while 51 said they did not , one proudly asserting , " I am capable of writing all my compositions myself , " and another , seeming to think help a sort of disgrace , " I do not come to the library for help about anything at all . " Seventy out of the 100 children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of their Sunday-school libraries also . An inquiry as to the books read since New Year 's , the questions being sent out in May , brought out the fact that an average of six books in the four and a half months had been read  --  not a bad average , considering that it was during term-time in the schools , when studies take up much of the child 's otherwise spare time . Boys proved to prefer history and books of adventure , travel and biography , to any other class of reading ; girls , books about boys and girls , fairy stories and poetry . The tastes of the boys on the whole were more wholesome , and the girls need most help here . It is not at all unlikely that it is chiefly the wars and combats in history which make it interesting to the boys , as they seem to go through a sanguinary phase in their development that nothing else will satisfy ; but many of them will get their history in no other way , and since wars have been prominent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact . Fairness to both sides would seem to be the essential in the writing of these children 's histories and historical tales , since the ability to stop and deliberate and to make allowances is rare even in grown people and needs cultivation . The question as to the best book the child had ever read brought in a bewildering variety of answers , proving beyond a doubt that there had been no copying or using of other children 's opinions . While no list can be given , the reasons they offered in response to a request for them were often interesting . Girls wrote of " Little women " : " It is so real , the characters are so real and sweet . " " I feel as if I could act the whole book . " " This story has helped me a very great deal in leading a better and a happier life . " " It shows us how to persevere , " etc . Boys like " The Swiss family Robinson " " because it describes accurately the points of a shipwreck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the best of everything . " Another , " because it shows how some people made the most of what they had . " Another , " It shows how progressive the people were . " One liked " Uncle Tom 's cabin " " because it describes life among the colored people and shows how they were treated before the war " ; another , " because it is a true story and some parts of it are pitiful and other parts are pleasant . " A boy of 12 says of " Grimm 's fairy tales , " " They are interesting to read , and I learn there is no one to give you wings and sandals to fly  --  you have to make your own . " Another likes " John Halifax " " because it tells how a boy who had pluck obtained what he wanted and made his mark in the world . " " Pluck , " I imagine , in a boy 's mind stands for the old virtue of the poets , " magnanimity , " that included all the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they tell me about different kinds of people 's ways , about animals , and a little about history . " Another child " learned games out of them , and how to tell the truth and the use of the truth . " A child of eight puts in a pathetic plea worth considering for the Prudy books , " because I understand them better than any books I have read . " An incipient author says that she uses the library because " I make a good deal of stories and find pretty ideas . " Perhaps the most enlightening replies came in answer to the question , " Can you suggest anything which would make the library more interesting that it is now ? " One delightfully reassuring boy says , " I like the children 's library to stay just the same , and a boy who never went there would like it . I 'll bring more boys . " " Pictures of art " are requested , and " a set of curiosities from all parts of the world . " As we regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk on our busy days we sometimes think we already have this latter item . " A prize for the best story every month . " " More histories . " " Pictures of noted men on the walls . " " More fairy-tales . " " More magazines . " " Books showing how to draw . " " A pencil fastened to each table . " " Stories in Scottish history . " " More books of adventure . " " More funny books . " " A chart of real and genuine foreign stamps . " " Lectures for children between 10 and 14 , with experiments accompanying them . " " A one-hour lecture once a week by noted men on different subjects . " " A book giving the value of celebrated paintings . " " More books . The shelves look bare , " as indeed they do after a rush-day . " Rules to keep the children in order , " from a nine-year-old who has doubtless suffered . " Not to be disturbed by other boys for unknown crimes , " says one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Catholic books . " " Tanks with fishes , in the windows . " " An aquarium ; children would enjoy seeing pollywogs change to frogs every time they came to the library . " This is the comment of a little girl , I am glad to say . " School-books . " " More amusement for little children . " This was before we bought our linen picture-books . And the " Elsie books , " and Oliver Optic , and Castlemon are vainly desired by two or three . The general sentiment is pretty well voiced by one child who says , " The library is just perfect in about every respect . " We feel that with this enumeration of desiderata , the children 's library has its work cut out for it for some time to come , and that these evidences of the children 's likings and needs have removed a certain vagueness from our ambitions . With lectures and experiments , reading clubs , and possibly original stories , in contemplation , there is no danger of rust from inaction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious obstacles to overcome . But always and everywhere the library should put forward its proper claim of the value and use of the book  --  though in the word book I by no means include all that goes under the name . If there are lectures with experiments or lantern-slides , they should be attended by information as to the best literature on the subject and the children encouraged to investigate what has been printed , as well as to take in through the ear . There is no " digging " in lecture-going , and it is " digging " that leaves a permanent impression on the mind . The lecture should stimulate to personal research . From reading aloud together at the library in the evening , reading clubs may come to be formed , each with a specialty , decided by the tastes of the members . The writing of stories , particularly if the library selected the subject , might be made the occasion of the use of histories , biographies , travels , etc . Quiet games in the evening for the older children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be strictly within the library 's province . Personal talks with the children about their reading , if judiciously conducted , are always in order . With a generation of children influenced in this way to use books as tools and a mental resource as well as for recreation , and to find recreation only in the best-written books , the library constituency of the future would be worthy of the best library that could be imagined . The bulletin-board is attracting attention generally as a means of interesting children in topics of current interest , and such a periodical as Harper 's Weekly is invaluable when it comes to securing illustrations for this purpose . Sandwiched in among the pictures , we have occasionally smuggled in a printed paragraph of useful information or a set of verses , and our latest move , to induce more general reading of the periodicals , has been to analyze their contents on the bulletin , under the head of " Animals , " " Sports , " " Engines , " " Short stories , " " Long stories , " etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to turn to this analysis to see if there is anything new on their favorite topic and to explain the workings of the board to other boys , and the desired end is gradually being brought about . As the references are taken down to make way for new ones , they are filed away by subject , making the beginnings of a permanent reference list . Birds , the new magazine with its colored plates , is a boon for the children 's room , The Great Round World is good for the assistant-in-charge and the teachers who come to the room , as well as for the children . In order to add to the number of books without overstepping our rules as to quality , we are beginning , though not yet very systematically , to look over the works of certain authors of grown-up books with a view to finding material that can be understood sufficiently by children to interest them . A number of Stevenson 's books can be given to boys and girls , and we hope to find many others . Most children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written them , and if we can induce them to learn to know authors and can interest them in a writer like Stevenson , we can feel fairly secure that they will not drop him when they are transferred from the children 's room to the main library . Perhaps it is best always to have a working hypothesis to begin with , in children 's libraries as elsewhere ; but we can assure those who have not tried it that facts are stubborn things , and the hypothesis has frequently to be made over in accordance with newly-observed facts , and theories may or may not be proven correct . The whole subject is as yet in the empirical stage , and the way must be felt from day to day . If the children 's librarian lives in a continual rush , what " leisure to grow wise " on her chosen subject does she have ? and if she is hurried constantly from one child to another , what chance have the children for learning by contact with the individual ? which , as Mr. Horace E. Scudder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This contact may be had most naturally , it seems to us , through the ordinary channels of waiting on the children , provided it is quiet , deliberate waiting upon them . We go out of our way to think out new philanthropies and are too likely to forget that , as we go about our every-day business , natural opportunities are constantly presenting for strengthening our knowledge of and our hold upon the people who come to us  --  who are sent to us , I might almost say . The registry and the charging-desks offer chances for acquaintance to begin naturally and unconsciously and for much incidental imparting of seed-thoughts . And it is in these every-day chances , if appreciated and made the most of , that the work of the children 's library is going to tell . The necessity of especial training in psychology , pedagogy , child study , and kindergarten ideas , has been treated of recently in a paper before the A. L. A. There is no doubt that the " called " worker in this field will be better for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure of the call . It is quite as serious as one to the ministry , if not more so , and no amount of intellectual training will make up for the lack of patience and fairness and of a genuine interest in children and realization of their importance in the general scheme . To sum up , the requisites for the ideal children 's library , as we begin to see it , are suitable books , plenty of room , plenty of assistance , and thoughtful administration . Better a number of children 's libraries scattered over a town or city than a large central one , since only in this way can the children be divided up so as to make individual attention to them easy . But if it devolves upon one library to do the work for the entire town , and branches are out of the question , something of the same result may be obtained by providing at certain hours an extra number of assistants . I can imagine a large room with several desks , at each of which should preside an assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in time she might come to be an authority on historical or biographical or scientific or literary books for children , and the children might learn to go to her as their specialist on the class of books they cared most for . Perhaps this may sound Utopian . I believe there are libraries present and to come for which it is entirely practicable . @# THE GROWING TENDENCY TO OVER-EMPHASIZE THE CHILDREN 'S SIDE @# An investigation of rural libraries in North Carolina and of library work with children in Boston and New England towns led Miss Caroline Matthews , a member of the Examining Committee of the Public Library of Boston to believe that " exaggerated leaning toward one phase of library work must throw out of the true the work as a whole . " The following paper explaining her conclusions was read before the Massachusetts Library Club in October , 1907 . Caroline Matthews was born in Boston in 1855 . She has contributed articles to the Educational Review and to the Atlantic Monthly . Miss Matthews is at present living in Switzerland . @# I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I have professional or technical knowledge of the subject to be discussed , but rather because I have not . This does not mean that I have no knowledge whatever of this or other phases of library work . It simply means that the little knowledge I do possess is non-professional , and that my impressions , points of view , conclusions , are wholly those of an outsider . Up to three years ago I had had no connection with public libraries beyond being an occasional borrower of books . Then suddenly , through making a comparative study of the financing of public school systems here and in France , I found myself in touch with the public schools of an American city , and through them with the school deposits of the Public Library of the same city . Even so , I did not come in touch with the library side of the work . It was always the school or teachers ' side , or the pupils ' side , never any other . The second year I became a member of the Examining Committee of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position on this committee for my first year of service was a minor one . There was never anything very important to do , certainly not enough to keep up one 's interest to the point of being a live interest . Moreover , I spent the winter away from town . But I had the great good fortune to pass it in the mountains of North Carolina . There I lived for weeks at a time in the homes and cabins of the mountain whites . I knew the men their wives , their children . I visited the logging camps , the mines , the missions , the mills , the schools . The life was rough , but it was worth while . It gave me an intimate knowledge of the social surroundings of the people , and I found the one vital problem , the problem touching the citizen the nearest , to be that of the rural school , and affiliated with the rural school , though affiliated in a crude way , was the library . Thus , for the second time in my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the school . This coincidence led me to think , and I reasoned out that library workers North and South must be working along similar lines toward unity in practice . Both were doing educative work . And both , apparently , had the same goal  --  the reaching of the parent or adult through the child or through child growth . How far such work was legitimate work , how far such work had intellectual or educational value , how far such work lacked or had balance , I now wished to determine . To do this it was necessary to assume some line of active investigation ; also to study results from the standpoint of the library , as well as from that of the school and the citizen . There was no need to search for a subject . I had it at hand . Living as I did with the people I found myself in the very center of the rural library movement  --  a movement so splendid in conception ; so successful in results , if statistics are credited ; so direct as to method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , books and bookcases ; so naively simple as to administration , there being neither librarians , libraries , or pay-rolls  --  that a study of it could not fail to prove helpful . What were the actual conditions ? First , the name " rural libraries " I found a misnomer . It in no sense represents facts . The words imply community interests , interests alike of adult and child , whilst the reality is that these libraries are simply school deposits , composed wholly of " juvenile books , " graded up to but not beyond the seventh grade . When one realizes that these books reach a total of 200,000 volumes , that they are sent to people living in scattered communities strung shoe-string fashion high along mountain ridges  --  back and apart from civilization  --  to a people of rugged character , demanding strength in books as in life , capable of appreciating strength , one sees what a stupendous opportunity for community uplift has been wasted , and one stands aghast at the folly , economic and intellectual , of the limitations imposed . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be considered why should they be fed nothing but " juvenile " literature ? It is both over-emphasis and false emphasis of the most harmful kind . Second , far and away the most interesting phase of this library work in North Carolina is that the whole movement lies outside of the hands of professionally trained librarians . To understand why this is so it is necessary to turn to the Department of Education . Education in North Carolina is a state affair and centralized , the state being for all practical purposes autocratic in every educational matter . Decentralization has set in to the extent of admitting local taxation ; otherwise education in North Carolina to-day is as highly centralized as it is in France . There is no difference whatever between the power of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction at Raleigh , and that of the Minister of Public Instruction in France . Such being the case it is but natural that the rural library movement should be absorbed by the state , incorporated into the Department of Education , and administered by the State Superintendent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change this . It would be wise , however , to appoint as one of the county superintendents of public instruction a trained librarian , having as his charge the entire supervision and administration of library interests . Third , all responsibility for the care of these libraries rests with teachers . The teachers should never have such responsibility . It is entirely beyond and outside of their proper work . I feel sure that this problem of how to care for school deposits of library books , a problem which is an issue North as it is South , is not so difficult of solution as library workers would have us believe . Disabuse yourselves of the notion that it is the teachers ' work , and a way out of the difficulty will be found . Fourth , not only is there a growing dissatisfaction with the library act as administered , but there is actually active opposition to it  --  on the part of some teachers , and on the part of certain public-spirited citizens . So much so is this a fact that a counter movement is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural libraries by private gift , by the citizens at large , and by certain societies . Tryon has such a library , a delightful building with two rooms and an ample supply of standard books ; Lenoir has one ; Boone has one . Yet these are small towns , two of them not exceeding 300 inhabitants each . An interesting feature of one of these libraries is that it serves largely as a social center for community life . Afternoon tea is served in it ; musicals held ; club papers read ; even the Woman 's Exchange meets and exhibits once a week . I had no means of discovering how general this movement was , nor yet of determining the ratio of emphasis laid on the social side of the work . But I want you to note one point  --  the movement starts with the adult and with standard works , and only by means of the adult , or through the parent , is the child reached . It is the exact antithesis of the state movement . Fifth , the libraries are neglected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where there were bookcases they were tucked aside in corner or entry , thick with dust , unused . The state statistics as to the growth of this movement ignore absolutely the facts I have mentioned . Therefore , I claim that in no true sense are these statistics representative . The movement , however , has interest . It is alive . It is sweeping through the state . It spends thousands of dollars a year . It concerns itself wholly with children . These are its characteristics . There can be no two opinions as to its lack of balance , for the adult is not even considered . There can be no two opinions as to its intellectual and educational values . Buying only " juvenile literature " they are of the smallest . There can be no two opinions as to its morality : the people are taxed , yet only a fraction of the people , only those who have children below the seventh and above the first grades , receive a return . How far North Carolina was seeking guidance of the North , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , the children 's side in library work , I next wished to determine . This brought me back to Boston , and to my second and final year of service on the Examining Committee . The chairmanship of the sub-committee on branches gave me opportunity for studying library work as it touched the child and the school in cities . This I supplemented by a less intensive study of library conditions in towns , in Massachusetts , Connecticut , New Hampshire , seeking to make my knowledge comprehensive . The first impression I received was that of the many interpretations put upon library work . These were almost as numerous as were the librarians and custodians . Viewing the work as a whole such divergence in practice seemed an error . There is power in unity ; results worth while follow . There is loss in the frittering away of time caused by casual experiment ; moreover , it bears heavily on the child . To this you may be inclined to answer that social and moral conditions vary so in each city and town that the individual condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extent you might wish . To illustrate : there is wisdom in allowing a certain station of the Boston system complete liberty of action . But the situation at this station is unique . It could not be duplicated even in Boston . The work is in the hands of a skilled leader , and it forms part of a large private work , financed by a philanthropist noted for leadership in wise experimentation . The library shows breadth in accepting the situation . But it is not wisdom to allow the introduction of the story hour , or , as is the case in a neighboring town , the throwing wide open of the children 's room to tots so tiny that picture blocks have to be furnished them to play with  --  before the educational authorities have pronounced such work necessary and just . I next noticed and with some alarm the feminization of the library corps . And I confess that I see no remedy . The schools are facing the same difficulty , but eventually it will be solved for them in the raising of certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to happen in library work . Consequently we have this feminization to reckon with , and to me it is an active factor in the diversity of library practice to which I have referred , for women far more than men are prone to indulge individual fads . A third impression was the lack of fitness of some library workers for their posts . This is particularly unfortunate when it occurs in a children 's room . Unless the person in charge possess the requisite qualifications , better far close the room . The fault lies perhaps with the colleges offering library courses . It may well be that the training in these should be more specialized than it is . Take the case of a student intending to pursue a given line of work  --  say children 's departments . Something definite should be offered her , something corresponding in worth to the graduate courses in practice and observation offered students of education in departments of education at universities . This is a practical suggestion ; it only requires on the part of colleges and libraries similar agreements to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phase of this question is that of libraries whose employees are not drawn from library schools or colleges , but who reach the several posts by a system of promotion based on efficiency and faithful service . Is there any reason why employees of such a system , specializing in children 's work should not serve an apprenticeship in the children 's department at central and be required to return to it again and again for further instruction ? As far as I know the heads of these children 's departments have no duties of this kind . But would not the value of a library corps be increased tenfold if they had ? They seize eagerly the opportunity to go out and instruct the teacher , to go out and instruct the parent . They have classes for the schools in the use of the library . But they neglect utterly the training of the library employee who is to serve as assistant first , as chief later , in the children 's room at branch or station . Yet the knowledge acquired by only one day of observation under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove invaluable to these women . Broaden the training given employees , and centralize experimentation . I found no TRUE affiliation with the schools . There was none in North Carolina ; there is none here . In countless ways the library and the school are overlapping . Why there should not be a clearer vision as to what is library work and what is school work is incomprehensible to an outsider . I grew to have a horror of children 's rooms  --  as distinct from children 's departments . Intellectually , physically , morally , I believe them harmful . Neither can I see their necessity . As regards classification of books , I received the impression that the broad division into " adult " and " juvenile " is too dogmatic , too arbitrary . Whatever other forms or divisions are necessary , this particular one should be abolished . It lowers the intellectual standing of the library with the community . The splendid character of library work in tenement districts stood out strongly . It is vigorous , alive , with an ever-broadening opportunity . More vivid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was that of the time and thought and care bestowed on the Child . Everywhere , in city , town and suburban library , the effort to reach the Child is apparent . Special attendants are in readiness to meet him the instant he comes into reading room and station after school hours . Thoughtful women are assigned to overlook and guide his reference work . Entertainment is offered him in the form of blocks to play with , scrap-books to look at , story hours to attend . Books specially selected with regard to his supposedly individual needs are placed on the shelves . Picture bulletins are made for his use in the schools . Where he is not segregated he is allowed to monopolize tables and chairs . I find no corresponding effort made to reach the adult , to reach the young mechanic , to draw to the library the parent . I at times wonder whether librarians and custodians are even aware that exaggerated leaning toward one phase of library work must throw out of the true the work as a whole . Nothing has astonished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the placing of the child in importance before the adult . The old belief that the library is primarily for adults and only incidentally for children still holds good at the central buildings of large city public library systems . In these we find the children 's department only one of many departments  --  the child always subordinate , the adult dominant  --  the result of a well balanced , admirable whole , each unit in its proper place , all forces pulling together . I fail to see why the same relative balance should not be maintained throughout the entire system , from branch to station , not always in kind and measure , but approximately . A second thought to which I can not adjust myself  --  is that of the parent as a factor in school and library work . The parent believes in the public school , and he pays heavily in taxes for the education of his children by means of it . The parent believes in the establishment of public libraries and he pays heavily in taxes for their equipment . Both sums raised are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , capable , efficient teachers and librarians . Such being the case does not the parent show intelligence in turning over to the public care the direction of his children 's education and reading ? Is he not justified in so doing ? Why then should he be held ignorant or selfish ? Eliminate the parent as a factor in library practice . Give the children quality in books . Strike off 50 per cent. , if you only will , of the titles to be found on the shelves of children 's rooms . Substitute " adult " books , and you will not need to appeal to the parent to guide the child 's choice . That there is similarity of practice in library work , in North Carolina and here , you can hardly deny . Point by point , in so far as the work relates to the child , the problems are mutual . Their solution lies in the getting together of school and library authorities , and the setting aside of the modern thought that library work is primarily educative and primarily for the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you can , let the adult once more dominate in library practice . You will then have a well-balanced whole , free from over-emphasis on the child 's side . @# LIBRARY WORK WITH CHILDREN @# A conception of the meaning and the possibilities of children 's work interpreted by means of present day social and industrial conditions is given by Henry E. Legler , librarian of the Chicago Public Library , in a paper on " Library work with children , " read at the Pasadena Conference of the A L. A. in 1911 . Henry Eduard Legler was born in Palermo , Italy , June 22 , 1861 . He was educated in Switzerland and the United States . In 1889 he was a member of the Wisconsin Assembly ; from 1890 to 1894 secretary of the Milwaukee School Board ; from 1904 to 1909 secretary of the Wisconsin Library Commission , and since 1909 has been librarian of the Chicago Public Library . In 1912-1913 Mr. Legler was President of the A. L. A. @# Not long since a man of genius took a lump of formless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew a great symbol of life . He called it Earthbound . An old man is bowed beneath the sorrow of the world . Under the weight of burdens that seemingly they can not escape , a younger man and his faithful mate stagger with bent forms . Between them is a little child . Instead of a body supple and straight and instinct with freedom and vigor , the child 's body yields to the weight of heredity and environment , whose crushing influence press the shoulders down . In this striking group the artist pictures for us the world-old story of conditions which meet the young lives of one generation , and are transmitted to the next . It is a picture that was true a thousand years ago ; it is a picture that is faithful of conditions today . Perhaps its modern guise might be more aptly and perhaps no less strikingly shown , as it recently appeared in the form of a cartoon illustrating Mrs. Elizabeth Barrett Browning 's verse : The Cry of the Children Do ye hear the children weeping , O my brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning their young heads against their mothers , And THAT can not stop their tears . The young lambs are bleating in the meadows , The young birds are chirping in the nest , The young fawns are playing with the shadows , The young flowers are blowing towards the west  - -  But the young , young children , O my brothers , They are weeping bitterly ! They are weeping in the playtime of the others , In the country of the free . Do you question the young children in the sorrow , Why their tears are falling so ? The old man may weep for his to-morrow Which is lost in long ago ; The old tree is leafless in the forest , The old year is ending in the frost , The old wound , if stricken , is the sorest , The old hope is hardest to be lost ; But the young , young children , O my brothers , Do you ask them why they stand Weeping sore before the bosoms of their mothers , In our happy Fatherland ? @# Go out , children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , children , as the little thrushes do . Pluck your handfuls of the meadow cowslips pretty , Laugh aloud to feel your fingers let them through ! @# Only in recent years has there grown into fulness a conception of what the duty of society is towards the child . For near two thousand years it was a world of grown-ups for grown-ups . Children there have been  --  many millions of them  --  but they were merely incidental to the scheme of things . Society regarded them not as an asset , except perhaps for purposes of selfish exploitation . If literature reflects contemporary life with fidelity , we may well marvel that for so many hundreds of years the boys and girls of their generation were so little regarded that they are rarely mentioned in song or story . When they are , we are afforded glimpses of a curious attitude of aloofness or of harshness . Nowhere do we meet the artlessness of childhood . In a footnote here , in a marginal gloss there , such references as appear point to torture and cruelty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christians , in the pagan ballads of the olden time , what there is of child life but illustrates the brutal selfishness of the elders . Certainly , no people understood as well as did the Jews that the child is the prophecy of the future , and that a nation is kept alive not by memory but by hope . Childhood to them was " the sign of fulfillment of glorious promises ; the burden of psalm and prophecy was of a golden age to come , not of one that was in the dim past . " So in the greatest of all books we come frequently upon phrases displaying this attitude : " There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem , and every man with his staff in his hand for very age . And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof . " " They shall remember me in far countries ; and they shall live with their children . " And most significant of all : " Suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centuries intervening , up to a hundred years ago , the men of pen and the men of brush give us a few touches now and then suggestive of childhood . However , they are observers rather than interpreters of childhood and its meaning . In the works of the great master painters , the dominant note is that of maternity , or the motive is devotional purely . Milton 's great ode on the Nativity bears no message other than this . In the graphic tale that Chaucer tells about Hugh of Lincoln , race hatred is the underlying sentiment , and the innocence of the unfortunate widow 's son appears merely to heighten the evil of his captors and not as typical of boyhood . Of the goodly company known collectively as the Elizabethan writers , silence as to the element of childhood is profound . In all the comedies and the tragedies of the greatest dramatist of all , children play but minor parts . In none of them save in King John , where historic necessity precludes the absence of the princes in the Tower , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the Merry Wives of Windsor , Mistress Anne Page 's son is briefly introduced , and is there made the vehicle for conversation which in this age might be regarded as gross suggestiveness . True , that is a rarely tender passage in the Winter 's Tale wherein Hermione speaks with her beloved boy , and the pathos of Arthur 's plea as he asks Hubert to spare his eyes is of course a masterpiece of literature ; these , however , the sum total of the great dramatist 's significant references to childhood . In the great works on canvas , save where the Christ-child is depicted , may be noted that same absence of the spirit of childhood . Wealthy and royal patrons , indeed , encouraged great artists to add favorite sons and daughters to the array of portraits in their family galleries . In time , the artists gave to the progeny of the nobility and the aristocracy generally , such creations as to them seemed appropriate to their years . These poses are but the caricature of childhood . Morland , Gainsborough , Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children of their wealthy patrons in attitudes which savor somewhat of burlesque , though it may have been intended quite seriously to hedge them about with spontaneity . It has been said that " a child 's life finds its chief expression in play , and that in play its social instincts are developed . " If this be true , we find in some contemporary canvases of this English school a curious reproduction of the favorite pastimes of children . One is called " bird-nesting , " the title descriptive of the favorite diversion thus depicted . Another bears the legend " Snow-balling , " and with no apparent disapproval save on the part of the little victims , shows a group of larger children ruthlessly snow-balling some smaller ones who have sought shelter in the portico of a church . Some distance down the street the form of an aged woman suggests another victim of youthful playfulness . A century and a half ago there was born , frail at first but with constant growth , a perception that the great moving forces of life contain elements hitherto disregarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and but a little later on , Froebel expounded his tenets . We need not be concerned as to the controversial disputation of rival schools of pedagogues whose claims for one ignore the merits of the other . A new thought came into being , and both Pestalozzi and Froebel contributed to its diffusion  --  whether in the form of Pestalozzi 's ideal , " I must do good to the child , " or Froebel 's , " I must do good through the child , " or perhaps a measurable merging of the two . Responsive to the note of life and thought around them , the great authors of prose and verse began to inject the new expression of feeling into what they wrote . Perhaps best reflected , as indeed it proved most potent in molding public opinion , this thought entered into the novels of Charles Dickens . These , in the development of child life as a social force , not only recorded history ; they made history , and the virile pencils of Leech and Phiz and Cruikshank aided what became a movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insight , there was laid bare the misery of childhood among the lowly and unfortunate , and the pathos of unhappy childhood was pictured with all its tragic consequences to society as a whole . In the story of Poor Joe , the street-crossing sweeper , who was always told to move on , we read the stories of thousands of the boys of to-day . His brief tenantry of Tom-all-Alones shows us the prototype of many thousands of living places in the slums of our own time . Conditions which environ growing boys and girls  --  not only thousands of men , but many millions  --  in the congested cities of the Anglo-Saxon world , are well suggested by the names which have been given in derision , or brutally descriptive as the case may be , to such centers of human hiving as the Houses of Blazes and Chicken-foot Alley , in Providence ; Hell 's Kitchen in New York ; the Bad Lands in Milwaukee ; Tin Can Alley , Bubbly Creek and Whiskey Row back of the stockyards in Chicago . In these regions and in others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ macaroni are drying ; broken pipes discharge sewage in the basement living quarters where the bananas are ripening ; darkness and filth dwell together in the tenement cellars where the garment-worker sews the buttons on for the sweat-shop taskmaster ; goats live amiably with human kids in the cob-webbed basements where little hands are twisting stems for flowers ; in the unlovely stable lofts where dwell a dozen persons in a place never intended for one ; in windowless attics of tall tenements where frail lives grow frailer day by day . Lisabetta , Marianna , Fiametta , Teresina , They are winding stems of roses , one by one , one by one  --  Little children who have never learned to play ; Teresina softly crying that her fingers ache today , Tiny Fiametta nodding when the twilight slips in , gray . High above the clattering street , ambulance and fire-gong beat ; They sit , curling crimson petals , one by one , one by one . Lisabetta , Marianna , Fiametta , Teresina , They have never seen a rosebush nor a dewdrop in the sun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Of a Black Hand and a Face behind a grating ; They will dream of cotton petals , endless , crimson , suffocating , Never of a wild rose thicket , nor the singing of a cricket ; But the ambulance will bellow through the wanness of their dreams , And their tired lids will flutter with the street 's hysteric screams Lisabetta , Marianna , Fiametta , Teresina , They are winding stems of roses , one by one , one by one ; Let them have a long , long playtime , Lord of Toil , when toil is done ; Fill their baby hands with roses , joyous roses of the sun . @# Reverting to Poor Tom , well may the words of Dickens in Bleak House serve as a text for to-day : " There is not an atom of Tom 's shrine , not a cubic inch of any pestilential gas in which he lives , nor an obscurity or degradation about him , nor an ignorance , nor a wickedness , nor a brutality of his committing , but shall work its retribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the proud and the highest of the high . " Whatever of permanence the ideal democracy which underlies our institutions may achieve , it will not be the survival of conditions such as these , but the fruition of their betterment . Recognition of the sinister elements involved determines the modern type of library work with children . That work rests upon a knowledge of the background which has been pictured , upon the use of methods that shall reach sanely and effectively the contributing causes , upon correlation of all the social forces that can be brought to bear unitedly . Recognition of conditions and causation gives power to , and justifies the modern trend of , library work with children as the most important and far-reaching of all its great work . Of thirty million men and women , and their children , who have come from Over-seas in two generations , 83 per cent were dwellers along the rim of the Mediterranean . Largely from that source have our towns grown overnight into swarming cities . Their children of to-day will be the men and women who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ignorance and greed , rather than necessity , breed the chief menace in our national life . Alone as a detached social force , the library can not hope to combat these , but in correlation with other forces may serve as one of the most potent agencies . In the children 's rooms and in kindred places , the missionaries of the book take the disregarded bits of life about them and weave them into a human element of power . The children 's rooms in the library and what they imply in the life of the people , are of such recent origin and growth that the complete force of their present-day work will not be fully apparent for a quarter century . What they hope to do , the instruments they purpose to use , are given succinctly in the pronouncement of one of our most progressive libraries OBJECTS OF LIBRARY WORK WITH CHILDREN To make good books available to all children of a community . To train boys and girls to use with discrimination the adult library . To reinforce and supplement the class work of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday " schools ) . To cooperate with institutions for civic and social betterment , such as playgrounds , settlements , missions , boys ' and girls ' clubs ; and with commercial institutions employing boys and girls , such as factories , postoffice special delivery division , telegraph and telephone agencies and department stores . And first and last to build character and develop literary taste through the medium of books and the influence of the children 's librarian . @# Pursuing these purposes , endeavoring to meet these tests . library work with children will make for better citizenship . It will take account not only of the children of the poor , but of the children of the well-to-do , who may need that influence even more . In the cities , which now overshadow our national life , there are no longer homes ; there are flats , where the boys and girls are tolerated  --  perhaps . " Our problem is not the bad boy , but rather the modern city , " says Prof. Allen Hoben . " The normal boy has come honestly by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gang instincts . It is when you take this healthy biological product and set him down in the midst of city restrictions that serious trouble ensues . For the city has been built for economic convenience , and with little thought for human welfare . Industrial aim is evidenced to every sense . You smell industrialism in the far-reaching odors of the stockyards . You hear it in the roar of the elevated hard by the windows of the poor . You see it in a water front that people can not use , and you touch it in the fleck of soot that is usually on your nose . The proof of industrial aggression ceases to be humorous , however , when it shows itself in the small living quarters of many a city flat where boys are supposed to find the equivalent of the old-time house . Constituted as he is , the boy can not but be a nuisance in the flat community . And because the flat dweller moves frequently , he will be without those real neighbors of long standing whose leniency formerly robbed the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters of his own where he may satisfy his sense of proprietorship and save up the numerous things he collects with a view to using them in construction . The flat dwellers will not permit the noise or litter incident to such building as a boy likes ; and he has little if any part in the labor of conducting the house . He loses dignity as a helpful and necessary member of the family , he loses that loyalty which attaches to the old familiar places of boyhood experience and strengthens many a man to-day , making him more kind and consistent in his living by virtue of homestead memories . " So the boy is driven to the street as his domain . It is his playground . And here he encounters the policeman . Of 717 children arrested in one month in New York City , more than half were arrested for playing games . Parenthetically , the fact may be quoted that in this children 's chief playground in a period of ten months 67 children were killed and 196 injured . Unerringly , these facts point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library and the children 's playground , a realization of that clear comprehension which the ancient Greeks had of the unity between the body and the mind . Quoting Plato : " If children are trained to submit to laws in their plays ' the love of law enters their souls with the music accompanying their games , never leaves them , and helps them in their development . " Having in thought physical recreation as a stimulus to mental development , in combination bringing home the joyousness of life , an ideal union of forces is being effected in some of the larger cities . In some places , the movement has assumed but an initial stage  --  a bit of tent shelter for distribution of books to children gathered at the sand pile . In some instances co-operation has joined the work of park breathing centers and library organizations . This has reached completed form in the placement of branch libraries as part of the park equipment , either quarters within a general building , or a separate little building adjacent to or on the athletic field . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rented store or memorial building of monumental type ; whether in the rooms of a school building or a corner in a factory ; whether by this method or by that , the children 's librarian employs the printed page to serve as instrument to these ends : The building of character , making for the best in citizenship . The enlargement of narrow lives , bringing the joy and savour and beauty of life to the individual . The opening of opportunity to all alike , which is the essence of democracy . And in , the doing , an incidental and a great contribution is made to society as a whole . For , as the story hour unfolds a new world to the listener whose life has been bounded by a litter- covered alley and three bare walls , or whose look into the outside world has been perhaps a roof of tar and gravel and a yawning chasm beyond , so the development of the imagination through the right sort of books shall make possible the fullest development of the individual boy and girl . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some circumstance , some stimulus has changed that life for good or ill . For want of that stimulus , the dormant power of many a man has gone to waste . Half the derelicts of humanity who are but outcasts of the night had in them the making of good men  --  perhaps some of them of great men , in science or in art . There is no waste that is greater than lost opportunity ; there is no loss so great as undiscovered resource . Speaking of imagination in work , Mr. Hamilton Wright Mabie points out that : " So long as the uses of the imagination in creative work are so little comprehended by the great majority of men , it can hardly be expected that its practical uses will be understood . There is a general if somewhat vague recognition of the force and beauty of its achievements as illustrated in the work of Dante , Raphael , Rembrandt and Wagner ; but very few people perceive the play of this supreme architectural and structural faculty in the great works of engineering , or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she comes to the end of the solid road of fact along which she has traveled . The scientist the engineer , the constructive man in every department of work uses the imagination quite as much as the artist ; for the imagination is not a decorator and embellisher , as so many appear to think ; it is a creator and constructor . Wherever work is done on great lines or life is lived in field of constant fertility , the imagination is always the central and shaping power . " I would have liked in this over-lengthy , but yet fragmentary survey of the field from the viewpoint of the library , to say something of the mistakes which have perhaps been made , and which may still be made unguardedly by reason of over-zeal whereby the relationship of the work to other things may be ignored or misunderstood ; of the danger that over-strong consciousness as to possession of high ideals may dictate too urgent use of books that may have literary style , but do not reach the heart of the boy  --  driving him to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading hours . These , and other comments must be left for another occasion . I would also have liked to say something of the history of work with children in libraries , but Miss Josephine Rathbone has told the story fully and well . In that history , when it shall be written a quarter century hence , it will be fitting to give full meed of honor to Samuel Sweet Greene , Edwin H. Anderson , Mrs. H. L. Elmendorf , Miss Frances J. Olcott , Miss Linda A. Eastman and some of the other splendid women of the profession whose presence here precludes the mention of their names . So , too , I would have liked to give the result , statistically , of an inquiry , which the helpful kindness of Miss Faith E. Smith , chairman of this section , has enabled me to make . It must suffice here to limit the statement to a brief summary that shows less what has been accomplished than what remains to be attempted : There are in the United States to-day approximately 1,500 public libraries containing each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work is 525 , with a total of 676 rooms having an aggregate seating capacity of 21,821 , and an available combined supply of 1,771,161 volumes on open shelves . The number of libraries in which story hours are held is 152 , and 304 report work with schools . Of course , this work is pitifully meager as to many libraries . The number of children who come more or less under the direct influence of children 's librarians is generously estimated as 1,035,195 ( 103 libraries , including all the large systems reporting ) . There are in the United States of children from 6 to 16 years of age , approximately thirty-three millions . Behind the work of the children 's librarians there is a fine spirit of optimism  --  not blind to difficulties , but courageous , ardent and hopeful . Disregarding ridicule , which is but a cheap substitute for wit ; regardful of criticism , which is often provocative or promotive of improvement , inspired with the dignity of their high calling , and with a fine vision that projects itself into the future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereto the finest and the best of personality that they possess . Descriptive of their spirit , we may aptly paraphrase the words of a great humanitarian of our own generation : " Some there are , the builders of humanity 's temples , who are laboring to give a vast heritage to the children of all the world . They build patiently , for they have faith in their work . " And this is their faith  --  that the power of the world springs from the common labor and strife and conquest of the countless age of human life and struggle ; that not for a few was that labor and that struggle , but for all . And the common labor of the race for the common good and the common joy will bring that fulness of life which sordid greed and blighting ignorance would make impossible . " And you have the faith of the builders . @# VALUES IN LIBRARY WORK WITH CHILDREN @# The function of library work with children as a factor in community life is further shown in the following articles . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recognition that the chief aim in education is character building ; the necessity of the careful selection of books for all classes of children ; the understanding of the personal relationship of the child to the library ; the development of a sense of ownership on the part of the child ; the possibility of being a factor in the assimilation of the foreign element of the population ; and the realization that all are workers in a common cause , thus bringing encouragement and inspiration . @# LIBRARY MEMBERSHIP AS A CIVIC FORCE @# One of the sessions of the Children 's librarians section of the A. L. A. meeting at Minnetonka in 1908 was given up to the discussion of the place of children 's library work in the community . The library point of view was presented by Miss Moore . Annie Carroll Moore was born in Limerick , Maine , and was graduated from Limerick Academy in 1889 and Bradford Academy in 1891 . After completing her work in the Pratt Institute Library School in 1896 she became children 's librarian in the Pratt Free Library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children 's department in the New York Public Library , of which she is still supervisor . Miss Moore has lectured on library work with children and has contributed many articles on the subject to library periodicals . @# Fifteen years ago the Minneapolis public library opened a children 's room from which books were circulated . Previous to 1893 a reading room for children was opened in the Brookline ( Mass. ) public library but the Minneapolis public library was the first to recognize the importance of work with children by setting aside a room for their use with open shelf privileges and with a special assistant in charge of it . Since 1893 children 's rooms and children 's departments have sprung up like mushrooms , all over the country , and first in Pittsburg , then in Brooklyn , Cleveland , Philadelphia , New York City and Queens Borough , children 's rooms in branch libraries have been organized into departments from which a third , at least , of the entire circulation of the libraries is carried on by assistants , either trained or in training to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompaniment of such rapid growth that the work should suffer growing pains in the form of criticism and even caricature at the hands of casual observers and clever writers . Those of us who have been identified with the movement since its inception have somehow managed to preserve our faith in a survival of the fittest by remembering that there was a time when everything was new , and have felt that if we could keep a firm grip on the active principles which inspire all successful work with children , whether it is the work of a small independent library or that of a large system of libraries , our labor was not likely to be lost . The children , the books and ourselves are the three elements to be combined and the success of the combination does not depend upon time , nor place , nor circumstance . It depends upon whether we have a clear vision of our surroundings and are able to adapt ourselves to them , a growing appreciation of the value of books to the persons who read them , and the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . If we can do all these things for a period of years we have little need to worry about the future success of the work . The boys and girls will look after that . In many instances they have already begun to look after it and the best assurance for the future maintenance of free libraries in America rests with those who , having tried them and liked them during the most impressionable years of their lives , believe in the value of them for others as well as for themselves to the extent of being ready and willing to support them . In passing from a long and intimate experience in the active work of a children 's room in an independent library to the guidance of work in the children 's rooms of a system of branch libraries , a great deal of thought has been given to deepening the sense of responsibility for library membership by regarding every form of daily work as a contributory means to this end . The term " library membership " is a survival of the old subscription library but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrower " or " user " and broadens rather than restricts the activities of a free library by making it seem more desirable to " belong to the library " than to " take out books . " It is the purpose of this paper to present in outline for discussion such aspects of the work as may help to substantiate the claim of its ambitious and perhaps ambigious title : Library Membership as a Civic Force . 1 . Our first and chief concern is with the selection of books and right here we are confronted by so many problems that we might profitably spend the entire week discussing them . In general , the selection of books for a children 's room which is seeking to make and to sustain a place in the life of a community should offer sufficient variety to meet the needs and desires of boys and girls from the picture book age to that experience of life which is not always measured by years nor by school grade but is tipified by a Jewish girl under 14 years old , who , on being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm , " said to the librarian , " It 's not the kind of book you would enjoy yourself , is it ? " , and on being answered in the affirmative , tactfully stated her own point of view : " Well , you see it is just this way , children have their little troubles and grown people have their great troubles . I guess it 's the great troubles that interest me . " We have been quick to recognize the claim of the foreign boy or girl who is learning our language and studying our history but we are only just beginning to recognize the claims of those , who , having acquired the language , are seeking in books that which they are experiencing in their own natures . Human nature may be the same the world over , but there is a vast difference in its manifestations between the ages of ten and sixteen in a New England village or town and in a foreign neighborhood of one of our large cities . The selection of adult books in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and literature is too limited in the children 's rooms of many libraries and should be enlarged to the point of making the shelves of classed books look more like those of a library and less like those of a school room . Titles in adult fiction should include as much of Jane Austen as girls will read and an introduction to Barrie in " Peter Pan " and the " Little Minister . " " Jane Eyre " will supply the demand for melodrama in its best form , while " Villette , " and possibly " Shirley , " may carry some girls far enough with Charlotte Bronte to incline them to read her life by Mrs. Gaskell . William Black 's " Princess of Thule " and " Judith Shakespeare " will find occasional readers . " Lorna Doone " will be more popular , although there are girls who find it very tedious . There should be a full set of Dickens in an edition attractive to boys and girls . A complete set of the Waverly novels in a new large print edition , well paragraphed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sufficient variation in the bindings to present an inviting appearance on the shelves would lead , I believe , to a very much more general reading of Scott .

In general , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard novels in order that the boys and girls who go out from the children 's room may know what good novels are and so much of modern fiction as shall serve to give the collection the appearance of being interesting and up to date without lowering the standard of that taste for good reading which is the chief purpose in shelving such a collection in a children 's room . The presence of the books is good for the children 's librarian as well as for the children and it goes without saying that she must be familiar with them if she is to use them intelligently . The point to stop in the purchase of books designed for supplementary reading is with the smallest number that will meet the active demands which are not met by REAL books . We may well stop with the third book in most cases of purchase of books in sets . Does anybody know whether informational readers on the shelves of a children 's room leads to genuine interest in the subject so presented ? To quote one boy 's opinion of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most disinteresting subject there is . " The cheapness of these publications has led to a larger duplication of them in libraries than seems desirable for the best interests of the work . We need in place of them such books , with certain modifications in treatment , as were indicated by Dr. Stanley Hall in his recent and very suggestive address on Reading as a factor in the education of children ( Library Journal , April , 1908 ) . Most of all do we need a series of books which will put foreign children and their parents in touch and in sympathy with the countries from which they came by spirited illustrations in color of street scenes , festivals and scenes from home life accompanied by simple direct statements and with translations of such stories and poems as may aid in making and keeping the impressions of their country vivid and lasting . There has been a rising wave of production of primers and first reading books during the past five years . Some libraries have experienced a primer craze and it becomes exceedingly difficult to decide which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Primers and " easy books " have a use for children who are learning to read but too free a use of them may be one of the influences responsible for that lack of power of sustained attention and limitation in vocabulary which is frequently shown by boys and girls from twelve to fourteen years old . The edition in which a book for children appears is a matter of very much greater importance than is realized by those who view the work from a distance . It is not purely an aesthetic consideration . It has a very practical bearing on whether the book will be read or not and libraries which have the least money to spend should be most careful to spend it for books in editions which are attractive to children . 2 . The only thoroughly successful means of securing respect and good care of library books is for libraries to maintain higher standards of excellence in respect to intelligent repairing and binding , to discard promptly a book which is to any extent mutilated or which is so soiled as to make it seem unwarrantable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The books on the circulating shelves should be the most attractive part of a children 's room . That it is possible to make and to keep them so is not a theory but a demonstrable fact . Three years ago a branch library was opened in one of the poor districts of a large city . The usual problems in the discipline of individuals and of gangs were present . Many of the new books were soiled , others were mutilated and several were missing at inventory taking . The librarian believed the moral lesson conveyed to children by training them to take care of library books to be one of the first requirements of good citizenship . She determined that no boy or girl should be able to say : " I took it that way " , in returning a soiled or mutilated book . In order to carry out her ideas to a successful issue it has been necessary for her to inspire her entire staff with a sense of the value of such training and to impress upon them that careful handling of books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care on the part of the children . Every book is examined at the time it is returned and before it is placed on the shelves it is given such repair as it may need . By careful washing , skillful varnishing and by the use of a preparation for removing grease spots many books are given an extended turn of service without lowering the standards established . Paper covers are provided as wrappers on rainy days and on sticky days . Such care of books requires time and sustained interest but I believe that it pays in the immediate as well as in the future results , when grown into men and women , the boys and girls who were taught this first lesson in citizenship will look back upon it with feelings of respect and satisfaction . The cost to the library is less in expenditure for books and for service . The library mentioned affords direct evidence that loss of books by theft is very largely controlled by such simple means provided the means are consciously and consistently related to the larger end of regarding the property rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its membership has been sustained during the three years . 3 . In dealing with large numbers of children of foreign parentage it is evident that we need to define their relationship to the library more clearly than we have done as yet . Quite frequently they do not distinguish between the building and the books and refer to the latter as " taking libraries " . Now " taking a library " home is a very different matter from playing a part in the life of a civic institution and the parents as well as the boys and girls are quick to feel a difference which they are not always able to express in words . Quite early in my experience this was brought home to me by a visit from the mother of a Jewish boy who had been coming to the children 's room for about a year . She came on a busy Saturday afternoon and after looking about the room seated herself near the desk while the boy selected his books . As Leopold always tested the interest of several books before committing himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were ready to go she explained why she had come . She had been curious to discover for herself , she said , what it was Leopold got from the Library that made him so much easier to get on with at home . He had grown more thoughtful of his younger brothers and sisters , more careful of his books and other belongings and more considerate of his mother . " I would n't have him know the difference I see , " she continued , " but he told me you were always asking him to bring me here and I made up my mind to come and see for myself and I have . " These children are learning how to BEHAVE in PUBLIC as well as how to choose good books and I think it comes from the feeling they have of belonging to the Library , and being treated in the way they like , whether they are as young as my Simon , who is six years old , or as old as Leopold , who will be fourteen next month . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same as it is at school ; but having the younger ones here makes it more as it is at home . " Should it not be the plan and purpose of a children 's room to make every boy and girl feel at home there from the moment of signing an application blank ? Forms of application blanks and the manner of registration differ in nearly every library . Whatever form is used , personal explanation is always essential and it does not seem worth while to advocate a simplified form for the use of children . I believe there are very decided advantages in a system of registration which requires the children to write their own names in a book . The impression made upon their memories is distinctly different and more binding than that made by writing the name on a slip of paper and has frequently been of great service in cases of discipline as the signature is headed by a reminder of obligations : " When I write my name in this book I promise to take good care of all the books I read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obey the rules of the Library . " Such a method of registration is not impractical , even in a large library provided the work is carefully planned to admit of it . Recent inquiries and investigation show very convincingly that a large proportion of parents , both foreign born and American , and a considerable number of educators , social workers and persons connected with libraries in England and in this country , have exceedingly hazy ideas respecting the work public libraries are doing for children . The issue of an admirable illustrated hand book on " The Work of the Cleveland public library with children " and the means used to reach them , should make clear to the latter whatever has seemed vague or indefinite in the work . But there are many parents in large cities and in manufacturing towns , who can not be induced to visit libraries and see for themselves as Leopold 's mother did , and they are frequently averse to having their children go to a place they know nothing about , believing that they are being drawn away from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How is it possible to stimulate their curiosity and interest to the point of making a Library seem desirable and even necessary in the education of their children to become citizens and wage earners ? Printed explanations and rules issued by libraries are either not read or not understood by the majority of persons to whom they are addressed . There is something very deadening to the person of average intelligence about most printed explanations of library work . Pictures which bring the work before people from the human side might be more successful and I wish to submit an outline for a pictorial folder designed to accompany an application blank to the home of an Italian child . @# DESCRIPTION OF FOLDER In size it is five inches long and three inches wide . On the outer cover appears a picture of the exterior of the library , underneath the picture the name of the library , its location and the hours it is open . On the first page a picture of the children 's room with this inscription underneath : Boys and Girls come here to read and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little children . On the second page a picture of the adult department , showing its use and giving the information all foreigners seem desirous to have : Men and Women come here to read and to study . Books on the Laws and Customs of America . Books , Papers and Magazines in Italian and other foreign languages . Books from which to learn to read English . On the back of the cover these simple directions : @# HOW TO JOIN THE LIBRARY The use of the Library is Free to anyone who comes to Read or to Study in its rooms . If you wish to take Books home you must sign an application blank and give the name and address of some one who knows you . The information on the folder should be given in the language or languages of the neighborhood in which the library is situated . This folder was designed for a branch library in an Italian neighborhood but a similar folder might be utilized in any community provided the information is given in simple , direct form and the pictures show the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library is not all . However carefully and impressively the connection is made we are all conscious of those files of cards " left by borrower , " which indicate that a connection must be sustained if library membership is to prove its claim as a civic force . There are those who regard a restriction of circulation to one or two story books a week as a desirable means to this end , believing that interest in reading is heightened by such limitation . That many boys and girls read too much we all know , but I am inclined to think that whatever restriction is made should be made for the individual rather than laid down as a library rule . Other libraries advocate a remission of fines , at the same time imposing a deprivation in time of such length that it would seem to defeat the chief end of the children 's room which is to encourage the reading habit . Children who leave their cards for six months at a time are not likely to be very actively interested in their library . There seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Children should be required to pay their fines as a lesson in civic righteousness . Persons holding this view would allow the working out of fines under some circumstances but regard the fine as a debt . 2 . Any system of fines is a wrong one , therefore all fines should be remitted and some other punishment for negligence substituted . Persons holding this view would deprive children of the use of the library for a stated period . 3 . A fine is regarded as slightly punitive and probably the most effective means of teaching children to respect the rights of others in their time use of books . Persons holding this view would reduce the fine to one cent , wherever a fine is exacted and would exercise a great deal of latitude in dealing with individual cases , remitting or cutting down fines whenever it seems wise to do so and imposing brief and variable time deprivations of the use of the library rather than a long fixed period . Whatever viewpoint is taken it will be necessary to remind children constantly that by keeping their books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading of them . One of the most effective means of sustaining and promoting such a sense of library membership as I have indicated is the extension of reading-room work by placing on open , or on closed shelves , if necessary , a collection of the best children 's books in the best editions obtainable , to be used as reading-room books . Children may be so trained in the careful handling of these books as to become very much more careful of their treatment of the book they take home and the experiment is not a matter of large expense to the library . The reading-room books should never be allowed to become unsightly in appearance if they are to do their full work in the room as an added attraction to the children and as suggestive to parents , teachers and other visitors who may wish to purchase books as gifts . The value of a well conducted Story hour or Reading club as a means of sustaining the library connection and of influencing the spontaneous choice of books by boys and girls has not been fully recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various methods of conducting Story hours and Reading clubs . There are many differences of opinion as to whether the groups should be large or small , differentiated by age or by sex , whether the groups should be made up entirely of children or whether an occasional adult may be admitted without changing the relation between the story teller and the children . Those who desire suggestion of material and specific information as to method and practice will find much that is valuable and practical in the publication of the Carnegie library of Pittsburg and in the Handbook of the Cleveland public library . Those who are seeking to place a Story hour in work already established will do well to remember that it is a distinctly social institution and as such is bound to be colored by the personality of its originator whether she tells the stories herself or finds others to carry out her ideas . Make your Story hour the simple and natural expression of the best you have to give and do not attempt more than you can perform . I believe the Story hour is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of parents and of stirring that active recollection of their own childhood which leads to sharing its experiences with their children . Folk tales told in the language his father and mother speak should give to the child of foreign parentage a feeling of pride in the beautiful things of the country his parents have left in place of the sense of shame with which he too often regards it . The possibilities in this field are unlimited if wisely directed . The value of exhibits depends upon the subject chosen and the exercise of imagination , good taste and practical knowledge of children 's tastes in selecting and arranging the objects or pictures . The subject must be one which makes an immediate appeal to the passing visitor . There should not be too much of it and it should not be allowed to remain too long in the room . A single striking object is often more effective than a collection of objects . Some interpretation of an exhibit in the form of explanation or story is needed if the children are to become very much interested in reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , Clubs , Exhibits , and Picture bulletins are not " legitimate library work , " I would say , suspend your judgment until you have watched or studied the visible effects of such work in a place where it is properly related to the other activities of the library and to the needs of the community in which it is situated . If by the presence of an Arctic exhibit in an Italian and Irish-American non-reading neighborhood an interest is stimulated which results in the circulation and the reading of several hundred books on the subject during the time of the exhibition and for months afterward , the exhibit certainly seems legitimate . 5 . Since it is true that social conditions , racial characteristics and individuality in temperament enter very actively into the problems of the care of children in libraries and since it is also true that the books children read and the care which is given to them in libraries are frequently reflected in their conduct in relation to the School , the Church , the Social settlement , the Playground , the Juvenile court and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more enlightened conception of the work of all these institutions is essential if the Children 's library is to play its full part in the absorption of children of different nations into a larger national life . This need is being recognized and partially met by lecture courses and by the practice work of students in library training schools but listening to lectures , reading , and regulated student practice does not take the place of that spontaneous eagerness to see for one 's self , the social activities of a neighborhood or town which makes a library in its town a place of living interest . Librarians , en masse , in relation to other institutions , stand in a similar position to that of the representative of those institutions . On both sides a firsthand knowledge of the aims and objects and methods of work of all the forces at work in a given community and a perception of their interrelationship is essential if we wish to do away with the present tendency to duplicate work which is already being carried on by more effective agencies . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of other institutions it is impossible to prescribe . The aim should be to make its own work so clear to the community in which it is placed that it will command the respect and the support of every citizen . @# THE CIVIC VALUE OF LIBRARY WORK WITH CHILDREN @# The second paper at the Minnetonka sectional meeting , mentioned in the introduction to the preceding article , was presented by Dr. Graham Taylor , Director of the Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy , who believes that " equally with the schools and playgrounds , our library centers are essential to American democracy . " Dr. Taylor was born in Schenectady , N. Y. , in 1851 ; received the degree of A.B . from Rutgers College in 1870 , and was graduated from the Reformed Theological Seminary , New Brunswick , N. J. , in 1873 . He has since been granted the honorary degrees of D.D . and LL.D . From 1873 to 1892 he remained in the pastorale ; from 1888 to 1892 was Professor of Practical Theology in Hartford Theological Seminary , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seminary . In 1894 he became the founder and resident warden of the Chicago Commons Social Settlement . Dr. Taylor is associate editor of the Survey . @# The child is coming to be as much of a civic problem as it ever has been a family problem . Upon the normality of its children the strength and perpetuity of the state depend , as surely as the dependency and delinquency of its children undermine the prowess and menace the life of the state . The education and discipline , labor and recreation of the child figure larger all the while in our legislation and taxes , our thinking and literature . Democracy , machine industry , immigration and child psychology combine to make the child a new problem to the modern state and city , especially in America . With the problems of the child 's normality and defectiveness , discipline and delinquency , work and play , and its assimilation into the body politic , our towns and cities , states and nation have been forced to deal . Hitherto we have dealt far more with the negative and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , purpose and method respecting them . We have , for instance , paid more attention to defective children than to the prenatal antecedents and early conditions of child life . We have been too long punishing juvenile delinquency without trying to help the backward and wayward child . We have let young children work without regard to the industrial efficiency of their whole life . We are only beginning to share the attention we have paid to the education of our children with the equally serious problem of their recreation . We have been content merely with their physical exercise and have been stupidly obtuse to awaking and satisfying the pleasurable interest of the child in his play and the organization of it . Where there have been an un-American fear of immigration and feeling against the immigrant there has been all too little effort put forth to assimilate the foreign elements of our local population . But we are coming to see that to prepossess is better than to dispossess . Prevention is found to be a surer and cheaper solvent of our child problems than punishment . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove to be greater than all the repressive measures to obtain and maintain our control over him . Thus our very disciplinary measures have become saner and more effective . No way-mark of our civilization registers greater progress than our abandonment of the criminal procedure against children and our adoption of the paternal spirit and method of our juvenile courts and reformatory measures . To our agencies for dealing with defectives and delinquents we have added the kindergarten and all the kindred principles , methods and instrumentalities of constructive work with children . Chief among these is the use we are making of the child 's instinct for play and mental diversion as a means of building up both the individual and the social life . Chicago has made the discovery of the civic value of recreation centers for the play of the people . Not since old Rome 's circus maximus and the Olympic games of Greece has any city made such provision for the recreation of its people as is to be found in these great playfields , surrounding the beautifully designed and well equipped field houses , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money have been built in the most crowded districts of Chicago . The recreation centers illustrate the civic opportunity and value of library work with children . For the Chicago public library was quick to see and seize the advantage thus offered to serve the city . The delivery stations and reading rooms established in these field houses are already recognized to be the most useful of its centers to the child life of the city . The organized volunteer cooperation of several groups of women has added the story hour as a regular feature of the library work at these playgrounds , and at two public school buildings where similar stations are to be established in cooperation with the Board of education . At the central library building the work in the Thomas Hughes Young people 's reading room has also been successfully supplemented by the story hour appointments in a large hall , with the same efficient cooperation . The quick and large response given by the people to these civic extensions of library service in every city and town where they have been offered , demonstrates what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the experiment has gone far enough to prove the absolute necessity of having librarians especially trained for work with children ; and to that end , the addition of the position of children 's librarian to the classified civil service lists for which special examinations are set . Equally with the schools and playgrounds , our library centers are essential to American democracy . All three are to be classed together as our most democratic and efficient agencies for training our people into their citizenship and assimilating them into the American body politic . Nowhere are we on a more common footing of an equality of opportunity than in the public schools , the public playground and the public library . The public school stands upon that bit of mother earth which belongs equally to us all . The playground is open alike to all comers . And the public library is not only as free and open to all as to any of our whole people , but also confers citizenship in that time-long , world wide democracy of the Republic of Letters . The civic service thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indispensably valuable . It may be made more and more invaluable to any community by intelligent insight into the needs of the people , and by the practical and prompt application of library resources which are limited only by our capacity , enterprise and energy to develop and apply them . @# ESTABLISHING RELATIONS BETWEEN THE CHILDREN 'S LIBRARY AND OTHER CIVIC AGENCIES @# A broader idea of library work with children necessitates greater knowledge of other agencies which work with them and a spirit of willing cooperation on the part of the children 's librarian . From her experience in the city of Washington Miss Herbert contributed the following article of The Library Journal . Clara Wells Herbert was born in Stockbridge , Mass. ; was a student in Vassar from 1894 to 1896 ; received a special certificate from the Training School for Children 's Librarians in 1904 ; was children 's librarian in the Brooklyn Public Library from 1904 to 1907 , and since that time has been the head of the Children 's department in the Public Library of the District of Columbia . @# The children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine aggressive work and through branch children 's rooms , close work with schools , including deposits of books in classrooms , deposits of books and story-telling in playgrounds , home libraries and home visiting , are coming close to the children and putting good books within their reach . Such work rests upon a large staff and a generous appropriation . On the other hand , the small town library has the advantage of informal relations with its people and is a part of the various activities of the town . Between these two types of libraries is a third . It is located in a city too large for the helpful informal relations of the town library . It can not , on the other hand , carry on its own aggressive work , for it is hampered by the smallness of its staff and the meagerness of its appropriation . To libraries of this sort the effecting of cordial relations with other civic institutions is of the utmost importance . Upon it depends largely the outside work of the library and a specialized knowledge of conditions very essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to profit by cooperation . " I never thought of asking for help there , " said a probation officer recently when talking of her difficulties in keeping a record of the use of the withdrawn books given to the court by the library . Not more than we need the benefit of the intimate personal knowledge of conditions of such workers , do they often need the help the library stands ready and eager to give but which they do not think to ask . The work of the children 's department should be then twofold in purpose  --  to reach the children directly as far as possible , and to establish such relations with other organizations as will render it a vital interested force in the community , a place where people will naturally turn for help along the line of its work . Certain practices which have been found useful in effecting this cooperation may be suggestive , but the basis of any satisfactory relationship is interest and the desire to help and has its beginnings in the children 's room . The children 's librarian should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers who , strong in the belief that the hope of the future is in the children , are doing devoted work in their behalf . Sooner or later they will visit the children 's room and the opportunity presents itself to know their particular line of work . It is interesting to note in how many of such cases the conversation contains something which may be applied with advantage to the library 's activities . At least , the visitor receives the impression that the library assistant is interested in any work done for children and , if at some future time a need presents itself , turns to her for assistance . This interest is also shown if the children 's librarians attend meetings or conferences held in behalf of children or from which they may gather information on home conditions . Frequently there are courses of lectures given by charity organizations or club meetings of sociological workers where the problems of the city are discussed . Libraries having staff or apprentice meetings frequently invite as speakers persons representing some particular phase of work , and these occasions engender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their staffs former kindergartners and charity workers that they might profit by their special training and the knowledge of conditions gathered from their former experiences . Much may be said of the undesirability of distributing withdrawn books among institutions . But in libraries where the maintenance of travelling collections is limited they afford perhaps the only opportunity of reaching the children in orphanages , reform schools and similar institutions . Such distributions should be followed by visits to the institutions to talk , if possible , to the children and to get an idea of their needs and tastes . Collections of withdrawn books at the juvenile court are used by the children while on probation and often after release , and by the grown people of their families as well . In Cleveland the list of official parents and paroled boys is furnished the library and booklists and information about the nearest branch are sent them . In Washington the library supplies the probation officers with application blanks . When a child who has shown a taste for reading is to be discharged the officer on the last visit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's signature . The child brings the application to the library , obtains cards immediately and is helped in his selection of books . The attendance or truant officers of the schools know home conditions better than teachers . They have a general knowledge of the city and the peculiarities of the different sections that is most helpful in the selection of places for home libraries or deposit stations . Their knowledge of the home life of troublesome children will often throw light on difficult cases of discipline . In Washington the attendance officer issues permits under the child labor law . From this office may be secured a list of stores and other places of employment for children . The library should send notices to such buildings and place at the office invitations to use the library to be distributed at the time the permits for work are issued . The Cleveland Public Library uses for a mailing list for publications pertaining to children 's work a card directory of social workers . This directory gives the name , address and connection of each individual and includes board members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pastors and their assistants , of churches conducting club work , and others similarly engaged . In some cities this same information may be gathered from the published directory of philanthropic agencies and their reports . Lists such as those published by the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh , " Stories to tell to children , " " Books for reading circles , " " Games , " or lists made especially in connection with the activities of a settlement , playground , etc. , mailed to its club workers attract them to the library . Rainy days when the hours drag and the children can not be out of doors are good times to visit summer camps and vacation homes . There may be an opportunity to tell stories or for a talk to the children which , when their vacation is over , they are glad to remember . There are two special collections which it is well for the children 's department to have  --  one for the children and one for grown people . It should follow Newark 's notable example in putting into form , adapted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , its institutions , historic spots , etc . The collection of such material informs the assistants , attracts the cooperation of those from whom the information is sought and by acquainting the child with the manifold features of the life of the city , helps to prepare him for intelligent citizenship . It should collect , also , all material relative to the children of the city . It should have reports of settlements , institutions , summer camps and homes , day nurseries , work with foreigners , mounted maps of the location of schools and playgrounds , copies of the child labor law , compulsory education act , in fact , any information obtainable about the conditions of the child life of the city . Such material will draw interested people to the library and thus open up opportunities for further cooperation . Such are a few of the many ways in which the children 's room may be tied to other organizations working for children . Under the varied conditions of different cities they develop indefinitely . Only a few could be mentioned here . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is generally established , has not been included . As these relations grow closer and closer the library 's work broadens and deepens and the realization that all are workers in a common cause brings encouragement and inspiration for the daily task . @# VALUES IN LIBRARY WORK WITH CHILDREN @# The " possibility and duty , " on the part of the children 's library , of being a moral force in the community , was discussed by Clara W. Hunt in a paper presented at the Narragansett Pier Conference of the A. L. A. in 1906 . Seven years later , at the Kaaterskill Conference in 1913 , Miss Hunt again considered the influence of children 's libraries as a civic force . This later paper , representing more fully her point of view , and embodying her later experience , is here reprinted . Clara Whitehill Hunt was born in Utica , N. Y. , in 1871 . She was graduated from the Utica Free Academy in 1889 , and from the New York State Library School in 1898 . From 1893 to 1896 she was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children in the Apprentices ' Library , Philadelphia , in 1898 , and had charge of it in the Newark , N. J. , Free Public Library from 1898 to 1902 . Since 1903 she has been Superintendent of the Children 's Department of the Brooklyn Public Library . Miss Hunt has been a lecturer and contributor to magazines on children 's literature , library work with children and related topics , and has published a book on " What shall we read to the children ? " You are probably familiar with the story of the man who , being asked by his host which part of the chicken he liked best replied that " he 'd never had a chance to find out ; that when he was a boy it was the fashion to give the grown people first choice , and by the time he 'd grown up the children had the pick , so he 'd never tasted anything but the drumstick . " It will doubtless be looked upon as heresy for a children 's librarian to own that she has a deal of sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been moments when she has even gone so far as to say an " amen "  --  under her breath  --  to the librarian who , after a day of vexations at the hands of the exasperating young person represented in our current social writings as a much-sinned-against innocent , wrathfully exploded , " Children ought to be put in a barrel and fed through the bung till they are twenty-one years old ! " During the scant quarter century which has seen the birth and marvelous growth of modern library work with children , the " new education " has been putting its stamp upon the youth of America and upon the ideas of their parents regarding the upbringing of children . And it has come to pass that one must be very bold to venture to brush off the dust of disuse from certain old saws and educational truisms , such as " All play and no work make Jack a mere toy , " " No gains without pains , " " We learn to do by doing , " " Train up a child in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our kindergartens , our playground agitators , our juvenile courts , our child welfare exhibits are so persistently  --  and rightly  --  showing the wrongdoing child as the helpless victim of heredity and environment that hasty thinkers are jumping to the conclusion that , since a child is not to blame for his thieving tendencies , it is our duty , rather than punish , to let him go on stealing ; since it is a natural instinct for a boy to like the sound of crashing glass and the exercise of skill needed to hit a mark , we must not reprove him for throwing stones at windows ; because a child does not like to work , we should let him play  --  play all the time . The painless methods of the new education , which tend to make life too soft for children , and to lead parents to believe that everything a child craves he must have , these tendencies have had their effect upon the production and distribution of juvenile books , and have added to the librarian 's task the necessity not only of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate lest it crowd out the best . It is the importance of this latter warfare which I wish mainly to discuss . We children 's librarians , in the past fifteen or twenty years , have had to take a good many knocks , more or less facetious , from spectators of the sterner sex who are worried about the " feminization of the library , " and who declare that no woman , certainly no spinster , can possibly understand the nature of the boy . Perhaps sometimes we are inclined to droop apologetic heads , because we know that some women are sentimental , that they do n't all " look at things in the large , " as men invariably do . In view , however , of the record of this youthful movement of ours , we have a right rather to swagger than to apologize . The influence of the children 's libraries upon the ideals , the tastes , the occupations , the amusements , the language , the manners , the home standards , the choice of careers , upon the whole life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and girls has been beyond all count as a civic force in America . And yet , while teachers tell us that the opening of every new library witnesses a substitution of wholesome books for " yellow " novels in pupils ' hands ; while men in their prime remark their infrequent sight of the sensational periodicals left on every doorstep twenty years ago ; while publishers of children 's books are trying to give us a clean , safe , juvenile literature , and while some nickel novel publishers are even admitting a decline in the sale of their wares ; in spite of these evidences of success , a warfare is still on , though its character is changing . Every librarian who has examined children 's books for a few years back knows exactly what to expect when she tackles the " juveniles " of 1913 . There will be a generous number of books so fine in point of matter and makeup that we shall lament having been born too late to read these in our childhood . The information and the taste acquired by children who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years is perfectly amazing , and those extremists who decry the buying of any books especially written for children are nearly as nonsensical as the ones who would buy everything the child wishes . But when one has selected with satisfaction perhaps a hundred and fifty titles , one begins to get into the potboiler class  --  the written-to-order information book which may be guaranteed to kill all future interest in a subject treated in style so wooden and lifeless ; the retold classic in which every semblance to the spirit of the original is lost , and the reading of which will give to the child that familiarity which will breed contempt for the work itself ; the atrocious picture book modeled after the comic supplement and telling in hideous daubs of color and caricature of line the tale of the practical joker who torments animals , mocks at physical deformities , plays tricks on parents , teases the newlywed , ridicules good manners , whose whole aim , in short , is to provoke guffaws of laughter at the expense of someone 's hurt body or spirit . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together without discrimination from the literature of people among whom trickery and cunning are the most admired qualities ; there will be school stories in which the masters and studious boys grovel at the feet of the football hero ; in greater number than the above will be the stories written in series on thoroughly up-to-date subjects . I shall be much surprised if we do not learn this fall that the world has been deceived in supposing that to Amundsen and Scott belong the honor of finding the South Pole , or to Gen. Goethals the credit of engineering the Panama Canal . If we do not discover that some young Frank or Jack or Bill was the brains behind these achievements , I shall wonder what has become of the ingenuity of the plotter of the series stories  --  the " plotter " I say advisedly , for it is a known fact that many of these stories are first outlined by a writer whose name makes books sell , the outlines then being filled in by a company of underlings who literally write to order . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories , in which special emphasis is laid upon fair play and a sense of honor , is at the same time writing under another name books he is ashamed to acknowledge , we are not surprised at the low grade of the resulting stories . With the above extremes of good and poor there will be quantities on the border line , books not distinctly harmful from one standpoint  --  in fact , they will busily preach honesty and pluck and refinement , etc. , but they will be so lacking in imagination and power , in the positive qualities that go to make a fine book , that they can not be called wholly harmless , since that which crowds out a better thing is harmful , at least to the extent that it usurps the room of the good . These books we will be urged to buy in large duplicate , and when we , holding to the ideal of the library as an educational force , refuse to supply this intellectual pap , well-to-do parents may be counted upon to present the same in quantities sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by teachers the most gifted . There are two principal arguments  --  so-called  --  hurled at every librarian who tries to maintain a high standard of book selection . One is the " I read them when I was a child and they did me no harm " claim ; the other , based upon the doggedly clung-to notion that our ideal of manhood is a grown-up Fauntleroy , infers that every book rejected was offensive to the children 's librarian because of qualities dangerously likely to encourage the boy in a taste for bloodshed and dirty hands . Now , in this day when parents are frantically protecting their children from the deadly house fly , the mosquito , the common drinking cup and towel ; when milk must be sterilized and water boiled and adenoids removed ; when the young father solemnly bows to the dictum that he must n't rock nor trot his own baby  --  is n't it really matter for the joke column to hear the " did me no harm " idea advanced as an argument ? And yet it is so offered by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mosquito bites and school drinking cups , refuses to allow his child to risk what he now knows to be a possible carrier of disease . The " what was good enough for me is good enough for my children " idea , if soberly treated as an argument in other matters of life , would mean death to all progress , and it is no more to be treated seriously as a reason for buying poor juvenile books than a contention for the fetich doctor versus the modern surgeon , or for the return to the foot messenger in place of electrical communication . It would be tactless , if not positively dangerous , if we children 's librarians openly expressed our views when certain people point boastfully to themselves as shining products of mediocre story book childhoods . So I would hastily suppress this thought , and instead remind these people that , as a vigorous child is immune from disease germs which attack a delicate one , so unquestionably have thousands of mental and moral weaklings been retarded from their best development by books that left no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there are to-day alive many able-bodied men who cut their first teeth on pickles and pork chops , we do not question society 's duty to disseminate proper ideas on the care and feeding of children . Is n't it about time that we nailed down the lid of the coffin on the " did me no harm " argument and buried the same in the depths of the sea ? Another notion that dies hard is one assuming that , since the children 's librarian is a woman , prone to turn white about the gills at the sight of blood  --  or a mouse  --  she can not possibly enter into the feelings of the ancestral barbarian surviving in the young human breast , but must try to hasten the child 's development to twentieth century civilization by eliminating the elemental and savage from his story books . If those who grow hoarse shouting the above would take the trouble to examine the lists of an up-to-date library they might blush for their shallowness , that they have been basing their opinions on their memory of library lists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that womanly women and manly men are most successfully made by way of silly , shoddy , sorry-for-themselves girlhoods , or lying , swaggering , loafing boyhoods ; and it is the empty , the vulgar , the cheap , smart , trust-to-luck story , rather than the gory one , that we dislike . I am coming to the statement of what I believe to be the problem most demanding our study today . It is , briefly , the problem of the mediocre book , its enormous and ever-increasing volume . More fully stated it is the problem of the negatively as the enemy of the positively good ; of the cultivation of brain laziness by " thoughts-made-easy " reading . It is a republic 's , a public school problem , viz. : How is it possible to raise to a higher average the lowest , without reducing to a dead level of mediocrity the citizens of superior possibilities ? Our relation to publisher and parent , to the library 's adult open shelves of current fiction enter into the problem . The children 's over-reading , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these and many other perplexing questions grow out of the main one . I said awhile ago that the new education has had a tendency to make life too soft for children , and to give to their parents the belief that natural instincts alone are safe guides to follow in rearing a child . I hope I shall not seem to be a good old times croaker , sighing for the days when school gardens and folk dancing and glee clubs and dramatization of lessons and beautiful text-books and fascinating handicraft and a hundred other delightful things were undreamed-of ways of making pleasant the paths of learning . Heaven forbid that I should join the ranks of those who carp at a body of citizens who , at an average wage in America less than that of the coal miner and the factory worker , have produced in their schools results little short of the miraculous . To visit , as I have , classrooms of children born in slums across the sea , transplanted to tenements in New York , and to see what our public school teachers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the " incorrigible , " the blind , the anaemic  --  well , all I can say is , I do not recommend these visits to Americans of the stripe of that boastful citizen who , being shown the crater of Vesuvius with a " There , you have n't anything like that in America ! " disdainfully replied , " Naw , but we 've got Niagara , and that 'd put the whole blame thing out ! " For myself I never feel quite so disposed to brag of my Americanism as when I visit some of our New York schools . And yet , watching the bored shrug of the bright , well-born high school child when one suggests that " The prince and the pauper " is quite as interesting a story as the seventh volume of her latest series , a librarian has some feelings about the **25;37;TOOLONG method of educating our youth , which she is glad to find voiced by some of our ablest thinkers . Here is what J. P. Munroe says : " Many of the new methods . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of timidly placing a chair for him before a disordered banquet of heterogeneous studies , may produce ladylike persons , but they will not produce men . And when these modern methods go as far as to compel the teacher to divide this intellectual cake and pudding into convenient morsels and to spoon-feed them to the child , partly in obedience to his schoolboy cravings , partly in conformity to a pedagogical psychology , then the result is sure to be mental and moral dyspepsia in a race of milk-sops . " How aptly " spoon-fed pudding " characterizes whole cartloads of our current " juveniles " ! Listen to President Wilson 's opinion : " To be carried along by somebody 's suggestions from the time you begin until the time when you are thrust groping and helpless into the world , is the very negation of education . By the nursing process , by the coddling process you are sapping a race ; and only loss can possibly result except upon the part of individuals here and there who are so intrinsically strong that you can not spoil them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product of American schools , and contrasting their methods with those of his boyhood he says : " My school work was not adjusted to botany at nine years because I played with an herbarium , and at twelve to physics because I indulged in noises with home-made electric bells , and at fifteen to Arabic , an elective which I miss still in several high schools , even in Brookline and Roxbury . The more my friends and I wandered afield with our little superficial interests and talents and passions , the more was the straight-forward earnestness of the school our blessing ; and all that beautified and enriched our youth , and gave to it freshness and liveliness , would have turned out to be our ruin , if our elders had taken it seriously , and had formed a life 's program out of petty caprices and boyish inclinations . " And Prof. Munsterberg thrusts his finger into what I believe to be the weakest joint in our educational armor when he says , " As there is indeed a difference whether I ask what may best suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or whether I ask what Peter , the man , will need for the battle of life in which nobody asks what he likes , but where the question is how he is liked , and how he suits the taste of his neighbors . " What would become of our civilization if we were to follow merely the instincts and natural desires ? Yet is there not in America a tremendous tendency to the notion , that except in matters of physical welfare , the child 's lead is to be followed to extreme limits ? Do n't we librarians feel it in the pressure brought to bear upon us by those who fail to find certain stories , wanted by the children , on our shelves ? " Why , that 's a good book , " the parent will say , " The hero is honest and kind , the book wo n't hurt him any  --  in fact it will give the child some good ideas . " " Ideas . " Yes , perhaps . There is another educator I should like to quote , J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Whatever you would wish the child to do and become , that let him practice . We learn to do , not by knowing , but by knowing and then doing . Ethical teaching , tales of heroic deeds , soul-stirring fiction that awakens sympathetic emotions may accomplish but little unless in the child 's early life the ideas and feelings find expression in action and so become a part of the child 's power and tendency . . . " Now we believe with G. Stanley Hall that , " The chief enemy of active virtue in the world is not vice but laziness , languor and apathy of will ; " that " mind work is infinitely harder than physical toil ; " that ( as another says ) " all that does not rouse , does not set him to work , rusts and taints him the disease of laziness destroys the whole man . " And when children of good heritage , good homes , sound bodies , bright minds , spend hours every week curled up among cushions , allowing a stream of cambric-tea literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that though the heroes and heroines of these stories be represented as prodigies of industry and vigor , our young swallowers of the same are being reduced to a pulp of brain and will laziness that will not only make them incapable of struggling with a page of Quentin Durward , for example , but will affect their moral stamina , since fighting fiber is the price of virtue . Ours is , as I have said , a public education , a republic 's problem . To quote President Wilson again : " Our present plans for teaching everybody involve certain unpleasant things quite inevitably . It is obvious that you can not have universal education without restricting your teaching to such things as can be universally understood . It is plain that you can not impart ' university methods ' to thousands , or create ' investigators ' by the score , unless you confine your university education to matters which dull men can investigate , your laboratory training to tasks which mere plodding diligence and submissive patience can compass . Yet , if you do so limit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delicacy of perception out of the schools , exalt the obvious and merely useful things above the things which are only imaginatively or spiritually conceived , make education an affair of tasting and handling and smelling , and so create Philistia , that country in which they speak of ' mere literature . ' " In our zeal to serve the little alien , descendant of generations of poverty and ignorance , let us not lose sight of the importance to our country of the child more fortunate in birth and brains . So strong is my feeling on the value of leaders that I hold we should give at least as much study to the training of the accelerate child as we give to that of the defective . Though I boast the land of Abraham Lincoln and Booker Washington I do not give up one iota of my belief that the child who is born into a happy environment , of parents strong in body and mind , holds the best possibilities of making a valuable citizen ; and so I am concerned that this child be not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training that fails to recognize his possibilities . It is encouraging to kind growing attention in the " Proceedings " of the N. E. A. and other educational bodies to the problem of the bright child who has suffered by the lock-step system which has molded all into conformity with the capabilities of the average child . The librarian 's difficulty is perhaps greater than that of the teacher , because open shelves and freedom of choice are so essential a part of our program . We must provide easy reading for thousands of children . Milk and water stories may have an actual value to children whose unfavorable heritage and environment have retarded their mental development . But the deplorable thing is to see young people , mercifully saved from the above handicaps , making a bee line for the current diluted literature for grown-ups , ( as accessible as Scott on our open shelves ) and to realize that this taste , which is getting a life set , is the inevitable outcome of the habit of reading mediocre juveniles . We must not rail at publishers for trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to influence that demand far more than we have done as yet . Large book jobbers tell us that millions and millions of poor juveniles are sold in America to thousands of the sort we librarians recommend . I have seen purchase lists of boys ' club directors and Sunday School library committees calling for just the weak and empty stuff we would destroy . I have unwittingly been an eavesdropper at Christmas book counters and have heard the orders given by parents and the suggestions made by clerks . And I feel that the public library has but skirmished along the outposts while the great field of influencing the reading of American children remains unconquered . Until we affect production to the extent that the book stores circulate as good books as the best libraries we can not be too complacent about our position as a force in citizen making . An " impossible " ideal , of course , but far from intimidating , the largeness of the task makes us all the more determined . This paper attempts no suggestion of new methods of attacking the problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I harp once more on a worn theme because I think that unless we frequently lift our eyes from the day 's absorbing duties for a look over the whole field , and unless we once and again make searching inventory of our convictions , our purposes , our methods , our attainments , we are in danger of letting ourselves slip along the groove of the taken-for-granted and our work loses in power as we allow ourselves to become leaners instead of leaders . May we not , as if it were a new idea , rouse to the seriousness of the mediocre habit indulged in by young people capable of better things ? Should not our work with children reach out more to work with adults , to those who buy and sell and make books for the young ? Is it not time for the successful teller of stories to children to use her gifts in audiences of grown people , persuading these molders of the children 's future of the reasonableness of our objection to the third rate since it is the enemy of the best ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the librarian to descend from her disdainful height and make friends with " the trade , " with bookseller and publisher who , after all , have as good a right to their bread and butter as the librarian paid out of the city 's taxes ? And then  --  is it not possible that we might be better librarians if we refused to be librarians every hour in the day and half the night as well ? What if we were to have the courage to refuse to indulge in nervous breakdowns , because we deliberately plan to play , and to eat , and to sleep , to keep serene and sane and human , believing that God in His Heaven gives His children a world of beauty to enjoy as well as a work to do with zeal . If we lived a little longer and not quite so wide , the gain to our chosen work in calm nerves and breadth of interest and sympathy would even up for dropping work on schedule time for a symphony concert or a country walk or a visit with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. L. A. conferences toward a trip to Italy ! This hurling at librarians advice to play more and work less reminds me of a story told by a southern friend . Years ago , in a sleepy little Virginia village , there lived two characters familiar to the townspeople , whose greatest daily excitement was a stroll down to the railroad station to watch the noon express rush through to distant southern cities . One of these personages was the station keeper , of dry humor and sententious habit , whom we will call Hen Waters ; the other was the station goat , named , of course , Billy . Year after year had Billy peacefully cropped the grass along the railroad tracks , turning an indifferent ear to the roar of the daily express , when suddenly one day the notion seemed to strike his goatish mind that this racket had been quietly endured long enough . With the warning whistle of the approaching engine , Billy , lowering his head , darted furiously up the track , intending to butt the offending thunderer into Kingdom Come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were gazing after the diminishing train , Hen Waters , addressing the spot where the redoubtable goat had last been seen , drawled out : " Billy , I admire your pluck  --  but darn your discretion ! " The parallel between the the ambitions and the futility of the goat , and the present speaker 's late advice is so obvious that only the illogicalness of woman can account for my cherishing a hope that I may be spared the fate of the indiscreet Billy . @# VALUES IN LIBRARY WORK WITH CHILDREN @# This second paper on Values in library work with children , was presented at the Kaaterskill Conference of the A. L. A. in 1913 by Caroline Burnite . In it are discussed " departmental organization as it benefits the reading child , and the principles and policies which have developed through departmental unity . " For inclusion in this volume it has been somewhat condensed by the author . Caroline Burnite was born in Caroline County , Maryland , in 1875 ; was graduated from the Easton , Maryland , High School in 1892 and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1901 she was librarian of the Tome Institute in Port Deposit , Maryland . She was an assistant in the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh from 1902 to 1904 , when she became Director of Children 's Work in the Cleveland Public Library , the position she now holds . Miss Burnite is also an instructor in the Western Reserve Library School . @# To elucidate principles of value , I shall use , by way of illustration , the experience and structure of a children 's department where the problem of children 's reading and the means of bringing books to them has been intensively studied for some nine years .... Probably about six out of ten of the children of that city read library books in their homes during the year , and each child reads about twenty books on the average . In all , fifty- four thousand children read a million books , which reach them through forty-three librarians assigned for special work with these children , through three hundred teachers and about one hundred volunteers . Now , we know that six out of ten children is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know also , inversely , that the volume of work entailed in serving fifty-four thousand children may endanger the quality of book service given to each child . Both of these conditions show that the experience of each reading child should make its own peculiar contribution to the general problem of children 's reading and that the experience of large numbers of reading children should be brought to bear upon the problem of the individual . To accomplish this , work with the children was given departmental organization . My concern in this paper is with departmental organization as it benefits the reading child , and with the principles and policies which have been developed through departmental unity . We think ordinarily that one who loves books has three general hallmarks : his reading is fairly continuous , there is a permanency of book interest , and this interest is maintained on a plane of merit . But in the child 's contact with the library there are many evidences of modifications of normal book interests . Instead of continuity of reading , the children 's rooms are overcrowded in winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanency of book interest extending over the difficult intermediate period , large numbers of those children who leave school before they reach high school have little or no library contact during their first working years , and without doubt the interesting experiences with working children , which librarians are prone to emphasize , give us an impression that a larger number are readers than careful investigation would show . And as for the quality of reading of many children who are at work we can not maintain that it is always on a high plane . Such results are largely due to environmental influences . Deprived for the greater part of the year at least , of opportunity for normal youthful activities , the child 's entire physical and mental schedule is thrown out of balance and he turns to reading , a recreation at his service at any time , only when there is little opportunity to follow other interests . Since the strain upon the ear and the eye , and back and brain is so great in the shop , the tendency in the first working years is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . The power of the nickel library over the younger boy and girl can be broken by the presence of the public library , but the quality of the reading of the intermediate is often due to the popularity of the mediocre modern novel , with its present-day social interests . For these and other reasons , the whole judgment of the results of library work with children can not rest upon such general tests of normal book interests as we have stated . Rather such variations from the normal are themselves conditions which influence the structure of the work and especially the principles of book presentation . Children with pressing social needs must have books with social values to meet those needs ; chiefest of these are right social contacts , true social perspective , traditions of family and race , loveliness of nature , companionship of living things , right group association and group interests . Starting with the principle that books should construct a larger social ideal for the greater number of children instead of confirming their present one , it was first necessary to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books with various interests are . Such knowledge was supplemented by the recorded testimony of men and women of their indebtedness to children 's books , especially such as " Tom Brown " and " Little Women , " and especially of their youthful appreciation of the relationships and interdependence of the characters . After we were able to evaluate books and to have some definite idea of which were good and which poor , the question arose : Should we have books with manifestly weak values in the library as a concession to some children who might not read the better books , or by having them do we harm most those very children to whom we have conceded them ? The gradual solution of this problem seems to me to be one of the greatest services which a library can render its children . A safe answer seems to be : No books weak in social ideals should be furnished , provided we do not lose reading children by their elimination . If such books are the best a child will read , and we take them away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apt to come under even less favorable influences . Another problem which arose was that the cumulative experience of librarians working with children showed that many books , weak in social viewpoint , lead only to others of their kind , and that such books are the ones read largely by those children which are most occasional and spasmodic in their reading . Here was a determining point in the establishment of standards of reading , for it brought us face to face with the question : Shall we consider this situation our fault since we supply such books to children who need something better vastly more than do children in happier circumstances , or shall we merely justify our selection by maintaining that those children will under no circumstances read a higher grade of books ? However , observation showed that other books were read also by children with social limitations ; books which , although apparently no better , lead to a better type of reading , and this prompted the policy of the removal of books which had little apparent influence in developing a good reading taste . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an increasingly better standard of reading must mean that no children cease using the library , an end only made possible by a knowledge of the value of the individual book to the individual child . Now let us see what changes have been evolved in the book collections in the department under consideration : At first the proportion of books of the doubtful class to those which were standard was considered , and it was seen that this preponderance of the doubtful class should be decreased in order that a child 's chances for eventually reading the best might be improved . It is obvious that the reading for the younger children should be the more carefully safeguarded , and this was the first point of attack . As a result , two types of books were eliminated : @# 1 . All series for young children , such as Dotty Dimples and Little Colonels. 2 . Books for young children dealing with animal life which have neither humane nor scientific value , such as Pierson and Wesselhoeft. @# Also stories of child life for young children were restricted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other hand , stories read by older girls in which adults were made the beneficiaries of a surprisingly wise child hero , such as the Plympton books , were eliminated . The successful elimination of these books , together with the study of the children 's reading as a whole , suggested later , that other books could be eliminated or restricted without loss of readers . In the course of time , the following results were accomplished : @# 1 . The restriction of the stories of the successful poor boy to those within the range of possibility , as are the Otis books , largely . 2 . The elimination of stories in which the child character is not within a normal sphere ; for instance , the child novel , such as Mrs. Jamison 's stories . 3 . Lessening the number of titles by authors who are undeservedly popular , such as restricting the use of Tomlinson to one series only . 4 . The restriction of any old and recognized series to its original number of titles , such as the Pepper series . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series . 5 . The elimination of travel , trivial in treatment and in series form , such as the Little Cousins . 6 . The elimination of the modern fairy tale , except as it has vitality and individual charm , as have those of George McDonald . 7 . The elimination of interpreted folk lore , such as many of the modern kindergarten versions . 8 . The elimination of word books for little children , and the basing of their reading upon their inherent love for folk lore and verse . Without analyzing the weakness of all these types , I wish to say a word about the series . This must be judged not only by content , but by the fact that in the use of such a form of literature the tendency of the child toward independence of book judgment and book selection is lessened and the way paved for a weak form of adult literature . The later policies developed regarding book selection have been these : @# 1 . Recognizing " blind alleys " in children 's fiction , such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying no new titles of those types . 2 . Lessening the number of titles of miscellaneous collections of folk-lore in which there are objectionable individual tales , for instance , buying only the Blue , Green and Yellow fairy books . 3 . The elimination , or use in small numbers , of a type of history and biography which is not scholarly , or even serious in treatment , such as the Pratt histories . 4 . The elimination of such periodical literature for young children , as the Children 's Magazine and Little Folks , since their reading can be varied more wholesomely without it . Reports of reading sequences from each children 's room have furnished the basis for further study of children 's reading . These are discussed and compared by the workers , a working outline of reading sequences made and reported back to each room , to be used , amplified and reported on again . While those books which are no longer used may have been at one time necessary to hold a child from reading something poorer , we did not lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtful books in the children 's room is less heavy now than it was a few years ago . This is shown by the fact that there are more than twice as many children who are reading , and almost three times as many books being read as there were nine years ago , while the number of children of the city has increased but 72 per cent . Furthermore , the proportion of children of environmental limitations has by no means diminished , and the foreign population is much the same  --  more than 74 per cent . Of course , the elimination of some books was accomplished because there were better books on the subject , but the general result was largely brought about because in the establishment of these higher standards we did not exceed the ideals and standards of those who were working with the children . The standards which they brought to the work , and which they deduced themselves from their experience , were crystalized through Round Table discussion , where each worker measured her results by those of the others and thereby recognized the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved that a children 's department can not reach standards of reading which in the judgment of librarians working with the children are beyond the possibility of attainment , for with them rests entirely the delicate task of the adjustment of the book to the child . A staff of children 's librarians of good academic education , the best library training , a true vision of the social principles ; a broad knowledge of children 's literature is the greatest asset for any library doing children 's work . But it is true , inversely , that in raising the standards of the children the standards of the workers were raised . By this I mean that with definite methods of book presentation in use , the worker saw farther into the mental and material life of the child and understood his social instincts better . This has been evidenced in the larger duplication of the better books . Among the methods are those which recognize group interest and group association as a social need of childhood . Through unifying and intensifying the thoughts and sympathies of the children by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the mediocre is often bridged and both the child and the worker reaches a higher plane of experience . Also by giving children a group interest , not only children recognize that books may be cornerstones for social intercourse and that there is connection between social conduct as expressed in books and their own social obligations , but what is also important , the worker learns that when children are at the age of group activity and expression they can often be more permanently influenced as a group than as individuals . This prompted the organization of clubs for older children . Through the recognition of the principle that there are methods of book appeal for use with individual children and other methods for groups of children , it was shown that the organization of the work as a whole must be such that the chief methods of presentation of literature could be fully developed . It was seen that , far less with a group of children than with the individual child , could we afford to give a false experience or an unfruitful interest , and that material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social elements which are evinced in groups of children should receive an amount of attention and study which would lead to the surest and soundest results . This could be fully accomplished only by recognizing such methods as distinct functions of the department . In other words , that there should not only be divisions of work with children according to problems of book distribution , such as by schools and home libraries , but there must be of necessity , divisions by problems of reading . Whereas , in a smaller department all divisions would center in the head , the volume of work in a large library renders necessary the appointment of an instructor in story-telling and a supervisor of reading clubs , which results in a higher specialization and a greater impetus for these phases of work than one person can accomplish . Here we have a concrete instance of the benefit that a large volume of work may confer upon the individual child . With the attainment of better reading results and higher standards for the workers , it is obvious that the reading experiences of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that the organization should protect the children , as far as possible , from the disadvantage of change of workers . Considerable study has been given to this , and yearly written reports on the reading of children in each children 's room are made , in which variations from accepted standards of the children 's reading in that library , with individual instances , are usually discussed . However , the children 's librarian is entirely free to report the subject from whatever angle it has impressed her most . Also a written report is made of the story hour , the program , general and special results , and intensity of group interest in certain types of stories . This report is supplementary to a weekly report in prescribed form , of the stories told , sources used and results . All programs used with clubs are reported and semi-annual report made of the club work as a whole . By discussion and reports back to individual centers , these become bases for a wider vision of work and a wiser direction of energy with less experimentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the reading of intermediates , referred to in the beginning , should not be dismissed in a paragraph . However , it is only possible to give a short statement of it . Recognizing that the reading of adult books should begin in the children 's room , a serious study of adult books possible for children 's reading was made by the children 's librarians , the reports discussed and the books added to the department as the result . A second report of adult titles which children and intermediates might and do read was called for recently and from that a tentative list had been furnished to both adult and children 's workers for further study . The increasing number of workers in the children 's department who have had general training , and in the adult work who have had special training for work with children make such reports of much value . In order to follow the standards of children 's work , there is one principle which is obvious , namely , a book disapproved as below grade for juveniles should not be accepted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adventure which a boy of any age between 12 and 18 would read . In conclusion , the chief means of determining values in library work with children are these : An intensive study of the reading of children in relation to its social and informational worth to them ; the right basis of education and training for such study , on the part of the workers ; the direction of such study in a way that brings about a higher and more practical standard on the part of the worker ; the conservation of her experience . These are the great services which the library may render children and they can be most fully accomplished , I believe , through departmental organization . @# ADMINISTRATION AND METHODS ; REFERENCE WORK ; DISCIPLINE @# The section devoted to administration and methods records the " expansion of the library ideal " in multiplying the sources from which books may be borrowed ; pictures the opportunities of the small library ; emphasizes the importance of personal work , since the " child must be known as well as the book " ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of books and as an advertising medium ; gives a thorough discussion of the use of the picture bulletin , and suggests systematic work with mothers as an important and resultful method . Four articles on reference work and instruction in library use bring out the importance of careful cataloguing , of thorough knowledge of resources , and of practical plans to enable the children to help themselves . Three articles on discipline present this sometimes difficult problem from varying viewpoints . It is said to resolve itself " into the exercise of great tact , firmness , and , again , gentleness . " Again , " many of the problems of discipline in a children 's room would cease to be problems if the material conditions of the room itself were ideal . " The Wisconsin report is of special value because it represents the experiences of small as well as of large libraries . It lays stress on some of the points brought out by Miss Dousman , who says : " In our zeal to control the child , some have lost sight of the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control himself ; that if he is to become a good citizen , he can not learn too early to respect the rights of others . " @# THE CHILDREN 'S ROOM AND THE CHILDREN 'S LIBRARIAN @# Some of the principles of library work with children , and the qualifications of a children 's librarian were discussed by Miss Eastman in the following paper read at the fourth annual meeting of the Ohio Library Association held in Dayton in 1898 . Linda Anne Eastman was born in Oberlin , Ohio , in 1867 ; was educated in the Cleveland Public Schools , and taught in the public schools of West Cleveland and Cleveland from 1885 to 1892 , when she became an assistant in the Cleveland Public Library . In 1895-1896 she was assistant librarian and cataloguer in the Dayton , Ohio , Public Library , and in 1896 became vice-librarian of the Cleveland Public Library , where she has since remained . Since 1904 she has been an instructor in the Library School of Western Reserve University . She was a charter member of the Ohio Library Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made frequent contributions to library periodicals . @# In the planning of a new library building , or the remodeling of an old one , there is no department to which I should give more thought in the working out of the details than in the children 's department , in order to best adapt the arrangement to its use . Its location in the building is the first matter for consideration . It should be easy of access from the main entrance , or , better still , have an entrance of its own directly from the outside , in order that the noise of the children may not become a disturbing element in the corridors and in other parts of the library . It would seem desirable , also , for many reasons , to have the children 's department not too far removed from the main circulating department . The children 's department in a large library should contain at least two large rooms , one for the reading and reference room , the other for the circulating books . The rooms should be light , bright and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is possible to make and keep them . Wall cases seem best for the shelving of the books , low enough for the children to reach the shelves easily . These low cases also allow wall space above for pictures , and plenty of this is desirable . A children 's room can not have too many pictures , 1 nor any which are too fine for it ; choose for it pictures which are fine , and pictures which " tell a story . " Provide , also , plenty of space for bulletins , for the picture bulletins have become an important factor in the direction of the children 's reading . One enthusiastic children 's librarian wrote me recently that her new " burlap walls , admitting any number of thumb-tacks " were the delight of her heart . There should be reading tables and rubber- tipped chairs , low ones for the little children ; and wherever there is space for them , the long , low seats , in which children delight to snuggle down so comfortably . @# 1 If this paper were now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have too many pictures . " The reaction against bare , bleak walls may not make it necessary to warn against over-decoration , but its undesirability should he recognized .  --  L. A. E. @# As to the arrangement of the books , I should divide them into three distinct classes for children of different ages : ( 1 ) The picture books for the very little ones , arranged alphabetically . ( 2 ) The books for children from seven to ten or twelve years of age . While these books should be classified for the cataloging , I should place them on the shelves in one simple alphabetical list by authors , mixing the fiction , history , travel , poetry , etc. , just as they might happen to come in this arrangement . I believe this would lead the children to a more varied choice in their reading , and that they would thus read and enjoy biography , history , natural science , etc. , before they learned to distinguish them from stories , whereas by the classified arrangement they would choose their reading much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) The books for boys and girls from ten or twelve years of age to fifteen or sixteen . These should be arranged on the shelves regularly according to class number , in order that the children may become acquainted with the classification and arrangement , learn to select their books intelligently , and be prepared to graduate from here into the adult library . Where it is possible to duplicate the simple and more common reference books in the juvenile department , these should form a fourth class . Then there should be all of the good juvenile periodicals , with some of the best illustrated papers , such as Harper 's weekly , for the reading room . With many libraries a children 's department on such a scale is an impossibility ; but if you can not give two rooms to the children give them one , and if you can not do that , at least give them a corner and a table which they can feel belongs to them ; and if you can not give them a special assistant , set apart an hour or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration  --  establish this as a custom , and both adults and children will be better served . Whatever one 's specialty in library work may be , however far removed from the work with the children , it is well to understand something of the principles which underlie this foundation work with the children . It is only recently that these principles have begun to shape themselves with any definiteness ; the children 's department , as a fully equipped miniature library , and the children 's librarian , as a specialist bringing natural fitness and special preparation to her work , are essentially the product of today ; but they have come to stay , and they open to the child-lover , and the educator who works better outside than inside of the schoolroom limits , a field enticing indeed , and promising rich results . It is to the pioneers in this field , the earnest young women who are now doing careful experimental work and giving serious study to the problems that arise  --  it is to them that the children 's departments of the future will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplement the influence of the schools , of the home , and of the church ; with some children it must even take the place of these other influences , and on its own account it must be a source of pleasure and an intellectual stimulus . If it is to accomplish all or any great part of this , not only for one , but for thousands of children , what serious thought and labor must go to its accomplishment ! The children 's librarian stands very close to the mother and the teacher in the power she can wield over the lives of the little ones . No one who lacks either the ability or desire to put herself into sympathetic touch with child-life should ever be assigned to work in the juvenile department , and the assistant who avowedly dislikes children , or who " has no patience with them , " will work disastrous results if allowed to serve these little ones with an unwilling spirit  --  she should be relegated to some department of the library to which the sunshine of childhood can never penetrate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the successful accomplishment of the juvenile work : @# ( 1 ) Love for children . This being given , the way is open for intimate knowledge and understanding of them , which are likewise essential . @# ( 2 ) Knowledge of children 's books . This is imperative if one is to give the right book to a child at the right time . Familiarity with the titles and with the outsides of the books is not enough , nor is it sufficient to know that a certain book is recommended in all of the best lists of children 's books . A child will often refuse to take what has been recommended to him as a good book , when , if he be told some graphic incident in it , or have some interesting bit pointed out or read to him , he will bear it off as prize ; with it , too , he will carry away an added respect for , and sense of comradeship with , the assistant , who " knows a good thing when she sees it , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his books the next time and the next , and so long thereafter as she can hold his confidence . Carefully prepared lists are most valuable in directing your attention to the best books , but after your notice has been called to them read them , form your own judgment on them , and if you recommend them , at least know why . What ? some one asks , attempt to read all of the best children 's books ? Yes , read them , and do more than that with some ; the children 's classics , the books which no child can grow up without reading and not be the poorer , with these one should be so familiar as to be able to quote from them or turn instantly to the most fascinating passages  --  they should form a constant part of her stock in trade . Other books one could not spend so much time on , nor is it necessary  --  the critical ability to go through a book quickly and catch the salient points in style , treatment and subject matter , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has to do with many books , and it therefore behooves her to cultivate what I once heard called the sixth sense , the book sense . @# ( 3 ) Knowledge of library methods . In any work , interest and enthusiasm go a great way , but they can never wholly take the place of accurate technical knowledge of the best ways of doing things . The more general knowledge of library work and methods one can bring to the children 's department , the better it will be both for the work and for the worker ; and given these methods , one must have ability to fit them to the conditions and to the peculiar needs to be accomplished , or , where they will not fit , to modify them or originate new ones which are better for the work in hand . ( 4 ) A thorough knowledge of the course of study of the public schools . This is very necessary in order to intelligently supplement the work of the schools . A child comes wanting information on some subject upon which his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something about the mayor  --  what , he can not tell you , but he was sent by his teacher to look up something about the mayor . You ask him what grade he is in , and he tells you the fourth . Your familiarity with the course of study should give you the clue at once , for the fourth grade topics in conduct and government include lessons on the city government , with its principal departments and officers , so you will look up , if you have not already done so , an outline of municipal government describing the position and duties of the mayor , which will be within the comprehension of the child . It should not happen that a dozen children ask for Little white lily , and be turned away without it , before it is discovered to be a poem by George MacDonald which the third grade children are given to read . This course of study the children 's librarian should  --  not eat and sleep with exactly , but verily live and work with ; it is one of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only within reach , at her finger 's end , but as much as possible at her tongue 's end , keeping pace with the assignment of work in the different grades and studies from month to month , and from week to week . She should know beforehand when a certain subject will be taken up by a certain grade , and have all available material looked up and ready , and new books bought if they will be needed and can be had  --  not wait until several hundred children come upon her for some subject on which a frantic search discloses the fact that the library contains not a thing suitable for their use , and then ask that books be bought , which , of course , come in after the demand is over , and stand idle upon the shelves for a whole year , taking the place of just so many more new books on subjects which will be needed later . The course of study , too , will furnish more useful hints for bulletins , exhibitions , reading-lists , and other forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not only in supplementing the school work , but also in directing the children in their general reading , is an intimate knowledge of the course of study an invaluable aid , as it gives you the unit of measurement for any child which enables you to correlate his reading along certain lines to that which has gone before , and to that which is to follow . ( 5 ) A knowledge of the principles of psychology and of education . I have placed last the requisite which I feel sure some theorists , at least , would place first , because I believe that , as a rule , it will come last in point of time , and will be worked up to through the preceding stages of the development of the children 's librarian ; but her work will not be grounded upon a firm foundation until she has consciously mastered these principles , and clearly outlined her own work , this new work of the book , in perfect harmony with them . There are many features of the children 's work which I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do no more than mention a few of them . One of these is the Library league , with its threefold object of training the children in the proper care of books , of serving as an advertising medium for the library among the children themselves , and of furnishing a means of directing the reading of hundreds of children who can not be reached individually . The possibilities of the league are beyond anything we have been able to realize . Another thing is the necessity of guarding against letting children read too much , or too entirely along one line . There is a habit of reading along lines which deaden , instead of stimulating , thought , and the habit , if carried to excess , becomes a mental dissipation which is utterly reprehensible ; but the pathway to this habit is entered upon so innocently and unconsciously by the story-loving child that he ( perhaps more often she ) must be guided very tenderly and wisely past its dangers ; the library which ignores this necessity may have much harm laid at its doors . The importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for systematic instruction in the use of books was emphasized in the report of the library section of the National Educational Association at Washington this summer ; it is a necessity which must be met somewhere and somehow . Of one more thing I should speak because of its provision for the children  --  the expansion of the library ideal ; not so many years ago branch libraries and traveling libraries were unknown ; now we feel that one library is not enough for a large city ; it must have branch libraries and delivery stations to take the books to the people , while traveling libraries carry them into the scattered districts in the country . For the future , we have visions of a system of libraries so complete that in no town or country district of the state will a little child be deprived of the pleasure of good books ; and wherever it is possible to put a live , warm-hearted , sympathetic and child-loving woman as the medium between the library and the child , it will be done . Library work in its entirety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else in its whole range is there such a labor of love as is hers who tries to bring the children early to their heritage in the beautiful world of books . @# WORK WITH CHILDREN IN THE SMALL LIBRARY @# The blessings rather than the limitations of the small library are portrayed and the " possibility of personal , individual , first-hand contact with the children " is emphasized in this paper presented by Miss Clara W. Hunt at the Niagara Conference of the A. L. A. in 1903 . A sketch of Miss Hunt appears on page 135. @# As the young theological student is prone to look upon his first country parish as a place to test his powers and to serve as a stepping-stone to a large city church , so the librarian of the country town who , visiting a great city library and seeing books received in lavish quantities which she must buy as sparingly as she buys tickets for expensive journeys out of her slender income , a beautifully furnished , conveniently equipped apartment especially for the children , for the student , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only for the necessities but also for the luxuries of library life  --  so it is quite natural for such a visitor to heave a deep sigh as she returns to her library home and contrasts her opportunities , or limitations as she would call them , with those of the worker in a numerically larger field ; and quite natural is it for her to long for a change which she feels would mean a broadening and enlarging of outlook and opportunity . It is encouraging sometimes to look at our possessions through other people 's spectacles , and perhaps I may help some worker in a small field to see in what she calls her limitations , not a hedging in but an opening , by drawing the contrast from another point of view  --  from that of one who is regretfully forced to give up almost all personal , individual work with the children and delegate to others that most delightful of tasks , because her library is so large and she has so much money to spend that her services are more needed in other directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have charge of a small library , I am going to enumerate some of my reasons for having this feeling . I should explain , in this connection , that my thoughts have centered about the small town library , the library whose citizen supporters do not yet aggregate a population large enough to admit to dignifying their place of residence with the name of a city , a place , therefore , where the librarian may really be able to know every citizen of prominence , every school principal and teacher , the officers of the women 's clubs , many of the mothers of the children she hopes to reach , and a very large number of the children themselves . What are the attractions in a spot like this , the compensations which make up even for the lack of a large amount of money to spend ? Let me begin first with the less apparent advantages , the " blessings in disguise , " I should call them . The first is the necessity for economy in spending one 's appropriation . I imagine your astonishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count the need of economy as any cause for congratulation . But let us look for a moment at some of the things you are saved by being forced to be " saving . " The greatest good to your public and to yourself is that you must think of the ESSENTIALS , the " worth while " things first , last and always . You can not afford to buy carelessly . Every dollar you spend must bring the best return possible and to the greatest number of people . Every foolish purchase means disappointment to your borrowers and wear on your own nerves . So , instead of being able to order in an off-hand way many things which may be desirable but which are really not essential , one gets a most valuable training in judgment by this constant weighing of good , indifferent and indispensable . To apply this to the principle of the selection of children 's books  --  and nothing in work with children , except the personality of the worker with them is so important as this , we can not buy everything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an argument that must have a show of reasonableness to those borrowers who advocate large purchases of books you tell them your income will not cover . What are the essentials in children 's books if your selection must be small ? Our children can grow up without Henty . They must not grow up without the classics in myth and fable and legend , the books which have delighted grown people and adults for generations , and upon the child 's early acquaintance with which depends his keen enjoyment of much of his later reading , because of the wealth of allusion which will be lost to him if he has not read aesop and King Arthur and the Wonder Book , Gulliver , Crusoe , Siegfried and many others of like company , in childhood . Then the librarian can not afford to leave out collections of poetry . Her children must have poetry in no niggardly quantity , from Mother Goose and the Nonsense Book to our latest , most beautiful acquisitions , " Golden numbers " and the " Posy ring . " And American history and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly replenished . So must fairy tales , the best fairy tales  --  Andersen , Grimm , the Jungle books , MacDonald , Pyle , " The rose and the ring . " Much more discrimination must be exercised in selecting the nature and science books than is usually the case . But , of course , most of the problems come when we are adding the story books . Here , most of all , the necessity for economy ought to be a help . It is a question of deciding on essentials , and having nerve enough to leave out those books whose only merits are harmlessness , and putting in nothing that is not positively good for something . The threadbare argument that we must buy of the mediocre and worse for the children who like such literature ( principally because they know little about any other kind ) will look very thin when we squarely face the fact that by such purchases we shut out books we admit to be really better , and when we honestly reflect upon the purpose of the public library . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those librarians who argue in favor of buying all the bootblack stories the boys want , was that of Miss Haines at a recent institute for town libraries . She asked that those men and women who enjoyed Alger and " Elsie " in childhood and who are arguing in their favor on the strength of the memory of a childish pleasure , take some of their old favorites and re-read them now , read them aloud to their young people at home , and then see if they care to risk the possibility of their own children being influenced by such ideals , forming such literary tastes as these books illustrate . Most of us desire better things for our children than we had ourselves . If a man was allowed to nibble on pickles and doughnuts and mince pie and similar kinds of nourishment before he cut all his teeth , miraculously escaping chronic dyspepsia as he grew older , he does not for that reason care to risk his boy 's health and safety by allowing him to repeat the process . A child 's taste , left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his choice of reading than is his choice of food . What human boy would refuse ice cream and peanuts and green pears and piously ask for whole-wheat bread and beefsteak instead ? Or choose to go to bed at eight o'clock for his health 's sake , rather than enjoy the fun with the family till a later hour ? It seems such a senseless thing for us to feel it our duty to decide for the children on matters relating to their temporary welfare , but to consider them fit to decide for themselves on what may affect their moral and spiritual nature . Not only in the selection of books as to their contents , but in the study of the editions the most serviceable for her purposes , will the town librarian gain valuable training from the necessity of being economical . The point is worth enlarging upon , but the time is not here . It will perhaps be harder to look upon the impossibility of having a separate room for the children as a blessing which enforced economy confers . It will doubtless seem heresy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet while we recognize the great desirability , the absolute necessity in fact , for the separate room in order to get the best results in a busy city library , we can see the many advantages to the children of their mingling with the grown people in the town library . It is good for them , in the public as in the home library , to browse among books that are above their understanding . It is better for the small boy curiously picking up the Review of Reviews to stretch up to its undiluted world news than to shut into his Little Chronicle or Great Round World . It is good for the American child to learn just a little of the old fashioned " children should be seen and not heard " advice , to learn at least a trifle of consideration for his elders by restraining his voice and his heels and his motions within the library , saving his muscles for the wildest exercise he pleases out of doors . The separate children 's room is too apt to become a place for so persistently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a library atmosphere which is one of the lessons of the place he should NOT miss . I am of the opinion that , while we want to do everything in the world to attract the children to the library and the love of good reading , they should have impressed upon them so constantly the feeling that the children 's room is a reading and study room that when a child is wandering around aimlessly , not behaving badly but simply killing time , he should be , not crossly nor resentfully , but pleasantly advised to go out into the park to play , as he does n't feel like reading and this is a LIBRARY . I know that this has an excellent effect in developing the right idea of the purpose of the place . Sometimes the town library has a building large enough to admit of a separate room for the children , and books and readers in such numbers as would make the use of this room desirable , but there is not money enough to pay the salary of an attendant to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This idea that the children must be watched all the time , that they can not be left alone a minute , is fatal to all teaching of honor and self-restraint and self-help . It will take time and determination and tact , but I know that it is possible to train the children  --  not the untrained city slum children perhaps , but the average town children  --  to behave like ladies and gentlemen left almost entirely to themselves through a whole evening . I must hardly allude to further blessings which to my mind the need of economy insures . It all comes under the head , of course , of forming the habit of asking " What is most worth while ? " before rushing headlong into thoughtless imitation of the larger library 's methods , regardless of their wisdom for the small one . The town librarian will thus be apt to use some far simpler but equally effective style of bulletin than the one that means hours of time spent in cutting around the petals of an intricate flower picture , or printing painstakingly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to print for her , thus making a slip to thumb tack on her board without a minute 's waste of time . The question of having insufficient help gives an excuse for getting a personal hold on some of the bright older boys and girls who can be made to think it a privilege to have a club night at the library once in a while , when they will cut the leaves of new books and magazines , paste and label and be useful in many ways . Of course they have to be managed , but you can get a lot of fine work out of assistants of this sort , and do them a great amount of good at the same time . Another of the blessings for which the town librarian may be thankful is that her rules need not be cast iron , but may be made elastic to fit certain cases . Because the place is so small that she can get to know pretty well the character of its inhabitants , she need not be obliged to face the crestfallen countenance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a library card , is told that she must bring her father or mother to sign an application , and who knows that that will be a task impossible of performance . The town librarian may dare to take the very slight risk of loss , and issue the card at once , enjoying the pleasure of making one small person radiantly happy . Then there is the satisfaction of doing a little of everything about your library with your own hands and knowing instantly just where things are when you are asked . To illustrate from a recent experience of my own . At one of the small branches or stations rather , of the Brooklyn Public Library , a certain small boy used to appear at least two or three times a week and ask the librarian , " Have you got the ' Moral pirates ' yet ? " And over and over again the librarian was forced wearily to answer , " No , not yet , Sam . " Now , although the library 's purchases of children 's books are very generous , running from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course with such large purchases it is necessary to systematize the buying by getting largely the same 50 titles for all branches , varying the number of copies per branch according to each one 's need . The branch librarian of whom I am speaking did not feel like asking often for specials , realizing that she was only one of many having special wants , and knowing that we would in time reach the " Moral pirates " in the course of our large , regular monthly purchases . But one afternoon I went up to this station and helping at the charging desk , this small boy appeared asking me for the " Moral pirates . " The librarian told me of the hopeful persistence of his request , and it did not take long after that to get the " Moral pirates " into the small boy 's hands . I only hope the realization of a long anticipated wish did not prove to him like that of many another , and that his disappointment was not too unbearable in finding a pirate story minus cutlasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of this tale is , that in a great system it is impossible often to get as close to an individual as in this case , while the town librarian , who does everything from unpacking her books to handing them out to her borrowers , can many a time have the personal pleasure of seeing a book into the right hands . I have only indirectly alluded to the greatest joy of all , the possibility of personal , individual , first-hand contact with the children whom you can get to know so well and to influence so strongly , and another joy that grows out of it  --  seeing results yourself . We are so ready to be deceived and discouraged by numbers ! The town librarian reads of a tremendous circulation of children 's books in a city library , and straightway gets the blues over her own small showing . But I beg such an one to think rather of what the QUALITY of her children 's use of the library may be as compared with that of the busy city library . A great department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in a few minutes of time , that in spite of every effort , something of the mechanical must creep into its administration . The town librarian may know by name each child who borrows her books . Not only that , but she may know much of his ancestry and environment and so be able to judge the needs of each one . She will not be so rushed with charging books by the hundred that she can not USE that knowledge to help him in the wisest , most tactful manner . But the joy of watching her children develop , of seeing a boy or girl whom she helped bring up , grow into a manhood and womanhood of noble promise , of feeling that she had a large influence in forming the taste of this girl , in sending to college that lad who would n't have dreamed of such a thing had he not been stirred to the ambition through the reading taste she awakened in him  --  these are pleasures the city children 's librarian is for the most part denied . The latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best , she can make her room as attractive as money will admit , she can choose her staff with great care . She knows that good must result in the lives of many and many a child from contact even in brief moments with people of strong magnetic personality , and from constantly taking into their minds the sort of reading she provides . But very rarely will she be permitted to see the results in individual cases that make work seem greatly worth while , and that compensate in a few brief minutes , for weeks and months and years of quiet , uninspiring , plodding effort . And so I congratulate the worker with children in the small library . It would be a delight to me if I could feel that my appreciation of the blessings that are yours might help you to look upon your opportunity as a very great and worthy one . The parents of the small town need your help , the teachers can not carry on their work well without you , the boys and girls would miss untold good if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs the benefit of the practical judgment your all-round training gives . And so you may believe of your position that though in figures your annual report does not read large , in quality of work , in power of influence it reads in characters big with significance , radiant with encouragement . @# PERSONAL WORK WITH CHILDREN @# " The whole secret of success is really to be in sympathy with children , quick to see their needs and to look at things from their point of view ; but above all to have a genuine , common-sense love for them . " This point of view is expressed in the following paper on Personal work with children , read by Miss Rosina Gymer before the Ohio Library Association annual meeting in 1905 . Rosina Charter Gymer was born in Cleveland , Ohio ; received a special certificate from the Training School for Children 's Librarians in 1904 ; was children 's librarian in the Cleveland Public Library from 1904 to 1907 ; supervisor of children 's work in small branches from 1907 to 1910 , and since that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so large in its scope and so rich in its possibilities that we shall only consider work in the library proper , passing over home visiting , school visiting and cooperation with social settlements and like institutions , all of which , however , are of the greatest importance to the work as a whole . Work with children may be grouped under three heads  --  that with girls , that with boys and that with little children . While in each group the work differs in nearly every point , one point they have in common  --  the choosing of fiction according to the individual child , boy or girl ; the choosing of classed books for the book itself . In giving fiction , the child must be known as well as the book , his character and needs , for it is on the character that fiction has most influence . In classed books , on the other hand , the book is the thing to know , for if a child wants to know something about electricity or carpentry , he is not being influenced so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not as good as some other , it will not injure him especially as to morals and character , but of course he should have the very best you can give him that he can mentally understand . Girls almost always become interested in books through the personality of the children 's worker . While it is very desirable to use this regard as a means of influencing their reading , care must be taken to guard against a merely sentimental attitude on the part of the girls toward the worker . As a rule , girls want stories about people , other girls , school stories and so forth , and will take a book that you say is a good one without looking into it . If she likes it she will come to you to select another , and in this way you can lead her from pure fiction to historical fiction and biography and so on up to good literature , all through , at the first , knowing a book that would please and attract her . This is done , in great measure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through her interest in people rather than things . Boys , on the other hand , are not so much interested in people as in things , and when they ask for a book it is usually on some specific subject  --  electricity , carpentry , how to raise pigeons , how to take care of dogs . When the book is given them they usually examine it pretty thoroughly to see whether or not it is what they want or can use . To know what book will give the boy what he wants to know and in the most interesting way is to gain that boy 's confidence . To sum up : Boys like you through the books you give them , while girls learn to like good books through their liking for you . The result is the same in either case  --  the personal influence of the worker with the children . The problem of managing children is much the same everywhere . Wherever they are there are sure to be some restless and disobedient boys and girls whose confidence and good will must be gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The children 's worker must be for and not against the child . To win is far better than to compel . Conquering may do for those who are expected to remain as enemies , but friends are won . While a display of authority should be avoided , a firm attitude must at times be taken , but it should be an attitude of friendship and fairness . If a loss to the child of some coveted pleasure can be made to follow his fault it is an effectual punishment . For instance , if a boy never misses the story and yet his general behavior in the library leaves a good deal to be desired , do not allow him to attend the story hour for one or two weeks . In extreme cases the plan of not allowing the boys to come to the library for a number of days or weeks has been tried with good results . An endeavor should be made so far as possible to follow the inclinations of children . Every boy likes the idea of belonging to a club and if advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help in discipline . When a gang of boys comes to the library night after night , apparently for no reason except to make trouble , the best solution of the problem is to form them into a reading circle or club . They usually prefer to call themselves a club . A good plan in starting is to ask three or four of the troublesome boys if they would like to come on a certain evening and hear a story read . An interesting story is selected , carefully read and cut if too long , and at the end of the evening the boys are invited to bring some of their friends with them next time . It is well to begin in this small way and thus avoid the mistake of having too many boys at the start or of getting boys of different gangs in the same club , for this will always cause trouble . Seven o'clock is a good time for them to meet . If the hour is later the boys who come early get restless and it is difficult for them to fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a separate room as their attention is easily distracted from the reading by people passing back end forth . It is a great effort for boys with , one might say , wholly untrained minds to concentrate for any length of time , and it is well not to ask them for more than half an hour at first . Unless the selection holds their interest they will disappear one after another , for they simply refuse to be bored . For this reason , begin with popular subjects , such as animal stories , Indian stories , fire stories , railroad stories , gradually leading them on to more solid reading . That this can be done was proved by the boys ' attention to Sven Hedin 's account of his search for water in his Through Asia . The incident is most graphically told of the repeated disappointments , of the sufferings of the caravan and the dropping out of one after another until only the author is left staggering across the sand hills in his search for the precious water . The boys listened breathlessly until one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find no water ? Very often the subject of the next evening 's reading is determined by the boys themselves who , if they have been particularly interested , will ask for another story " just like that only different . " If possible , have good illustrated books to show them on the subject of the evening 's reading . This serves two purposes  --  it fixes the awakened interest of the boys and it also prevents the rush for the door they are apt to make to work off the accumulated energy of the hour of physical inactivity . In libraries where there are few assistants it ought not to be difficult to find some young man or woman interested in work of this sort to come and read to the boys once or twice a week , but the same person should have the club regularly . Work with little children is important because in a year or two they are going to be readers , and yet they are a problem to the busy librarian from the fact that they require a good deal of attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them to come to the library , say Saturday morning at ten , when they can feel that the children 's worker is all their own . They like to be read to , but they love to hear stories told . Telling stories to them is a great pleasure to the story-teller , because of their responsiveness , their readiness to enjoy . But besides the enjoyment of the children there is something far higher to work for  --  the development of the moral sense . The virtues of obedience , kindness , courage and unselfishness are set forth over and over again in the fairy tale . The story East o ' the sun and west o ' the moon , is nothing but a beautiful lesson in obedience , The king of the golden river in unselfishness , Diamonds and toads , kindness  --  and many others could be named , all with a lesson to be learned . Little children love repetition and when a story pleases them ask for it again and again . They do not see the lesson all at once , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of their very life . This is where the fairy tale , properly and judiciously used , does its great work . Be most careful to give children stories that are wholly worthy of their admiration . Know your story thoroughly and in telling it present strong , clear pictures . Tell the story in such a way that the child 's heart swells within him and he says , I can do that , I could be as brave as that . But let not the children 's worker labor under the delusion that when she closes the door of the library her work is finished . On the contrary , another phase of it is only beginning , for she is constantly meeting the children on the street , in the stores , in fact almost everywhere she goes , and it behooves her to be on the watch for friendly smiles , to listen with interest when Johnny tells her that Mary is coming out of the hospital tomorrow , or when Mike calls across the street , Did you know Willie was pinched again ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out whether Willie is paroled under good behavior or whether he has been sent to a boys ' reformatory school ; or , when she is waiting for a street car and a newsboy rushes up and says he ca n't get his books back in time and will she renew them for him , the children 's worker takes his library number and renews the books when she returns to the library . If the worker is at all earnest in her work she can not help but have her heart wrung time and again by the sufferings of the children of the poor . Not that they complain  --  they take it all as a matter of course , but by some unconscious remark they quite often throw an almost blinding light on their home conditions showing that family life for a good many of them is anything but easy and pleasant . Children of the poor often have responsibilities far beyond their years , and the library with its books , pictures , flowers and story-telling means much more to them than to a child who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old came one afternoon and was so disappointed to find there was to be no story . On being told to come at ten o'clock next morning , she said : What , do you think I can get here at ten o'clock with four kids to dress ! As first heard , funny ; but after all showing a pathetic side , a childhood without childhood 's freedom from care . The whole secret of success is really to be in sympathy with children , quick to see their needs and to look at things from their point of view ; but above all to have a genuine , common sense love for them so that we may feel as did the little girl who missed one of the assistants , and asking for her was told that she was taking a vacation . I love her , said the child , and then , fearing she had hurt the feelings of the one to whom she was speaking added , I love all the library teachers , ' cos we 're all childs of God . @# THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S WORK IN THE CLEVELAND PUBLIC LIBRARY @# The interesting experiment of conducting a Library League is described by Miss Linda A. Eastman in the following account of the children 's work in the Cleveland Public Library . A sketch of Miss Eastman appears on page 159. @# Work with the children assumed its first real importance in the Cleveland Public Library when the library began , about 10 years ago , to issue books to the teachers for reissue to their pupils . This brought the books to the hands of thousands of children who had never drawn them before , although at no time has the library been able to furnish all of the books asked for by the teachers . The next step came with the establishment of our branches , where it was soon noticed that a most important part of the work done was that with the children , and that very few of these children had ever used the main library . Early in 1897 a notable change was made at the main library in bringing all of the juvenile books together in what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained the juvenile fiction only , the classed books having been shelved with the other books on the same subject . This change meant much planning and shifting in our cramped quarters , and writing of dummies and changing of records for every book ; but it proved to be well worth all the work , for the children seldom went beyond this alcove , and those who had been reading fiction only , began to vary it with history , travel , science , until about half of the books issued from the department are now from the other classes . During the Christmas holidays , 1896 , we advertised " Children 's week , " and the numbers and evident enjoyment of the children who then accepted the invitation to visit the library or its branches , led to similar plans for the spring vacation . At this time we were able to put into circulation about a thousand bright new books , and the desire to impress upon the children the necessity for their proper care resulted in starting the Library League , the general plan of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the details concerning it. 2 @# 2 For accounts of the Library League , see Library Journal October and November , 1897. @# Without question , the labor spent upon the Library League has been more than repaid in the greater care which the children take of their library books . Dirt is at a discount ; it is noticed that many more children than formerly now stop to choose the cleanest copy of a book , and many are the books reported daily by the little people as being soiled or torn . A boy , not long ago , brought a book up to the information-desk , reported a loose leaf , then very seriously , by way of explanation , opened his overcoat and displayed his league badge ; another replied in all good faith to a query about a damaged book , " Why , I belong to the Library League "  --  proof quite sufficient , he thought , to clear him of any doubt . Most of the children stop at the wrapping- counter before leaving the library , to tie up their books in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many a book from a mud-bath on its way to or from the library . But aside from the better care of the books , the Library League has done much as an advertising medium among the children ; the league now numbers 14,354 , and many of its members had never used the library until they joined the league . Something has been accomplished through it , too , in directing the reading of the children , as it gives opportunities , in many ways , for making suggestions which they are glad to accept . At the South Side branch a club-room has been finished off in the basement , and two clubs formed among the members of the league : one , a Travel Club , is making a tour of England this winter ; the other is a Biography Club , which is studying great Americans ; the children who compose these two clubs are largely of foreign parentage , almost without exception from uncultured homes , and the work our earnest branch librarian is beginning with them can not fail in its effect on these young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at the new West Side branch , in addition to the children 's room , which is already proving inadequate . The Maxson book marks have been very useful in connection with the league , and have suggested a series of book marks which will also serve as bulletins for league notes , little lists of good books , suggestions about reading , etc . The color will be changed each time , as variety is pleasing to children . The **50;64;TOOLONG Cleveland Public Library . LIBRARY LEAGUE BOOK MARK NO. 1 . Boys and Girls : How would you like to have a new book mark every month or two with Library League news , and suggestions about good books ? That is what the Library is going to try to give you .

What the League has done : It has brought many children to the Library who never used it before . It has taught many boys and girls to love books and to handle them carefully with clean hands . Many books have been reported which were in bad condition , and the juvenile books are now in better shape than before the League began its work . Library League Reading Clubs : Some of the League members have been starting reading clubs . One of these clubs is a Travel Club , and another is a Biography Club . The Library assistants will be glad to tell League members about these clubs if they would like to form others . Library League Motto : Clean hearts , clean hands , clean books . ( OVER ) **50;116;TOOLONG @# The other side of this book mark contains a list of the juvenile periodicals in the library . No. 2 gives the beginning of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weave in hints on reading and on the care and use of books . At our main library the children have come in such numbers after school and on Saturdays , that it has been impossible to push the work much this past winter , for fear the adults should suffer . It was finally decided that we must achieve the impossible , and by shifting about and putting up glass partitions , have a separate children 's room instead of the open juvenile alcove . This room , while not half so large as it should be to meet the needs of the work , is indeed a great improvement in giving the children a place which they feel to be really their own ; the change has involved the re-registration of the children having cards here , but it is affording much needed relief at the general receiving desks , and will greatly facilitate the service to adults , at the same time making it possible to do much more for the little people . The library is endeavoring to co-operate more and more closely with the schools . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ever before . A new course of study having been published , all of the books referred to in it were looked up , and if not in the library or its branches , were purchased as largely as seemed desirable or possible . A list of " References for third-grade teachers , " compiled by Miss May H. Prentice , training teacher in the Cleveland Normal School , has recently been published by the library . It was given to all of the third-grade teachers of the city , and sold to others . This is , we believe , the most comprehensive list ever prepared for a single grade of the common schools . We are hoping that it will prove so helpful to third-grade teachers that all of the other grades will demand similar ones for themselves , and that somehow the way will be found to meet the demand . The list of books noted by Miss Prentice for the children 's own reading has been reprinted , without the annotations , in a little folder and 5,000 copies of it have just been distributed among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were treated to the largest exhibition ever made in the United States to photographic reproductions of the masterpieces in art ; to the work of the library in circulating pictures to teachers and children for school-room decoration and for illustration , is due no small share of this new interest in art . While the children come to the library daily to look up subjects in connection with their school work , very little attention can be given to training them to use reference books as tools . Somewhere , either in the school or the library , this systematic teaching should be given . It is one of the things which is not being done . And another thing is not being done  --  we are not reaching all of the children ; in spite of our branches , our stations , our books in the schools , our Library League , there are many children who sadly need the influence of good books , who are not getting them  --  whole districts shut off from the use of the library by distance and inability to pay carfare . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for lack of funds . It is a growing conviction in my own mind that the library , aside from its general mission , and aside from its co-operation with the schools in the work of education , has a special duty to perform for the city child . No one can observe city life closely without seeing something of the evil which comes to the children who are shut up within its walls ; the larger the city the greater is the evil , the more effectually are the little ones deprived of the pure air , the sweet freedom of the fields and woods , to be given but too often in their stead the freedom of the streets and the city slums . The evil is greater during the long vacations , when the five-hour check of the school room is entirely removed , and many a teacher will testify to the demoralization which takes place among the children who are then let loose upon the streets . For these the library must to some extent take the place of Mother Nature , for under present condition it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to know her ; books must furnish them with wholesome thoughts , with ideals of beauty and of truth , with a sense of the largeness of life that comes from communion with great souls as from communion with nature . If this be true , the school vacation ceases to be the resting time of the children 's librarian ; she must sow her winter wheat and tend it as in the past , but she must also gather in her crops and lay her ground fallow during the long summer days when school does not keep ; she must find ways of attracting these children to spend a healthy portion of their time among the books , always guarding against too much as against too little reading . For this work the individual contact is needed , and there must be more children 's librarians , more branch libraries . This necessity and the problem of meeting it require grave consideration by the librarian of to-day . @# PICTURE BULLETINS IN THE CHILDREN 'S LIBRARY @# The practical usefulness as well as the artistic merit of picture bulletins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Children 's Librarians for presentation at the Waukesha Conference of the A. L. A. in 1901 . It is based upon answers received in response to a circular letter sent to various libraries . Mrs. Mary E. S. Root was born and educated in Rhode Island , studied art before her marriage , became interested in children 's literature through her own children , and organized the children 's work in the Providence Public Library , where she still has charge of this work . She has held many offices in educational and civic organizations , and has lectured on children 's literature . For two summers she conducted a course in children 's work in the Simmons College Library School . Mrs. Adelaide Bowles Maltby was born in New York City , and was graduated from a private school in Elmira , New York , in 1893 , with an equivalent of one year 's college work . After completing the regular course in Pratt Institute Library School in 1900 , she spent six months in the Pratt Library , at the same time taking lectures in the second-year children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the Children 's Department in the Buffalo Public Library . She then became a member of the New York Public Library staff , first as special children 's worker in Chatham Square Branch , then as branch librarian there , and later as librarian of the Tompkins Square Branch . @# There has been a rather marked difference in activity between the eastern and western libraries on this subject of picture work , we of the east seeming more conservative , somewhat prone on the whole , because there is not time for elaborate work , to doubt its practical usefulness . The questions upon which this report is based were sent out in a circular letter to different libraries . These questions with their answers may be considered in order : Question 1 . If you make picture bulletins in your library , what is your object in so doing ? To supplement school work , advertise the books , stimulate non-fiction reading and celebrate anniversaries are the four answers which the majority give . There is no question but bulletins made for school helps are useful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all studying to do away with suggestions of a school atmosphere in our rooms as far as possible , so , primarily , these bulletins should give pleasure . They offer a strong point of contact between the children and the librarian , and if too strongly labelled with " school work , " do we not rob the child of the one place where he could have the indescribable charm of learning what his natural tastes prompt him to acquire ? It is easy enough in our libraries to teach without calling it teaching . Again , a bulletin to " advertise our books , " especially new ones , seems misdirected energy , as the new books are always eagerly sought and there is often need of checking in some way the desire for the new just because it is new . If the books to which the attention is directed by the bulletins enlarge the child 's experience , well and good , but we do not need to post a bulletin merely to circulate the books or with the feeling of advertisement in any sense of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to illustrate books owned by the library or are they general , commemorating anniversaries , etc ? The majority of bulletins seem of the most general character  --  book bulletins , illustrations of school work , holidays and anniversaries especially dear to childhood . Miss Putnam , of the library at Los Angeles , offers a most serviceable suggestion in her guide to the books in the children 's room : " This is composed of pictures , each representing a book clipped from the publisher 's catalogs , each author kept separate mounted on large sheets of tagboard , and when the author 's picture , call number , criticism of books are added , the sheets are kept on the tables for the children 's use . " At Detroit there is constantly on the walls a bulletin board about 28x32 in. covered with dark green burlap on which are placed lists of books , pictures of their authors , illustrations , current events , public affairs , etc. , not of sufficient interest to demand a separate bulletin . Some change is made in this every week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving the other as a fresh list is added . Question 3 . Of what material and by whom are your bulletins made ? The best material is classified clippings and pictures from duplicate magazines and illustrated papers . Braun &; Cie photographs , Perry prints , bird portraits from Chapman 's " Bird manual , " and from Birds and All Nature , Fitzroy prints and Perkins ' Mother Goose pictures can also be used to advantage . Card board can be obtained at slight cost , in some cities at $4.20 per hundred . Pulp board , book cover paper and charcoal paper , all can be utilized for this purpose . Where the book cases are low enough to admit of it , red denim stretched above the top of the cases makes an effective background for the bulletins . Where the cases are five feet in height this is not practicable , as the pictures must be opposite the eyes of our small readers . In the Providence Public Library an excellent substitute for this is in the shape of a six-panelled mahogany bulletin surrounding the large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mahogany serves as an excellent frame to the panel and the many sides offer opportunities for a series of bulletins on a given subject , each simple in itself and conveying one idea to the child , which seems far preferable to us than trying to crowd all on one bulletin . Other libraries use a stationary framework across the tables , with glass each side , so that pictures may be slipped in between . At Minneapolis Public Library an interesting experiment was tried with success by Mrs. Ellison . Arrangements were made with the Director of Drawing to have the pupils furnish the picture bulletins , Mrs. Ellison furnishing the subjects and doing the reference work . The making of bulletins in most cases devolves on the children 's librarian , but we hear from several libraries where different members of the staff take their turn , all showing a keen interest in gathering material . Questions 4 and 5 . Do you have more than one bulletin at a time ? Have you noticed any poor results from exhibiting more than one at a time ? The returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped . Two bulletins seem to be an accepted number , but more than that a question . We do not desire to confuse our children , or to detract in value from a bulletin when once posted , and most certainly not to cheapen our rooms ; but if the standard is held high in each case , the number would not matter . Take for instance a hero bulletin . Here is a wealth of material which overwhelms us , and even when we have selected with the utmost thought our heroes and placed them side by side , we realize we have more or less of a jumble and have not told our story simply enough . Some division is absolutely necessary . We saw a bulletin on this subject grouped under three excellent heads : When all the world was young ; In the glorious days of chivalry ; Heroes of modern times . We should like to adopt this suggestion , but instead of one , offer three bulletins , as a safeguard against confusion . Question 6 . Can you show by citing cases that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children to pay for time and money spent ? One library  --  and this is an eastern one  --  gives us an encouraging , inspiring reply : " Case after case , actually hundreds of letters from teachers thanking us for the work . " A general summary of reports from all the libraries shows an increased demand for the books on the subject posted . The perfectly evident pleasure of the little ones in the mere looking , to say nothing of their joy in telling at one time or another something they have seen before , shows with what keenness they observe . At the Buffalo Public Library there have been on exhibition some excellent silhouette pictures made by cutting figures , trees , etc. , from black paper and pasting them on white backgrounds . " The pied piper " was one subject illustrated . To appreciate this it should be understood that the figure of the piper and of each little rat , some not more than a half inch high , were cut with scissors , without any drawing whatever . These were labelled " Scissors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been up a week , one of the boys , 14 years old , brought in four , one of which was better in composition than any of those exhibited . This was posted as showing what one boy had done , and this boy is studying drawing and designing this summer , with good promise . Another library cites a case in relation to school work , where the superintendent of schools offered rewards in each school of five of Landseer 's pictures for the best five compositions on Landseer and his work . A collection of his pictures was gathered , a bulletin made with lists , which at once attracted the boys and girls , set many earnestly to work , who would not otherwise have given it much thought , and finally received the hearty commendation of the superintendent . Miss Clarke , of Evanston , says : " We have no children 's room , and have not done enough of bulletin work to be able to speak very surely of results . " Yet she can give us this , which speaks for itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the Indian curios and Navajo blankets I had all our books on Indian life and customs and our best Indian stories displayed , aroused a great demand for the books . I kept the list of Indian books and stories posted for some months , and it was worn out and had to be replaced by a new copy , owing to its constant use . Our boys at that time really read a great deal of good literature on the subject , including Mrs. Custer 's books and those by Grinnell and Lummis . " These are but a few of the many interesting illustrations , yet we all know there is a great part of our work of which we can see no results , but if these bulletins beautify the room , offer some new thought to the child and give pleasure , then the time and work spent on them is a small factor , and even in that we are the gainers , as we unconsciously acquire in the making of these bulletins much general information , and an ability to present subjects in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 . Are these bulletins allowed to circulate ? In most cases , no . Several libraries allow them to go to schools and a few make duplicates for both library and school , and in Indianapolis the bulletins are sent to other libraries in the state . This should prove very helpful to small libraries which are open but a few hours in the week . The bulletins may wear out , but a bulletin once planned , three quarters of the work is accomplished , and it is little labor to make the duplicate one . Question 8 . Please describe the exhibit which has proved of the greatest interest in the past year . We wish that time and space would allow a repetition of all the replies to this question . Miss Hewins says : " The exhibit which has proved of the greatest interest is on Queen Victoria . Within an hour after we heard the news of her death we had the bulletin for her last birthday and 40 portraits of her on our walls . I made one bulletin on her for the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about her . In this bulletin there were pictures of the dolls ' house and toys that she gave the nation and I told the children how careful she must have been of them to be able to keep them so many years , and something about how careful she was taught to be also of her spending money , and that even although she was a princess and lived in a palace , she never could buy anything until she had the money to pay for it . I made a Stevenson bulletin for them on his birthday , and we had Stevenson songs and a talk about him and his childhood , his lovableness , courage and cheerfulness . " At Buffalo the most popular exhibit was one illustrating the changes of the last century , taking the post-office methods , transportation of all kinds , i.e. , carriages , boats , railroads , electricity in all its uses and those which could be appreciated by the children  --  guns , lifesaving methods , diving , etc . In each instance an old and a new type was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the two months it was up , one of the pages who was interested in numbers having counted 60 an hour . Nature exhibits are always popular with children . " Our own birds " was the title of a bird- day bulletin at Evanston . A green poster board , on which were tied bunches of pussy-willows , among whose twigs were perched some of the common birds around Evanston , was used . The plates used were the nature study bird plates , brightly colored , which were cut out and pasted on the board in such a way that the effect was very lifelike . Much the same idea was carried out in Providence , only in this library the title is " Procession of the birds and flowers , " each bird being added as it arrives . At the same time in the class room adjoining this library there was an exhibit of 150 photographs called " Joy in springtime , " all being charming pictures of flowers , birds and happy children , with appropriate selections of poetry affixed . The long windows were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slide the tranparencies , that they may be changed from time to time . Invitations were sent to all the schools , and the exhibit was a great delight to the little ones . Miss Moore , of Pratt , tells of a picture bulletin illustrating life in Porto Rico and a companion bulletin illustrating the Porto Rican village at Glen island ( a summer resort accessible to the children ) , with objects such as water jugs , cooking utensils made from gourds , etc. , a hat in the process of making , musical instruments made from gourds , such as were used by the native band at Glen Island . The objects were carefully selected with the aid of the gentleman who instituted the village at Glen Island , and who had made a study of the country and people of Porto Rico . " The bulletin led not so much to the reading of books , because there are few on the subject , but it gave the children a very clear idea of the manner of living of the Porto Ricans and drew the attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point as well as a pleasure resort . " Question 9 . Do you do anything with Perry pictures , scrap books , etc. , for the little children ? At Medford scrap books are made by the children themselves , much to their delight . Several librarians make their own scrap books , Miss Hammond , of St. Paul , sending perhaps the best description of work of this nature . For the little children she always keeps on hand several scrap books made from worn out books , by Howard Pyle and Walter Crane . Other scrap books enjoyed alike by the older children and the little ones are " Colonial pictures " and " Arctic explorers , " the last especially liked by the boys . Miss Hammond also cuts whole articles from discarded magazines , putting on heavy paper covers , labelling and arranging in a case according to subject for the use of teachers and pupils . Question 10 . Mention five examples of pictures suitable for a children 's library . The pictures suggested are given in order , according to the number of votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 Watts , Sir Galahad , 6 Guido Reni , Aurora , 4 Bonheur , Horse fair , 4 King Arthur , ( Chapel of Innspruck ) , 3 Corot , Landscape , 3 Hardie , Meeting of Scott and Burns , 2 St. Gaudens , Shaw monument , 2 Murillo , Children of the shell , 2 Stuart , Washington , 2 Van Dyck , Baby Stuart , 2 @# The selection of these pictures must , of course , depend on the library , but there are a few other suggestions which are worthy of mention : Regnault , Automedon and the horse of Achilles . Raphael 's Madonna of the chair . Reynolds , Penelope Boothby . Question 11 . In preparing your lists of books to accompany bulletin , do you prepare an analytical list or refer to book only ? An analytical list seems preferable where any list is used , although some librarians seem to question the advantage of lists . Miss Brown , of Eau Claire , says : " I have , however , decided for myself that the bulletin that pays is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long list of books . If the child is interested in the bulletin it is no sign that he will take a book listed , but if he gets a fact from looking at it he has gained something and you lose the bad effect of having him get into the habit of skipping the books on the bulletin , which he usually does . " On the other hand , lists help the systematic reader and relieve the librarian . In closing we will quote a criticism of an eastern librarian , as a thought on which we all need to dwell : " From the artistic point of view such bulletins as I have seen are commonly too scrappy , ill arranged and given too much to detail . One or two pictures on a large card , with a brief descriptive note , all conveying one idea or emphasizing one point only , is the best form . In bulletins , as in many other things , the rule to follow first of all is simplicity . " @# HOW TO INTEREST MOTHERS IN CHILDREN 'S READING @# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mothers who can be interested in the books their children read , although informal , individual work has always been a part of library work with children . This paper was read at the joint meeting of the Michigan and Wisconsin Library Associations in July , 1914 , by Miss May G. Quigley , children 's librarian of the Public Library , Grand Rapids , Michigan . May Genevieve Quigley was born in Grand Rapids , Michigan , and was graduated from the Grand Rapids High School . Soon after this , she began work in the Grand Rapids Public Library and has been Head of the Children 's Department since it was organized in 1907. @# You ask me how to interest mothers in children 's reading . I began by being invited to the different mothers ' meetings held in the schools ; public , parochial and private , the churches and women 's clubs . At each institution , the mothers , coming from widely different circles are always attentive listeners , and many frequently remain to have a word in private , as to whether I consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal opinion about detective stories , or some other subject important to them . I always take with me our Monthly Bulletin , in which are printed the new books for children . This list is talked over with the mothers and books for children of different ages specified . If there is time , I frequently tell the story the book tells or an interesting incident which occurs in some one of the chapters . After such an introduction there is apt to be a " run " on the Children 's department the next few days . Boys and girls come in numbers to ask for the book " You told mother about yesterday . " These talks at the different schools , clubs and churches are the means of bringing the mothers to the library . They are interested now in wishing to see the place where the " fine English books are kept , " as one little foreign mother always says . I find that the foreign-born mothers are intensely alive to the fact that their children must get the English language if they are ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ask intelligent questions as to the books on history and civics for their boys and girls . Birthdays and holidays are also strong factors , by means of which the library can interest the mothers . We have not as yet printed a list of books suitable for birthdays , but we did print a Christmas list in our November Bulletin of last year , and like Mary 's little lamb , this book was with me wherever I went during the Christmas season . It was an exceedingly valuable list , because prices were given . There were books suitable for every taste and every purse . I talked the list over with 250 mothers , whom I met at the various schools . A large number came to the library to see the books before buying . Then too , ways and means are always suggested by which they can obtain additional information , namely the telephone , post card , and by appointment with me at the book store , if they desire it , to say nothing of the many times advice is given outside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibits of books at the schools . This perhaps is the ideal way to interest mothers . I remember at one school the disappointment manifested when it was announced that orders were not taken for the books , but that the same could be obtained at the book store . Our annual Conference on children 's reading , which is held on the first Saturday in May , brings together still another group . The mothers are represented on the program and they take part in the discussion . The subject at these conferences is always some phase of children 's reading . The discussions are interesting and educational , not only for the mothers , but for the library as well . If you are able to speak one or two languages besides English , the way is open for you to the foreign mothers ' clubs . I have frequently been a guest at the Italian mothers ' club , where in a small way I have been able to tell them about the library and the books  --  English and Italian . Not often do these mothers come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their children , and through these useful little citizens I hope some day to see the mothers frequent visitors at the library . I would not have you think that these mothers are not interested because they are not able to come to the library . It is strange and they are often too busy . When I go to the store or they meet me on the street they will ask about the books and express their appreciation of what we are doing for their children . Three-fourths of the mothers , regardless of nationality , social position or education , have no definite idea as to the kind of books their children ought to read . If you would succeed in this movement , be interested , know your books , and be ready to have a human interest in every child 's mother , be she rich or poor , American or foreign born . Success will then attend your efforts . @# REFERENCE WORK AMONG SCHOOL CHILDREN @# The importance of reference work with children is indicated in the next article by the fact that " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those brought by older people , and the material is equally elusive . " Miss Abby L. Sargent contributed this article to the Library Journal for April , 1895 . Abby Ladd Sargent received her training under her sister , Miss Mary E. Sargent . She reorganized the Wilmington Library Association Library in 1890-1891 . From 1891 to 1895 she was librarian of the Middlesex Mechanics Association . In 1895 she became reference librarian and classifier of the Medford Public Library , where her sister was librarian . In 1910 , after her sister 's death , she became librarian of the Medford Public Library . In 1900 she organized and purchased books for the Owatonna , Minnesota , Public Library . She has been instructor in the Expansive Classification in Simmons College Library School since its opening . Miss Sargent was joint editor and compiler of Sargent 's " Reading for the young , " and its supplement . @# Let us suppose that the momentous problem is solved of persuading children to use the library for more serious purpose than to find a book " as good as ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are trying to convince children that the library is infallible , and can furnish information on whatever they wish to know about  --  whether it is some boy who comes on the busiest morning of the week , to find out how to make a puppet show in time to give an afternoon exhibition , or some high-school girl who rushes over in the 20 minutes ' recess to write an exhaustive treatise on women 's colleges . It is unnecessary to say that the fewer books the library can supply the more must those few be forced to yield . A large library , with unlimited volumes , meets few of the difficulties which beset smaller and poorer institutions . If the librarian can name at once " a poem about Henry of Navarre , " or tell who wrote " by the rude bridge that arched the flood , " and on what monument it is engraved , can furnish material for debate on " the Chinese question , " " which city should have the new normal school , " " who was Mother Goose , " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once the confidence of the severest of critics , and is sure of their future patronage . The subjects on which children seek information are as varied as those brought by older people and the material is equally elusive . Perhaps the hardest questions to answer are about the allusions which are found in literature studies , and which frequently the teacher who has given the question can not answer . I find it helpful whenever I come across material of this nature to make a reference to it in the catalog , and , in fact , to analyze carefully all juvenile books , not fiction , whose titles give no hint of the contents . A great many books otherwise valueless become thus most useful , especially if one is pressed for time . Mr. Jones , in his " Special reading lists , " gives many such references to juvenile literature . Books like Ingersoll 's " Country cousins , " which contains an article on shell money , also an account of Professor Agassiz 's laboratory at Newport ; Mary Bamford 's " Talks by queer folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the set of books by Uncle Lawrence , " Young folks ' ideas , " " Queries , " and " Whys and wherefores , " recently republished under the title " Science in story , " and others of this sort , if carefully indexed , answer many of the questions brought every day by children , and amply repay for the trouble . For even if juvenile books are classified on the shelves , much time is wasted in going through many indexes . A wide-awake teacher often gives his pupils the events of the day to study , and if they can not grasp the situation from the daily papers , juvenile periodicals furnish the best material . For this a classified index is indispensable ; it makes available accounts of the workings of government , the weather bureau , mint , and other intangible topics . Until the recent publication of Capt . King 's " Cadet days , " I knew of no other place to find any description of West Point routine outside of Boynton 's or Cullum 's histories . One glimpse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other subject . A short article often suffices to give the main facts . My experience , both as teacher and librarian , persuades me that the average child is eminently statistical . " A horse is an animal with four legs  --  one at each corner , " is fairly representative of the kind of information he seeks . When he becomes diffuse , we may feel sure he has had help . Sissy Jupes are of course to be found , who can not grapple with facts . Working on this principle , I have made liberal use of a book issued by the U. S. Government  --  " The growth of industrial art . " It gives , in pictures , with only a line or two of description , the progress of different industries  --  such as the locomotive , from the clumsy engine of 1802 to the elaborate machinery of the present day ; the evolution of lighting , from the pine-knot and tallow-dip to the electric light ; methods of signalling , from the Indian fire-signal to the telegraph ; time-keeping , etc . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than from a dozen or more pages of description and hard words . If lack of space compels one to deny the privilege of going to the shelves , it seems to me more essential for children to have ready access to reference-books , and especially to be taught how to use them , than for grown-up people . The youngest soon learn to use " Historical notebooks , " Champlin 's Cyclopaedias , Hopkins ' " Experimental science , " " Boys ' and Girls ' handy books , " and others of miscellaneous contents . If they have a mechanical bent they will help themselves from Amateur Work or " Electrical toy-making " ; if musical , from Mrs. Lillie 's " Story of music " or Dole 's " Famous composers " ; if they have ethical subjects to write about , they find what they need in Edith Wiggin 's " Lessons in manners , " Everett 's " Ethics for young people , " or Miss Ryder 's books , which give excellent advice in spite of their objectionable titles . They can find help in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lovell 's " Nature 's wonder workers , " Mrs. Dana 's " How to know the wild flowers , " or turn to Mrs. Bolton 's or Lydia Farmer 's books to learn about famous people , if they are encouraged to do so . These , of course , are only a few of the books which can be used in this way . As the different holidays come round there are frequent applications for the customs of those days , or for appropriate selections for school or festival . Miss Matthews and Miss Ruhl have helped us out in their " Memorial day selections , " and McCaskey 's " Christmas in song , sketch , and story , " and the " Yule-tide collection " give great variety . If the juvenile periodicals do not furnish the customs , they can , of course , be found in Brand 's " Popular antiquities , " or Chambers 's " Book of days . " It is necessary sometimes to use the books for older people , since there is a point where childhood and grown-up-hood meet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knight 's " Mechanical dictionary , " to find out when and where weather-vanes were first used , and to give a grammar-school girl Mrs. Farmer 's " What America owes to women , " for material for a graduating essay . A few excellent suggestions for general reference work are given in Miss Plummer 's " Hints to small libraries " ; but in spite of all the aids at command there come times when our only resource is to follow the adage , " look till you find it and your labor wo n't be lost , " and to accept the advice of Cap'n Cuttle , " When found , make a note on't. " @# REFERENCE WORK WITH CHILDREN @# Another report based on answers received from various libraries in reply to a list of questions suggests that we are " concerned not so much to supply information as to educate in the use of the library . " This report was presented by Miss Harriet H. Stanley at the Waukesha Conference of the A. L. A. in 1901 . Harriet Howard Stanley is a native of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a few years in secondary schools , she entered the New York State Library School , where she was graduated in 1895 . She served for four years as librarian of the Public Library at Southbridge , Mass. , and thereafter was for eleven years school reference librarian in the Public Library of Brookline , Mass . Since 1910 she has had positions in the Library of the U. S. Department of Agriculture and the Providence ( R. I. ) Athenaeum , and was for a year librarian of New Hampshire College . At various times she has taught in summer library schools  --  Albany , India and McGill University . She is now on the staff of the Public Library of Utica , N. Y. @# Preliminary to preparing this report , a list of 15 questions was sent to a number of libraries in different parts of the United States , from 24 of which replies were received . So far as space would permit , the facts and opinions obtained have been embodied in this paper . Reference work with grown people consists in supplying material on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best available matter is furnished with as little cost of time and trouble to the inquirer as is consistent with the service we owe to other patrons of the library . To a certain extent this statement is true also of reference work with children , but I think we are agreed that for them our aim reaches further  - -  reaches to a familiarity with reference tools , to knowing how to hunt down a subject , to being able to use to best advantage the material found . In a word , we are concerned not so much to supply information as to educate in the use of the library . Seventeen of the 24 libraries reporting judge children to be sent to them primarily , if not wholly , for information . One of the first steps towards improving and developing reference work with children will have been taken when the teacher appreciates the larger purpose , since the point of view must materially affect the character and scope of the work . Another forward step is for the library to have definitely in mind some plan for accomplishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likelihood have to be modified to accord with the teacher 's judgment and deeds , but a definite proposal ought at least to give impetus to the undertaking . Six libraries state that a considerable part of the inquiries they receive from children are apparently prompted by their individual interests , and not suggested by the teacher . These inquiries relate chiefly to sports , mechanical occupations and pets . This paper is confined to the discussion of reference work connected with the schools . @# LIBRARY FACILITIES @# In selecting reference books for the purpose , certain familiar ones come at once to our minds . Beyond those there have been suggested : Chase and Clow 's " Stories of Industry , " " Information readers , " Brown 's " Manual of commerce , " Boyd 's " Triumphs and wonders of the 19th century , " Patton 's " Resources of the United States , " Geographical readers , Youth 's Companion geographical series , Spofford 's " Library of historic characters , " Larned 's " History for ready reference , " Ellis 's " Youth 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and great inventors , " Baldwin 's " Fifty famous stories , " " Riverside natural history , " Wright 's " Seaside and wayside , " bound volumes of the Great Round World , and text-books on various subjects . A dictionary catalog will be useful in teaching the child to look up subjects for himself . If a separate catalog is provided for children , the question arises whether it is wiser to follow closely the A. L. A. headings or to modify them where they differ from topics commonly asked for by children or used as headings in text-books . This question suggests also the advisability of a modified classification for a children 's library . Last and not least , children should have room and service adapted to their needs , so that they may not constantly have to be put aside in deference to the rightful demands of adult readers . So far as the writer knows , the Public Library of Boston was the first library to open a reference room expressly for children , well equipped and separate from the children 's reading room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for adults . @# CHOICE OF TOPICS @# Many libraries report that they find the topics habitually well chosen . The gist of the criticisms is as follows : ( a ) The teacher should make clear to the child just what he is to look up and how to ask for it . An eastern library furnishes this incident : " I want a book about flowers . " " Do you want a special flower ? " " Yes , I want the rose . " A book on the cultivation of roses is handed her . Her companion , looking over , exclaims , " Why she wants the Wars of the roses ! " The same librarian was invited to provide something on American privileges ; whether social , religious , political , or otherwise , the child did not know . ( b ) The teacher should be reasonably sure that there is on the topic something in print , in usable shape , that can be gotten at with a reasonable amount of labor . ( c ) The subject when found should be within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfit for children , since grasses are difficult to study , and the description of them in encyclopedias and botanies is too technical . An eight- year-old had to investigate the Abyssinian war . Pupils under 16 were assigned the topic Syncretism in the later pagan movement . A western librarian was asked by some girls for Kipling 's " Many inventions " and " Day 's work . " Both were out . " Well , what other books of Kipling 's on agriculture have you ? " " Why , Kipling has n't written any books on agriculture ; he writes stories and poems . " " But we have to debate on whether agriculture or manufacturing has done more for the welfare of the country , and we want a book on both sides . " ( d ) The topic should be definite and not too broad , and should be subdivided when necessary . The briefest comprehensive description of Rome is probably that in Champlin 's " Persons and places , " where the six columns , already much condensed , would take more than an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out about Italian painters . None of the several encyclopedias treated them collectively under either Italy or Art . Mrs. Bolton 's book of 10 artists includes four Italians , but it takes some time and skill to discover them , as the fact of their nationality does not introduce the narrative . How should a sixth grade pupil make a selection from the 60 painters in Mrs. Jameson 's book ? Three names were furnished by the librarian , and the child made notes from their biographies . The next day she returned and said she had n't enough artists . ( e ) The question should preferably be of such nature that the child can be helped to find it rather than be obliged to wait while the librarian does the work . One inquiry was , " What eastern plant is sometimes sold for its weight in gold ? " This is not in the book of " Curious questions . " ( f ) The topic should be worth spending time upon . The genealogy of Ellen Douglas will hardly linger long in the average memory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suppose the topic to be good and suitable material to have been found ; for older children there are two good ways of using it  --  one to read through and make notes on the substance , the other to copy in selection . Children need practice in doing both . The first method suits broad description and narration , the second detailed description . There seems to be a prevailing tendency to copy simply , without sufficient neglect of minor points , a process which should be left to the youngest children , since it furnishes little mental training , uses a great deal of time , keeps the writer needlessly indoors , and fosters habits of inattention , because it is easy to copy with one 's mind elsewhere . The necessity for using judgment after the article has been found is illustrated by the case of some children who came for the life of Homer . Champlin , in about a column , mentions the limits within which the conjectures as to the time of Homer 's birth lie , the places which claim to be his birthplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The children , provided with the book , plunged at once into copying until persuaded just to read the column through . " When you finish reading , " I said , " come to me and tell me what it says . " They came and recounted the items , and only after questioning did they at all grasp the gist of the matter , that nothing is known about Homer . Even then their sense of responsibility to produce something tangible was so great that they would copy the details , and from the children who came next day I judged that the teacher had required some facts as to time and place and tradition . While it is true that we learn by doing and it is well that children should rely upon themselves , it is evident that young pupils need some direction . Even when provided with sub-topics , they often need help in selecting and fitting together the appropriate facts , since no article exactly suits their needs . About half of the reporting librarians are of the opinion that it is the teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they consider the library to have done its share when the child has been helped to find the material . The other half believe such direction as is suggested above to be rightly within the librarian 's province ; several , however , who express a willingness to give such help , add that under their present library conditions it is impracticable . We can easily see that time would not permit nor would it be otherwise feasible for the teacher to examine every collection of notes made at the library , but there ought to be some systematic work where the topics are thoughtfully chosen , the librarian informed of them in advance , and the notes criticised . A moderate amount of reference work so conducted would be of greater benefit than a large quantity of the random sort which we now commonly have . Five librarians state that they are usually given the topics beforehand . Several others are provided with courses of study or attend grade meetings in which the course is discussed . @# SYSTEMATIC INSTRUCTION IN THE USE OF THE LIBRARY @# While a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a few libraries report any systematic lessons . In Providence each visiting class is given a short description of books of reference . In Hartford an attempt at instruction was made following the vacation book talks . In Springfield , Mass. , last year the senior class of the literature department was given a lesson on the use of the library , followed by two practice questions on the card catalog . In one of the Cleveland branches talks are given to both teachers and pupils . At the Central High School of Detroit the school librarian has for the past three years met the new pupils for 40 minutes ' instruction , and test questions are given . A detailed account of similar work done in other high school libraries is to be found in the proceedings of the Chautauqua conference . Cambridge has given a lecture to a class or classes of the Latin school . In the current library report of Cedar Rapids , Ia. , is outlined in detail a course of 12 lessons on bookmaking , the card catalog , and reference books . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each grade of the schools , from the fifth to the eighth , has the use of our class room for an afternoon session each month . Each child is assigned a topic on which to write a short composition or give a brief oral report . When a pupil has found all he can from one source , books are exchanged , and thus each child comes into contact with several books . At these monthly library afternoons I give short talks to the pupils on the use of the library , the reference books , and the card catalog , accompanied by practical object lessons and tests . " At Brookline our plan is to have each class of the eighth and ninth grades come once a year to our school reference room at the library . The teacher accompanies them , and they come in school hours . The school reference librarian gives the lesson . For the eighth grade we consider the make-up of the book  --  the title-page in detail , the importance of noting the author , the significance of place and date and copyright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contents and index . This is followed by a description of bookmaking , folding , sewing and binding , illustrated by books pulled to pieces for the purpose . The lesson closes with remarks on the care of books . The ninth grade lesson is on reference books , and is conducted largely by means of questioning . A set of test questions at the end emphasizes the description of the books . In these lessons the pupils have shown an unexpected degree of interest and responsiveness . The course brought about 400 children to the library , a few of whom had never been there before . These were escorted about a little , and shown the catalog , charging desk , bulletins , new book shelves , etc . Every one not already holding a card was given an opportunity to sign a registration slip . The following year the eighth grade , having become the ninth , has the second lesson . With these lessons the attitude of the children towards the library has visibly improved , and we are confident that their idea of its use has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of the reporting libraries whether any bibliographical work was being done by the high school . The question was not well put , and was sometimes misunderstood . Almost no such work was reported . At Evanston , III. , one high school teacher has taught her class to prepare bibliographies , the librarian assisting . At Brookline we have ambitions , not yet realized , of getting each high school class to prepare one bibliography a year ( we begin modestly ) on some subject along their lines of study . Last May the principals of two grammar schools offered to try their ninth grades on a simple bibliography . The school reference librarian selected some 60 topics of English history  --  Bretwalda , Sir Isaac Newton , East India Company , the Great Commoner , etc . Each bibliography was to include every reference by author , title and page to be found in the books of the school reference collection of the public library . The pupils displayed no little zest and enjoyment in the undertaking , and some creditable lists were made . Observation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pupils became more keen and more thorough than in the usual getting of material from one or two references on a subject . Such training will smooth the way and save the time of those students who are to make use of a college library , and is even more to be desired for those others whose formal education ends with the high or grammar schools . The practice of sending collections of books from the public library to the schools is becoming general . When these collections are along the lines of subjects studied , it would seem as if the reference use of the library by pupils might be somewhat diminished thereby . No doubt it is a convenience to both teacher and pupils to have books at hand to which to refer . The possession of an independent school library also tends to keep the reference work in the school . But in neither case ought the reference use of the public library or its branches to be wholly or materially overlooked , since it is on that that pupils must depend in after years , and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the people of modest means need the library . As for the very-well-to-do , the library needs them . Other things being equal , the pupil who has learned to know and to know how to use his public library ought later so to appreciate its needs and so to recognize the benefits it bestows that he will be concerned to have it generously supported and wisely administered . Even we librarians claim for our public collection no such fine service as is rendered by those private treasures that stand on a person 's own shelves , round which " our pastime and our happiness will grow . " Books for casual entertainment are more and more easily come by . But so far as our imagination reaches , what private library will for most readers supplant a public collection of books for purposes of study and reference ? Is it not then fitting that we spend time and effort to educate young people to the use of the public library ? Do not the methods for realizing this end seem to be as deserving of systematic study as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to bring school authorities to our assistance our faith must be sufficient to convince and our patience must be tempered by a kindly appreciation of the large demands already made upon the schools . Have we not yet to learn by just what lessons and what practice work the reference use of the public library can best be taught to children ? @# INSTRUCTION OF SCHOOL CHILDREN IN THE USE OF LIBRARY CATALOGS AND REFERENCE BOOKS @# The necessity of close cooperation between school and library in the practical use of books as tools in order that we may have " our grown people more appreciative of the value of their public library and better able to use it " is clearly brought out in this article written by Miss Elizabeth Ellis , Peoria Public Library , for Public Libraries , July , 1899 . Miss Ellis says : " It was written at a time when we had no children 's department and was an account of my pioneer efforts made entirely as a side issue from my own work as general reference librarian . " Elizabeth Ellis spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later taking three months of special work . With the exception of organizing a library at Wenona , Illinois , her work was with the Peoria Public Library . She is not now in library work . @# Since the public school of today is the source from which must come our support tomorrow , it behooves us to give some attention to the proper training of our school children if we would have our grown people more appreciative of the value of their public library and better able to use it . We can not begin too early , and if the children fall into line there will be no trouble with the coming generation . But they must learn to really use the library ; to feel that they are standing on their own feet and using their own tools , not merely that there is a pleasant room where a good story may be had for the asking . They must grow up in such familiar use of the library in all its departments that it will come to be an actual necessity to them in the pursuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical culture teachers for our schools ; may we not have a few lessons in how to use a library to the best advantage as part of the course ? This field for instruction may be worked to advantage by the librarian , with comparatively little expenditure of time after the first round has been made . Teachers often feel that they have themselves already more outside work than they can accomplish , but they are really glad to have this instruction given in their schools , and in our experience they have invariably taken great interest in it and have done all in their power to further our efforts . There is certainly no library work which sends in its returns more promptly , for children feel an instinctive sense of ownership in their library , and take a personal interest in anything pertaining to it . They give the most flattering attention and put their instructions into immediate practice . I believe they really take more interest in the subject when presented by " a lady from the library " than if it were only an additional school lesson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction must come in the grammar grades and high school , but it is well to begin as early as the third year , and possibly with the second , if there are found to be many children in a room who have already begun to take books and if there is no age limit . If it should so chance that only a small number in a room are library members , it is better to give only the general interesting library talk , leaving the specific instruction till a second visit , when the fruits of the first will probably appear . There is one point for the lowest room which it may be well to mention . See to it that they are learning to say their A B C 's in the good old-fashioned way , for upon this depends all familiar use of catalogs and indexes . Any child who can write can fill out a call slip , and this we teach them to do from the very first , either from a catalog when help in selection must be given , or from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be impressed upon them that if they do not understand the general instruction you are always ready and glad to explain further . If they feel that you are really interested , even the smallest ones will work with enthusiasm to prepare their own call slips instead of asking each time for just any good book . The intermediate grades , the fifth and sixth , and sometimes the fourth , are quite able to understand the general catalog . I should not advise much explanation at the school , at least in these grades , of the card catalog , if the library has a printed list . The use of a classed catalog , with its index , is easily comprehended , and there are many whole classes of books which these children will enjoy knowing about ; boys , I should say , perhaps , for it is the pages containing electricity , photography , boat-building , and hunting , which are worn and crumpled . It is the classed catalog which they will use most , but they should understand the difference between it and the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give quizzes , even on a first visit , to draw the children out . Those who are already patrons of the library are delighted to show their knowledge . Afterwards it would be well before the day of the visit , with the teacher 's consent , to send a short set of questions which would be answered and returned for correction , thus giving you an idea of what points need dwelling upon . These questions would vary from the simplest points in filling out library numbers , giving authors to titles and vice versa , to questions on arrangement , use of dictionary catalog and of various reference books . In upper grades and high school add a simple explanation of the card catalog as being the most complete record , trusting to their interest in coming to the library to use it practically . If there is no printed catalog this explanation will have to be given to fifth and sixth years also . They should be advised to use both kinds , and particularly the dictionary catalog for biography , as the short analytical references @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again particularly , take to the card catalog with a confidence often lacking in their elders . I have seen them even make out their fiction lists from the cards in preference to the printed catalog , though for what reason I can not explain , unless it is their innate desire to explore the unknown . It is a good plan to have sample cards plainly written in large form on a sheet of paper , in addition to using a section of the catalog itself if it seems advisable to take it . In lower rooms a blackboard talk holds the attention better . The use of the guide card , which misleads so many grown people , the heading in red , and the see and see also cards in the dictionary catalog , and the arrangement of biography in a classed list are a few points , which may need dwelling upon , and which I mention as having been found in our experience to be pitfalls for the unwary . In the upper grade rooms , and particularly in the high school , comes the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it hard to hold the attention of sixth-year pupils in this part , but they ought to be familiar with a good encyclopedia and biographical dictionary , and the gazeteer . Tell them about Harper 's Book of facts , Hayden 's Dictionary of dates , the Century and Lippincott reference books and so on ; also Chambers ' Book of days , and the mythological dictionaries , in addition to the best encyclopedias , leaving at each school a descriptive list of these books for their further use . Call especial attention to the biographical dictionaries  --  few persons know how to use a set whose index is in the last volume ; also note difference between table of contents and index in general books , and accustom them to use the latter . If there is a very large reference room it might be well to have some of the best books for school use collected on one shelf , and of course every children 's room should be thus supplied . Poole 's index may be explained for the principle , but practically people are so sure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well to use a little discretion with regard to it , unless you have made an index of all your own periodicals which are included in Poole , and can induce children to be patient enough to use it as a key to the other . The Cumulative index is rather better to teach them the use of periodicals , since it does not contain so many , and also as it gives such a very good idea of the dictionary catalog . The back numbers can be used in your explanations in the schoolroom for both purposes . Find out whether there is a debating society , and if so bring out Briefs for debate , Pros and cons , and tell them specially about the periodical indexes for late subjects . Care must be taken not to crowd too much into one lesson , or to make it too technical ; this latter point we must specially guard against , and experience in teaching comes into good use here . Their individual work with these books will have to be overlooked for some time , even though they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fly to the rescue and lend a helping hand without a special request , which I have found some children too timid to make . In the first year of this kind of work the grammar grades and high school would need some of the instruction given in the lower grades , and after the system is really in working order there would be no actual need to go beyond the grammar grade , as the aim should be to have all really necessary instruction given then as so large a majority of pupils never go farther ; but in the high school , if advisable , a course in bibliography could be introduced , based on their school work . The use of the reference room , or reference desk , is a thing to be taught as much as the books themselves , and in this matter those libraries in which there is not an entirely separate children 's room may have an advantage . I am told that there is a certain feeling of timidity in entering a reference room which is sometimes hard to overcome in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arrangement , they must be made to feel that the reference room , its appliances and its attendants , are part of their school outfit , an annex to the school as it were , however much we , carrying out the idea of Dr. Harris , may think the school an annex to the library . Accustom them as far as possible to use reference books at the library , and perhaps the coming generation will not invariably demand a book to take home , no matter how small the subject or how large the number of applicants for the same . In this , as in all other school work , we must look to the teacher for aid after the technical use of our tools is taught . The average child does not so much need the encouragement to read which may come from the library as constant guidance , which , to a large degree , must and does rest with the teacher , and in this matter of instruction much must depend on her even though the teaching itself is not imposed upon her as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , get her individual interest , and I can testify that she will assist in many ways . Children take their tone from their teacher , and the battle is half won if we have her hearty cooperation . A catalog should be placed in every school , and this she will help her pupils to use in nature work , history , and geography , and at the different holidays ; also for their selections in speaking . Particularly can she help in regard to their use of the reference room . She will remind them from time to time to go there instead of to the general delivery counter for special school topics . She will furnish a weekly memorandum of her essay work , this especially in//
