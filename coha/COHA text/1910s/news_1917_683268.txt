txt The Federal Trade Commission may not find it necessary to redeem its promise to complete its inquirY into the coal trade . The Commission made hold to say just what the trade needed to make it 100 per cent . efficient . It is impossible to say that the publication was premature when its mere appearance in print so nearly coincided with the practical application of efficiency methods . Within a single day after the Commission 's report the Railroad War Board announces that the soft coal trade will be " pooled " just like the hard coal trade . All tidewater coal will be put into a common supply , very much as grain is put into an elevator , and customers will be supplied out of the " pool . " The Railroad War Board might have hesitated to use so obnoxious a word or method except for the encouragement of the Federal Trade Commission 's report , which had held up the anthracite trade as an example of efficiency . It found that there was little trouble , comparatively . In the anthracite trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between rail trans " portation and anthracite production , " ordinarily called a trust and obnoxious to all reformers bemuse it enabled the roads to mine the commodity which they transported . The disfavor with which Congress and the Department of Justice had viewed that arrangement is only one reason why the bituminous trade was not similarly organized . The particular reason is that there is bituminous coal almost anywhere . and much of it can he mined by a strong man with a pick . It is a sprawling industry . compared with the anthracite trade , as appears from the fart that eighty-two railways are in the bituminous pool . There have been over a thousand grades and sorts of soft coal ; there will be but forty-one . The economy of this method will be such that the War Board expects an economy of 133,000 freight cars and an addition of over six million tons to last year 's 31.000,000 . Such precision is encouraging , compared with the Trade Commission 's discovery of a shortage from a " possible maximum . " Even with all its drawbacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hard coal " trust . " The War Board 's statement , published yesterday , says : According to Government figures now at hand , the 82 principal bituminous coal carrying railroads in May , 1917. hauled 142.157 more carloads of coal ? approximately 7,100.000 tons ? than they did in May , 1916 . This was an Increase of 23 . S per cent . The railroads hauled 739.674 carloads of bituminous coal in May of this year , compared with 597,517 cars in May , 1916 . That is not a bad record of performance by a " paralyzed " trade which was " paralyzing " the industries of the country . Yet this does not exhaust the ironies of the coal situation . . Aircording to yesterday 's court reports , a soft coal conspirator testified that he had bought 250,000 tons of coal , at prices ranging up to $5 , to deliver upon his contracts to furnish coal at $1.125 . Where did . he get it ? From the " independents . " Their virtue prevents their joining a conspiracy to raise prices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers for their coal . The situation is similar in the hard or domestic coal trade . The independents are supplying the coal which Is sold at extortionate prices , while the trust is supplying Its regular customers at lower prices , although the trust 's quantities leave something to be desired . The trust 's prices are the minimum aboveS which the independents take all they can get . If there were a monopoly in the trade there would be somebody to hold responsible . But the coal prices are soaring as the oil prices did after the Oil Trust was dissolved . Now the Trade Commission proposes a trust of trusts . There never was such a " combine " ? as that of all railways , steamships , and coal mines . Is the Trade Commission against the trusts , or in favor of the trusts ? What is the Government 's position ? Are trusts all right when the Government is the trust ? Is the " fixing " of prices all right when the . Government is the fixer end wraft when done otherwise ? After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where will it get the goods it needs , unless the prices fixed are satisfactory to the producer ? After the Government commandeers the producers ' plants in the manner recommended by the Trade Commission , will it commandeer the labor necessary to work the plants ? And will it commandeer the food necessary to feed the laborers who work in the plants ? After the Government Is everything , who will be left outside to take the Government 's ' orders ? On the whole , are not soft words and methods better than those which might lead the Government into a morass of blunders ? Surely there is a safe middle ground between the anarchy of Russia , which so lately seemed to be ruled by its workmen , and the autocracy of Germany , ruled by COWS vicegerent . The ' Government has better advisers in the bustnese men and patriotic leaders of labor at its command than in its commissions and lawmakers and prosecutors . They will never produce anything but confusion of counsel . The Captains of Industry and the Captains of Labor by their agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
