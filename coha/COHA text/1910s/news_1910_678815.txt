txt With the congratulations of Bishop Greer , of scores of his fellow-clergymen , and of every member of his own large congregation , the Rev. Dr. John Floyd Steen celebrated yesterday the fortieth anniversary of his rectorship at the Ascension Memorial Church , in West Fortythird Street . The clergyman was born in this city sixty-eight years ago . Dr. Steen went to his present west side Episcopal parish on Feb. 1 , 1870 , when Times Square was wholly a residential section , when West Forty-second Street was known as " Doetors ' Row , " and when the Ascension Memorial Church itself was a small brick Gothic structure , between Eighth and Ninth Avenues . " There were only fifty in the congregation then , " said Dr. Steen yesterday . " The church was a subsidiary of the Ascension Church in the Fifth Avenue section . There had been some dissension , and we had to re-establish the parish from a very small beginning . I was only 28 years old , and had been for several years assistant to Stephen Tyng , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Holy Trinity , at Madison Avenue and Forty-second Street , every Sunday with the city 's fashionable folk . " My new parish , when I took it up , was small . But it was picturesque and in a way beautiful . Shade trees lined the curbs of what has now come to be the theatre district , and there were many fine old frame buildings , with old-fashioned columns . The church became independent and moved to the present building sixteen years ago , in Forty-third Street , between Seventh and Eighth Avenues . Jefferson Clarke , the lawyer , and the family of George A. Hearn , the dry goods merchant , helped me to raise $20,000 for the purpose . " In honor of its rector , the church at yesterday morning 's service was crowded to the doors . A class of thirty communicants was confirmed by Bishop Greer . The Bishop , who also preached the sermon , took for his text the passage in St. Paul 's second epistle to Timothy , ii. , 8 : " Remember Jesus ' Christ , raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Bishop Greer , " is a great factor in molding a man 's manners and morals . It is a great spiritual storehouse , on which each man must of necessity draw for much of his moral and spiritual support . If vur memoiies are full of good thoughts , good examples , and good deeds , they help to support us all through life . " That is the great value of a Christian life . The mere going to church and the saying of prayers are only a means to an end The vital thing is the living of a Christian life because of the store of sweet and gracious thoughts with which it fills the memory . What people want nowadays is a rule for their daily . life . So mans suggestions are being offered every day in books , magazines , and newspapers that it seems almost impossible to formulate a definite rule of daily life . But the real rule is St. Paul 's .

Something in each one of its is constantly searching , seeking . It is the soul in each one of us that is searching , searching all the timb ; and each soul , in its own way , is trying to find God Almighty . " Both before and after the service Dr. Steen held a reception in the church 's entrance and in the vestry room . Mrs. George A. Hearn , Jefferson Clarke , and Stephen Tyng , Jr. , supporters of the church , were present , as well as D. F. Renne , Dr. John Dewitt Nelson , David J. Gordon , Franklin B. Seidel , Richard W. Baker , and other of the church 's Trustees and Vestry . Daniel Thom , 88 years of age , walked over from his home to the church . He was a member of the congregation before Dr. Steen took charge , and was greeted by the minister as  --  the oldest parishioner .
