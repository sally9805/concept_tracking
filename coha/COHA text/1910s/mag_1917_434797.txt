WE had planned it for two years now , a cart journey over the frozen Yalu . The first winter it was so bitter cold t hat no foreigner could risk it . It is now February of the second year . With a succession of freezes and thaws , the rivers in Southern Manchuria have not yet become safe for cart travel . It looks as if we should have to give it up again , for the partial trails in the virgin forest arc scarcely passable unless frozen . Here 's to the luck of the roamer ! We have had a week of continued cold weather and at last the Yalu has frozen over . They say that , if we start immediately , we can finish the river part of our journey before the ice breaks . The Yalu forms the eastern boundary of Manchuria , with Korea lying just across . The great river winds and winds for about two hundred miles , then divides , one branch following the Korean shore , one the Manchurian . In between these branches is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mainland , separated from her own by these bridgeless tributaries . higher up , the branches dwindle to thin streams , and Manchuria again becomes one . But as this takes place in the impenetrable land near the Long White Mountain , the lonely inhabitants of the triangle must depend upon the winter ice and summer junks for outside communication . This leaves an in-between time of thin or floating ice . As my husband 's business takes its some two hundred miles up the eastern sideof the triangle , to a big lumbering town , and then across a wide stretch of country full of ranges of mountains covered with forests , t he danger is t hat we may be caught in this veritable island at the time of its isolation . Here 's to the dear kind gods who look after wanderers ! We shall trust them not to block our path with h floatitig cakes of ice , leaving us , like Crusoe , on a separate portion of the earth . Such a journey ! It would rejoice the heart of any vagabond . Days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and part Tally tilled hills of the lower reaches of the river . Then a plunge into t hat isolated triangular-shaped treasure-land , a far-off country full of hidden coal , copper , and gold , stretches and stretches of glorious timber and ? bandits and wild animals ! It is the country holding the Chinese pot of gold at the end of China 's rainbow . From confiscated Korea the Japanese follow this rainbow with hungry eyes . But to the white world , this part of Manchuria along the Yalu is almost unknown . Younglutsband and a couple of comrades spent a year 's furlough there in 1888 . Since then this inaccessible wilderness of wealth has been left almost to itself , so far as the occidental explorer is concerned , only now and then a business man venturing into its wild , unsettled regions . Some ten years ago It picturesque Englishman , famed all over itIanchuria for his erratic doings , went through it hunting a gold mine , the concession papers for which he made out himself , and they were 211 afterwards proved fraudulent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating in the Orient have sent a white man through . There are also rumors of a sea-pilot and his wife who , long ago , went by native boat for a holiday part way up the river , But never before had a woman gone over the whole of this territory , or attempted any of it in the winter . It 's pack and go . We have just been down to the foreign store of the little port where we live . It closely resembles a country store at a four-corners in America . A Gobi dust-storm ? veritable brown blizzard ? had blown up , but donning dust-goggles and great coats , we ventured forth . What cared we ? In a few hours , we will once more be together on the trail ? a new one , an untried one . Once more , out came the rough clothes of the road . Not a feminine gannet It went into that chest . I could have hugged for very joy the good stout shoes , the breeches , and rough jacket .. They meant for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of its buoyant gayety . We caught the night express for Antung , the great port of the Yalu . The train pulled slowly out into the blizzard and the night , slipping past deserted Russian barracks , eloquent of the great Russian advance ; here and there the Russian cemeteries spoke all too eloquently of the later retreat . On that Buddhist plain , many clays from the frontier , the Greek crosses of the huddled graves looked lonely and exiled . In time Mukden was gone and the monotonous prairies. ( lose against the cold window-pane I pressed my face , straining my eyes into the blizzard for one glimpse of the eternal hills . ' Hurry , hurry , fire-cartl the trail , the trail under the open sky , the trail among the hills , is just ahead . ' And then I went to sleep and slept until we pulled into Antung in the early morning . All I he next day we were busy . First , there were the carts to get ? one for ourselves and one for those indispensable factors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on these , for We knew by experience that it . would be an all-clay job to complete the Orient al bargaining . The carters must , of course , start far in excess of the fair price , and we far below . Then , by night , without either of its ' losing face , ' we would reach an in-between price ; the middle-man , and the carters , and the boy , and various other hangers-on would have carefully arranged the little matter of squeeze ' attendant upon the transaction . Has it been said , ' There is six feet of ground awaiting the 11111I1 who tries to hustle the East ' ? Let it also be said that the six feet await him even sooner should he seek to eliminate squeeze . ' The list of the clothes we are to wear is appalling : two suits of flannel underwear each , flannel shirts , fur-lined trousers , sweaters , short leather fur-lined coats , heavy shoes , and then the final layer ? sheepskin coats with t he wool so thick we can scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over our big shoes . Our greatest asset is our boy . Ile lived in Harbin during the winter of the plague ; he was one of the retinue of the picturesque Englishman when he went hunting the gold mine . He has been a carpenter , a farmer , a coolie , a boy , and a boatman . He changes his role as easily as the chameleon its color . In times of stress on the road , such flexibility is salvation . Thus attired , thus equipped , on the twenty-first of February we left Antung ? the last place we were to see for many a day that had even the first prerequisites of civilized comforts . ' It is good to cast them all away , ' ? so sang our hearts as at six o'clock in the morning , in blackest darkness , we stepped from theoverheated hotel into thequiet cold , just before dawn . Our two carts , covered with heavy blue cloth and lined with furs , stood ready at the door ; the carters moved around , giving a last greasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold a month 's rations , were roped on the back ; then came the clothes chest , also roped on . The heckling-roll was put in the back of the cart . Last of all , on top of the grain sacks of our last journey , we stuffed in a thin mattress which we were to use on the k'angs 1 at nighttime . This mattress was our latest do-vice for making endurable the jolting of the oaken cart-bodes which sit , with no gentle intermediary of springs , directly on a solid oak axle . I had grown to twice my usual size in my layers of clothes , and the cart , with its furs and mattress , seemed to have shriveled ; but , by dint of much pushing by my husband and much pulling on my own part , I managed to crawl in . My husband jumped to his usual place across from the driver ; the boy and the middle-man were already in the cart behind ; the ' escort , ' consisting of one soldier , walked ahead . Somewhere from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we heard the tau-tzu , the equivalent of the Yankee ' gid-dap . ' We were off , rumbling over the snow-covered streets of Antung ! Turning once and then again , we had left Antung behind . In another half hour we had reached the frozen river where lay the trail of the winter . II I have surely sipped some potion meant for gypsies ; for as soon as we were in that bumpy cart , with the surety of days afield , my spirit took on a serenity peculiar to our wandering days . By the time we had reached the river , the knack of riding in a Peking cart had come back to me , and I snuggled down into my furs . ' Happy ? ' asked my husband . I sighed contentedly . The front of the cart , with its fur curtain rolled up , was a window , arched at the top , framing for me the pageant of the winter frontier-land . On either side were the white hills , over our heads was the gray sky , before us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizon , there snaked along , now on one side , now on the other , a dark streak . Thus had the winter road been blazed out to avoid thin ice , and rapids where the water flowed too fast to freeze . Tinkle , tinkle went the tiny hell 011 the shaft-mule ; click , clack went the cart as the mules trotted briskly over one of the very few good roads a Chinese mule ever sees . The sun came over the mountain-tops , touching that deathlike gray world with an elfin touch , transforming it into a shimmering glory . In that radiant morning , over the sparkling ice and snow moved the peasants , bent on business , bent on pleasure , rejoicing with the married children , mourning for the dead . Black spots advanced out of a shining haze , grew large , took on shape . ' I see trees as men walking , ' said I laughing . ' ' ' hey are Koreans , ' said my husband . They were all in white , with their billy-cock hats perched rakishly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance there emerged great produce-carts pulled by long lines of mules , with dark hooded figures huddled on the top of the load . Foot-travelers came along , sombrely clad , bent low under the loads on their backs . Slog , slog , t hey moved past us . There were sledges drawn by the family ox . 13y the ox 's side plodded the man of the family ; on the sledges , wrapped in padded blankets , sat gay little ladies , jewels in their glossy hair . It'rom the blankets peeped bright-eyed babies , their cheeks red with cold and daubs of paint . Now that the crops were harvested they were all going visiting . By and by there came a funeral procession , a startling splash of color . NIusicians in Lincoln green carried great gold-colored instruments . Faint fragments of the dirge , now high wailing , now deep groaning , reached us , grew louder , shrieked in our ears , and passed . The procession followed ? a long line of muffled black figures carrying the paper paraphernalia of the dead : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large as the real ones passing , tall phantom servants , and gay paper-doll ladies riding large birds of luck , looking as witchlike as Mother Goose on her broomstick sweeping the sky . Pace , pace from the ! milk above , came the great , ( tat afalque in a clinging mantle of red , borne aloft by beggars gathered in at . random , I heir rags flapping bizarrely below their hastily donned garments of state . In sackcloth walked the mourners . The little padded driver drowsed . The right-hand mule , resembling the famous Modes tine , tried to take every snowy by-path , shied at . every familiar and unfamiliar object . But we were very gay and light-hearted and never minded anything ? , just watched the peasant world file past us . ' Hey ! ' cried my husband , as that wicked white mule gave an extra jump , wake up here , Schnicklepenutz , and tend these mules . ' He 's not a German , he 's got a queue , ' I protested . I ca n't , help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Schnicklepenutz he shall be , ' shouted my husband front over the top of his fur collar . So Schnicklepenutz he remained to the end of the chapter , and drowsed as well under that name as under any other . ' And Benoni shall be the name of the driver of the other cart , ' my husband continued ; I feel that he is marked for tragedy . ' Far into the evening we rode under the pale rays of the 1110011 . We were go-Mg to do a splendid day'swork ? a hundred and twenty ( forty miles ) . The road was good , the mules were fresh , and we unconscious of our cart-bruises , because we had not as yet slept on them . Somewhere about nine o'clock we drove our mules up the bank into the street , of the first town from Antung . The street was dark and empty , for the curfew rings up here at eight o'clock . All the shutters were closed ; the three or four iron bars of each door were slid into place . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descended and hammered on the door until sonic one within shouted through the cracks , asking who we were . ' Kai arum , kai anon ! ' ( Open your doors , open your doors ! ) ' We are from Antung . We have business with you . ' ' Wait , wait ! ' they cried , ' we must ask the head-man . ' More questions from within , more waiting . Then the bars were slid back , and we were received with Eastern politeness , served with tea as we warmed our hands over a charcoal brazier , and then given a warm k'ang in an inner room . All me ! the change in our spirits in twenty-four hours ! All we desired the next morning when we woke , was to be left . in peace on the warm lang . We were so stiff and sore that we did not like to think of carts . But unfortunately our business was soon done . We had only one difficulty with the shop-owner . Some time before , he had been sent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rankest extravagance to expose such beautiful things to the elements , he had carefully wrapped them up and put them away . When this matter had been arranged to our satisfaction and his disapproval , we had only to break bread with our host and we were again on our way . There was a north wind and it was snowing ? great heavy flakes . The river had become a stranger . We were speechless , enthralled , unable to take our eyes from so wildly compelling a thing . The heaps of snow looked vague and unnatural ; the piles of ice took on eerie shapes . At four , in a snowy twilight , we saw the sign of an inn ? the hoops of red cloth , nothing but a dark scarecrow dangling from a long pole stuck in the snow on the high bank above us . Trusting that the swinging rags told t he truth , ? for the bank hid any sign of the inn itself , ? we ordered the carters to drive up the track . With the last strain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inn courtyard , with its hastily built brushwood fence , the dead leaves still clinging . The building was a long , one-storied mud hut , with thatched roof . We entered . Behold what the frontiersman had created ! The long room was the scene of homely industry . From the centre rafter hung a big oil-lamp , shedding its rays over a patriarchal family as busy as a hive of bees . By the clay stove sat the grandfather feeding the fire with twigs , and tending a brood of children playing on a dirt floor packed hard , swept clean . Front one corner came the merry whir of grinding mill-stones , as a blindfolded donkey walked round and round , while a woman in red with a wonderful headdress gathered up the heaps of yellow cornmeal that oozed from the gray stones . More women in red threw the bright meal high in the air , winnowing it of its chaff ; others leaned over clay mortars , pounding condiments with stone pestles . Men were hurrying here and there with firewood , cooking for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these wayfarers , but the k'ang at the other end was divided into sections . From each rafter over earls section swung quaint little cradles ; in each cradle was a little brown baby , earls baby tended by a larger child . Far away front the loud clamor of the western world , we fell asleep in a clean inner room , to the soft sound of swinging cradles and grinding mill-stones . ? III Six days , and We first stage of our journey is over . We have reached the town standing just where the river branches . To-morrow we start up the right arm of the triangle , cutting ourselves off front the mainland . The shopkeepers with whom we arc staying have given us a k'ang in the cake-kitchen . In a niche above the ovens sits the kitchen god . It is evening now , and a little scullery-boy is making the rounds of all the gods . Be has just offered incense and chin-chinned to the kitchen 's guardian angel . I wonder if he looks after vagabonds also ? if they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . seemed the dead of night , so black it was , with only the tiny points of light from the incense glowing in the room . My husband was calling , ' Wake up , wake up , thou sleepy head ; ' t is time to burn our bridges . ' Then the boy entered and stuck a lighted candle in some melted wax on the Pang table . The stage was set for our plunge into the country that might become isolated . Despite our early rising it was mid- forenoon before we left . The boy had been warned in a dream of bandits , and it caused a grave discussion ; all the owners of the shop stopped work to take part in it The upshot . of it was that . the yamen doubled our escort . Almost as we started , the character of the country began to change : the slopes of the hills grew sharper , the valleys narrower , scattering hardwood trees appeared , the villages became fewer and fewer , the grain-towers we saw less and less often . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was cold , hard work climbing . A few steps forward , and a step back we slid . When we stood , at last. , on the windy tops , there was inner vision from these va n t age-points . We looked at the grandeur of the far-stretching earth . Under t he brilliant . Manchurian sky we could see for miles and miles , range after range of winter white hills , bare and brown in spots where the wind had blown the snow away . A few brown huts and the brown circling road way below us were the only signs of habitation . All things material receded . Even the hills stood aloof , clothed in cold snow . We dwelt apart in spiritual calm . We felt at one with the learned man of India who had at his finger-tips all the ways of London , all the affairs of India , and yet renounced everything and departed far into the hills , where , on the brow of a mountain , lie made himself into a beggar and a holy man , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were one with the Hebrew crying , ' I will lift up my eyes unto the hills . ' We were one with the first Chinese frontiersman who had made it his duty to build a wayside shrine just where the road went over the brow of the hill , leaving a tree to spread its protecting branches in - wind and calm , in rain and sunshine , over the crude altar . We longed to offer incense there , and to toll the bell that hung from a branch of the tree , and thus announce to the valley that one more man had felt the need of something beyond food and raiment . Three days more . Finally , there began to be timber on the slopes . There was scarcely a hut . The first day we lost our way entirely and found ourselves fifteen li off our road . That meant two hours more added to the traveling clay and it brought us at tiffin to no inn at all . The next clay we met a peasant boy pulling a sled . ' How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' our escort cried , stopping him on the road . " fo hell with you ! ' the boy answered . I 'm not going along the road to tell you the way , ' he finished insolently . I 'll teach you to insult a soldier out . on official business ! ' roared our escort , hitting him with the butt of his rifle . Then , so quickly that it made us blink , down from a but on the hillside came the men of the boy 's patriarchal family . The oldest one , with a quavering voice but a strong right arm , belabored our erstwhile brave soldier and marched him to the hut on the hill . Night was coining clown through the narrow valley . We were a bit rueful over the loss of half our escort. , but concluded that , one was as good as two of such brave men , and hurried along without more ado . When we entered the inn that night we beheld a witch 's cave . Great clouds of smoke circled to the dim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caldrons standing over the open braziers . Over them leaned tall men of the North , their faces sinister in the alternate gloom and flashes of light from the wood fires . On the long Pangs clown each side of the room , sprawled the shadowy figures of uncouth wayfarers . By the dark , grotesquely small k'ang tables they hunched , drawing in hot draughts of tea with a loud sucking sound . The earth floor was wet and slimy with the melting snow from the feet of many comers . The dried meat , the baskets of condiments hanging by crooked sticks from the dimly seen rafters , took on fantastic and savage shapes . Our frugal meal of hot tea , sausage , and dry bread finished , we crawled under the blankets on one end of the warm k'ang , for we were to get no privacy that night ( there was no inner room that we could either beg or command ) . The warmth was acceptable , and despite the smoke and flaring fires we fell asleep . I was dreaming that I was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idle dream . Many a late traveler had come in while we innocently slept . The cooking-pots at the end of the k ' anus , whose fires served the double purpose of heating the lc ' angs through a system of flues and cooking extra large quantities of chow , had been filled to their utmost capacity , with a proportionate amount of lire built under them . So while the innkeepers did a thriving business , and we slept , the stove beds grew hotter and hotter , until the grateful heat of early evening turned into a red-hot grill . Wearily we turned and turned . The sensation was that of freezing on our upper side and grilling on our lower . Poking holes in the paper windowpanes , we watched for the dawn . With the first streak of light we roused our retinue . That day we were to make Mao Erh Shan , the Mecca of the lumbering man . Every one was tired , and a tired Chinaman , be he a big brave soldier or a stalwart carter , is a whining crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wander ride ? - less while he rocle on the back of our cart ; the other refused to trot his animal . ' It was colder trotting , ' he complained . The carters , too , refused to hurry ; they also were tired and their mules as well . ' Let . its stop , ' they coaxed . When we refused they all started to turn in at a wretched inn twenty li short of Mao Erh Shan , our destination . We were in despair . Then the boy , our staff and our rod in difficulty , came to the rescue . He climbed up on the soldier 's pony and beat Into into a wobbling trot . Ilis long fur gown flapped to the four winds ; the pony baulked and plunged , but the boy beat on and on with the silly lit tle whip , until our mules caught the excitement and act u-ally trotted . The twenty li were made , and Mao Erh Shan . Thus ended ( Ile second stage of our journey . Iv Even as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were no longer in the silent white wilderness . All round its rose the sounds and smells of teeming life . Our breakfast quickly eaten , we were out on the street . Rough characters with strong , insolent faces slouched along ; the restaurants were as thick as flies in summer . The occasional shops looked incredibly prosperous for China . There was none of the ahnost penurious thriftiness that usually marks even the wealthiest shops . The owners boasted that they had refused the agency of several large foreign firms . ' It does n't pay to bother with them , ' they said arrogantly . They saw things large ; they talked big . ' Everywhere were the evidences of good wages , of the large profits of a new country . It reminded one of the mad life of Alaska when the miners came in with their pokes of gold . Money came easily and it went even more easily . Lust and license ran riot as they do in lumbering camps t he world over , only here there was the momentum gained from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new country 2 1 8 OVER THE FROZEN YALU deleted material fighting on the road , and will you be so kind as to wait , at least until to-mor-row ? ' Of course there was nothing to do but ' be so kind as to wait . ' ' ! ' lie carters had a lovely , quiet afternoon of snoring sleep after their midday wine ; for us there was nothing to do but go out and ruefully survey the snow melting in the afternoon sun , and sit in the inn listening to tales of bandits . Whether it was clue entirely to fate , or whether the gods conspired against us , I really can not say . I am inclined to believe the latter . I think the gods reasoned this way : ' We can not allow any one to hurry the East , however necessary it may be to him personally . If it is once allowed , there is no telling where it will stop . We must save a few quiet corners , else gods , and fairies , and beloved vagabonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had carried out our rushing programme for only two days when , in a wide valley between His , our shaft-mule fell lame . First he began going very slowly , then he limped , and finally , as we came to the end of the valley and started on the inevitable pull upwards , he refused altogether to go on . What were we to do ? Schnicklepenutz got down to look him over . He grunted angrily ; it was evident that he was not going to risk the life of a perfectly good mule . Then there was a consultation and an argument ; everybody got out . First Benoni climbed down from Isis cart , then came the boy , then our middleman extricated himself , and last of all , as he could not be heard in the discussion , clown jumped my husband . Sun , the middle-man , who liked ease and not too many hours in a cart , was for stopping . Schnicklepenutz , who wished to lose neither his mule nor his three good dollars a day , was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fig for the mule , the money , or the ease , was for going on ; not that he felt the danger of delay ,  --  to that all Chinese are superbly indifferent , ? but he was highly disgusted with them all . We , who ( lid not intend to risk our lives on t he rotten ice of the far-away river , were for hunting for a new equipment ; only we knew all too well that , if our retinue wanted something else , however acquiescent they might seem to our wishes , the new equipment would not be forthcoming . Then Benoni , who was a relative of Schnicklepenutz and wanted to keep intact the mules and money of the family , offered a solution : put our big white pulling-mule in the shafts and give the lame one the lighter work . Since the big white one had never been in the shafts and was an ill-tempered beast to boot , he , Benoni , would be the driver , as he was the best hand with the animals . The leather buckled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harness knotted , the big mule gave a wicked shake in the shafts , then started to climb without . more ado . The scheme had ' worked ! By our watches we had lost only half an hour . Up we climbed , the big mule pulling bravely and the alert . Benoni flicking the ears of all three at just the moment to avoid every frozen lump , every stone . It was a work of art , the ascent of that pass ! We almost . concluded to ride down in order to save time and see lienoni 's fine work . Still , as Schnicklepenutz , his heavy brain working more slowly , had not reached the brow of the hill , we might as well walk , especially as Benoni was discreet ly tying our wheels . We waved him on ; it is never safe to be ahead of the carts on a clown grade , for sometimes they take a sudden slide . Benoni , whip and lines in one hand and the other free to steady the cart , ran along at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The white mule squared Isis haunches , planted all his four feet firmly ; the cart with its locked wheels slid behind him . We danced after them down the wintry road , Faster and faster they went . We fell behind , panting , and then stopped , transfixed to the spot . The mules were running ; the cart . was hopping at their heels . Benoni was plunging along , but never for an instant did he stop swinging that circling whip . Now the mules were galloping ! The cart seemed to be climbing up their backs . The melting snow hid a glaze of slippery ice , and Benoni 's felt shoes were his undoing . Running full tilt , down he went , his whip still waving , and slid headlong over the ice . In one lightning moment the heavy studded wheel of the cart rode over him . We closed our eyes . When we looked , Benoni was dragging himself by means of his hands back up the road toward us . His first instinct pulled him away from that awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him was his cart all tangled in some underbrush , hanging just above a precipice , and the mules lying flat in the snarled harness , with one shaft pinning the white mule to the ground . By this time we had all , even the supercilious boy , reached Benoni . Why he was alive we could not understand ; but we found that the ugly wheel had passed over his leg only , and his padded trousers ? two or three pairs  --  had saved it from being broken . There was the mark of the iron studding on his flesh , and his face was white and drawn with suffering . With set teeth he got up on his feet and took a few steps toward the inn in the valley below . Schnicklepenutz had already departed to view the wreck of his possessions . Hurt relatives were all very well , but what about hurt mules and broken carts ? We turned round to see his short legs astride one mule 's head . The bad nude had grown restive and was endangering the cart and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own possessions , corralled a passerby for Benoni to lean upon , and departed . The stout cart and stouter mules were all right , but the ropes that held our boxes to the back of the cart had broken , and our clothes , business reports , and cherished rations were scattered far down the ravine . A morning lost , a lame mule , a hurt driver , our few biscuits in the mud at the bottom of the ravine , business reports torn , and no farther toward that river . We will not try to hustle the East. , ' ruefully said my husband ; ' even the mules are against it . Still , there 's the river ! ' In the course of the next two hours we all reached the inn , where they applied hot wine to poor Benoni 's wounds . Then there was a furious discussion as to what to do with the lame mule and the hurt driver . One thing was evident : we must start that afternoon . It scented cruel to Benoni , but it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly bruised , he would be stiffer and sorer long before he was better . If it were something worse , our best course was to get him to a doctor at once . Theories were good , but who should drive ? It takes a long time to learn to guide the proverbially stubborn mule with the flick of a whip and a few guttural notes . Up came the boy . Why had we not thought of him before ? Was n't he a carpenter , a poler of boats , a farmer ? He could not drive very well , but he could flick the whip and Benoni promised to sit out in front . and give the ! zit fzus and oah oaks , and Schnicklepenutz was to drive each cart in turn clown the passes . With such highly specialized labor we started . The first day was finished . We had moved slowly but surely toward our destination . A second day and then a t hird , and we were start ed on the fourth . Ily changing our course we had struck an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That day we had to grit our teeth anew . There is no quitting on the trail , even if a steep pass does suddenly confront you toward dark , after the evening freeze has set in and made the melting streams , that had covered the road during the day , turn to a smooth glare . Lame mule , sick driver , every one had to buckle to the work in hand . Every one except the sick driver was out to lighten the pull-back of the carts . The drivers clucked and clucked , and when t he mules slipped and gave up , slash ! went the whips , goading them on to a frantic leap . Our ' escort ' and my husband pushed from behind ; Sun and I followed with rocks to block the wheels if the cart started sliding . We were on the last steep grade . The lame mule , panting , sweating , went clown ; he cart slid ; our stones did not hold , and back toward the other cart . it began to glide . Frantically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a sickening moment , but we got them there in time . Just how that last grade was made I do not know . My whole will was set on the task of not breaking down . I must not be a quitter . Long ago I had honestly earned the name of ' trail woman ' from my husband , and I was not going to lose it now . So I kept saying to myself , ' Brace up and be a man . ' So saying , and watching the moonlight streaming over the valley , I kept plodding behind my husband toward a light that seemed to evade our approach . Then , after an eternity , we were at the inn and drinking hot tea that brought tears to my eyes . It was just the tea , I am sure ; my husband did not see them . Benoni secured a driver for his team and we got a whole outfit to take the place of Schnicklepenutz 's . Such a cart ! It was like the one-boss shay ? so old that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break-up ; and t he driver resembled his vehicle . Old in limb and soul , he had no interest in anything but it large bean-cake for fodder which , with the stubbornness of old age , he was determined to put directly under the place where I sat . And we named him Jehoshaphat . We planned it all out : six hundred li to do ; ten Ii an hour , ten hours a day , a stop of one day at t he station on the river . And then across ? if the gods were good ! We made the river in the seven days ! They said carts were still crossing , but that was not altogether reassuring . The Chinese often cross frozen rivers till some one falls in . Still , we thought the thaws had not been sufficient to melt the thick underlying masses of ice . If only we could choose it lucky place ! To the river we went in the gray early morning . We all sat perched on the front of the cart ( the inside would be it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracks .
