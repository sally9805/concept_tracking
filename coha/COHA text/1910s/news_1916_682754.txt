txt To the aristocratic family of suburban clubs another is to be added . Application for Incorporation for the Lakewood club was made at Springfield , today by Stanley Field . Frank Hubbard , and Orville E. Babcock . The club is to be patterned somewhat after the Saddle and Cycle club . " said Mr. Field . " We need a congenial meeting place for folks Interested in riding for the fun of the thing . As yet the club exists only on paper . Jr . month ago at a meeting of some thirty men a committee was appointed to look over available sites , but it has not reported yet . " No officers have been elected and nothing has been done towards letting contracts for the buildings . Tho architect has not been selected either . " Mr. Field refused to say what sites have been considered . The membership . he said , Would be drawn mainly from the people of Lake Forest and neighboring suburbs . He could not hazard a guess , nhen the club will be completed .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
