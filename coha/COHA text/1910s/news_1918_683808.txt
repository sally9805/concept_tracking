txt Sales of the United States Rubber Co. for the first two months of the ' current year gained approximately 40% over the same period in 1917 . A 40% increase in business continued throughout the year would bring sales for 1919 up to better than 9240 , - 000,000 . In this connection , however , it should be borne in mind that the company did its big business in 1911 in the closing months of the year . In other words it is rather unlikely the proportionate gain in the closing half of the year will run up to the average of the first two months . But even allowing for a fair reduction there is little doubt but the United States Rubber Co. will do a business in 1919 of better than $210,000,000 . Sales in 1917 amounted to slightly over $176,000,000 which was a gain of $50,000,000 or 40 , " : ' 0 over the 1916 figures . In other words the company is continuing the proportionate gain through the first two months of 1919 that was shown for the full year 1917 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's plant in Providence is a much bigger proposition than was indicated in the bare announcement of last week . This plant will be in a position within a few months to turn out heavy truck tires at the rate of $20 , - 000,000 a year . The plant only cost the United States Rubber Co. $500,000 . Just how important a factor this new plant will be in considering the future of the United States Rubber Co. may be gleaned from the fact that its total tire business in 1917 was something over $55,000,000 although this in turn represented a remarkable gain of something like 515,000.000 or nearly 40% over 1916 . The new plant . therefore , will allow for a 35% increase in the company 's tire capacity if figured on the dollar basis . Of course , only a part of this benefit will accrue to the company in the current year as considerable remodeling and installation of new machinery will be necessary over the next few months . Business of the United States Rubber Co. is divided into three important departments -- t ; res , boots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a business somewhat better than $55,000,000 in 1917 the tire department represented a little better than 30% of the company 's total business . Addition of the new plant will probably mean that the proportion of tire business to total sales will be considerably larger by 1919 than for 1916 and 1917 . Estimating that United States Rubber 's business for 1918 will show a minimum of $210,000,000 it will represent a gain of 66% over 1916 and 127% over 1915 . As indicated above the final figures for the current year are liable to show a considerable gain over the minimum estimate given here . In fact those close to the United States Rubber affairs will not be surprised if the final figures run above $225,000,000 . At the annual meeting of the United States Rubber Co. at New Brunswick , N. J. , the authorized number of directors was increased from 21 to 24 . The following were added to the board : Nathaniel Myers , Ernest Hopkinson , and J. Newton Gunn .
