txt A Glorious ROOD of Ludlow , Record Mass. , has seen fit of Negatives . every year for some time past to give a gold watch  --  and much incidental advertising ? to a young man who has never sworn , never used tobacco or alcohol , and never kissed a girl not a member of his ( the young man 's ) own family . These requirements have been met this year by HOWARD U. BENNETT , who has just attained his majority in Ludlow Centre . Whether Mr. Roon gives the watches as a reward or as a consolation is not made clear by the dispatches . As no biography of Mr. RooD Is at hand we are also left in a state of painful uncertainty as to whether or not he could himself qualify for a like prize offered by another . The fact that he is able to give away gold watches would , indeed , lend some support to the assumption that in the course of his life Mr. ROOD has paid more attention to the doing of things than to abstention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he 1119. y have inherited Isis money , and with it a great admiration for the negative virtues as those best calculated to enable a man to live safely within his income from Invested capital earned by somebody else . It may be , however , that Mr. Roon is a man of subtle humor  --  that he distributes his watches with fun appreciation not only of the fact that such praise as the recipients get will be half pitying and half derisive , but of the other tact that not one man in a thousand who has amounted to anything , to whom the world owes anything , either could or would have taken a watch on any such terms . Of course it is not the intention here to contemn the virtues , even the negative virtues , or to contend that the vices , even the small vices , are essential to manliness . The fact remains , however , that to the knowledge of everybody there is something seriously the matter with the man , young or old , whose claim to fame is that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . Not one of the acts barred by the Rood standard is , as an occasional lapse ; incompatible with efficiency or goodness in the very highest senses of those words . One of our neighbors wonders if the estimable Mr. BENNETT can tell time by his new watch . Probably , for he would learn that in order that he might go to bed at precisely the same early hour every night and claim another offensive superiority tothe other young men in Ludlow Centre , . We shall hear next that he never gave his mother a moment 's anxiety , was content to wear lottg curls till 10 years old , and from earliest childhood has had ' a horror of getting his hands dirty . As proof of his power No Evidence to cure disease by the in This laying on of hands , Exhibition . the man who calls himself " Bishop " OLIVER C. SABIN hired a hall in Washington on Sunday and in the presence of many spectators laid his hands on half a dozen persons who seemed to be ill and in pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limping or whatever It was that each had done and announced that the experiment had been successful .

Beyond any : question there are some maladies that can be removed , and others that can be temporarily relieved , by . this as by any one of twenty other ways of bringing teebear the power of suggestion . NO competent diagnostician , however , had , determined beforehand that these ' six " subjects " had any disease at all , and none. , by a subsequent examination could bear witness to a recovery . In other words , - nothing whatever was proved , and what faith  --  to . give a large name tocredulity  --  oun compliah ' wax , demonstrated , net by ' Ow supposed invalids , but by the assembled " investigators , " who are said to have watched the meaningless scene with deep seriousness and to have gone away much impte.seed by what they saw .

This is a late day for exploiting the theory ' that the suggestionist , the hypnotist , the " mental healer " of any sort , uses up " will power " or some even more mysterious store of energy when he exercises his art . It is now perfectly well known that he does no such thing , though he can by auto-suggestion make himself think so and thus bring upon himself all the symptoms of weariness . This is what one must assume , in charity , that " Bishop " SABIN did , but sincerity in delusion is far from enough to justify the pretension to practice medicine , and were it not for the curious fact that few except those who can be cured or helped by such as he ever apply to them for aid , he would be a more dangerous member of society than he is . Even with this unconscious and involuntary selection of fitting patients he and all his kind are quite dangerous enough .

" Lone . ly , " the signature he used , is significant of his mental state , , and he fr:inkly revealed that he had been observing his acquaintances with the possibility in mind of giving his late wife a successor . He thinks he has found a fitting mate , but he has not spoken . The thought of the next world troubles him , and he wants to know what his relations will be there to two women whom he has married here . " Can we love two or three wives , " he asked , " as we love children , without a difference ? " Apparently none of the many replies to this question that have already been made by theologians quite satisfies our correspondent . Probably none will . Our own guess is that he must decide for himself , keeping in mind , not what he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The chances are that his dubiety will lessen if his new flame burns more clearly and warmly .
