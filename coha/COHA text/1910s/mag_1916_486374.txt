The Rising Tide . By Margaret Deland . New York : Harper &; Brothers . Mrs. Deland has been especially happy , hitherto , in the interpretation of what may be called cap and bonnet womanhood . There are resolute spirits among her Old Chester ladies , but they have their being in an atmosphere of ladyhood . They belong to an age in which one might consent to be a gentlewoman , or an accomplished female , but would not choose to be labelled with the harsh and slightly coarse word , woman . The passage of half a century has changed all that . Ladythood has passed out , womanhood has boldly asserted itself , in its own character at first , and more recently as an estate which is just the same as manhood , only rather more so . But if Dr. Lavender had had the problems of feminism to deal with , among his other problems , he would have approached them , we may be sure , in much the spirit of good-humored inquiry which marks this narrative . " Fred " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humdrum households in our time . She is full of faith in herself and in her sex , and ? bases that faith upon theoretical distrust of the other sex . She is a rebel and a dissenter . She hates shams , and has learned from Shaw and Nietzsche and other timely guides for children that pretty much everything that is old and established is a sham . She is sure that there ought to be a single code for men and women , and signalizes her conviction by aping the vices of men . With it all , she is ordinarily innocent enough and feminine enough , and , if she is lucky and the right opportunity comes , quite happily backslides into the debased and antiquated trade of wife and mother . Fred Payton is badly infected with the fashionable disease . Her mother is a fool and a reactionary , therefore Fred neglects and insults her . Women ought to be independent , economically and otherwise , therefore Fred must play at business , and subject herself to various social perils . She must make speeches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flout men , and in all ways prove her superior wisdom and ability . Meanwhile her youth and sex are at work , and easily betray her into love for the good-looking , good-humored young fellow with whom she has been playing at friendship . She thinks he returns her feeling , but he is really attracted to a girl of the old-fashioned type , and Freddy has to pass through deep waters of humiliation . A better mate is awaiting her Deland treats all this as a serious problem of the day , recognizing that the tide of woman is rising , and must rise above the " ladylike " levels of the past . If her story shows the folly of current militant and aggressive methods , it does not deny the existence of a goal . The Woman Gives . By Owen Johnson . New York : Boston : Little , Brown &; Co . The author of that flimsy and popular literary Broadway show , " The Salamander , " could hardly be expected to stay his hand from further easy profits . The present story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same false glamour of white lights and nocturnal feasting , and sex experiment , and shoddy moralizing . Bachelors of both sexes disport themselves here , with pleasing freedom ; and a sensational plot duly unfolds itself for the edification of that youth which owns the newsstand as its alma mater . Our heroine , to be sure , is at the other extreme from the leading lady of " The Salamander " ? which might have been called " The Woman Who Takes . " Inga is a sort of priestess of generosity , and sex is her temple . Artists , she perceives , are a weak lot , always falling beneath themselves , and taking to drink , or worse , on the apparent theory that this sort of thing represents a kind of getting-back-at whatever-has baffled them . It is for Inga to rescue and uplift them by ? the temporary gift of herself . Here in the foreground is a gentleman known as Dangerfield , who is in a very bad way indeed . He is a great genius , but he has married a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely drunken and disorderly , by way of giving fate what-for . Inga takes him in hand , though he does n't care to be taken in hand , and has him on his feet in no time . That is to say , she has to fetch him out of the gutter more than once , but he presently stays out because he loves her so  --  and asks her to marry him . She does not care for marriage , since she thinks of herself as only the doctor , and knows this patient will not need her always , while some other is sure to . She loves Dangerfield , but loves her duty more . So she marries him , with the proviso that she may leave him and follow her star , whenever she sees fit ; and ( here we observe the author 's stern realism in action ) she actually does that , as soon as Dangerfield has fulfilled himself , and another derelict has appeared , signalling , in the offing . We recall no recent popular tract masking a plea for sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . A Sentimental Dragon . By Nina Larrey Duryea . New York : George H. Doran Co. $1.25 net . Down the steps of his cousin 's house in the Faubourg St. Honore ran Jehan de Reizet , plump into the arms of adventure in discreet black with white cotton hosiery . But this adventure led him , alas ! to the house of his sworn foes , the rich Americans who lived next door to his own hOtel and insisted on trying to buy his garden to play in . But , of course , Jehan had a brother in Eton collars who did not share the family prejudice against rich Americans ; and Sylvia , the daughter of " The Idea , " was exactly the sort of American girl who bears that kind of a name in this kind of a story . Moreover , Madame Petan , the discreet and sentimental dragon in black , mixed up the two brothers in her zeal to prevent the joint plans of Mrs. Bradish and the Due de Petrinac from maturing in the lifelong unhappiness of Sylvia . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an international spy and a pearl necklace and a French chateau and a great deal of true love , this perfectly absurd story manages to keep the reader turning its pages , in spite of a naive and woful waste of words and such verbal eccentricities as " the unknown quantity is always to be suspicioned.
