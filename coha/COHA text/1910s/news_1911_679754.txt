Mr. Mitchel 's address was the feature of the dinner . Many times in his references to the Mayor and his " weak tolerance of disgraceful conditions and scandals " here , he Was forced to stop speaking until the applause subsided , The conditions at Coney Island Summer before last , which Mr , Mitchel described as shocking and disgraceful , the scandal in the City Chamberlain 's , office of more recent date , and the " inefficiency and disorganization " of some of the city departments were all presented as the result not of any weakness in the present City Charter , but the result , he said , of weakness in the executive head of the City . Government . While he said this and more , Borough President sat a few feet away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until later , but on.1 other occasions he also had expressed similar opinions . Mr. Mitchel emphasized his statement that one of the chief purposes of the Mayor and Murphy was to use the Legislature to cheat the people out of the fruits of the Fusion administration , for which a majority had voted . " It is no new thing . in this town , " said he in this connection , " to forget and forswear a campaign pledge . It is no newl trick for the representatives of our peoPle in our Legislatures to pass laws for the effective disenfranchisement of their constituents . Thievery from the public purse by men holding from the people public trusts has been known in this city not so Infrequently as to make it more than a nine days ' wonder when it Is uncovered . Betrayal of the people for the benefit of special interests may have been attempted even in our own day and this administration under the thin cloak of . sophistry and philosophic , maxims .

Practices of graft , perfect as an Instrument of subway construction , perfect as a means of frustrating the programme of business administration inaugurated by the Board of Estimate . That 's what it was meant to do , and , in so far as a thing is perfect that would achieve the object for which it was designed , the Mayor is right , as always , and it was a Perfect Charter . " I see that he Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday night he challenged any one to put his thumbnail on a single provision in the Charter that was wrong . I am minded to take up the challenge and point out to His Slippery Honor one or two points that , as their inventorhe is fairly well acquainted with already . ' Among the points on which President Mitchel put his thumbnail were these ; That the Mayor had arranged for himself to make up the budget , spend the budget after it was made up , and audit the bills as they came in . " Nowhere in the world was there ever a representative government , " declared Mr. Mitchel , " In which one rtv.n said how e173,000,000 should be spent in a year , directed the spending of it himself , and audited the bills in payment of which it was expended . Yet that is what the Mayor attempted to do by means of this Charter , which would put him in absolute control of the entire city government . " Other speakers were William B.
