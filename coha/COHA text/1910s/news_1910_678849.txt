txt An explosion so loud that it threw the inhabitants of half a dozen tenement houses In the vicinity of 343 East Sixtyfifth Street into a panic brought the Police reserves of the East Sixty-seventh Street Station to that address on the double late yesterday afternoon . The uniformed men quieted the crowd which quickly gathered as the tenements emptied themselves , and then developed the real sensation of the incident . It provided a good night 's work for the plainclothes men and the Italian squad from Headquarters , and they are still working . There were found in a rear kitchen on the ground floor three fingers from a man 's left hand ? blood stains that could be traced through the apartment from the kitchen and out through a rear door , and besides these around the partly wrecked furniture in two rooms a large pair of shears . such as are used in clipping zinc and sheet iron . The shears gave the police their chief clue to the cause of the explosion , for they were completely covered with a fins blue powder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table knife , with a sharp steel blade , found beside the shears , was similarly coated . " Evidently , " said Capt . Hughes , who searched the apartment . " somebody here was experimenting with a bomb . It went off when he was n't looking for it and ripped his hand apart . He did n't wish to be caught , and , knowing that the explosion would bring the police , he fled. - The police were unable to find out who the injured bomb experimenter was . Leo Barry , a young Italian . who lived in the apartment , was seen fleeing through the Sixty-fifth Street entrance by the first tenants who ran downstairs . Persons in the street who were  --  attracted by the explosion said they saw him running down First Avenue but he did not appear to have been injured . The stains leading from the kitchen showed that another man was present . He did not go through the front hall , but by way of a rear door .

In a leisurely search of the deserted apartment the police found several letters addressed to Barry , but they threw no light on the experimental work with explosives . Under the kitchen table they found a can filled with scrap iron and pebbles and several cans that were empty . The police concluded that these were the rough materials for the manufacture of bombs . A stove four feet from the table , on which lay the powder-burned shears , showed no indication of having been dls ? turbed .

The neighborhood is not especially given over to any one class of residents , as it ie below the Harlem Italian quarter am above the Fourteenth Street colony .
