txt Adventures of a Pacifist . I have long been a member of a peace society . Last week I attended one of its meet ings in New York . On coming out of the ball about 5 o'clock in the afternoon , I stopped at the corner of the street , put on my glasses , and took out my purse with the intention of buying an evening paper . Thereupon a sturdy fellow who was standing near twirling up his mustache struck me , first over the head with his stick , then in the face with his fist , smashing my glasses and causing the blood to flow freely from my nose . He then took possession of my purse and thrust it In his pocket , calling loudly for the police . An officer of the law happened to be near at hand . He drew near and addressed us in polished tones , somewhat as follows : " This distressing quarrel , must . stop at once . It is annoying the bystanders ? me especially , I am not Interested to inquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscure . You will see that it would be troublesome . Besides , you both agree that you are fighting for the same thing , a purse . My advice is that you stop at once before either one has Buffered the humiliation of defeat . You will thus , quite naturally , form u warm and lasting friendship cemented in mutual confidence and esteem . " These lofty sentiments were greeted with hearty approbation by the bystanders. among whom I saw several of my associates in the peace society . These latter took n9 pains to conceal their chagrin at finding one of their associates brawling on the street . I was somewhat humiliated myself . And so , while my antagonist drove off in a taxicab , I made my *ay on foot to my hotel , where I meowed a small loan , and so came home . My present purpose is to resign from the peace society and join some group of people interested in Justice .
