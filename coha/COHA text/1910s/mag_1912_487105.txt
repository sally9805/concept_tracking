President Taft remarked , in his mess sage to Congress on Friday of last week , that a full discussion of Government business requires " more space than one message of reasonable length affords . " To this every editor and every reader  --  if any readers are left  --  will say amen . Presidential messages have been growing intolerably long Mr. Taft 's remedy is to send in three or four short ones  --  a " short " one , in Presidential definition , being considerably more than a newspaper page But there are other ways of avoiding the surplusage . It is not necessary for a President to appear to go upon the theory stated by the mediuval writer quoted by Hallam. : " This I say lest anything be left unsaid " There are whole sections of the ordinary Presidential message that could be severely cut down or left out altogether . The long rehashings of departmental reports  --  with leisurely phrases such as " I observe that the Secretary of War recommends , " or " I note that the Secretary of the Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm done . Still , if the whole must somehow be got through the Printing Office , we ought to be thankful to Mr. Taft for giving it to us in separate doses There are other reflections about such a message as he laid before Congress which he does not refer to , but which must occur to every one who gives any thought to Mr Taft 's situation . He is now obviously as one simply going through the motions However sound the positions he takes or the arguments he uses , neither he nor anybody else expects Congress to pay the slightest heed An outgoing President almost inevitably takes on the guise , in the last four months of his term , of a mere Public Functionary . This was true even of the hard-hitting Roosevelt . No sooner was it certain in 1908 that he would not again be President , than Congress began deliberately to ignore him . He sent it messages by the score , but might as well have sent them to the Dead Letter Office And in President Taft 's latest message there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his helplessness at present . He refers to his previous recommendations that the tariff be reduced , but adds that " now that a new Congress has been elected on a platform of a tariff for revenue only . . . at is needless for me to occupy the time of this Congress " Could there well be a sharper reminder of the misfit entailed by our awkward plan of having Congress not meet regularly until more than a year after it is elected ? If the argument for a change , whereby the Federal practice should be made like that of alI the States , needed any reinforcement , it could be found in the hapless plight of President Taft . He can not escape the air of doing his duty perfunctorily . The routine recommendations of his message sound more than ever routine . He has some correct and just things to say about our currency - laws and their need of reform , about the Sherman law , about the duty of giving the Porto Ricans American citizenship  --  to single out only a few topics  --  but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little fire or drive in his recommendations . He knows perfectly that they will be no more heeded than the wind that blows over the dome of the Capitol . Take the promise of accomplishing something away from a man , or a President , and you take the heart out of him . There is , however , one part of Mr. Taft 's message in which he expresses himself with warmth of conviction . This is the section referring to the Proposed pledge of speedy independence for the Philippines We make no doubt that the President holds his views on that subject conscientiously and patriotically Moreover , he is entitled to be heard on it , not only on account of his official position , but because of the fact that he was Governor of the Philippines and has shown deep interest in the welfare of their inhabitants But here he gives us a counsel of despair . Great things have been done in the Philip-pines , but all of them will be lost it American rule is withdrawn . Having been shown the better way for fourteen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Filipinos will instantly revert to a condition of barbarism if the " supervision " of the United States be broken off . President Taft admits that the Filipinos have done well in all the beginnings of self-government yet permitted them In municipalities and in the national Assembly , as in the courts , they have shown themselves , he says , as men who " can be educated and tiain.ed to complete self-government " But this must be ? " eventually . " Even a promise to them now of independence eight years ' away would " arouse dissension and disorder . " The news from Manila , with the testimony of the accredited representatives of the Philippines , is all the other way , but the President is very certain that no good could come from " a disguised policy of scuttle " It is of no use to talk to him about the United States guaranteeing the independence of the Philippines , for such a guarantee " we should be powerless to enforce . " What , the world Power that we have become , as he elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bands off what we voluntarily relinQuishf President Taft 's sincerity we do not question , but we do not believe that in this he speaks the mind of the American people . They will not forever be held back from doing an act of justice , and living up to the principles which have been bound to the very heart of the nation , by the cry of lions in the path . There is no call for hasty action ? none , in fact , is contemplated The proposal is to make the pledge and carefully watch over the steps leading up to its final execution If disaster threatens we can retrace our steps ; but if the way to the resumption of specie payments was to resume , the way towards self-government in the Philippines is to give the Filipinos a chance to show what they can do in governing themselves . THE GOVERN-ORS ' CONFERENCE . The assembling of the fifth Conference of Governors at Richmond , Va. , inevitably suggests that somehow this new piece of governmental mechanism has not fulfilled the high expectations that at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a House of Governors , a Third House that would bridge-the gap unfortunately left by the framers of the Constitution between the Federal Government and the States . With this new institution on the ground , the Twilight Zone would cease to be a safe resort for corporate malefactors of great wealth . What could not be done by Congress owing to Constitutional limitations , and what was not done by the isolated States because of inertia or worse , would be accomplished by the magic wand of uniform legislation . This was to be achieved by the same Yankee ingenuity which had made ducks and drakes of the elaborate system of the electoral colleges , taking from them the substance , while permitting them to retain the form , of power . And , indeed , the initial Conference had all the appearance of a body endowed with sufficient faith to move mountains . Meeting in the White House , almost under the shadow of the Capitol , discussing with earnestness and ability the burning question of conservation , the Governors themselves must have felt ' that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the prestige of the first , but already there began to be more than whisperings that receptions and excursions were leaving the distinguished members in poor condition , physically and intellectually , for the ostensible purpose of their gathering . To-day the proud term House of Governors is hardly applied to the organization that was to rival the historic branches of the Government . Why this chasm between promise and performance ? It must be conceded at once that there are ' inherent weaknesses in the project . Only twenty-seven Governors were present at the opening session , and not many more were in attendance at any time . We have , from Maine to California , no less than forty-eight Governors . Why should so many of them stay away from a Governors ' Conference ? Simply because dozens of men who at this moment are Governors will not be Governors a few weeks or months from now Not indifference , but a natural and necessary turning of attention to that private sphere to which their fellow-citizens have relegated them , accounts for these numerous breaks in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is bound , under the best conditions , to operate against its success . But the chief causes for the disappointment are not essential to the scheme at all . What can be practically expected from a programme that sprawls over a series of topics , many of which do not concern the majority of the Governors assembled ? The success of the first Conference was due as much to the limitation in. this respect as to its choice of a topic that was uppermost in the public mind . But this year , for instance , the Governors listened to addresses on " Modern Penology , " " A State Income Tax , " " The Development of Inland Waterways , " " Uniformity of Marriage and Divorce Laws , " " What the State Can Do to Check the Drift of Population from Farms to Cities , " and " Rural Credit . " Instead of having their hearts burn within them as they went their several ways after the close of the Conference , what can they have had to take home but buzzing heads ? It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selecting such subjects as are likely to come up in the various Legislatures this winter . They said as much . But what did they actually do ? How many Legislatures will deal at their approaching sessions with the question of a State income tax ? The number having to consider inland waterways is still less . It would have been much better to have chosen the one topic of uniform marriage and divorce legislation , and then to have arranged for speakers and discussion upon it that would have attracted the attention of the whole country , and sent the Governors back to their respective capitals with the draft of a bill that should hold first place in their legislative programmes . Such a plan as this has made the annual meetings of private associations like the American Academy of Political and Social Science so notable and influential . Then the peripatetic nature of the Conference can not be regarded as an aid to the best results . Would not its meetings at a fixed place , say , Washington , be more conducive to practical accomplishment ? We would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , and still less would we imply that it has small promise for the future The need of uniform legislation is greater rather than less than it was on the day when the Governors first came together Nothing could have been much worse for the Confer ence than a gross overrating of its promise But it might still be of real service to the States if it would concentrate its energies upon questions that are practical and of immediate urgency . TURKISH DIFFICULTIES . The disinterested sympathies of the modern world were undoubtedly with the Balkan nations in the war that is now coming to a close We say disinterested sympathies , because , so far as the greater part of Europe is concerned , special reasons of politics exist to counteract the spontaneous sentiment of the masses Thus the non-Slavic element in Austria-Hungary , the people of Italy , and probably a majority - of the German people " sympathized " with Turkey for the plain reason that the triumph of the Balkan states was detrimental to specific Austrian , Italian , and German ambitions . But it is idle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts of many millions failed to be stirred in be-. half of the Balkan people by many considerations . by their brave fight against odds ; by the fact that they were continuing the ancient war of the Cross against the Crescent ; by the fact that they were fighting for the rights of the native population against a foreign conqueror , and a conqueror whose history seems to be an unbroken chronicle of oppression , misrule , and ' massacre This attitude of sympathy , unspoiled by personal motive , may naturally be best seen in this country . But it has found expression , too , in England , where the traditional Government policy of friendliness to the Turk has been forced to take cognizance of the strong popular current in the opposite direction . To make out a case for the Turks is not , however , impossible , although it involves the two normally difficult oper-ations of going a bit beneath the sur-face of things and indulging in a little plain speaking . Taking up the issues point by point , we might argue that the attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a desperate adventure , as we see now from fuller knowledge . They were attacking an empire on the decline , by by of to Powers have not hesitated to sacrifice Christian interests for the furtherance of their own purposes . It is a delicate judgment whether responsibility for the massacre and civil war that have ravaged Macedonia rests upon the Mussulman conscience or upon the conscience of the Christian nations that have deliberately permitted Macedonia to be turned into a shambles . The recent violent quarrels among the Balkan allies here enter into the question . As to the war being an uprising of the native population against a foreign conqueror , it is to be noted that , as history goes , the occupation of a territory for some five hundred Years constitutes a pretty just claim to sovereignty . The Turks overran the Balkan peninsula more than two hundred years before the French conquered Lorraine , and more than three hundred years before the French acquired Alsace . But putting aside all such special instances , there is one point of view from which it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneficent results it may bring to the Balkan peoples , has not done great harm to a cause that is broader than the interests of the Balkan nationalities . The war has delayed and possibly destroyed forever the chance of ascertaining whether political progress and , specifically , constitutional government are really a monopoly of Christian Europe , or whether they are capable of being incorporated into the life of the Asiatic peoples as well . To those who do not regard it as an ideal state of things that one-quarter of the human race shall hold the other three-quarters in subjection , or that these three-quarters are estopped forever from the privileges and advantages of self-government , the breakdown of the Turkish experiment is a deplorable thing . China is now making the same experiment , but it is a question whether the Chinese people will get any fairer opportunity than that of the Turks . The fact of Turkish defeat has been brought forward as proof that the Mohammedan is unfit for constitutional government . There are people who now say that under Abdul Humid the Turks would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of constitutional government . That is arrant nonsense , so far as the broad aspects of the question are concerned . Granted that the army reforms introduced by the Young Turks have weakened the military strength of the Empire , it has happened largely because the Turkish army was caught in a state of transition . It surely took more than four years to develop the fighting instrument with which the rulers of Prussia brought about the unification of Germany . The fact is that the reform party in Turkey has never had a fair show . From the first moment of their success the play of European intrigue began to hum faster than ever . Austria seized a couple of provinces . Bulgaria declared its independence . The , Greeks became more active than ever in Crete . Then came the Italian swoop upon Tripoli . Decidedly , it was shown that if a. non-Christian people took to heart the lessons of Christian civilization and set about putting its own house in order , Christian Europe would not allow the thing to be done . Persia can testify to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope , of course , that the opportunity for trying out the experiment of constitutional government in Turkey has not absolutely disappeared . When a treaty ' has been made and the Turkish frontier in Europe has been brought close to Constantinople , something like a basis for lasting peace may turn out to have been attained . The Sultan will then be ruling over a Mohammedan and Ottoman population , and the element of religious and racial animosity will have been largely done away with . Stripped of her provinces , Turkey may be allowed to work out her problems ; for the simple reason that she has no More desirable provinces to take , outside of Asia . But no one will now venture to predict that Europe 's keen appetite for a neighbor 's territory will let her stop short at the new frontier , or even refrain from crossing the Bosphorus into Asia . THE STUDY OF MILITARY HISTORY . An appeal for a national society to concern itself with military history , written by Prof. R. M. Johnston , of Harvard , and published in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the question at the coming meeting of the American Historical Association . It is , of course , well known that there already exists a Massachusetts Military Historical Society , of whiaa the late John Codman Ropes was a leading spirit . State historical societies , particularly in the West , have likewise given much attention to military matters . It is felt , however , that nowhere has military history been lifted to the plane which it deserves , and that there now exists no national body which would make easy the cooperation of skilled civilian writers and technical military experts . Without such an association , Professor Johnston believes it will not be possible to produce in this country military history of the highly developed and technical kind now being worked out by the best writers in Germany and France . With the desire to supply scientific history in any field it is impossible not to sympathize . In that of war the opportunity in this country is very great As long as the nation lasts , the earn paigns of the Civil War will , we presume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford rich pickings for the historian is sufficiently illustrated by-Charles Francis Adams 's remarkable essay on the use of cavalry in the Revolution . Gen. James H. Wilson 's just published memoirs , with their startling criticisms of Grant and Sheridan , are in themselves certain to provoke acrid discussion of the theories he so vigorously advances . Indeed , hardly a week goes . by but some new contribution to the greatest of civil wars finds its way into print . Since the output is not likely to . be diminished by the passing of the generation which did the fighting , it is evidently worth while to see if some direction can be given to the contributions of the future , or at least some-standards raised by which the work may be judged . For the proper discussion and analysis of military history , Professor Johnston holds that the successful writer-must have technical knowledge of the military art , erudition , critical skill , and . literary ability . That the trained military man almost invariably lacks the last quality is obvious to all who read the Infantry Journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sheridan , and Sherman , it can truthfully be said that West Point produces excellent soldiers , but poor writers ; the lack of sufficient emphasis upon the English language and literature in an already crowded curriculum is regretted by many officers  --  particularly by those who have attempted the mazes of the Civil War records and sought to reconcile or understand the reports therein . Not that West Point must be blamed for the whole mass of slovenly writing , for its graduates were but a small minority at that time . But any one who recalls the terse , vigorous , and , often picturesque dispatches of Sheridan remembers their refreshing character in the midst of a desert of reports apparently written to conceal thought and . often to hide what actually took place . The late Col. Archibald Grade spent Afteen years trying to reconcile the reports of the battle of Chickamauga and to ascertain what really occurred there . His untimely death last week leaves the Confederate side of the story untold . A military historical society could well justify itself if it dwelt on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since it is devoutly to be hoped and , expected that we are to have no more wars , other activities of the proposed society are probably more important . We can not , however , concede that active military experience is absolutely essential , any more than we would assert that literary skill is necessary to make a great commander . Mr. Ropes was probably our foremost military critic ; for Physical reasons he could not go to war . : So , too , some of the best commentators . or the Civil War have been men who never bore arms . That the military , man is too apt to view matters narrowly ; that , like many professional men , he can not see the forest for the trees , and that he too frequently starts off with a thesis he is determined to prove ? these are all reasons that make against any soldier 's being the ideal military historian , though Professor Johnston would bestow this title on Gen. Bonnal for his " IVIanesuvre de St. Privat . " They are , moreover , grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself - worth while . We can not , however , regard as wise his suggestion that there be a section of the General Staff to devote itself to producing military history , should no national society he possible . The General Staff is a fluctuating , not a stable , ' body ; since officers can be detailed to it only for four years , and must then - return to other duty , this would alone make against continuous scientific historical production . Moreover , the General Staff does not to-day stand as well as when first organized ; it has seemed bent only on getting more officers and more men , upon hastening this peaceful nation into militarism . Congress showed its displeasure last summer by cutting off nine of the General Staff 's members . If our generals , like Messrs . Wood and Bliss , continue to talk as foolishly as they have been doing , there may be still other changes . At any rate , it is quite safe to say that , judging by articles in the Infantry Journal and the past record of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War Department it would be of the machine-made kind  --  written to demonstrate , not the truths of history , but the necessity for the national military policy which might happen to be advocated by the temporary personnel of the War Department . History of that kind is worse than no history at all . Infinitely preferable is the bare , colorless chronicling of the events of 1870-71 which distinguishes the military memoirs of Field-Marshal Von Moltke . COST OF GOING TO COLLEGE . Tuition fees , room rent , and boarding rates have been rising in the college world on a scale almost parallel to the increase in the cost of living every-where . In the Boston Transcript the other day , Henry T. Claus presented the results of a detailed investigation into conditions prevailing in thirty selected colleges to-day as compared with twen-ty years ago . In 1892 , the average tui-tion fee was almost exactly one hundred dollars , ranging from $13 at Purdue and $36 at Allegheny to $200 at Radcliffe and Massachusetts Institute of Tech-nology . Out of thirty colleges , seven-teen charged $100 or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Rad-cliffe unchanged and " Tech " gone up to $250 ; only five colleges charge less than $100 ? Purdue , Bates , Colgate , Bowdoin , and Hamilton . The increase in the cost of board during the same period has been 23 per cent . for thirty colleges ( not altogether the same as those dealt with in the matter of tui-tion fees ) . Dartmouth and Williams . are the hardest hit , with a straight ad-vance of 50 per cent . But that the phe-nomenon of high prices is country-wide , is shown by an increase of 40 per cent . at Stanford and Purdue and 35 per cent . at the University of Illinois . On the other hand , taking this single question of cost of food , we find broad variations within what is virtually the same community . This brings up that mysterious factor which makes all discussion of the cost of living so difficult  --  that equation , personal or accidental , which does make it possible for so many people to wring subsistence and comfort out ' of a statistically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleges , in Mr. Claus 's list , report no increase in the cost of boarding their students since 1892 . These zero figures are dismissed , quite properly , as indicating that either board was excessively high in these colleges twenty years ago , or that the college dining-rooms to-day are doing buliness at a loss . But , avoiding extremes , why should the increase at Amherst be only 18 per cent. , as against 50 per cent at Dartmouth , or 10 per cent . at the University of Michigan and 35 per cent . at the University of Illinois ? The obvious reply is that it depends largely upon the facilities developed by the college authorities for supplying food to the students at cost . Such machinery has been built up at Harvard in more complete form than in any college in the country , and Harvard accordingly shows almost exactly the average increase for all the colleges concerned-22 per cent. , as against an average of 23 per cent . Those colleges that fall below Harvard 's figure are to be congratulated on exceptional good fortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are apparently not facing the problem of high prices as energetically as , they might be doing . If we add to the items of tuition , board , and rent such other necessities as clothes and bOoks , it will be plain that an estimated increase of 25 per cent . in the cost of keeping a young man at college to-day , compared with twenty years ago , is moderate . Take into consideration also " the cost of higher college living , " the demand for satisfactions that were once luxuries , or even non-existent , and the rate of increase is still sharper . It would be interesting to know how large a pecuniary burden the social and athletic features of college life impose on the student . At the large universities , of course , the football team pays for pretty nearly everything ; but it must he different at the small colleges . What , too , is the effect of fraternity life on a man 's expenditures ? The fraternities are sometimes defended as institutions for enabling students to live in comfort on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comfort is more conspicuous than the economy . Presumably , those students go into the fraternities who can afford it , but the fraternity influence on the general standard of life and expenditure in a college community must be reckoned with . The one counterbalancing factor to be taken into consideration is the increase in scholarships and other forms of student aid . Thus one student reports that he entered Amherst in 1893 , paid $110 for tuition and $65 for room rent , and received scholarship aid to the amount of $87.50 . To-day , under exactly the same conditions , he would pay $140 for tuition and $55 for rent and receive as a grant in aid the sum of $140 , making his cash outlay $55 , as against $87 50 twenty years ago . But even in this case the present advantage is almost eliminated by the increase in the cost of food , which is 18 per cent . higher than it was twenty years ago . The great increase in the amount of pecuniary assistance rendered to deserving students in the form of scholarships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can reduce the cost everywhere and for every one as in the Amherst case we have cited seems incredible . Presumably , colleges do not resort to raising their tuition fees until they are absolutely forced to it . To give back in scholarships all that they gain in higher fees would be absurd . We are therefore , justified in assuming that , whatever may be the case of the exceptionally gifted student , for the student body as a whole the increase of scholarship facilities can not compensate for the direct increase in the cost of living . This state of affairs carries a sober implication for the great mass of citizens of moderate income to whom the sending of a son to college has always been a sacrifice . To-day it is a question with them not only whether the high cost of living in the home makes it possible to send the boy to college , but to a college where the law of high prices operates as it does at home A greater drain has to be met out of smaller resources . - THOROUGHNESS IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken a noteworthy step in requiring as essential to a bachelor 's degree " a special final examination upon each student 's field of concentration within the field of the division of history , government , and economics . " Primarily , this is another blow at the old idea of a college as an attractive resort where the sons of the well-to-do may idle away four years , with the assistance of tutors , while residing in luxurious dormitories or equally luxurious clubs . Next , it is a clear departure from the - elective system which was once a chief distinction of Harvard . Most important of all , it means an advance towards the thorough intellectual training of the collegian  --  towards the placing of American university training on a par with that received abroad . As such , it is a move in the same direction as the preceptorial system at Princeton , and the increasing development of the group form of studies in the establishment of which Johns Hopkins was the leader . The change is particularly notable at Harvard , since there , if anywhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haphazard nature of most studying under the elective system , were especially marked twenty years ago . If a man had no particular aptitude , or was interested in a number of subjects , his education at Harvard at that time was bound to be desultory and superficial . He would acquire a smattering of fine arts , of Greek and Latin , of German and French , of geology , history , economics , and government ; but if he did not continue his studies after graduation , he went through life with but a small pail of that scholarship which marks the graduate of Paris and Berlin or Oxford and Cambridge . The disappearance of the old rigorous courses in classics removed the chief source of the moral and mental discipline in the graduates of earlier years , even though their range might be limited . They had no smattering of a dozen or fifteen subjects , but what they knew they knew well , and , more than that , by mastering certain branches of knowledge they had laid the foundations for attacking and conquering others . Precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may judge by the new regulation . Against the system of daily , half-yearly , and yearly examinations we have heard many protests ; they make cramming possible , they guarantee in no wise the thoroughness of a student 's knowledge , and they place at a disadvantage the student who recites well but under pressure expresses himself badly . But before a group examination at the close of four years of study , such as is proposed , most of these protests fall . A similar examination has long been the stepping-stone to a degree of doctor of philosophy . If this one is properly worked out , the candidate for the A.B . who has specialized in the field of history , government , and economics must know that field . He can not as a senior pass well in advanced American history when his knowledge of the origins and the early forms of our government comprises merely a hazy recollection of a course in colonial history to which he listened in his freshman year . How rapidly this system can be extended to other coordinated branches of study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on fertile fields at Harvard and in other colleges is highly probable . Since the idea is also to stimulate men to read for themselves , it should seem not improbable that Harvard might come ere long to a preceptorial system of some kind or other , so that in their search after a well-rounded and comprehensive knowledge students would have personal touch with an instructor and his cooperation . Certainly , the fostering of the student 's own initiative , the giving him the desire to browse along collateral lines , is of the utmost importance If the final examination does this , it will accomplish great things . But to us it seems as if no examination could achieve what is aesired if there be no guides for the wayfarer , to show at least where the longed-for paths of knowledge begin and by what signs one may follow them through the forest of learning . Then , if this pilgrimage be undertaken in the right spirit , the wayfarer will find new openings , new beauties , for himself ; the more of them that lead him beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The final test will prevent too random browsing ; but that which reveals unexpected visions will make for that culture which ' is at best so hard-to attain in all our institutions of learning . Indeed , it is another milestone in our search for thoroughness of training and breadth of scholarship which has thus been set , as opposed both to the superficiality of the present and to the pedantic acquirement of fact which has far too often passed both for broad knowledge and humane culture .
