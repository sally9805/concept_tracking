IN New York there is , of course , a Latin Quarter . It lies , by the shortest reckoning , some six miles from where most people would place it . Nine citizens out of ten , if you said Latin Quarter to them , would stare a moment and remark , " Oh , yes , Washington Square , " and recommend the Sixth Avenue " L. " Now , the Sixth Avenue " L " ' is right enough , but instead of getting off at Bleecker Street or Eighth Street , you continue north for twenty-two minutes by schedule . For what your in- formant has in mind is Bohemia and Miss Geraldine Farrar , or Trilby , if he is old enough ; the garret studios where youth and the dream of art make light of starvation and the charcoal-man , the Quatz Arts ball , the cafes , the dancehalls . Our New York equivalent for that is undoubtedly Washington Square with its studios ? though the garrets are missing ? its social and artistic heresies , and the flavor of foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Learned men before me have pointed out for Paris that the place consecrated  | to art , young love , and velveteens is today not the Quartier Latin at all , but Montmartre , several miles across the river . The district on the left bank of the Seine is to-day , predominantly , what it has been for six hundred years , a vicinage in which there are a great many people who could actually speak Latin if they chose to . It is the bailiwick of the highbrows , the dons , the learned faculties in silk gowns , the forty-two-centimeter savants of the Institut , the Sorbonne , the University of France . There is probably less actual canvas-splashing done in the Latin Quarter to-day than in any other section of Paris , and more lofty thinking to the square foot than anywhere else on earth . It contains fewer grisettes than bespectacled students from Russia , the Balkans , the two Americas . Where the Mimis are popularly supposed to be sighing for their Rodolphes , on the Left Bank , M. Bergson expounds the mysteries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the region where the French Academy in two hundred and fifty years of devoted labor has carried the Dictionary of the French language through the letter F. An ancient name for the vicinity is L'Universite . That supplies the necessary hint and our own New York parallel . Our own Latin Quarter is not around Washington Square , but on Morningside Heights . Its dominating figure is not Mr. Robert Henri or whoever may be the present head of the Newest School , but Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler . In a district of not much more than one-fifth of a square mile you find all the requisites of a Latin Quarter in the precise historical sense I have set down . It is an area of which fully two-thirds are given up to public buildings ? educational , religious , and eleemosynary . It has all the necessary furnishings to make not merely a satisfactory parallel with Paris , but an astonishingly complete parallel . It has a great university , very nearly the most populous in the country . It has the seminaries of two theological creeds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its kind in the country . It has the country 's greatest cathedral , which will also be the country 's most beautiful cathedral if the architects ever decide what it will look like . It has a great hospital , St. Luke 's , which , for many years to come , seems destined to overtop the cathedral across the street . For the Pantheon , near the Seine , it has our greatest commemorative monument after the Washington obelisk on the Potomac ? the Tomb on Riverside Drive . For the gardens of the Luxembourg it has two park belts which are also its boundaries , Morningside on the east and Riverside on the west , so that on Academic Heights a heavy stream of erudition , piety , and charity flows between solid banks of verdure . For a match to the Seine it has the Hudson . It is more than a match . When you think of what the Europeans have done with their twopenny rivers and then look at the Hudson , across to the Palisades , south to the harbor , north to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank reveals a prospect of infinity , you have not the least doubt as to where the Seine , the Thames , and the Rhine will be when we have piled up two thousand years of historical association , of romance , and of reverie , like that in which the transatlantians have swathed their picayune streams . You might take the Seine , the Thames , and the Rhine and place them side by side in the Hudson and have enough room left for an All-American Henley . But because we have not yet at hand a Wordsworth or a Whistler , our unrivaled waterways must see their immense raw resources of beauty and romance monopolized by the prose poets of the Albany Day Line . You can imagine what the Europeans would do with the Hudson if they had it ? the Dickenses , the Hugos , who have wound and curled the murky streams of Thames and Seine through the life of their capitals , making the river a force . an agent . a mirror , a commentator upon  | the life on its banks . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cities London Bridge and Pont Neuf . Hardly a hero of Parisian fiction crosses the Pont Neuf without making it his confidant . Yet what is the tiny current of the Seine to the mighty sweep of the Hudson ? What are the lights on the bridges of Paris to the thousand lights of mystery that swing along the base of the Palisades north and south ? lights of heavy , squat barges lost in the shadows ; lights on trim , white yachts reflected in the sheen of their enamel ; and the sudden upflare of huge spouts of flame from the furnaces and gas-houses on the western bank ? It is only a question of finding our Dickens , Wordsworth , or Hugo , before the electric blaze of the great real-estate advertising frames on top of the Palisades is coined into legend and story . Our Latin Quarter is something more than half a mile in length , from ' loth Street , where the Synod Hall and Bishop 's residence of St. John 's show that the Gothic may be brand-new and vet beautiful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbia University . Five hundred feet to the north the Hebrew Theological Seminary is the last educational outpost , while in the extreme western corner we must prolong the frontier to 123d Street , so as to include Grant 's Tomb . Just below the southern border are the workrooms of the National Academy of Design . From Morningside Park on the east to the river is a matter of less than a third of a mile . From all four sides the ground rises , gently from the south and west , more sharply from the north , almost perpendicularly from the east , to the crest of the plateau of which the exact median point is occupied by Alma Mater on the steps of the Low Library . Thus from three sides the University may be reached with only a modicum  | of leg-work , though from the east it is a stiff climb . Morningside Park is probably the most perpendicular public garden in New York , and perhaps anywhere ; I am unacquainted with the landscapegarden system of Tibet . For the freshman the one hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind . The faculty takes them as a form of exercise , and plods up with a good deal of effort , to stop for breath at the foot of Karl Bitter 's statue of Carl Schurz in a bronze hemicvcle which is part of the retaining wall for the park . If one is honest he will admit that he stops for breath at the feet of Carl Schurz , but you can make out an excellent case if you pretend that it 's the view . The top of Morningside is the one place where one may see across the entire breadth of Manhattan Island , and only at two points on this acropolis . One is precisely at the foot ofCarl Schurz 's statue , the other is a fifth of a mile farther north on this same upper edge of the park wall at 120th Street . From these two vantagepoints there is a clear view , west to the Palisades , and east to the Long Island Sound . At the foot of the hill lies the city ? Harlem and the towers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here again I can not help thinking of the countless heroes of French fiction from Balzac through Zola to the most contemporary of moderns who have looked down from Montmartre upon the lights of Paris and yearned or cried defiance . Possibly there are upper classmen at Columbia who look down from Morningside on the city of five millions and dream of conquest . I can even imagine a sophomore , after an unfortunate mid-year exam. , poised in reverie over the balustrade . As I have said , we need only the genius and inspiration . The city is there . The region has its background of history , though the chronicle does not reach so far back as in the Latin Quarter on the Seine , where they show you the ruins of Roman baths under the Museum of Cluny , and streets which are supposed to be very much as Dante found them when he followed lectures in Theology 3 at the university . Morningside is Revolutionary ground . General Washington retreated by the Bloomingdale Road to Harlem Heights and beyond , and the British camped on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either side of the valley which Fort Lee commuters now call Manhattan Street and took  | pot-shots at each other . Then General Washington attempted a surprise , sent his troops across the valley , and struck the enemy on both flanks . The battle - of Harlem Heights was a success , but not enough of a success . General Washington gave up his comfortable quarters in the Jumel Mansion to resume his historic task of dotting the countryside with Washington 's Headquarters , and the American army made its way across the North River for Trenton and points west . Block-houses still mark the strategic points in this region , one at the northern edge of Central Park , another at the northern edge of Morningside Park at 123d Street . A bronze tablet in the wall of one of the University buildings at 117th Street commemorates the battle of Harlem Heights . The manor-houses of the colonial era gave way to farms and market-gardens . Then came the squatters , with their shacks perched on comparatively slight but inaccessible heights . To the student of comparative zoology , Morningside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island of the domestic goat . They were there when Columbia moved to the Heights from 49th Street in 1897 , and for a number of years , though in dwindling numbers , they continued to maintain themselves amid the encroaching waves of a new Kultur . Only a year or two ago there was on exhibition if1 the window of a drug-store fronting the Campus the stuffed effigy of what purported to be the last survivor of this interesting race , Hircus hibernicus Academi ; us . In that drug-store to-day students eat their nut sundaes at the soda-counter , and so the imtnemorial past and the present , even as on the banks of the Seine , rub elbows . Unquestionably , the route by which the distinguished visitor should be made to approach Morningside Heights is from the east , by one of the cross-streets that run from the Park into the thickets of the Harlem ghetto . If you come up by Riverside Drive , the magnificent road and the river may not leave sufficient enthusiasm for the gradual unveiling of the charms of the Heights proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east of Eighth Avenue will the visitor catch full tilt the complete beauty of the scene the half-mile sweep of the wooded amphitheater , and , crowning it , above the poplars , the choir of the cathedral that is yet to be , with its cluster of chapels , jeweled stonework , which come fresh from the mason 's hands , and in a year have taken on the soft texture of age .  | St. John 's grows slowly ? not , perhaps , by the standard of the medieval cathedrals , but very slowly by comparison with railway terminals and aqueducts . It has been twenty years in the building , and for half of that time the sole visible result was an enormous arch of granite , now hidden within the choir , but then standing bare to the sky . When the last touch to the last tower of the finished cathedral is given , I doubt if the effect of the massed structure on the observer then living can compare with the huge , gaunt span which so many of us can recall , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river in what must always remain the greatest show on earth . There was a tradition among us of the first years of the University on the hill , who found the great arch watching over the city every morning , and left it on guard at night , that St. John 's grew so slowly because it was being built do a cash basis . We had it that every Sunday , at services in the cathedral vaults , the plate was passed round , and when the trustees had counted the proceeds they would authorize a slab or two for the arch , a bit of buttress work , or perhaps only order a couple of barrels of lime . We used to jest about it . Matter-of-fact persons observed that the arch grew so deliberately because the builders waited for the mortar to settle . Irreverent sophomores suggested that the builders might be waiting for the trustees to settle . And yet , for all our flippancy about the arch , it entered into our sophomore souls as deeply as anything could be expected to go into that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pious and irreverent Middle Ages . To-day it very often occurs to me that  | St. John 's , in its slow rise , should be a real and visible comfort to a great many people who read newspaper and magazine articles about the swirling tides of change and What is Wrong with the Church . If the editorial writers and the special contributors are right ? and it can not be that they are not ? the world as we know it to-day is crumbling to bits . The knell has sounded for institutionalism . The churches are already empty ; soon they will be in ruins . How , then , in view of the imminent dissolution of Christianity and its replacement by social welfare , in view of the disappearance of the churches and their replacement by the moving-picture theaters , can sober , successful men of business like the trustees of St. John 's be engaged in so speculative a business as putting up a cathedral that may take fifty years to finish ? Can it be that , after all , when the cathedral is finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That , apparently , is the presumption upon which the trustees are acting ; and , being successful men of business , perhaps there is something , after all , in what they believe . Perhaps this recognizable world , with its institutionalism , is not crumbling as fast as the newspapers say , or possibly the very business of building a cathedral helps to stay the process of decay . At any rate , here is the fact for timid conservatives to take comfort in , that Messrs . Morgan and Belmont are building St. John 's with apparently as much confidence in the future as though they were building a subway or an extension to the Catskill Aqueduct . In London has just been finished a great Catholic cathedral , and in Paris work is still progressing upon Sacre Coeur on the top of Montmartre . It is all very complex and beyond the scope of a mere impressionist . A noble Roman basilica and twelve massive factory buildings of brick , built like all model industrial structures for kight and air , make up Columbia University proper as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way on 120th Street , and Barnard College for Women , on the other ; ide of Broadway . No modern college president would object to having his establishment referred to as an educational plant , and that is the one impression of Columbia campus which deepens with time ? a great group of utilitarian work-shops devoted to the generation of  | power and light as the president 's commencement address might describe it . This , however , is not the first impression which the visitor will carry away if he enters the campus from the main approach on 116th Street up the magnificent flight of steps that rise in a succession of granite waves , checkered with red-brick tapestry , to the Low Library . More than the classic lines of the Library , with its colonnade and dome , this stairway of magnificent proportions justifies the adjective Roman which it has so often received . The dome , the colonnade , the monumental granite terrace are the things that hit you first and hit you hard ; and the visitor who has climbed the stairs and strolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hasty tour of the subsidiary buildings will remember chiefly the Library . As first impressions go , that is right enough . It is a pity only that so few out-of-town visitors are granted the opportunity to see the Library at its best ; and that is at night when the great lamps glow out between the columns and give just enough light to splash the noble facade with gleams of white and pale yellows and shadow . The effect then is as far away as you can imagine from modernism and industrial efficiency . South Court and the Library at night are like the weird marble dreams of Arnold Boecklin in his haunted isles . Night and Mr. Edison in combination have outfitted New York with a form of beauty that no other city can show ; the Singer Tower , Broadway during the . theater hours , and the Library on University Heights are the three local triumphs of their collaboration . But when one comes back to the campus again and again after spending three years upon its brick pavements , crosses it hurriedly on the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more leisurely in the late afternoon home from the subway , and again at night to and from the theater , the Library , as the embodiment of the spirit of the University , shrinks into the background , and it is the great rectangles of reddish-brown brick that impose themselves as the real university ; they are so obviously useful , so plainly capable of containing the five thousand students who are listed in the catalogue , so clearly intent on business . Once the architects had given the Library the place of honor in the center of the campus , with a splendid wastefulness of space , the real workshops were distributed with the most rigorous deference to economy and order . Symmetry runs riot . Two halls on the east front of the campus facing Amsterdam Avenue balance two halls on the west front facing Broadway . Schermerhorn Hall , in the northeast corner , balances Havemeyer Hall in the northwest corner . The Romanesque Chapel on the east of the Library balances in general design and dimensions Earl Hall on the west flank . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ von Mackensen . Where the symmetry of the scheme is broken , it is not the fault of the architects , but a lack of funds . Here and there are gaps , waiting spaces . When the necessary number of rich alumni have died and the architect 's blue-prints are completely realized , the geometrical scheme will be perfect . That is why there may conceivably be Columbia graduates disloyal enough to hope that the money will not be available for a good many years to come . For then charming bits of anachronism and assymmetry like the grim , dirty block of East Hall , which was once Bloomingdale Insane Asylum , and the humble , red-brick dwellings which were once presumably the residences of the principal keeper and the chief physician of Bloqmingdale and are now the Faculty Club and the dean 's offices , may survive to frustrate the geometrical designs of the University trustees . Things are still very new . Since Columbia came up to Morningside Heights there has neither been enough time nor weather to " soften outlines . The ivy is only beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , romance has come in with the appearance of green quadrangles and obscure corners and terraces that overhang the trolley-lines , but seem very far away from them indeed . From the summit of South Court , at the entrance to the Library , the brick plaza , which is the campus proper , runs north for a distance of two city blocks  | and makes a sheer drop of some thirty feet to the Grove . The University begins on the south like the Roman Forum , and ends on the north like Oxford . The old trees in the Grove have been spared . The gardeners have done their work with the lawns . Here , indeed , you might imagine philosophers strolling about under the trees in high discourse . Only the Grove to-day is not given up to philosophers . The Ph.D . ' s do not stroll , meditating their theses . It would be rather hard to meditate in the open air on the Myxosporida Found in the Gall Bladders of Fishes from the Eastern Coast of Canada . The undergraduate uses the Grove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the subway or his boarding-house . By reading the president 's commencement address and the University Quarterly you will undoubtedly find the various points at which Columbia touches life . But neither the president nor the Quarterly mentions the Grove as the point at which the University comes into closest contact with the outside world . For in the Grove there are trees and grass , and where there are trees there are sure to be squirrels , and where there are squirrels and grass there are nurses with baby-carriages and little ones toddling after the squirrels or putting their dolls to bed just outside the windows of the Zoological Museum . The real Peripatetics on Morningside range from two years to five . Whatever may be thought of the president 's attitude toward his faculty , his policy to the baby-carts in the Grove is most liberal . There may be some rule restricting the privileges of the Grove to the offspring of faculty members , or , at least , to children whose parents can show a college degree . But if there is such a rule , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result , the university squirrels are uncommonly fat and lazy , fastidious in their food , and tame to the point where they scurry through the massive iron palings which inclose the Grove , across the asphalt of moth Street , to perch on the very steps of Teachers College . The squirrels and babies are on equal terms of intimacy with the great bronze Pan who lolls at his ease of twelve feet or more over a water-basin in the corner of the Grove , his back turned disdainfully on the Amsterdam Avenue cars . From his easy position at the edge of the fountain , Pan has observed the academic processions filing into the gymnasium , which is also the university assembly hall , has overheard the sonorous presidential formula conferring honorary degrees on several hundred distinguished citizens , and has apparently remained content without a degree or a diploma ; at least , Pan 's smile would indicate that . He was never one for select company . In the absence of fauns and dryads , the children , the squirrels , and the nurse-girls are good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule to himself ; but there is the night of the Senior Dance , when Chinese lanterns gleam among the trees , and there are the warm nights of the Summer Session when Ben Greet or the Coburn Players give " As You Like It , " with poetry and romance , but without the scenery and the punch that have kept for Shakespeare his precarious foothold on the Broadway stage . The atmosphere on Columbia campus , and for that matter on Morningside Heights , to the extent that the Heights are shaped by the campus , is feminine . A great many more women than men climb and descend the Library steps , traverse the brick plaza around which the Halls cluster , lounge in the Grove , or hustle across Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue to lose themselves in the dormitories and the apartment-house jungles beyond . For that matter , one would never suppose from a brief visit to the campus that several thousand young men are there concentrated within the space of seven or eight acres . In the few male figures which you discern here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you associate with youth on the college campus , loitering under trees , sprawling on fences and benches and stairways . Rather you see young men engaged in going rapidly from one place to another , from the Library to the " dorms , " from Philosophy Hall to Schermerhorn . But they are singles , or little groups , hardly enough to stock a fresh-water college in the Middle West , not to say a university : It is like Somewhere in France . You  | know that a male army is hidden hereabout , though the trenches and the communication lines are invisible . But the women are everywhere . Why this striking feminine predominance ? It can not be that the young men are all grinding away at their books in their rooms or in the Library , while the women go in for sunshine and leisure . The balance of scholarship and application is the other way . The reason is , I suppose , that the young women from Barnard and Teachers College are compelled to do a great deal of walking because of scattered class-rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early days of Columbia on the Heights the workshops were half as many as they are now , and of libraries there was only one . The men in the College , the Mines men , the lawyers , took their lectures in half a dozen buildings , perhaps , and the campus between hours was as lively a place as the Broad Street curb . But Columbia has grown , and , like some of the lower biological forms , has propagated by splitting up . The campus proper has spilled over across 116th Street to South Field , where Hamilton Hall , the college proper , with its own library , lying close to the long rows of tall , brick dormitories , has drained off virtually the entire undergraduate body . Only the Gym in the Grove , and Earl Hall with its forums and cenacles , form a connecting link between the undergraduates and the old campus . Among the postgraduate schools there has been the same process of decentralization . The lawyers who for many years were cooped up in spare rooms in the Low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . The architects have their own library . There is Earl Hall for student activities . There is the Chapel . Conditions are different now from what they were fifteen years ago , when chapel attendance was not quite a monster mass-meeting . Services were then held in the amphitheater of Schermerhorn Hall . In the main lobby of Schermerhorn , the skeleton of a mastodon faced the visitor as he entered . I believe it still does . One day the rumor spread that the mastodon had been knocked over that morning in the mad rush to chapel . The story proved to be untrue . A dozen was a fair morning 's attendance . The last time I visited the old amphitheater was two or three years ago , when M. Bergson lectured on Creative Evolution ? or was it the Phenomena of Laughter ? ( my French is not perfect ) ? to crowded benches . His audience easily represented a full month 's chapel attendance . I understand that things are different to-day , and this shows once more , as in the case of St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not been as rapid as some people think . Additional evidence on this point is supplied by the great new Seminary on Broadway , diagonally across from the University , stretching a solid front of four hundred feet of lovely Gothic detail , which , in the mass , however , I find rather disappointing . When the eye has followed that facade for a city block , it has had enough . The masonry ceases to flow and begins to sprawl . Imagine a stretch of pointed arches , windows , embrasures , moldings , and carven lace-work which it would take Ted Meredith fifteen seconds to pass at top speed . But the detail is exquisite . Your modern architect apparently needs not wait for time to give the sanctifying touch to his stone and masonry . Give him money enough , and he will find the right kind of stone to take on not only the form but the patina of the old monuments . A noble archway does help to break the monotony of the enormous front . It leads into a great quadrangle , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bold terra-cotta glare of the ten-story apartment-houses , with three baths , on Claremont Avenue , can destroy . Long cloisters stretch on two sides of the quadrangle , and here again the freshness of the brass-work , the gleam of new varnish , is not altogether destructive of the religious spirit , though I am aware that on several occasions the question has been raised whether there is such a spirit at the Union Theological Seminary to destroy . This is not a controversial article , but I maintain that in a house so beautiful there must be a worthy soul indwelling . For that matter , on Sunday people unquestionably do pass through the gate- way , cross the quadrangle , and enter the Seminary Chapel , in size a metropolitan church , which forms the southwest corner of the great inclosure . The organ peals out nobly , there is the sound of hymns , and outside on the walks and in the cloisters the young of Morningside Heights walk about in Sunday habiliments and with their parents , the same young who on secular days disport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subdued by Sunday clothes to an appropriate demeanor ; subdued , but not excessively . With the Seminary , as with the University buildings , you get the impression of vast . uninhabited spaces . There are close neighbors of the Seminary who can hardly recall seeing any one entering the great building or coming out whom you would mark for a theological student . If one looks for an immediately visible influence of the University , the Cathedral , and the Seminaries upon the outward aspect of the Heights , he is likely to be disappointed . The apartment houses on Broadway and Morningside Drive are almost as ornate as they are farther down-town or up-town , the predilection for classical names , in the style of Pullman , is just as emphatic . If you look for mass effects , there is little about the aspect of the neighborhood once you turn your back on the campus , to show that you are.in a peculiar cultural atmosphere . But if you are on the watch for subtler things , they are there . Inside of the ornate apartment houses an observant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a normal sound in Morningside interiors . There is a high average of young faces in the lobbies , the student overflow from the University dormitories . And if you are curious and mannerless enough to peep at the addresses on the envelopes which elevator-boys have a habit of posting on the walls of the elevator cage , you will see stamped envelopes from book-publishing firms , from magazine subscription offices , from teachers ' agencies , travel bureaus , symphony orchestras , independent little theaters ? all testifying clearly to the presence of a select cultural population . The signs are more emphatic in the shop windows . The haberdashery exposed is of an aggressive pattern and shade that testify plainly to the presence of a large undergraduate population . The little specialty shops for women indicate in the same way the presence of a large female population which is too busy to shop down - town . The eating - places swarm on every side , one more proof of a large bachelor environment . The eating-shops are small , but they strive for and attain artistic effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an actual spinning-wheel in the window , all of which indicates something better than the tastes that are satisfied at Childs ' . On the news-stands the piles of ten-cent magazines are not much taller than the thirty-five-cent magazines , and the Evening Post makes quite a respectable showing against the yellow Journals . The nature of the picture post-cards on sale in the drug - stores is an infallible index . They do not go in for the robust comedy of sitting on freshly painted park benches . They are truly informative pictures ? the University buildings , of course ; Riverside , Grant 's Tomb ? in short , the kind one sends home from Paris instead of from Long Beach . The popular picture-card on Morningside Heights is indicative of the ethnology of the place . With the exception of certain streets in Greenwich Village , no other section of New York shows so large a percentage of the old American race ? to say Anglo-Saxon would be inviting needless controversy . The University has drawn thousands of students from all parts of the country , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the picture-cards of Grant 's Tomb and St. John 's go out in large numbers . The physical traits of the older racial type are more pronounced in the women than in the men ? tall , spare , graceful women with high-strung , almost painfully clear-cut features , and the prematurely gray hair which is the sign of the upper-class American woman who is not of the idle classes . Especially in July , when the summer vacation brings thousands of school-teachers from the great hinterland , Morningside is strongly marked with profiles and accents that are decidedly not of the average New York .  |
