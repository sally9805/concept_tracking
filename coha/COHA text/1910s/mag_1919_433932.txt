It must be borne in mind by American readers that Lord Haldane , then Mr. Haldane , joined the Cabinet of Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman as Secretary of State for War , in 1905 , and continued to hold that portfolio under Mr. Asquith , after Sir Henry 's death , until 1912 , having been raised to the peerage in 1911 in recognition of his eminent services . In 1912 he became Lord Chancellor , retiring from that high office on the formation of I he first Coalition Ministry in 1915 . ? THE EDITORS . MANY things that happened in the years just before 1914 , as well as the events of the Great War itself , are still too close to permit of our studying them in their full context . But before much time has passed the historians will have accumulated material that will overflow their libraries , and their hands will remain occupied for generations to come . At this moment all that can safely be attempted is that actual observers should set down what they have themselves observed . For there has rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not evidence ' ought to be more sternly insisted on . If I now venture to set down what follows in these pages , it is because I had certain opportunities for forming a judgment at first hand for myself . I am not referring to the circumstance that for a brief period I once , long ago , lived the life of a student at a German university , or that I was frequently in Germany in the years that followed . Nor do I mean that I have tried to explore German habits of reflection , as they may be studied in the literature of Germany . Other people have done all these things more thoroughly and more extensively than I. What I do mean is that from the end of 1905 to the summer of 1912 I had special opportunities for direct observation of quite another kind . During that period I was Secretary of State for War in Great Britain , and from 1912 to April , 1915 , I was the holder of another office and a member of the British Cabinet . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the military organization that would be required to ensure , as far as was practicable , against risk , should those strenuous efforts fail into which Sir Edward Grey , as he then was , had thrown his strength . He was endeavoring with all his might to guard the peace of Europe from danger . As be and I had for many years been on terms of close intimacy , it was not unnatural that he should ask me to do what I could by helping in some of the diplomatic work which was his , as well as by engaging in my own special task . Indeed , the two phases of activity could hardly be wholly separable . I was not in Germany after May , 191e , for the duties of Lord Chancellor , which office I then entered on , made it unconstitutional for me to leave the United Kingdom , save under such exceptional conditions as were conceded by the King and the Cabinet when , in the autumn of 1913 , I made a brief , yet to me ever-memorable , visit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while War Minister , I paid , ' on the invitation of the German Emperor , a visit to him at Berlin , to which city I went on after previously staying with King Edward at Marienbad , where he and the then Prime Minister , Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman , were resting . While at Berlin I saw much of the Emperor , and I also saw certain of his ministers , notably Prince von Billow , Herr von Tchirsky , and General von Einem , the first being at that time Chancellor , and the last two being respectively the Foreign and War Ministers . I was invited to look over for myself the organization of the German War Office , which I wished to study for purposes of reform at home ; and this I did in some detail , in company with an expert adviser from my personal staff , Colonel Ellison , my military private secretary , who accompanied me on this journey . There the authorities explained to us the general nature of the organization for rapid mobilization which had been developed under the great von @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this organization was , in its general features , no secret in Germany , although it was somewhat unfamiliar in Anglo-Saxon countries ; and it interested my adviser and myself intensely . At that time there was an active militarist party in Germany , which of course was not wholly pleased at the friendly reception which we met with from the Emperor and from crowds in the streets of Berlin . We were well aware of the activity of this party . But it stood then unmistakably for a minority , and I formed the opinion that those who wanted Germany to remain at peace , quite as much as to be strong , had at least an excellent chance of keeping their feet . I realized , and had done so for years past , that it was not merely because of the beaux yeux of foreign peoples that Germany desired to maintain good relations all round . She had become fully conscious of a growing superiority in the application to industry of scientific knowledge , and in power founded on it to organize her resources ; and her rulers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by these means in the peaceful penetration of the world . I had personally for some time been busy in pushing the then somewhat coldly received claims for a better system of education , higher and technical as well as elementary , among my own countrymen , and had met with some success in pressing the establishment of teaching universities and of technical colleges , such as the new Imperial College of Science and Technology , at South Kensington . Of these we had very substantially increased the number during the eight years which preceded my visit to Berlin ; but I had learned from visits of inspection to Germany that much more remained to be done before we could secure our commercial and industrial position against the unhasting but unresting efforts of our formidable competitor . As to the German people outside of official circles and the universities , I thought of them what I think of them now . They were very ' much like our own people , except in one thing . This was that they were trained simply to obey , and to carry out whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during numerous unofficial tours in Germany , to wander about incognito , and to smoke and drink beer with the peasants and the people whenever I could get the chance . What impressed me was the small part they had in directing their own government , and the little they knew about what it was doing . There was a general disposition to accept , as a definition of duty which must not be questioned , whatever they were told to do by the V orstand . It is this habit of mind , dating back to the days of Frederick the Great , with only occasional and brief interruptions , which has led many people to think that the German people at large have in them ' a double dose of original sin . ' Even when their soldiers have been exceptionally brutal in methods of warfare , I do not think that this is so . The habit of mind which prevails is that of always looking to the rulers for orders , and the brutality has been that enjoined ? in accordance with its own military policy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the General Staff of Germany , a body before whose injunctions even the Emperor , so far as my observation goes , has always bowed . But I must now return to my formal visit to Berlin in the autumn of 1906 . I was , as I have already said , everywhere cordially welcomed , and at the end the heads of the German army entertained me at a dinner in the War Office , at which the War Minister presided , and there was present , among others , the chief of the German General Staff . They were all friendly . I do not think that my impression waswrong that even the responsible heads of the army were then looking almost entirely to ' peaceful penetration , ' with only moral assistance from the prestige attaching to the possession of great armed forces in reserve . Our business in the United Kingdom was , therefore , to see that we were prepared for perils which might unexpectedly arise out of this policy , and not less , by developing our educational and industrial organization , to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keen competition in peaceful arts . One thing that seemed to me essential for the preservation of good relations was that cordial and frequent intercourse between the people of the two countries should be encouraged and developed . I set myself in my speeches to avoid all expressions which might be construed as suggesting a critical attitude on our part , or a failure to recognize the existence of peaceful ideas among what was then , as I still think , a large majority of the people of Germany . The attitude of some newspapers in England , and still more that of the Chauvinist minority in Germany itself , made this a somewhat difficult task . But there were good people in those days in Germany as well as in England , and the United States might be counted on as likely to cooperate in discouraging friction . Meanwhile there was the chance that the course of this policy might be interrupted by some event which we could not control . A conversation with the then chief of the German General Staff , General von Moltke , the nephew of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not really look with any pleasurable military expectation to the results of a war with the United Kingdom alone . It would , he observed to me , be in his opinion a long and possibly indecisive war , and must result in much of the overseas trade of both countries passing to a tertius gaudens , by which he meant the United States . I had little doubt that what he said to me on this occasion represented his real opinion . But I had in my mind the apprehension of an emergency of a different nature . Germany was more likely to attack France than ourselves . The Emperor had told me that , although he was trying to develop good relations with France , he was finding it difficult . This seemed to me ominous . The paradox presented itself that a war with Germany in which we were alone would be easier than a war in which France was attacked along with us ; for if Germany succeeded in overrunning France , she might establish naval bases on the northern Channel ports of that country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the possible aid of the submarines , long-range guns , and air-machines of the future , interfere materially with our naval position in the Channel and our naval defenses against invasion . I knew , too , that the French Government was apprehensive . In the historical speech which Sir Edward Grey made on August 3 , 1914 , the day before the British Government directed Sir Edward Goschen , our Ambassador in Berlin , to ask for his passports , he informed the House of Commons that as early as January , 1906 , the French Government , after the Morocco difficulty , had drawn his attention to the international situation . It had informed him that it considered the danger of an attack on France by Germany to be a real one , and had inquired whether , in the event of an unprovoked attack , Great Britain would think that she had so much at stake as to make her willing to join in resisting it . If this were to be even a possible attitude for Great Britain , the French Government had intimated to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take place between the General Staff of France and the newly created General Staff of Great Britain , as to the form which military cooperation in resisting invasion of the northern portions of France might best assume . We had a great navy and the French had a great army . But our navy ' could not operate on land , and the French army , although large , was not so large as that which Germany , with her superior resources in population , commanded . Could we then reconsider our military organization , so that we might be able rapidly to dispatch , if we ever thought it necessary in our own interests , say , 100,000 men in a well-formed army , not to invade Belgium , which no one thought of doing , but to guard the French frontier of Belgium in case the German army should seek to enter France in that way . If the German attack were made farther south , where the French chain of modern fortresses had rendered their defensive positions strong , the French army would then be able , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite Belgium , to guard the southern frontier . Sir Edward Grey consulted the Prime Minister , Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman , the Chancellor of the Exchequer , Mr. Asquith , and myself as War Minister , and I was instructed , in January , 1906 , a month after assuming office , to take the examination of the question in hand . This occurred in the middle of the general election which was then in progress . I went at once to London and summoned the heads of the British General Staff and saw the French military attach ? , Colonel Huguet , a man of sense and ability . I became aware at once that there was a new army problem . It was , how to mobilize and concentrate at a place of assembly to be opposite the Belgian frontier , a force calculated as adequate ( with the assistance of Russian pressure in the East ) to make up for the inadequacy of the French armies for their great task of defending the entire French frontier from Dunkirk down to Belfort ? or even farther south , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But an investigation of a searching character presently revealed great deficiencies in the British military organization of those days . We had never contemplated the preparation of armies for warfare of the Continental type . The older generals had not been trained to this problem . We had , it was true , excellent troops in India and else .. where . These were required as outposts for Imperial defense . As they had to serve for long periods and to be thoroughly trained , they had to be professional soldiers , engaged to serve in most cases for seven years with the colors and afterwards for five in the reserve . They were highly trained men , and there was a good reserve of them at home . But that reserve was not organized in the great self-contained divisions which would be required for fighting against armies organized for rapid action on modern Continental principles . Its formations in peacetime were not those which would be required in such a war . There was in addition a serious defect in the artillery organization which would have prevented more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of fact ) being quickly placed on a war footing . The transport and supply and the medical services were as deficient as the artillery . In short , the close investigation we made at that time disclosed that it was , under the then existing circumstances , not possible to put in the field more than about 80,000 men , and even these only after an interval of over two months , which would be required for conversion of our isolated units into the new war-formations of an army fit to take the field against the German first line of active corps . The French naturally thought that a machine so slow-moving would be of little use to them . They might have been destroyed before it could begin to operate effectively . Both she and Germany had organized on the basis that modem Continental warfare had become a high science . Hitherto we had not , and it was only our younger generals who had even studied this science . There was therefore nothing for it but to attempt a complete revolution in the organization of the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized in September , 1906 , and its organization was shortly afterwards developed so as to extend to the entire Empire , as soon as a conference had taken place with the ministers of the Dominions early in the following year . The outcome was a complete recasting , which , after three years ' work , made it practicable rapidly to mobilize , not only 100,000 , but 160,000 men ; to transport them , with the aid of the navy , to a place of concentration which had been settled between the staffs of France and Britain ; and to have them at their appointed place within twelve days , an interval based on what the Germany army required on its side for a corresponding concentration . All the arrangements for this were worked out by the end of 1910 . Both Sir John French and Sir Douglas Haig took an active part in the work . Behind the first-line army so organized , a second-line army of larger size , though far less trained , and so designed that it could be expanded , was organized . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consisting in time of peace of fourteen divisions of infantry and artillery and fourteen brigades of cavalry , with the appropriate medical , sanitary , transport , and other auxiliary services . Those serving in this second-line army were civilians , and of course much less disciplined than the officers and men of the first line . Its primary function was home defense , but its members were encouraged to undertake for service abroad , if necessary ; and in point of fact a large part of this army fought in France , Flanders , and the East soon after the beginning of the war , in great measure making up by their intelligence for the shortness of their training . To say , therefore , that we were caught unprepared is not accurate . Compulsory service in a period of peace was out of the question for us . Moreover , it would have taken at least thirty years to organize , and meanwhile we should have been weaker than without it . We had studied the situation and had done the only thing that , after full deliberation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in our navy and its tradition . Our secondary contribution was a small army fashioned to fulfil a scientifically measured function . It was of course a very small army , but it had a scientific organization , on the basis of which a great expansion was possible . After all , what we set ourselves to accomplish we did accomplish . If the margin by which a just sufficient success was attained in the early days of the war seems to-day narrow , the reason of the narrow margin lay large-i ly in the unprepared condition of the armies of Russia , on which we and France had reckoned for rapid cooperation . Anyhow , we fulfilled our contract , for at eleven o'clock on Monday morning , August 3 , 1914 , we mobilized without a hitch the whole of the Expeditionary Force , amounting to six divisions and nearly two cavalry divisions , /and began its transport over the Channel when war was declared thirty-six hours later . We also at the same time successfully mobilized the Territorial force and other units , the whole amounting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its war stations , and there was no delay at all in putting what we had prepared into operation . I speak of this with direct knowledge , , for as the Prime Minister , who was holding temporarily the seals of the War Department , was overwhelmed with business , he asked me , though Lord Chancellor , to go to the War Office and give directions for the mobilization of the machinery with which I was so familiar ; and I did so on the morning of Monday , August 3 , and a day later handed it over , in working order , to Lord Kitchener . nr I now return to what was the main object of British foreign policy between 1905 and 1914 , the prevention of the danger of any outbreak with Germany . Sir Edward Grey , as he then was , worked strenuously with this object . If France was overrun , our island security would be at least diminished , and he had therefore , in addition to his anxiety to avert a general war , a direct national interest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and France . Ever since the mutilation which the latter country had suffered , as the outcome of the War of 1870 , she had felt sore , and her relations with Germany were not easy . But she did not seek a war of revenge . It would have been too full of risk even if she had not desired peace , the Franco-Russian Dual Alliance notwithstanding . The notion of an encirclement of Germany , excepting in defense against aggression by Germany herself , existed only in the minds of nervous Germans . Still , there was suspicion , and the question was , how to get rid of it . I have already referred to the visit I paid to the Emperor at Berlin in the autumn of 1906 . He invited me to a review which he held of his troops there , and in the course of it rode up to the carriage in which I was seated and said , ' A splendid machine I have in this army , Mr. Haldane ; now is n't it so ? And what could I do without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French ? But the French are your allies ? are they not ? so I beg pardon . ' I shook my head and smiled deprecatingly , and replied that , were I in His Majesty 's place , I should in any case feel safe from attack with the possession of this machine , and that for my own part I enjoyed being behind it much more than if I had to be in front of it . Next day at the Schloss he talked to me fully and cordially . What follows I extract from the record I made after the conversation in my diaries , which were kept by desire of King Edward , and which were printed by the government on my return to London . He spoke of the Anglo-French Entente . He said that it would be wrong to infer that he had any critical thought about our entente with France . On the contrary he believed that it might even facilitate good relations between France and Germany . He wished for these good relations , and was taking steps through gentlemen of high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of French territory would he ever covet . Alsace and Lorraine originally had been German , and now even the least German of the two , Lorraine , bemuse it preferred a monarchy to a republic , was welcoming him enthusiastically whenever he went there . That he should have gone to Tangier , where both English and French welcomed him , was quite natural . He desired no quarrel , and the whole fault was Delcasse 's , who had wanted to pick a quarrel and bring England into it . I told the Emperor that , if he would allow me to speak my mind freely , I would do so . He assented , and I said to him that his attitude had caused great uneasiness in England , and that this , and not any notion of forming a tri partite alliance of France , Russia , and England against him , was the reason of the feeling there had been . We were bound by no military alliance . As for our entente , some time since we had had difficulties with France over Newfoundland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement ( gates Geschaft ) about these complicated matters of detail , and had simply carried out our word to France . He said that he had no criticism to make on this , except that , if we had told him so early , there would have been no misunderstanding . Things were better now , but we had not always been pleasant to him and ready to meet him . His army was for defense , not for offense . As to Russia , he had no Himalayas between him and Russia , more was the pity . Now what about our Two-Power standard ? ( All this was said with earnestness , but in a friendly way , the Emperor laying his finger on my shoulder as he spoke . Sometimes the conversation was in German , but more often in English . ) I said that our fleet was like His Majesty 's army . It was of the Wesen of the nation , and the Two-Power standard , while it might be rigid and so awkward , was a way of maintaining a deep-seated national tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmly as a Conservative . Both countries were increasing in wealth , ? ours , like Germany , very rapidly , ? and if Germany built , we must build . But , I added , there was an excellent opportunity for cooperation in other things . I instanced international free-trade developments , which would smooth other relations . The Emperor agreed . He was convinced that free trade was the true policy for Germany also , but Germany could not go so quickly here as England had gone . I referred to Friedrich List 's great book as illustrating how military and geographical considerations had affected matters for Germany in this connection . The Emperor then spoke of Chamberlain 's policy of Tariff Reform , and said that it had caused him anxiety . I replied that with care we might avoid any real had feeling over trade . The undeveloped markets of the world were enormous , and we wanted no more of the surface of the globe than we had got . The Emperor 's reply was that what he sought after was not territory but trade-expansion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted anything it must concentrate and act from within the sphere of its concentration . We then spoke of the fifty millions sterling per annum of chemical trade which Germany had got away from us . I said that this was thoroughly justified as the result of the practical application of high German science . That , ' said he , ' I delight to think , because it is legitimate and to the credit of my people . ' I agreed , and said that similarly we had got the best of the world 's shipbuilding . Each nation had something to learn . The Emperor then passed to the topic of the Hague Conference , trusting that disarmament would not be proposed . If so , he could not go in . I observed that the word ' disarmament ' was perhaps unfortunately chosen . The best testimony , ' said the Emperor , ' to my earnest desire for peace is that I have had no war , though I should have had war if I had not earnestly striven to avoid it . ' Throughout the conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Emperor was cordial and agreeable . Ile expressed the wish that more English ministers would visit Wenn , and that he might see more of our Royal Family . I left the palace at 3.30 P.M. , having gone there at one . On another day during this visit Prince von Billow , who was then Chancellor , called on me . I was out , but found him later at the Schloss and had a conversation with hint . He said to me that both the Emperor and himself were thoroughly aware of the desire of King Edward and his government to maintain the new relations with France in their integrity , and that , in the best German opinion , this was no obstacle to building up close relations with Germany also . I said that this was the view held on our side , too , and that the only danger lay in trying to force everything at once . Too great haste was to be deprecated . He said that he entirely agreed , and quoted Prince Bismarck , who had laid it down that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire to heat it . I said that , none the less , frequent and cordial interchanges of view were very important , and that not even the smallest matters , should be neglected . He alluded with satisfaction to my personal relations with the German Ambassador in London , Count Metternich . I begged him , if there were any small matters which were too minute to take up officially , but which seemed unsatisfactory , to let me know of them in a private capacity through Count Metternich . This I did because I had discovered some soreness at restrictions which had been placed on the attendance of German military officers at manoeuvres in England , and I had found that there had been some reprisals . I did not refer to these , but said that I had the authority of the sovereign to give assistance to German officers who were sent over to the manoeuvres to study them . I said that while our army was small , compared with theirs , it had had great experience in the conduct of small expeditions , and that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke of the navy . It was natural that with the increase of German commerce Germany should wish to increase her fleet , ? from a sea-police point of view , ? but that they had neither the wish , nor , having regard to the strain their great army put on their resources , the power to build against Great Britain . I said that the best opinion in England fully understood this attitude , and that we did not in the least misinterpret their recent progress , nor would he misinterpret our resolve to maintain , for purely defensive purposes , our navy at a Two-Power standard . Some day , I said , there might be rivalry , but I thought that we might assume that , if it ever happened , it would not be for many years , and that our policy for the present was strongly for Free Trade , so that , the more Germany exported to Great Britain and British possessions , the more we should export in exchange to her . He expressed himself pleased that I should say this , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' interchange of friendly communications in this spirit would produce a great development , and perhaps lead for both of us to pleasant relations with other powers also . ? There were during this visit in 1906 other conversations of which a record was preserved , but I have referred to the most important , and I will only mention , in concluding my account of these days in Berlin in September , 1906 , the talk I had with the Foreign Minister , Herr von Tchirsky , afterwards the German Ambassador at Vienna before the war , and reported as having been a fomenter of the Austrian outbreak against Serbia . He may have been anti-Slav and anti-Russian , but I did not find him , in the long conversation we had in 1906 , otherwise than sensible as regards France . I explained that my business in Berlin was merely with War-Office matters , and , even as regards these , quite unofficial . He said that there had been much tendency to misinterpret in both countries , but that things were now better . I might take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our desire to rest firmly on the arrangement we had made , were understood in Germany , and that it was realized that we were not likely to be able to build up anything with his own country which did not rest on this basis . But he thought , and the Emperor agreed , that the entente was no hindrance to all that was necessary between Germany and England , which was not an alliance but a thoroughly good business understanding . Some day we might come into conflict , if care was not taken ; but if care was taken , there was no need of it . I said that I believed this to be Sir Edward Grey 's view also , and that he was anxious to communicate with the German Government beforehand whenever there was a chance of German interests being touched . He went on to speak of the approaching Hague Conference , and of the difficulty Germany would have if asked to alter the proportion of her army to her population , a proportion which rested on a fundamental law . For Germany to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it would be a friendly act if we could devise some way out of a definite vote on reduction . Germany might well enter a conference to record and emphasize the improvement all round in international relations , the desirability of further developing this improvement , and the hope that with it the growth of armaments would cease . But he was afraid of the kind of initiative which was likely to come from America . The United States had no sympathy with European military and naval difficulties . I said that I thought that we too , as a government , were pledged to try to bring about something more definite than what he suggested as a limit , but that I would report what he had told me . He then passed to general topics . He was emphatic in his assurance that what Germany wanted was increase of commercial development . Let the nations avoid inflicting pin-pricks , and leave each other free to breathe the air . He said that he thought we might have opportunities of helping them to get the French into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed , and it was hard to transact business with them , for they made trouble over small points . On my return to London I sent to Herr von Tchirsky some English newspapers containing articles of a friendly tone , so far as the preservation of good relations was concerned . He replied in a letter from which I translate the material portion . I see with pleasure from the articles which Your Excellency has sent me for His Majesty , and from other expressions of public opinion in English newspapers , that in the leading Liberal papers of England a more friendly tone toward Germany is making itself apparent . You would have been able to derive the same impression from reading our newspapers , with the exception of a few Pan-German prints . Alas , papers like the Times , Morning Post , and Standard can not bring themselves to refrain from their attitude of dislike , and are always rejoicing in being suspicious of every action of the Imperial Government . They contribute in thisfashion appreciably to render weak the new tone of diminishing misunderstanding which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under these circumstances , it will be a long time before mutual understanding has grown up to the point at which it stood more than a century ago , and as you and I desire it in the well-understood interests of England and Germany , still I hope and am persuaded that the relations of the two governments will remain good : ry A year after the visit I had paid to Berlin , the Emperor came over to stay with King Edward at Windsor . This was in November , 1907 . The visit lasted several days , and I was present most of the time . The Emperor was accompanied by Baron von Schoen , who had become Foreign Minister of Prussia after having been Ambassador to the Court of Russia , and by General von Einem , the War Minister , whose inclusion in the invitation I had ventured to suggest to the King , as an acknowledgment of his civility to myself as War Minister when in Berlin . There were also at Windsor Count Metternich and several high military officers of the Emperor 's personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the War Minister I showed all the hospitality I could in London , and I received them officially at the War Office . But the really interesting incident of this visit , so far as I was concerned , took place at Windsor . The first evening of my visit there , just after his arrival in November , the Emperor took me aside , and said he was sorry that there was a good deal of friction over the Bagdad Railway , and that he did not know what we wanted as a basis for cooperation . I said that I could not answer for the Foreign Office , but that , speaking as War Minister , one thing I knew we wanted was a gate ' to protect India from troops coming down the new railway . He asked me what I meant by a gate , ' and I said that meant the control of the section which would come near to the Persian Gulf . ' I will give you the " gate , " ' replied the Emperor . I had no opportunity at the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation further , but I thought the answer too important not to be followed up . There were private theatricals after dinner , which lasted till nearly one o'clock in the morning . I was seated in the theatre of the Castle just behind the Emperor , and , as the company broke up , I went forward and asked him whether he really meant seriously that he was willing to give us the gate ' ; because , if he did mean it , I would go to London early , and see Sir Edward Grey at the Foreign Office . Next morning , about 7.30 o'clock , a helmeted guardsman , one of those whom the Emperor had brought over with him from Berlin , knocked loudly at the door and came into my bedroom , and said that he had a message from the Emperor . It was that he did mean what he had said the night before . I at once got up and caught a train for London . There I saw the Foreign Secretary , who , after taking time to think things over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The substance of it was that the British Government would be very glad to discuss the Emperor 's suggestion , but that it would be necessary , before making a settlement , to bring into the discussion France and Russia , whose interests also were involved . I was requested to sound the Emperor further . After telling King Edward of what was happening , I had a further conversation in Windsor Castle with the Emperor , who said that he feared that the bringing in of Russia particularly , not to speak of France , would cause difficulty ; but he asked Inc to come that night , after a performance that was to take place in the Castle theatre had ended , to his apartments , to a meeting to which he would summon the ministers he had brought with him . He took the memorandum whirls I had brought from London , a copy of which I had made for him in my own handwriting , so as to present it as the informal document it was intended to be . Just before dinner Baron von Schoen spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Emperor what had happened , and that the Emperor was wrong in thinking that the attempt to bring in Russia would lead to difficulty , because he , Baron von Schoen , when he was Ambassador to Russia , had already discussed the general question with its government , and had virtually come to an understanding . At the meeting that night we could therefore go on to negotiate . I attended the Emperor in his state rooms at the Castle at one o'clock in the morning , and sat smoking with him and his ministers for over two hours . His Foreign Minister and Count Metternich and the War Minister , von Einem , were present . I said that I felt myself an intruder , because it was very much like being present at a sitting of his Cabinet . He replied , ' Be a member of my Cabinet for the evening . ' I said that I was quite agreeable . They then engaged in a very animated conversation , some of them challenging the proposal of the Emperor to accept the British suggestions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with its notions of Teutonic autocracy . Count Metternich did not at all like what I suggested , that there should be a conference in Berlin on the subject of the Bagdad Railway between England , France , Russia , and Germany . In the end , but not until after much keen argument , the idea was accepted , and the Emperor directed von Schoen to go next morning to London and make an official proposal to Sir Edward Grey . This was carried out , and the preliminary details were discussed between von Schoen and Sir Edward at the Foreign Office . Some weeks afterward difficulties were raised from Berlin . Germany said that she was ready to discuss with the British Government the question of the terminal portion of the railway , but she did not desire to bring the other two powers into that discussion , because the conference would probably fail and accentuate the differences between her and the other powers . The matter thus came to an end . It was , I think , a great pity , because I have reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bagdad Railway question could have been settled , one great obstacle in the way of reconciling German with French and English interests would have disappeared . I came to the conclusion afterward that it was due to Prince von Billow that the proposal had come to an untimely end . Whether he did not wish for an expanded entente ; whether the feeling was strong in Germany that the Bagdad Railway had become a specially German concern and should not be shared ; or what other reason he may have had , I do not know ; but it was from Berlin , after the Emperor 's return there at the end of November , 1907 , that the negotiations were finally blocked . Although these negotiations had no definite result , they assisted in promoting increasing frankness between the two Foreign Offices , and other things went with more smoothness . Sir Edward Grey kept France and Russia informed of all we did , and he was also very open with the Germans . Until well on in 1911 all went satisfactorily . In the early part of that year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had by that time succeeded to the throne . I had ventured to propose to the King that during the Emperor 's visit I should , as War Minister , give a luncheon to the generals who were on his staff . But when the Emperor heard of this , he sent a message that he would like to come and lunch with me himself , and to meet people whom otherwise he might not see . I acted on my own discretion , and when he came to luncheon at my house in Queen Anne 's Gate , I had a somewhat widely selected party of about a dozen to meet him . For it included not only Lord Morley , Lord Kitchener , and Lord Curzon , whom he was sure to meet elsewhere , but Mr. Ramsay Macdonald , who was then leading the Labor Party , Admiral Sir Arthur Wilson , our greatest naval commander , Lord Moulton , Mr. Edmund Gosse , Mr. Sargent , Mr. Spender , the editor of the W estminister Gazette , and others representing varied types of British opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all went with smoothness . He had a great reception in London . But enthusiasm about him was somewhat dampecrwhen , in July , 1911 , not long after his return to Germany , he sent the afterwards famous warship Panther to Agadir . The French were naturally alarmed , and the situation which had become so promising was overcast . Our naval arrangements and our new military organization were ready , and our mobilization plans were fairly complete , as the German General Staff knew from their military attache . But the point was , how to avoid an outbreak , and to get rid of the feeling and friction to which the Agadir crisis was giving rise . Our growing good relations were temporarily clouded . In the winter , after the actual crisis had been got over , there was evidence of continuing ill-feeling in Germany , and the suspicion in London did not diminish . In January , 1912 , an informal message was given by the Emperor to Sir Ernest Cassel , for transmission , if possible , through one of my colleagues to the Foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but learned shortly afterward that it was to the effect that the Emperor was concerned at the state of feeling that had arisen in both countries , and thought that the most hopeful method of improving matters would be that the Cabinet of St. James 's should exchange views directly with the Cabinet of Berlin . For this course there was a good deal to be said . The peace had indeed been preserved , but , as Herr von BethmannHollweg told me later on , not without effort . Germany 's attitude toward France had seemed menacing . The British Government had done its utmost to avert a breach , but its sympathy was naturally opposed to the language used in Germany , the spirit of which seemed to us to have in it an aggressive element ; and we did not hesitate to say what we thought about this . Even after the Agadir incident was quite closed , the tension between Germany and England had not passed away . The military party in the former country began to talk of a preventive ' war pretty loudly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote of German opinion that ' we all know that blood is assuredly about to be shed , and the longer we wait the more there will be . Few , however , have the courage to imitate Frederick the Great , and not one dares the deed . ' The Emperor therefore sent his message in the beginning of 1912 , to theeffect that feeling had become so much excited that it was not enough to rely on the ordinary diplomatic intercourse for softening it , and that he was anxious for an exchange of views between the Cabinets of Berlin and London , of a personal and direct kind . As the result of this intimation , the British Cabinet decided to send one of its members to Berlin to hold conversations , ' with a view to exploring and , if practicable , softening the causes of tension , and I was requested by the Prime Minister and Sir Edward Grey and my other colleagues , to go to Berlin and undertake the task . Our Ambassador there came over to London specially to discuss arrangements , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started . I arrived in the German capital on February 8 , 1912 , and spent some days in interviews with the Emperor , the Imperial Chancellor , the Naval Minister ( Admiral von Tirpitz ) , and others of the Emperor 's ministry . The narrative of my conversations I have extracted from the records I made after each interview , for the preservation , so far as possible , of the words used at it . My first interview was one with Herr von Bethmann-Hollweg , the Imperial Chancellor . We met in the British Embassy , and the conversation , which was quite informal , was a full and agreeable one . My impression ? and I still retain it ? was that BethmannHollweg was then as sincerely desirous of avoiding war as I was myself . I told him of certain dangers quite frankly , and he listened and replied with what seemed to me to be a full understanding of our position . I said that the increasing action of Prussia in piling up magnificent armaments was of course within the unfettered rights of the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drawing together of other nations in the interests of their own security . This was what was happening . I told him frankly that we had made naval and military preparations , but only such as defense required , and as would be considered in Germany matter of routine . I went on to observe that our faces were set against aggression by any nation , and I told him , what seemed to relieve his mind , that we had no secret military treaties . But , I added , if France were attacked and an attempt made to occupy her territory , our neutrality must not be reckoned on by Germany . For one thing , it was obvious that our position as an island protected by the sea would be affected seriously if Germany has possession of the Channel ports on the northern shores of France . Again , we were under treaty obligation to come to the aid of Belgium in case of invasion , just as we were bound to defend Portugal and Japan in certain eventualities . In the third place , owing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials , we could not sit still if Germany elected to develop her fleet to such an extent as to imperil our naval protection . She might build more ships , but we should in that case lay down two keels for each one she laid down . The Chancellor said that he did not take my observations at all in bad part , but I must understand that his admirals and generals were pretty difficult . I replied that the difficulty would be felt at least as much with the admirals and generals in my own country . The Chancellor , in the course of our talk , proposed a formula of neutrality to which I will refer later on . I left the Chancellor with the sense that I had been talking with an honest man struggling somewhat with adversity . However , next day I was summoned to luncheon with the Emperorand Empress at the Schloss , and afterward had a long interview , which lasted nearly three hours , with the Emperor and Admiral von Tirpitz in the Emperor 's cabinet room . The conversation was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reception by the Emperor was very agreeable ; that by Tirpitz seemed to me a little strained . The question was , whether Germany must not continue her programme for expanding her fleet . What that programme really amounted to , we had not known in London , except that it included an increase in battleships ; but the Emperor handed me at this meeting a confidential copy of the draft of the proposed new Fleet Law , with an intimation that he had no objection to my communicating it privately to my colleagues . I was careful to abstain even from looking at it then , for I saw that , from its complexity and bulk , it would require careful study . So I simply put it in my pocket . But I repeated what I had said to the Chancellor , that the necessity for secure sea-communications rendered it necessary for us to be able to protect ourselves on the seas . Germany was quite free to do as she pleased , but so were we , and we should probably lay down two keels for every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slackening competition was really not with us but with Germany . Any agreement for settling our differences and introducing a new spirit into the relations of the two nations would be bones without flesh if Germany began by fresh shipbuilding , and so forced us to do twice as much . Indeed , the world would laugh at such an agreement , and our people would think that we had been fooled . I did not myself take that view , because I thought that the mere fact of an agreement was valuable . But the Emperor would see that the public would attach little importance to his action unless the agree- deleted material same mind . But he said that the forces he had to contend with were almost insuperable . The question of a retardation of building under the proposed Fleet Law was not susceptible of being treated apart from that of the formula of which he and the Emperor had both spoken . He suggested that we might agree on the following formula : ( 1 ) The High Contracting Powers assure each other mutually of their desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , either of them , make any combination , or join in any combination , which is directed against the other . They expressly declare that they are not bound by any such combination . ( 3 ) If either of the High Contracting Parties becomes entangled in a war with one or more other powers , the other of the High Contracting Parties will at least observe toward the power so entangled a benevolent neutrality , and use its utmost endeavor for the localization of the conflict . ( 4 ) The duty of neutrality which arises from the preceding article has no application , in so far as it may not be reconcilable with existing agreements which the High Contracting Parties have already made . The making of new agreements which make it impossible for either of the Contracting Parties to observe neutrality toward the other beyond what is provided by the preceding limitations is excluded in conformity with the provisions contained in Article 2 . Anxious as I was to agree with the Chancellor , who seemed as keen as I was to meet me with words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was unable to hold out to him the least prospect that we could accept the draft formula which he had just proposed . Under Article 2 , for example , we should find ourselves , were it accepted , precluded from com ing to the assistance of France should Germany attack her and aim at getting posseSsion of such ports as Dunkirk , Calais , and Boulogne , a friendly occupation of which was so important for our island security . Difficulties might also arise which would hamper us in discharging our existing treaty obligations to Belgium , Portugal , and Japan . The most hopeful way out was to revise the draft fundamentally by confining its terms to an undertaking by each power not to make any unprovoked attack upon the other , or join in any combination or design against the other for purposes of aggression , or become party to any plan or naval or military combination , alone or in conjunction with any other power , directed to such an end . He and I then sat down and redrafted what he had prepared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the view that it would be sufficient . We also had a satisfactory conversation about the Bagdad Railway and other things in Turkey connected with the Persian Gulf , and we discussed possibilities of the rearrangement of certain interests of both powers in Africa . He said to me that he was not there to make any immediate bargain , but that we should look at the African question on both sides from a high point of view , and that if we had any difficulties we should tell him , and he would see whether he could get round them for us . I replied that I also was not there to make a bargain , but only to explore the ground , and that I much appreciated the tone of his conversation with me , and the good feeling he had shown . I should go hack to London and without delay report to my colleagues all that had passed . VII I entertain no doubt that the German Chancellor was sincerely in earnest in what he said to me on these occasions , and in his desire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think was the Emperor ; but he was pulled at by his naval and military advisers , and by the powerful , if then small , chauvinist party in Germany . In 1912 , when the conversation recorded took place , this party was less potent , I think a good deal less , than it appears to have become a year and a half later when Germany had increased her army still further . But I formed the opinion even then that the power of the Emperor in Germany was a good deal misinterpreted and overestimated . My impression was that the really decisive influence was that of the minister who had managed to secure the strongest following throughout Germany ; and it was obvious to me that Admiral von Tirpitz had a powerful and growing following , due to the backing of the naval party , from many directions . Moreover , sensible as a large number of Germans were , there was a certain tendency to swelled-headedness in the nation . It had had an extraordinarily rapid development , based on principles of organization in every sphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity of thinking before acting enjoined by the great teachers of the beginning of the nineteenth century . The period down to about 1832 seems to me to correspond , in the intellectual prodigies it produced , to our Elizabethan period . It came no doubt to an end in its old and distinctive aspect . But its spirit assumed , later on , a new form : that of organization for material-ends based on careful reflection and calculation . In industry and commerce , in the army , and in the navy , the work of mind was everywhere apparent . Aus einem Lernvolk wollen wir eM Thatvolk werden , ' was the new watchword . No doubt there was much that was defective . When it came to actual war in 1914 , it turned out that Germany had not adequately thought out her military problems . If she had done so , she would have used her fleet at the very outset , and particularly her destroyers and submarines , to try to binder the transport of the British Expeditionary Force to France , and , having secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seize the northern ports of France . Small as the Expeditionary Force was , it was enough , when added to the French , to make them so formidable as to render the success of von KItick uncertain if the troops could be concentrated to resist him swiftly enough . Again , Germany never really grasped the implications of our command of the sea . Had she done so , I do not think she would have adventured war . She may have counted on England not coming in , owing to entanglements in Irish difficulties . If so , this was just another instance of her bad judgment about the internal affairs of other nations . In fine , Germany had not adequately thought out or prepared for the perils which she undertook when she assumed the risks of the War of 1914 . No doubt she knew more about the shortcomings of the Russian army than did the French or the British . On these , pretty exact knowledge of the Russian shortages enabled her to reckon . There we miscalculated more than she did . But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief but conclusive campaign in the West , which was all she could afford while Russia was organizing . Then , later on , she ought to have seen that , if the submarine campaign which she undertook should bring the United States into the war , her ultimate fate would be sealed by blockade . In the end she no doubt fought magnificently . But she made these mistakes , which were mainly due to that swelled-headedness which deflected her reasoning and prevented her from calculating consequences aright . There was a good deal of this apparent , even in 1912 . It had led to the Agadir business in the previous summer , and the absence of wise prevision was still apparent . I believed that this phase of militarism would pass when Imperial Germany became a more mature nation . Indeed , it was passing under the . growing influence of Social Democracy , which was greatly increased by the elections which took place while I was in Berlin in 1912 . But still there was the possibility of an explosion ; and when I returned to London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries were going to be improved , and told my colleagues so , I also reported that there were three matters about which I was uneasy . The first was my strong impression that the new Fleet Law would be insisted on . The second was the possibility that von Tirpitz might be made Chancellor of the Empire in place of von BethmannHollweg . This was being talked of as possible when I was in Berlin . The third was the want of continuity in the supreme direction of German policy . Foreign policy especially was under divided control . Von Tchirsky observed to me in 1906 that what he had been saying about a question , that we were discussing represented his view as Foreign Minister of Prussia , but that next door was the Chancellor , who might express quite a different view to me if I asked him ; and that if , later on , I should go to the end of Wilhelm Strasse and turn down Unter den Linden I would come to the Schloss , where I might derive from the Emperor 's lips an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Chancellor . This made me feel that , desirous as Bethmann-Hollweg had shown himself to establish and preserve good relations , we could not count on his influence being maintained or prevailing . As an eminent foreign diplomatist observed , ' In this highly organized nation , when you have ascended to the very top story you find not only confusion but chaos . ' However , after I had reported fully on all the details to the Cabinet , which I did on the day of my return to London , and after the Foreign Office had received my written report , matters were taken in hand by Sir Edward Grey , and by him I was kept informed . Presently it became apparent that there were those in Berlin who were interfering with the Chancellor in his efforts for good relations . A dispatch came which was inconsistent with the line he had pursued with me , and it became evident that the German Government was likely to insist on proceeding with the new Fleet Law . When we looked closely into the copy of the draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very large increases contemplated , of which we had no notion earlier , not only in the battleships , about which we did know before , but in small craft and submarines and personnel . As these increases were to proceed further , discussion about the terms of a formula became rather futile , and we had only one course left open to us ? to respond by quietly increasing our navy and concentrating its strength in northern seas . This was done with great energy by Mr. Churchill , the result being that , as the outcome of the successive administrations of the fleet by Mr. McKenna and himself , the estimates were raised by over twenty millions sterling to fifty-one millions . VI " In the summer of 1912 I became Lord Chancellor , and the engrossing duties , judicial as well as administrative , of that office cut me off from any direct participation in the carrying on of our efforts for better relations with Germany . But these relations continued to be extended in the various ways practicable and left open to Sir Edward Grey and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was in Berlin , about Africa and the Bagdad Railway , were continued between them through the ambassadors ; and just before the war the draft of an extensive treaty had been agreed on . Then , after an interval of two years , came a time of extreme anxiety . No one had better opportunities than I of watching Sir Edward 's concentration of effort to avoid the calamity which threatened . For he was living with me in my house in Queen Anne 's Gate through the whole of these weeks , and he was devoting himself , with passionate earnestness of purpose , to inducing the German Government to use its influence with Austria for a peaceful settlement . But it presently became evident that the Emperor and his ministers had made up their minds that they were going to grasp the opportunity that appeared to have come . As I have already said , I think their calculations were framed on a wholly erroneous basis . It is clear that their military advisers had failed to take account , in their estimates of probabilities , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against them . The ultimate result we all know . May the lesson taught the world by the determined entry of the United States into the conflict between right and wrong never be forgotten by the world ! Why Germany acted as she did then is a matter that still requires careful investigation . My own feeling is that she has demonstrated the extreme risk of confiding great political decisions to military advisers . It is not their business to have the last word in deciding between peace and war . The problem is too far-reaching for their training . Bismarck knew this well , and often said it , as students of his life and reflections are aware . Had he been at the helm I do not believe that he would have allowed his country to drift into a disastrous course . He was far from perfect in his ethical standards , but he had something of that quality which Mommsen , in his history , attributes to Julius Cmsar . Him the historian describes as one of those mighty ones who have preserved to the end of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the impossible , and have not broken down in the task which for greatly gifted natures is the most difficult ' of all ? the task of recognising , when on the pinnacle of success , its natural limits . What was possible lie performed , and never left the possible good undone for the sake of the impossible better ; never disdained at least to mitigate by palliatives evils that were incurable . But where he recognized that fate had spoken , he always obeyed . Alexander on the Hyphasis , Napoleon at Moscow , turned back because they were compelled to do so , and were indignant at destiny for bestowing even on its favorites merely limited successes . Cresar turned back voluntarily on the Thames and on the Rhine , and thought of carrying into effect , even at the Danube and the Euphrates , not unbounded plans of world-conquest , but merely well-considered frontier regulations . If only Germany , whose great historian thus explained these things , had remembered them , how different might have been her position to-day . But it may be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free . With her certainly rests the whole responsibility for what has happened ; for apart from her Austria would not have acted as she did , nor would Turkey , nor Bulgaria . The fascinating glitter of her armies , and the assurances given by her General Staff , were too much for the minor nations whom she had induced to accept her guidance , and too much I think also for her own people . No doubt the ignorance of these about the ways of their own government counted for a great deal . There has never been such a justification of the principle of democratic control as this war affords . But a nation must be held responsible for the action of its own rulers , however much it has simply submitted itself to them . I have the impression that even to-day in its misery the German public does not fully understand , and still believes that Germany was the victim of a plot to entrap and encircle her , and that with this in view Russia mobilized on a great scale for war . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared to Germany and to Austria , and there is little doubt that to the latter Serbia was an unquiet neighbor . But these considerations must be taken in their context ? a context of which the German public ought to have made itself fully aware . The leaders of its opinion were bent on domination of the Near East . No wonder that the Slays in the Balkan Peninsula became progressively alarmed , and looked to Russia more and more for protection . For it had become plain that moral considerations would not be allowed by the authorities at Berlin to weigh in the balance against material advantages to be gained by power , of domination . If there is room for reproach to us Anglo-Saxons , it is reproach of a very different kind . Germany was quite intelligent enough to listen to reason , and , besides , she had the prospect of becoming the dominating industrial and commercial power in the world by dint merely of peaceful penetration . It is possible that , if her relations with her Western neighbors , including Great Britain , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been saved from a great blunder , and might have come to understand that the English-speaking races were not really so inferior to herself as she took them to be . Her hubris was in part , at all events , the result of ignorance . Speaking for my own countrymen , I think that neither did we know enough about the Germans , nor did the Germans know enough about us . They were ignorant of the innate capacity for fighting , in industrial and military conflicts alike , which our history shows that we have always hitherto brought to light in great emergencies . . And they realized little how tremendously great moral issues could stir and unite democracies . We , on the other hand , knew almost nothing of their tradition , their literature , or their philosophy . Our statesmen did not read their newspapers , and rarely visited their country . We were deficient in that quality which President Murray Butler has spoken of as the ' international mind . ' I do not know whether , had it been otherwise , we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which I tried to express the hope , although not without misgiving , in the address on ' Higher Nationality ' which I was privileged to deliver before distinguished representatives of the United States and Canada at Montreal September 1 , 1913 . I spoke then of the possibility of a larger entente , an entente which might become a real concert of the Great Powers of the world ; and I quoted the great prayer with which Grotius concludes his book on War and Peace . There was at least the chance , if we strove hard enough , that we might find a response from the best in other countries , and in the end attain to a new and a real Sittlichkeit which should provide a firmer basis for International Law and reverence for international obligations . But for the realization of this dream a sustained and strenuous search after fuller mutual knowledge was required . After this address had been published , I received a letter from the German Chancellor , von Bethmann-Hollweg , in which ( writing in German and as late as September 26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If I had the happiness of finding myself of one mind with you in these thoughts in February , 1912 , it has been to me a still greater satisfaction that our two countries have since then had a number of opportunities of working together in this spirit . Like you , I hold the optimistic view that the great nations will be able to progress further un this path , and will do so . Anyhow , I shall , in so far as it is within my power , devote my energies to this cause , and Ism happy in the certainty of finding in you an openly declared fellow worker . But events swept him from a course which , so far as I know , he at least individually desired to follow . The great increase of armaments took place that year in Germany , and , when events were too strong for him , he elected , not to resign , but to throw in his lot with his country . His position was one of great difficulty . He took a course for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong course . What he said when Belgium was invaded in breach of solemn treaty shows that he felt this .. He let himself be swept into devoting his energies to bolstering up his country 's cause , instead of resigning . His career only proves that , given the political conditions that obtained in Germany shortly before the war , it was almost impossible for a German statesman to keep his feet , or to avoid being untrue to himself . And yet there were many others there in the same frame of mind , and one asks one 's self whether , had they had more material to work with , they might not have been able to present a more attractive alternative than the notion of militerry domination which in the end took possession of all , from the Emperor downwards . It is , however , useless to speculate at present on these things . We know too little of the facts . The historians of another generation will know more . But of one thing I feel sure . The Germans think that Great Britain declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a sense in which she did . The opinion of Mr. Asquith , Sir Edward Grey , and of those of us who were by their side , was unhesitating . She could not have taken any other course than she did without the prospect of ruin and failure to enter on the only path of honor . For honor and policy alike necessitated that she should take , without the delay which would have been fatal , the step she did take without delay and unswervingly . The responsibility for her entry comes back wholly to Germany herself , who would not have brought it about had she not plunged into war . And to-day Germany lies prostrate . But she is not dead . I do not think that for generations to come she will dream of building again on military foundations . Her people have had a lesson in the overwhelming forces which are inevitably called into action where there is brutal indifference to the moral rights of others . What remains to her is that which she has inherited and preserved of the results of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lessing and Kant , and culminated in the teaching of Goethe and Schiller and of the thinkers who were their contemporaries . That movement only came to a partial end in 1832 . No doubt its character changed after that . The idealists in poetry , music , and philosophy gave place to great men of science , to figures such as those of Ludwig and Liebig , of Gauss , Riemann , and Helmholz . There came also historians like Ranke and Mommsen , musicians like Wagner , philosophers like Schopenhauer and Lotze , statesmen like Bismarck . Today there are few men of great stature in Germany ; there are indeed few men of genius anywhere in the world . But Germany still has a high average level in science , and of recent years she has produced great captains of industry . The gift for organization founded on principle and for applying science to practical uses was there before the war , and it is very unsafe to assume that it is not there in a latent form to-day . If it is , Germany will be heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not include devotion to military affairs in the old way . Against her competition of this other kind , formidable as soon as she has recovered from her misery , we must prepare ourselves in the only way that can succeed in the long run . We too must study and organize on the basis of widely diffused exact knowledge and high ethical standards . I think , if I read the signs of the times aright , that people are coming to realize this , both in the United States and throughout the British Empire .
