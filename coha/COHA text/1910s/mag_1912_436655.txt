The city of Lawrence , Massachusetts , with a population of 86,000. has been built up in seventy years . During the last twenty years the increase in population has been about forty per cent . ? twice as large as the growth of the entire country . The reason for this growth has been the factories , now locking up an investment of about $80,000,000 , with an annual pay roll of $13,000,000 to 30,000 wage-earners . In the cotton and woolen mills 25,000 of these wage-earners are employed , and it is safe to say that for every operative there has been over $2,500 of capital invested . The city is now second in the country in output of woolens and worsteds . The strike began on January 12 . Its cause ( explained later ) was a reduction in pay of about threeand-one-half per cent by legislative reduction of factory working hours . Organized within two days , the strikers demanded an advance of fifteen per cent , abolition of bonuses , and double pay for overtime . The strike lasted nine weeks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result was a great victory for the strikers . Within a fortnight the settlement had compelled corresponding advances in nearly all textile mills in New England , affecting 275,000 textile operatives . THE writer who reveals the truth about Lawrence will be respected and disliked by all factions . His impartiality and courage will entitle him to respect , but his praise and blame for each one of the parties in interest will certainly not make him popular . The situation at Lawrence has been very complex , and to judge it correctly one must study it without passion , without prejudice , and , hardest of all , without pity . From first to last there has been much misrepresentation in the daily papers . The public has had to form its opinions from the press reports , and the tendency to ' play up ' news for its dramatic rather than its actual value , has made these reports less significant than they have seemed to be . There has been over-emphasis and lack of proportion . Much that has been written was irrelevant to the questions at issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a just estimate . When people are said to be starving it is hard to be judicial about them . To be sure , nobody was starving in Lawrence at any time , but it was part of the emotion of the moment to suppose that they were . And so , when logic would not travel fast enough , pity has pushed it from behind . The many forms of suffering and distress have been accredited to the obvious instead of being traced to their true source . The public mind has become bewildered . At present there probably can not be a judicial presentation of the case ; time is needed to put events in true relation to causes . But it is possible to correct some falsities and relieve some perplexities regarding essential facts . It is not the purpose of this article to outline the events of the strike , or restate what is generally known . It is written rather to try to clear up a confusion resulting from too much statement and too little reflection . It is not heat but light that is needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City of Lawrence ( through its officials : Mayor Scanlon , Commissioner Lynch , Marshal Sullivan , and Judge Mahoney ) ; the Citizens ' Committee of Lawrence ; the mills ; the strikers ; the militia of the state ; the American Federation . of Labor ( represented by John Golden as head of the United Textile Workers of America ) ; and the Industrial Workers of the World ( represented by Ettor , Haywood , Thompson , Yates , and Trautmann ) . All relief workers , the Legislative Committee , and the Lawrence police , are comprehended in the above groups . The trouble started over a question of wages : the withdrawal from the weekly envelope of two hours ' pay , because of legislative reduction of the factory working hours of women and children ( not men workers ) from fifty-six to fifty-four hours a week , and the consequent inability to operate the mills for these two hours . Neither party had made any effort to secure this legislation , and to the employer it was so distasteful that he was drawn into committing an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no notice to his employees ( many of whom were ignorant of both the language and legislation of the state ) that the weekly pay would be changed to fit the legislation . No excuse can be given for this omission . It was open to reasonable doubt whether such legislative action , in the absence of any notice from the mill-owners , would necessarily work a revision of wages . It would have cost nothing more than a little courtesy to have made a brief explanation , especially in view of the dull mentality of many of the workers . Instead , the mill-owners permitted their employees to labor one entire week under a misapprehension of the facts , and in ignorance of the reduced wages each worker was to receive . They then presented the reduced pay . An inflammable temperament on one side , and irritated aloofness on the other , aggravated the first clash , and within a few hours the strike was spreading rapidly . There was some intimidation , and a little destruction inside the mills , which drove out many who had no intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor organization in Lawrence , and no recognized leader or committee with whom the owners could confer . There were a few feeble craft unions affiliated with the A. F. of L. and a small number of unskilled laborers ( probably about three hundred ) who had recently joined the I. W. W. It is possible that if there had been a responsible organization , the strike would not have occurred . In any case it would have been a different affair , with a consideration of differences before a strike was declared , a conference , and a more orderly course of events . That no reliable labor organization existed in Lawrence is due solely to the mill-owners . They had systematically discouraged every effort to organize the various crafts . Such organization was attempted by the United Textile Workers of America , but it could not gain ground against the quiet antagonism of the mills . Eight months before the strike , the very large body of unskilled non-organized textile laborers in Lawrence had attracted the attention of the I. W. W. The A. F. of L. had selfishly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the I. W. W. its chance to secure recruits . Swiftly on the heels of the first trouble came Joseph J. Ettor to organize the workers of eighteen nationalities into a compact industrial ' body under the banner of the I. W. W. Ettor is one of the five members of the General Executive Board of the I. W. W. ( the highest authority in the order ) , a man crafty in method , quick in action , and with much personal magnetism . No time was wasted by Ettor in mere organization . His plan of campaign was , first to weld the factions tightly together , then win the victory , and then organize permanently . To unite those conflicting racial antagonisms into a single bond of brotherhood was no small job for any man to do , yet Ettor did it ! Make a note of the man who could come as a stranger into that polyglot chaos , and transform it . He knew that misery makes strange bed-fellows , and that hearts are welded by suffering endured together . They would not call one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he knew the value of permitting a certain amount of violence at first in order that its repression might fan the flames of resentment and help the ' uniting . ' Tactically he outpointed the mill agents . The working plan for temporary organization was very simple . Each nationality or group sent one , two , or three members to form a Strike Committee . This committee ( about fifty persons ) met every morning , heard reports , investigated complaints , and gave suggestions . All the strikers were admitted to stand at the back of the hall during these daily meetings , but were excluded from executive sessions . The I. W. W. leaders merely presided and spoke at these and other mass meetings , directed the organization work , and generally counseled what to do and how to do it . The Strike Committee received this advice , and if they approved it either acted on it or passed it on for the strikers ' acceptance . The strikers held both group and general meetings , and a ' yes ' or no ' vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the acute situation during the first six weeks by the mills , the militia , the mayor , the police and the courts , has been severely blamed and warmly praised . Only an expert in such conflicts is competent to pass judgment here . I am not such an ex pert . The truth is probably between the two extremes . There is no doubt that the administration of law and order was somewhat arbitrary , yet the situation was critical and a strong arm was needed ; the validity of the legal process under which Ettor was arrested was questionable , yet both Et-tor and Haywood should have been prevented from inciting to revolution ; the authorities who stopped the sending away of the children were again straining the validity of legal process to accomplish their ends , yet the children were obviously being sent away for exploitation , to arouse sympathy , and to incite contributions of money to prolong the strike . The turning back of the children at the depot offered a fine chance to yellow journalism . As a matter of fact , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , and no trampling upon children , except in the newspapers . It is always a revolting sight to see force used upon a woman , but if the woman resists violently , the force must be violent too . The scene at the depot was repulsive and nauseating , but no more revolting to witness than any surgical operation . There was considerable disorder and rioting during the first fortnight , when Ettor was in control ; there was a great amount of unseen intimidation during the rest of the time , when Haywood was the dominant force . It was a very hard problem for the authorities . The militia , under the wise handling of Colonel Sweetser , performed a trying task with restraint ; they deserve great credit . Judge Mahoney 's bold and firm administration of the police court was the severest check to the weapon of intimidation . Some social workers who inyestigated Lawrence censured one of the mill agents because upon the approach of a riotous crowd armed with clubs and stones , a poweiful stream of water was thrown from the fire-hose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , and many of the strikers possessed no other clothing than the garments they wore . The measure was drastic . Whether such a measure will stop violence or rather start violence ; whether it was merited , and if merited whether wise , are questions which can properly be answered only by those eye-witnesses who have expert knowledge of the temper and control of mobs . That the mob was riotous is clearly shown , and it is not correct to say that the throwing of the water precipitated the window-smashing . It did , however , intensify the bitterness , and is even now remembered with deep resentment . But the real grievance at Lawrence from first to last was the small sum which went into the pay envelopes , and sooner or later we must come to the question whether the Lawrence mills paid sufficient wages to their operatives , especially to the unskilled class . The answer to that question depends upon the point of view . There are two points of view . The man who stands for the established order has strong arguments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between capital and labor , in which capital has inaugurated , conducted , and created the enterprises of the earth , and labor has worked for capital , receiving its accepted wage . And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day , he sent them into his vineyard . ' By the standards of industrial civilization labor has been a commodity which could be bought and sold , and as such it is controlled by immutable economic laws . The market price of labor is governed , when not under the stress of industrial warfare , as all other market prices are governed , by the supply and demand . Everywhere and always this has been the rule in business dealings . The Lawrence mills are a business enterprise ; they are run on a business basis ; they must be so run ! To run them on any basis of mixed business and philanthropy would be to end the textile industry in Lawrence . Where would the textile workers go then ? To the Southern mills where still lower wages are given ? Or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where they now work fifty-seven hours for less wages than the Lawrence mills pay for fifty-four hours ? This is not meant as an argument in defense of those wretched wages in Lawrence . It is merely a statement that the low-paid , unskilled worker at Lawrence has been paid the wages that the laws of supply and demand have fixed for such labor . Under the plan we are now considering , capital takes all the risk . Sometimes capital succeeds and gains greatly ; sometimes it fails and loses all . Labor neither gains nor fails ; it takes no risk . Let us be fair about this matter . We have blamed the Lawrence mill-owner for the low wage . He is not to blame for it ! The whole textile industry is not to blame for it ! Who , then , is ? The community ? you and I and every one of us . We create the supply and demand . Of course these people are not paid enough to live as American citizens or according to American ideas . But who knows whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to American ideals if they had more pay ? It is rather a matter of race and custom . Many of them represent a low scale of Asiatic living , lower even than the pauper labor of Europe ; and a far more serious question than their present wage is , ' How do you propose to weave them into a Massachusetts community ? ' They understand no law , language , or custom except of their own race , and care for no other . Who brought them over here ? And who let them in ? The United States authorities , after rigid investigation , find no evidence that the Lawrence mill-owners brought them . The truth is that the steamship companies , for their own profit , collected them from every direction and any source . Many of them arrive saturated with ideas of revolutionary socialism and class hatred . Our immigration laws let them freely in , regardless of the fact that they collect in such compact masses as to make it impossible to assimilate them or teach them American principles . We have reached a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( with their impossible standards ) in our industrial centres is preparing a very dark problem for the future . We come back to consider the more recent and humanitarian attitude toward labor , as opposed to the old view of labor as a commodity . The humanitarian view is that labor is a partner with capital , and should share in the profits . A certain interest should be allowed for the use of the money , a certain extra profit for the risk of the business to which it is subjected , a certain sum set aside for renewal of the plant , and the remainder of the profits should be divided between capital which supplies the tool , and labor which works the tool . Just what proportion should go to labor varies according to the sympathy of the speaker , from an ' equal share ' to a ' generous share . ' It is fair to assume that as a necessary part of the plan the profits of every enterprise would have to be put in the pillory of publicity ' and known by every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of business and encourage capital to take the risks of new undertakings , is open to serious doubt . It is certainly a splendid vision of righteous ? if as yet unpractical ? dealing ; and on the moral point of view we must all agree . In fact , the only exception one need take to the plan is to insist that , as a partnership , it must in justice be accepted by both partners . To force one partner to join the partnership with a pistol pointed at his head , is only anotherform of despotism . But the advocates of partnership point to the mills , which are already built and can not run away , and they suggest that the capitalist owners can be compelled to accept the new partnership . In this they lose sight of one fact : that every large business must be renewed with fresh capital or it soon dies of exhaustion . But it may be claimed that this fresh capital is easily obtainable from the existing profits ; and this brings us to the complaint that the Lawrence mills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneficent years of the Dingley Tariff ( from 1897 till the panic year of 1907 ) , and that these high profits should have been used to pay higher wages to the workers , rather than to build new and larger mills . It is certainly true in theory that the tariff on manufactured textiles is placed there for the protection of the American workman , and the absurdity exists of protection for commerce and free trade for labor . But again it is true that the wages paid to American textile workers under this tariff have steadily averaged from forty-nine to one hundred and eighty per cent higher than those paid to the non-tariff-protected English worker in the same line of work , while the production per worker has been as large in Great Britain as in this country . Yet this takes no account of the greatly increased cost of living in the United States , and to be of any real value , such a comparison should be made on the purchasing power of the pay envelope , rather than its monetary value . It is in evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawrence declared it harder to live under the wages of Lawrence / than under the wages of Lancashire . These are the confusing facts which await adjustment . But in all this controversy it is interesting to note that no one has explained why the Lawrence mills should lead the way in this reform . Why should Lawrence be more high-minded than the business world ? Why should the Lawrence mills do what no other employers anywhere are doing , and become semi-benevolent institutions ? So long as economic laws govern all our industries to the extent they do to-day , it is asking much of Lawrence to demand that she should go beyond all precedents and inaugurate a new order . When all is said , economic laws work out a far greater measure of justice than is seen upon the surface . Strike or no strike , it is open to doubt whether any body of workers can long obtain a higher wage than the economic conditions allow . The effort to make men exchange , not in accordance with supply and demand , but on arbitrary lines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lawrence " necessitates a word about the bonus system . It is a method of cumulative reward to each operative for increased output within one month , provided only one day has been lost from work . Seemingly fair , it really causes hardship . Women work when wholly unable to work because they can not afford , by losing a second day to lose a month 's bonus . Further , the system encourages favoritism . Thus , the loom-fixer 's bonus is dependent on his weaver 's bonuses , and he naturally favors those weavers who are ahead of their schedule . A weaver who is behind is kept waiting while a loom is arranged for some weaver who is sure of her bonus . This dependence of one worker 's bonus upon another 's extends through many processes . ? THE AUTHOR . The enthusiast will say that all this is of little account , for wages in the Lawrence mills have now been advanced , and the victory has proved the truth of the long contention . That is not yet determined . By the weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mill-owners , before adopting this arbitrary advance , wished to be sure that the economic conditions of the future would sustain those new wages . Regardless of their own judgment , they have been forced to pay them . Whether the future will justify and support this extra expense , no one knows . Future demand is uncertain ; Schedule K seems assured of sharp downward revision . The prices of the mill products will now be advanced , and the demand for them is not a fixed quantity , but is directly affected by their cost . If the demand is cut down , either the number of workers or the hours of work must be decreased . That public sentiment is prepared to reduce still further the hours of labor is doubtful . During the nine weeks of the strike , wages in the Lawrence mills have been constantly discussed in connection with the number of persons in the family group . Just what bearing the number of children had on the father 's efficiency as a worker was never stated . It should not be necessary to point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the father ; the fact that he wanted a large family is no reason why the mills should pay him higher wages ; and the real sin , if any exists , lies at his door for bringing children into the world when he was unable to support them . But the newspapers , the strikers , and many relief workers , asked , ' Here is a man with wife and six children , receiving only twelve dollars a week ; do you call that a living wage ? ' This was another way of insisting that the number of dependents should decide the wage-scale . The only possible relation between wages and the size of the family is that the size of the wages should regulate the size of the family . A living wage ' would seem to refer to a wage on which the worker may support himself . The expression can scarcely be held to include any number of extra persons , from one to twenty , whom the worker may elect to support . I mention these two instances , not because they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exaggeration , and the dangerous use of sentiment in place of reasoning , which marked so many of the newspaper accounts and helped to poison the public mind against the mill-owners . It is unjust to condemn the I. W. W. for inciting to violence , and not extend some condemnation to a portion of the press . It required no courage to play to the galleries ; pity is always appealing . It was a fine pose to stand as the champion of the weak ; something was always ' doing ' on the strikers ' side , and it offered a lot of local color . There was no special interest in the mill-owners ; they were only business men and uninteresting exhibits , but they were in the public eye and must be made interesting somehow . So the president of one of the large corporations was pictured as a robber baron , who did n't know how many automobiles he owned , but who charged the poor people for drinking water . Thousands of persons to-day believe that Mr. Wood is just that kind of a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen him , I own no stock in his mills , and I hold no brief to defend him . But for the sake of getting within speaking distance of the truth , let the facts be known . I state them without the gentleman 's knowledge or consent but I believe them to be accurate . Summoned before a tribunal , he was asked how many automobiles he had on a date some weeks earlier . At about the date thus specifically fixed he owned three cars ; one had been burned up in a garage fire ; an order had been given to replace it , and at a later date it was replaced ; the second had been loaned to a relative or friend , and was away at about that date ; the third was the car used for himself and his family . Whether on that exact day to which the inquiry referred the burned car had been replaced or not , ? whether the loaned car had been returned or not , ? he honestly did not know , and he made the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know . ' Now for the drinking water . When the water-supply of the City of Lawrence was taken directly from the Merrimac River , it was under serious suspicion , and the people of the city very generally drank bottled spring-water . Then the city put in a large filtration plant , and the purified water , approved by the Board of Health , was freely drunk in every house and is to-day the regular drinking water of the city . It is claimed that in the mills the water-pipes run so close to the steam-pipes that the water becomes heated . These new mills of the American Woolen Company represent the furthest advance in mill-construction , the highest achievement in mill-engineering , and I do not believe that their heavily-jacketed steam-pipes can overheat the water-pipes near them . In the best office-buildings in Boston the faucet water in winter will run slightly warm for the first minute or so . This may happen in the Lawrence mills , but it is merely till fresh water can enter the pipes . However , for this or some other reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clubbed together and ordered it delivered at the mill ; it was n't cold enough to please them , so they ordered ice . They had a perfect right to do all this , and had Mr. Wood attempted to restrain them he would have been justly called harsh names . But the owners had nothing to do with this spring-water : they neither ordered it , paid for it , nor knew anything about it other than as any outsider might know of it . Yet one Boston paper published a cartoon of a poor , ragged , half-starved little girl in one of the rooms of the mill dropping five cents into a slot in order to get a drink of water . Much has been written about the wretched housing of the Lawrence operatives , and it is undeniably bad . But it is no worse than can be seen in Boston or New York . I asked one question wherever I went : ' Are the wages , housing , and general welfare of the operatives any worse in Lawrence than in any other textile city in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say No , ' but I thought the labor leaders would say ' Yes . ' I asked Mayor Scanlon and he said ' No ' ; I asked a previous mayor of the city , I asked the Citizens ' Committee , and I asked Judge Mahoney ; they all said ' No . ' Then I went to John Golden . No worse , ' was his reply . I went to Ettor . ' Bad , but not any worse in Lawrence than elsewhere , ' said Ettor . I went to Haywood . No worse here than in every Massachusetts textile city , ' said he . Finally I went to the mill-owners and they said , ' A little worse , because the overcrowding in one small section of the city is probably not equaled in any other textile centre . ' It is interesting to note this evidence in view of the general impression that Lawrence was infamously notorious , ' as one paper phrased it . It was impossible to see the housing conditions fairly , however , unless one combatted the efforts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the most distress ing cases , and give only extreme statistics . In no case were these typical or average conditions , and when I insisted on seeing a dozen relief cases . taken at random , the answer was , ' But such cases would not be interesting ! We can find you something a good deal worse if you 'll give us a little time . ' The fact is that the living conditions of some of the immigrants from southeastern Europe are their own choice , and they are vile . The men come without their families , for a quick clean-up of all the money they can collect , and a speedy return to their native soil . In some of the New England textile cities they sleep on the floor , from fourteen to seventeen in a room . They waste no money on even the cheapest restaurants , but eat in the same way in which they sleep ? on the basis of hoboes and tramps . But they are as non-typical in their way as the published case of four families in five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixteen persons ( mostly boarders ) lived in three rooms . Lawrence is not wholly to blame for her congestion . In large measure overcrowding has come from under-letting . It should be stated that in some of the most congested houses money is being saved each week . Many families who crowd together in one or two rooms receive the same wages as those who live in entirely decent surroundings . To form a proper estimate of the Lawrence strike some knowledge is necessary of the community in which the conflict occurred . The mills , which have practically built up the city , are owned mainly by a large body of nonresidents , who have little knowledge of the place or its problems . Paying no taxes , they have no interest in the municipal government . The resident mill officials are very able men , but they have their important business duties and feel no call to engage in politics . The mills , until two years ago , paid only a tax on their real estate and machinery ( no franchise tax ) , yet they dumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single dollar toward the support of the city , must at the city 's expense be educated , policed , safeguarded from fire , watched over in the matter of sanitation and health , and generally given all the privileges of city planning and administration . To cater to the wants of 30,000 factory-hands there have come into Lawrence many small store-keepers , clerks , sales-people , and mechanics in all trades , none of them owning much taxable property . Thereare no wealthy persons living in Lawrence . Naturally the taxes are high ; the one cry from the taxpayer is , ' Keep down the taxes ' ; and his last concern or desire is to do anything for the foreigners who herd like cattle , outrage health and decency , and raise the tax-rate . It is a fact that the curriculum of the Lawrence schools ( especially the evening schools ) has had to be practically made over to provide for the teaching of English on a most extensive scale as the first step in the education of these nontax-payers . Into this puzzle of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plundered the city of what little was left . Bankrupt and almost helpless , the State legislature came to the relief of Lawrence and provided it with a new charter , safeguarded against corruption . Loans were raised , and a fresh start was made under a new government of upright men . They had been in office just a fortnight , and were wholly inexperienced in their duties , when the strike came . That it should have almost paralyzed the city government was to be expected . The police force was unable to cope with a mob of from 5,000 to 9,000 highly inflammable men , and the mills would unquestionably have been damaged had not the Governor called out the troops . But Lawrence , with the help of the militia staggered through its task . The new city officials have learned a great deal . So have the citizens . So , too , have the mill agents . Best of all , public sentiment has been informed and is already working for many improvements . The strike at Lawrence has forcibly called public attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the Industrial Workers of the World . It would be misleading to speak of it as a labor organization , ' for that expression has come to have a very definite meaning in the last quarter of a century , and the aims and methods of the I. W. W. are wholly contrary to such an interpretation . The I. W. W. is an anarchistic organization , pure and simple . It makes no concealment of its nature or object . Its aim is the overthrow of the existing social order , the taking possession by labor of all the machinery of production and the driving out of the capitalist class . The organization was conceived in the brains of two men as recently as 1904 ; the project was discussed in that year in Chicago by a small body of chosen spirits . They sent word to all labor organizations inviting a conference . Those who responded came from the West , where the strength of the I. W. W. is still found . Six months later they held their first convention . The backbone of the movement was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Moyer , Haywood , and Pettibone , and made famous by the dynamite work of Harry Orchard . In 1908 the L W. W. ( then three years old ) divided into two factions , and it still remains divided . Both agree on the end to be attained , but the Detroit faction believes this end should be attained in a democracy by the ballot . while the Chicago faction ( strongly anarchistic ) believes in ' direct action. * Haywood and Ettor are of this latter group . In seven years , despite division , the I. W. W. has gained great headway , spreading like a pestilence through the north-western lumber camps and the metalliferous mining fields . Montana , Idaho , Nevada , and California are hot-beds of the movement . In the great strike at McKees Rocks , Pennsylvania , in 1909 , they served notice on the State constabulary that for every person it killed a life would be demanded by the strikers , and they kept their word . In one battle ten strikers were killed , and the I. W. W. collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory for the strikers . In New England ( outside of Lawrence ) the I. W. W. has some strength in New Bedford and in Providence . They have no power in New York State , but they are very strong at Paterson and West Hoboken , N. J. The famous preamble to the constitution of the I. W. W. has been called a vicious document . It was written by a man named Hagerty , and it can be condensed into one word , ' War . ' One day I told Haywood that I should like to talk over that preamble with him , as I had heard it called a terrible document . He merely smiled , and said that he hoped it was terrible . Told once that his organization was ' incendiary , ' Haywood replied , ' That ' s what we have been trying to tell you people . Glad you see the point ! ' Thus there is no evasion , no subterfuge , and no attempt to conceal the end to be attained or the method of attaining it . The end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood by the following extracts from a pamphlet issued by the I. W. W. : ? ' As a revolutionary organization the Industrial Workers of the World aims to use any and all tactics that will get the results sought with the least expenditure of time and energy . The tactics used are determined solely by the power of the organization to make good in their use . The question of " right " and " wrong " does not concern us . No terms made with an employer are final . All peace , so long as the wage-system lasts , is but an armed truce . At any favorable opportunity the struggle is renewed . The organization does not allow contracts with the employers . It aims , where strikes are used , to paralyze all branches of the industry involved , when the employers can least afford a cessation of work ? during the busy season and when there are rush orders to be filled . Failing to force concessions from the employers by the strike , work is resumed and " sabotage " is used to force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During strikes the works are closely picketed and every effort made to keep the employers from getting workers into the shops . All supplies are cut off from strike-bound shops . All shipments are refused or mis-sent , delayed and lost if possible . Strike-breakers are also isolated to the full extent of the powers of the organization . Interference by the government is resented by open violation of the government 's orders , going to jail en masse , causing expense to the tax-payers ? which is but another name for the employing class . In short , the I. W. W. advocates the use of militant " direct action " tactics to the full extent of our power to make them . ' This is not political socialism . It is not anything political or theoretical . The I. W. W. does not talk , write , or argue . It acts ! It cares nothing for right ' or wrong . ' It openly defies government by law , and announces that it will use any violence it can commit . The organization has no president ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these are in the West , two are on the Pacific coast , and one ( Ettor ) is in the East . When I arrived in Lawrence Ettor was under arrest , but by permission of the authorities I spent half a day with him in jail . He is very , different from Haywood , and quite unlike Trautmann , or Yates , or Thompson . He spoke unreservedly , and ( after we had cleared up his first insincerity ) with frankness . He told me things that I do not feel justified in repeating , yet he asked no pledge of secrecy . On the other hand , Haywood served notice upon me at the start that I could never have any conference with him unless he had some friend in the room , presumably as a witness . Haywood has been credited with not wishing the Lawrence strike to be settled , but with using the situation solely as propaganda for a demonstration of the I. W. W. The assumption is warranted , but nevertheless untrue . I know from inside sources that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so than his appearance and words indicated . The I. W. W. does not believe in long strikes . To use its own words : ' A strike that can not be won in four to six weeks can not be won by remaining out longer . The employer can better afford to fight one strike that lasts six months than he can six strikes that take place in that period . ' It is impossible to ? see the advent of this new force in the labor field without contrasting it with the trade-unionism of the last quarter-century as embodied in the American Federation of Labor . Each organization has its good and bad points . The I. W. W. organizes industrially ; safeguards unskilled labor ( giv ing it an equal voice ) ; and encourages every worker to learn a trade . The A. F. of L. organizes by crafts ; does little for unskilled labor ; and prevents the learning of some trades . The I. W. W. asks no recognition by employers ; refuses to recognize them ; signs no agreements ; makes no effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured . The A. F. of L. demands recognition by employers ; recognizes them ; signs agreements with them for long periods ; enforces these agreements on the workers ; controls its members from unauthorized strikes and precipitate action ; and guarantees that settlements shall bring peace . Both organizations at times resort to violence , and both commit the economic folly of restricting output . The great divergence between them can be expressed in one sentence : The A. F. of L. is a responsible body . Never forget that ! It is selfish , shortsighted , unprogressive , and at times vicious , but it is the best thing that Labor has been able to evolve for collective bargaining . Sooner or later the labor of our mills , both skilled and unskilled , will have to be organized , but it must be a responsible organization , that shall permit no violence , stop the despotism of the closed shop , insure business stability through trade agreements , exact and observe high standards , and sanction no abuse of power or privilege by either side . The right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has accomplished more for the uplift of the workers than all the philanthropy we have evolved . The capitalist who does not admit the inherent fairness of collective bargaining really affirms that capital may combine into a huge unit , and that there is then no disparity in a bargain made between a large unit and an atom . Such a man is by his attitude hastening the day of social revolution . Let him read the story of the multiplied strike in England last June and July , and see the handwriting on the wall . The I. W. W. is merely the syndicalism of Europe , with its triple weapon of the multiplied strike , the sympathetic strike , and the general strike . It stands for war , but war without the Geneva Convention , and with no provision for the rights of noncombatants . It is private warfare , which the laws of civilization for centuries have prohibited . A conflict on a large scale is inevitably coming . Every public man in this country who has his ear close to the ground knows it is coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . Ask Colonel Roosevelt , if you follow him . Each will admit that the conflict is certainly coming if some radical step is not taken to check it . A recent Commissioner of Labor in New York State said to me not long ago , You may like the labor unions or not , but the time is coming when you will be grateful to them as the only thing that stands between you and anarchy . ' The need of the hour is clearly indicated . It is , as Mr. Brandeis points out , a great opportunity for conservative trade-unionism . The rioting at Lawrence reveals the I. W. W. tactics in normal operation , while the spectacle of a few thousand lawless strikers forcing many thousand peaceable persons out of an employment which they wish to pursue , is a glimpse of I. W. W. despotism . Haywood and Ettor are seemingly outraged at any attempt to curtail the right of free speech , yet they themselves deny to thousands of non-belligerents the right of free labor , which is vastly more important . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders without clearly explaining that these opinions do not for a moment apply to the Strike Committee at Lawrence . The reader must differentiate between the strikers themselves and an organization which merely used them as pawns in its attack upon the existing order . In the strictest sense the I. W. W. neither ordered the strike nor concluded it . The Strike Committee was composed in large part of men and women who deserved the highest respect for their sincerity , a real regard for their ability , and true admiration for their devotion to a cause . The Lawrence strike is ended , but we must not let it pass without learning some of its lessons . The fact of eighteen diverse nationalities among the workers in one mill has been , for the first time , shown to be no barrier to a perfect solidarity of brotherhood in a common cause . The bonus system as now practised in textile mills , while fair in theory , has certain vicious features which can not be countenanced . The way to make anarchism grow in this country is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a factory should not exempt stock-holders from all interest in the lives of their laborers . Finally , the presence in this nation of congested masses of vaguely-understood foreigners who absolutely refuse American standards of living should turn us to a careful consideration of our immigrant laws . The Lawrence strike has cost the community millions of dollars . It has caused suffering and privation to 50,000 persons , and it will later collect a grim toll through infant mortality . Yet if all this has brought but the single return of awakening public opinion to the dangers ahead , this wretched conflict has been a blessing in disguise .
