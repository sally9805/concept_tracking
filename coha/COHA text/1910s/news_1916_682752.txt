txt Our neighbor The A Gentle Sun presents as , an Smile astonishing product of Is Enough . . official minds an appeal made by the War Department for the addresses of certain people whose names it has on a list as those of aviators or persons in one way or another interested in aerial navigation by means of heavier-than-air machines . When one reads over this list and discovers that it contains dozens and dozens of . names well known to ' everybcdy with any interest at all in aviation  --  the names of men whose whereabouts are revealed almost daily by all the more important ' newspapers throughout the country  --  there Is , indeed , some excuse for surprise that even the least of Washington officials should ask anybody 's help in finding them . On further examination of the list , too , new cause for wonder appears , as it includes not only men already in the Government 's own service , but others who , being Alexicans or Japanese or Chinese , long since went home after learning to fly here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give us help in a military emergency . I In spite of these peculiarities , however , the sending out of the queer request is more interesting to the professional psychologist , who likes to dig around in mental subcellars , than to those of us ? the great majority  --  who , having noticed that certain human beings in certain conditions act in a certain way , are content to note the fact and let it remain unexplained . And fact it is that men who have long been subjected to what may be called bureaucratismus always have done , and probably always will do , everywhere , things Just like the sending out of a request for the addresses of aviattirs as well known as ? Rums WR/GHT , GLENN H. CURT/Ss , VINCENT ASTOR , LAWRENCE B. SPERRY , and Virson CARLSTROM . The underlying idea ? that of having on hand and available in the War Department the names of everybody who in case of need could hs called upon to help our little Aviation Corps  --  was a good and proper one , the product of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out or the plan was attempted that the bureaucratic mind worked after its familiar kind and injected the usual element of absurdity . " The addresses of all aviators are wanted . Some of them can be obtained only by outside assistance . It will be simple to get them all that way . " That was the way the subordinate official mind reasoned and acted . In spite of its " dryDelinquency ness " and other proStudied tective influences of . Kansas the statutory sort , in Kansas still has its share , or at any rate a share , of crimes and criminals . Why this should be so has been the subject of evidently earnest study by the members of the State Board of Correction . The board has to report only once in two years , so it could take its time in making its investigation , but the product of its labors is not very helpful . It seems , that in Kansas there are " two leading factors that enter into the crime record . " One of them Is " the large influx of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " the lamentable influence of unhappy family life . with divorces and separations , leaving helpless children to be creatures of the street and eventually wards of the State. ? ' The first of these factors is comprehensible enough , for settled , efficient and responsible men do not as a rule seek the brief employment of harvest hands , but as Kansas can not gather her own crops , or thinks she can not , she must continue to accept the natural delinquency thus invited within her virtuous borders . But is it true that in Kansas or elsewhere divorces and separations tend notably to cause children to grow up into erimtnals ? That conclusion does not obviously follow from the premises , for while the severing of marriage ties can not be good for the children thus deprived of the guidance which one or the other parent should give , the condition of the children in these cases Is conceivably improved from- what it would he if they remained the close observers and inevitable victims of parental quarrelings and hatreds . And are they any more unfortunate than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a father or mother , something that happens at least as frequently as do divorces and separations ? There is nothing original in saying that divorce does not break marriage , but simply recognizes and records the fact that marriage , properly so called , has come to an end . The truth is often forgotten , however , and apparently the Kansas officials quite ignored it . For a reason Which Indeed We qne can at least preDo Need tend to be mysterious , to Reform ! The ? Savannah News gets obvious satisfaction from recording and emphasizing the indubitable fact that though New Yorkers have not infrequently found or made occasion to criticise the inhabitants of . other States for deeds of lawlessness and violence , its own farmers , as well as its own street car men , are just now indulging in the same evil propensity . Hence , declares The News , as human nature is pretty much the same all over the country , " it ought to be plain to New York people now that they have plenty of room for reform at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticising Georgia when some Georgians misbehave . " But It . always has been plain to New York people that they were far from being any better than they should be , or even as good as they ought to be . They have made public confession of their sins innumerable times ? so often , indeed , that they have almost given warrant for the seemingly widespread belief , beyond the State lines , that New Ycrk , Band ' especially New York City , is abnormally wicked . But surely that does not preclude our observation and ? epeoval of transgressions like our own when they occur in ' Georgia or elsewhere . And it is not quite true that human nature is everywhere the same . New York human nature , for instance , is measurably , though slightly , less resentful of outside criticism and advice than id Georgian human nature . There are other small differences to be found by the attentive student of his kind , but only that one need be mentioned for present purposes .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
