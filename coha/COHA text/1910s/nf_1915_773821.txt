txt // background to our recent work ? we have abandoned the ideas of the atomistic school of the nineteenth century only to fall back on the doctrines formulated by Descartes in the seventeenth , as Sir Joseph Larmor has pointed out . To show this connection , it is necessary only to outline and contrast briefly these two methods of scientific procedure now , as I have already shown the tendencies of the atomistic school and shall give , in the next chapter , the ideas of Descartes . The followers of the atomistic school believe natural phenomena to result from the impact of atoms , possessing mass , figure or extent , indestructibility , and the inherent property of motion . Thus this idea , adopted by 11 uygcns , agrees in the main with that of Newton , except as it rejects his hypothesis of the occult power of attraction of atom for atom through space . With Descartes matter , as a distinct and separate entity , disappears altogether , and nothing is left but space and its variations . What we call pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ether , and material bodies are merely places of permanent variation in this plenum . From observing the persistence of whirlpools in water and in the air , Descartes ingeniously concluded that all space was filled with whirlpools or vortices of this plenum , each having an axis which passes through one of the stars . Unfortunately for the theory , these vortices and material variations of space soon became so compliTENDENCIES // cated as to destroy its value . In the last century the idea was revived by Lord Kelvin in his celebrated vortical theory of matter . He used only the main ideas of Descartes , and , from a better mathematical knowledge of the properties of vortices , was able to simplify their character and to account for many of the attributes of matter . We may then say that the dissimilarity in the two theories consists in the doctrine that empty space is a vacuum or an imaginary entity called the ether , as opposed to the postulate of Descartes that space is true material substance ; while both theories suppose that the smallest particles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be atoms , inherently indivisible and essentially different from space , but Descartes declared them to be variations of a substance , itself infinitely divisible , although they might not be further divisible by our present experimental ability . With this understanding of Descartes 's hypothesis , we are in a position to show how closely modern views of matter and electricity are concurring in this idea . From the large number of physicists now writing on the theory of physics , three names stand out prominently as originators of the modern conceptions of electricity and matter . Professor H. A. Lorentz , Sir Joseph Larmor , and Sir Joseph ' Thomson are certainly the men who will be most prominently associated with this movement ; others have aided , but mainly in the ex42 THE LIMITATIONS OF SCIENCE tension or modification of their ideas . And of the three , the most attention in an essay of this character , which attempts a general discussion of the philosophical basis of scientific theory , should he devoted to Professor Larmor 's ideas . In his treatise , ; Ether and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare example of a scientific theory with a philosophical background clearly expressed and discussed . The main thesis of his essay is that a purely mechanical theory of discrete atoms moving in empty space has failed to account for the phenomena of nature , and especially for the recent discoveries made in electricity . We may , however , by altering this conception of atoms , by separating electricity and matter into two entities , or even by considering matter as an attribute of electricity , again reconcile fact and hypothesis . Since Faraday 's time the drift of opinion has been in the direction of this separation , so that it is merely necessary to crystallize it into a definite scientific postulate . No idea of finality is expressed in Professor Larmor 's theory , since he thinks it should endure only so long as it agrees with facts in our possession ; on the other hand , he considers it not to be effective criticism to make a charge of incompleteness without indicating a better way , as an hypothesis may be valuable not only when imperfect , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument for the progress of natural philosophy . As an // instance of this , he states that many of the most important discoveries in light were made when the erroneous corpuscular theory was still in vogue . But does it necessarily follow that the theory prompted the discoveries or led to their investigation because they happened to be contemporaneous ? It is difficult to believe Bradley would have failed to obtain the relation between the aberration of light and its finite velocity if some other theory had been popular . Certainly the specific attributes assigned to light corpuscles would have little influence in promoting such discoveries , since it was the habit to modify these without much compunction if they did not square with observation . And we are supported in this opinion by Professor Larmor himself when he says : " At the same time all that is known ( or perhaps need to be known ) of the ether itself may be formulated as a scheme of differential equations , . . . which it would be gratuitous to further explain by any complications of structure " ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treating material media , based on merely empirical or speculative additions to the ascertained equations of free ether , had indeed been clearly recognized by von Helmholtz . " The questions , then , to he borne in mind while discussing these modern theories , are whether they involve speculative additions to our equations and explanations by complicated constructions , and whether they are // essential to the progress of science . I shall try to show that they are characterized by the same occult and unverifiable assumptions as the older theories and are really extra-scientific . Professor Larnior , in the beginning of his essay , recognizes that an hypothesis which supposes matter to be constituted of an immense number of . discrete particles moving in empty space and incapable of further subdivision has a philosophical objection too difficult to be overcome . In the first place , as Lord Kelvin pointed out , the chemical atom can not be the immeasurably small body sometimes claimed by metaphysicians . Both physical and chemical experience require the atom to be a real portion of matter occupying a finite space , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The chemical molecule may be decomposed into the atoms of hydrogen and oxygen , and now these atoms are in turn divided into subatoms . Even these also are by no means immeasurably small ; we are already calculating their size and their mass . And we can think of no reason why matter should have been created of this size rather than any other . These minute grains still have much individuality of their own in the way of attributes ; if electrified , their mass is supposed to change in quantity when they move , as does also their shape ; they must explain electrical attraction and repulsion , gravitational attraction , cohesion , and a probable molecular repulsion // known as elasticity ; they must have a propensity which makes them build geometrical crystals : in fact they must be arbitrarily and occultly endowed with all the attributes of ponderable'matter which they were created to explain . This sub-atom has many more duties to perform , but sufficient have been given to show that either it is excessively complex in essence or is endowed with complex forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the matter of subdivision , but it is merely a temporary makeshift . But there is a still more cogent reason for this philosophical objection than the empirical ones given . The equally fundamental concepts of space and time are invariably considered as continuous or infinitely divisible functions , and this theoretical difference assigned to matter , introduces inevitable trouble in mathematical analysis . The science of mechanics , in its theoretical aspect , may be defined as the attempt to apply the laws of geometry to real bodies , and while there is always an insurmountable break in thought between the laws of the imaginary bodies discussed in geometry and the concrete ones of mechanics , we can , by the assumption of the continuity and indefinite divisibility of matter , approximate as closely as we wish to the rigorous laws of geometry . The geometrical point and line are respectively abstract bodies of no , and of one , dimension ; in experimental mechanics , they are both real bodies of three dimensions , ? the point is the atom and the line // a succession of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physics , for while it deals with concrete bodies of real size , we eliminate by the abstractive method all the variations which result from the finite size of bodies and then discuss them as if they were theoretically simple bodies of no size . That is , we divide a body into infinitesimal portions and consider its effect as being due to the arithmetical sum of the effects of these parts . An example will make this clearer ; the attraction between two spheres , which is one of the fundamental problems of physics , can be solved rigorously only by the application of the principle of centers of inertia , that the attractive force of a sphere is the same as if its entire mass were concentrated at its mathematical center . As soon as we apply this law of attraction to real spheres , even of sub-atomic size , we introduce an appreciable error , since the attractive force then produces strains and a deformation of shape which reacts to change the force ; this error becomes negligible only when we consider matter to be continuous and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of indefinitely small particles . We are thus brought to this dilemma ; experimentally , matter is discontinuous and theoretically , it is continuous , ? hypothesis might be called the hopeless effort to reconcile these irreconcilables . Professor Larmor tries to avoid this pitfall , which has caught the originators of atomic theories , and atTENDENCIES // tempts to reconcile the antagonistic ideas of continuity and atomicity by placing himself squarely on the side of Descartes . He does not regard space as mere empty geometrical continuity . According to his notion , the universe is a plenum or ether ? that is , a continuous , frictionless fluid , everywhere uniform and quiescent . This plenum constitutes what he calls true matter . It is entirely unrecognizable by our senses and can not be brought to them by any experience . By such a metaphysical hypothesis we may account for the aberration of light and many other actions occurring in free space . To provide for ordinary or sensible matter , making it at the same time discontinuous in character , he supposes there exist in the plenum innumerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and humanly indivisible , and by their combination present to our senses all the phenomena making up for us the material universe . These discontinuities are free to move without disturbing the quiescence of the continuous medium , much as wind blows through a forest . By this supposition we account for the experimental fact that motion of matter does not affect the velocity of light in a vacuum . If , however , the discontinuities show unbalanced electrical force , then their motion causes real , although temporary , variations in the medium . The next requirement in his cosmogony is to specify what these variations in the supposititious plenum may // be . This is the vital step in any process of reasoning which attempts to link metaphysical assumption to physical experience . Once taken without challenge , a scientific theory may be developed logically . It is just at this point that the Lucretian atom and the Cartesian vortex fail . Here also Lord Kelvin failed . He proved that no finite force could either create his tiny vortex atom rotating in a frictionless medium , or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would act as if possessed of many of the essential properties of matter . But , in the process of elaboration , this atom , like all others , became unmanageable from complexity ; it failed to account for the electric charges of matter , and finally received a death-blow when Maxwell said a vortex ring might be an analogy to the atom , but at best was merely a mode of motion and not matter as we know it . How , then , is this new protoplasmic element of the universe to be defined so as to satisfy these criticisms , and at the same time avoid making the speculative mechanical structures in an ether , which Professor Larmor deprecates ? The founders of the new electrical theory of matter have studied profoundly the laws of nature . They have made many permanent acquisitions to our knowledge ; they have elaborated their theory with the greatest ingenuity , and yet the result has been to show that their theory is merely the same as the discarded ones , amplified and clothed in new names . The additional complexity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more comprehensive , will do more than the criticisms of its adversaries to hasten the time when physicists will frankly avoid metaphysical explanations and start from experimental axioms . In order to be exact when defining this new idea of the atom , I shall quote again from . /Ether and Matter : " The protion ( or sub-atom ) must therefore be in whole or in part a nucleus of intrinsic strain in the ether , a place at which the continuity of the medium has been broken and cen Tented together again ( to use a crude but effective image ) without accurately fitting the parts , so that there is a residual strain all round the place . " So far this might almost be interpreted as the specification for a vortex atom ; but , since such a type of strain fails to provide matter with electric charges , he diverges at this point and considers the " ultimate element of matter to be an electric charge or nucleus of permanent ethereal strain instead of a vortex ring . " When discussing these definitions , we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only , purpose of an atomic theory or of a mechanical model is to create a picture , however crude , of the constitution of matter . I can form absolutely no mental image of such a kind of matter as Professor Larmor proposes , and although I have discussed this new theory many times with its supporters , I have never found them able to give any clear and simple idea of such a strain ; it // is certainly unlike any that we have encountered in experimental mechanics or electricity . Let us strip the definition of technical intricacies , of such words as protions and ethereal electric strains , which have the power of confusing the mind and of making us accept statements we do not quite understand . In the first place , Professor Larmor 's hypothesis is purely an evasion of the old atomic theory . II is continuous , true matter which has absolutely no mechanical attributes and indeed none of any sort , except what he calls the ability to be modified by an electric charge , seems to me , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere extent or abstract geometrical space . Sensible matter which consists of discont inuous variations of this true matter , not of a mechanical nature but of what he calls electrical strains , is to me less substantial than extent or space ; for , as difficult as it may be , I can form some idea of space and I can communicate this idea to others , but I can make no mental picture of an electrical strain in a non-mechanical plenum ; and such a strain certainly does not impress me as being matter as I know it . I shall now form these ideas into a chain : space is substance ; matter is a variation or strain in substance ; a strain is an electric charge ; an electric charge is matter ; matter is substance ; therefore an electric charge and matter are both space , unless I can be persuaded that a variation of an entity can change its essence , which is absurd . This // is a rather complicated syllogism , so it is better to reduce it to simpler terms , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a plenum is that which is full of matter ; therefore matter is true matter . Such reasoning should convince anyone that , no matter how we may wrap up our logic , we can not explain those things which we must use as a means of explaining other phenomena . The ordinary man expresses this by the saying , we can not lift ourselves by our own bootstraps . Are not such hypotheses in the same class as perpetual motion and squaring the circle ? But even on the scientific side , this hypothesis is not satisfactory . Every theorist acknowledges that science is founded ultimately on our sense perceptions , and this fact should warn us that the attribute electricity is not a substance . The phrase , to electrify matter , has a well-defined meaning , because we know , by experience , that a body when rubbed exhibits a force which was not evident previously . We also know that we may select two different bodies , which will each show this electric force but of such opposite characteristics that their mere contact reduces the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this manifestation of electric force , so that if electricity were a substance we are reduced to this anomaly , that the addition of substance to substance may result in less substance . This attractive force is the simple and fundamental fact in regard to // electricity and it is not proper to avoid it by speculating on matter in a state so special and so removed from common experience as when it is radio-active or highly vacuous . Now experience teaches us'that matter added to matter is always more matter ; thus satisfying our prime requisite for substance . This difference between electricity and matter is sufficient to explain why the term electrified matter is a real idea , and why materialized electricity means nothing . There is no more justification for calling electricity a substance than there is for doing the same thing for any other attribute of matter , such as color or temperature . The simple fact that matter appeals directly to our sense organs and electricity does not should be sufficient to convince anyone that our interpretation of nature , because of our material and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foundation of material substance and not of electrical substance . The postulate of the objective existence of matter is a necessary hypothesis and that of electricity is not . Is it to be supposed that , because certain learned men find difficulty in explaining some of the obscure actions of matter , the human race is to cast aside an instinctive and universally accepted axiom , any more readily than it will discard the idea that the straight line is the shortest distance between two points ; that parallel lines never intersect ; or that all bodies require three , and only three , dimensions in order to locate them ; ? because a few modern geTENDENCIES // ometers choose to advance other and contradictory postulates as axioms ? Let us now turn to some of the specific difficulties of this new theory . In addition to many absurd properties ascribed to the old elastic solid ether , its chief defects were , that it must , at the same time , have friction and not have friction , and that it could not account for electricity . If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat energy , and the motion of bodies through it would affect the properties of light in a manner which could be detected ; both of these have been found to be contrary to experience . On the other hand , the ether must have friction to permit the communication of atomic vibrations to it . To escape these dilemmas , Professor Larmor supposes the electro-magnetic ether to be without mechanical friction and so to remain quiescent when any body moves through it , but he apparently forgot that he had assumed that the essence of substance is electricity . If bodies are forms of electricity how can they move through an electrical medium without disturbing it ? Since we have abandoned the theory that light and heat are mechanical waves for the supposition that they are electro-magnetic disturbances caused by periodic variations of electric charges , the new ether must , in some way , be modified by electric variations in order to receive and to transmit light and heat . But anyone can see we are just where we started . The electro54 THE LIMITATIONS OF SCIENCE magnetic ether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the electric atom and must be devoid of electro-magnetic friction so as not to absorb electro-magnetic waves when in transit . Again , he says the mechanical atom was defective , in that it could not account for electricity , but he also says that the electrical atom does not explain cohesion , weight , and , I might add , any other mechanical property . Which shall we choose ? Lastly , not to prolong the discussion , just as the mechanical ether and atom led us to such contradictory attributes as enormous rigidity and inappreciable density , so the electro-magnetic ether and atom require us to give the latter an electric force whose magnitude is to that of weight as ten raised to the forty-second power is to one . Temperamentally , Professor Thomson has little in common with his colleague , Professor l.arnwr ; as all know , we owe to him a long series of most delicate and profound experimental investigations in this field . Like Lord Kelvin , he is usually content to construct a model for each special phenomenon , and , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is difficult to form any consistent idea of his theory . He seems to regard matter as if it were a sort of buildingblocks which may be put together as fancy directs . His best-known conception of matter and electricity is his picture of an atom as a central sphere of uniformly // distributed positive electricity with points of negative electricity so placed in it as to form the corners of regular geometrical figures . He then calculates the stability of each figure from the mutual attractions and repulsions of the charges and supposes the chemical elements to be conditioned by this stability . The scheme is so frankly artificial and speculative that its author can regard it only as an architect does his sketch , as a symbol of a house . But in addition to his pictorial representations of matter and phenomena , which , if taken correctly , do not deceive anyone , he subscribes to the hypothetical method and is a leader in developing the electrical theory of matter . If we now turn to a consideration of the ideas of Professor Lorentz , we shall find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have been led to the conception of electrons or protions , Professor Lorentz says in his Theory of Electrons , by our desire to understand the electrical properties of matter . For , while we adopt the theory of Faraday and Maxwell that the space or electro-magnetic ether near an electrically charged body is put in a certain state of strain and never lose sight of this idea , yet we need not form an image of it and really can not say much about it . In fact , these strains , as imagined by them , can not have a real existence without producing motion in the ether , which is an impossible assumption . On account of the difficulties into which such speculations // lead us , there has been a tendency Of late years to avoid them altogether . But while this method is the safer one and provides us with a set of correct formulae and laws , yet we are compelled to introduce into these equations unknown terms , called coefficients , which express the individual properties of different kinds of ponderable bodies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects in iron and copper . If we wish to obtain a deeper insight into the properties of matter , lie says , we must not be satisfied with simply introducing for each substance its special coefficient , whose value is to be determined by experiment ; we must invent some hypothesis about the mechanism of matter which causes such differences of behavior . It is this necessity which has led us to the hypothesis of the electron . He then defines these electrons as extremely small particles , charged with electricity , and present in immense numbers in all ponderable bodies . They are of two kinds , positive and negative , and are free to move in conductors of electricity and bound to points of equilibrium in non-conductors . Sometimes he considers them to be rigid , and at other times as deformable bodies . Their inertia , or mass , is , for the most part , an effect of their electric charge , and the negative electron is probably free electricity without ponderable mass . Professor Lorentz assigns no specific properties to the ether , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the // electron . It is evident that the philosophical ideas of this theory are the same as those previously discussed . We are driven in both to the supposition that the electron is a space modification of a universal medium and that , in some way , neither electron nor ether is a material substance , but a kind of transcendental entity called electricity . Of course we wish to obtain a deeper insight into the properties of matter , and if we had discovered , or had any means of discovering , a method to such a knowledge , no amount of labor would be superfluous while making an hypothesis . But we wish many impossible things ; we should like to be satisfied about the immortality of the soul ; the causes and nature of life , and a host of other problems . Now Professor Lorentz says we know very little about the ether and the nature of matter , and by very little , he means.we know nothing . What advantage , then , does he propose , when he says : Come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us make an hypothesis that we may seem to obtain a deeper insight into the mysteries of nature ? He knows that the atom of iron is as mysterious as a ton of that substance , and that he does nothing to explain the nature of iron by giving imaginary properties to a sub-atom of iron ; he is aware that he has not touched the reason why iron differs from copper , and he ought to know that , by calling this subatom a particle of electricity , he has only added con58 THE LIMITATIONS OF SCIENCE fusion to our ignorance . What would he say of a biologist who , growing tired of describing forms of life which he can handle , gave the habits and appearance of marine animals living beyond the reach of his dredging nets ? The security of experimental science rests on the belief that , for the honor of science , no one will tamper with what he has actually observed . Why should more leniency be granted the theorist , why should he be allowed to mix fact and fancy , law and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to account ? It is just this restraint , this distinguishing between what we know and what we desire , that constitutes the value of science as a discipline of the intellect ; and in the exercise of this restraint lies our intellectual integrity . The gospel of science , for it has one as truly as has religion , may be summed up in the words of Goethe : " in restraint first shows himself the master . " What has it come to , when we can pass over such false methods with a shrug ? Huxley spent his life , in season and out of season , waging battle with bishops and laymen to convince them that religious belief and religious theory must square with objective fact . And he assured them that men of science could provide a foundation of truth , and would not impose a false one , so that all men might know and have a rational basis of life and belief . And how have we kept the faith ? We have given with equal emphasis our speculations and our observations . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain path because he has warned us in the beginning of his treatise that he is dealing with glittering hypothesis . He takes all the force out of the warning by using his genius to overlay his speculations with a specious appearance of reality . Let him try the opposite plan and actually convince a class of students and educated men generally that his hypothesis does not , and can not , give any real insight into the actual properties of matter , that he is talking in a Pickwickian sense , and how much serious attention would he attract ? No , the world still believes in the restraint of men of science and in their boast that they will submit our vague longings to the test of experience . And it will be a bad day for science if this belief is destroyed . Nor is it proper to adopt an attitude of indifference to these hypotheses as many experimentalists do , to pass them by with a shrug or with the statement that they cause little harm to the growth of science , however little they may aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this indifference would be well enough , but science is increasingly considered to be a guide to conduct . We have no right to approve the intellectual carelessness which has been so vividly expressed by M. Poincare in the preface to his Theorie de la Lumiere : " It matters little to us whether the ether really exists ; that is the business of the metaphysician to find out ; the essential thing for us is that 6o THE LIMITATIONS OF SCIENCE everything acts as if it existed ? ' and that this hypothesis is convenient in explaining phenomena . After all , have we any other reason for believing in the existence of material objects ? Is not that belief also a convenient hypothesis ; only we shall never cease to make it , meanwhile the time will come , without doubt , when the ether will be rejected as useless . " Both material objects and the ether may be only hypotheses , or rather our knowledge of them is relative , but not in the same way ; the existence of material objects is based on direct experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may argue , the objective reality of matter is a necessary idea , fixed in our minds and not to be dislodged . Criticism is now often directed against the older atomic theory because a given form of it no longer accords with phenomena which have been lately discovered . And it should be borne in mind that this new theory of electrons has been developed with the main purpose of supporting the atomic theory and making it agree with our new knowledge of electricity . Thus Professor Rutherford has recently performed a beautiful experiment by which he detects electrically a portion of helium gas , which he calculates to be of the dimensions of a chemical atom . Here , he says , we have at last an actual experimental proof of the reality of the chemical atom . Does not this experiment show just the reverse ? The idea underlying all atomic TENDENCIES OF MODERN PHYSICS 6r theories is that the indivisible unit of matter is so small that it can be dealt with experimentally and mathematically in aggregates only . So when he devises an apparatus so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size of the so-called chemical atom , he forces us to adopt for the real atom a smaller unit whose individual variations will be beneath our observation . The unit of matter becomes just one degree further removed from matter as we know it . Instead of squaring our hypotheses with the sensible properties of matter , we may thus more easily make matter a purely transcendental quantity which we create according to our own imaginations . Would it not be better frankly to say the material universe is merely a world of ideas , an embodiment of intangible motion , energy , and electricity , rather than to keep up the fiction that the electron is the ultimate unit of sub-stance ? Apparently the chemical molecule is a well-defined point in the regular divisibility of matter where certain physical apparatus , as the balance , fail to record variations in so small a body ; but , by the use of chemical appliances , we are able to take note of still smaller masses , which have been named the atoms of the chemical molecules . At this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recourse to the electrification of the gaseous atoms by the X-rays or by radium , and can then detect variations in these // particles by means of the electroscope . These smaller portions of matter are called electrons or sub-atoms , and for the time being we have rested here . But would anyone say that new methods of analysis and new apparatus of registration are an impossibility , and that the electron will not in future be divided ? On the other side of the series the mote , dancing in the sunbeam and disappearing when the light fails it , is an indivisible atom to the unskilled man deprived of sensitive apparatus . The fact is , the atom as an objective unit of matter has no existence ; we name that portion of matter an atom when we have reached a limit of appreciation of matter by our most sensitive apparatus . If these fundamental and irrational assumptions of plenum and sub-atom be once granted , then a mechanical explanation of many of the phenomena of nature follows logically . But this is also true if we postulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , air , fire , and water ; and one has only to recall the success of Descartes with his three elements . The question is , are the postulates true ? If we can not verify them by experiment , then science should reject them . On this criterion the sub-atom is as vulnerable as any other postulate . The conclusions , deduced , may give a truly mechanical explanation ; for , in spite of denying the existence of matter in the beginning , the substitute electricity is at once endowed with all the essential characteristics of the discarded // matter , such as inertia , conservation , gravitational attraction , extent , etc . Certain additional properties add to its conquests , since , by splitting up the atoms , a new set of pawns is available to the players of this game of probability and chance . The diversity of the chemical elements may be said to result from the various stable combinations which the sub-atoms may be made to assume . Professor Rutherford developed his ingenious theory of radioactivity by supposing certain elements to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion of their atoms explodes continuously , reducing the atomic weight of the parent body , and supplying the spontaneous energy noted experimentally . This process continues until a stable form is reached . But does he not forget that one of the triumphs of the old atomic theory , a proof that the chemical atom could never be divided into sub-atoms , was that when an unstable compound , like gunpowder , exploded , the constituents were found to be stable chemical atoms ? The phenomena of electricity are naturally the main problems attacked . A current of electricity in this new hypothesis becomes the flow of immaterial particles of electricity in a metal conduit , carrying with them their energy of motion . In non-conductors , like glass , they may be heaped up into an excess of positive or negative to provide a picture of the free charges on such substances . Radiant light , heat , and electricity are // the periodic disturbances produced in the plenum by the oscillatory motions of the same particles about fixed centers . These are said to be useful ideas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything more than to reaffirm the statement that a current of electricity under certain conditions flows through a wire , when we say a stream of charged particles moves through the wire ? In the first place , we create the particles , and next endow them with an occult power of motion . Again , when zinc and copper are placed in contact and separated , the zinc becomes positively charged with electricity , the copper with negative , and the two attract each other . Do we learn anything more when we affirm that an excess of positive electrical particles passes into the zinc and negative ones into the copper ? Why should they act so ? In both cases we have merely stated an unknowable cause in different words . The law remains the same whether we say electricity or electrical particle , and the former term expresses less pretense of knowledge . Far more significant , and less justifiable even , is the attempt to explain the mass of a body as an attribute of electricity . Mathematical analysis shows that an electrically charged body , moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater than when not so charged . Now , they say , continually diminish the ponderable mass of the body and maintain the electric charge constant ; the electro-magnetic mass , as this // effect of electricity is called , becomes proportionately greater and greater . Continue this process indefinitely , and at last all the matter is gone , and there remains a free electric charge , an immaterial point of electricity , moving and possessing inertia or mass . And just here lies the greatest danger of all such hypothesis ? a total confusion of fact and fancy . In the first place , it is not even based on experience , since the most rapidly moving bodies of a sensible size have a velocity far too little to make this effect noticeable . But , what is more important , it is a method of thought to be used with the utmost caution even in experimental processes . The warning against such extra-polation is metaphor-ically displayed in every physical laboratory . How we would scorn the unscientific conclusions of the meta-physicist who reasoned in the same way ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of small , as well as of large men ; now diminish the size of a man and let his quality of goodness remain con-stant , then we shall have an entity , concrete goodness , left when the man shrinks to nothing . It is not neces-sary to use such an absurd example , as a parallel case exists in physical phenomena . A sphere , moving in a fluid , experiences a like increase in apparent mass , due to the necessity of imparting energy to the fluid . Now decrease continually the density or mass of the body and maintain its volume and velocity constant ; the hydrodynamic mass becomes proportionately // greater . Continue this process until the matter is all gone , and there is left a sphere of something with an apparent mass still moving through the fluid . Will it not be difficult to persuade anyone that the something moving did not vanish simultaneously with the material sphere ? that the attribute did not vanish with the entity ? It will be just as hard to convince the future scientist , when the vogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains after the electrified matter is reasoned away . Such ideas leave us in the same foolish state as the hunters of the Snark , who , after incredible labors , came to the place where a Snark should be , and found it was a Boojum which vanished silently away . If I am correct in believing the fallacy to lie in trying to explain natural laws , it is not pertinent to inquire further into the working of this electrical hypothesis . The essential point is whether physics has anything to do with the nature of matter and electricity . Atoms and ethers of any kind are metaphysical creations ; the mechanical models built on such an unsubstantial foundation require a god to set them going , and are , at best , an ineffectual means of describing phenomena previously observed , and not finger-posts to new discoveries . The claim , that such arguments as this are ineffectual criticism because they tend to destroy the scientific method most used and offer nothing better in its stead , // is frequently made by scientific theorists who recognize the artificiality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , they tend to good . They forget that the growth of science has always been largely due to the discovery and the elimination of error . If we wish to make a garden , the first necessity is to clear away the weeds , and the same is true of science ; it is as important to know what is wrong as what is right . But even this claim is not correct , the better method is known and is in use . Have they forgotten the work of Galileo , of Newton , of Franklin , and of many others , who employed the abstractive method , or , at least , kept their hypotheses well in the background ? Nor is it difficult , if one studies the history of physics , to outline the basis of a method in harmony with my ideas , as I shall do in a later chapter . Nothing has been more convincing to me of the advantages of the abstractive over the hypothetical method than a study of Descartes 's Principia Naturae . Modern theorists have acknowledged their debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen from the discussion of Descartes 's system which follows . A comparison of his postulates and conclusions with those of our modern theory shows them to be almost identical , if we change his antiquated knowledge and his discarded metaphysical language into modern terminology . And lastly we should compare Descartes with modern physicists ; his knowledge of the phenom68 THE E LIMITATIONS OF SCIENCE little has been accomplished in that field in two DESCARTES AND HIS INFLUENCE ON RECENT SCIENCE ena and laws of nature is insignificant , so great has been our progress in this respect , but as a metaphysicist he is still the master of modern scientific hypothesis , so little has bR een accomplished in that field in two hundred years . t CHAPTER III DESCARTES AND HIS INFLUENCE ON RECENT SCIENCE De s'egarer avec methode. ? MIcaELEr . IF it be true that the permanent advances made in science have been the result of observing phenomena and of classifying them in laws which are as often as possible to be expressed by mathematical formulae ; and if it be also true that we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without really advancing knowledge ; then it will be most useful to compare our present state with that of an earlier time . For this purpose , I have chosen to sketch the scientific system of Descartes . In the first place , there can be no doubt as to the enormous increase in our positive knowledge of phenomena and natural laws since his time ; the difference is so great that there is no need to dwell on it . And yet , if we consider the history of Descartes 's hypothetical cosmogony , we learn that it was discarded only to have a revival at the present time . The advantage of reviewing the system of Descartes is all the greater because it seems apparent that many of those who are quoting his authority have not an accurate knowledge of what he taught . 69 // So far as I can see the hypothetical method has its most illustrious example in Descartes , and instead of aiding us to gain real and clear ideas , he has burdened science with useless and complicated metaphysical systems . Instead of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits of science comes rather from a certain intellectual cowardice which refuses to acknowledge the truth , that we can not attain any knowledge of things themselves but only of their attributes as they affect our senses . If we really face the question ; strip our scientific hypotheses of their technical phraseology and complex logic , and try to get a clear and simple idea of what they mean , we find that we have been deceiving ourselves . In the first place , we use words , which ordinarily convey definite ideas , in a sense purely symbolical , and then confuse the image and the reality . For example , when we define space or the ether as a perfect fluid , we deceive ourselves into believing that we have gained a clearer idea of space by applying to it a term which signifies the mobility of matter . But this attribute can be applied only to a material fluid whose change of position may be measured , and such a fluid appeals to us as something essentially different from immaterial space . Nor do we overcome this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluid is perfect which satisfies the laws of its nature , and we practice deception when we inject the ethical meaning of perfect , as being someINFLUENCE // thing above ordinary criticism , into the scientific definition of a fluid . We have also constructed a symbolic language , called mathematical analysis , whose characters and terms are so removed from ordinary speech that it imposes on our minds an impression of not being limited by the bounds of logic . Thus , if we derive a mathematical formula for the quantity of heat or electrical energy which passes through free space , we deceive ourselves by thinking that we have an expression not only for a quantity of energy , but that also we have in some unaccountable way gained a knowledge of the nature of energy and of the attributes of space . And we slur over the scientific axiom , that since these mathematical symbols did not express in the beginning something concrete , they can not after any manipulation give a result which is other than imaginative . Again , we postulate some entity such as matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to derive logically from it all the phenomena of nature , and ignore the plain fact that nature , as a whole , reveals itself to us as a succession of events , either not connected at all in a logical sequence of cause and effect , or at least in such an intricate tangle as to defy our powers of analysis . During the last two decades , there have been discovered an unusually large number of physical phenomena , and it is no exaggeration to say that we have mastered them with surprising rapidity and with great // ingenuity . At the same time we have turned to these new manifestations of matter and energy with the hope that in them we have at last found the materials for a new and lasting scientific cosmogony . But the edifice differs in appearance only from that built long ago by Descartes ; and the materials in both are the same , changed in name but not in substance . By a scientific cosmogony , as distinguished from revelation and from metaphysics , is here meant that we first postulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few in number and inherent in this entity , and that then the universe , as it now exists , follows as the result of the continued action of these forces on this substance . That is , the state of the universe may be expressed at any time subsequent to the initial action of the forces by a set of mathematical or verbal formulae . And if we could actually , as we can theoretically , reverse the action of these forces in time and in direction , the primal condition of the universe would again result . It is furthermore postulated that this archetypal substance existed originally in the form of minute particles , separate from each other and exactly similar in character , and that the forces acting on these particles were in such perfect balance that the total value of their effect was zero . From some cause , generally unexplained , this balance was destroyed and , like a clock // when its pendulum has once been jogged , the panorama of cosmical history unrolls itself inexorably . Thus the universe becomes a sort of machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motive force , but by the mutual reactions of its parts , and so destined in time to run down when this internal and available energy shall have exhausted itself . And when we speak of the universe , all that part of it designated as living bodies and vital forces is to be included , because of the belief that they also can be considered as ponderable masses subject to physical and chemical forces . As an original hypothesis the work of Lucretius is of no consequence . In fact his atomic theory was taken almost entirely from Democritus , and it was rather by the vision of the poet than by the logical analysis of the man of science that he developed these ideas into a picture of the nature of our world . His theory was , in brief , that the universe contained in an otherwise empty space an indefinite number of indivisible and immeasurably small particles , called atoms , which differed only in size , position , and shape . These atoms were indestructible and by their combination and separation formed all natural bodies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces but was an inherent property of their nature . With a common impulse , they all moved toward the center of the universe , but in addition they possessed an individual // power of irregular deflexion which introduced variety in matter . By their union they formed bodies ; and by their impact and rebound they caused vortical motions which now find expression in our term , energy . As an explanation of natural phenomena the theory has no value , as it originated long before the mathematical laws of forces had been formulated or the phenomena of matter had been accurately observed ; but as a guide to thought it has been the basis of must of the later scientific theories . Gradually elaborated by Gassendi , Newton , Boyle , Kant , Laplace , Dalton , and others , this atomic theory is still the touchstone of modern chemistry and physics . Possibly the vastest consequence of the atomic theory is the nebular hypothesis developed independently by Kant and Laplace . Essentially this theory is a restatement of the ideas of Demucritus and Lucretius , yet the discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravitation permitted for the first time a true scientific method . Thus , while they were compelled to assume , as arbitrarily as did Lucretius , an initial state of chaos when matter was scattered in atomic masses throughout space , they nevertheless had a cause when for any reason the original balance of forces was disturbed , experimentally verified and mathematically expressed , to account for the gradual agglomeration of atoms into larger masses at definite places , from the fact that any two masses of sensible // size were known to have a mutual attraction varying inversely as the square of the distance between their centers . The active attribute of matter , ruling and guiding its motion , thus became independent of fancy and subject to experimental verification . The nebular hypothesis has remained more or less a fragment , limited to the determination of the sizes , masses , and positions of celestial bodies and systems . Neither Kant nor Laplace , except for a discussion of temperatures , included in their scheme of the evolution of inorganic matter the causes of the complex forms and forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor beyond assuming that matter was determined by mass and an inherent power of attraction , did they make any attempt to explain how this occult force acted through a distance . And from this simplified idea of matter without variety and without complexity , they were able to deduce mathematically and logically the idea of the evolution of cosmical matter , from a condition of primitive distribution , at least to its segregation into cosmical systems : suns , planets , and satellites . And if we remember that Kant approached the problem from the standpoint of the metaphysician and Laplace from that of the pure mathematician , we can readily understand why they both were satisfied to take such an abstract view of the universe , and also the simplicity and the insufficiency of such a method . Astronomy is the one science , because of the comparatively enormous // magnitude of its units , which permits such an abstract simplification of matter as to consider it merely in the form of masses concentrated at mathematical points . Where we deal with bodies measured in millions of tons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are found in the laboratory sink into comparative insignificance and we can deal with averages instead of particulars . On the whole their attempt was a success since we can find few flaws in the general conception of a nebular hypothesis , however we may differ as to details . And just because the phenomena discussed are so few in number and so general in character , there was not the need for supposititious causes and fictitious attributes , provided we grant their initial state of the universe and the first cause contributing to irregularity and the beginning of motion . These postulates are of course entirely arbitrary and require us to assume an existence previous to time , since time has no meaning in a universe which is everywhere in a state of perfect equilibrium and rest . Undoubtedly the reason why this hypothesis persists in its principal features to the present time , in spite of constant attacks , is just because its authors exercised selfrestraint , holding to general laws and avoiding specific details . Some form of cosmical evolution is now generally granted and the heavens are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hope that accurate measurement will show that these apparently // chaotic masses are slowly changing into the more stable form of stellar systems . Side by side with the belief in atoms , separated from each other in empty space , had grown up the directly contrary idea that substance is continuous and space is a plenum . This doctrine permits us to make no essential difference between space and matter . Space becomes a continuous substance unvaried , and so imperceptible to our senses , while matter is merely a localized variation of this same substance of such a nature as to make it perceptible . And it is significant of these two systems , that although they begin with contradictory premises , they both lead to the same conclusions after apparently rigorous deductions . The doctrine of continuity owes its rise to Heraclitus and , amongst the Greeks , was most highly developed by Aristotle . They announced this postulate because the notion that a body can attract another through an intervening vacuum and cause it to move introduces an occult or inexplicable idea . Our experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact between bodies actually in contact . But it is quite evident , that in refusing to accept a force which acts contrary to our experience , which all goes to show that a material link is necessary to produce motion between bodies , they fell into as serious a difficulty , for they were compelled to create an occult substance to serve as the material link between bodies , and occult // variations in it for the bodies themselves . As explanations of phenomena both ideas are occult , but not to the same degree . We know , for a fact , that there is an attractive force between bodies of sensible size , although we can not explain its cause , and we can in our imaginations transfer a like form to bodies of an insensible size with some probability of truth . But the postulation of a plenum of continuous substance and of variations in it , which affect us as matter , is wholly occult since we have no experience from sensible matter to guide us ; in fact , both plenum and its variations always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our senses . The history of scientific theory is a record of the conflict between these rival ideas of continuity and discontinuity of substance . While the atomistic school has frequently had the advantage , since the time of Descartes the doctrine of the continuity of matter has persisted in some form , and at the present time is again established as the basis of physical theory . Nevertheless , the cosmical system as deduced by Descartes from this hypothesis of a plenum has suffered shipwreck and comparatively few think it profitable to study it in detail . Before we adopt his principles and discard his conclusions , it is at least advisable to see whether his errors lie in the principles themselves or in the inability of Descartes to derive true conclusions from correct principles . Fortunately , we have in the // Discours de la Mcthode , in the Principia Naturae , and in the many letters of Descartes an unusually complete record of his principles , his method , and his conclusions . In character , training , and opportunities , few if any philosophers have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been said of him , " he is a type of that spirit of science to which erudition and all the heritage of the past seem but elegant trifling . " He believed and acted on the opinion that no scientific knowledge is attainable unless men doubt ; unless they put aside authority and rely on their own experience . Descartes has in his Principia Naturae set forth with specious simplicity the causes , laws , and the phenomena of the universe as he finds them . Geometry is to be the ruler or at least the vicegerent , and no substance will be discussed except such as may be divided , figured , and moved according to the laws which geometers hold to govern quantity , nor will any proposition be considered proved unless it has been deduced with such evidence as would suffice for a mathematical demonstration . With vexatious inconsistency , he then destroys the force of this admirable introduction by carefully warning us not to consider his premises true or his conclusions conformable to fact , since his scheme is really an hypothesis or supposition as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is usually attributed to his fear lest he should 8o THE LIMITATIONS OF SCIENCE arouse the hostility of the Church and suffer a penalty similar to that which had just overwhelmed Galileo . His own plea was that he valued peace more than the spread of his opinions and also that he had always been a good Catholic and bowed to the authority of the Church , even when its decrees were contrary to his reason . But it is also possible that doubts arose in his own mind as his system developed and that when he found it necessary to compromise with the rigorous principles he had announced , he tried to disarm criticism by the plea that after all he was really concerned only with a fictitious world . At all events , while the laws of the heavens were under consideration , he permitted this veil of unreality to remain very thin ; for he knew the Church wisely allowed considerable latitude of thought concerning those regions of space which apparently contained no subjects to Catholicism , and he felt scientifically safe in a field where verification by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case was altered when he came to discuss terrestrial laws and phenomena , for here both Church and experience held sway and must be conciliated . In this field Descartes , mindful probably of both of these perils , relied on the same hypothesis , but to placate the Church he insisted that it was to be understood only in a most figurative sense , because we know that God created the earth , finished and perfect , as revealed in the Mosaic account ; INFLUENCE ON RECENT SCIENCE 8i and to disarm scientific criticism , his postulates he declared to be fictions , but in some way without departing from correct mathematical deductions , his conclusions were similar to experience . It would be difficult to understand from these contradictory statements what was Descartes 's real opinion of his scheme . But he has this answer in another part of his Principia , an answer which carries conviction . Since we have an idea of perfection , we have also the certainty of the existence of God , or an all-perfect Being . And because this God is justice itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the consequences are founded on mathematical laws , and if the deductions agree ' with experience , it would be ascribing injustice to God to believe that the causes of the effects are false . Now observe how far Descartes believes he has fulfilled these conditions : " je ne pense pas qu'on doive recevoir d'autres principes en la Physique , ni mesme qu'on ait raison d'en souhaiter d'autres , que ceux qui sont icy expliquez . " Descartes has recorded for us how he arrived at the postulates from which he developed his natural laws . Having previously laid aside preconceived ideas , he found that to doubt is the first and only means of knowledge ; we can doubt the existence of everything except that which doubts , therefore that which doubts or thinks , exists . Whence he derives the principle that our thoughts and the things we have an idea of , // are real and objective to us . However , by such a process we do not obtain a knowledge of things themselves , but only of their attributes . Hence , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our conception of all phenomena , and there should be some one essential attribute which may be used to designate things in general . Thus hardness , while it is an attribute , is not essential , for a body moving at the same speed as ourselves does not give us the sensation of hardness . After careful consideration he found that simple extent in length , breadth , and thickness is the one attribute common and essential to all matter . Not only is this true , but the extent of matter is identical with the extent of space : " The same extent in length , breadth , and thickness , which constitutes space , constitutes a body ; and the difference between them lies in this , that we attribute to a body a particular and limited extent which changes position with the body as it moves , and that we attribute to space an extent so general and so vague that when we remove from a certain space the body which occupied it we do not think we have transported the extent with it ; meanwhile the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same figure , and has changed position with respect to the body only as we determine position by other bodies . " The reason , according to Descartes , why we have been led to believe that substance is different from // space , and that it consists of atoms either in a vacuum or in a non-material medium , is the property known as expansion and contraction . As an illustration , he instances a sponge , which changes size but not character when its pores are filled with water . Here we have a change of size from the change of position of spongematter , the two kinds being of the same essence . So the change of volume of any body is due to a change of position of matter-substance produced by a change of space-substance , which also are essentially the same and differ only in accidental qualities . Furthermore , since we can not imagine a space so great that there can not be a greater , or so small that it can not be divided , then as matter is essentially the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent and indefinitely divisible . This is a very complicated way of getting back to one 's starting point . He says first , that substance is extension and then that space is extension , but since extension is everywhere and space is nowhere vacuous , a body is a body . Having discussed the nature of matter in general , he then finds that diversity in matter and also its differentiation from space can consist only in variations of position and motion of small parts of space which are themselves exactly similar . As corollaries to this definition , it follows that there can be neither absolute position nor absolute motion . To determine the posi84 THE LIMITATIONS OF SCIENCE tion and motion of a body we must use some other body as a point of reference . But in this system , all space is capable of motion and , in fact , is in rapid motion , and with no possible stationary reference point all positions and motions are merely relative . This question of abso-lute motion has been the subject of much discussion in the last few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granting a luminiferous ether , it must be absolutely stationary . And experiments have been de-vised to determine whether we can measure the absolute velocity of matter with respect to the ether . As in all experiments involving the ether , the results are nugatory . Nor , in the theory of Descartes , can there be action at a distance , for matter is continuous and all motion is the result of a push or impact . Motion , therefore , he defines as the transference of a part of matter or of a body from the neighborhood 3f those which touch it immediately , and which we consider at rest , to the neighborhood of others . And since all space is full of matter , or rather is matter , each body is so fashioned that it can never occupy a greater or a less space , nor can any other body occupy the space while it is there ; therefore if a body move to another position , it must displace an occupant ; and this , another ; so that every motion results iii a closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left by its previous occu-pant. // These postulates of Descartes , that space is a plenum and motion the result of an impact , required him to oppose such theorists as Gassendi who were advocating the atomic theory and an occult attractive force in matter as its cause of motion . It thus became of prime importance for him to formulate laws of impact and motion . This was an extremely difficult problem , especially so as the available knowledge of the phenomena of impact and motion was very deficient and , such as it was , indicated that friction produced an uncompensated diminution of velocity . With great care and in minute detail , he announced such laws as would , in his opinion , maintain constant the total quantity of motion or momentum of the universe in spite of friction . That is , such laws as would transfer the loss of motion of one body by impact to an equivalent increase of another . These laws are : God in his omnipotence created matter with motion and rest . If a body move twice as fast as another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two is the same . All bodies , which move , tend to move in straight lines and can change their direction only by encountering others . If a moving body strike another of greater momentum ( plus fort ) than itself , it loses none of its motion and if it strikes another with a less momentum // ( plus foible ) which it can move , it loses as much motion as it gives to the other . Then seven other laws of impact of less importance follow , which it is not necessary to quote , as Huygens later showed that all eight were , for the most part , erroneous . In spite of the fact that Descartes , without verification , invented the laws of motion of bodies and of their impact , yet we must recognize that he sought and found one of the great scientific principles ; that unless the universe is tending to a state of uniform rest through dissipation of motion by friction , some active property of matter must be conservative in addition to its quantity . While his particular law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is undoubtedly the progenitor of the law finally enunciated by von Helmholtz and now generally accepted , that the total quantity of energy remains constant . With these general principles settled , the nature of space and matter , and its conservation of quantity and action , we shall defer criticism and describe the various kinds and phenomena of matter as nearly as possible in the sense of Descartes . We are to suppose that , in the beginning of time , God divided all space or substance into equal parts , which , contrary to the chaos pictured by poets and philosophers , had been previously in perfect uniformity and rest . Out of these primordial particles of space // were fashioned all the small constituent parts of matter which now compose not only all terrestrial and celestial bodies but also the interstellar spaces . While we do not know the actual size of these particles , as they were originally or as they are now after they have suffered changes , some growing smaller by division and others larger by the accretion of many into one from causes which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been the exact average of all the constituent particles now comprising the universe . God also caused these primordial particles to move , and with equal force in two diverse fashions : each to rotate about its own center to form the constituent elements of the interstellar spaces , or , as Descartes calls them , the fluid body of the heavens , and many to revolve together about common axes , creating vortices whose centers are the nuclei of the sun and fixed stars in the heavens . The velocity of this uniform motion was the average of all the diverse motions existing now , so that the quantity of motion or momentum has remained constant throughout all time . Although these primordial particles were of equal size and motion , they could not have been spherical in shape , since a pile of spheres does not fill a space and there must be no vacuum . But whatever their initial figure may have been , they have in the course of time become exact spheres . The cause of this change of shape is , that the force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiently great to separate thciu from each other , and was therefore great enough to knock off their angular edges and corners because of the concussions of their future impacts . The result of such a constant attrition is well known to be that the body approaches the figure of a sphere , just as the pebble on the seashore becomes round from the grinding of the waves and its fellows . This action gives rise to three forms of matter which constitute the universe , and whose various forms of aggregation and proportions of mixture , with their resulting varieties of motion , account for all the diversified kinds and attributes of matter and space . The first kind of matter is the cosmic dust of attrition or the little fragments resulting from the above mentioned collisions . They are excessively small and have acquired enormous velocities , because the larger particles , from which they were split off , have constrained them to move faster than themselves through the narrow and tortuous paths formed by their interstices , just as air in a whistle moves the faster , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also so numerous , so various in size , and so irregular of shape , that there are always sufficient of them ready to hand to fill exactly any space which might otherwise be left vacuous by the arrangement and motion of their parent sphericules . The second elementary kind includes all the rest of // matter and space , whose least parts are spheres and smaller than any body we know , but they are much larger than matter of the first kind . There is also a third kind of matter formed by con-glomerate masses of the other two kinds , which have become so linked and interlaced together as to be in-separable , at least by human means . The pores of these masses are filled with the spheres of the second kind and the fragments of the first kind . The first kind of matter forms the sun and the fixed stars ; the second kind is the material for the so-called empty spaces of the heavens ; and the third is the basis of the diversified bodies composing the earth , the planets , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origi-nally endowed with two kinds of motion : the rotation of each particle about its own axis and the revolution of many about a common axis , forming a vortex or whirlpool . Descartes then portions out the heavens so that the axis of a vortex will pass through the center of each star , including the sun . The outer limit of each vortex extends so far in every direction as to touch the confines of each of the neighboring star-vortices ; in this manner all space is occupied by them , rushing about their several axes with a velocity de-creasing as the distance from the axis increases . It is naturally a problem of great intricacy to place these immense vortices so that they will not interfere with // each other 's motion , and he spends much labor and great ingenuity in describing the possible inclinations of axes and directions of motion of such a system , but not satisfactorily . The sun and stars , as they now are , were not created contemporaneously with the vortices but were a gradual growth from them . When more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vortex than was sufficient to fill the interstices of this matter , it began to flow toward the center and along the axis of the vortex , gradually forming there a nucleus , tres subtil et tres liquide ; namely , a luminous star . According to Descartes 's idea , which in spite of his contempt for authority he borrowed from Aristotle and the schoolmen , these stellar masses , consisting of matter of the first kind exclusively , are pure celestial fire , which is thus an entity and of all things the most fluid and so violently agitated as to be able to disintegrate the most solid bodies . Fire of itself does not need to be replenished but only seems to need replenishment , because the particles of a terrestrial fire are constantly flying away and being dissipated , and so must be renewed by others derived from the pores of gross combustible bodies and of air ; but in celestial fires there is no need of external replenishment because the steady stream of fire-substance , flowing of its own accord to the center of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spectroscope should show us that our sun // and the stars are not this pure elemental fire but merely heated matter of a terrestrial nature . Such havoc does experiment play with a grandiose hypothesis . We may , however , pass over difficulties impossible to have been foreseen by Descartes , since many men of science still think an hypothesis valuable if it escapes contemporaneous troubles , and of these there are always an abundance . Between these star centers lie the great interstellar spaces which some believe to be vacuous but which Descartes supposes are packed with matter of the second kind . The interstices , which would otherwise exist between these little spheres , are filled with matter of the first kind . And all together they rush around common axes to form the vast heavenly vortices with a velocity enormous but less than that of the celestial fire of the stars . This accounts for all the universe except those parts occupied by terrestrial and planetary bodies , which are composed mostly of matter of the third kind . The constituent parts of this kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other two kinds , whose pores are filled with matter of the first and second kinds still in their simple state . According to the relative proportions and various arrangements of these three constituents , we distinguish all the different bodies which are classed as solids , liquids , and gases . Of these , solid bodies are those whose least // parts are made of closely packed and intricately arranged particles , which can move with respect to each other but very slightly , if at all . The spaces between the constituent parts of a liquid are greater and contain a larger proportion of the subtle elements than solids ; while gases have their particles so separated that they approach fire in their freedom of motion . As he quaintly puts it : a body is a fluid when it is divided in many little parts which are free to move separately in various ways , and it is hard when all its parts are so interlaced that there is no action capable of separating them . Cohesion in hard bodies is caused by the lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he harder than rest , which is the quality the most contrary to motion . He does not tell us how to interlace and twist a number of spheres and irregular fragments together , so as to form compact and inextricable units of matter . ' To anyone but a great philosopher they would remain ropes of sand . Descartes had spent much time investigating the experimental laws and phenomena of light and with notable success . One of his greatest ambitions was evidently to explain the nature of light and the mode of its transmission , for he discusses these in great detail in his Principia and refers to his solution of the problem constantly in his letters with much complacency . As noted , the substance of the sun and stars is like fire in respect to its motions ; for there is nothing I // more agitated than fire which can disintegrate even solid matter into its smallest parts , and then carry them away . So we should believe that the matter of the sun is celestial fire , very fluid and agitated , carrying off with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first kind is constantly rushing along the axis toward the center of the vortex , yet , when it approaches that point , it experiences a tendency to fly out to the equatorial surface because of its centrifugal force . The effort , not only of the little spheres of the second kind but also of the fragmentary particles of the first kind , to leave the center of a stellar vortex , constitutes light . While all particles of a vortex may tend to move away from the center because of their centrifugal force , yet , since they are packed like balls in a cup , they can not really move and so only tend to move . Just as when a sufficient hole is made in the bottom of a cup filled with balls , one of them drops through and all the balls lying within an inverted cone settle down ; so it is with light , if any particle in space tends to move , this tendency or pressure is instantly transmitted to any distance along straight lines , which come not only from the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its superficies . If we attempted to discuss details , we should find ourselves worried and baffled between this tendency to move in a plenum and the real motions of balls in a cup containing free spaces between them . But there is little use in fretting // over such a detail , when the entire conception is not light nor anything resembling light . Descartes may , perhaps , prove that this tendency to move proceeds in straight lines and would be reflected and refracted in agreement with the laws of light ; that the interstellar spaces would be transparent ; that terrestrial bodies would vary from transparency to opacity according to the greater proportion and complexity of matter of the third kind in their composition ; but the mechanism of all this is far more obscure and complicated than the phenomena it attempts to elucidate . This theory of light advanced in the Principia was , in a sense , supported by the rather meager experimental knowledge then existing , and seems at first plausible . But examined critically , and with the mind no longer awed , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his power of making words seem to express clear ideas when they really do not , his cause of light is found to be as arbitrary as the fiat lux of a God , and its effects mere confusion . In fact , it is the unavoidable weakness of any such hypothesis , and a very irritating and tantalizing weakness , that the words used apparently express things we can understand , and yet when we try to visualize these things , stripped of technical and intricate verbiage , the mind has received no clear impression . And here we have a splendid example of an hypothesis , whose foundations now seem ridiculous ; whose // laws are not correct generalizations ; and whose conclusions are unlike the phenomena of nature ; which , nevertheless , anticipates an idea to be advanced again , after a century and a half . This hypothesis of light contains , as a corollary , the germ of the kinetic theory of heat . He discards the notion , which then generally prevailed , that heat was a sort of mysterious substance called caloric , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and defines it as the oscillatory agitation of terrestrial particles , set up by the pressure of light . The pores of such bodies are tortuous , and the pressure of light on one end of such a gross and irregularly shaped particle may be greater than on the other end and so cause a tipping motion . Such a tilt would give an oscillatory motion to a particle , similar to a violin string when bowed , and he believed its momentum affects us as heat . An oscillation of this sort would communicate itself to neighboring particles and therefore explains the conduction of heat from one part of a body to another ; also , it accounts for the expansion of bodies by heat , since vibrating particles usually require more space than quiescent ones ; but , on the other hand , they might be so shaped and arranged as to occupy less space , when in motion , and such a body should contract if heated . Such an effect was unknown at that time , but we ought to claim that it was brilliantly verified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract when heated from zero to four // degrees Centigrade . Not to contradict known phenomena , and to anticipate some unknown ones , is held to be the justification of such hypotheses ; by this standard Descartes was successful as few others have been . Yet , if we compare the splendid advances which he made in science by his experimental discoveries and his application of mathematics to physical laws , to the mass of falsehood in his metaphysical schemes by which he dominated science and which still flourish in the metaphysical theories now in vogue , we can hardly tell whether he has benefited or done harm to science by his labors . Possibly no labor is too great , if by it we arrive at ever so little truth , but no one can believe that this medieval conception of light and heat induced his successors to seek for a possible , but unexpected , contraction of water . Surely the converse is the case and his metaphysical divination was purely specious ; the phenomena were discovered without any reference to his theory and probably without even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we may use them as a buttress for Descartes 's tottering edifice . The fourth and last book of the Principia is devoted to an explanation of the natural phenomena of the earth . At first the earth was a small stellar vortex , composed of matter of the first kind only , and was one of fourteen satellary nuclei located in our larger solar vortex . Gradually the less subtile parts of its mass attached themselves together and formed spots or // crusts on its surface , similar to sun-spots , a phenomenon then recently made known by the telescope . Sun-spots , because of the superior agitation of solar matter , are broken up and disappear , but the earthspots formed more rapidly than they dissipated , finally covering its surface with a thick crust of many layers , composed of what he called matter of the third kind . This crust diminished the motion of the terrestrial vortex and finally destroyed it altogether , so that the earth with its atmosphere and its obscure bodies descended toward the sun to the place it now occupies . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of diversity in its composition , Descartes was free to employ the remainder of his treatise to the description of the character of each aggregation of elementary matter necessary to form the various chemical substances ; the proportions and velocities of the three kinds of matter to produce forces , such as cohesion , weight , etc. , and the different geo-physical phenomena , such as winds , rain , and earthquakes . It is amazing how much he passes before our eyes , and how ingeniously he links his ideas , giving to them the appearance of the greatest plausibility . There is little profit in discussing these at length , for if the conclusions of the hypothesis were absurd when applied to those regions of space about which we even yet know little , they become grotesque when connected with matter which we can investigate experi98 THE LIMITATIONS OF SCIENCE mentally . Besides our thesis is with such methods in general , and in this respect only is a study of Descartes 's system useful , as it is his method which still flourishes in the theories of physics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this respect ; when he had once outlined his premises and his method , he deduced his conclusions as rigorously as possible , and compared them consistently with experience ; whereas it has become the custom now to alter postulates whenever their conclusions point to error , with the result that it is most difficult to outline a consistent and invidual modern theory . If we study modern scientific theories we find that the postulates are as metaphysical , if not more so , than those of Descartes . They are stated with much assurance , but as the conclusions unfold themselves , we begin to notice a certain hesitation and a desire to limit the discussion to a small and related class of phenomena . Or if an excursion is made into a wider field , lack of confidence increases and usually results in a modification and confusion of the postulates . If Descartes 's theory may he illustrated as a tree with all its conclusions branching out from a single idea as a stem , our present state of physics is like a thicket of bushes with many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any branch can not be distinguished . I have sketched the most elaborate and comprehensive hypothesis ever developed in the name of science , // which , if it means anything to mankind , is his best expression of verity and fact . Yet we see Descartes , an illustrious man of science , devoting his talents to the exposition of an openly confessed fiction . And his reputation rests on the belief that he has spun a web of fancy so subtly that it could deceive us . While additional knowledge has been acquired by us , no one has shown that modern theorists have discovered a method different and more trustworthy than that of Descartes . We recognize that many of the laws he formulated are false and that most of his facts have been corrected or disproved , but we should remember that modern hypotheses also are developed as a means of attacking unexplored regions of science where our own knowledge is either meager or false . For example , he felt it necessary to find a cause for the recently discovered sun-spots and then extended its action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet . A better knowledge of these spots on the sun proves that his whole reasoning was false , or shall I say childish . But was it less plausible at that time or even less childish than is now our most recent theory ; that an atom of matter is a system of corpuscles , each of which is a unit of free negative electricity moving with the velocity of light , and that this denatured bit of electricity is nothing but a localized strain in an ethereal plenum . Let " us examine ; such a postulate as we would a similar statement if it had been zoo THE LIMITATIONS OF SCIENCE made by Descartes . We may admit with Lord Kelvin that we know nothing about the real nature of electricity . We do know experimentally that electricity seems to be associated always with matter ; the greatest velocity we have caused or observed any body of an appreciable size to have , is one thousand eight hundred times less than the speed of light . An ethereal plenum is certainly only a matter of imagination , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenum is hardly a clear idea . So it seems that the facts supporting our modern postulates regarding the nature of substance are as meager and doubtful , and our ideas as obscure for our purpose , as those of Descartes were for his . On the contrary , it is no exaggeration to say that there probably never lived a man better equipped than Descartes to make and to defend an hypothesis ; his scientific skepticism , his freedom from the trammels of authority , his devotion and skill in experimental work , his determination to submit his ideas to the rigorous logic of mathematical analysis in which he was the leader of his age , were admirable qualities for such a purpose . A man who doubts even his own existence , is not likely to adopt other ideas lightly . To strip matter of every quality except mere extension ; to abolish every cause of phenomena except linear motion and . the impact of bodies , both of which are capable of the most accurate experimental investigaINFLUENCE ON RECENT SCIENCE ioi tion ; is to attempt the limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a postulate as the criterion of matter , is directly traceable to his fundamental dictum : cogito , ergo sum . If his own existence is real only because of thought , and if mind or thought be the criterion of all reality , form replaces substance , and the extent of matter is its essential quality . Although Descartes went further in this di-rection than most men of science are willing to go , yet he has imposed his method on science to the present day and we are still industriously building worlds as we think them to be . Dazzling as the system of Descartes appears when viewed as a whole , it has a foundation of sand and an imaginary rather than a substantial superstructure . Consider his statements : space or matter is infinite in extent and continuous in character , and in the begin-ning it was divided in equal parts which were then moved with a force sufficient to separate them . If matter fills all space , or rather is space , where was the additional space to permit of this separation and what then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impact and grinding of particle on par-ticle are supposed to have reduced them to uniform spheres and the dust of this attrition then served to fill the spaces left in such a pile of spheres . This dust is of all shapes and so fine that there is always at hand just the proper quantity to fill any space be102 THE LIMITATIONS OF SCIENCE tween the spheres . It really amounts to endowing these cosmic fragments with the intelligence of Leibnitzian monads ; if impact and grinding produced them , why are they also not true spheres ? The sand on the seashore is as spherical as the pebbles . Then too , if the original parts of space were reduced in size by attrition , why did they attain a certain size and then cease to be worn away ? Or are we to suppose that the whole universe ? earth , stars , and interstellar spaces ? are still grinding themselves away until some day all its parts will be reduced to the size of the cosmic dust which he calls fire ? We might go still further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and simply vanish . But even if we showed , step by step , that the scheme not only was not true , but even not capable of resisting the most cursory criticism , we should be met by the answer ; that as knowledge increases , details which are erroneous will be abandoned and new ones substituted which better approximate to the truth . This countercriticism seems aside from the question ; it would be strange if the efforts made to discover new phenomena and laws , and to correct false ones , did not increase our knowledge . But is this aim furthered by such hypothetical systems , which attempt to describe the mechanism of these phenomena and laws , and which , at bottom , assume that their authors are the creators of the universe and not observers of one whose laws and // phenomena are independent of them ; a confusion of subjective ideality and objective reality ? Also however it advances , our knowledge of nature will always be so inadequate that the very announcement of a system of nature should cause us to suspect it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useless as an aid to scientific investigation . Nor can we find a system which does not transgress constantly the limitations of science , and it is safe to say none will ever be proposed which will not transgress them , because it is the desire for such a system that is false , and not its development . On the other hand , the discovery and verification of phenomena should be unreservedly advocated , also their classification into laws and even the restricted use of hypothesis . But the latter has come to have two meanings in scientific usage . The word hypothesis very frequently signifies a law which has been pretty accurately expressed and verified by available experience , but which still does not embrace some phenomena believed to be related to it , or is contradicted by some others ; for example , the law of conservation of energy was an hypothesis in this sense , until the discovery of the mechanical equivalent of heat proved that the mechanical energy , apparently lost in every action by friction , was accurately balanced by the thermal energy produced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact a law or hypothesis of I04 THE LIMITATIONS OF SCIENCE this sort should always be announced as soon as a considerable number of facts point to its probable truth ; such tentative laws always direct attention to the phenomena involved and stimulate research . But hypothesis in the other sense does not gradually crystallize into law as our knowledge increases . No information , however greater than ours at present , will ever advance Descartes 's hypothesis a step closer to a law . We shall never have any data about his three kinds of matter , his nature of free space , etc. ; we learn constantly more about the action of light but we still drift confusedly and without a guide between his apparatus of pressures , Newton 's corpuscles , and Huygens 's waves ; the latest treatise on optics now states that we may have to mix together all three of them . The system of Descartes will fascinate anyone who surrenders himself to its spirit and scope , but illusion is not the function of science . Nor can I find any more accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that given by Bolingbroke : " The notion Descartes entertained and propagated , that there is , besides clear ideas , a kind of inward sentiment of evidence , which may be a principle of knowledge , is , I suppose , dangerous in physical inquiries as well as in abstract reasoning . He who departs from the analytic method , to establish general propositions concerning the phenomena on assumptions , and who reaINFLUENCE // sons from these assumptions , afterwards on inward sentiments of knowledge , as they are called , instead of clear and real ideas , lays aside , at once , the only sure guides to knowledge . This Descartes did very widely in his construction of a world , and yet by dint of genius he gave a great air of simplicity and plausibility to his hypothesis , and he knew how to make even geometry subservient to error . . . . The plenum of Descartes is well-nigh destroyed ; many of his laws of motion are shown to be false ; the mills that served to grind his three elements are demolished : and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the planets were carried around the sun , whilst a similar motion in the particular vortex of every planet impelled all bodies to the center , is vanished . Notwithstanding all this , how slowly , how unwillingly have many philosophers departed from the Cartesian hypothesis ? " That Bolingbroke was mistaken when he says that the plenum , the vortices , and all the other apparatus of Descartes have been destroyed , can be readily seen by reading-any modern treatise on physics . But he was vividly correct in the larger and more important part , when he finds that all such hypotheses are based on an inward sentiment of truth and not on clear and real ideas . An inward sentiment of knowledge is and must be the final guide of anyone who employs this hypothetical method , for how can anyone have clear aril real ideas about such things as tranio6 THE LIMITATIONS OF SCIENCE scend experience ? And amongst the many following this method , what man can be the arbiter to declare which one has been gifted by a divine power with the true inward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth of science has ever had not merely the task of evolving herself from the dull and uniform mist of ignorance , but also that of repressing and dissolving the phantoms of the imagination. ? FARADAY . IF we are compelled to revert to old and supposedly discarded systems of thought when we attempt to make new hypothetical systems , we should inquire whether we are really advancing the theory of science by that method . Is it true that Descartes reaches in his wonderful clarity of expression the highest attainment in speculative thought ? Even in the then little cultivated subjects of electricity and magnetism , his imagination did not fail him and he drew a picture of the field of force about a magnet which is strikingly like those in modern treatises . And to explain electrical attraction , he supposed bodies to contain little filaments of his elementary matter which were crowded out when the bodies were rubbed together . These filaments attached themselves like lines of force to neighboring bodies . When the rubbing was stopped they retracted and so drew the electrified bodies together . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ io8 THE LIMITATIONS OF SCIENCE ment of Faraday 's lines of force . Faraday believed that when a body is electrified the space about it is filled with lines of electric force which are stretched in the direction of their length and experience a pressure at right angles to their direction . This idea , or rather the modification of it by Maxwell , who was able to assign quantitative values to those forces which correspond with the laws of electrical attraction and repulsion , is expressed more precisely . But qualitatively : that is , in telling us what electricity is ; why it is produced by friction ; and what lines of force are ; the modern statement is no more definite than that of Descartes . It is a mistake , however , to suppose he possessed a unique power of formulating hypothesis ; other early writers attained eminence in this respect . Thus Sir Thomas Browne thought that electric effluvia ( the prevailing name for force ) behave like threads of syrup which elongate and contract and so produce attraction ; Von Guericke stated that bodies contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form an electric field of force . In agreement with these opinions , we are taught to-day that the best way to consider lines of force is to picture an electrified body as one surrounded by stretched elastic bands . As a diagram to show the direction of motion of an attracted body , and as a name for the quantity of force , this conception of elastic lines of force is accurate and convenient . But Faraday and Maxwell went far beTHE // yond this , as they gave to them a concrete reality . This conception still persists , although Sir J. J. Thomson showed years ago that no known system of mechanical forces would keep such a system of force-lines in equilibrium and Professor Lorentz now says they can not really exist but are fictions of the imagination . It seems rather futile , if such be the normal history of hypothetical models , to inflict on us the labor of learning abstruse hypotheses which continually revamp old metaphysical terms and merely dress them up in new transcendental symbols . It is a valuable exercise to strip hypotheses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceive our minds into believing that a clear idea has been conveyed , when , in fact , they have merely been wrenched from any real significance . Thus Sir Oliver Lodge says that the ether is very massive . This definition at once increases our belief in its reality since it conveys the impression that the ether is tangible and impenetrable , something like a vast globe of rock . And we must stop to think before we realize that whatever the ether may be , it must be just the opposite to our ordinary ideas of massive things . Or what clear idea is conveyed by Professor Einstein 's definition that vacuous space contains radiant energy which is an entity of the same kind as matter ? Does he not add to the difficulty when he says further , that the difference between a vacuum and the ether is that the latter is a vacuum transmitting radiant no THE LIMITATIONS OF SCIENCE energy and possesses a light vector . What right has he to insinuate into our minds that a vacuum may contain something and still be a vacuum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " energy , " which he permits us to think of in the ordinary sense as an attribute of matter and at the same time states implicitly to be a distinct entity . We are inclined to pass lightly over the second statement because we tacitly think of a light vector as a geometrical line ; the substance of such a line is too intangible to give a distinct shock to the reason . But if we put this definition to a simple test , we easily see how futile it is . Say to anyone , that a golf ball in its flight is not a thing of rubber and paint but a complex of energy ; and , that this is true because the moving golf ball has a motion vector and consequently changes vacuous space into ether . How quickly such a statement about a familiar action would be recognized as an absurdity . I presume that the reason why we like to indulge in these phantoms of the imagination is because we still hate to confess our ignorance . But it is a pity that science thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypothesis as it progresses into transcendental symbolism . Sir Joseph Larmor and Professor Lorentz wish to define electricity so that it may be measured . They adopt the hypothetical method to a limited degree . Thus , they each postulate the atom of matter . They next assume each atom to consist of a multitude of positively and THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD I l l negatively electrified particles which revolve in orbits . Except to say that these particles may be a modification of an ether , they avoid explicit details . Their method of exposition is still the classic method of mechanics . When they try to explain certain lately discovered and obscure phenomena , they merely show that they could be satisfied by supposing the dimensions of bodies to be influenced by their motion . At this point they wisely refrain from further explanations . Next we find that Professor Einstein definitely changes electrical particles into particles of electricity and matter into complexes of energy . He speaks so confidently of his ability to visualize electricity and energy that we feel our own inability to do so results from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole matter and explains the changes of the dimensions of moving bodies by introducing the occult idea that light is an entity which moves in space with a constant velocity . It is a far cry from the inductive method of science which attempts to build generalizations on experience , thus to make the whole concrete world conform to so abstract an idea as the constancy of the velocity of light in space . Nor does he hesitate to found physical science on the paradox , that motion can not be absolute but the motion of light is absolute . Then Professor Minkowski goes a step further . He accepts all these ideas and then treats them symbolically . To deduce conclusions from these postulates , // he uses mathematical equations as if there were four dimensions to space . The mathematician can employ equations which contain four or any number of variables , but the physicist who desires to deal with an objectively real universe and also to be intelligible is forced to limit himself to the three dimensions which correspond to his powers of measurement of length , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific method utterly by arbitrarily assuming which quantities in an equation shall be treated as variable and which as constant . Thus he says , if the momentum of a body changes , let us suppose that this happens not because its motion changes but because we shall consider its mass variable . Of course anyone can say , let us consider the universe to act as he wishes . But , after all , what is the use when no one believes it does ? Is it any wonder that a gulf is growing not only between men of science and the rest of the world , but also between theorists and those who are still willing to submit their imagination to experience ? Such a gulf is certain to continue so long as theorists are willing , and even anxious , to ignore common sense and the facts gained by patient and exact experimentation . It is true that my criticism of scientific method has been so far purely destructive . And in that admission may lie the ineffectiveness of the argument to many . Some will say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been , yet it is the custom of thought and in spite of it or even , in some way , because of it , scientific truth has nobly expanded , dispelling ignorance and subjugating natural forces . But because knowledge advances , objection should not be made to a protest against what tends to embarrass a more rapid advance . Such a protest is the value of destructive criticism . The reason why scientific knowledge advances in spite of hypotheses , those phantoms of the imagination , is because hypothesis rarely precedes experiment . If we examine the work of the experimenter of to-day , we find he still goes on calmly working with apparatus and using it with the common sense idea that he is using real objective matter in spite of the attempt of the theorist to make it an attribute of energy or electricity . The conclusions derived from experiment and laws may be discussed and condemned or approved according as they support a fashionable hypothesis , but scientific hypothesis is much like religious dogma : although it may protest , yet in the end it swerves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short time the despised fact is cited as a pillar , or at least as a flying buttress of the hypothesis . While it is not possible to draw a definite boundary line between the regions of physics and metaphysics , still we may do so in a general way by saying that the domain of physics is concerned with the discovery of phenomena and the formulation of natural laws based // on postulates which are determined by experience and generally accepted as true ; the causes of phenomena and the discussion of the postulates of science lie in the province of the metaphysician . This differentiation in method of thought can not be rigidly adhered to since the boundary line is more or less obscure , and is liable to considerable displacernent as a science advances ; but the acceptance of this principle would prevent much of the confusion which has been introduced into science by writers who have not recognized it to be a general rule . For example , the principle of relativity is not strictly a physical law but the expression , in mathematical symbols , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human mind which has been accepted for centuries . Again , the discussion of the shape of the atom or electron is not a physical problem , as it is incapable of verification by experience . This does not mean that such questions should not be discussed , but the method of their discussion and the results obtained are properly the method and results of metaphysics and are not in the category of physical phenomena and laws . In the first place , men of science must accept the existence of an objective universe , whose phenomena and laws are external to our intelligence and will . But , since the interpretation of phenomena is subjective and thus conditioned by our intelligence and will , scientific laws are governed by the mathematical // theory of probability , or the consensus of opinion of the greatest number , working with the greatest care . The basic laws of physics are the laws of continuity and conservation , and the law of cause and effect . Unless we believe that something , matter , energy , or both , remains unchanged in amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unless phenomena can be repeated , we have no certainty of knowledge and no means of communicating ideas to others . The discussion of the reality of these laws may be left to the philosopher , but I dare say , however he decides , they will continue to be accepted by mankind generally . The universality and application of these and other laws should be rigidly ' limited to experience by the physicist . The law of conservation requires that the quantity of matter and energy is either infinite , which means nothing , or that there is an exact interchange in quantity in every action . This belief is expressed in Newton 's law that to every action there is an equal and contrary reaction . But it is evident that conservation , as , a scientific law which may be verified , is limited to a very small category of observations and is only approximate for them . Thus we know nothing of the total amount of energy radiated from the sun or where it goes . Hypothesis here shows considerable vacillation . Some assert that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundary ; others say i16 THE LIMITATIONS OF SCIENCE that the universe is so filled with matter that no straight line can be drawn from the sun without reaching an obstacle and so radiant energy is reflected back and forth ; again the universe may be finite in size and its boundary may be a reflecting surface . These hypotheses are evidently futile speculations and no support to the law which we have been driven to accept and shall continue to accept until personal observation shows results which increasingly depart from the law . So , too , the law of cause and effect is a generalization from few observations and neither supports nor is supported by hypothesis . While we can never hope to establish such a law , it is nevertheless a necessary generalization , or scientific deduction becomes meaningless . The fact is , the phenomena of the universe do not reveal themselves , as a whole , in any regular sequence of cause and effect ; and our theories , based on such a law , show such a complex tangle as to be quite beyond our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past time at that ; and the successive causes of an observed phenomenon , if carried back in any logical sequence , soon widen out into an incomprehensible maze and vanish in the obscurity of the past . The most beautiful and perfect example of this law is the belief in organic evolution . Yet on what meager and inaccurate observations it rests . Everyone believes in some such law , but no one can point out the sequence of cause and effect , and its rigorous development leads // to absurdity . Mathematically it is a law of geometrically decreasing types which reduce finally to a single protoplasm . If we adopt the hypothetical method , we should discuss the origin of this protoplasm . To say it was made by God , is not scientific . Lord Kelvin offers an hypothesis ( although one would suppose he was joking if the context were not so serious ) when he suggests that the original protoplasm may have fallen on the earth from some celestial body ! However we are to consider such an extraordinary statement , we do know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the futile method of estimating the ' number of molecules in a germ . The question with him was whether there were enough molecules to form miniature organs and parts of the mature object into which the germ would expand . Another illustration may be given to show that as soon as we extend our laws beyond the point where verification is possible , we merely cause confusion . Certain experiments indicate that the apparent mass of a body changes when it moves in an electric field . The law shows that the mass should become infinite when the velocity equals that of light . This conclusion has been accepted as the basis of an hypothesis that the velocity of light is a maximum limit to motion . Such a belief is not only pure hypothesis but it is contrary to the conclusions of other hypotheses . If this hypo1i8 THE LIMITATIONS OF SCIENCE thetical method is generally applicable it is necessary to explain gravitational action also as due to some form of motion ; Laplace has shown that the motion involved requires a velocity many times that of light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from our sense perception of force . The muscular sense of effort is apparently the simplest and most general mechanical notion we have , and in the opinion of the masters of the science our idea of force is adequate to serve as the basis of so exact a science as physics . Yet , when we attempt to make force serve as a fundamental measure of phenomena , we have found , since the time of Newton , that it is not so convenient as mass and acceleration . Motion is further divisible into a measurement of length and time . It is therefore customary to reduce all our complex observations into combinations of the fundamental units of mass , length , and time instead of force . The idea of force being thus associated in our minds as an attribute of matter , we postulate the objective reality and conservation of matter and assume the fundamental attribute of matter to be its mass or inertia . M. Hannequin expresses this idea clearly when he says that nothing in a mechanical sense exists except masses in motion . We shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fundamental units of measure . These quantities are continuous or , at least , are indefinitely divisible . i // The continuity of space and time is generally accepted ; without this belief it is impossible to establish the geometrical laws of figure founded on the point , line , and surface or the analytical laws of motion derived from the calculus . The only exception I know to this postulate is Professor Planck 's theory of quanta , in which motion may occur in jumps . But the divisibility of matter is not usually supposed to be infinite . Indeed , the denial of this assertion is the foundation of all atomic theories . Yet it is difficult to see how mathematics can be anything but abstract logic , or how it can be applied to physical , problems unless this third fundamental quantity , which is , as it were , the connecting link between the abstract and the concrete , be also indefinitely divisible .. It is only by the postulate of the indefinite divisibility of mass that we may pass from the mathematical laws of pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion of bodies ( dynamics ) . How , otherwise , can we replace finite bodies by mathematical centers of inertia ? In this connection Sir Joseph Larmor says : " The difficulty of imagining a definite uniform limit of divisibility of matter will always be a philosophical obstacle to an atomic theory , so long as atoms are regarded as discrete particles moving in empty space . But as soon as we take the next step in physical development , that of ceasing to regard space as mere empty geometrical continuity , the atomic constitution of matter ( each
