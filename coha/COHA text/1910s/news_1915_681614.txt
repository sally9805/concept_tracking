txt Appreciative of Mr. Churchill . I beg to take exception to your editorial article on Mr. Churchill and the schools . Mr. Thomas W. Churchill found a. great machine whose grinding process had deadened , disheartened , and discouraged the teacher ? the steam , the motive power . He brought a human quality into a machine , a ? democracy Into it bureaucracy dominated by an autocracy . No stream can rise higher than its source , and lessons , plans , statistics , reports . supervision , courses of study , and Chinese examinations never yet revealed a teacher . There is the steam , there is the power to make men and women worthy of the State in the teacher . " Where there is no vision , the people perish . " Mr. Churchill has a singular insight into the need* of the great mass of the common people , of common school teachers , and a great deal of common sense in applying this power where he can get results . He is not a bureaucrat , an aristocrat or an autocrat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word .
