PLACE : " New Place , " Stratford-on-Avon . TIME : April 23 , 1616 . SCENE : A living room . The walls are of oak beams with plaster between ; the ceiling is beamed . At one side of the room is a fireplace . Beyond this is a door leading to the hall , into which opens the front door of the house . At the back of the room is a large door opening into an inner room ; opposite the fireplace is a door leading to other parts of the house ; above this is a large leaded window . Near the fireplace is a oaken chest ; at the back of the room is a cupboard ; in front of the window are a writing desk and chair . Near the center of the room are a table and three chairs . On the table are three pewter mugs , pewter dishes , and an oaken flagon ; on the desk are a trinket box , an ink pot in which stands a crimson quill pen , and a book . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of neatness about the room which suggests that the owner might have recently put it in order before going on a journey . When the curtain rises the dimly lighted stage is empty . A fire burns in the fireplace ; a ray of sunlight steals through the drawn curtains and falls across the floor . In the distance a clock chimes the hour , then strikes seven . The Nurse enters from the hall carrying some branches of apple blossoms in her arms . She is a large , motherly person of at least seventy . She goes to the door at the back of the room and opens it . In the inner room is seen a bed on which lies the body of a man ; two lighted candles stand at the foot of the bed . The Nurse lays the apple blossoms on the bed , looks about the room , and moves the candles a little nearer the bed . Jenkyns , the local schoolmaster , enters from the hall . He is a man of seventy . JENKYNS in a hushed toneNurse ! p. 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JENKYNS Has anyone been here since I left ? NURSE No . JENKYNS His daughters should have come by now .

I could not wish her worse ! JUDITH Mother , do not forget ; he was our father . ANNE Yes , so was he when he kept the house awake nights with his seribblings ; so was he when he wrote foul verses to hang on the gates of honest gentry and disgraced our name ; so was he when he ran away to London and left you without a thought ! Did your father think of you when you were starving and I had to borrow forty shillings of my father 's shepherd to buy you food !

JUDITH The night he wed my mother . MISTRESS WHATELEY I did not mean to bring that to your mind . JUDITH ' T is not a pleasant story ; MISTRESS WHATELEY coming to JudithLet me look at you .

I am a jilted wife  --  the scorn of womankind ! I warrant it was a bed he never slept in ! And were he still alive he 'd never sleep again in peace . I 'd see to that . Nor shall he rest in peace within the grave ! My curse shall rest upon him ! I 'll recall his past and make his name again a by-word here in Stratford !

There is something in her simple dignity that quiets Anne . Anne , I said naught to you when you took him from me . For thirty-five years I 've held my peace , but now I do not go until I 've had my say ! ANNE You think to shame me  --  to turn my daughters ' love to hate ? Well , we 'll see . I can give as good as you . MISTRESS WHATELEY I know your waspish tongue of old . ' T will do no good to use it now . ANNE changing her tackYou come to taunt me when my heart is broke .

With honied words made me forget my maiden modesty ; and when he 'd wrought the wrong , ' t was right that he should save me from disgrace . p. 23 MISTRESS WHATELEY Made you , Anne ! Do not lie unto yourself . Made you ! He a lad of seventeen and you a grown woman ! ANNE flaring upA grown woman ! She taunts me with my age ! MISTRESS WHATELEY You tricked him into marrying you , knowing that he did not love you . You made no home for him that loved the little niceties of life , but made him live in squalor . You drove him from you by your nagging tongue to taverns and low company . Your jealous tantrums made banishment a happy liberty ! ANNE I did not drive him hence . He always wished for London and its easy , sinful ways , the lazy lout ! MISTRESS WHATELEY Easy ! There alone , without friends , without money , he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to hand . If that was the theater I can not hold him wrong . It was the only means he had to live . You were his wife . You could have helped him much . Your love should have been the inspiration of his life and spurred him on to honorable fame . Instead , you drove him to his worst and wrecked the promise of his youth . What he was you made him . What sins are his , they are upon your head . Her strength is spent . Master Jenkyns , take me home . She takes Jenkyns ' arm weakly . Exeunt Mistress Whateley and Jenkyns. p. 24 ANNE turning on Susanna and Judith in her rageNice daughters , you , to leave me to her wrath . I who never did a person harm ! And this is my reward .

JUDITH Would he listen ? SUSANNA fatuouslyJohn 's position , as leading physician of Stratford , would have much weight , I 'm sure . p. 25 DR . HALL smuglyI think it did , my dear . To the othersThe Vicar was most kind and will help us in every way he can to quiet talk of the circumstances of your father 's marriage , his banishment from here , and his life in London . As tithe owner he is privileged to be buried within the church ; to this the Vicar will make no objection . And his advice is to destroy all evidence of your father 's connection with the theater . SUSANNA That is wisely said . DR . HALL Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects ? SUSANNA He had put everything to rights . DR . HALL That is well ; ' t will save much trouble . SUSANNA His will and an unfinished play is all we found . DR . HALL He , too , must have wished the past forgot . ANNE And so he might . DR . HALL Let me have the will . ANNE Yes , look at it and see the shame he 's put upon me ! JUDITH getting the will and the play from the deskHere it is , and the unfinished play . p. 26 DR . HALL taking the willI 'll keep the will . Put the play by . Judith lays the play on the table . The Vicar will be here presently to read a prayer . ANNE And why should he do that ? DR .

Aye , tell me that ? Shall I be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a model man  --  a true , kind , loving and long-suffering husband ! Is that your plan ? Well , that you 'll not .

What differences You had you should have hid within the family walls and shown an outward sign of amity and love , not aired your grievance to a tattling world and lain your children open to much shame . ANNE What shame there was , is his . You all know that . SUSANNA Our family scandal is an old wives ' tale retold by gossips round the winter fire . p. 27 ANNE proudlyAye , that it is . DR .

The others gather around as Dr. Hall takes manuscript after manuscript from the chest and tosses them on the floor . SUSANNA looking at one of the manuscriptsWhy , it 's a play ! Looking at anotherAnd so is this . Looking at severalThey must be father 's plays . Reading from a manuscript " Twelfth Night or What You Will .

Although an actor , without the law , without the Church , the burial will be with the full service for the dead , as with peace-departed souls .

And you must bend your thoughts to build a pretty legend round his life , of honor , truth , and simple loyalty . p. 30 ANNE Ah-h-h . The others quiet her with their looks .
