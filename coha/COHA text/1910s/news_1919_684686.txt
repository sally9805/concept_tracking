txt A champion of social purity was lately demanding that these United States unite still further to establish a uniform divorce law . " It would be quite as feasible , and more to the purpose , " said a critical bystander , " if they would establish a uniformfor those already divorced . " There was something besides a quip in the remark . It is not abroad among our many States that social standards are diversified ; within each community there is a chaos inconceivable a few decades ago . Standards are so various that in effect there are no standards . Only the facts are definite , and even in matters of fact the dead past buries its dead with a celerity that is uncanny . A uniform would at least keep the record alive , give the social conscience material ' upon which to work . For women , Summer white or Winter dark might have always an edging of violet . Men might wear amethyst studs and waistcoats braided to match . Somewhat lets colored with fancy is the plan urged by Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Cincinnati . As it was delivered before the American Bar Association and approved by Euuu ROOT , we may be permitted to take it seriously . Justice HOFFMAN proposes to establish family courts , in which " social evidence , as distinguished from legal , " will , have weight . " The family court should be an " extension of the principle upon which " the juvenile court is founded , " Justice HorFmAx declares roundly that " no sci " entific law has ever been made on the " subject of divorce . " What he'means by " scientific " is explained in another sentence : " Divorces are granted for certain " causes , but no-effort is made to classify " those causes . " Senator ROOT , having declared on the previous day for " a government of law , not of men , " illustrated the flexibility of the language= and of the legal mind by declaring that he would put an end to " the business of " attempting to bring about justice by " statute , " and " would leave it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law that is necessary is " a few meagre rules embodying the fundamental principles . " Such interference of personal authority in the affairs of the individual runs qwq yet there can be.no doubt that it is gaining ground among us , and rapidly . To the example of the juvenile courts Justiee HOFFMAN might'ave added that of the probation officers , for mature offenders ; In New York State , -. in cases in whic . persons legally convicted have " been subjected to personal influence instead of being sent ' to jail , seven out . of ten have " made goOd . " At present there are 428 more persons on probation than in/confinement . The difference to the offender is often the difference . between . a ! life wrecked and a life saved . In the case of the criminal , the failure of our ancient legal processes has long been notorious . But is the best of all our divorce laws any better ? Is it not  --  possible that . the personal influence of a Judge may be more beneficent than the most drastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moral spirit of the community could be relied on to correct its own evils . If so , that time has.long been dead . Even the picturesque device of a uniform might not revive it . What resource . is left except official and personal influence ? Senator ROOT 'S " few meagre rules " would cover the more flagrant offenses . Beyond these there need be no statutory law . The origin of the modern evil of divorce is too deep to be touched by any body of legislation , however uniform , however scientific . It is largely economic . Throughout the middle class , where divorce is most rampant , the purchasing power of salaries has sunk so low that few can afford children . The childless , homeless wife falls prey to a thousand extravagances , both in conduct and in opinion . Neither is the plight of the homeless , hard-working husband altogether enviable . A relation ? which is fundamentally the deepest and most enduring breaks up in a thousand surface bickerings . In a crisis , the old affection sometimes revives , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its manifest insincerities , its blatant publicity , its undignified wranglings , is least of all likely to bring a resurgence of the primal impulse . In the privacy of a domestic court , under the calm counsel of an experienced Judge who was obviously disinterested , there would be at least a chance that bickering would cease and elemental nature regain its sway .
