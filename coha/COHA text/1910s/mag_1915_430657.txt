 | THE Republic has not been a failure . It is absolutely certain to continue . Monarchial government is as dead in China as it is in the United States , where , excepting in a very limited sense , it never existed . I am president of China ; and that means president of a Republic . I have no desire to be anything else ; and I wish to continue as head of the Chinese nation only according to the wishes of those who are qualified and competent to say who shall be the official leader of the Chinese people . I am asked to speak to the American people , and indeed for a number of reasons I am most happy to do so . First , the American people have always seemed to me to be unselfish in their interest in Chinese political affairs . They have never wanted to control our Government nor to direct our policies , tho the United States Government has often advised us as to the best course to pursue in international matters . Secondly , the American people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been termed our experiment in democracy than are other peoples ; and , thirdly , the American nation , alone among the great powers , has the time and inclination to listen to a recital of China 's position at this time . I gladly speak to the Government and people of the United States . MISLEADING NEWS FROM CHINA I am misrepresented even in the American and British press . Excerpts from the newspapers and magazines are sent me by our legations in Washington and London ; and they show that there is either a wilful plan to destroy foreign confidence in Chinese democracy or that there are Chinese enemies of mine who wish to see me thrust out of the way even if they must go to the extent of re-establishing the crown . Your journals can not too strongly impress upon the officials and people of the United . States that the assertions to the effect that I am in favor of the reestablishment of the monarchy and that I desire to be Emperor are made by my enemies , not by my friends . Had I continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our country I would have thrown all my weight on the side of the dynasty . But I saw that a change was inevitable ; that China as a monarchy was weak against internal disturbers no less than against foreign aggressors ; that kingly institutions were not in keeping with progress and enlightenment . I sought , personally , the prominent members of the royal house and urged that the will of the intelligent and modernistic portions of the people demanded that a change be brought about . I arrayed myself with the forces of democracy , and democracy won . Nor am I hesitant about saying that had I stood for the old order the monarchy would not have gone so quickly or surely . A long and terrible civil war would probably have resulted . Some of my critics , both at home and abroad , think they see in my order for the official resumption of Confucianism a reversion to all things old . Without reason they couple Confucianism and monarchism . And when they do this they betray their ignorance of the founder of our great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal blood nor favorable to royalty . He was a sincere and humble man ? like the Christian Saviour ; and was not in the favor of the rulers of his time . I am a believer in Confucius ? and so are you ; and so are all Christian men and women , for the Great Sage taught Truth . Jesus taught Truth and humility and love . They taught the same ; one on one side of the earth , the other on the other . Were they living on earth today they would be firm friends , teaching side by side , and telling men how to live . There is no political significance in this reaffirmation of our national belief in the Great Sage , unless it might be taken that the closer knitting together of a people in morals and ethics had political significance . If the United States were to declare Christianity to be the religion of the country would that mean that the United States was committed to some special form of government ? It would not so appear to me ; for religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulates his conduct . THE REPUBLIC WILL NOT FAIL If the Republic of China should fail ? and I declare now that it will not , if the decision is to rest with me and my supporters ? I would repeat in lamentation the dying phrases of the Great Teacher : " Tai shan , ki tui hu ! " ( The great mountain is broken ! ) " Liang muh , ki huai hu ! " ( The strong beam is thrown down ! ) " Chi jin , ki wei hu ! " ( The wise man is decayed ! ) It is true that there have been loud calls from some sections of the country for a return to the monarchial form ; and it is equally true that as late as yesterday the Council of State advised that I issue an order for the assembling of a citizens ' convention to act on a new constitution . The order will be issued , It is now being prepared , and will be sent out to all the officials within a fortnight . I expect that the convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it will take important action . But not any of this relates to the changing of the form of government , altho I hope for many changes in the administration of certain departments and particularly as relates to the powers of the executive and to the methods of provincial elections . The question of reverting to a monarchial form may be brought up ; I presume it will , and that it will be discussed earnestly and at considerable length ; but there is not the remotest chance that the royalists will be in a majority . It has been urged in certain quarters that a republic was not of a strength sufficient to cope with enemies within and without the State , and many unthinking and poorly informed people have been led to believe this . In truth China was never so well able to defend herself against internal and alien foes as at  | present . I do not mean to say that we have such foes , at least that we have any immediate fears of them ; but the Republic is stronger in actually developed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLAIMS EXAGGERATED The supposed claims of Japan have been wickedly exaggerated by those who do not want to see peace exist between the two nations ; and in the Western world the press has published widely that the Japanese are exerting and asserting political and commercial authority thruout China . And upon this feature I wish your journals would speak plainly , without misquoting me . Japan is not pursuing a policy of aggression with us . The Government of the Mikado is conducting all business with China thru regular channels , and in a regular , routine , diplomatic and friendly manner . That Government has made many requests since the British-Japanese occupation of Kiao-chau . Some of these requests ? they were never in the nature of demands nor accompanied by threats ? have been granted , others have been refused . Still others are under diplomatic consideration . We have received assurances from Japan that the concession of Kiaochau , from which the Germans were ousted by Great Britain and Japan , is to be held by the two nations only until such a time as full adjustments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the termination of the present war . Japanese occupation of Manchuria is with our consent and with the approval of the United States , Russia and Great Britain . The maximum number of troops to . be quartered in the pi-evince is 72,000 ; and when this number was exceeded by nearly 100 , - 000 some months ago , we protested and the excess troops were at once withdrawn . We did not know at the time that these were extra forces held for possible service in Europe , and that their quartering in Manchuria was intended to be but temporary . It is not true that Japan has in any sense secured control of the Central China iron mines , the iron works at Hankow , or any other mines or works within our territory outside the province of Manchuria . Nor have concessions been granted Japan or any other nation in the Shen-si and Shan-si coal fields . These fields , the most extensive and valuable in the world , are owned and will continue to be owned solely by the people of China . We have let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other large centers that we are ready to grant private or corporate concessions for the working of vast coal areas , as well as for zinc and copper mining in Yun-nan and marble quarrying in various provinces ; along with railway concessions necessary for the profitable working of them ; but no government , Japan or any other , has been or will be given control over China 's natural resources . While Manchuria can supply Japan arid Korea with fuel for a century and a half , the Shen-si and Shan-si coal areas can keep the world warm for 2000 years . German Government engineers first surveyed the latter fields in 1886 , 1887 and 1888 , and in 1892 Germany made a secret offer to China to mine the coal and pay her 63 cents per ton for it , and to enter into a contract covering the life of the mines ; but the offer was declined . As for foreign military aides , a large number of Japanese drillmasters have been employed here at the capital and at Tientsin , Nanking , Shanghai and Canton in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of our own citizens become proficient the services of the foreigners are dispensed with . Personally , as Viceroy of Shantung , and afterward as Viceroy of Chihli , I had in my service many German engineers and tacticians and some few of these still remain . A number of German as well as British officers were employed in the national forces and at the chief training school , but only a very limited number of these are now in China . I expect that within three years ? five at most ? there will not be a foreigner , in the strict sense , in either our army or our navy . A CHINESE MERCHANT MARINE I have of late months had many conferences with Chinese capitalists regarding the establishing of a Chinese merchant marine , and I may say that a number of important projects are on foot . Now that we are at last beginning to realize the tremendous extent of our natural resources and the great need for their proper development , we naturally think of becoming a commercial and manufacturing people . We are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our mines and to build our railroads we must have machinery , and in order to get our machinery without being wholly at the mercy of foreign steamship lines , we are compelled to think of the possibilities that await us on the ocean . I may say that the establishment of one or more first-class lines of ships between China and the United States is just now occupying the thought of some of our ablest men . We have capitalists who are amply able to finance such projects , and I confidently expect that within a year ? secured by purchase ? or within three years , if we must have them built , great vessels will fly the Chinese mercantile flag in the harbors of New York and San Francisco . But for the European war many millions of British , Belgian and American capital would now be made use of in the furthering of new enterprises and China would be fully entered upon an era of long-postponed commercial development . I have a list of some thirty large enterprises , each of them involving the expenditure of from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were projected for 1915 , 1916 and 1917 , but which , I suppose , must now await more satisfactory world conditions . Still , we are not feeling the effects of the war as seriously as some of the other neutral nations , for we are thankfully very remote from this horrible and unnecessary butchery and waste . Both our friends and our enemies are engaged in this suicide of nations ? we are sorry for all of them !
