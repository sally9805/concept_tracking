Crowds in Los Angeles Quiet . Perhaps because of the mystery which has attended the journey of the prisoners - the interest in their arrival here was Very great Thousands gathered in the Vicinity of the Santa Fe station before ? noott to-day , although every one knew that the overland limited on which the prisoners were believed to be was not due for another two and one-half hours . It was shortly after 2 when word was telephoned to some one in the crowd ' bout the station that the train had been stopped at the station in Pasadena and James R. and had been put in an automobile and taken to the county jail At the Pasadena Station there had been a curious throng but an orderly one , and there was not a sound from it when tee prisoners left . The news of the trick made the crowd about- the-al'atTor  --  iaere- ssatter and run for the jail . People gathered on the lawn of the Court House , packed the windows Of that building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street . It was ' twenty minutes of three when the car containing Sicalanigle and James B. appeared . The crowd greeted it with a cheer , but whether that was a sign of relief at the end of the waiting or was intended for the detectives er even the prisoners no one could say . Two minutes later the automobile bearing John J. , Detectives WY Biddinger of the Chicago office , S. J. Smith of the Burns forces , and Hosick of Los Angeles rolled into sight from the opposite direction . The union official was taken off at Raymond Station . Again there was a slight cheer and some hissing , ' taut a cordon of police moved forward and the noise stopped . The crowd wp.s still until the automobile was emptied . and the prisoner was standing at the gate of the jail . Then there came a surge forward , and before the police could interfere was surrounded by a mass of gaping faces . All they wanted , however , was to see , and the attempt at rescue that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Arrest . It was in the office of the jail that the elder first learned of the arrest of the others . He had been put aboard the same ? train at Fort Dodge , Iran. , but was kept in another car . He was kept from talking with anyone or reading the papers . Even when the train reached Pasadena and his brother and were transferred to the automobile , he did not learn of their arrest . As he entered the office of the jail he was suddenly confronted by the sight of his brother . He is evidently very fond of his frail relative . At the sight of the other prisoner surrounded by a half-dozen detectives he was plainly shocked . His . face paled perceptibly and he asked for a chair with a gesture of his manacled hands . In a few seconds , however , he recovered himself and his face cleared . After the first glance he did not look toward his brother ' until the latter left the office in charge of Jailer Gallagher . Younger Weak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this morning , when the train was at Barstftw , Cal. , James learned of the ' story that had made revelations to detectives and implicated his former " pal , " the Secretary of the union , and others . The effect of this information was to bisak down the Stoic reserve which he had shown since his arrest in Detroit . When he reached the County Jail he was almosf exhausted , but maintained his outer air of composure . His face was white and he coughed incessantly . His fingers , yellowed by tobacco , for he rolls and smokes continually , flickered and twitched about his rather weak mouth . and twice as he stood before the desk he staggered and had to be held . He made - no complaint , and refused to make any statement even after the Sheriff gave bins permission . Nfalanigie evidently does not know that his reyelations have been made public . Be kept up an air of bravado  --  far more so than that of either of the others . In the train this morning , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit his picture to be taken , he . said : " If you bring a camera in this compartment I 'll throw it out of the window and you after it " - Otherwise he attempted to give the imperssion of good humor and confidence . Be is , evidently worried , for he is reported to have said to one of his guards this morning : " So it was the Loa Angeles jobs you fellows wanted us for . I thought it was when you pinched us in Detroit . " Ample Defense , Says . John J. talked of his case in his cell this evening . Ills appearance was prepossessing , . Under a broad forehead are widely spaced eyes . with clusters of little wrinkles about their corners . " ,  - -  144s mouth is large and well formed . and - his head is well formed and large , almost massive. , He was well and quietly . dressed in , dark , snugly fitting clothes . Be-was pale and looked slightly haggard . 1:1 " statement was quick and direct : ? . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he began . " I have had nothing to say since I was forcibly removed from my office last Saturday . I have just learned of my brother 's arrest . Why is he here ? " He was told that his brother was ac : cused of having discharged the bomb that destroyed The Times building and the . lives of twenty-two employes . " Oh , but that is absurd , " he rejoined " Why  --  but the whole thing Is a frame up , pure and simple . I might as well be the goat as any one else  --  and my brother . , have they the same charge against him or have they something up their sleeves ? " When told that was accused of having destroyed the Llewellyn Iron Works on Christmas morning , he said : " Oh , well , it will all come out in due time . When I Was seized in my office they gave me no chance to wind up my business or my personal affairs . " He tossed his head . " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't mind talking to you about any subject on the face of the earth save only this case . I have many reasons for remaining silent al this stage of the proceedings , and my friends throughout the country and that part of the public that believes me innocent , if there be any who do , must watt until the time comes . I have a good defense , an ample defense , but 1 need hardly point out that it would be poor policy for me to give any inkling of it now . Wait the trial . That will be open and the whole world will then learn the inside truth of this case . Until then I must keep silent . Nothing is ever gained by merely talking to hearthe sound of the words . That is all . " Shields Face from Woman . When James stepped off the train at Pasadena he walked almost into the arms of Mrs. D. H. Ingersoll of San Francisco , who had been brought here to Identify him , if possible , as J. B. Bryce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case .

" said Mrs. Ingersoll , as she turned to a woman from the District Attorney office . who had accompanied her . " le he had not nursed his hand I could be certain . As It is I feel pretty sure he is the man . " O. N.

Mr. Hilton defended Charles H. Moyer and George Pettibone. members of the Western Federation of Miners , in the Steunenberg case . He declared that the action of the union forces of Indianapolis in arresting men for kidnapping was " horse play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Judge Hilton . 4 ' Do n't the attorneys here know that the Supreme Court of the United States decided In the case of Hay'wood that the action of the authorities In arresting Moyer , Pettibone , and Haywood was final , and that no appeal could be made from it ? Such methods as they are trying to employ in Indianapolis are silly . They will gain nothing . " Neither the Sheriff , the Chief ( if Police . nor F. E. Mills . agent for Burns . would confirm or deny the report current here this afternoon that the arrest of a prominent labor leader of San Francisco was contemplated by the authorities . The arrest of this labor leader , it is asserted , will be followed in short order by the imprisonment of another man , prominent In local labor circles .

They shall have every opportunity of seeing and conferring with their lawyers and their personal friends . hut the curious public will be barred from the jolt .
