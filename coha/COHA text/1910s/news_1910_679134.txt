txt Four West Point cadets , all members of the first or senior class at the Military Academy , who have been on trial before a general courtIonartial for several ' weeks past , . charged with drinking a milk I punch , have been found guilty and their dismissal from the academy recommended to the President . The papers were submitted to the President by Adjt . Gen. Ainsworth , and the President , after reading the evidence , approved the sentence , and then commuted. it to what is perhaps the severest punishment , not involving dismissal , in the history of the academy . The cadets who were ' proved to have partaken of the punch and all of whom are effected by the President 's review of the case are Wilfrid Mason Blunt of Maryland , Charles Laurence Byrne of WashinE , , , ton , D. C. ; ( tarry James Keeley of Illinois , and Bethel Wood Simpson of Michigan . Blunt and Byrne are . sons of retired officers , while Simpson 's father is Major Wendell Simpson , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this city . Col. Byrne , the rather of another of the cadets , is an ' ex-Surgeon General of the Department of the East , on Governors Island . The predicament into which the cadets got themselves was the result of a little celebration they got up when they became first classmen , last June . Nobody knows how they got the whisky that was dropped into the punch , neither is it , known how the quart of milk that was another of the principal , ingredients was smuggled into barracks . Rumor has it , however , that " some kind friend " brought in the stuff that made all the trouble . There is no regulation of the academy that is more drastic than the one relating to intoxicating drinks , the punishment for drinking or having intoxicants in one 's possession being dismissal from the service of the United States , and as the cadets in this case were all upper classmen there is no doubt that they realized that they were taking their careers in their hands when they decided to make the punch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mill : , a plat of rye whisky , two grated nutmegs , half a cop of sugar , two lemons , and the skin of one orange . The name of the cadet whc made it was net made public : ? but ' the ' impression- in the Hudson Highlands is that it tasted good . None of the cadets drank much of the puitch for the good reason that there was not a sufficient quantity on hand for more than two drinks for those who congregated in that darkened room on the night in question . There was no hilarity connected with the making of the punch , and nobody would probably have ever heard of It had not First Lieut . Benjamin H. Grey , Twenty-firs ? United States Infantry , who was the officer in charge that night , in the course of the evening made a tour of the barracks . Up to the mitnent that Lieut . Grey began that inspection which was to have such disastrous results for four of the cadets who were in the room where tile punch was there had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than five years , and great was Grey 's surprise when , as he entered the room , he whiffed something ist the air that reminded him of the gilded drinking palaces of Broadway . " What 's this ? " asked Grey , drawing in anot ! ier long breath . There was a scurrying of feet , and when the lights were turned on only six cadets remained in the room . Two of them were able to prove that they had not tasted of the punch , and so they did not figure in the dismissal recommendations that were sent to President Taft a few days ago . Lieut . Grey ordered the cadets to retire to their cots for the night , and the next morning the matter was officially brought to the attention of Col. Scott , the Superintendent , who , under the regulations , was compelled to bring all of the accused before a general court-martial , the court In this case being one of the largest in point of numbers that has sat at West Point in years . There were thirteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Judge Advocate who prosecuted the cases , The court was as follows : Capt . Ora E. Hunt , Thirtieth Infantry . Capt . Thomas W. Darrah , Twenty-seventh Infantry . Capt . George B. Pillsbury , Corps of Engineers . Capt . Otho V. Kean , Ordnance Department . First Lieut . Richard M. Thomas , Fifteenth Cavalry . First Lieut . William D. A. Anderson , Corps of Engineers , First Lieut . George R. Allin , Sixth Field Artillery . First Lieut , William Bryden , Fifth Field Artillery . First Lieut . Benjamin H. L. Williams , Coast Artillery Corps . First Lieut . Forrest E. Williford , Coast Artillery Corps . First Lieut . Samuel M. Parker , Twentieth Infantry . Second Lieut . Henry E. Mitchell , Third Cavalry . Second Lieut . Frederick W. Manley , Thirteenth Infantry . First Lieut . Hurry S. Grier , Twenty-second InfantrY , Judge Advocate . For weeks the hearing lasted and scores of cadets were called as witnesses . On only four , however , could the court fasten guilt and these four were recommended for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few days ago , gave them careful study and then decided that dismissal was a little too severe , and so he figured out a less severe punishment which would not carry with it a dismissal from the academy . The President accordingly remitted that part of the sentence that fixed dismissal as the penalty and fixed up a new punishment . This is what he did . At the ? present time the cadets are in camp and the President ordered that Byrne , Blunt , Simpson , and Keeley were to be confined to their company street until the close of the encampment . which will be to-morrow , and that after that and up to and including March 31 , 1911 , they were to be confined to the areas of the cadet barracks and the gymnasium . This was not all by any means . The President also ordered that each of the cadets beginning to-morrow and up to and including March 31 , 1911 , must Walk " armed and equipped as a soldier " In the area of the barracks every Wednesday afternoon from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and every Saturday from 2 P. M. until the parade call . As a result none of the cadets affected by the sentence will see a football game the coming season , neither will they be allowed to pay " party calls " on the girls , nor will they have a chance to attend a single - cadet , hop until next Spring , Every football game scheduled to be played at ' Nest Point this year will be played on the Saturdays when Byrne , Blunt , Keeley , and Simpson are walking .
