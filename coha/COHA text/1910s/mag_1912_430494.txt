I N popular thought peace means the absence , war the pres ence , of the strenuous and the heroic . However earnestly one may believe in the righteousness of the peace cause , one unconsciously feels at a disadvantage when argument falls into this particular line . Would you banish the strenuous or heroic from human life ? One naturally answers , No ; and forthwith the militarist chalks down a score in his favor , for he assumes as self-evident that these are distinctly military virtues and that they are in danger of being lost if war be done away with . How strong is the hold of this idea , even upon educated minds , may be seen in the utterances of the late Professor William James , who in a monograph , The Moral Equivalent of War , published a short time before his death , frankly recognized the force of the militarist claim , though he rated himself as " squarely in the anti-militarist party " and considered war " absurd and impossi ble from its own monstrosity . " Similarly , other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have felt it incumbent to provide some " equivalent " which shall conserve the virtues of militarism after war has become a thing of the past . Let us examine the grounds of this persistent belief and de termine if war really is essential to the development of true heroism or vigor of action in either individuals or nations . In the first place , in plain justice to militarism itself , let us divest the term heroism of its tawdry garniture ? everything of a drummajor , opera-bouffe , or pomp-and-circumstance character ? and if possible discover what is the genuine underlying reality . Ety mologists trace the Greek word hero to the same origin as the Latin word vir , and the hero thus becomes simply man ? man , however , in that loftier sense of which we catch some glimpse in the word manly . The hero is he in whom manliness , or the manly virtues , stand forth , on occasion of great crisis , in extraor dinary brilliancy , and who exhibits , as the lexicographers put it , " unusual courage , firmness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished valor , intrepidity or enterprise in dan ger . " Two conditions , not to mention lesser incidental ones , are essential to any act of heroism . The motive for the act must be good , worthy , or noble , and the act must involve voluntary selfsacrifice . In other words the hero gives up , or offers to give up , or voluntarily risks the loss of , something dear to himself for the accomplishment of what he believes to be a worthy pur pose . While heroism , in its deeper meaning , is properly an attribute of moral courage , it is universally associated in the popu lar mind with physical courage . This is very natural and in a sense very just , for its ultimate expression is sacrifice of life . If a man gives his life he has made the grand sacrifice , for he has given himself . " Greater love hath no man than this , that a man lay down his life for his friends . " And so , the world over and in all ages , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescue a fellow from peril , to protect the honor of woman , to save from danger those for whom one is responsible , to serve one 's country or to defend one 's religion ? has commanded the homage and admiration of men . Now war , as the author has elsewhere said , is the " supreme catastrophe to human life . " When a man goes to war he goes where the insurance companies will not follow him . Sickness , exposure , fatigue , to say nothing of battle , are the fearful menace which makes home partings at the outbreak of war so unlike all other domestic trials . Those who go away to these certain dangers are invested by their neighbors with an aroma of heroism of which nothing but cowardice or dishonor can ever thereafter deprive them . But even here , the halo which rests upon the soldier 's life must be drawn away for the moment , if we are to get at a true estimate of its heroic quality ; and when this is done it will be found in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the elements of our definition are absent . The point may be waived that in many , probably most , wars a worthy motive is entirely lacking ? that is a matter with which the indi vidual soldier has very little to do . But so far as he serves un willingly or under compulsion , as is the case with the great ma jority in most wars of long duration , the element of voluntary  | self-sacrifice is lacking . Such service may entitle him to syrnpa thy and lasting consideration from his Government , but it has not the heroic quality . It places him rather in the category of many of those helpless victims of the Terror in the French Revo lution who became involved in a general catastrophe without ref erence to any question of principle or voluntary sacrifice on their part . To such service the term heroic can not be applied in its true sense , as it can , for instance , to the conduct of an officer who stands by his ship and goes down with her to save others when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , furnishes exam ples of genuine heroism when men voluntarily and on principle take up their country 's cause , even in the humblest ranks , without expectation of personal reward ; but it is one of the most difficult things in the world to say when this is true and when it is not ; and an indulgent Government generally spreads the mantle of charity over all alike and enters upon its roll of honor all who have served it in its hour of danger . But while war , in the very nature of things , abounds in op portunities for valorous exploits , and its every deed is written large on the page of history , the humbler and quieter sphere of private life affords even more and keener opportunities for the display of true heroism . The physician or nurse who volun tarily goes into a plague-stricken district , the miner who braves the fire-damp to rescue his imprisoned fellows , the crew who stand at their posts while their vessel is sinking , the fireman who scales a tottering wall to save a human life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal risk ? whoever in the pursuance of duty , no matter how humble , subordinates his personal safety to that duty ? is as much entitled to the com mendation of heroism as a soldier who does his duty in war can possibly be . These opportunities for heroic deeds are everywhere with us and always will be . They may lack the glamour of war and may go unblazoned to the world , but the very humbleness of their status enhances , if anything , their heroic quality . When , therefore , Professor James refers to our " unwillingness to see the supreme theatre war of human strenuousness closed , " he should , in justice , refer to that other theatre , far more impor- tant , which never can be wholly closed . And it seems to the author that his argument admits by implication a fundamental error ? that the closing of the military " theatre of human stren uousness " would suppress in any way the heroic quality in human life . This quality is latent in human nature . War can not cre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its opportunity . Life may pass without such opportunity even once presenting itself , but that does not negative its presence . When the matter is considered from this point of view the fallacy of the argument that war must be continued if we are to perpetuate the heroic in human life is apparent . It amounts to a confusion of the talent itself with the opportunity for its exer cise . No one would think of inviting peril and disaster simply to provide such opportunities . As we do not want holocausts or mine explosions or flood or pestilence in order to give us heroes in action , so we do not want war simply to draw forth the heroic in human nature . Neither do we want these perils for mere efficiency 's sake . Undoubtedly familiarity with danger en ables men to deal with it more effectively . The fireman who has contended with many fires or the ship 's crew who have passed through genuine perils at sea , should naturally be better fitted for their work than those who have been trained by drills alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real veteran . But in none of these cases would we think of inviting the catas trophe simply to acquire the efficiency . The point to be insisted upon is that the progressive elimination of these perils , whether in civil or military life , and with it the opportunities for heroic or strenuous effort , will not result in atrophy or decay of these qualities in themselves ; and they will shine forth in as great bril liancy when the occasion does arise as if it were a daily occur rence . This does not imply that the cultivation of these virtues should be neglected , even if rarely called into action . We do not neglect fire-drills simply because preventive measures may reduce the occasion for their actual application . If heroism thus appears to be not an exclusive attribute of militarism , still less so is strenuousness in individual life . It is impossible to find any rational basis for the idea which Professor James elaborates in his own forceful way , that the supremely  | strenuous life is a military one . " A permanently successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a simple pleasure economy . We must make new energies and hardihoods continue the manli ness to which the military mind so faithfully clings . " It is to be feared that Professor James has here accepted a plausible mili tarist plea without testing its validity . Through what observa tion or experience did he conclude that a peace economy is a sim ple pleasure economy ? Certainly it is not by consulting those who do the real work of the world . The fallacy of this view ? for it clearly is fallacy ? comes from judging the whole by some exceptional part ; from estimating the grand average of military life by some striking feature of endurance and hardship , like the Vicksburg campaign in our Civil War . Such times of stress do indeed inspire us by their proof of man 's prodigious capacity , mental and physical , to undergo exertion and accomplish results . They are times which not only " try men 's souls , " but call into play every power of their being . To use a technical term , they stretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for normal recovery . But taking military life as a whole , it is the soldier that has the easy time and the laborer that has the strenu ous time . We have spoken chiefly of physical courage and toil because they are the most tangible expression of heroism and the strenu ous life ; but in their true significance these qualities are attributes of moral greatness . The highest type of courage is not physical courage , and the highest type of work is not that which can be done by muscular effort alone . It is the higher moral types that come progressively into play as civilization and enlightenment advance , and their " supreme theatre " of action is in peace . The subordination of self-interest to public duty is one of the many examples which call for a higher courage than mere physical peril exacts . To tell the truth to a prejudiced public , to bid defiance to custom when custom is wrong , to use power without favoritism ? how wide is the field of virtue which lies open to him who laments the lapse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elder sister of true physical courage , has yet scarcely entered upon its rightful dominion . Its acts may not be rewarded with medals of honor , nor its actors be officially labelled  | heroes , but it is nevertheless the very essence of true greatness in human nature . An example of mock heroism which comes from subordi nating moral courage to physical is seen in the decaying institu tion of duelling . The duel is the refuge of the moral coward . While the challenge may find a weak spot in mere physical cour age , it far oftener sacrifices the finer qualities of moral courage . How many men in the past have thrown away lives which they were bound to conserve , have robbed families of support , have sacrificed their usefulness , in short have been false to every con consideration of true heroism , simply because they were afraid to refuse a challenge ! With fine sarcasm General Grant says in his memoirs : " I do not believe I would ever have the courage to fight a duel . " And Carlyle expresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says : " God must needs laugh outright , could such a thing be , to see his wondrous manikins here below ! " Closely akin to this false standard of heroism is the grandilo quent hypocrisy of martial proclamations and manifestoes of many of even the world 's greatest generals and rulers . Let one gather together this class of literature in the past two centuries and it will constitute in the mass , though there are noble excep tions , a monument to the insincerity and credulity of human na ture which would be unbelievable if it were not so well authenti cated . To associate the quality of heroism with depravity of that sort is to debase it beyond recognition . The subject has so far been treated from the point of the individual ; equally pertinent , however , is the argument when ap plied to the State as a whole . For the heroic and the strenuous are a vital feature of national as of individual character . There are duties to be performed , work to be done , which society in its collective capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think of war as the only enterprise which can call forth the combined energies of a people ; yet this view is really a sur vival of the long past in which war has been the one such enterprise . But times have changed . Now , at least , if not heretofore , there is work on a grand scale worthy of the highest devo tion of a nation 's efforts . There arc battles to he fought -- -with  | nature and with man ? not less important than the battles of old , though their fields of action may not be baptized , as they were then , in men 's blood . Perhaps the idea can be best illustrated by a concrete exam ple . In 1898 this Government fought a short and decisive war to accomplish a definite purpose . Stripped of certain unpleasant features which no great movement can wholly escape , its purpose was wholly altruistic ? the correction of political abuses which otherwise might have continued indefinitely . The war cost a great deal of money , many lives , and involved some unexpected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole posterity will ap prove it as something necessary to be done and which apparently could not have been done with the same thoroughness in any other way . Since that time we have undertaken another war-for it is not a violent stretch of fancy to apply this term to the conquest of Panama . It is a war against the obstacles of nature , against disease and pestilence , its purpose truly national and worthy , and its magnitude beyond the resources of any lesser agency than the Government . Its cost is about the same as what the Spanish War would have cost , if managed on an efficient basis . The number of men , with the length of time engaged , make a greater amount of service than the armed struggle required . Now while these two great and necessary tasks fell to our nation to accomplish , the second is by far the more valuable and inspiring as an example for the future . It is constructive without involving destruction . Instead of accomplishing a work through the agency of armed conflict with all its debasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is greater efficiency , equal earnestness and devotion , a higher moral tone , and with it all a combination of effort which the most thoroughly organized military movement would find it diffi cult to surpass . More than this , the experience gained by those who serve in this great campaign will be of direct value when they return to ordinary vocations , whereas the effect of war serv ice is rather to disqualify . Incidentally , and perhaps most im portant of all , is the definite proof which this enterprise furnishes that Government ? the agency of a people acting collectively ?  | can grapple with great civil problems as efficiently as with mili tary , as efficiently even as the best organized industrial corpora tions of the present day . As an object lesson in many ways it stands foremost among the mighty achievements of history . As an example of national heroism ? the making of a great sacrifice to accomplish a worthy purpose ? it may rank with the most righteous wars . This superb example of national effort should become a mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the militarist claim that without war real concentration of national energy is impossible . And it places before peace advocates a higher ideal than they are generally credited with holding . Peace , permanent peace , should not mean relaxation of effort so much as diversion of effort into worthier channels . If the sole purpose of disarmament were to reduce taxation , it would not be in the fullest sense worth while . Sacrifice , effort , self-denial are essential to healthy development with nations as with men . A people should never begrudge a generous contribution to the common purse , if assured that it will be used for a worthy end . National defence is indeed such an end , so long as danger of aggression exists ; but the pursuits of peace are more to be desired . Tribute so used is constructive , not destructive ; increase , not waste ; human uplift , whereas too often war is the exact opposite . And these possibilities are not confined to the conquest of material nature ; they include the conquest of the evil side of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ castle , so often used as a base of operations in despoiling the surround ing country and exacting tribute from the weak , no longer exists as a physical fact ; but there do exist more powerful and relentless tyrannies in the superior sagacity , skill and other intellectual gifts by which to a great extent the products of human effort go to those not entitled to them . The myriad legions of graft ? that term which so aptly describes the chief iniquity of social conditions in this and every other age ? are ever in the field to be fought and overcome . Social problems of tremendous mag nitude await the earnest energy of minds now devoted to the problems of war . In this invisible theatre of action the mighti- est campaigns and hardest battles of civilization still remain to be fought . War against physical nature and the evils of human nature and their ultimate subjugation to the intellectual and spiritual dominion of man , constitute a struggle which will give ample scope to the energies of the race beyond our remotest ken . ' We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as there are mountain barriers to be overcome , floods to be controlled , deserts and swamps to be reclaimed ; or so long as men are de nied equal opportunities , and " predatory wealth " has any other than a historic meaning , man need not feel that war is necessary to call forth the best there is in him . The age of true heroism , the age of the ideal " strenuous life " ? when some philosopher of the distant future shall write a history of civilization ? will not be that of Alexander or Caesar or Napoleon , but of those later periods when the energy of the race is directed to friendly cooperation instead of bloody conflict or incessant preparation therefor . It will be an age in which every virtue of militarism will find a higher and fuller expression , while its manifest vices , and particularly the horrors of war , will be laid aside . Let na tions wage all the Panama wars that they like ? the more the better : ? but let them outgrow as rapidly as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
