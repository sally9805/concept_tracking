I N June of this year , cotton sold for more than 27 cents a pound , or nearly S14o a bale , the highest price paid for upland staple in more than 40 years . In September , 1914 , the writer was walking along the streets of a town located in the Georgia cotton belt . The few stores were empty , the streets silent , the people preoccupied and gloomy . Suddenly an old negro lunged from an office shanty and came staggering down the street roaring with laughter . His outburst echoed through the town in contrast to the depressing aspect of the general environment . " What 's the matter , uncle ? " I asked . " Why , boss , " he began , and extended a palm in which there were probably fifteen or twenty dollars in bills and small coin . " Why , boss ? ha , ha , ? I'se lafin ' ? yaw , yaw , yaw ? I'se lafin ' ? eyow ! ! ? jes ' to keep from cryin ' ! " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year to produce a crop of cotton . The elements smiled on his efforts ; there had never been a better crop year ; as had rarely been the case before with big yield in prospect , prices had held up . Cotton was quoted at 12 to 13 cents throughout the spring and most of the summer . Not since the Civil War was the outlook more propitious for great prosperity throughout the South ? until a pistol shot in Sarajevo cut the tendons of trade . For a bale of cotton for which he had expected to receive from $6o to $75 , the o1 ( 1 negro had managed to wheedle a pittance of $15 or $20 from some kindly white friend ? and was " lafin ' to keep from cryin ' Majestic King Cotton had been dethroned by the angry god Mars . The great staple , which in July had commanded the abiesance of the financial world , was forced in September to " pass the hat " to a generous country . The " Buy a Bale " movement bordered on an appeal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic brought home to the South what economists had been teach- ing for two generations , the danger in a one-crop agrictilturc So in 1915 there was a great fall-off in the production o cotton ; it continued in 1916 ; and , despite marvelously high prices , there is another acreage reduction this year and a prospective short crop . Quite to the surprise of even the best experts , war ; instead of lessening , quickened the demand for cotton . During the last three years consumption has greatly exceeded production . But nature , in seeming anticipation of the coming cataclysm , took pains in 1914 to lay up the largest surplus of cotton that the world has ever possessed . It is that surplus which has enabled the mills of America and Europe ? excepting Germany and Austria ? to keep going at a rate unprecedented in the annals of cotton manufacturing . COTTON 'S ROMANCE AND TRAGEDY No commercial romance or tragedy of all the war is more unique than that of cotton . Less than three years ago , it was without a market ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 7 cents a pound ; ten months ago it brought nearly 22 cents a pound ; then it dropped to 13 ; then it came back in midsummer , 1917 , when it reached 27 cents ; and in a year it may . Candidly , prediction is futile , for cotton is one thing that has defied the most expert and confounded the wisest . In late 1914 , no one expected cotton to sell for more than 10 cents a pound until after the war . In the spring of 1916 , when it scorned both bull and bear and climbed upwards to 13/ , I-I . L. McElroy , a broker 's expert , put forth this seemingly timid suggestion : " If peace or rumors of peace should develop before another new crop can be planted , who will venture to predict that 20-cent cotton is not a possi-bility ? He was laughed at by the habitues of Beaver and Broad streets , New York ; yet before the fall of 1916 had half passed , men scrambled to get cotton at 21 cents , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1916 the writer made some inquiries among the cotton crowd . The bulls were then firm in the conviction that the then advance would stand or go forward ? provided the U-boats did n't come .  | " Cotton can stand anything but that , " said the bulls . " Ruthless U-boat warfare will send the market back to the Sargossa Sea . " The U-boats came and the bulls scrambled to unload . On February 1 the market crashed ; amid riots of demoralization in the cotton exchanges of New York , Liverpool , and New Orleans , prices fell 40 per cent in an hour . Then , despite the panic over the U-boats , the market recovered by force of its own unsupported momentum , and next day prices were back within reaching distance of previous high levels ! The U-boats did their work , and at their worst actually aided in sending cotton prices to the highest points reached in four decades . The decline in volume of British stocks , caused by the destruction of shipping , emphasized the world 's dependence on America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the diplomatists gather to retouch the world 's physiognomy and define the beginning of a new age , a product of mother earth in the uppermost thoughts of those shrewd gamblers for advantage will be cotton . Commerce more than geography will prompt thought and action at that greatest of diplomatic congresses . There will be no dream of commercial conquest in which cotton wo n't be a dominant figure ; and the most baffling nightmare to all Europe 's players for commercial vantage will be Dixie Land . For our own South is supplying the bulk of the world 's raw cotton and whatever the future may portend or make possible , from Dixie must be drawn most of the staple with which the world 's textile trade will be reorganized . That trade is a most significant factor in world commerce . With it has gone commercial empire . It might be said without great exaggeration that the flag follows the shirt . Around it dominance in the Pacific revolves , together with trade supremacy in South America ? which questions will haunt , as few others will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by diplomats will decide the course of centuries .  | The whirligig of events bids fair to make the Smith which , iii a commercial sense , was most debased by - lie out break of war , the keeper of a master key to the inner comfiercial problems crystallized by and growing out of the war . Events are more than bearing out the assertion made by Ambassador Page that " the cotton grower in the old slave States is to become the most prosperous tiller of the soil . " They are making him a figure around which the rebuilding of empires may revolve . LAST YEAR 'S CROP Last year 's harvest of cotton was perhaps the most profitable agricultural crop ever grown on a large scale . It was produced at an average cost of 8 or 9 cents a pound , and sold at from 17 to 25 cents . Still this large profit , when added to his profits of the previous twenty years and balanced against his losses in those years , left the Southern farmer with not much more than an " even break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he began to grow cotton , the Southern planter can look forward to reasonably certain high prices for his staple for the next five or six years , and probably longer . This opinion is shared by virtually every variety of thought in the cotton world . Many , however , believe he can look forward to more than " high prices ; " that he may anticipate bonanza-like returns . During the season of 1915-16 we produced a total of 12,000,000 bales , including linters , while there were consumed at least 14,000,000 bales . Though the production of the last season was a few hundred thousand more bales , consumption perhaps was greater than in the previous one . In May , 1914 , there were in operation 31,000,000 American spindles ; in May , 1916 , 32,200,000 ; in May , 1917 , 33,450,000 . In addition , heavy demand caused an unusually heavy output per spindle . Ammunition is accounting for more than I , 000,000 bales yearly . Fifty thousand bales were shot away in the first attack on . the Dardanelles . The stringency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that our government had difficulty in obtaining cloth to clothe the new army , which will be sheltered mostly in wooden barracks because of the scarcity of canvas for tents .  | Government needs alone , due to our entering the war , give reasonable assurance that there will be no lessening of demand for cotton products during the next year . The immense surplus of cotton piled up by the zenith crop of 1914 has been absorbed . At the beginning of the new statistical year on August 1 , the visible supplies of the world were less than 3,000,000 bales , enough to feed the world 's spindles only two months . The visible supplies of American cotton were only 1,500,000 bales , about the normal floating carry-over . It is a logical deduction , however , that the epochal high prices of mid-summer drew from concealment virtually all cotton heretofore classed as " invisible supply " and amounting ordinarily from 700,000 to 800,000 bales . The same high prices caused some reduction in American mill stocks ; and , together with shipping difficulties , they lowered stocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Analysis of the statistics of the situation should greatly discount the customary approximation of the world 's visible supplies on August I. A forced curtailment of consumption , , in England would be made up for mostly by increased consumption later on . It may be taken for granted , however , that every effort will be made to avoid curtailment . Britain has fought for its foreign cotton goods trade as valiantly as for Ypres , and despite the vagaries of war has not only held most of it but has taken over much of Germany 's . Nothing less than a defeat in Flanders would be more disastrous than the loss of that trade . Germany 's yearnings for the selfsame trade helped to bring on the war . So long as British ships ply the Atlantic , bottoms will be allotted to cotton . THIS YEAR 'S CROP Much depends on the crop now being harvested in the South . Even without peace , the world will need 15,000,000  | bales of American cotton during the present season . Before the war , experts agreed that world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American crop of tha amount . Cotton is the basis of most of the propulsive explosive ; employed . So important is it as an adjunct of battle that many believe that had it been excluded from Germany at the start , the war could have been ended in a year . During the months when it was permitted to enter German ports , the empire accumulated a surplus directly and through nearby neutrals . This may have enabled it to tide over the period necessary to changing old guns and manufacturing new ones suitable for nitro-cellulose made from wood fibre . As I write this , early in August , the maximum prospect is for a crop of only about 12,000,000 bales . Added to reduced acreage , climatic conditions were poor through most of the summer . There was some improvement in the latter part of July , but the crop is late , which enhances the danger of early frost and appreciably increases the boll weevil 's opportunities . With the Southern farmer cotton is a habit . The neartragedy of 1914 , when the ghost of hunger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon him than all the lecturing and newspaper editorializing on the one-crop evil of the past half century . But it could n't quite uproot habit . So deeply embedded is this habit that , I verily believe , did conditions make the cultivation of cotton wholly and prospectively unprofitable , it would take the period of a generation to wean Southern farmers from it . This was proven in the nineties , when thousands pyramided mortgages and went half famished on a constant diet of the plainest corn meal and white bacon in limited quantities , to produce cotton at almost certain loss when they could have easily abandoned the staple and lived comfortably , i f not luxuriously , by growing home necessities alone . And it is likewise proven by the tenacity with which many in some boll weevil section cling to cotton when profit in producing it is next to impossible . COTTON AFTER THE WAR Germany and Austria have been without cotton over two years . Therefore , a normal market for nearly 5,000 , - 000 bales has been suspended . You can accumulate clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the war ends , their normal or usual needs will not only exist , but also the accumulated needs of several years . One of the first things they will do will be to start their cotton mills on day and night time , which means an outlet the first year of peace for four or five million bales of cotton ? virtually additional to present demand . Cotton has practically no substitutes , but may be one for all other clothing products . It is generally believed among cotton experts that the Germans already own about 800,000 bales of American cotton bought for reserve at less than to cents and never delivered . The most interesting speculation of all has to do with that fight which will follow peace for the textile trade of the world , now largely torn from its old moorings by the exigencies of war . For with the textile trade , goes dominance in many lines . With raw cotton scarce , as it seems bound to be , the country possessing most will be best armed for that fight . And one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present contest of guns may be a battle royal between the nations for control of Dixie 's supply of cotton . These speculations seem fanciful , but no more so than predictions two and a half years ago of what already has occurred would have been . And they are no more startling than the career of cotton during and following our own Civil War . The cotton planter 's good fortune has been exceeded by that of the cotton manufacturer .. Meteoric rises in the price of the raw material were outdistanced by increased demand , and consequent rising prices , of the manufactured product . Some of the most bearish experts , say manufacturers , could have paid 30 cents a pound for cotton during the last year and yet earned unusual profits The chief difficulty  | faced by the mills during the past i8 months has been in filling orders . During the past two years cotton mill earnings have been the highest in history . What of the future ? Dixie has the whip hand . Southern spots have sold steadily above New York futures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taken up by Southern spots refusing to sag . As indicated by Secretary McAdoo , in justifying government aid to Southern growers in 1914 , cotton is as staple as gold . It is imperishable . Strands of lint taken recently from old Egyptian tombs were as pliable as new fibre . William B. Dana long ago said that cotton combined all the qualities of a legal tender to a greater degree than any other commodity except gold . Financial recoupment , brought about through industrial progress and given virility by the Federal Reserve banking act , enables the Dixie farmer to finance his cotton crop . He can " hold " indefinitely . In recent years vast warehouses wherein the staple may be stored cheaply have been constructed throughout the belt . A receipt from a bonded warehouse is as good at a Southern bank as a government bond . A TWO BILLION DOLLAR A YEAR CROP An annual return of over S2,000,000,000 on cotton , including seed and added values to its manufactures , maybe much more , for its one big crop , seems an assurance for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more cotton than the world is producing ; and is willing to pay the South its price . But how about that period following the reorganization of the world 's commerce , that brand-new epoch in trade ? Will the world wrench its garments loose from Dixie 's grasp , and set trip cotton farming on an extensive scale elsewhere ? It is the belief of this writer that it will . The South 's traditional claim that nature has given it an inviolable monopoly in the production of cotton is , in the opinion of most present-day students , a delusion . The Civil  | War test , as so eloquently portrayed by Henry Grady thirty years ago , was falsely accepted as final . For today the outside world is producing twice as much commercial cotton as the South sent to market in 186o , and we furnished only 57 per cent of the 1916 world supply . The former British view that it was impossible to develop competition with the South within the Empire has given way to the firm conviction , based on experiments , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Chairman of the British Cotton Growers ' Association , speaking at London in June , 1914 , declared that it had been " definitely proved that the British Empire can produce the cotton which Lancashire requires " and was going to do it . Professor James A. B. Scherer in his recent book , " Cotton as a World Power , " after quoting the above , declares : " The writer , for many years a believer in the ability of the cotton belt to retain monopolistic control of cotton production , has come to the conclusion after a study of the subject in several different parts of the world that his former opinion was wrong . " Aside from the demonstrated ability to double Egypt 's crop and increase that of India indefinitely , the experiments of the British Cotton Growing Association prove that several sections of Africa , particularly East Africa and Uganda , offer almost illimitable soil facilities for producing cotton . There they have the same labor which makes cotton profitable to the South . The Association 's activities have progressed beyond the experimental ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the throne , and is backed by Parliament as well as the great textile industry of Manchester . In twelve years Russia developed the cotton-growing industry from almost nothing to an annual production of a million and a half bales . Japan is manufacturing more than 2,000,000 bales a year , of which , in normal times , only 250 , - 66o are American . The wizard of the Far East is laying extensive plans to not only supplant American raw cotton and cotton goods in the Orient , but to gain complete control  | of the textile trade in that immense section where are to be staged the Verduns and the Sommes of future world commerce . He is doing the first by encouraging cultivation of the staple on practicable lines in China , where production already , according to some investigators , equals our own ( about a million bales entering the general market ) ; by developing it in his Own dominions , in Korea , Manchuria , Formosa . We already buy considerable textiles from the Japanese and sell them practically none . Competing ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivation or cotton manufacturing , except along some specialized lines , is something we can not do , without exceptional aid from nature or man 's mechanical genius . Edward Atkinson , Dixie 's greatest high prophet , declared many years ago that climatic and soil conditions made vast areas of South America highly fitted for profitable cotton culture . Brazil is proving this to be true by producing its own needs , with some to spare . THE FUTURE OF COTTON IN THE SOUTH One thing may save cotton lastingly to the South ? machinery . With a successful cotton-picker , the South could defy the world for many decades to come . Only with it , or by the importation of cheap labor , can it ultimately meet the labor factor which some day will enter and control the race for dominance in cotton production . The first seems beyond the inventor ; the latter , for reasons social , is beyond contemplation . You may ask : What of the future South , that land so romantically , so traditionally identified with cotton ? What of the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and irrigation will be turning the plateaus of Trans-Caucasia , the pampas of the Paraguay and Parana , the plains of Uganda and the wide sweeps of mysterious China into fields of blossoming white ? It is a picture more bizarre than threatening . As many have long believed , the South not only would have been better  | off in the past but would be in the future ? without cotton . But for cotton , Dixie 's splendid history would not be darkened by the last shadow of chattel slavery . There would have been no Civil War . That passing provincialism which held the South 's thought aloof from the world at large , and caused its people to be unjustly misunderstood , is due to cotton . And that poverty and ignorance , which as a Southerner I refer to in sadness and solely out of fidelity to truth , which renders the people in some remote communities of the South objects of pity such as we feel for few spots in the New or Old World , can be traced to cotton 's strange fondness for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be credited to it is a distinctive civilization ( modernized by the blood of brothers ) , the relics and memories of which will ever charm historians and romanticists ; and a foreign trade of for a new nation . Those blue months of early fall , 1914 , demonstrated more than was apparent . The Prussian bayonet had caused the South 's business structure to reel . The South stood in awe , dazed . Though famine dared put forth its fearful threat , the South did n't tremble or lose its nerve . For the South could have thrown every bale of cotton into the sea , burned every ginhouse , destroyed every cotton seed and interjected further planting of cotton , and still would have been in a better financial and commercial situation , aye by fifty times , than at the close of the Civil War . For the South has outgrown cotton . Relatively , cotton is in the minority . Though it still dominates Southern finance , being a product peculiarly financial , it no longer tyrannizes Southern commerce , except in a remotely banking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foodstuffs . The value of the South 's manufactures double it . Combine lumber , minerals , naval stores , tobacco , fruits , and a score of products in which the section is leading or might lead , and you have a commercial giant by which cotton would be a pigmy . Then remember that all these are " infant industries " ; that the industrial South is in its childhood ; that its natural wealth has hardly been  | " discovered , " much less massed for development ? and you find that cotton can be eliminated and leave a land rich in fact and in prospect . A suspicion of all this is creeping into the mind of the Southerner and is influencing his attitude toward the nation and the world . For ' a hundred and twenty years the mainspring of political and business opinion in the South was cotton . Unravel the often complicated texture of Southern sentiment and you find the binding thread was ever cotton . It is so no longer . Great Britain 's declaration of war on Germany was apparently the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Great Britain . The British embargo delayed as to cotton out of deference to Southern opinion but put into full effect in 1915 , cost the South hundreds of millions of dollars . There was some ground for the argument that ' the embargo was illegal . Still the South made no protest ? it really approved the move , and was glad to contribute its losses to the cause it now joins in openly espousing . Efforts to arouse sentiment there against the embargo , made by able men whose leadership is usually accepted , brought forth general condemnation . The South 's opinion rose above the interests of cotton . For the South at last is independent ? even of cotton , its king and former tyrant , though King Cotton now occupies his throne more majestically than ever before .  |
