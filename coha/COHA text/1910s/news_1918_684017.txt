txt Higher ore prices , advances in freights which affect the cost of assembling ore , coal and coke , limestone and other raw materials , together with the advance in steel labor wages that took place in April , increase the cost of manufacturing steel approximately $5 a ton on the average over the cost level of the first quarter of 1918 , according to the estimate of a prominent trade expert . This , he figures , will mean a 25%'reduction in profits of steel producers , varying somewhat with different concerns . Prices now obtaining for iron and steel products were fixed last September , when production costs were considerably below those of the first quarter of this year , and still lower their present costs , but the results of Friday 's conference in Washington prove that the authorities there are not inclined to make allowance for the changed cost conditions . So far as the big producer is concerned existing prices , even with the higher costs , allow him a substantial profit , though far less than he has been accustomed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is reason to believe that cost and receipts per ton-are-getting uncomfortably close , his margin of profit dwindling . In fact , it is learned some of the largest producers have had to help out the lesser and unintegrated concerns , sales of semi-finished material being made to them in some instances at prices below the established maximums . It was pointed out at the time that prices were first fixed that it was imperative that the levels decided on be sufficiently high to encourage the smaller manufacturer to produce to capacity , steel being probably the Government 's greatest war need . It was this consideration which led to the original establishment of levels that were decidedly profitable for the larger concerns , while only fairly so for the smaller ones . But if costs keep on advancing and prices do not gain commensurately it is plain that before long production will be discouraged .
