 | During the first half of the nineteenth century , before the discovery of gold in California , the South was the principal gold producing section of the United States . In 1799 a seventeen pound nugget was found on the Reed plantation in Cabarrus County , North Carolina ; in 1803 the same mine produced a twenty-eight pound nugget , probably the largest found in the eastern United States . North Carolina , in 1804 , was the only state from which gold production was reported . The gold production in Rutherford and Burke counties became of much importance during the next quarter century . In 1829 placer miners from the fields of Burke County began work in what is now White County , Georgia , and afterward went to Habersham and bumpkin counties , Georgia . The difficulty and inconvenience of transportation to the United States Mint at Philadelphia led to gold coinage by private mints in Georgia and North Carolina several years before the United States government provided branch mints at Charlotte , N. C. ( 1837 ) , and Dahlonega , Ga . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the federal government provided the ? , uth with facilities for assaying and coining gold . The first coinage of this type was done by Templeton Reid , in Georgia , in 1830 . He established his mint in bumpkin County , near the gold mines , and turned out $10 , $5 , and $2.50 gold coins . By weight one test of these coins at the United States Mint gave respectively 251 , 123.3 , and 60 grains . ' An assay made in 1842 , however , gave the weight of a $10 piece as 248 grains , 942-1000 fine , and value $10.06 . The value and stability of such issues are of prime importance , because on those two factors depend for the issuer the amount of business he can get and for the people using the coin the justice they are receiving . With respect to the stability of his issue ,  | Reid appears not to have achieved the desideratum , but , as one of the tests showed , he was probably not unfair to his customers . Just how long he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because all of the coins are dated 1830 . It is , however , known that he was doing business in California in 1849 . Only one year later , in 1831 , a better known and more prolific private mint was set up at Rutherfordton , North Carolina , by Christopher Bechtler . He was a German immigrant from the Grand Duchy of Baden where he had been a gun-maker and goldsmith . G. W. Featherstonbaugh in A Canoe Voyage Up the Minnay Sotor , published in London , 1847 , tells how he was impressed with Bechtler 's honesty in making his coins the same value as the coins of the United States . The mint was in the hands of Christopher Bechtler from 1831 to 1842 , and then it passed to his son Augustus . By that time , however , its usefulness had already been impaired by the establishment of the United States Mint at Charlotte . When Bechtler started coining , he issued $1 , $2.50 , and $5 gold pieces without date , and it was not until 1834 that the date appears on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date . From 1834 he had three weights for his money , depending on its fineness : 20 Carats ................. $5 to weigh 140 grains 21 Carats ................. $5 to weigh 134 grains 22 Carats ................. $5 to weigh 128 grains To designate these different degrees of fineness , in addition to indicating by numerals on the coin , he ordinarily used on the reverse of the 20 carat coins , " North Carolina gold , " of the 21 carat coins , " Carolina gold , " and of 22 carat coins , " Georgia gold . " This designation does not appear to have anything to do with the source of the gold , since it all probably came from the same place . He stamped on the coins turned out at his mint his name and place of business , the value , date ( after 1834 ) , fineness , and weight of the coins . One test of the coinage indicated an irregularity in the fineness amounting to a loss of about 272 per cent . Another test gave an average deficiency in weight from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over one-half of a grain , but variations in the fineness could have made the loss greater . Fortunately there is a definite and apparently reliable statement of the amount of money coined up to February , 1840 . During this period Bechtler states he coined $2,241,840.50 . In addition , he melted into bars 1,729,998 pennyweight , valued at $1,383,160.50 . The total bullion from the North Carolina mines from the discovery of gold there to December 31 , 1839 , is put at $10,000,000 ; so Bechtler handled approximately onethird of the total output . A record of the amount coined from 1840 on is not available , but indications point to the fact that it was probably not very much , because the establishment of the mint at Charlotte , only 80 miles distant , produced a drop from $770,329.50 ? August , 1836 , to May , 1838 to $194,560 May , 1838 , to February , 1840 . The younger Bechtler charged from two to two and a half per cent for coining the gold , and , if his father charged accordingly , the mint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A mint turning out such a considerable amount of money must have built up a wide circulation for its output . Hunt 's Merchant 's Magazine in 1844 said : " The community having a just confidence in the purity of the metal , much of it is carried by travellers , emigrants , traders and others , into Kentucky , Tennessee and elsewhere ? much of it is believed to be still extant among the farmers , not only in Tennessee and Kentucky , but North Carolina , laid up , with prudent foresight , for future use . " 3 The question of the justification of these enterprises is raised by John H. Landis , formerly superintendent of the mint at Philadelphia , when he says : " There can hardly have been any reason of necessity for either of these enterprises , since neither community was beyond the reach of assay offices where gold could have been disposed of . " 4 The justness of this observation is questionable . Merely because these mints were in the East , and the Philadelphia and New Orleans mints were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the hardship that would have been imposed upon the miners of this ore at a period when transportation was a matter of  | days over distances now covered in the same number of hours . That the private mints were serving an actual need is further indicated by the establishment of the United States mints at Dahlonega , Georgia , and Charlotte , North Carolina , in 1838 , limited to the coinage of gold . Moreover , the Director of the Mint , in his report for 1841 , said : " The coins thus fabricated are below the nominal value marked upon them ; yet they circulate freely at this value , and therefore it must be more advantageous to the miner to carry his bullion to the private than to the public mints . In California the same process which had been carried out earlier in Georgia and North Carolina was repeated on a much larger scale . Gold was discovered far from assay offices and government mints . Transportation was slow , uncertain , and expensive . The people needed money . Pressure was brought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow , and private mints sprang up as much to provide the people with what they demanded as to fill the coffers of their owners . They rendered a genuine service with varying degrees of honesty , and this time they had the wholesome influence of competition to keep them up to the mark . At first gold dust and nuggets , weighed and marked with the value of the contents , served for money . There was not a great need for small change because there was relative abundance of Mexican silver coins . To supply the need for gold coins made from the gold coming almost in streams from the river beds and hillsides , no less than twelve private mints were established . For the most part the issues were in denominations of $10 and $5 , ? a few $50 and $20 pieces were coined . The general style of these coins was the same . They carried the name of the issuer , the value , and some sort of a design , ? usually a bust of Liberty , the emblem of the eagle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the range in weight and size of the coins issued .  | The fluctuation in weight is due in part to the variation in fineness , but the value was not uniform as is shown by one mint test . The intrinsic value of the $10 and $5 coins showed a range of : The $9.977 gold $10 was issued by Moffat &; Co . An earlier test , made in 1849 , at the New Orleans Mint , showed practically the same results . Commenting on that test , the assayer said : " As . . . these coins appear to be made of California , gold , unchanged , except in melting , and being cast into ingots , we may expect the title to vary as much as that of the gold in different localities , the range of which is from 860 to 910 milliemes . Hence , no surprise should exist at a difference of title rendered in the same mint , or of titles as compared with those of other mints . " Absolutely , the amount of gold coined by these companies was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ output than Bechtler did of the North Carolina production . It was estimated that in June , 1852 , there was circulating in the form of gold dust , or California private coin , $20 for each of the 212,000 population , or a total of $4,240,000.9 For the whole period ending January 1 , 1854 , it was estimated that $260,000 , - 000 in gold had been produced . " More than $60,000,000 have been coined in this city San Francisco , but a large amount of it has been recoined at the United States Mints . The only private coining establishment now in operation here is that of Kellogg &; Richter , which is doing a very heavy business . " 10 The California coins bear the dates : 1849 to 1853 , and 1855 , - the greater number in 1849 and 1850 . A rather interesting feature of the coinage is the gold half and quarter dollars bearing dates ranging from 1852 to 1880.  | It is thought by some that these small pieces were not intended for circulation but to be distributed for souvenirs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundant supply of small change was available , seems to support this view . It is true , however , that because the $50 was the lowest ingot stamped at the United States assay office at San Francisco , established in 1851 , there came to be a shortage of small denomination money , and Mexican dollars sold at a premium , December , 1851 , of from one to two per cent . The banking houses charged at the same time a two per cent premium for small gold pieces of American coinage . This need may have been supplied in part by these small pieces , and the director of the mint in 1871 said that no doubt these coins were imposed on ignorant people as real money . Their use , in any event , was probably very limited . The response of the United States government to the demand for coinage facilities was first met by contracting with Moffat and Company , of San Francisco , to assay and coin gold pieces for the government . The smallest denomination so coined was to be $50 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same stamp . They were by law coins of the United States and full legal tender . Ingots over $200 in value might be stamped , but they were to be in the form of bars.12 This assay coinage did not help the currency situation much , because the issue was limited to pieces of $50 and over . The need was for a mint to turn out the regular denomination gold coins . The inconvenience and confusion caused by the tardiness in establishing such a mint is indicated by the following extract from the Alta California of San Francisco , August , 1851 : The present difficulties in the way of trade , consequent upon the issue of irresponsible coin , result naturally from the failure of Congress to provide us with a Mint ; in the absence of which these spurious imitations have flooded the channels of trade , until they have become water-logged , have sunk , and are now like snags , knocking out the bottom of Commerce , and business generally . The bankers , who especially aided in getting this coin in circulation , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage , have determined to decry it , and thus make another good per percentage , by purchasing it when the panic shall have de- pressed it below its real value . The merchants also have repudiated it . This movement of theirs would have been much better had they taken it long ago 13 In the same connection , Hunt 's Merchant 's Magazine says : " The want of a mint has cost the miners $18,000,000 , which has been the profit of speculators , through the neglect of the government to provide a mint accessible to all . " This failure of the government was remedied by the passing , July , 1852 , of the act establishing the San Francisco Mint . In addition to the private coinage of gold in California , less pretentious mints existed at various times in Oregon , Utah , Colorado , and Kansas . In 1842 the Orange Exchange Company , Oregon City , Oregon , put out some $10 and $5 gold pieces , sizes 17 and 14 , and by weight 262 and 129.5 grains , respectively.14 At one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be $4.82 . A rather interesting private gold issue is the so-called " Coinage of the Mormons , " struck in Utah in 1849 and in 1860 . The denominations coined included $20 , $10 , $5 , and $2.50 . The design of a $20 piece of 1849 is typical . On the obverse it bore the legend Holiness to the Lord , an ( ' an the reverse the letters the letters G. S. L. C. P. G.15 The $10 pieces ranged in value from $8.50 to $8.70 , and the value of the other coins was maintained in proportion.19 In 1860 and 1861 there were three concerns coining gold in Colorado17 in denominations of $10 , $5 , and $2.50 . This coinage was issued in considerable quantities and was current in the Far West . It was of a pale color , more highly alloyed by the natural silver in it than the United States gold coins , but this deficiency was made up in part by the increased weight.13 The $10 issues of Clark , Graber &; Co. , counting the silver in them , varied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $10 . The others did not test out so well.l9 A semi-freakish private gold coinage in half-dollar denomination was issued in 1871 at  | Leavenworth , Kansas . On the reverse it bore the inscription Half Dollar Cal. , probably in imitation of the bona fide California coinage of the same denomination . The weight of one specimen tested was 7.6 grains , 520-1000 fine , value 17 cents . The case was taken up by the authorities of the district under the act passed June 8 , 1864 , - the first act passed to prohibit the issue of coins by individuals , whether in imitation of the United States coins or not . This private coinage of gold , carried on at different periods in seven states and territories of the Union , seems an anomalous chapter in the history of our coinage . In 1851 the assayers reported that twenty-seven different kinds of gold coins , from fifteen private mints , had been received and assayed at the Philadelphia Mint . Ten years earlier , the director of the mint had expressed surprise that " the privilege of coining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government ; while that of coining gold and silver , though withheld from the states , is freely permitted to individuals , with the single restriction that they must not imitate the coinage established by law . " Equal surprise can not be expressed that the people patronized these mints when , in 1849 and early in 1850 , the minimum period between depositing the bullion and receiving the coin at the Philadelphia Mint was sixty days . Bullion deposited prior to December , 1849 , was paid out in the coined money the middle of the following February . Rather than wait on the mints , some gold shippers found it profitable at times to send the gold to England and sell bills of exchange against it . This situation had been materially bettered before the end of 1851 , and the usual time elapsing between the deposit of bullion and the beginning of the payment of the coins had been reduced to forty-eight hours .
