txt The London Times , in reference to the Morgan collection at the Victoria-Albert Museum , prints letters from President Read of the Society of Antiquaries and Fitz Henry , Morgan 's representative , which suggest Mr. Morgan 's reason for withdrawing the collection from England . It arises simply out of the financial policy of the British Government . Mr. Morgan , as we are reminded by President Read , who has known him intimately and frequently discussed this matter with him , is 75 Years old . Like a purdent man of business , he has been looking to the future , the inevitable future , and finds that if these costly things were still on deposit at South Kensington at the time of his death , his executors would have to pay estate duty upon them . So says Somerset House , whose verdict on such matters in point is final . It matters not that these things have been freely lent for the instruction and pleasure of the , English public for many years . If the owner dies while they are still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suppose the collection is worth a million sterling . The duty would be $750,000 , and that is a sum which even Mr. Morgan naturally is unwilling to hand over to the Chancellor of the Exchequer . He would prefer to spend it in his own way , probably in increasing his collections , which ultimately are to come to his own countrymen . WENT ABROAD TO ARRANGE . Mr. Morgan 's Trip Partly to Make Transportation Plans . The news brought by THE TIMES wireless dispatches from London yesterday that J. Pierpont Morgan , President of the Metropolitan Museum of Art of this Mee is to bring here the part of his famous collection that he has had on exhibition in London crystallizes what has for a long time been rumored . The rumor has now become a certainty , for it has been verified by . J. Pierpont Morgan , Jr. , and by Edward Robinson , Director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art , where the collection will be exhibited when they arrive . These are Mr. Morgan 's art treasures that have been for some years In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The time set for their arrival in this country is indefinitely stated to be " in the near future . " It was learned here yesterday that Mr. Morgan called on Collector William Loeb , Jr. , at the Custom House three months ago to consult him regarding the transfer of his famous collection . Mr. Morgan told the Collector that part of the collection had been made by his father , Junius Morgan , and most of it was more than 100 years old , and therefore free from duty . Collector Loeb , in order to expedite the transfer of the collection to this country , will send an Assistant Appraiser from New York to London to supervise the packing of it , and with Lorenzo Chance , confl. dental agent of the Treasury in London , see that the customs regulations are complied with . By this arrangement the whole collection will be conveyed straight from the pier on arrival here without any opening of packages . le It was also learned yesterday that one of the objects of Mr. Morgan 's trip to Europe was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be said , moreover , on authority . that the reason of the removal is not , as intimated in the dispatches , that Mr. Morgan was dissatisfied with the way in which the collection was displayed or the manner in which they were cared for , but because Mr. Morgan felt , as a patriotic American , that the place for the collection was the United States . Its transportation here before this time . however , has been impossible because of the prohibitive duties on art and art-craft treasures . It may be that Mr. Morgan so far appreciates the kindness which the South Kensington Museum authorities have shown in their care of the collections that he may not remove them all at once , but will arrange for their transportation here gradually . Remarkable Treasure &; Mr. Morgan has no catalogue of these collections in this city at present . They include , : n a general way , his collection of bronzes of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries , and his enamels of the twelfth century . They also number among them his collection of Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some of his Mpestries , and his collection of stained glass , as well as his collection of old jewels , pendants , and so forth , and a part of his collection Of watches . Their owner had not stated what disposition he will make of the collections when they reach this country or where th , y will be displayed publicly , if at all . The talk of Mr , Morgan 's famous European collections being brought to this Country has been going on for years . Ten years ago , when the duties on works of art coming into the United States were so heavy , it was said that it would cost at least $3,000,000 to get them into this country , and that was thought a conservative estimate . Mr. Morgan at that time was fighting the duties on art works , but members of his family said that it vas on principle , not because he had any des of bringing his own collections to emerica . Three years ago Mr. Morgan 's laughter , Mrs. William Pierson Hamil , - on talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My father has been very active in trying . to have the duty taken ' off works of art , but I do not really think that he will brine any of the wonderful collections thet he has in London to this country You see , he began certain col ' lections on the other side of the water and I think he will feel that he wishes to keep them there . " Last Fall , however , when Mr. Morgan 's famous " Jewel Collection " wee shown in the Victoria and Albert Museum , it was rumored in England that the exhibition was really a farewell view . Of all of Mr. Morgan 's treasures in the Victoria and Albert Museum this is the best known . Mr. Robinson of the Metropolitan Museum , when asked yesterday what the collections were which Mr. Morgan had at the London Museum and would bring to this country , replied : I do not know what Mr. Morgan has in the Museum . It would be difficult to tell . Mr. Morgan changes his collectionsl at different times . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those making loans are not given if their collections are included . In the magnificent catalogues of Mr. Morgan 's collection which are in the Metropolitan  --  Museum Library , with the exception of that of the jewel collection . it is not stated where they are placed . There Is probably no one who could state offhand what has been loaned to the London Museum . With the jewel collection will be brought Into this country more wonderful histories than is to be found in any other collection extant . Included in it are rock crystals and wood carving , of wilich Mr. Morgan has the most famous private collection in the world . The rock crystals were the special pride of Kings and only the most wealthy could possess them . Many pieces in the collection were stolen and hidden away for hundreds of years . One piece was burled with ' its owner for a century , lost for anothercentury , came to light in an auction , where it was bought by a dealer , and so reached Mr. Morgan . This was the famous golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great connoisseur . It is to be seen in one of his portraits in Dresden . From him it went to Henry of Gretherod , with whom it was buried in 1614 . After 100 years it was taken from the tomb and put in the green vaults for safety . The Saxons retnoved their treasures from the vaults for fear of the French soldiers , but the chain was never returned until it appeared at tha auction . Mliberti , - who made the famous doors of the baptistry at Florence , made a famous pendant of wrought gold and enamel , which belonged to ? osimoe Medici . A wonderful rock . crystal bowl in the collection belonged - to Queen Christina of Sweden , 1626-1689 , who was a better connoissuer of art than Queen . Becoming a . Roman Catholic , she was ? disowned by her own people , and spent the last twenty years of her life in Rome . Among the wood carving is a marvelousl rosary bead , 21/4 , by 23fi inches . This opens on a. hinge like a book and shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . of the cross and in the other the scene of the crucifixion , with the cross and a surrounding crowd . Inscriptions are carved on the rims of the two halves . An amber cup which be longed . to an Italian Cardinal . and was in the Farnese collection , has a gold enameled stem . There are- many wonderful reliquaries , containing bones of the , saints and pieces of the true cross . Among - Mr . Morgan 's pictures abroad is the famous once stolen Gainsborough , the " Duchess of Devonshire , " which he hail loaned to the National Gallery , anclj Raphael 's " Madonna of St. Anthony of Padua . " He has the Fragonard panels . which cost $1,000,000 , Rubens 's " Grand Duke , " one of the finest Hobemas , and rare Dutch , Italian , Flemish , French . and English masters . He has old English silver , old furniture , single pieces of which cost $350,000 , and the Mazarin tapestries , which cost , $500,000 . Regarding the statement that Mr. Mcrgan felt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been fairly treated , T. P. Morgan , Jr. , said yesterday : " The report that Mr. Morgan is bringing over a large part of his collections to this side is quite true , but the statement in The London Times that it was being done because of dissatisfaction with the manner in which the collections have been treated , or with any resentment against the authorities in England , was entirely incorrect . Mr. Morgan is perfectly satisfied with the care and attention which the English museums have given his collections , but very naturally has for a long time desired to have his collections in America . " Edward Robinson , Secetary of the Metropolitan Museum , said : It is quite true that Mr. Morgan intends to send some part of his London collections to New York in the near future . I am surprised at reading the reasons for this action which are given in the account , quoted from The London Times . I have never heard him express discontentment with the manner in which his things are exhibited in the Victoria and Albert Museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been his intention that America should ultimately reap the benefit of his great collection . " Most of the objects , which he has lent to the Victoria and Albert Museum , have been there a considerable number of years , and probably he thinks It is time for America to have its turn . I understand that what lie now sends to this country will come to the Metropolitan Museum , probably as a loan , like so many other valuable works of art which he has already deposited here , though on this subject he has given me no direct intimation . Whatever comes from his London collections will be exhibited in the new extension of the Museum at the northern end of the Fifth Avenue front , which will not be ready for occupancy for another year , as the contract for the completion of the interior has only just been awarded . In the meantime these things will be stored in the Museum in accordance with his wishes . "                  @ @ @
