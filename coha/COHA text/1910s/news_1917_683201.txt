And I do further proclaim and give notice to all persons subject to registration in the several States and in the District of Columbia in . accordance with the above law , that the time and place of such , be between 7 A.

In the territories of Alaska , Hawaii , and Porto Rico a day for registration will be named in a later proclamation , nit I do charge those who through sickness shall be unable to present themselves for registration that they apply on or before the day of registration to the County Clerk of the County where they may be for instructions as to how they may be registered by agent .

In case such persons as , through sickness or absence , may be unable to present themselves personally for registration shall be sojourning in cities of over 30,000 population , they shall apply to the City Clerk of the city wherein they may be sojourning rather than to the Clerk of the County . The Clerks of counties and of cities of over 30,000 population in which numerous applications from the sick and from nonresidents are expected are authorized to establish such . agencies and to employ and deputize such clerical force as may be necessary to accommodate these applications . Miir Power against which we are arrayed has - , 111 sought to impose its will upon the world by force . To this end it has increased armament until it has changed the face of war . In the sense in which we have been wont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this struggle , there are entire nations armed . Thus , the men who remain to till the soil and man the factories are no less a part of the army that is France than the men beneath the battle flags . It must be so with us . It is not an army that we must shape and train for war ; it is a nation . To ? this end our people must draw close in one compact front ? against a common foe . ' But this can not be if each man pursues a private purpose . All must pursue one purpose . The nation needs all men ; but it needs each man , not in the field that will most pleasure him , but in the endeavor that will best serve the common good . Thus , though a sharpshooter pleases to operate a trip-hammer for the forging of great guns and an expert machinist desires to march with the flag , the nation is being served only when the sharpshooter marches and the machinist remains at his levers . The whole nation must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part for which he is best fitted . To this end , Congress hasprovided that the nation shall be organized for war by selection ; that each man shall be classified for service in the place to which it shall best serve the general good to call him . The significance of this can not be overstated . It is a new thing in our history and a landmark in our progress . It is a new manner of accepting and vitalizing our duty to give ourselves with thoughtful devotion to the common purpose of us all . It is in no sense a conscription of the unwilling ; it is , rather , selection from a nation which has volunteered in mass . It is no more a. choosing of those who shall march with the colors than it is a selection of those who shall serve an equally necessary and devoted purpose in the industries that lie behind the battle line . The day here named is the time upon which all shall present themselves for assignment to their tasks . It is for that reason destined to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . It is nothing less than the day upon which the manhood of the country shall step forward in one solid rank in defense of the ideals to which this nation is consecrated . It is important to those ideals no less than to the pride of this generation in manifesting its devotion to them , that there be no gaps in the ranks . It is essential that the day be approached in thoughtful apprehension of its significance , and that we accord to it the honor and the meaning that it deserves . Our industrial need prescribes that it be not made a technical holiday , but the stern sacrifice that is before us urges that it be carried in all our hearts as a great day of patriotic devotion and obligation , when the duty shall lie upon every man , whether he is himself to be registered or not , to see to it that the name of every male person of the designated ages is written on these lists of honor . itt- Wilms ** I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ** it the , City of Washington this 18th day of May in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and seventeen , - ? nd of the independence of the United States of America the one hundred and forty-first.
