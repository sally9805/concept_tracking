 | I HAVE come to speak to you today upon the most vital problem which has confronted the people of America since the birth of the Republic . I shall make no preface and no exordium . There are times when , in the consideration of movements affecting human progress , rhetoric has no place . This is one of those times . We are at grips with the world and with ourselves . Not incidentals but fundamentals demand the gravest attention of you men who are about to go forth into the world charged with the solemn obligation to take from the hands of your predecessors and bear onward and upward the torch of human liberty . I congratulate you upon being young and virile . I congratulate you upon your acquisition , through study and discipline , of the power to reason . I congratulate you upon the highmindedness and broadmindedness which germinate in the life of the modern university . I congratulate you most of all ? and this I speak from the bottom of my heart ? upon being Americans . I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith in your country , and that you love your country . For this reason , in all sincerity and without the slightest trepidation , I congratulate you upon the assumption of exceptional responsibilities to God and man . Never before in the history of the Republic , not even  | in the dark days preceding the Civil War , has so deep an obligation been thrust so sharply and so unexpectedly upon an untried generation . Never before , I hope and pray , has such a generation been better equipped mentally , morally , and spiritually for the meeting and mastering with understanding , courage , and faith the overpowering issue which presses irresistibly for immediate solution . The question is not whether America has failed . We all know that she has not . We behold on all sides in the unparalleled prosperity , the recognized virtues , and the modest chivalry of her sons and daughters , indisputable evidences of her unexampled triumph . The past is secure . The present is as satisfying as could be expected in a time of universal turbulence . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . There is no change in the mission of America to serve mankind . The only question is whether a change in method is essential to the complete fulfillment of what has already been accomplished . The farsighted builders of our national independence had such a contingency in mind when they proposed the great Declaration which still lives as the spring from which have flown our manifold blessings . Life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness were pronounced inherent rights , but no more so than the right of the people to alter or abolish any form of government destructive of those ends . " Prudence , indeed , " it was said , " will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes ; and accordingly all experience hath shown , that mankind are more disposed to suffer , while evils are sufferable , than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed . But when a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the same object , evinces a design to reduce them under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their duty , to throw off such Government , and to provide new Guards for their future security . " The direct reference , of course , was to the subjection of the Colonies by the mother country , but the principle thus enunciated applies with equal force to the present situation . Has the time come when , conformably to this fundamental truth , our form of government must be changed if we would consummate the great purposes to  | which the young Republic was dedicated ? That is what we are asked to do in the name and for the sake of humanity . Upon that point there rests not a shadow of doubt . No sophistries can disguise the fact that any permanent engagement with any other Power involves to some degree surrender of the absolute independence which for nearly one hundred and fifty years has been the keystone of the Republic . It follows then inevitably that alliances such as are contemplated by the proposed League of Nations involve a change , however great or small , in the form of our Government . It is equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of our sovereignty to representatives of other Powers , comprising an autocracy of governments , not of peoples , tends , in the language of the great declaration , " to reduce the people under that absolute despotism " which it is their duty to reject " for their future security . " These statements have not been and can not be challenged successfully . That they are disputed I am well aware , but assertion is not argument , and mere didactics , however eloquent , persuasive and appealing , can not withstand manifest and irresistible facts . I shall not attempt to analyze in detail the proposed Covenant . It is not necessary to do so . Surely none can question that any engagement committing the United States to cooperate with certain Powers in waging war upon certain other Powers under any circumstances for any purpose involves permanent entangling alliances which hitherto have been avoided conformably to the adjurations of the Fathers . So much at least is plain and unescapable . But it is maintained that this is not a vital concession because our freedom of action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unimpaired . Is this the fact ? The first and chief prerogatives of sovereignty , it is axiomatic , embrace absolute and unqualified rights to make war or peace at will . Now Article X of the Covenant reads as follows : " The members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all members of the League . " No language could be more explicit , no pledge more definite . I shall not dwell upon the consequences to lib- erty-seeking peoples if such a compact of controlling Powers had existed in the past . They are only too apparent . France could not have come to the aid of the thirteen colonies and neither in 1782 nor since could America have achieved her independence . Your and my United States could never have come into being . True , it may be argued that our people would have fared as well , if not better , if they had continued to live under British dominion , but I can not deem it an exaggeration to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any rate until now ; and I doubt if it is today , despite the fact ? and it is a fact ? that if the proposed League shall become effective America will presently revert in all essentials of government to her former position as a British colony . Cuba , of course , could not have been freed because , under the terms of the Covenant , the United States , in going to her assistance , would have been held to have declared war upon the entire League . Take a case immediately in point . One may or may not sympathize with Ireland 's ambition to achieve independence , but it is difficult to conceive of any lover of freedom contemplating with gratification her perpetual enchainment by England with the acquiescence and , if need should arise , the forceful assistance of the United States . True it is , as claimed , that the League leaves to each member the privilege of dealing with internal revolts as it may see fit , but this mere fact , taken in conjunction with Ireland 's probable inability to achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercy of England . This , according to the advocates of the League , including our Peace Commission in Paris , is regarded as eminently right and proper and the only way , indeed , in which the associate members can maintain the existing " territorial integrity " of one another . But , helpless though the people of Ireland are now , confronted upon all sides by English bayonets , the time may come when they will be able to set up a government of their own , as our forefathers did , and even to attack England . That would make for " external aggression " and Great Britain would have the right to call upon the United States to join in her war against Ireland . And the United States would be bound to respond .  | Upon this point and , strange as it may seem , upon this point alone , we have the authoritative judgment of our own official representative . On May 10 the President cabled to his secretary for publication the following message : " Happily there is no mystery or privacy about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised to propose to the Senate a supplement in which we shall agree , subject to the approval of the council of the League of Nations , to come immediately to the assistance of France in case of unprovoked attack by Germany , thus merely hastening the action to which we . should be bound by the Covenant of the League of Nations . " The precise terms of the agreement under which the President has pledged , so far as he is empowered to pledge , the United States to go immediately to the assistance of France in the contingency noted have not yet been revealed , and consequently are not susceptible of enlightened consideration . But his declaration that the commitment conforms to and merely hastens " the action to which we should be bound by the Covenant of the League , " is highly significant as the first clear definition we have yet had of the specific obligations of our Government as a qualified member . It is , in a word and unequivocally , to go immediately to the assistance of another member confronted by external aggression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only possible unprovoked assault by Germany within a certain period of time it would not inevitably trench upon our traditional aloofness from permanent alliances , although for other reasons , such as arise , for example , in determining whether an attack is provoked or otherwise , it is surely novel and necessarily hazardous . With that particular and so far in detail unrevealed promise , however , we need not now concern ourselves . The essential feature of the President 's declaration is that the pledge of immediate assistance in force is neither confined to France nor limited in time , but is made in common to all members of the League and in perpetuity . Although released for public inspection inferentially and perhaps inadvertently , it is none the less conclusive and , I may add , disconcerting , since the magnitude of the responsibility thus assumed can hardly be measured . Indeed , the mere suggestion that the United States might be induced , under any circumstances , to hold its armies and navies subject to  | the call of any one of thirty nations , scattered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems inconceivable . And yet , under the President 's own admission , it is so written and so agreed in the Covenant . Mr. Taft , to his credit be it said , proposed a plain , straightforward amendment providing that any American state or states " may protect the integrity of any American territory and the sovereignty of the government whose territory it is , whether a member of the League or not , and may , in the interest of American peace , object to and prevent the further transfer of American territory or sovereignty to any European or non-American power . " This , as Mr. Taft truly says in his memorandum , is " the Monroe Doctrine pure and simple . " Mr. Wilson rejected it absolutely in both form and substance . He substituted in its stead the following amazing declaration : " Nothing in this covenant shall be deemed to affect the validity of international engagements such as treaties of arbitration or regional understandings like the Monroe Doctrine for securing the maintenance of peace . " And in his speech presenting the Covenant he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new . " That is all he could find to say of this definite and conclusive renunciation of our most cherished National policy , ? for that is what it is and has been for more than a hundred years . The Monroe Doctrine is not an " international engagement , " it is not a " treaty of arbitration " and it is not a " regional understanding . " Even if it were , this curiously worded phrase recognizes the validity , not of the Monroe Doctrine itself , but only of " engagements , " " treaties " and " understandings " which resemble it . So far from reserving for our own determination this national policy , the Covenant tosses it into the air and vests the power of decision of any dispute over it in the " other Powers " comprising the League . " Should any dispute ever arise between the American and European Powers , the League is there to settle it . " Those are the exact words of the official British manifesto issued within forty-eight hours after publication of the Covenant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the President or by any other person connected with the so-called American delegation . And  | silence gives consent . Both inferentially and practically the United States , in so far as Mr. Wilson can commit the United States , has accepted this open declaration of the British Government , and that acceptance , once ratified by the Senate , would be as binding as an explicit abandonment of the whole principle . The pretense that internationalizing the Doctrine would strengthen it is palpably ridiculous . In the very nature of the case , to admit European nations to participation in the interpretation and application of the Monroe Doctrine would be to destroy its value ; since its fundamental principle is that of separation from just such European meddling . It would be as rational to say that " all men are created equal " from our original Declaration of Independence is " an international engagement " or that our proclamation of the colonies as " free and independent states " is a " treaty of arbitration " or that our very Constitution is a " regional understanding . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic and requires , no more than they required , interpretation from foreign sources . We need not hark back to the past for its true meaning . Grover Cleveland put it plainly when he directed Secretary Olney to notify the world that " today the United States is practically sovereign on this continent , and its fiat is law upon which it confines its interposition . " Theodore Roosevelt , in the last article written before his death , warned us , his countrymen , that we are " in honor bound to keep ourselves so prepared that the Monroe Doctrine shall be accepted as immutable international law . " And as late as January 6 , 1916 , whatever may be his views today , President Wilson declared to the Pan-American Congress : " The Monroe Doctrine was proclaimed by the United States on her own authority . It has always been maintained , and always will be maintained , upon her own responsibility . " There you have it , in the graphic words of Hosea Biglow , " plain and flat . " And yet this Covenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it " as it " always has been maintained upon her own responsibility . " On the contrary it transfers the power of both interpretation and execution to the International Council and , if any question respecting its application shall arise ,  | in the words of the official British pronouncement , " the League is there to settle it . " And France concurs with England . " It seems to me monumentally paradoxical and a trifle infantile , " says M. Lausanne , the chief spokesman for M. Clemenceau , " to pretend the contrary . " When the Executive Council of the League of Nations fixes the reasonable limits of the armament of Peru ' ; when it shall demand information concerning the naval programme of Brazil ( Article VII . of the covenant ) ; when it shall tell Argentina what shall be the measure of the contribution to the armed forces to protect the signatures of the social covenant ' ( Article XVI. ) ; when it shall demand the immediate registration of the treaty between the United States and Canada at the seat of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the destinies of America . " And when the American States shall be obliged to take a hand in every war or menace of war in Europe ( Article XI. ) , they will necessarily fall afoul of the fundamental principle laid down by Monroe . . . . " If the League takes in the world then Europe must mix in the affairs of America ; if only Europe is included then America will violate of necessity her own doctrine by intermixing in the affairs of Europe . " Notwithstanding these explicit and forceful expressions of understanding from France and England and notwithstanding the golden silence of the President himself at this time when clearly he must speak or forever hereafter hold his peace , Mr. Taft with characteristic grace and complacency , in tolerant disregard of the rejection of his own amendment , makes the astounding statement that the Monroe Doctrine is fully safeguarded by the Covenant . I denounce and oppose the ratification of this Covenant for the following reasons which I defy anybody to challenge successfully : Because , as I have shown , it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great tradition enunciated by Washington and reiterated by every President and statesman from the inception of the Republic to and including the time of Roosevelt . This fact is undeniable and is admitted . Because , as I have shown , it does vitiate our inde- pendence and impair our sovereignty . Thomas Jefferson accurately and graphically defined independence as implying " full power to levy war , conclude peace , establish commerce , and do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do . " Sovereignty is no less correctly defined by a later authority in these words : " A state to possess full nationality must have complete external sovereignty and complete internal sovereignty exclusively within itself , that is , possessed by its sovereign . If it lacks either , it falls short of a perfect national character . . . . There can be no actual independence of a state unless the real sovereignty is held within the state . " That is the definition of our present Secretary of State , Robert Lansing . No argument is needed to prove that full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be maintained under the agreements prescribed by this Covenant . That fact also is admitted . The further statement is made that other Powers do likewise , but that is a palliation , not a reason , for the sacrifice of America . Because so radical a departure from an established system violates the first principle of a democracy that no change shall be made in either the form or the control of its government unless and until it has been approved by the people themselves . " If , " said Abraham Lincoln in his first inaugural , " there be any object to hurry any of you in hot haste to a step which you would never take deliberately , that object will be frustrated by taking time , but no good object can be frustrated by taking time . " I insist that no hasty conception of any one mind , be that mind ever so sagacious , should be fastened upon this nation in direct contravention of all teachings and practices of the past until it has received the approval of the people . President Lowell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that President Wilson never heard of the plan whose adoption he now demands until 1915 . I deny that , in reason , any man , overwhelmed in the meantime by the conduct of a great war , could formulate in detail a project of such magnitude with any certainty or probability of its rightness , of its wisdom , or of its success . I denounce the attempt to impose it upon our country by defiantly intertwining it in a mere treaty of peace as a crime against the Republic . Only its complete separation can give to the people ample opportunity for analysis and discussion  | and thus enable them to exercise their own mature judgment . And that is all I ask , readily conceding that , ever as has been , the voice of the people in this democracy ever shall be as the voice of God . Because no nation , however well fitted by experience and equipped with statesmanlike vision is competent to become the ruler of the world . That is what Great Britain would be under this Covenant . Do you doubt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of delegates : Six to one as compared with the United States . Consider secondly her overwhelming influence , as contrasted with that of this country , upon the scores of smaller European , Asiatic , and African states , each of which would exercise in that body a voting power equal to our own . Consider further , in respect to the proposed council , her separate offensive and defensive alliance with Japan , which she refuses to abrogate . Consider the authority which she would continue to wield over France and Italy by virtue of their utter dependence upon her for their very existence . Consider finally that , by her own peremptory insistence and our pusillanimous concession after futile protest , she would be intrenched for all time in her present control of the seven seas . Talk about disarmament ! Does Great Britain propose to dismantle her fleet ? The mere suggestion evokes only righteous indignation from the English people and derisive scorn from English statesmen . She will reduce it , yes , to save expense , but not one ship beyond the point where her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equal or superior of any two or three navies of other Powers combined . Reduction of armies she would welcome , and why not , since thereby her superiority upon the seas would be magnified correspondingly . Not only , moreover , would she welcome it , but in this Covenant , with our acquiescence , she has provided for it . The assertion that the United States may accept or reject the recommendations of the council respecting the limitation in size of its army is correct , but that is only at the beginning . What of the continuing situation to follow ? Having once determined the size of its army in cooperation with other Powers , conformably to an avowed purpose of a common reduction , the United States agrees that , whatever unforeseen needs may arise for the preservation  | of its territory or for the protection of its citizens , it will abide absolutely by that limitation , and it can not thereafter increase its forces for any purpose except with the consent of the international council . Much stress has been placed upon the provision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This provision has been heralded as a complete safeguard for and a great concession to the United States . Observe how it would work in this instance . Great Britain alone , without the cooperation of a single one of her allies or friends , would possess the absolute veto power upon a proposal of this or any other nation to increase its land forces , however dire the need , for any purpose . Is it not clear that such an arrangement would constitute the mistress of the seas the mistress of the world ? Is that what Washington fought for ? Is that what the men at Valley Forge suffered and died for ? Is that what the brave lads whose heroism has just been celebrated in Flanders ' Field made their supreme sacrifice for ? I render full acknowledgment of the magnificent service rendered to civilization by Great Britain during the past few years . I admit frankly and gratefully that , but for the superiority of her fleet , our criminal unpreparedness would have left our own fair land at the complete mercy of a ruthless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope , will you , consent to weld together the chains of dependence and subjection which our forefathers broke one hundred and fifty years ago and commit the destiny of our free Republic to the keeping of the domineering nation which we then defeated , or of any other Power upon the face of the earth . Because this is not a league to achieve universal peace but an unholy alliance of a few powerful nations , themselves dominated by a single Power , to enforce obedience and submission upon small and helpless peoples by threatening or waging irresistible war . An autocracy such as this proposed has never been known and has never been attempted but once . I do not need to recall to your minds the time when the monarchies of Europe engaged in a precisely similar undertaking . I do not need to instance the coincidence that they too acclaimed their alliance as holy when it was unholy , but I do ask you to remember that it was this young but intrepid Republic that smashed  | that infamous combination and clinched its triumph by declaring a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western Hemisphere . Our fathers condemned that alliance and established the Monroe Doctrine , and in so doing made the largest contribution to the divine cause of human freedom in the history of the world . Are we , their sons , now to vitiate all the . beneficent consequences of what they did then by establishing an equally vicious alliance and by crucifying the very doctrine whose promulgation wrought the downfall of that iniquitous oligarchy and whose continuing effects are still seen in the crashing of thrones ? I beg of you young men to reflect upon these things and to cherish the thought that just as Englishmen , Frenchmen , . and Italians rightfully glory in the achievements of their respective countries , you have no cause to bow your head in shame as Americans , unafraid and never too proud or too timorous to fight for the country which is your priceless heritage from those dauntless ancestors who cared not for life if unaccompanied by liberty . Because the greatest asset and chief reliance of humanity itself lie not in a conglomeration of far-flung states , kingdoms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ united in an imperishable independent Republic . Have we not proved that to the millions who have sought and found refuge , peace , prosperity and happy homes within our borders ? Could the last and greatest of battles for civilization have been won but for the irresistible power developed under our free institutions and brought finally , though laggardly , into action ? Did not we free Cuba and Porto Rico and the Philippines ? Who if not ourselves have kept all South America immune to aggression for a hundred years ? Where , if not to America , have people struggling to win their freedom been able to look with confidence for sympathy and kindness ? Where , I should say , until recently when , as a first fruit of the new order , our President coldly notified the inhabitants of Egypt that they would better continue under a foreign yoke ? A new definition , is not that , of " self-determination " ? I do not question the sincerity , nor perhaps should I doubt the validity of that opinion , but I do deny absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private , pedagogue or President , to assert , as Mr. Wilson asserted ,  | that he voiced the judgment not of himself alone , but of the American people . Is that a fair example of what we are to expect under the League ? Is it for that sort of thing that , in the words of the President , we stand " ready to make the supreme sacrifice and throw in our fortunes with the fortunes of men everywhere ? " What is the " supreme sacrifice ? " It is a term well understood . We know what it means . Upon the battlefield it is death , ? death of the individual . And here it is the same , ? death , death of the nation . I care not what specious pleas may be put forth in the name of pacifism or humanity , the moment , which pray God may never come , the moment we enter into this infamous compact , craftily constructed by those who have not always been our friends , that moment we sound the knell not only of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the world whose eyes still search the skies for the star of freedom , and whose hearts are sick with longing for the right pronounced by us from God which is as much theirs as ours . Because this is a Covenant , not for the preservation of peace , but for the protection of power ; not for the establishment of justice under the law , but for the enforcement of decrees under arbitrary rule . They say we offer nothing in its stead . That is not true . Chief among the proposals of Mr. Root was the creation of a great Court of Arbitration whose powers should be carefully defined in a new code of international law such as does not now exist , and whose judgments all nations should agree not only to accept but to enforce . There lies the true solution of all world problems , involving no sacrifice of sovereignty , eliminating all possibility of oppression and wrongdoing and guaranteeing to all peoples a fair hearing , a just determination and an inflexible enforcement of righteous judgment . That way and that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jurist and statesman , and the way of the autocrat and schoolmaster was substituted . Because it destroys the powerful incentive for individual achievement and human progress of National feeling . " There are , in short , " as Daniel Webster said of that other alliance , " no longer to be nations ; there is to be an end of all patriotism . " That clearly is what the President had in mind when he declared in his peculiar phrasing to  | the French Academy that " the old enterprise of national law is played out . " The new enterprise of arbitrary international power over all is to supersede it . That is the thought conveyed . And the thought is confirmed by every word and act of our Peace Commission . Englishmen have spoken loudly and effectively for England , Frenchmen for France , Italians for Italy , Japanese for Japan , but not once in the entire six months has a voice been raised for America . The President of the United States , elected by the people of the United States , to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his obligation as prescribed by his oath of office to " men everywhere . " Simultaneously he assumed a new and almost startling right of action when he appended this remarkable signature to the Treaty itself : " Honorable Woodrow Wilson , President of the United States , acting in his own name and by his own proper authority . " However this be regarded , whether as an unconscious assumption of divine authority as by the kings of old or as a mere symptom of developed egomania , its strangeness as the self-designation of a servant of a democracy is only too apparent . Nothing could evidence more significantly the personal conviction that nationality is indeed played out . But is it true ? Was George Washington in the wrong when he wrote to Patrick Henry : " My ardent desire is , and my aim has been as far as depended upon the executive department , to comply strictly with all our engagements , foreign and domestic ; but to keep the United States free from political connection , with every other country , to see them independent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , I want an American character , that the Powers of Europe may be convinced that we act for ourselves , and not for others . This , in my judgment , is the only way to be respected abroad and happy at home ; and not , by becoming partisans of Great Britain or France , create dissensions , disturb the public tranquillity , and destroy , perhaps forever , the cement which binds the Union . " Or when after leaving the Presidency he expressed in a letter to a friend , the hope that all would turn out well- " If our citizens would advocate their own cause instead of that of any other nation under the sun ; that is , if  | instead of being Frenchmen or Englishmen in politics they would be Americans , indignant at every attempt of either or any other powers to establish an influence in our councils or presume to sow the seeds of discord or disunion among us . " Obviously a sharper antithesis between the policy then advised and the policy now advocated could not be imagined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinct was no less sure when he wrote to Thomas Pinck-ney : " It remains to be seen whether our country will stand upon independent ground , or be directed in its political concerns by any other nation . Time will show who are its true friends , or , what is synonymous , who are true Americans . " Time is showing the true colors of all leaders ? statesmen and patriots , demagogues and self-seekers alike . Of the attitude of one successor of Washington who recently passed away at least there can be no question . " We must feel in the very marrow of our being , " were among the last words of Theodore Roosevelt , " that our loyalty is due only to America , and that it is not diluted by loyalty for any other nation or all other nations on the face of the earth . Only thus shall we fit ourselves really to serve other nations , to refuse ourselves to wrong them , and to refuse to let them do wrong or suffer wrong . " Can you wonder that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own Chancellor , one of the foremost advocates of the League propounded this shocking inquiry : " Was it the Power called God , working through laws that go wider and deeper than our imaginations can , or was it chance that , while the trial of the experiment was under discussion , removed to higher spheres , we trust , the one man most likely and most able to obstruct it ? " This ghoul-like chortling at the death of Theodore Roosevelt is extreme , I admit , but it is none the less typical . Daily those of us who deplore and dread what we honestly regard as a betrayal of our country , are subjected to like insults . Our motives are pronounced unworthy ? partisan , personal and base . Our " pigmy minds " are " loathed " by our President . Our Senators are derided by our former President as men whom he would not trust around a corner . We all are ignorant , narrow and , most terrifying of  | all , little Americans . But in the midst of this virulence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two words which are never mentioned . One is Patriot . The other is American . They are taboo in the lexicon of the disciples of Humanity . They too are played out and so cast aside . It is fitting , it is logical , it is right that this should be so ? that persons engaged wittingly or unwittingly in scuttling their country should tacitly regard appropriation of those titles as a profanation . Do I speak harshly ? Not unless the truth is harsh . And whatever of blame there is must rest upon those who abjure calmness and reason and compel the fighting of the devil with fire . For it is a fight , a fight to the limit of resources and endurance to the time when the American people shall be permitted to decide whether they wish to be or are being deprived of their God-given liberties . It is that great contest which I ask you to join , that sacred cause which I beg you to uphold with all your might and main as you go forth into the world . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for free governments of free peoples against autocratic rule over the many who are weak by the few who are strong , you stand with us . If you are for individualism and nationalism in preference to socialism and internationalism , you are on our side . If you are for justice under the law rather than for power sustained by boycotts and bayonets your minds meet ours . If you are for America first and always as the chief salvation of oppressed human beings anywhere on earth , you will clasp our hands with yours and raise your eyes in single-hearted devotion to the one banner in the whole world which gleams a star for every State and a State for every star . The issue is clear . The line is drawn . Recall Memorial Day ! Two emotions were voiced , two tributes were paid to the flower of American youth who sleep in Flanders fields . One by the Commander-in-Chief who spoke these words : " These men have given their lives in order to secure the freedom of mankind . . . . The thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their counsels conceive it , is the great instrument which we have just erected in the League of Nations . "  | The other by the Field Commander , under whom they fought and died , who said : " The principles which our forefathers fought to establish , the heroic dead who lie here fought to maintain . . . . As they went to battle they were united with a holy inspiration , realizing their mighty task and their obligations to their country . Strengthened by the test of war , and with an abiding faith in the Almighty , let us be steadfast in upholding the integrity of our traditions as a guide to future generations at home and a beacon to all . The glory of our independence must remain the leaven and our flag the emblem of all that freemen love and cherish . " The words of Wilson and the words of Pershing ! Which was right ? Which was wrong ? What thought those dauntless sons of America who bore into battle the strength and courage of their ancestors ? Not long ago I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had visions of ideals in his dreams during the great battle . He looked at me dazed for an instant , then flushed to the roots of his hair and replied evenly , " I fought for my country and my flag , sir . " His flag ! His flag and ours ? the first we ever saw and , pray God , it may be the last and only one upon which our fading eyes shall rest . But a new banner has appeared . It blows in the breezes off the shores of England . It has been seen in the harbor of New York in the shadow of the great statue . It is the new international flag . It is simple and quite beautiful ? a blue stripe between two white stripes . What they symbolize I do not know . This flag over my head was adopted by the Continental Congress in 1777 , one hundred and forty-two years ago . The first one was the product of the nimble fingers of that sturdy little patriot , Betsy Ross . Its first public appearance was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Washington stood uncovered at the foot of the pole . It has waved ever since in its spotless beauty and untarnished glory . Shall it be lowered now ? lowered so much as the fraction of an inch ? " Breathes there a man with soul so dead who never to himself hath said , ' This is my own , my native land ' ? "
