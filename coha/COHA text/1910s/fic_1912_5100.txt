I got in Minsk a cousin by the name Pincus Lubliner , understand me , which every time he writes me , y'understand , a relation dies on him and he wants me I should help pay funeral expenses . You might think I was a Free Burial Society , the way that feller acts . " " Sure , I know , " Philip replied as he folded the letter away ; " but this here is something else again . Mind you , with his own landlord he is sitting playing cards , Marcus , and comes a pistol through the window and the landlord drops dead . " " What have you got to do with the landlord ? " Polatkin retorted . " If it was your brother-in-law was killed that 's a difference matter entirely ; but when a feller is a landlord im Russland , understand me , the least he could expect is that he gets killed once in a while . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Philip protested , " but my brother-in-law writes they are afraid for their lives there and I should send ' em quick the passage money for him and his boy Yosel to come to America . " Polatkin rose to his feet and glared angrily at his partner . " Do you mean to told me you are going to send that loafer money he should come over here and bum round our shop yet ? " " What do you mean bum round our shop ? " Philip demanded . " In the first place , Polatkin , I ai n't said I am going to send him money , y'understand ; and , in the second place , if I want to send the feller money to come over here , understand me , that 's my business . Furthermore , when you are coming to call my brother-in-law a loafer and a bum , Polatkin , you do n't know what you are talking about . His Grossvater , olav hasholem , was the great Harkavy Rav , Jochannon Borrochson . " " I heard that same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a Schlemiel and a lowlife which he could n't support his wife and children , understand me , and it always turns out his grandfather was a big rabbi in the old country . The way it is with me , Scheikowitz , just so soon as I am hearing a feller 's grandfather was a big rabbi in the old country , Scheikowitz , I would n't got nothing more to do with him . If he works for you in your place , understand me , then he fools away your time telling the operators what a big rabbi his grandfather was ; and if he 's a customer , Scheikowitz , and you write him ten days after the account is overdue he should pay you what he owes you , instead he sends you a check , understand me , he comes down to the store and tells you what a big rabbi he 's got it for a grandfather . Gott sei Dank I ai n't got no Rabonim in my family . " " Sure , I know , " Philip cried , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name even . " Polatkin shrugged his shoulders . " It would oser worry me if my whole family could n't read or write . So long as I can sign my name and the money is in the bank to make the check good from five to ten thousand dollars , y'understand , what do I care if my grandfather would be deef , dumb and blind , Scheikowitz ? Furthermore , Scheikowitz , believe me I would sooner got one good live business man for a partner , Scheikowitz , than a million dead rabbis for a grandfather , and do n't you forget it . So if you are going to spend the whole morning making a Geschreierei over that letter , Scheikowitz , we may as well close up the store und fertig . " With this ultimatum Marcus Polatkin walked rapidly away toward the cutting room , while Philip Scheikowitz sought the foreman of their manufacturing department and borrowed a copy of a morning paper . It was printed in the vernacular of the lower East Side , and Philip bore it to his desk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the column of steamboat advertising and made figures on the back of an envelope . These represented the cost of a journey for two persons from Minsk to New York , based on Philip 's hazy recollection of his own emigration , fifteen years before , combined with his experience as travelling salesman in the Southern States for a popular-price line of pants . At length he concluded his calculations and with a heavy sigh he put on his hat just as his partner returned from the cutting room . " Nu ! " Polatkin cried . " Where are you going now ? " " I am going for a half an hour somewheres , " Philip replied . " What for ? " Polatkin demanded . " What for is my business , " Philip answered . " Your business ? " Polatkin exclaimed . " At nine o'clock in the morning one partner puts on his hat and starts to go out , verstehst du , and when the other partner asks him where he is going it 's his business , sagt er ! What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am coming down here because I got such a partner , Polatkin , which if I was to miss one day even I would n't know where I stand at all , " Scheikowitz retorted . " Furthermore , you should n't worry yourself , Polatkin ; for my own sake I would come back just so soon as I could . " Despite the offensive repartee that accompanied Philip 's departure , however , he returned to find Polatkin entirely restored to good humour by a thousand-dollar order that had arrived in the ten-o'clock mail ; and as Philip himself felt the glow of conscious virtue attendant upon a good deed economically performed , he immediately fell into friendly conversation with his partner . " Well , Marcus , " he said , " I sent ' em the passage tickets , and if you ai n't agreeable that Borrochson comes to work here I could easy find him a job somewheres else . " " If we got an opening here , Philip , what is it skin off my face if the feller comes to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gets the same pay like somebody else ? " " What could I do , Marcus ? " Philip rejoined , as he took off his hat and coat preparatory to plunging into the assortment of a pile of samples . " My own flesh and blood I must got to look out for , ai n't it ? And if my sister Leah , olav hasholem , would be alive to-day I would of got ' em all over here long since ago already . Ai n't I am right ? " Polatkin shrugged . " In family matters one partner could n't advise the other at all , " he said . " Sure , I know , " Philip concluded , " but when a feller has got such a partner which he is a smart , up-to-date feller and means good by his partner , understand me , then I got a right to take an advice from him about family matters , ai n't it ? " And with these honeyed words the subject of the Borrochson family 's assisted emigration was dismissed until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , Marcus , " Philip cried after he had read it , " he 'll be here Saturday . " " Who 'll be here Saturday ? " Polatkin asked . " Borrochson , " Philip replied ; " and the boy comes with him . " Polatkin raised his eyebrows . " I 'll tell you the honest truth , Philip , " he said  --  " I 'm surprised to hear it . " " What d'ye mean you 're surprised to hear it ? " Philip asked . " Ai n't I am sending him the passage tickets ? " " Sure , I know you are sending him the tickets , " Polatkin continued , " but everybody says the same , Philip , and that 's why I am telling you , Philip , I 'm surprised to hear he is coming ; because from what everybody is telling me it 's a miracle the feller ai n't sold the tickets and gambled away the money . " " What are you talking nonsense , selling the tickets ! " Philip cried indignantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if he would be a poor man . " " He ai n't so poor , " Polatkin retorted . " A thief need never got to be poor , Scheikowitz . " " A thief ! " Philip exclaimed . " That 's what I said , " Polatkin went on , " and a smart thief too , Scheikowitz . Gifkin says he could steal the buttons from a policeman 's pants and pass ' em off for real money , understand me , and they could n't catch him anyhow . " " Gifkin ? " Philip replied . " Meyer Gifkin which he is working for us now two years , Scheikowitz , and a decent , respectable feller , " Polatkin said relentlessly . " If Gifkin tells you something you could rely on it , Scheikowitz , and he is telling me he lives in Minsk one house by the other with this feller Borrochson , and such a lowlife gambler bum as this here feller Borrochson is you would n't believe at all . " " Meyer Gifkin says that ? " Philip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as assistant cutter , " Polatkin continued . " And if you think that this here feller Borrochson comes to work in our place , Scheikowitz , you 've got another think coming , and that 's all I got to say . " But Philip had not waited to hear the conclusion of his partner 's ultimatum , and by the time Polatkin had finished Philip was at the threshold of the cutting room . " Gifkin ! " he bellowed . " I want to ask you something a question . " The assistant cutter laid down his shears . " What could I do for you , Mr. Scheikowitz ? " he said respectfully . " You could put on your hat and coat and get out of here before I kick you out , " Philip replied without disclosing the nature of his abandoned question . " And , furthermore , if my brother-in-law Borrochson is such a lowlife bum which you say he is , when he is coming here Saturday he would pretty near kill you , because , Gifkin , a lowlife gambler and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he ai n't a such thief and gambler which you say he is , then I would make you arrested . " " Me arrested ? " Gifkin cried . " What for ? " " Because for calling some one a thief which he ai n't one you could sit in prison , " Scheikowitz concluded . " So you should get right out of here before I am sending for a policeman . " " But , Mr. Scheikowitz , " Gifkin protested , " who did I told it your brother-in-law is a thief and a gambler ? " " You know very well who you told it , " Scheikowitz retorted . " You told it my partner , Gifkin . That 's who you told it . " " But I says to him he should n't tell nobody , " Gifkin continued . " Is it my fault your partner is such a Klatsch ? And , anyhow , Mr. Scheikowitz , supposing I did say your brother-in-law is a gambler and a thief , I know what I 'm talking about ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place where I could n't open my mouth at all , Mr. Scheikowitz , I do n't want to work there , and that 's all there is to it . " He assumed his hat and coat in so dignified a manner that for the moment Scheikowitz felt as though he were losing an old and valued employee , and this impression was subsequently heightened by Polatkin 's behaviour when he heard of Gifkin 's departure . Indeed a casual observer might have supposed that Polatkin 's wife , mother , and ten children had all perished in a common disaster and that the messenger had been indiscreet in breaking the news , for during a period of almost half an hour Polatkin rocked and swayed in his chair and beat his forehead with his clenched fist . " You are shedding my blood , " he moaned to Scheikowitz . " What the devil you are talking nonsense ! " Scheikowitz declared . " The way you are acting you would think we are paying the feller five thousand dollars a year instead of fifteen dollars a week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Scheikowitz ; it 's what you make from him what counts , " he wailed . " Gifkin was really worth to us a year five thousand dollars . " " Five thousand buttons ! " Scheikowitz cried . " You are making a big fuss about nothing at all . " But when the next day Polatkin and Scheikowitz heard that Gifkin had found employment with their closest competitors Philip began to regret the haste with which he had discharged his assistant cutter , and he bore his partner 's upbraidings in chastened silence . Thus by Friday afternoon Polatkin had exhausted his indignation . " Well , Philip , " he said as closing-time approached , " it ai n't no use crying over sour milk . What time does the boat arrive ? " " To-night , " Philip replied , " and the passengers comes off the island to-morrow . Why did you ask ? " " Because , " Marcus said with the suspicion of a blush , " Saturday ai n't such a busy day and I was thinking I would go over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " * * * * * Philip 's trip with his partner to Ellis Island the following morning tried his temper to the point where he could barely refrain from inquiring if the expected immigrant were his relation or Polatkin 's , for during the entire journey Marcus busied himself making plans for the Borrochsons ' future . " The first thing you got to look out for with a greenhorn , Philip , " he said , " is that you learn ' em good the English language . If a feller could n't talk he could n't do nothing , understand me , so with the young feller especially you should n't give him no encouragement to keep on talking Manerloschen . " Philip nodded politely . " Look at me for instance , " Marcus continued ; " six months after I landed , Philip , I am speaking English already just so good as a doctor or a lawyer . And how did I done it ? To night school I am going only that they should learn me to write , verstehst du , aber right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he talks to me only in English . And if I am understanding him , schon gut ; and if I do n't understand him then he gives me a potch on the side of the head , Philip , which the next time he says it I could understand him good . And that 's the way you should do with the young feller , Philip . I bet yer he would a damsight sooner learn English as get a Schlag every ten minutes . " Again Philip nodded , and by the time they had arrived at the enclosure for the relations of immigrants he had become so accustomed to the hum of Marcus ' conversation that he refrained from uttering even a perfunctory " Uh-huh . " They sat on a hard bench for more than half an hour , while the attendants bawled the common surnames of every country from Ireland to Asiatic Turkey , and at length the name Borrochson brought Philip to his feet . He rushed to the gateway , followed by Marcus , just as a stunted lad of fifteen emerged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Uncle Philip , " the lad cried , dropping the bundle . Then clutching Marcus round the neck he showered kisses on his cheeks until Philip dragged him away . " I am your uncle , " Philip said in Juedisch Deutsch . " Where is your father ? " Without answering the question Yosel Borrochson took a stranglehold of Philip and subjected him to a second and more violent osculation . It was some minutes before Philip could disengage himself from his nephew 's embrace and then he led him none too gently to a seat . " Never mind the kissing , " he said ; " where 's your father ? " " He is not here , " Yosel Borrochson replied with a vivid blush . " I see he is not here , " Philip rejoined . " Where is he ? " " He is in Minsk , " said young Borrochson . " In Minsk ? " Philip and Marcus cried with one voice , and then Marcus sat down on the bench and rocked to and fro in an ecstasy of mirth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slapped his thighs by way of giving expression to his emotions . " Did you ever hear the like ? " " Polatkin , do me the favour , " Philip begged , " and do n't make a damn fool of yourself . " " What did I told you ? " Polatkin retorted , but Philip turned to his nephew . " What did your father do with the ticket and the money I sent him ? " he asked . " He sold the ticket and he used all the money for the wedding , " the boy replied . " The wedding ? " Philip exclaimed . " What wedding ? " " The wedding with the widow , " said the boy . " The widow ? " Philip and Marcus shouted in unison . " What widow ? " " The landlord 's widow , " the boy answered shyly . And then as there seemed nothing else to do he buried his face in his hands and wept aloud . " Nu , Philip , " Marcus said , sitting down beside young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father is a Ganef ? " Philip made no reply , and presently Marcus stooped and picked up the bundle . " Come , " he said gently , " let 's go up to the store . " The journey uptown was not without its unpleasant features , for the size of the bundle not only barred them from both subway and elevated , but provoked a Broadway car conductor to exhibit what Marcus considered to be so biased and illiberal an attitude toward unrestricted immigration that he barely avoided a cerebral hemorrhage in resenting it . They finally prevailed on the driver of a belt-line car to accept them as passengers , and nearly half an hour elapsed before they arrived at Desbrosses Street ; but after a dozen conductors in turn had declined to honour their transfer tickets they made the rest of their journey on foot . Philip and young Borrochson carried the offending bundle , for Marcus flatly declined to assist them . Indeed with every block his enthusiasm waned , so that when they at length reached Wooster Street his feelings toward his partner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetch that thing in here , " he said as Philip and young Borrochson entered the showroom with the bundle ; " leave it in the shop . You got no business to bring the young feller up here in the first place . " " What do you mean bring him up here ? " Philip cried . " If you would n't butt in at all I intended to take him to my sister 's a cousin on Pitt Street . " Marcus threw his hat on a sample table and sat down heavily . " That 's all the gratitude I am getting ! " he declared with bitter emphasis . " Right in the busy season I dropped everything to help you out , and you turn on me like this . " He rose to his feet suddenly , and seizing the bundle with both hands he flung it violently through the doorway . " Take him to Pitt Street , " he said . " Take him to the devil for all I care . I am through with him . " But Philip conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street , and when an hour later Yosel Borrochson returned with his uncle his top-boots had been discarded forever , while his wrinkled , semi-military garb had been exchanged for a neat suit of Oxford gray . Moreover , both he and Philip had consumed a hearty meal of coffee and rolls and were accordingly prepared to take a more cheerful outlook upon life , especially Philip . " Bleib du hier , " he said as he led young Borrochson to a chair in the cutting room . " Ich Komm bald zurueck . " Then mindful of his partner 's advice he broke into English . " Shtay here , " he repeated in loud , staccato accents . " I would be right back . Verstehst du ? " " Yess-ss , " Yosel replied , uttering his first word of English . With a delighted grin Philip walked to the showroom , where Polatkin sat wiping away the crumbs of a belated luncheon of two dozen zwieback and a can of coffee . " Nu , " he said conciliatingly , " what is it now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his head in the direction of the cutting room , " I want to show you something a picture . " " A picture ! " Polatkin repeated as he rose to his feet . " What do you mean a picture ? " " Come , " Philip said ; " I 'll show you . " He led the way to the cutting room , where Yosel sat awaiting his uncle 's return . " What do you think of him now ? " Philip demanded . " Ai n't he a good-looking young feller ? " Marcus shrugged in a non-committal manner . " Look what a bright eye he got it , " Philip insisted . " You could tell by looking at him only that he comes from a good family . " " He looks a boy like any other boy , " said Marcus . " But even if no one would told you , Marcus , you could see from his forehead yet  --  and the big head he 's got it  --  you could see that somewheres is Rabonim in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You could just so much see from his head that his grandfather is a rabbi as you could see from his hands that his father is a crook . " He turned impatiently away . " So instead you should be talking a lot of nonsense , Philip , you should set the boy to work sweeping the floor , " he continued . " Also for a beginning we would start him in at three dollars a week , and if the boy gets worth it pretty soon we could give him four . " In teaching his nephew the English language Philip Scheikowitz adopted no particular system of pedagogy , but he combined the methods of Ollendorf , Chardenal , Ahn and Polatkin so successfully that in a few days Joseph possessed a fairly extensive vocabulary . To be sure , every other word was acquired at the cost of a clump over the side of the head , but beyond a slight ringing of the left ear that persisted for nearly six months the Polatkin method of instruction vindicated itself , and by the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his employers . " Ai n't it something which you really could say is wonderful the way that boy gets along ? " Philip declared to his partner , as the first anniversary of Joseph 's landing approached . " Honestly , Marcus , that boy talks English like he would be born here already . " " Sure , I know , " Marcus agreed . " He 's got altogether too much to say for himself . Only this morning he tells me he wants a raise to six dollars a week . " " Could you blame him ? " Philip asked mildly . " He 's doing good work here , Marcus . " " Yow ! he 's doing good work ! " Marcus exclaimed . " He 's fresh like anything , Scheikowitz . If you give him the least little encouragement , Scheikowitz , he would stand there and talk to you all day yet . " " Not to me he do n't , " Philip retorted . " Lots of times I am asking him questions about the folks in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greenhorns like them I do n't bother myself at all . ' Calls his father a greenhorn yet ! " Marcus flapped his right hand in a gesture of impatience . " He could call his father a whole lot worse , " he said . " Why , that Ganef ai n't even wrote you at all since the boy comes over here . Not only he 's a crook , Scheikowitz , but he 's got a heart like a brick . " Philip shrugged his shoulders . " What difference does it make if he is a crook ? " he rejoined . " The boy 's all right anyway . Yes , Marcus , the boy is something which you could really say is a jewel . " " Geh weg ! " Marcus cried disgustedly  --  " a jewel ! " " That 's what I said , " Philip continued  --  " a jewel . Tell me , Marcus , how many boys would you find it which they are getting from three to five dollars a week and in one year saves up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning and says to me I should take the money for what it costs to keep him while he is learning the language , and for buying him his clothes when he first comes here . Supposing his father is a crook , Marcus , am I right or wrong ? " " Talk is cheap , Scheikowitz , " Marcus retorted . " He only says he would pay you the money , Scheikowitz , ai n't it ? " Philip dug down into his pocket and produced a roll of ragged one and two dollar bills , which he flung angrily on to a sample table . " Count ' em , " he said . Marcus shrugged again . " What is it my business ? " he said . " And anyhow , Scheikowitz , I must say I 'm surprised at you . A poor boy saves up a hundred dollars out of the little we are paying him here , and actually you are taking the money from him . Could n't you afford it to spend on the boy a hundred dollars ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pocketed the bills . " Sure I could and I 'm going to too . I 'm going to take this here money and put it in the bank for the boy , with a hundred dollars to boot , Polatkin , and when the boy gets to be twenty-one he would anyhow got in savings bank a couple hundred dollars . " Polatkin nodded shamefacedly . " Furthermore , Polatkin , " Philip continued , " if you got such a regard for the boy which you say you got it , understand me , I would like to make you a proposition . Ever since Gifkin leaves us , y'understand , we got in our cutting room one Schlemiel after another . Ai n't it ? Only yesterday we got to fire that young feller we took on last week , understand me , and if we get somebody else in his place to-day , Polatkin , the chances is we would get rid of him to-morrow , and so it goes . " Again Polatkin nodded . " So , therefore , what is the use talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take Joe Borrochson and learn him he should be a cutter , and in six months ' time , Polatkin , I bet yer he would be just so good a cutter as anybody . " At this juncture Polatkin raised his hand with the palm outward . " Stop right there , Scheikowitz , " he said . " You are making a fool of yourself , Scheikowitz , because , Scheikowitz , admitting for the sake of no arguments about it that the boy is a good boy , understand me , after all he 's only a boy , ai n't it , and if you are coming to make a sixteen-year-old boy an assistant cutter , y'understand , the least that we could expect is that our customers fires half our goods back at us . " " But  --   --  " Scheikowitz began . " But , nothing , Scheikowitz , " Polatkin interrupted . " This morning I seen it Meyer Gifkin on Canal Street and he ai n't working for them suckers no more ; and I says to him is he willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says yes , providing you would see that this here feller Borrochson would n't pretty near kill him . " " What do you mean pretty near kill him ? " Scheikowitz cried . " Do you mean to say he is afraid of a boy like Joe Borrochson ? " " Not Joe Borrochson , " Polatkin replied . " He is all the time thinking that your brother-in-law Borrochson comes over here with his boy and is working in our place yet , and when I told him that that crook did n't come over at all Meyer says that 's the first he hears about it or he would have asked for his job back long since already . So he says he would come in here to see us this afternoon . " " But  --   --  " Scheikowitz began again . " Furthermore , " Polatkin continued hastily , " if I would got a nephew in my place , Scheikowitz , I would a damsight sooner he stays working on the stock till he knows enough to sell goods on the road as that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Scheikowitz sighed heavily by way of surrender . " All right , Polatkin , " he said ; " if you 're so dead set on taking this here feller Gifkin back go ahead . But one thing I must got to tell you : If you are taking a feller back which you fired once , understand me , he acts so independent you could n't do nothing with him at all . " " Leave that to me , " Polatkin said , as he started for the cutting room , and when Scheikowitz followed him he found that Gifkin had already arrived . " Wie gehts , Mister Scheikowitz ? " Gifkin cried , and Philip received the salutation with a distant nod . " I hope you do n't hold no hard feelings for me , " Gifkin began . " Me hold hard feelings for you ? " Scheikowitz exclaimed . " I guess you forget yourself , Gifkin . A boss do n't hold no hard feelings for a feller which is working in the place , Gifkin ; otherwise the feller gets fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polatkin in the role of peacemaker created a diversion . " Joe , " he called to young Borrochson , who was passing the cutting-room door , " come in here a minute . " He turned to Gifkin as Joe entered . " I guess you seen this young feller before ? " he said . Gifkin looked hard at Joe for a minute . " I think I seen him before somewheres , " he replied . " Sure you seen him before , " Polatkin rejoined . " His name is Borrochson . " " Borrochson ! " Gifkin cried , and Joe , whose colour had heightened at the close scrutiny to which he had been subjected , began to grow pale . " Sure , Yosel Borrochson , the son of your old neighbour , " Polatkin explained , but Gifkin shook his head slowly . " That ai n't Yosel Borrochson , " he declared , and then it was that Polatkin and Scheikowitz first noticed Joe 's embarrassment . Indeed even as they gazed at him his features worked convulsively once or twice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of excitement that ensued Gifkin 's avowed discovery was temporarily forgotten , but when Joe was again restored to consciousness Polatkin drew Gifkin aside and requested an explanation . " What do you mean the boy ai n't Yosel Borrochson ? " he demanded . " I mean the boy ai n't Yosel Borrochson , " Gifkin replied deliberately . " I know this here boy , Mr. Polatkin , and , furthermore , Borrochson 's boy is got one bum eye , which he gets hit with a stone in it when he was only four years old already . Do n't I know it , Mr. Polatkin , when with my own eyes I seen this here boy throw the stone yet ? " " Well , then , who is this boy ? " Marcus Polatkin insisted . " He 's a boy by the name Lubliner , " Gifkin replied , " which his father was Pincus Lubliner , also a crook , Mr. Polatkin , which he would steal anything from a toothpick to an oitermobile , understand me . " " Pincus Lubliner ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Gifkin continued , rushing headlong to his destruction . " Pincus Lubliner , which honestly , Mr. Polatkin , there 's nothing that feller would n't do  --  a regular Rosher if ever there was one . " For one brief moment Polatkin 's eyes flashed angrily , and then with a resounding smack his open hand struck Gifkin 's cheek . " Liar ! " he shouted . " What do you mean by it ? " Scheikowitz , who had been tenderly bathing Joe Borrochson 's head with water , rushed forward at the sound of the blow . " Marcus , " he cried , " for Heaven 's sake , what are you doing ? You should n't kill the feller just because he makes a mistake and thinks the boy ai n't Joe Borrochson . " " He makes too many mistakes , " Polatkin roared . " Calls Pincus Lubliner a crook and a murderer yet , which his mother was my own father 's a sister . Did you ever hear the like ? " He made a threatening gesture toward Gifkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lookyhere , Marcus , " Scheikowitz asked , " what has Pincus Lubliner got to do with this ? " " He 's got a whole lot to do with it , " Marcus replied , and then his eyes rested on Joe Borrochson , who had again lapsed into unconsciousness . " Oo-ee ! " Marcus cried . " The poor boy is dead . " He swept Philip aside and ran to the water-cooler , whence he returned with the drip-bucket brimming over . This he emptied on Joe Borrochson 's recumbent form , and after a quarter of an hour the recovery was permanent . In the meantime Philip had interviewed Meyer Gifkin to such good purpose that when he entered the firm 's office with Meyer Gifkin at his heels he was fairly spluttering with rage . " Thief ! " he yelled . " Out of here before I make you arrested . " " Who the devil you think you are talking to ? " Marcus demanded . " I am talking to Joseph Borrochson , " Scheikowitz replied . " That 's who I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't no such person here , " Polatkin retorted . " There 's here only a young fellow by the name Elkan Lubliner , which he is my own father 's sister a grandson , and he ai n't no more a thief as you are . " " Ai n't he ? " Philip retorted . " Well , all I can say is he is a thief and his whole family is thieves , the one worser as the other . " Marcus glowered at his partner . " You should be careful what you are speaking about , " he said . " Maybe you ai n't aware that this here boy 's grandfather on his father 's side was Reb Mosha , the big Lubliner Rav , a Chosid and a Tzadek if ever there was one . " " What difference does that make ? " Philip demanded . " He is stealing my brother-in-law 's passage ticket anyhow . " " I did n't steal it , " the former Joseph Borrochson cried . " My father paid him good money for it , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and you also I am paying a hundred dollars . " " Yow ! Your father paid him good money for it ! " Philip jeered . " A Ganef like your father is stealing the money , too , I bet yer . " " Oser a Stueck , " Polatkin declared . " I am sending him the money myself to help bury his aunt , Mrs. Lebowitz . " " You sent him the money ? " Philip cried . " And your own partner you did n't tell nothing about it at all ! " " What is it your business supposing I am sending money to the old country ? " Marcus retorted . " Do you ask me an advice when you are sending away money to the old country ? " " But the feller did n't bury his aunt at all , " Philip said . " Yes , he did too , " the former Joseph Borrochson protested . " Instead of a hundred dollars the funeral only costs fifty . Anybody could make an overestimate . Ai n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philip , " he said , " and anyhow what does this loafer come butting in here for ? " As he spoke he indicated Meyer Gifkin with a jerk of the chin . " He ai n't butting in here , " Philip declared ; " he comes in here because I told him to . I want you should make an end of this nonsense , Polatkin , and hire a decent assistant cutter . Gifkin is willing to come back for twenty dollars a week . " " He is , is he ? " Marcus cried . " Well , if he was willing to come back for twenty dollars a week why did n't he come back before ? Now it 's too late ; I got other plans . Besides , twenty dollars is too much . " " You know very well why I ai n't come back before , Mr. Polatkin , " Gifkin protested . " I was afraid for my life from that murderer Borrochson . " Philip scowled suddenly . " My partner is right , Gifkin , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , it ai n't , " Gifkin declared . " If I would be still working for you , Mr. Scheikowitz , I would be getting more as twenty dollars by now . And was it my fault you are firing me ? By rights I should have sued you in the courts yet . " " What d'ye mean sue us in the courts ? " Philip exclaimed . He was growing increasingly angry , but Gifkin heeded no warning . " Because you are firing me just for saying a crook is a crook , " Gifkin replied , " and here lately you found out for yourself this here Borrochson is nothing but a Schwindler  --  a Ganef . " " What are you talking about  --  a Schwindler ? " Philip cried , now thoroughly aroused . " Ai n't you heard the boy says Borrochson is marrying the landlord 's widow ? Could a man get married on wind , Gifkin ? " " Yow ! he married the landlord 's widow ! " Gifkin said . " I bet yer that crook gambles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe anything this here boy tells you , Mr. Scheikowitz ? " The question fell on deaf ears , however , for at the repetition of the word crook Philip flung open the office door . " Out of here , " he roared , " before I kick you out . " Simultaneously Marcus grabbed the luckless Gifkin by the collar , and just what occurred between the office and the stairs could be deduced from the manner in which Marcus limped back to the office . " Gott sei Dank we are rid of the fellow , " he said as he came in. * * * * * Although Philip Scheikowitz arrived at his place of business at half-past seven the following morning he found that Marcus and Elkan Lubliner had preceded him , for when he entered the showroom Marcus approached with a broad grin on his face and pointed to the cutting room , where stood Elkan Lubliner . In the boy 's right hand was clutched a pair of cutter 's shears , and guided by chalked lines he was laboriously slicing up a roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Marcus exclaimed . " A picture ! " Philip repeated . " What d'ye mean a picture ? " " Why , the way he stands there with them shears , Philip , " Marcus replied . " He 's really what you could call a born cutter if ever there was one . " " A cutter ! " Philip cried . " Sure , " Marcus went on . " It 's never too soon for a young feller to learn all sides of his trade , Philip . He 's been long enough on the stock . Now he should learn to be a cutter , and I bet yer in six months ' time yet he would be just so good a cutter as anybody . " Philip was too dazed to make any comment before Marcus obtained a fresh start . " A smart boy like him , Philip , learns awful quick , " he said . " Ai n't it funny how blood shows up ? Now you take a boy like him which he comes from decent , respectable family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I told you his grandfather on his father 's side was a big rabbi , the Lubliner Rav . " Philip nodded . " And even if I did n't told you , " Marcus went on , " you could tell it from his face . " Again Philip nodded . " And another thing I want to talk to you about , " Marcus said , hastening after him : " the hundred dollars the boy gives you you should keep , Philip . And if you are spending more than that on the boy I would make it good . " Philip dug down absently into his trousers pocket and brought forth the roll of dirty bills . " Take it , " he said , throwing it toward his partner . " I do n't want it . " " What d'ye mean you do n't want it ? " Marcus cried . " I mean I ai n't got no hard feelings against the boy , " Philip replied . " I am thinking it over all night , and I come to the conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle I would continue that way . So you should put the money in the savings bank like I says yesterday . " " But  --   --  " Marcus protested . " But nothing , " Philip interrupted . " Do what I am telling you . " Marcus blinked hard and cleared his throat with a great , rasping noise . " After all , " he said huskily , " it do n't make no difference how many crooks oder Ganevim is in a feller 's family , Philip , so long as he 's got a good , straight business man for a partner . " CHAPTER TWO APPENWEIER 'S ACCOUNT HOW ELKAN LUBLINER GRADUATED INTO SALESMANSHIP " When I hire a salesman , Mr. Klugfels , " said Marcus Polatkin , senior partner of Polatkin &amp; Scheikowitz , " I hire him because he 's a salesman , not because he 's a nephew . " " But it do n't do any harm for a salesman to have an uncle whose concern would buy in one season from you already ten thousand dollars goods , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a bright , smart boy ; and you can take it from me , Mr. Polatkin , not alone he would get my trade , but us buyers is got a whole lot of influence one with the other , understand me ; so , if there 's any other concern you have n't on your books at present , you could rely on me I should do my best for Harry and you . " Thus spoke Mr. Felix Klugfels , buyer for Appenweier &amp; Murray 's Thirty-second Street store , on the first Monday of January ; and in consequence on the second Monday of January Harry Flaxberg came to work as city salesman for Polatkin &amp; Scheikowitz . He also maintained the role of party of the second part in a contract drawn by Henry D. Feldman , whose skill in such matters is too well known for comment here . Sufficient to say it fixed Harry Flaxberg 's compensation at thirty dollars a week and moderate commissions . At Polatkin 's request , however , the document was so worded that it excluded Flaxberg from selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books ; for not only did he doubt Flaxberg 's ability as a salesman , but he was quite conscious of the circumstance that , save for the acquisition of Appenweier &amp; Murray 's account , there was no need of their hiring a city salesman at all , since the scope of their business operations required only one salesman  --  to wit , as the lawyers say , Marcus Polatkin himself . On the other hand , Klugfels had insisted upon the safeguarding of his nephew 's interests , so that the latter was reasonably certain of a year 's steady employment . Hence , when , on the first Monday of February , Appenweier &amp; Murray dispensed with the services of Mr. Klugfels before he had had the opportunity of bestowing even one order on his nephew as a mark of his favour , the business premises of Polatkin &amp; Scheikowitz became forthwith a house of mourning . From the stricken principals down to and including the shipping clerk nothing else was spoken of or thought about for a period of more than two weeks . Neither was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard that Klugfels had been supplanted by Max Lapin , a third cousin of Leon Sammet of the firm of Sammet Brothers . " Ai n't it terrible the way people is related nowadays ? " he said to Scheikowitz , who had just read aloud the news of Max Lapin 's hiring in the columns of the Daily Cloak and Suit Record . " Honestly , Scheikowitz , if a feller ai n't got a lot of retailers oder buyers for distance relations , understand me , he might just so well go out of business and be done with it ! " Scheikowitz threw down the paper impatiently . " That 's where you are making a big mistake , Polatkin , " he said . " A feller which he expects to do business with relations is just so good as looking for trouble . You could never depend on relations that they are going to keep on buying goods from you , Polatkin . The least little thing happens between relations , understand me , and they are getting right away enemies for life ; while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend makes for the other a blue eye , understand me , and in two weeks ' time they are just so good friends as ever . So , even if Appenweier &amp; Murray would n't fire him , y'understand , Klugfels would have dumped this young feller on us anyway . " As he spoke he looked through the office door toward the showroom , where Harry Flaxberg sat with his feet cocked up on a sample table midway in the perusal of the sporting page . " Flaxberg , " Scheikowitz cried , " what are we showing here anyway  --  garments oder shoes ? You are ruining our sample tables the way you are acting ! " Flaxberg replaced his feet on the floor and put down his paper . " It 's time some one ruined them tables on you , Mr. Scheikowitz , " he said . " With the junk fixtures you got it here I 'm ashamed to bring a customer into the place at all . " " That 's all right , " Scheikowitz retorted ; " for all the customers you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got no fixtures at all . Come inside the office  --  my partner wants to speak to you a few words something . " Flaxberg rose leisurely to his feet and , carefully shaking each leg in turn to restore the unwrinkled perfection of his trousers , walked toward the office . " Tell me , Flaxberg , " Polatkin cried as he entered , " what are you going to do about this here account of Appenweier &amp; Murray 's ? " " What am I going to do about it ? " Flaxberg repeated . " Why , what could I do about it ? Every salesman is liable to lose one account , Mr. Polatkin . " " Sure , I know , " Polatkin answered ; " but most every other salesman is got some other accounts to fall back on . Whereas if a salesman is just got one account , Flaxberg , and he loses it , understand me , then he ai n't a salesman no longer , Flaxberg . Right away he becomes only a loafer , Flaxberg , and the best thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and find a job somewheres else . " " Not when he 's got a contract , Mr. Polatkin , " Flaxberg retorted promptly . " And specially a contract which the boss fixes up himself  --  ai n't it ? " Scheikowitz nodded and scowled savagely at his partner . " Listen here to me , Flaxberg , " Polatkin cried . " Do you mean to told me that , even if a salesman would got ever so much a crazy contract , understand me , it allows the salesman he should sit all the time doing nothing in the showroom without we got a right to fire him ? " " Well , " Flaxberg replied calmly , " it gives him the privilege to go out to lunch once in a while . " He pulled down his waistcoat with exaggerated care and turned on his heel . " So I would be back in an hour , " he concluded ; " and if any customers come in and ask for me tell ' em to take a seat till I am coming back . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat and coat in the rear of the showroom and then Polatkin rose to his feet . " Flaxberg , " he cried , " wait a minute ! " Flaxberg returned to the office and nonchalantly lit a cigarette . " Listen here to me , Flaxberg , " Polatkin began . " Take from us a hundred and fifty dollars and quit ! " Flaxberg continued the operation of lighting his cigarette and blew a great cloud of smoke before replying . " What for a piker do you think I am anyhow ? " he asked . " What d'ye mean  --  piker ? " Polatkin said . " A hundred and fifty ai n't to be sneezed at , Flaxberg . " " Ai n't it ? " Flaxberg retorted . " Well , with me , I got a more delicate nose as most people , Mr. Polatkin . I sneeze at everything under five hundred dollars  --  and that 's all there is to it . " Once more he turned on his heel and walked out of the office ; but this time his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite his defiant attitude , Flaxberg 's finances were at low ebb owing to a marked reversal of form exhibited the previous day in the third race at New Orleans . Moreover , he felt confident that a judicious investment of a hundred and fifty dollars would net him that very afternoon at least five hundred dollars , if any reliance were to be placed on the selection of Merlando , the eminent sporting writer of the Morning Wireless . Consequently he afforded every opportunity for Marcus to call him back , and he even paused at the factory door and applied a lighted match to his already burning cigarette . The expected summons failed , however , and instead he was nearly precipitated to the foot of the stairs by no less a person than Elkan Lubliner . " Excuse me , Mr. Flaxberg , " Elkan said . " I ai n't seen you at all . " Flaxberg turned suddenly , but at the sight of Elkan his anger evaporated as he recalled a piece of gossip retailed by Sam Markulies , the shipping clerk , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least two savings-bank accounts and kept in his pocket a bundle of bills as large as a roll of piece goods . " That 's all right , " Flaxberg cried with a forced grin . " I ai n't surprised you are pretty near blinded when you are coming into the daylight out of the cutting room . It 's dark in there like a tomb . " " I bet yer , " Elkan said fervently . " You should get into the air more often , " Flaxberg went on . " A feller could get all sorts of things the matter with him staying in a hole like that . " " Gott sei dank I got , anyhow , my health , " Elkan commented . " Sure , I know , " Flaxberg said as they reached the street ; " but you must got to take care of it too . A feller which he do n't get no exercise should ought to eat well , Lubliner . For instance , I bet yer you are taking every day your lunch in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , there you are ! " Flaxberg cried triumphantly . " A feller works all the time in a dark hole like that cutting room , and comes lunchtime he fresses a bunch of Kuchen and a cup of coffee , verstehst du  --  and is it any wonder you are looking sick ? " " I feel all right , " Elkan said . " I know you feel all right , " Flaxberg continued , " but you look something terrible , Lubliner . Just for to-day , Lubliner , take my advice and try Wasserbauer 's regular dinner . " Elkan laughed aloud . " Wasserbauer 's ! " he exclaimed . " Why , what do you think I am , Mr. Flaxberg ? If I would be a salesman like you , Mr. Flaxberg , I would say , ' Yes ; eat once in a while at Wasserbauer 's ' ; aber for an assistant cutter , Mr. Flaxberg , Wasserbauer 's is just so high like the Waldorfer . " " That 's all right , " Flaxberg retorted airily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come and have a decent meal with me . " For a brief interval Elkan hesitated , but at length he surrendered , and five minutes later he found himself seated opposite Harry Flaxberg in the rear of Wasserbauer 's cafe . " Yes , Mr. Flaxberg , " he said as he commenced the fourth of a series of dill pickles , " compared with a salesman , a cutter is a dawg 's life  --  ai n't it ? " " Well , " Flaxberg commented , " he is and he is n't . There 's no reason why a cutter should n't enjoy life too , Lubliner . A cutter could make money on the side just so good as a salesman . I am acquainted already with a pants cutter by the name Schmul Kleidermann which , one afternoon last week , he pulls down two hundred and fifty dollars yet . " " Pulls down two hundred and fifty dollars ! " Elkan exclaimed . " From where he pulls it down , Mr. Flaxberg ? " " Not from the pants business oser , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lubliner , and that 's how he makes his money . " " You mean he is speculating in these here stocks from stock exchanges ? " Elkan asked . " Not stocks , " Flaxberg replied in shocked accents . " From spieling the stock markets a feller could lose his shirt yet . Never play the stock markets , Lubliner . That 's something which you could really say a feller ruins himself for life with . " Elkan nodded . " Even im Russland it 's the same , " he said . " Sure , " Flaxberg went on . " Aber this feller Kleidermann he makes a study of it . The name of the horse was Prince Faithful . On New Year 's Day he runs fourth in a field of six . The next week he is in the money for a show with such old-timers as Aurora Borealis , Dixie Lad and Ramble Home  --  and last week he gets away with it six to one a winner , understand me ; and this afternoon yet , over to Judge Crowley 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , understand me , which it is like picking up money in the street already . " Elkan paused in the process of commencing the sixth pickle and gazed in wide-eyed astonishment at his host . " So you see , Lubliner , " Flaxberg concluded , " if you would put up twenty dollars , understand me , you could make fifty dollars more , like turning your hand over . " Elkan laid down his half-eaten pickle . " Do you mean to say you want me I should put up twenty dollars on a horse which it is running with other horses a race ? " he exclaimed . " Well , " Flaxberg replied , " of course , if you got objections to putting up money on a horse , Lubliner , why , do n't do it . Lend it me instead the twenty dollars and I would play it ; and if the horse should  --  Gott soll hueten  --  not be in the money , y'understand , then I would give you the twenty dollars back Saturday at the latest . Aber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I would give you your money back this afternoon yet and ten dollars to boot . " For one wavering moment Elkan raised the pickle to his lips and then replaced it on the table . Then he licked off his fingers and explored the recess of his waistcoat pocket . " Here , " he said , producing a dime  --  " here is for the dill pickles , Mr. Flaxberg . " " What d'ye mean ? " Flaxberg cried . " I mean this , " Elkan said , putting on his hat  --  " I mean you should save your money with me and blow instead your friend Kleidermann to dinner , because the proposition ai n't attractive . " * * * * * " Yes , Mr. Redman , " Elkan commented when he resumed his duties as assistant cutter after the five and a half dill pickles had been supplemented with a hasty meal of rolls and coffee , " for a Schlemiel like him to call himself a salesman  --  honestly , it 's a disgrace ! " He addressed his remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who plied his shears industriously at an adjoining table . Joseph , like every other employee of Polatkin &amp; Scheikowitz , was thoroughly acquainted with the details of Flaxberg 's hiring and its denouement . Nevertheless , in his quality of head cutter , he professed a becoming ignorance . " Who is this which you are knocking now ? " he asked . " I am knocking some one which he 's got a right to be knocked , " Elkan replied . " I am knocking this here feller Flaxberg , which he calls himself a salesman . That feller could n't sell a drink of water in the Sahara Desert , Mr. Redman . All he cares about is gambling and going on theaytres . Why , if I would be in his shoes , Mr. Redman , I would n't eat or I would n't sleep till I got from Appenweier &amp; Murray an order . Never mind if my uncle would be fired and Mr. Lapin , the new buyer , is a relation from Sammet Brothers , Mr. Redman , I would get that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yow , you would do wonders ! " Redman said . " The best thing you could do , Lubliner , is to close up your face and get to work . You should n't got so much to say for yourself . A big mouth is only for a salesman , Lubliner . For a cutter it 's nix , understand me ; so you should give me a rest with this here Appenweier &amp; Murray 's account and get busy on them 2060 's . We are behind with ' em as it is . " Thus admonished , Elkan lapsed into silence ; and for more than half an hour he pursued his duties diligently . " Nu ! " Redman said at length . " What 's the matter you are acting so quiet this afternoon ? " " What d'ye mean I am acting quiet , Mr. Redman ? " Elkan asked . " I am thinking  --  that 's all . Without a feller would think once in a while , Mr. Redman , he remains a cutter all his life . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commented . " For instance  --  assistant cutters . " " Sure , I know , " Elkan agreed ; " but salesmen is a whole lot better as cutters oder assistant cutters . A salesman sees life , Mr. Redman . He meets oncet in a while people , Mr. Redman ; while , with us , what is it ? We are shut up here like we would be sitting in prison  --  ai n't it ? " " You ai n't got no kick coming , " Redman said . " A young feller only going on eighteen , understand me , is getting ten dollars a week and he kicks yet . Sitting in prison , sagt er ! Maybe you would like the concern they should be putting in moving pictures here or a phonygraft ! " Elkan sighed heavily by way of reply and for a quarter of an hour longer he worked in quietness , until Redman grew worried at his assistant 's unusual taciturnity . " What 's the trouble you ai n't talking , Lubliner ? " he said . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was about to say that he felt all right when suddenly he received the germ of an inspiration , and in the few seconds that he hesitated it blossomed into a well-defined plan of action . He therefore emitted a faint groan and laid down his shears . " I got a krank right here , " he said , placing his hand on his left side . " Ever since last week I got it . " " Well , why do n't you say something about it before ? " Redman cried anxiously ; for be it remembered that Elkan Lubliner was not only the cousin of Marcus Polatkin but the adopted nephew of Philip Scheikowitz as well . " You should n't let such things go . " " The fact is , " Elkan replied , " I did n't want to say nothing about it to Mr. Polatkin on account he 's got enough to worry him with this here Appenweier &amp; Murray 's account ; and  --   --  " " You got that account on the brain , " Redman interrupted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . Leave me fix it for you . " As he spoke he hastily buttoned on his collar and left the cutting room , while Elkan could not forego a delighted grin . After all , he reflected , he had worked steadily for over a year and a half with only such holidays as the orthodox ritual ordained ; and he was so busy making plans for his first afternoon of freedom that he nearly forgot to groan again when Redman came back with Marcus Polatkin at his heels . " Nu , Elkan ! " Marcus said . " What 's the matter ? Do n't you feel good ? " " I got a krank right here , " Elkan replied , placing his hand on his right side . " I got it now pretty near a week already . " " Well , maybe you should sit down for the rest of the afternoon and file away the old cutting slips , " Marcus said , whereat Elkan moaned and closed his eyes . " I filed ' em away last week already , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay in bed the rest of the afternoon I would be all right to-morrow . " Marcus gazed earnestly at his cousin , whose sufferings seemed to be intensified thereby . " All right , Elkan , " he said . " Go ahead . Go home and tell Mrs. Feinermann she should give you a little Brusttee ; and if you do n't feel better in the morning do n't take it so particular to get here early . " Elkan nodded weakly and five minutes later walked slowly out of the factory . He took the stairs only a little less slowly , but he gradually increased his speed as he proceeded along Wooster Street , until by the time he was out of sight of the firm 's office windows he was fairly running . Thus he arrived at his boarding place on Pitt Street in less than half an hour  --  just in time to interrupt Mrs. Sarah Feinermann as she was about to start on a shopping excursion uptown . Mrs. Feinermann exclaimed aloud at the sight of him , and her complexion grew perceptibly less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early hour could have but one meaning . " What 's the matter  --  you are getting fired ? " she asked . " What d'ye mean  --  getting fired ? " Elkan replied . " I ai n't fired . I got an afternoon off . " Mrs. Feinermann heaved a sigh of relief . As the recipient of Elkan 's five dollars a week board-money , payable strictly in advance , she naturally evinced a hearty interest in his financial affairs . Moreover , she was distantly related to Elkan 's father ; and owing to this kinship her husband , Marx Feinermann , foreman for Kupferberg Brothers , was of the impression that she charged Elkan only three dollars and fifty cents a week . The underestimate more than paid Mrs. Feinermann 's millinery bill , and she was consequently under the necessity of buying Elkan 's silence with small items of laundry work and an occasional egg for breakfast . This arrangement suited Elkan very well indeed ; and though he had eaten his lunch only an hour previously he thought it the part of prudence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of maintaining his privileges as Mrs. Feinermann 's fellow conspirator . " But I am just now getting dressed to go uptown , " she protested . " Where to ? " he demanded . " I got a little shopping to do , " she said ; and Elkan snapped his fingers in the conception of a brilliant idea . " Good ! " he exclaimed . " I would go with you . In three minutes I would wash myself and change my clothes  --  and I 'll be right with you . " " But I got to stop in and see Marx first , " she insisted . " I want to tell him something . " " I wanted to tell him something lots of times already , " Elkan said significantly ; and Mrs. Feinermann sat down in the nearest chair while Elkan disappeared into the adjoining room and performed a hasty toilet . " Schon gut , " he said as he emerged from his room five minutes later ; " we would go right up to Appenweier &amp; Murray 's . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Appenweier &amp; Murray 's , " Mrs. Feinermann cried . " Such a high-price place I could n't afford to deal with at all . " " I did n't say you could , " Elkan replied ; " but it do n't do no harm to get yourself used to such places , on account might before long you could afford to deal there maybe . " " What d'ye mean I could afford to deal there before long ? " Mrs. Feinermann inquired . " I mean this , " Elkan said , and they started down the stairs  --  " I mean , if things turn out like the way I want ' em to , instead of five dollars a week I would give you five dollars and fifty cents a week . " Here he paused on the stair-landing to let the news sink in . " And furthermore , if you would act the way I tell you to when we get up there I would also pay your carfare , " he concluded  --  " one way . " * * * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that afternoon she was immediately accosted by a floorwalker . " What do you wish , madam ? " he said . " I want to buy something a dress for my wife , " Elkan volunteered , stepping from behind the shadow of Mrs. Feinermann , who for her thirty-odd years was , to say the least , buxom . " Your wife ? " the floorwalker repeated . " Sure ; why not ? " Elkan replied . " Maybe I am looking young , but in reality I am old ; so you should please show us the dress department , from twenty-two-fifty to twenty-eight dollars the garment . " The floorwalker ushered them into the elevator and they alighted at the second floor . " Miss Holzmeyer ! " the floorwalker cried ; and in response there approached a lady of uncertain age but of no uncertain methods of salesmanship . She was garbed in a silk gown that might have graced the person of an Austrian grand duchess , and she rustled and swished as she walked toward them in what she had always found to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see some dresses , " the floorwalker said ; and Miss Holzmeyer smiled by a rather complicated process , in which her nose wrinkled until it drew up the corners of her mouth and made her eyes appear to rest like shoe-buttons on the tops of her powdered cheeks . " This way , madam , " she said as she swung her skirts round noisily . " One moment , " Elkan interrupted , for again he had been totally eclipsed by Mrs. Feinermann 's bulky figure . " You ai n't heard what my wife wants yet . " " Your wife ! " Miss Holzmeyer exclaimed . " Sure , my wife , " Elkan replied calmly . " This is my wife if it 's all the same to you and you ai n't got no objections . " He gazed steadily at Miss Holzmeyer , who began to find her definite methods of salesmanship growing less definite , until she blushed vividly . " Not at all , " she said . " Step this way , please . " " Yes , Miss Holzmeyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was telling you , you ai n't found out yet what my wife wants , on account a dress could be from twenty dollars the garment up to a hundred and fifty . " " We have dresses here as high as three hundred ! " Miss Holzmeyer snapped . She had discerned that she was beginning to be embarrassed in the presence of this self-possessed benedick of youthful appearance , and she resented it accordingly . " I ai n't doubting it for a minute , " Elkan replied . " New York is full of suckers , Miss Holzmeyer ; but me and my wife is looking for something from twenty-two-fifty to twenty-eight dollars , Miss Holzmeyer . " Miss Holzmeyer 's temper mounted with each repetition of her surname , and her final " Step this way , please ! " was uttered in tones fairly tremulous with rage . Elkan obeyed so leisurely that by the time Mrs. Feinermann and he had reached the rear of the showroom Miss Holzmeyer had hung three dresses on the back of a chair . " H'allow me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders and held it up in front of him . He shook out the folds and for more than five minutes examined it closely . " I did n't want to see nothing for seventeen-fifty , " he announced at last  --  " especially from last year 's style . " " What do you mean ? " Miss Holzmeyer cried angrily . " That dress is marked twenty-eight dollars and it just came in last week . It 's a very smart model indeed . " " The model I do n't know nothing about , " Elkan replied , " but the salesman must of been pretty smart to stuck you folks like that . " He subjected another gown to a careful scrutiny while Miss Holzmeyer sought the showcases for more garments . " Now , this one here , " he said , " is better value . How much you are asking for this one , please ? " Miss Holzmeyer glanced at the price ticket . " Twenty-eight dollars , " she replied , with an indignant glare . Elkan whistled incredulously . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always heard it that the expenses is high uptown , but even if the walls was hung mit diamonds yet , Miss Holzmeyer , your bosses would n't starve neither . Do you got maybe a dress for twenty-eight dollars which it is worth , anyhow , twenty-five dollars ? " This last jibe was too much for Miss Holzmeyer . " Mis-ter Lap-in ! " she howled , and immediately a glazed mahogany door in an adjoining partition burst open and Max Lapin appeared on the floor of the showroom . " What 's the matter ? " he asked . Miss Holzmeyer sat down in the nearest chair and fanned herself with her pocket handkerchief . " This man insulted me ! " she said ; whereat Max Lapin turned savagely to Elkan . " What for you are insulting this lady ? " he demanded as he made a rapid survey of Elkan 's physical development . He was quite prepared to defend Miss Holzmeyer 's honour in a fitting and manly fashion ; but , during the few seconds that supervened his question , Max reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What d'ye mean insult this lady ? " Elkan asked stoutly . " I never says a word to her . Maybe I ai n't so long in the country as you are , but I got just so much respect for the old folks as anybody . Furthermore , she is showing me here garments which , honest , Mister  --  er  --   --  " " Lapin , " Max said . " Mister Lapin , a house with the reputation of Appenweier &amp; Murray should n't ought to got in stock at all . " " Say , lookyhere , young feller , " Lapin cried , " what are you driving into anyway ? I am buyer here , and if you got any kick coming tell it to me , and do n't go insulting the salesladies . " " I ai n't insulted no saleslady , Mr. Lapin , " Elkan declared . " I am coming here to buy for my wife a dress and certainly I want to get for my money some decent value ; and when this lady shows me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garment  --  " and says it is from this year a model , understand me , naturally I got my own idees on the subject . " Lapin looked critically at the garment in question . " Did you get this style from that third case there , Miss Holzmeyer ? " he asked , and Miss Holzmeyer nodded . " Well , that whole case is full of leftovers and I do n't want it touched , " Lapin said . " Now go ahead and show this gentleman 's wife some more models ; and if he gets fresh let me know  --  that 's all . " " One minute , Mr. Lapin , " Elkan said . " Will you do me the favour and let me show you something ? " He held up the garment last exhibited by Miss Holzmeyer and pointed to the yoke and its border . " This here garment Miss Holzmeyer shows me for twenty-eight dollars , Mr. Lapin , " he said , " and with me and my wife here a dollar means to us like two dollars to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing the precisely selfsame garment like this in Fine Brothers ' for twenty-six dollars , but the border is from silk embroidery , a peacock 's tail design , and the yoke is from gilt net yet , understand me , I got to say something  --  ai n't it ? " Lapin paused in his progress toward his office and even as he did so Elkan 's eyes strayed to a glass-covered showcase . " Why , there is a garment just like Fine Brothers ' model ! " he exclaimed . " Say , lookyhere ! " Lapin demanded as he strode up to the showcase and pulled out the costume indicated by Elkan . " What are you trying to tell me ? This here model is thirty-seven dollars and fifty cents ; so , if you can get it for twenty-six at Fine Brothers ' , go ahead and do it ! " " But , Mr. Lapin , " Elkan said , " that ai n't no way for a buyer of a big concern like this to talk . I am telling you , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move from this spot , the identical selfsame style Fine Brothers got it for twenty-six dollars . I know it , Mr. Lapin , because we are making up that garment in our factory yet , and Fine Brothers takes from us six of that model at eighteen-fifty apiece . " At this unguarded disclosure Lapin 's face grew crimson with rage . " You are making it up in your factory ! " he cried . " Why , you dirty faker you , what the devil you are coming round here bluffing that you want to buy a dress for your wife for ? " Elkan broke into a cold perspiration and looked round for Mrs. Feinermann , the substantial evidence of his marital state ; but at the very beginning of Max Lapin 's indignant outburst she had discreetly taken the first stairway to the right . " Bring that woman back here ! " Max roared . Miss Holzmeyer made a dash for the stairway , and before Elkan had time to formulate even a tentative plan of escape she had returned with her quarry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasped . Her hat was awry , and what had once been a modish pompadour was toppled to one side and shed hairpins with every palsied nod of her head . " I ai n't done nothing ! " she protested . " Sure , you ai n't , " Elkan said ; " so you should keep your mouth shut  --  that 's all . " " I would keep my mouth shut oder not as I please , " Mrs. Feinermann retorted . " Furthermore , you ai n't got no business to get me mixed up in this Geschichte at all ! " " Who are you two anyway ? " Max demanded . " This here feller is a young feller by the name of Elkan Lubliner which he is working by Polatkin &amp; Scheikowitz , " Mrs. Feinermann announced ; " and what he is bringing me up here for is more than I could tell you . " " Ai n't he your husband ? " Max asked . " Oser a Stueck ! " Mrs. Feinermann declared fervently . " A kid like him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's all right , " Elkan rejoined . " Im Russland at my age many a young feller is got twins yet ! " " What 's that got to do with it ? " Max Lapin demanded . " It ai n't got nothing to do with it , " Elkan said , " but it shows that a young feller like me which he is raised in the old country ai n't such a kid as you think for , Mr. Lapin . And when I am telling you that the concern which sells you them goods to retail for twenty-eight dollars is sticking you good , understand me , you could take my word for it just the same like I would be fifty-five even . " Again he seized one of the garments . " And what 's more , " he went on breathlessly , " the workmanship is rotten . Look at here !  --  the seams is falling to pieces already ! " He thrust the garment under Lapin 's nose with one hand , while with the other he dug down into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Here is money  --  fifty dollars ! " He dropped the gown and held out a roll of bills toward Lapin . " Take it ! " he said hysterically . " Take it all ; and if I do n't bring you to-morrow morning , first thing , this same identical style , only A-number-one workmanship , which you could retail for twenty dollars a garment , understand me , keep the money and fertig . " At this juncture the well-nourished figure of Louis Appenweier , senior member of Appenweier &amp; Murray , appeared in the door of the elevator and Max Lapin turned on his heel . " Come into my office , " he hissed ; and as he started for the glazed mahogany door he gathered up the remaining garments and took them with him . For more than half an hour Elkan and Max Lapin remained closeted together , and during that period Elkan conducted a clinic over each garment to such good purpose that Max sent out from time to time for more expensive styles . All of these were in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models the designs of Joseph Redman , slightly altered in the stealing by Leon Sammet . " Yes , Mr. Lapin , " Elkan said , " them models was all designed by our own designer and some one ganvered ' em on us . Furthermore , I could bring you here to-morrow morning at eight o'clock from our sample racks these same identical models , with the prices on ' em marked plain like the figures on a ten-dollar bill , understand me ; and if they ai n't from twenty to thirty per cent . lower as you paid for these here garments I 'd eat ' em ! " For at least ten minutes Max Lapin sat with knitted brows and pondered Elkan 's words . " Eight o'clock is too early , " he announced at last . " Make it half-past nine . " " Six , even , ai n't too early for an up-to-date buyer to look at some genuine bargains , " Elkan insisted ; " and , besides , I must got to get back to the shop at nine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , Mr. Lapin , " Elkan said , rising to his feet . " Make it eight o'clock , and the next time I would come round at half-past nine . " " What d'ye mean the next time ? " Lapin exclaimed . " I mean this would n't be the last time we do business together , because the job as assistant cutter which I got it is just temporary , Mr. Lapin , " he said as he started for the door  --  " just temporary  --  that 's all . " He paused with his hand on the doorknob . " See you at eight o'clock to-morrow morning , " he said cheerfully ; and five minutes later he was having hard work to keep from dancing his way down Thirty-third Street to the subway. * * * * * From half-past seven in the morning until six at night were the working hours of all Polatkin &amp; Scheikowitz 's employees , save only Sam Markulies , the shipping clerk , whose duty it was to unlock the shop at quarter-past seven sharp . This hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an average of once a month , would stroll into the shipping department at closing-time and announce his intention of going to a wedding that evening . Sometimes the proposed excursion was a pinocle party or a visit to the theatre , but the denouement was always the same . The next morning Scheikowitz would arrive at the factory door precisely at quarter-past seven to find Markulies from five to ten minutes late ; whereupon Markulies would receive his discharge , to take effect the following Saturday night  --  and for the ensuing month his punctuality was assured . During the quarter of an hour which preceded the arrival of the other employees , Markulies usually dusted the office and showroom ; and on the morning following Elkan 's holiday this solitary duty was cheered by the presence of Harry Flaxberg . Harry had sought the advice of counsel the previous day and had been warned against tardiness as an excuse for his discharge ; so he was lounging on the sidewalk long before Markulies 's arrival that morning . " Nu , Mr. Flaxberg , " Markulies cried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't sleep last night , " Flaxberg said ; " so I thought I might just so well be here as anywhere . " " Ai n't that the funniest thing ! " Markulies cried . " Me I could n't sleep neither . I got something on my mind . " He unlocked the door as he spoke ; and as he passed up the stairs he declared again that he had something on his mind . " Yow ! " Flaxberg said . " I should got your worries , Markulies . The simple little things which a shipping clerk must got to do would oser give anybody the nervous prostration . " " Is that so ? " Markulies retorted . " Well , I ai n't just the shipping clerk here , Mr. Flaxberg . You must remember I am in charge with the keys also , Mr. Flaxberg ; and I got responsibilities if some one ganvers a couple sample garments once in a while , y'understand  --  right away they would accuse me that I done it . " " Do n't worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't going to ganver no garments on you  --  not this morning anyhow . " " You I ai n't worrying about at all , " Markulies rejoined ; " but that young bloodsucker , Lubliner , Mr. Flaxberg  --  that 's something else again . Actually that young feller is to me something which you could really call a thorn in my pants , Mr. Flaxberg . Just because he is assistant cutter here and I am only the shipping clerk he treats me like I would be the dirt under his feet . Only last night , Mr. Flaxberg , I am locking up the place when that feller comes up the stairs and says to me I should give him the key , as he forgets a package which he left behind him . Mind you , it is already half-past six , Mr. Flaxberg ; and ever since I am living up in the Bronix , Mr. Flaxberg , I am getting kicked out of six places where I am boarding on account no respectable family would stand it , Mr. Flaxberg , that a feller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner . " " You was telling me about Lubliner , " Flaxberg reminded him . " Sure , I know , " Markulies continued . " So I says to him the place is closed and that 's all there is to it . With that , Mr. Flaxberg , the feller takes back his hand  --  so  --  and he gives me a schlag in the stummick , which , honest , if he would n't be from Mr. Polatkin a relation , Mr. Flaxberg , I would right then and there killed him . " For two minutes he patted gently that portion of his anatomy where Elkan 's blow had landed . " He 's a dangerous feller , Mr. Flaxberg , " he went on , " because , just so soon as he opens the door after I am giving him the key , Mr. Flaxberg , he shuts it in my face and springs the bolt on me , Mr. Flaxberg  --  and there I am standing bis pretty near eight o'clock , understand me , till that feller comes out again . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Flaxberg , the way Mrs. Kaller speaks to me you would think I was a dawg yet . How should I know she is getting tickets for the theaytre that evening , Mr. Flaxberg ? And anyhow , Mr. Flaxberg , if people could afford to spend their money going on theaytre , understand me , they do n't need to keep boarders at all  --  especially when I am getting night after night boiled Brustdeckel only . I says to her , ' Mrs. Kaller , ' I says to her , ' why do n't you give me once in a while a change ? ' I says  --   --  " " Did Lubliner have anything with him when he came out ? " Flaxberg interrupted . " Well , sure ; he 'd got the package he forgets , and how a feller could forget a package that size , Mr. Flaxberg  --  honestly , you would n't believe at all ! That 's what it is to be a relation to the boss , Mr. Flaxberg . If I would got such a memory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already . Yes , Mr. Flaxberg , I says to Mrs. Kaller , ' For three and a half dollars a week a feller should get night after night Brustdeckel  --  it 's a shame  --  honest ! ' I says ; and  --  stiegen ! There 's Mr. Scheikowitz ! " As he spoke he seized a feather duster and began to wield it vigorously , so that by the time Philip Scheikowitz reached the showroom door a dense cloud of dust testified to Markulies 's industry . " That 'll do , Sam ! " Philip cried . " What do you want to do here  --  choke us all to death ? " Gradually the dust subsided and disclosed to Philip 's astonished gaze Harry Flaxberg seated on a sample table and apparently lost in the perusal of the Daily Cloak and Suit Record . " Good-morning , Mr. Scheikowitz , " he said heartily , but Philip only grunted in reply . Moreover , he walked hurriedly past Flaxberg and closed the office door behind him with a resounding bang , for he , too , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that advice he had left his bed before daylight , only to find himself forestalled by the wily Flaxberg . Nor was his chagrin at all decreased by Polatkin , who had promised to meet his partner at quarter-past seven . Instead he arrived an hour later and immediately proceeded to upbraid Scheikowitz for Flaxberg 's punctuality . " What do you mean that feller gets here before you ? " he cried . " Did n't you hear it the lawyer distinctively told you you should get here before Flaxberg , and when Flaxberg arrives you should tell him he is fired on account he is late ? Honestly , Scheikowitz , I do n't know what comes over you lately the way you are acting . Here we are paying the lawyer ten dollars he should give us an advice , understand me , and we might just so well throw our money in the streets ! " " But Flaxberg was n't late , Polatkin , " Scheikowitz protested . " He was early . " " Do n't argue with me , Scheikowitz , " Polatkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Philip shrugged despairingly as they walked to the office door . " Flaxberg , " he began as he discerned the city salesman again using a sample table for a footstool , " do n't let us disturb you if you ai n't through reading the paper yet . " " Yes , Flaxberg , " Polatkin added , " you could get down here so early like you would be sleeping in the place all night yet , and what is it ? Take from the table the feet , Flaxberg , and be a man . We got something to say to you . " " Go ahead , Mr. Polatkin , " Flaxberg said as he leisurely brought his feet to the floor . " I 'm listening . " " In the first place , Flaxberg , " Polatkin said , " did it ever occur to you that , even if your uncle would got fired up to Appenweier &amp; Murray 's , Redman designs for us a line of garments here which them people might be interested in anyhow ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Flaxberg cried . " Lapin would n't buy only Sammet Brothers ' line if we got Worth and Paquin both working for us as designers . You could n't convince him otherwise , Mr. Polatkin . " " That 's all right , " Polatkin went on ; " but it would n't do no harm for you to anyhow see the feller and show him a couple garments which we got it here . Take for instance them 1080 's , which we are selling Fine Brothers , oder that 2060  --  that overskirt effect with the gilt net yoke and peacock-feather-design braid , Flaxberg . Them two styles made a big hit , Flaxberg . They are all hanging on that end rack there , Flaxberg , and you could look at ' em for yourself . " Polatkin walked across the showroom to the rack in question . " Especially the 2060 's , " he said as he pulled aside the heavy denim curtain which protected the contents of the rack , " which you could really say is  --   --  " Here he paused abruptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangers , the rack was empty . " What 's this , Scheikowitz ? " he cried with a sweep of his hand in the direction of the rack . " Where is all them 1080 's and 2060 's ? " Hastily the two partners examined every rack in the showroom ; and not only did they fail to discover the missing samples , but they ascertained that , in addition , seven other choice styles had disappeared . " See maybe is Redman using ' em in the cutting room , " Scheikowitz suggested ; and forthwith they made a canvass of the cutting room and factory , in which they were joined by Markulies . " What is the matter , Mr. Scheikowitz ? " he asked . " We are missing a dozen sample garments , " Scheikowitz replied . " Missing ! " Markulies loudly exclaimed . " What d'ye mean  --  missing , Mr. Scheikowitz ? Last night , when I was covering up the racks , everything was in place . " Suddenly a wave of recollection swept over him and he gave tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sank into the nearest chair . " Markulies , " Polatkin cried out , " for Heaven 's sake , what is it ? " " He must of ganvered ' em ! " Markulies wailed . " Right in front of my eyes he done it . " " Who done it ? " Scheikowitz cried . " Lubliner , " Markulies moaned . " Lubliner ! " Polatkin cried . " Do you mean Elkan Lubliner ? " " That 's what I said , " Markulies went on . " Comes half-past six last night , and that ganef makes me a schlag in the stummick , Mr. Polatkin ; and the first thing you know he goes to work and steals from me my keys , Mr. Polatkin , and cleans out the whole place yet . " " Lubliner was here last night after we are going home ? " Polatkin asked . " Sure , he was , " Markulies replied  --  " at half-past six yet . " " Then that only goes to show what a liar you are , " Polatkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home at one o'clock on account the feller is so sick , understand me , he could hardly walk out of the place at all . Furthermore , he says he is going right straight to bed when he leaves here ; so , if you want to explain how it is the garments disappear when you are in the place here alone , Markulies , go ahead with your lies . Might Mr. Scheikowitz stole ' em maybe  --  or I did ! What ? " Markulies began to rock and sway in an agony of woe . " I should never stir from this here chair , Mr. Polatkin , " Markulies protested , " and my mother also , which I am sending her to Kalvaria  --  regular like clockwork  --  ten dollars a month , she should never walk so far from here bis that door , if that ganef did n't come in here last night and make away with the garments ! " " Koosh ! " Polatkin bellowed , and made a threatening gesture toward Markulies just as Scheikowitz stepped forward . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the feller lies we could easy prove it  --  ai n't it ? In the first place , where is Elkan ? " " He must of been sick this morning on account he ai n't here yet , " Polatkin said . " Schon gut , " Scheikowitz rejoined ; " if he ai n't here he ai n't here , verstehst du , aber he is boarding with Mrs. Feinermann , which her husband is Kupferberg Brothers ' foreman  --  ai n't it ? " Polatkin nodded and Scheikowitz turned to Markulies . " Markulies , " he said , " do me the favour and stop that ! You are making me dizzy the way you are acting . Furthermore , Markulies , you should put on right away your hat and run over to Kupferberg Brothers ' and say to Mr. B. Kupferberg you are coming from Polatkin &amp; Scheikowitz , and ask him is he agreeable he should let Marx Feinermann come over and see us  --  and if he wants to know what for tell him we want to get from him a recommendation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He turned to his partner as Markulies started for the stairway . " And a helluva recommendation we would get from him , too , I bet yer ! " he added . " Wasserbauer tells me Elkan was in his place yesterday , and , though he do n't watch every bit of food a customer puts into his mouth , understand me , he says that he eats dill pickles one right after the other ; and then , Polatkin , the young feller gets right up and walks right out of the place without giving any order even . Wasserbauer says he knows it was Elkan because one day I am sending him over to look for you there . Wasserbauer asks him the simple question what he wants you for , and right away Elkan acts fresh to him like anything . " " He done right to act fresh , " Polatkin said as they walked back to the showroom . " What is it Wasserbauer 's business what you want me for ? " " But how comes a young feller like him to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where does he get the money from he should eat there ? " " The fact is "  --  said Flaxberg , who up to this point had remained a silent listener to the entire controversy  --  " the fact is , Mr. Scheikowitz , yesterday I am taking pity on the feller on account he is looking sick ; and I took him into Wasserbauer 's and invited him he should eat a little something . " Here he paused and licked his lips maliciously . " And though I do n't want to say nothing against the feller , understand me , " he continued , " he begins right away to talk about horseracing . " " Horseracing ? " Polatkin cried . Flaxberg nodded and made a gesture implying more plainly than the words themselves : " Can you beat it ? " " Horseracing ! " Scheikowitz repeated . " Well , what do you think of that for a lowlife bum ? " " And when I called him down for gambling , Mr. Polatkin , he walks right out , so independent he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Polatkin , " Flaxberg went on , " Markulies tells me this morning early the same story like he tells you  --  before he knew the goods was missing even . " " Sure , I believe you , " Polatkin retorted . " He was getting the whole thing fixed up beforehand . That 's the kind of Rosher he is . " As he spoke Markulies entered , and there followed on his heels the short , stout figure of Marx Feinermann . " What did I told you ? " Markulies cried . " The feller ai n't home sick at all . He eats his supper last night , and this morning he is got two eggs for his breakfast even . " " S'nough , Markulies ! " Polatkin interrupted . " You got too much to say for yourself . Sit down , Feinermann , and tell us what is the reason Elkan ai n't here this morning . " " You tell me and I would tell you , " Feinermann replied . " All I know is the feller leaves my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes he acts fresh to my wife like anything , Mr. Polatkin . He kicks the coffee ai n't good , even when my wife is giving him two eggs to his breakfast anyhow . What some people expects for three-fifty a week you would n't believe at all ! " " What do you mean  --  three-fifty a week ? " Polatkin demanded . " He pays your wife five dollars a week schon six months ago already . He told me so himself . " " I ai n't responsible for what that boy tells you , " Feinermann said stolidly . " All I know is he pays me three-fifty a week ; and you would think he is used to eating chicken every day from zu Hause yet , the way he is all the time kicking about his food . " Markulies snorted indignantly . " He should got the Machshovos Mrs. Kaller hands it to me , " he said  --  " gekochte Brustdeckel day in , day out ; and then I am accused that I steal samples yet ! I am sick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried . " Listen here to me , Feinermann . Do you mean to told me the boy ai n't paying you five dollars a week board ? " As Feinermann opened his mouth to reply the showroom door opened and Elkan himself entered . " Loafer ! " Scheikowitz roared . " Where was you ? " Elkan made no reply , but walked to the centre of the showroom . " Mr. Polatkin , " he said , " could I speak to you a few words something ? " Polatkin jumped to his feet . " Before you speak to me a few words something , " he said , " I want to ask you what the devil you are telling me lies that you pay Mrs. Feinermann five dollars a week board ? " " What are you bothering about that for now ? " Scheikowitz interrupted . " And , anyhow , you could see by the way the feller is red like blood that he lies to you . " " Furthermore , " Feinermann added , " my wife complains to me last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild fool 's errand , understand me , and together they get pretty near kicked out of a drygoods store . " " She told you that , did she ? " Elkan cried . " That 's what I said ! " Feinermann retorted . " Then , if that 's the case , Feinermann , " Elkan replied , " all I can say is , I am paying your wife five dollars a week board schon six months already , and if she is holding out on you a dollar and a half a week that 's her business  --  not mine . " " Do n't make things worser as they are , Lubliner , " Flaxberg advised . " You are in bad , anyhow , and lying do n't help none . What did you done with the samples you took away from here ? " " What is it your business what I done with ' em ? " Elkan retorted . " Do n't get fresh , Elkan ! " Polatkin said . " What is all this about , anyhow ? First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick ; next , you are going uptown with Mrs. Feinermann and get kicked out of a drygoods store ; then you come back here and steal our samples . " " Steal your samples ! " Elkan cried . " You admitted it yourself just now , " Flaxberg interrupted . " You are a thief as well as a liar ! " Had Flaxberg 's interest in sport extended to pugilism , he would have appreciated the manner in which Elkan 's chest and arm muscles began to swell under his coat , even if the ominous gleam in Elkan 's dark eyes had provided no other warning . As it was , however , Elkan put into practice the knowledge gained by a nightly attendance at the gymnasium on East Broadway . He stepped back two paces , and left followed right so rapidly to the point of Flaxberg 's jaw that the impact sounded like one blow . Simultaneously Flaxberg fell back over the sample tables and landed with a crash against the office partition just as the telephone rang loudly . Perhaps it was as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since , had he been in a rigid posture , he would have assuredly taken the count . Beyond a cut lip , however , and a lump on the back of his head , he was practically unhurt ; and he jumped to his feet immediately . Nor was he impeded by a too eager audience , for Markulies and Feinermann had abruptly fled to the farthermost corner of the cutting room , while Marcus and Philip had ducked behind a sample rack ; so that he had a clear field for the rush he made at Elkan . He yelled with rage as he dashed wildly across the floor , but the yell terminated with an inarticulate grunt when Elkan stopped the rush with a drive straight from the shoulder . It found a target on Flaxberg 's nose , and he crumpled up on the showroom floor . For two minutes Elkan stood still and then he turned to the sample racks . " Mr. Polatkin , " he said , " the telephone is ringing . " Polatkin came from behind the rack and automatically proceeded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtains . " You got to excuse me , Mr. Scheikowitz , " Elkan murmured . " I could n't help myself at all . " " You 've killed him ! " Scheikowitz gasped . " Yow ! I 've killed him ! " Elkan exclaimed . " It would take a whole lot more as that to kill a bum like him . " He bent over Flaxberg and shook him by the shoulder . " Hey ! " he shouted in his ear . " You are ruining your clothes ! " Flaxberg raised his drooping head and , assisted by Elkan , regained his feet and staggered to the water-cooler , where Elkan bathed his streaming nostrils with the icy fluid . At length Scheikowitz stirred himself to action just as Polatkin relinquished the ' phone . " Markulies , " Scheikowitz shouted , " go out and get a policeman ! " " Do n't do nothing of the kind , Markulies ! " Polatkin declared . " I got something to say here too . " He turned severely to Elkan . " Leave that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What right do you got to promise deliveries on them 2060 's in a week ? " " I thought  --   --  " Elkan began . " You ai n't got no business to think , " Polatkin interrupted . " The next time you are selling a concern like Appenweier &amp; Murray do n't promise nothing in the way of deliveries , because with people like them it 's always the same . If you tell ' em a week they ring you up and insist on it they would got to got the goods in five days . " He put his hand on Elkan 's shoulder ; and the set expression of his face melted until his short dark moustache disappeared between his nose and his under lip in a widespread grin . " Come inside the office , " he said  --  " you too , Scheikowitz . Elkan 's got a long story he wants to tell us. " * * * * * Half an hour later , Sam Markulies knocked timidly at the office door . " Mr. Polatkin , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you if he should wait any longer on account they 're very busy over to Kupferberg Brothers ' . " " Tell him he should come in here , " Polatkin said ; and Markulies withdrew after gazing in open-mouthed wonder at the spectacle of Elkan Lubliner seated at Polatkin 's desk , with one of Polatkin 's mildest cigars in his mouth , while the two partners sat in adjacent chairs and smiled on Elkan admiringly . " You want to speak to me , Mr. Polatkin ? " Feinermann asked , as he came in a moment afterward . " Sure , " Polatkin replied as he handed the astonished Feinermann a cigar . " Sit down , Feinermann , and listen to me . In the first place , Feinermann , what for a neighborhood is Pitt Street to live in ? Why do n't you move uptown , Feinermann ? " " A foreman is lucky if he could live in Pitt Street even , " Feinermann said . " You must think I got money , Mr. Polatkin . " " How much more a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued . " At the most ten dollars  --  ai n't it ? " Feinermann nodded sadly . " To a man which he is only a foreman , Mr. Polatkin , ten dollars is ten dollars , " he commented . " Sure , I know , " Polatkin said ; " but instead of five dollars a week board , Elkan would pay you seven dollars a week , supposing you would move up to Lenox Avenue . Ai n't that right , Elkan ? " " Sure , that 's right , " Elkan said . " Only , if I am paying him seven dollars a week board , he must got to give Mrs. Feinermann a dollar and a half extra housekeeping money . Is that agreeable , Feinermann ? " Again Feinermann nodded . " Then that 's all we want from you , Feinermann , " Polatkin added , " except I want to tell you this much : I am asking Elkan he should come uptown and live with me ; and he says no  --  he would prefer to stick where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't got no objections , " he said as he withdrew . " And now , Elkan , " Polatkin cried , " we got to fix it up with the other feller . " Hardly had he spoken when there stood framed in the open doorway the disheveled figure of Flaxberg . " Nu , Flaxberg , " Polatkin said . " What d'ye want from us now ? " " I am coming to tell you this , Mr. Polatkin , " Flaxberg said thickly through his cut and swollen lips : " I am coming to tell you that I 'm sick and so you must give me permission to go home . " " Nobody wants you to stay here , Flaxberg , " Polatkin answered . " Sure , I know , " Flaxberg rejoined ; " but if I would go home without your consent you would claim I made a breach of my contract . " " Do n't let that worry you in the least , Flaxberg , " Polatkin retorted , " because , so far as that goes , we fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make no attempt to sell Appenweier &amp; Murray , when a boy like Elkan , which up to now he was n't even a salesman at all , could sell ' em one thousand dollars goods . " Flaxberg 's puffed features contorted themselves in an expression of astonishment . " Lubliner sells Appenweier &amp; Murray a bill of goods ! " he exclaimed . By way of answer Polatkin held out the order slip for Flaxberg 's inspection . " That 's all right , " Flaxberg declared . " I would make it hot for you anyhow ! You put this young feller up to it that he pretty near kills me . " " Yow ! We put him up to it ! " Polatkin retorted . " You put him up to it yourself , Flaxberg . You are lucky he did n't break your neck for you ; because , if you think you could sue anybody in the courts yet , we got for witness Feinermann , Markulies and ourselves that you called him a liar and a thief . " " Nu , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred dollars and call it square . " " You would n't give me five hundred dollars , " Flaxberg shouted as he started for the door , " because I would sue you in the courts for five thousand dollars yet . " Flaxberg banged the door violently behind him , whereat Polatkin shrugged his shoulders . " Bluffs he is making it ! " he declared ; and forthwith he began to unfold plans for Elkan 's new campaign as city salesman . He had not proceeded very far , however , when there came another knock at the door . It was Sam Markulies . " Mr. Flaxberg says to me I should ask you if he should wait for the hundred dollars a check , or might you would mail it to him maybe ! " he said . Scheikowitz looked inquiringly at his partner . " Put on it , ' In full of all claims against Polatkin &amp; Scheikowitz or Elkan Lubliner to date , ' " he said . " And when you get through with that , Scheikowitz , write an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get busy on that Appenweier &amp; Murray order right away . " CHAPTER THREE A MATCH FOR ELKAN LUBLINER MADE IN HEAVEN , WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF MAX KAPFER " I would n't care if Elkan Lubliner was only eighteen even , " declared Morris Rashkind emphatically ; " he ai n't too young to marry B. Maslik 's a Tochter . There 's a feller which he has got in improved property alone , understand me , an equity of a hundred to a hundred and fifty thousand dollars ; and if you would count second mortgages and Bronix lots , Mr. Polatkin , the feller is worth easy his quarter of a million dollars . " " Sure I know , " Polatkin retorted . " With such a feller , he gives his daughter when she gets married five thousand dollars a second mortgage , understand me ; and the most the Chosan could expect is that some day he forecloses the mortgage and gets a deficiency judgment against a dummy bondsman which all his life he never got money enough to pay his laundry bills even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He says to me , so sure as you are sitting there , ' Mr. Rashkind , ' he says , ' my dear friend , ' he says , ' Birdie is my only Tochter . I ai n't got no other one , ' he says , ' Gott sei Dank , ' he says ; ' and the least I could do for her is five thousand dollars cash , ' he says , ' in a certified check , ' he says , ' before the feller goes under the Chuppah at all . ' " " With a feller like B. Maslik , " Polatkin commented , " it ai n't necessary for him to talk that way , Rashkind , because if he wants to get an up-to-date business man for his daughter , understand me , he could n't expect the feller is going to take chances on an uncertified check oder a promissory note . " " That 's all right , Mr. Polatkin , " Rashkind said . " B. Maslik 's promissory note is just so good as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't want his promissory note even . His word in the presence of a couple of bright , level-headed witnesses , which a lawyer could n't rattle ' em on the stand , verstehst du , would be good enough for me , Mr. Polatkin . B. Maslik , y'understand , is absolutely good like diamonds , Mr. Polatkin . " " All right , " Polatkin said . " I 'll speak to Elkan about it . He 'll be back from the road Saturday . " " Speak nothing , " Rashkind cried excitedly . " Saturday would be too late . Everybody is working on this here proposition , Mr. Polatkin . Because the way property is so dead nowadays all the real estaters tries to be a Shadchen , understand me ; so if you would n't want Miss Maslik to slip through Elkan 's fingers , write him this afternoon yet . I got a fountain pen right here . " As he spoke he produced a fountain pen of formidable dimensions and handed it to Polatkin . " I 'll take the letter along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marcus made a preliminary flourish . " Tell him , " Rashkind went on , " that the girl is something which you could really call beautiful . " " I would n't tell him nothing of the sort , " Polatkin said , " because , in the first place , what for a Schreiber you think I am anyway ? And , in the second place , Rashkind , Elkan is so full of business , understand me , if I would write him to come home on account this here Miss Maslik is such a good-looker he would n't come at all . " Rashkind shrugged . " Go ahead , " he said . " Do it your own way . " For more than five minutes Polatkin indited his message to Elkan and at last he inclosed it in an envelope . " How would you spell Bridgetown ? " he asked . " Which Bridgetown ? " Rashkind inquired  --  " Bridgetown , Pennsylvania , oder Bridgetown , Illinois ? " " What difference does that make ? " Polatkin demanded . " About the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied . " Bridgetown is spelt B-r-i-d-g-e-t-a-u-n , all the world over ; aber if it 's Bridgetown , Pennsylvania , that 's a very funny quincidence , on account I am just now talking to a feller which formerly keeps a store there by the name Flixman . " " Do you mean Julius Flixman ? " Marcus asked as he licked the envelope . " That 's the feller , " Rashkind said with a sigh as he pocketed the letter to Elkan . " It 's a funny world , Mr. Polatkin . Him and me comes over together in one steamer yet , thirty years ago ; and to-day if that feller 's worth a cent he 's worth fifty thousand dollars . " " Sure , I know , " Marcus agreed ; " and Gott soll hueten you and I should got what he 's got it . He could drop down in the streets any moment , Rashkind . " Rashkind nodded as he rose to his feet . " In a way , it 's his own fault , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round in taxicabs yet ai n't got no business walking the streets in his condition . I told him this morning : ' Julius , ' I says , ' if I was one of your heirs , ' I says to him , ' I would n't want nothing better as to see you hanging round the real-estate exchange , looking the way you look ! ' And he says to me : ' Rashkind , ' he says , ' there is a whole lot worser things I could wish myself as you should be my heir , ' he says . ' On account , ' he says , ' if a Schlemiel like you would got a relation which is going to leave you money , Rashkind , ' he says , ' it would be just your luck that the relation dies one day after you do , even if you would live to be a hundred . ' " He walked toward the door and paused on the threshold . " Yes , Mr. Polatkin , " he concluded , " you could take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Polatkin , it ai n't from overworking it . So I would ring you up to-morrow afternoon three o'clock and see if Elkan 's come yet . " " I 'm agreeable , " Polatkin declared ; " only one thing I got to ask you : you should keep your mouth shut to my partner , on account if he hears it that I am bringing back Elkan from the road just for this here Miss Maslik , understand me , he would never let me hear the end of it . " Rashkind made a reassuring gesture with his right arm after the fashion of a swimmer who employs the overhand stroke . " What have I got to do with your partner ? " he said as he started for the elevator . " If I meet him in the place , I am selling buttons and you do n't want to buy none . Ai n't it ? " Polatkin nodded and turned to the examination of a pile of monthly statements by way of dismissing the marriage broker . Moreover , he felt impelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he might have it pat upon the return from lunch of his partner , Philip Scheikowitz , who at that precise moment was seated in the rear of Wasserbauer 's cafe , by the side of Charles Fischko . " Yes , Mr. Scheikowitz , " Fischko said , " if you would really got the feller 's interest in heart , understand me , you would n't wait till Saturday at all . Write him to-day yet , because this proposition is something which you could really call remarkable , on account most girls which they got five thousand dollars dowries , Mr. Scheikowitz , ai n't got five-thousand-dollar faces ; aber this here Miss Maslik is something which when you are paying seventy-five cents a seat on theaytre , understand me , you do n't see such an elegant-looking Gesicht . She 's a regular doll , Mr. Scheikowitz ! " " Sure , I know , " Scheikowitz agreed ; " that 's the way it is with them dolls , Fischko  --  takes a fortune already to dress ' em . " Fischko flapped the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are making a big mistake , " he declared . " The Masliks got living in the house with ' em a girl which for years already she makes all Miss Maslik 's dresses and Mrs. Maslik 's also . B. Maslik told me so himself , Mr. Scheikowitz . He says to me : ' Fischko , ' he says , ' my Birdie is a girl which she ai n't accustomed she should got a lot of money spent on her , ' he says ; ' the five thousand dollars is practically net , ' he says , ' on account his expenses would be small . ' " " Is she a good cook ? " Scheikowitz asked . " A good cook ! " Fischko cried . " Listen here to me , Mr. Scheikowitz . You know that a Shadchen eats sometimes in pretty swell houses . Ai n't it ? " Scheikowitz nodded . " Well , I am telling you , Mr. Scheikowitz , so sure as I am sitting here , that I got in B. Maslik 's last Tuesday a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Scheikowitz , which honestly , if you would go to Delmonico 's oder the Waldorfer , understand me , you could pay as high as fifty cents for it , Mr. Scheikowitz , and it would n't be  --  I am not saying better  --  but so good even as that there gefuellte Hechte which I got it by B. Maslik . " Scheikowitz nodded again . " All right , Fischko , " he said , " I will write the boy so soon as I get back to the office yet ; but one thing I must beg of you : do n't say a word about this to my partner , y'understand , because if he would hear that I am bringing home Elkan from the road just on account of this Shidduch you are proposing , understand me , he would make my life miserable . " Fischko shrugged his shoulders until his head nearly disappeared into his chest . " What would I talk to your partner for , Mr. Scheikowitz ? " he said . " I am looking to you in this here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-morrow afternoon , Mr. Scheikowitz , and if your partner asks me something a question , I would tell him I am selling thread oder buttons . " " Make it buttons , " Scheikowitz commented , as he rose to his feet ; " because we never buy buttons from nobody but the Prudential Button Company . " On his way back to his office Scheikowitz pondered a variety of reasons for writing Elkan to return , and he had tentatively adopted the most extravagant one when , within a hundred feet of his business premises , he encountered no less a personage than Julius Flixman . " Wie geht 's , Mr. Flixman ? " he cried . " What brings you to New York ? " Flixman saluted Philip with a limp handclasp . " I am living here now , " he said . " I am giving up my store in Bridgetown schon six months ago already , on account I enjoyed such poor health there . So I sold out to a young feller by the name Max Kapfer , which was for years working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , as I told you . " " With relations maybe ? " Philip asked . " Yow , relations ! " Flixman replied . " I used to got one sister living in Bessarabia , Mr. Scheikowitz , and I ai n't heard from her in more as thirty years , and I guess she is dead all right by this time . I am living at a hotel which I could assure you the prices they soak me is something terrible . " " And what are you doing round this neighborhood , Mr. Flixman ? " Philip continued by way of making conversation . " I was just over to see a lawyer over on Center Street , " Flixman replied . " A lawyer on Center Street ! " Philip exclaimed . " A rich man like you should got a lawyer on Wall Street , Mr. Flixman . Henry D. Feldman is our lawyer , and  --   --  " " Do n't mention that sucker to me ! " Flixman interrupted . " Actually the feller is got the nerve to ask me a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Center Street wants only fifty . I bet yer if I would go round there to-morrow or the next day he takes twenty-five even . " " But a will is something which is really important , Mr. Flixman . " " Not to me it ai n't , Scheikowitz , because , while I could n't take my money with me , Scheikowitz , I ai n't got no one to leave it to ; so , if I would n't make a will it goes to the state  --  ai n't it ? " " Maybe , " Philip commented . " So I am leaving it to a Talmud Torah School , which it certainly do n't do no harm that all them young loafers over on the East Side should learn a little Loschen Hakodesch . Ai n't it ? " " Sure not , " Philip said . " Well , " Flixman concluded as he took a firmer grasp on his cane preparatory to departing , " that 's the way it goes . If I would got children to leave my money to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred dollars . ' But for a Talmud Torah School I would see ' em all dead first before I would pay fifty even . " He nodded savagely in farewell and shuffled off down the street , while Philip made his way toward the factory , with his half-formed excuse to his partner now entirely forgotten . He tried in vain to recall it when he entered his office a few minutes later , but the sight of his partner spurred him to action and immediately he devised a new and better plan . " Marcus , " he said , " write Elkan at once he should come back to the store . I just seen Flixman on the street and he tells me he 's got a young feller by the name Karpfer oder Kapfer now running his store ; and , " he continued in an access of inspiration , " the stock is awful run down there ; so , if Elkan goes right back to Bridgetown with a line of low-priced goods he could do a big business with Kapfer . " Polatkin had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly good excuse for his letter , and he had intended to lend it color by prefacing it with an abusive dissertation on " Wasting the Whole Afternoon over Lunch " ; but Scheikowitz ' greeting completely disarmed him . His jaw dropped and he gazed stupidly at his partner . " What 's the matter ? " Scheikowitz cried . " Is it so strange we should bring Elkan back here for the chance of doing some more business ? Three dollars carfare between here and Bridgetown would n't make or break us , Polatkin . " " Sure ! Sure ! " Marcus said at last . " I would  --  now  --  write him as soon as I get back from lunch . " " Write him right away ! " Scheikowitz insisted ; and , though Marcus had breakfasted before seven that morning and it was then half-past two , he turned to his desk without further parley . There , for the second time that day , he penned a letter to Elkan ; and , after exhibiting it to his partner , he inclosed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of Wasserbauer 's cafe and , taking the missive from his pocket , tore it into small pieces and cast it into the gutter . * * * * * " I suppose , Elkan , you are wondering why we wrote you to come home from Bridgetown when you would be back on Saturday anyway , " Scheikowitz began as Elkan laid down his suitcase in the firm 's office the following afternoon . " Naturally , " Elkan replied . " I had an appointment for this morning to see a feller there , which we could open maybe a good account ; a feller by the name Max Kapfer . " " Max Kapfer ? " Polatkin and Scheikowitz exclaimed with one voice . " That 's what I said , " Elkan repeated . " And in order I should n't lose the chance I got him to promise he would come down here this afternoon yet on a late train and we would pay his expenses . " " Do you mean Max Kapfer , the feller which took over Flixman 's store ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kapfer in Bridgetown , " Elkan replied , and Polatkin immediately assumed a pose of righteous indignation . " That 's from yours an idee , Scheikowitz , " he said . " Not only you make the boy trouble to come back to the store , but we also got to give this feller Kapfer his expenses yet . " " What are you kicking about ? " Scheikowitz demanded . " You seemed agreeable to the proposition yesterday . " " I got to seem agreeable , " Polatkin retorted as he started for the door of the factory , " otherwise it would be nothing but fight , fight , fight mit you , day in , day out . " He paused at the entrance and winked solemnly at Elkan . " I am sick and tired of it , " he concluded as he supplemented the wink with a significant frown , and when he passed into the factory Elkan followed him . " What 's the matter now ? " Elkan asked anxiously . " I want to speak to you a few words something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scheikowitz entered the factory . " Did you got your lunch on the train , Elkan ? " Scheikowitz said ; " because , if not , come on out and we 'll have a cup coffee together . " " Leave the boy alone , ca n't you ? " Polatkin exclaimed . " I 'll go right out with you , Mr. Scheikowitz , " Elkan said as he edged away to the rear of the factory . " Go and put on your hat and I 'll be with you in a minute . " When Scheikowitz had reentered the office Elkan turned to Marcus Polatkin . " You ai n't scrapping again , " he said , " are you ? " " Oser a Stueck , " Polatkin answered . " We are friendly like lambs ; but listen here to me , Elkan . I ai n't got no time before he 'll be back again , so I 'll tell you . As a matter of fact , it was me that wrote you to come back , really . I got an elegant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclaimed . " For me ? " " Sure , " Polatkin whispered . " A fine-looking girl by the name Birdie Maslik , mit five thousand dollars . Do n't say nothing to Scheikowitz about it . " " But , " Elkan said , " I ai n't looking for no Shidduch . " " S-ssh ! " Polatkin hissed . " Her father is B. Maslik , the ' Pants King . ' To-morrow night you are going up to see her mit Rashkind , the Shadchen . " " What the devil you are talking about ? " Elkan asked . " Not a word , " Polatkin whispered out of one corner of his mouth . " Here comes Scheikowitz  --  and remember , do n't say nothing to him about it . Y'understand ? " Elkan nodded reluctantly as Scheikowitz reappeared from the office . " Nu , Elkan , " Scheikowitz demanded , " are you coming ? " " Right away , " Elkan said , and together they proceeded downstairs . " Well , Elkan , " Scheikowitz began when they reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send for you just on account of this here Kapfer . Ai n't it ? " Elkan shrugged in reply . " But , as a matter of fact , " Scheikowitz continued , " Kapfer ai n't got no more to do with it than Elia Hanove ; and , even though Polatkin would be such a crank that I was afraid for my life to suggest a thing , it was my idee you should come home , Elkan , because in a case like this delays is dangerous . " " Mr. Scheikowitz , " Elkan pleaded , " do me the favour and do n't go beating bushes round . What are you trying to drive into ? " " I am trying to drive into this , Elkan , " Scheikowitz replied : " I have got for you an elegant Shidduch . " " Shidduch ! " Elkan exclaimed . " For me ? Why , Mr. Scheikowitz , I do n't want no Shidduch yet a while ; and anyhow , Mr. Scheikowitz , if I would get married I would be my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scheikowitz exclaimed . " A feller which is his own Shadchen remains single all his life long . " " That suits me all right , " Elkan commented as they reached Wasserbauer 's . " I would remain single und fertig . " " What d'ye mean , you would remain single ? " Scheikowitz cried . " Is some one willing to pay you five thousand dollars you should remain single , Elkan ? Oser a Stueck , Elkan ; and , furthermore , this here Miss Birdie Maslik is got such a face , Elkan , which , honest , if she would n't have a cent to her name , understand me , you would say she is beautiful anyhow . " " Miss Birdie Maslik ! " Elkan murmured . " B. Maslik 's a Tochter , " Scheikowitz added ; " and remember , Elkan , do n't breathe a word of this to Polatkin , otherwise he would never get through talking about it . Moreover , you will go up to Maslik 's house to-morrow night with Charles Fischko , the Shadchen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Elkan protested . " I ai n't going nowheres with no Shadchen  --  and that 's all there is to it . " " Aber , Elkan , " Scheikowitz said , " this here Fischko ai n't a Shadchen exactly . He 's really a real-estater , aber real estate is so dead nowadays the feller must got to make a living somehow ; so it ai n't like you would be going somewheres mit a Shadchen , Elkan . Actually you are going somewheres mit a real-estater . Ai n't it ? " " It do n't make no difference , " Elkan answered stubbornly . " If I would go and see a girl I would go alone , otherwise not at all . So , if you insist on it I should go and see this here Miss Maslik to-morrow night , Mr. Scheikowitz , I would do so , but not with Rashkind . " " Fischko , " Scheikowitz interrupted . " Fischko oder Rashkind , " Elkan said  --  " that 's all there is to it . And if I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go up to the Prince Clarence and meet Max Kapfer ; so you would excuse me if I skip . " " Think it over Elkan , " Scheikowitz called after him as Elkan left the cafe , and three quarters of an hour later he entered Polatkin &amp; Scheikowitz ' showroom accompanied by a fashionably attired young man . " Mr. Polatkin , " Elkan said , " shake hands with Mr. Kapfer . " " How do you do , Mr. Kapfer ? " Polatkin cried . " This here is my partner , Philip Scheikowitz . " " How do you do , Mr. Scheikowitz ? " Kapfer said . " You are very conveniently located here . Right in the heart of things , so to speak . I see across the street is Bleimauer &amp; Gittelmann . Them people was in to see me last week already and offered me a big bargain in velvet suits , but I was all stocked up along that line so I did n't hand them no orders . " " Velvet suits ai n't our specialty at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we never seen a velvet suit in all our lives , Mr. Kapfer , we could work you up a line of velvet suits which would make them velvet suits of Bleimauer &amp; Gittelmann look like a bundle of rags . " " I do n't doubt it , " Kapfer rejoined ; " but , as I said before , velvet suits I am all stocked up in , as I could n't afford to carry very many of ' em . " " That 's all right , " Polatkin said as he led the way to the showroom . " We got a line of garments here , Mr. Kapfer , which includes all prices and styles . " He handed Max a large mild cigar as he spoke . " So let 's see if we could n't suit you , " he concluded . For more than two hours Max Kapfer examined Polatkin &amp; Scheikowitz ' sample line and made so judicious a selection of moderate-priced garments that Polatkin could not forbear expressing his admiration , albeit the total amount of the purchase was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Kapfer , " he said . " Them styles is really the best value we got . " " I know it , " Kapfer agreed . " I was ten years with Paschalson , of Sarahcuse , Mr. Polatkin , and what I do n't know about a popular-price line of ladies ' ready-to-wear garments , underwear and millinery , Paschalson could n't learn me . But that ai n't what I 'm after , Mr. Polatkin . I 'd like to do some high-price business too . If I had the capital I would improve my store building and put in new fixtures , understand me , and I could increase my business seventy-five per cent and carry a better class of goods too . " " Sure , I know , " Polatkin said as they returned to the office . " Everybody needs more capital , Mr. Kapfer . We ourselves could do with a few thousand dollars more . " He looked significantly at Elkan , who colored slightly as he recognized the allusion . " I bet yer , " Scheikowitz added fervently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also . " He nodded almost imperceptibly at Elkan , who forthwith broke into a gentle perspiration . " Five thousand was just the figure I was thinking of myself , " Kapfer said . " With five thousand dollars I could do wonders in Bridgetown , Mr. Scheikowitz . " " I 'm surprised Flixman do n't help you out a bit , " Elkan suggested by way of changing the subject , and Kapfer emitted a mirthless laugh . " That bloodsucker ! " he said . " What , when I bought his store , Mr. Scheikowitz , he took from me in part payment notes at two , four , and six months ; and , though I got the cash ready to pay him the last note , which it falls due this week already , I asked him he should give me two months an extension , on account I want to put in a few fixtures on the second floor . Do you think that feller would do it ? He 's got a heart like a rock , Mr. Polatkin ; and any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blast it out of him with dynamite yet . " Polatkin nodded solemnly . " You could n't tell me nothing about Flixman , " he said as he offered Kapfer a consolatory cigar . " It 's wasting your lungs to talk about such a feller at all ; so let 's go ahead and finish up this order , Mr. Kapfer , and afterward Elkan would go uptown with you . " He motioned Kapfer to a seat and then looked at his watch . " I did n't got no idee it was so late , " he said . " Scheikowitz , do me the favor and go over Mr. Kapfer 's order with him while I give a look outside and see what 's doing in the shop . " As he walked toward the door he jerked his head sideways at Elkan , who a moment later followed him into the factory . " Listen , Elkan , " he began . " While you and Scheikowitz was out for your coffee , Rashkind rings me up and says you should meet him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue to-night  --  not to-morrow night  --  at eight o'clock sure . " " But Kapfer ai n't going back to Bridgetown to-night , " Elkan protested . " He told me so himself on account he is got still to buy underwear , millinery and shoes . " " What is that our business ? " Polatkin asked . " He 's already bought from us all he 's going to ; so , if he stays here , let them underwear and millinery people entertain him . Blow him to dinner and that would be plenty . " Once more Elkan shrugged despairingly . " You did n't say nothing to Scheikowitz about it , did you ? " Polatkin inquired . " Sure I did n't say nothing to him about it , " Elkan said ; " because  --   --  " " Elkan , " Scheikowitz called from the office , " Mr. Kapfer is waiting for you . " Elkan had been about to disclose the conversation between himself and Scheikowitz at Wasserbauer 's that afternoon , but Marcus , at the appearance of his partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus , when Elkan accompanied Max Kapfer uptown that evening , his manner was so preoccupied by reason of his dilemma that Kapfer was constrained to comment on it . * * * * * " What 's worrying you , Lubliner ? " he asked as they seated themselves in the cafe of the Prince Clarence . " You look like you was figuring out the interest on the money you owe . " " I 'll tell you the truth , Mr. Kapfer , " Elkan began , " I would like to ask you an advice about something . " " Go as far as you like , " Kapfer replied . " It do n't make no difference if a feller would be broke oder in jail , he could always give somebody advice . " " Well , it 's like this , " Elkan said , and forthwith he unfolded the circumstances attending his return from Bridgetown . " Nu ! " Kapfer commented when Elkan concluded his narrative . " What is that for something to worry about ? " " But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In the first place , I got lots of time to get married , on account I am only twenty-one , Mr. Kapfer ; and though a feller could n't start in too early in business , Mr. Kapfer , getting married is something else again . To my mind a feller should be anyhow twenty-five before he jumps right in and gets married . " " With some people , yes , and others , no , " Kapfer rejoined . " And in the second place , " Elkan went on , " I do n't like this here Shadchen business . We are living in America , not Russland ; and in America if a feller gets married he do n't need no help from a Shadchen , Mr. Kapfer . " " No , " Kapfer said , " he do n't need no help , Lubliner ; but , just the same , if some one would come to me any time these five years and says to me , here is something a nice girl , understand me , with five thousand dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since already . " He cleared his throat judicially and sat back in his chair until it rested against the wall . " The fact is , Lubliner , " he said , " you are acting like a fool . What harm would it do supposing you would go up there to-night with this here Rashkind ? " " What , and go there to-morrow night with Fischko ! " Elkan exclaimed . " Besides , if I would go up there to-night with Rashkind and the deal is closed , understand me , might Fischko would sue Mr. Scheikowitz in the court yet . " " Not at all , " Kapfer declared . " Fischko could n't sue nobody but B. Maslik ; so never mind waiting here for dinner . Hustle uptown and keep your date with Rashkind . " He shook Elkan by the hand . " Good luck to you , Lubliner , " he concluded heartily ; " and if you got the time stop in on your way down to-morrow morning and let me know how you come out . " * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of One Hundred and Twentieth Street and Lenox Avenue that evening , it might well be supposed that he would have difficulty in recognizing Mr. Rashkind , since neither he nor Rashkind had any previous acquaintance . However , he accosted without hesitation a short , stout person arrayed in a wrinkled frock coat and wearing the white tie and gold spectacles that invariably garb the members of such quasi-clerical professions as a Shadchen , a sexton or the collector of subscriptions for a charitable institution . Indeed , as Rashkind combined all three of these callings with the occupation of a real-estate broker , he also sported a high silk hat of uncertain vintage and a watch-chain bearing a Masonic emblem approximating in weight and size a tailor 's goose . " This is Mr. Rashkind , ai n't it ? " Elkan asked , and Rashkind bowed solemnly . " My name is Mr. Lubliner , " Elkan continued , " and Mr. Polatkin says you would be here at eight . " For answer Mr. Rashkind drew from his waistcoat pocket what appeared to be a six-ounce boxing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering of his gold watch , the gift of Rambam Lodge , No. 142 , I. O. M. A. This Mr. Rashkind consulted with knit brows . " That 's right , " he said , returning the watch and its covering to his pocket  --  " eight o'clock to the minute ; so I guess we would just so well go round to B. Maslik 's house if you ai n't got no objections . " " I 'm agreeable , " Elkan said ; " but , before we start , you should please be so good and tell me what I must got to do . " " What you must got to do ? " Rashkind exclaimed . " A question ! You must n't got to do nothing . Act natural and leave the rest to me . " " But , " Elkan insisted as they proceeded down Lenox Avenue , " should n't I say something to the girl ? " " Sure , you should say something to the girl , " Rashkind replied ; " but , if you could n't find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all I could tell you is you 're a bigger Schlemiel than you look . " With this encouraging ultimatum , Mr. Rashkind entered the portals of a hallway that glittered with lacquered bronze and plaster porphyry , and before Elkan had time to ask any more questions he found himself seated with Mr. Rashkind in the front parlour of a large apartment on the seventh floor . " Mr. Maslik says you should be so good and step into the dining room , " the maid said to Mr. Rashkind . Forthwith he rose to his feet and left Elkan alone in the room , save for the presence of the maid , who drew down the shades and smiled encouragingly on Elkan . " Ai n't it a fine weather ? " she asked . Elkan looked up , and he could not resist smiling in return . " Elegant , " he replied . " It do n't seem like summer was ever going to quit . " " It could n't last too long for me , " the maid continued . " Might some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to going up on the roof , understand me , and hanging out a big wash , the summer is good enough for me . " Elkan gazed for a moment at her oval face , with its kindly , intelligent brown eyes . " You mean to say you got to do washing here ? " he asked in shocked accents . " Sure I do , " she replied ; " aber this winter I am going to night school again and next summer might I would get a job as bookkeeper maybe . " " But why do n't you get a job in a store somewheres ? " he asked . " I see myself working in a store all day , standing on my feet yet , and when I get through all my wages goes for board ! " she replied . " Whereas , here I got anyhow a good room and board , and all what I earn I could put away in savings bank . I worked in a store long enough , Mr.  --   --  " " Lubliner , " Elkan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could assure you I would a whole lot sooner do housework , " she went on . " Why should a girl think it 's a disgrace she should do housework for a living is more as I could tell you . Sooner or later a girl gets married , and then she must got to do her own housework . " " Not if her husband makes a good living , " Elkan suggested . " Sure , I know , " she rejoined ; " but how many girls which they are working in stores gets not a rich man , understand me , but a man which is only making , say , for example , thirty dollars a week . The most that a poor girl expects is that she marries a poor man , y'understand , and then they work their way up together . " Elkan nodded . Unconsciously he was indorsing not so much the matter as the manner of her conversation , for she spoke with the low voice that distinguishes the Rumanian from the Pole or Lithuanian . " You are coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Pretty near there , " the maid replied . " Right on the border . I am coming here an orphan five years ago ; and  --   --  " " Nu , Lubliner , " cried a rasping voice from the doorway , " we got our appointment for nothing  --  Miss Maslik is sick . " " That 's too bad , " Elkan said perfunctorily . " Only a little something she eats gives her a headache , " Rashkind went on . " We could come round the day after to-morrow night . " " That 's too bad also , " Elkan commented , " on account the day after to-morrow night I got a date with a customer . " " Well , anyhow , B. Maslik would be in in a minute and  --   --  " Elkan rose to his feet so abruptly that he nearly sent his chair through a cabinet behind him . " If I want to be here Friday night , " he said , " I must see my customer to-night yet ; so , young lady , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't wait , but would be here Friday night with this here  --  now  --  gentleman . Come on , Rashkind . " He started for the hall door almost on a run , with Rashkind gesticulating excitedly behind him ; but , before the Shadchen could even grasp his coattails he had let himself hurriedly out and was taking the stairs three at a jump . " Hey ! " Rashkind shouted as he plunged down the steps after Elkan . " What 's the matter with you ? Do n't you want to meet Mr. Maslik ? " Elkan only hurried the faster , however , for in the few minutes he had been alone in the room with the little brown-eyed maid he had made the discovery that marriage with the aid of a Shadchen was impossible for him . Simultaneously he conceived the notion that marriage without the aid of a Shadchen might after all be well worth trying ; and , as this idea loomed in his mind , his pace slackened until the Shadchen overtook him at the corner of One Hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rashkind said . " What is the matter with you anyway ? " Elkan professed to misunderstand the question . " I 've lost my address book , " he said . " I had it in my hand when you left me alone there and I must of forgotten it ; so I guess I 'll go back and get it . " " All right , " Rashkind replied . " I 'll go with you . " Elkan wheeled round and glared viciously at the Shadchen . " You 'll do nothing of the kind ! " he roared . " You get right down them subway steps or I would n't come up with you Friday night . " " But what harm  --   --  " Rashkind began , when Elkan seized him by the shoulder and led him firmly downstairs to the ticket office . There Elkan bought a ticket and , dropping it in the chopper 's box , he pushed Rashkind on to the platform . A few minutes later a downtown express bore the Shadchen away and Elkan ascended the stairs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for B. Maslik 's apartment house , where , by the simple expedient of handing the elevator boy a quarter , he averted the formality of being announced . Thus , when he rang the doorbell of B. Maslik 's flat , though it was opened by the little brown-eyed maid in person , she had discarded the white apron and cap that she had worn a few minutes before , and her hair was fluffed up in becoming disorder . " You was telling me you are coming originally from somewheres near Rumania , " Elkan began without further preface , " and  --  why , what 's the matter ? You 've been crying ? " She put her fingers to her lips and closed the door softly behind her . " They says I did n't got no business talking to you at all , " she replied , " and they called me down something terrible ! " Elkan 's eyes flashed angrily . " Who calls you down ? " he demanded . " Mr. and Mrs. Maslik , " she answered ; " and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She struggled bravely to retain her composure ; but just one little half-strangled sob escaped her , and forthwith Elkan felt internally a peculiar sinking sensation . " What do they mean you ai n't got no shame ? " he protested . " I got a right to talk to you and you got a right to talk to me  --  ai n't it ? " She nodded and sobbed again , whereat Elkan winced and dug his nails into the palms of his hands . " Listen ! " he pleaded . " Do n't worry yourself at all . After this I would n't got no use for them people . I did n't come here on my own account in the first place , but  --   --  " Here he paused . " But what ? " the little maid asked . " But I 'm glad I came now , " Elkan went on defiantly , " and I do n't care who knows it . Wir sind alles Jehudim , anyhow , and one is just as good as the other . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. Maslik in the old country ? He could over sign his name when he came here , while I am anyhow from decent , respectable people , Mr. Lubliner . " " I do n't doubt it , " Elkan replied . " My father was a learned man , Mr. Lubliner ; but that do n't save him . One day he goes to Kishinef on business , Mr. Lubliner , and  --   --  " Here her composure entirely forsook her and she covered her face with her hands and wept . Elkan struggled with himself no longer . He took the little maid in his arms ; and , as it seemed the most natural thing in the world to do , she laid her head against his shoulder and had her whole cry out . Elkan spoke no word , but patted her shoulder gently with his right hand . " I guess I 'm acting like a baby , Mr. Lubliner , " she said , after a quarter of an hour had elapsed . To Elkan it seemed like an acquaintance of many months as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elkan , Liebchen , " he said , " and we would send all the heavy washing out . " * * * * * " Well , Lubliner , " Kapfer cried as Elkan came into the cafe of the Prince Clarence the following morning , " you did n't like her  --  what ? " " Did n't like her ! " Elkan exclaimed . " What d'ye mean I did n't like her ? " " Why , the way you look , I take it you had a pretty rotten time last night , " Kapfer rejoined . " What are you talking about  --  rotten time ? " Elkan protested . " The only thing is I feel so happy I did n't sleep a wink , that 's all . " Kapfer jumped to his feet and slapped Elkan on the shoulder . " Do you mean you 're engaged ! " he asked . " Sure ! " Elkan replied . " Then I congradulate you a thousand times , " Kapfer said gleefully . " Once is plenty , " Elkan replied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You should got to be congradulated more as you think , because this morning I am talking to a feller in the clothing business here and he says B. Maslik is richer as most people believe . The feller says he is easy worth a quarter of a million dollars . " " What 's that got to do with it ? " Elkan asked . " What 's that got to do with it ? " Kapfer repeated . " Why , it 's got everything to do with it , considering you are engaged to his only daughter . " " I am engaged to his only daughter ? Who told you that , Mr. Kapfer ? " " Why , you did ! " Kapfer said . " I never said nothing of the kind , " Elkan declared , " because I ai n't engaged to Miss Maslik at all ; in fact , I never even seen her . " Kapfer gazed earnestly at Elkan and then sat down suddenly . " Say , lookyhere , Lubliner , " he said . " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are going up with a Shadchen to see Birdie Maslik , and now you tell me you are engaged , but not to Miss Maslik . " " That 's right , " Elkan replied . " Then who in thunder are you engaged to ? " " That 's just the point , " Elkan said , as he passed his hand through his hair . " I ai n't slept a wink all night on account of it ; in fact , this morning I wondered should I go round there and ask  --  and then I thought to myself I would get from you an advice first . " " Get from me an advice ! " Kapfer exclaimed . " You mean you are engaged to a girl and you do n't know her name , and so you come down here to ask me an advice as to how you should find out her name ? " Elkan nodded sadly and leaned his elbow on the table . " It 's like this , " he said ; and for more than half an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descriptive and irrelevant material concerning Elkan 's own feelings in the matter , ought to have taken only five minutes in the telling . " And that 's the way it is , Mr. Kapfer , " Elkan concluded . " I do n't know her name ; but a poor little girl like her , which she is so good  --  and so  --  and so  --   --  " Here he became all choked up and Kapfer handed him a cigar . " Do n't go into that again , Lubliner , " Kapfer said ; " you told me how good she is six times already . The point is you are in a hole and you want me I should help you out  --  ai n't it ? " Elkan nodded wearily . " Well , then , my advice to you is : Stiegen , " Kapfer continued . " Do n't say a word about this to nobody until you would , anyhow , find out the girl 's name . " " I was n't going to , " Elkan replied ; " but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet this here other Shadchen by the name Fischko , who is going to take me up to Maslik 's house . " " But I thought Miss Maslik was sick , " Kapfer said . " She was sick , " Elkan answered , " but she would be better by to-night . So that 's the way it stands . If I would go downtown now and explain to Mr. Scheikowitz that I am not going up there to-night and that I was there last night  --  and  --   --  " Here Elkan paused and made an expressive gesture with both hands . " The fact is , " he almost whimpered , " the whole thing is such a Mischmasch I feel like I was going crazy ! " Kapfer leaned across the table and patted him consolingly on the arm . " Do n't make yourself sick over it , " he advised . " Put it up to Polatkin . You do n't got to keep Scheikowitz 's idee a secret now , Lubliner , because sooner or later Polatkin must got to find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was up there last night , and that Rashkind wants you to go up there Friday night on account Miss Maslik was sick , and leave it to Polatkin to flag Scheikowitz and this here Fischko . " " But  --   --  " Elkan began , when the strange expression of Kapfer 's face made him pause . Indeed , before he could proceed further , Kapfer jumped up from his chair . " Cheese it ! " he said . " Here comes Polatkin . " As he spoke , Polatkin caught sight of them and almost ran across the room . " Elkan ! " he exclaimed . " Gott sei Dank I found you here . " " What 's the matter ? " Elkan asked . Polatkin drew forward a chair and they all sat down . " I just had a terrible fuss with Scheikowitz , " he said . " This morning , when I got downtown , I thought I would tell him what I brought you back for ; so I says to him : ' Philip , ' I says , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' I got an elegant Shidduch for Elkan . ' " He stopped and let his hand fall with a loud smack on his thigh . " Oo-ee ! " he exclaimed . " What a row that feller made it ! You would think , Elkan , I told him I got a pistol to shoot you with , the way he acts . I did n't even got the opportunity to tell him who the Shidduch was . He tells me I should mind my own business and calls me such names which honestly I would n't call a shipping clerk even . And what else d'ye think he says ? " Elkan and Kapfer shook their heads . " Why , he says that to-night , at eight o'clock , he himself is going to have a Shadchen by the name Fischko take you up to see a girl in Harlem which the name he did n't tell me at all ; but he says she 's got five thousand dollars a dowry . Did he say to you anything about it , Elkan ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in husky tones as he averted his eyes from Polatkin . " Why , I would n't know the feller Fischko if he stood before me now , and he would n't know me neither . " " Did n't he tell you her name ? " Kapfer asked cautiously . " No , " Polatkin replied , " because I says right away that the girl I had in mind would got a dowry of five thousand too ; and then and there Scheikowitz gets so mad he smashes a chair on us  --  one of them new ones we just bought , Elkan . So I did n't say nothing more , but I rung up Rashkind right away and asks him how things turns out , and he says nothing is settled yet . " Elkan nodded guiltily . " So I got an idee , " Polatkin continued . " I thought , Elkan , we would do this : Do n't come downtown to-day at all , and to-night I would go up and meet Fischko and tell him you are practically engaged and the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ten-dollar bill he should n't bother us again . " Elkan grasped the edge of the table . He felt as if consciousness were slipping away from him , when suddenly Kapfer emitted a loud exclamation . " By jiminy ! " he cried . " I got an idee ! Why should n't I go up there and meet this here Fischko ? " " You go up there ? " Polatkin said . " Sure ; why not ? A nice girl like Miss  --  whatever her name is  --  ai n't too good for me , Mr. Polatkin . I got a good business there in Bridgetown , and  --   --  " " But I do n't know what for a girl she is at all , " Polatkin protested . " She 's got anyhow five thousand dollars , " Kapfer retorted , " and when a girl 's got five thousand dollars , Mr. Polatkin , beauty ai n't even skin-deep . " " Sure , I know , " Polatkin agreed ; " but so soon as you see Fischko and tell him you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round to see the girl at all . " " Leave that to me , " Kapfer declared . " D'ye know what I 'll tell him ? " He looked hard at Elkan Lubliner before he continued . " I 'll tell him , " he said , " that Elkan is already engaged . " " Already engaged ! " Polatkin cried . " Sure ! " Kapfer said  --  " secretly engaged unbeknownst to everybody . " " But right away to-morrow morning Fischko would come down and tell Scheikowitz that you says Elkan is secretly engaged , and Scheikowitz would know the whole thing was a fake and that I am at the bottom of it . " " No , he would n't , " Kapfer rejoined , " because Elkan would then and there say that he is secretly engaged and that would let you out . " " Sure it would , " Polatkin agreed ; " and then Scheikowitz would want to kill Elkan . " Suddenly Elkan struck the table with his clenched fist . " I 've got the idee ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till Saturday  --  because we will say , for example , I am sick . Then , when Fischko says I am secretly engaged , you can say you do n't know nothing about it ; and by the time I come down on Saturday morning I would be engaged all right , and nobody could do nothing any more . " " That 's true too , " Kapfer said , " because your date with Rashkind is for to-morrow night and by Saturday the whole thing would be over . " Polatkin nodded doubtfully , but after a quarter of an hour 's earnest discussion he was convinced of the wisdom of Elkan 's plan . " All right , Elkan , " he said at last . " Be down early on Saturday . " " Eight o'clock sure , " Elkan replied as he shook Polatkin 's hand ; " and by that time I hope you 'll congratulate me on my engagement . " " I hope so , " Polatkin said . " Me too , " Kapfer added after Polatkin departed ; " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning to you that the next time you get engaged you should find out the girl 's name in advance . " * * * * * " Yes , siree , sir , " said Charles Fischko emphatically , albeit a trifle thickly . " I guess you made a big hit there , Mr. Kapfer , and I do n't think I am acting previously when I drink to the health of Mrs. Kapfer . " He touched glasses with Max Kapfer , who sat opposite to him at a secluded table in the Harlem Winter Garden , flanked by two bottles of what had been a choice brand of California champagne . " Nee Miss Maslik , " he added as he put down his glass ; " and I think you are getting a young lady which is not only good-looking but she is got also a heart like gold . Look at the way she treats the servant girl they got there ! Honestly , when I was round there this morning them two girls was talking like sisters already ! " " That 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a right to treat that girl like a sister . She 's a nice little girl  --  that servant girl . " " Do n't I know it ! " Fischko protested as he poured himself out another glass of wine . " It was me that got her the job there two years ago already ; and before I would recommend to a family like B. Maslik 's a servant girl , understand me , I would make sure she comes from decent , respectable people . Also the girl is a wonderful cook , Mr. Kapfer , simple , plain , everyday dish like gefuellte Hechte , Mr. Kapfer ; she makes it like it would be roast goose already  --  so fine she cooks it . She learned it from her mother , Mr. Kapfer , also a wonderful cook . Why , would you believe it , Mr. Kapfer , that girl 's own mother and me comes pretty near being engaged to be married oncet ? " " You do n't say ! " Kapfer commented . " That was from some years ago in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess I ought to be lucky I did n't do so , on account she marries a feller by the name Silbermacher , olav hasholem , which he is got the misfortune to get killed in Kishinef . Poor Mrs. Silbermacher , she did n't live long , and the daughter , Yetta , comes to America an orphan five years ago . Ever since then the girl looks out for herself ; and so sure as you are sitting there she 's got in savings bank already pretty near eight hundred dollars . " " Is that so ? " Kapfer interrupted . " Yes , sir , " Fischko replied ; " and when she is got a thousand , understand me , I would find for her a nice young man , Mr. Kapfer , which he is got anyhow twenty-five machines a contracting shop , y'understand , and she will get married und fertig . With such good friends which I got it like Polatkin &amp; Scheikowitz , I could throw a little business their way , and the first thing you know she is settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached out his hand toward the bottle ; but Kapfer anticipated the move and emptied the remainder of the wine into his own glass . " Before I order another bottle , Fischko , " he said , " I would like to talk a little business with you . " " Never mind another bottle , " Fischko said . " I thought we was through with our business for the evening . " " With our business , yes , " Kapfer announced ; " but this story which you are telling me about Miss Silbermacher interests me , Fischko , and I know a young feller which he is got more as twenty-five machines a contracting shop ; in fact , Fischko , he is a salesman which he makes anyhow his fifty to seventy-five dollars a week , and he wants to get married bad . " " He could n't want to get married so bad as all that , " Fischko commented , " because there 's lots of girls which would be only too glad to marry a such a young feller  --  girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Fischko , " Kapfer agreed ; " but this young feller ai n't the kind that marries for money . What he wants is a nice girl which she is good-looking like this here Miss Silbermacher and is a good housekeeper , understand me ; and from what I 've seen of Miss Silbermacher she would be just the person . " " What 's his name ? " Fischko asked . " His name , " said Kapfer , " is Ury Shemansky , a close friend from mine ; and I got a date with him at twelve o'clock on the corner drug store at One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street that I should tell him how I came out this evening . " He seized his hat from an adjoining hook . " So , if you 'd wait here a few minutes , " he said , " I would go and fetch him right round here . Shall I order another bottle before I go ? " Fischko shook his head . " I got enough , " he said ; " and do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Kapfer nodded , and five minutes later he entered the all-night drug store in question and approached a young man who was seated at the soda fountain . In front of him stood a large glass of " Phospho-Nervino , " warranted to be " A Speedy and Reliable Remedy for Nervous Headache , Sleeplessness , Mental Fatigue and Depression following Over-Brainwork " ; and as he was about to raise the glass to his lips Kapfer slapped him on the shoulder . " Cheer up , Elkan , " he exclaimed . " Her name is Yetta Silbermacher and she 's got in savings bank eight hundred dollars . " " What d'ye mean she 's got money in savings bank ? " Elkan protested wearily , for the sleepless , brain-fatigued and depressed young man was none other than Elkan Lubliner . " Did you seen her ? " " I did , " Kapfer replied ; " and Miss Maslik 's a fine , lovely girl . The old man ai n't so bad either . He treated me elegant and Fischko thinks I made quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you about Miss Maslik at all , " Elkan said . " I mean Miss Silbermacher "  --  he hesitated and blushed  --  " Yetta , " he continued , and buried his confusion in the foaming glass of " Phospho-Nervino . " " That 's just what I want to talk to you about , " Kapfer went on . " Did I understand you are telling Polatkin that you never seen Fischko the Shadchen and he never seen you neither ? " " That 's right , " Elkan replied . " Then come right down with me to the Harlem Winter Garden , " Kapfer said . " I want you to meet him . He ai n't a bad sort , even if he would be a Shadchen . " " But what should I want to meet him for ? " Elkan cried . " Because , " Kapfer explained , " I am going to marry this here Miss Maslik , Elkan ; and I 'm going to improve my store property , so that my trade will be worth to Polatkin &amp; Scheikowitz anyhow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What 's that got to do with it ? " Elkan asked . " It 's got this much to do with it , " Kapfer continued : " To-morrow afternoon two o'clock I would have Polatkin and Scheikowitz at my room in the Prince Clarence . You also would be there  --  and d'ye know who else would be there ? " Elkan shook his head . " Miss Yetta Silbermacher , " Kapfer went on ; " because I am going to get Fischko to bring her down there to meet an eligible party by the name Ury Shemansky . " " What ? " Elkan exclaimed . " Ssh-sh ! " Kapfer cried reassuringly . " I am going to introduce you to Fischko right away as Ury Shemansky , provided he ai n't so shikker when I get back that he would n't recognize you at all . " Elkan nodded and paid for his restorative , and on their way down to the Harlem Winter Garden they perfected the details of the appointment for the following afternoon . " The reason why I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " is because , in the first place , it looks pretty schlecht that a feller should meet a girl only once and , without the help of a Shadchen , gets right away engaged to her ; and so , with Fischko the Shadchen there , it looks better for you both . Furthermore , in the second place , a girl which is doing housework , Elkan , must got to have an excuse , understand me ; otherwise she could n't get away from her work at all . " " But , " Elkan said , " how do you expect that Yetta would go with a Shadchen to see this here Ury Shemansky when she is already engaged to me ? " " Schafskopf ! " Kapfer exclaimed . " Telephone her the first thing to-morrow morning that you are this here Ury Shemansky and she would come quick enough ! " " That part 's all right , " Elkan agreed ; " but I do n't see yet how you are going to get Polatkin and Scheikowitz there . " Kapfer nodded his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most important part of his plan , he felt extremely doubtful . " Leave that to me , " he said sagely , and the next moment they entered the Harlem Winter Garden to find Charles Fischko gazing sadly at a solution of bicarbonate of soda and ammonia , a tumblerful of which stood in front of him on the table . " Mr. Fischko , " Kapfer said , " this is my friend Ury Shemansky , the gentleman I was speaking to you about . " " No relation to Shemansky who used to was in the customer pedler business on Ridge Street ? " Fischko asked . " Not as I 've heard , " Elkan said . " Because there 's a feller , understand me , which he went to work and married a poor girl ; and ever since he 's got nothing but Mazel . The week afterward he found in the street a diamond ring worth two hundred dollars , and the next month a greenhorn comes over with ten thousand rubles and wants to go as partners together with him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnership and starts in the remnant business with five thousand dollars net capital . He ai n't been established two weeks , understand me , when a liquor saloon next door burns out and he gets a thousand dollars smoke damage ; and one thing follows another , y'understand , till to-day he 's worth easy his fifty thousand dollars . That 's what it is to marry a poor girl , Mr. Shemansky . " He took a pull at the tumbler of bicarbonate and made an involuntary grimace . " Furthermore , I am knowing this here Miss Silbermacher ever since she is born , pretty nearly ! " Fischko cried . " You did ! " Elkan exclaimed . " Well , why did n't you tell me that , Kapfer ? " " I could n't think of everything , " Kapfer protested . " Go ahead , " Elkan said , turning to Fischko ; " let me know all about her  --  everything ! I think I got a right to know  --  ai n't it ? " " Sure you have , " Fischko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he began a laudatory biography of Yetta Silbermacher , while Elkan settled himself to listen . With parted lips and eyes shining his appreciation , he heard a narrative that justified beyond peradventure his choice of a wife , and when Fischko concluded he smote the table with his fist . " By jiminy ! " he cried . " A feller should ought to be proud of a wife like that ! " " Sure he should , " Kapfer said ; " and her and Fischko would be down at my room at the Prince Clarence to-morrow at two . " He beckoned to the waiter . " So let 's pay up and go home , " he concluded ; " and by to-morrow night Fischko would got two matches to his credit . " " K'mo she-neemar , " Fischko said as he rose a trifle laboriously to his feet , " it is commanded to promote marriages , visit the sick and bury the dead . " " And , " Kapfer added , " you 'll notice that promoting marriages comes ahead of the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived at his place of business the following morning he looked round him anxiously for his partner , who had departed somewhat early the previous day with the avowed intention of seeing just how sick Elkan was . As a matter of fact , Scheikowitz had discovered Elkan lying on the sofa at his boarding place , vainly attempting to secure his first few minutes ' sleep in over thirty-six hours ; and he had gone home truly shocked at Elkan 's pallid and careworn appearance , though Elkan had promised to keep the appointment with Fischko . Polatkin felt convinced , however , that his partner must have discovered the pretence of Elkan 's indisposition , and his manner was a trifle artificial when he inquired after the absentee . " How was he feeling , Philip ? " he asked . " Pretty bad , I guess , " Scheikowitz replied , whereat a blank expression came over Polatkin 's face . " The boy works too hard , I guess . He ai n't slept a wink for two days . " " Why , he seemed all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yesterday ? " Scheikowitz exclaimed . " I mean the day before yesterday , " Polatkin added hastily as the elevator door opened and a short , stout person alighted . He wore a wrinkled frock coat and a white tie which perched coquettishly under his left ear ; and as he approached the office he seemed to be labouring under a great deal of excitement . " Oo-ee ! " he wailed as he caught sight of Polatkin , and without further salutation he sank into the nearest chair . There he bowed his head in his hands and rocked to and fro disconsolately . " Who 's this crazy feller ? " Scheikowitz demanded of his partner . Polatkin shrugged . " He 's a button salesman by the name Rashkind , " Polatkin said . " Leave me deal with him . " He walked over to the swaying Shadchen and shook him violently by the shoulder . " Rashkind , " he said , " stop that nonsense and tell me what 's the matter . " Rashkind ceased his moanings and looked up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " She 's engaged ! " Polatkin repeated . " And you call yourself a Shadchen ! " he said bitterly . " A Shadchen ! " Scheikowitz cried . " Why , I thought you said he was a button salesman . " " Did I ? " Polatkin retorted . " Well , maybe he is , Scheikowitz ; but he ai n't no Shadchen . Actually the feller goes to work and takes Elkan up to see the girl , and they put him off by saying the girl was sick ; and now he comes down here and tells me the girl is engaged . " " Well , " Scheikowitz remarked , " you could n't get no sympathy from me , Polatkin . A feller which acts underhand the way you done , trying to make up a Shidduch for Elkan behind my back yet  --  you got what you deserved . " " What d'ye mean I got what I deserved ? " Polatkin said indignantly . " Do you think it would be such a bad thing for us  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up a match between Elkan and B. Maslik 's a daughter ? " " B. Maslik 's a daughter ! " Scheikowitz cried . " Do you mean that this here feller was trying to make up a match between Elkan and Miss Birdie Maslik ? " " That 's just what I said , " Polatkin announced . " Then I can explain the whole thing , " Scheikowitz rejoined triumphantly . " Miss Maslik had a date to meet Elkan last night yet with a Shadchen by the name Charles Fischko , and that 's why B. Maslik told this here button salesman that his daughter was engaged . " Rashkind again raised his head and regarded Scheikowitz with a malevolent grin . " Schmooes ! " he jeered . " Miss Maslik is engaged and the Shadchen was Charles Fischko , but the Chosan ai n't Elkan Lubliner by a damsight . " It was now Polatkin 's turn to gloat , and he shook his head slowly up and down . " So , Scheikowitz , " he said , " you are trying to fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a word about it , and you get the whole thing so mixed up that it is a case of trying to sit between two chairs ! You come down mit a big bump and I ai n't got no sympathy for you neither . " " What was the feller 's name ? " Scheikowitz demanded hoarsely of Rashkind , who was straightening out his tie and smoothing his rumpled hair . " It 's a funny quincidence , " Rashkind replied ; " but you remember , Mr. Polatkin , I was talking to you the other day about Julius Flixman ? " " Yes , " Polatkin said , and his heart began to thump in anticipation of the answer . " Well , Julius Flixman , as I told you , sold out his store to a feller by the name Max Kapfer , " Rashkind said and paused again . " Nu ! " Scheikowitz roared . " What of it ? " " Well , this here Max Kapfer is engaged to be married to Miss Birdie Maslik , " Rashkind concluded ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already proceeded more than halfway to the telephone . " And that 's what your Shadchen done for you , Mr. Scheikowitz ! " Rashkind said as he put on his hat . He walked to the elevator and rang the bell . " Yes , Mr. Scheikowitz , " Rashkind added , " as a Shadchen , maybe I am a button salesman ; but I 'd a whole lot sooner be a button salesman as a thief and do n't you forget it ! " After the elevator had borne Rashkind away Scheikowitz went back to the office in time to hear Marcus engaged in a noisy altercation with the telephone operator of the Prince Clarence Hotel . " What d'ye mean he ai n't there ? " he bellowed . " With you it 's always the same  --  I could never get nobody at your hotel . " He hung up the receiver with force almost sufficient to wreck the instrument . " That 'll do , Polatkin ! " Scheikowitz said . " We already got half our furniture smashed . " " Did I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the chair demolished by Scheikowitz on the previous day . " You was the cause of it , " Scheikowitz retorted ; " and , anyhow , who are you ringing up at the Prince Clarence ? " " I 'm ringing up that feller Kapfer , " Polatkin replied . " I want to tell that sucker what I think of him . " Then it was that Kapfer 's theory as to the effect of his engagement on his relations with Polatkin &amp; Scheikowitz became justified in fact . " You would n't do nothing of the kind , " Scheikowitz declared . " It ai n't bad enough that Elkan loses this here Shidduch , but you are trying to Jonah a good account also ! Why , that feller Kapfer 's business after he marries Miss Maslik would be easy worth to us three thousand dollars a year . " " I do n't care what his business is worth , " Polatkin shouted . " I would say what I please to that highwayman ! " " What do you want to do ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your face ? " Polatkin made no reply and he was about to go into the showroom when the telephone bell rang . " Leave me answer it , " Scheikowitz said ; and a moment later he picked up the desk telephone and placed the receiver to his ear . " Hello ! " he said . " Yes , this is Polatkin &amp; Scheikowitz . This is Mr. Scheikowitz talking . " Suddenly the instrument dropped with a clatter to the floor ; and while Scheikowitz was stooping to pick it up Polatkin rushed into the office . " Scheikowitz ! " he cried . " What are you trying to do  --  break up our whole office yet ? Ai n't it enough you are putting all our chairs on the bum already ? " Scheikowitz contented himself by glaring viciously at his partner and again placed the receiver to his ear . " Hello , Mr. Kapfer , " he said . " Yes , I heard it this morning already . Them things travels fast , Mr. Kapfer . No , I do n't blame you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dirty deal  --  that 's all . " Here there was a long pause , while Polatkin stood in the middle of the office floor like a bird-dog pointing at a covey of partridges . " But why could n't you come down here , Mr. Kapfer ? " Scheikowitz asked . Again there was a long pause , at the end of which Scheikowitz said : " Wait a minute  --  I 'll ask my partner . " " Listen here , Polatkin , " he said , placing his hand over the transmitter . " Kapfer says he wants to give us from two thousand five hundred dollars an order , and he wants you and me to go up to the Prince Clarence at two o'clock to see him . He wants us both there because he wants to arrange terms of credit . " " I would see him hung first ! " Polatkin roared , and Scheikowitz took his hand from the transmitter . " All right , Mr. Kapfer , " he answered in dulcet tones ; " me and Polatkin will both be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with exaggerated care . " And you would just bet your life that we will be there ! " he said . " And that 's all there is to it ! " * * * * * At half-past one that afternoon , while Max Kapfer was enjoying a good cigar in the lobby of the Prince Clarence , he received an unexpected visitor in the person of Julius Flixman . " Why , how do you do , Mr. Flixman ? " he cried , dragging forth a chair . Flixman extended a thin , bony hand in greeting and sat down wearily . " I do n't do so good , Kapfer , " he said . " I guess New York do n't agree with me . " He distorted his face in what he intended to be an amiable smile . " But I guess it agrees with you all right , " he continued . " I suppose I must got to congradulate you on account you are going to be engaged to Miss Birdie Maslik . " " Why , who told you about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning a real-estater by the name Rashkind , which he is acquainted with the Maslik family , " Flixman replied , " and he says it happened yesterday . Also they told me up at the hotel you was calling there this morning to see me . " " That 's right , " Kapfer said ; " and you was out . " " I was down to see a feller on Center Street , " Flixman went on , " and so I thought , so long as you wanted to fix up about the note , I might just as well come down here . " " I 'm much obliged to you , " Kapfer interrupted . " Not at all , " Flixman continued . " When a feller wants to pay you money and comes to see you once to do it and you ai n't in , understand me , then it 's up to you to go to him ; so here I am . " " But the fact is , " Kapfer said , " I did n't want to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you about not paying it . " " About not paying it ? " Flixman cried . " Sure ! " Kapfer replied . " I wanted to see if you would n't give me a year 's extension for that last thousand on account I am going to get married ; and with what Miss Maslik would bring me , y'understand , and your thousand dollars which I got here , I would just have enough to fix up my second floor and build a twenty-five-foot extension on the rear . You see , I figure it this way . " He searched his pocket for a piece of paper and produced a fountain pen . " I figure that the fixtures cost me twenty-two hundred , " he began , " and  --   --  " At this juncture Flixman flipped his fingers derisively . " Pipe dreams you got it ! " he said . " That store as it stands was good enough for me , and it should ought to be good enough for you . Furthermore , Kapfer , if you want to invest Maslik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but me , I could always put a thousand dollars into a bond , Kapfer . So , if it 's all the same to you , I 'll take your check and call it square . " Kapfer shrugged resignedly . " I had an idee you would , " he said , " so I got it ready for you ; because , Mr. Flixman , you must excuse me when I tell you that you got the reputation of being a good collector . " " Am I ? " Flixman snapped out . " Well , maybe I am , Kapfer , but I could give my money up , too , once in a while ; and , believe me or not , Kapfer , this afternoon yet I am going to sign a will which I am leaving all my money to a Talmud Torah School . " " You do n't say so ? " Kapfer said as he drew out his checkbook . " That 's what I am telling you , " Flixman continued , " because there 's a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control over ' em at all ; and if they would go to a Talmud Torah School , understand me , not only they learn ' em there a little Loschen Hakodesch , y'understand , but they would also pretty near club the life out of ' em . " " I 'll write out a receipt on some of the hotel paper here , " Kapfer said as he signed and blotted the check . " Write out two of ' em , so I would have a copy of what I am giving you , " Flixman rejoined . " It 's always just so good to be businesslike . That 's what I told that lawyer to-day . He wants me I should remember a couple of orphan asylums he 's interested in , and I told him that if all them suckers would train up their children they would learn a business and not holler round the streets and make life miserable for people , they would n't got to be orphans at all . Half the orphans is that way on account they worried their parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to orphan asylums they get treated kind yet . And people is foolish enough to pay a lawyer fifty dollars if he should draw up a will to leave the orphan asylum their good hard-earned money . " He snorted indignantly as he examined Kapfer 's receipt and compared it with the original . " Well , " he concluded as he appended his signature to the receipt , " I got him down to twenty-five dollars and I 'll have that will business settled up this afternoon yet . " He placed the check and the receipt in his wallet and shook hands with Kapfer . " Good-bye , " he said . " And one thing let me warn you against : A Chosan should always get his money in cash oder certified check before he goes under the Chuppah at all ; otherwise , after you are married and your father-in-law is a crook , understand me , you could kiss yourself good-bye with your wife 's dowry  --  and do n't you forget it ! " Max walked with him down the lobby ; and they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silbermacher arrived . " Hello , Fischko ! " Max cried , as Flixman tottered out into the street ; but Fischko made no reply . Instead he suddenly let go Miss Silbermacher 's arm and dashed hurriedly to the sidewalk . Max led Miss Silbermacher to a chair and engaged her immediately in conversation . She was naturally a little embarrassed by her unusual surroundings , though she was becomingly  --  not to say fashionably  --  attired in garments of her own making ; and she gazed timidly about her for her absent lover . " Elkan ai n't here yet , " Max explained , " on account you are a little ahead of time . " Miss Silbermacher 's brown eyes sparkled merrily . " I ai n't the only one , " she said as she jumped to her feet ; for , though the hands of the clock on the desk pointed to ten minutes to two , Elkan Lubliner approached from the direction of the cafe . He caught sight of them while he was still some distance away , and two overturned chairs marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he held out his hand in greeting ; but the two little dimples that accompanied Yetta 's smile overpowered his sense of propriety , and he embraced her affectionately . " Where 's Fischko ? " he asked . Both Kapfer and Miss Silbermacher looked toward the street entrance . " He was here a minute ago , " Kapfer said . " Did you tell him that I was n't Ury Shemansky at all ? " Elkan inquired . " Sure I did , " Miss Silbermacher replied , " and he goes on something terrible , on account he says Mr. Kapfer told him last night you was already engaged ; so I told him I know you was engaged because I am the party you are engaged to . " She squeezed Elkan 's hand . " And he says then , " she continued , " that if that 's the case what do we want him down here for ? So I told him we are going to meet Mr. Polatkin and Mr. Scheikowitz , and  --   --  " " And they 'll be right here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go upstairs to my room and I 'll find Fischko and bring him up also . " He conducted them to the elevator , and even as the door closed behind them Fischko came running up the hall . " Kapfer , " he said , " who was that feller which he was just here talking to you ? " " What d'ye want to know for ? " Kapfer asked . " Never mind what I want to know for ! " Fischko retorted . " Who is he ? " " Well , if you must got to know , " Kapfer said , " he 's a feller by the name Julius Flixman . " " What ? " Fischko shouted . " Fischko , " Kapfer protested , " you ai n't in no Canal Street coffee house here . This is a first-class hotel . " Fischko nodded distractedly . " Sure , I know , " he said . " Is there a place we could sit down here ? I want to ask you something a few questions . " Kapfer led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a table near the door . " Go ahead , Fischko , " he said . " Polatkin and Scheikowitz will be here any minute . " " Well , " Fischko began falteringly , " if this here feller is Julius Flixman , which he is coming from Bessarabia schon thirty years ago already , I do n't want to do nothing in a hurry , Mr. Kapfer , on account I want to investigate first how things stand . " " What d'ye mean ? " Kapfer demanded . " Why , I mean this , " Fischko cried : " If this here Flixman is well fixed , Kapfer , I want to know it , on account Miss Yetta Silbermacher is from Flixman 's sister a daughter , understand me ! " Kapfer lit a cigar deliberately before replying . He was thinking hard . " Do you mean to tell me , " he said at last , " that this here Miss Silbermacher is Julius Flixman 's a niece ? " " That 's what I said , " Fischko replied . " He comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day to this I never heard a word about him  --  Miss Silbermacher neither . " " Ai n't the rest of his family heard from him ? " Kapfer asked guardedly . " There ai n't no rest of his family , " Fischko said . " Mrs. Silbermacher was his only sister , and she 's dead over ten years since . " Kapfer nodded and drew reflectively on his cigar . " Well , Fischko , " he said finally , " I would n't let Flixman worry me none . He 's practically a Schnorrer ; he was in here just now on account he hears I am going to marry a rich girl and touches me for some money on the head of it . I guess you noticed that he looks pretty shabby  --  ai n't it ? " " And sick too , " Fischko added , just as a bellboy came into the cafe . " Mr. Copper ! " he bawled , and Max jumped to his feet . " Right here , " he said , and the bellboy handed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in a minute , " he continued ; " and you stay here till I come back , Fischko . I wo n't be long . " He followed the bellboy to the desk , where stood Polatkin and Scheikowitz . " Good afternoon , gentlemen , " he said . " Well , Mr. Kapfer , " Scheikowitz replied , " I guess I got to congradulate you . " " Sure ! " Kapfer murmured perfunctorily . " Let 's go into the Moorish Room . " " What 's the matter with the cafe ? " Polatkin asked ; but Scheikowitz settled the matter by leading the way to the Moorish Room , where they all sat down at a secluded table . " The first thing I want to tell you , gentlemen , " Kapfer said , " is that I know you feel that I turned a dirty trick on you about Elkan . " Scheikowitz shrugged expressively . " The way we feel about it , Mr. Kapfer , " he commented , " is that bygones must got to be bygones  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But , " Kapfer said , " I do n't want the bygones to be all on my side ; so I got a proposition to make you . How would it be if I could fix up a good Shidduch for Elkan myself ? " " What for a Shidduch ? " Polatkin asked . " The girl is an orphan , " Kapfer replied , " aber she 's got one uncle , a bachelor , which ai n't got no relation in the world but her , and he 's worth anyhow seventy-five thousand dollars . " " How do you know he 's worth that much ? " Polatkin demanded . " Because I got some pretty close business dealings with him , " Kapfer replied ; " and not only do I know he 's worth that much , but I guess you do too , Mr. Polatkin , on account his name is Julius Flixman . " " Julius Flixman ? " Scheikowitz cried . " Why , Julius Flixman ai n't got a relation in the world  --  he told me so himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kapfer asked . " A couple of days ago , " Scheikowitz replied . " Then that accounts for it , " Kapfer said . " A couple of days ago nobody knows he had a niece  --  not even Flixman himself did n't ; but to-day yet he would know it and he would tell you so himself . " " But  --   --  " Scheikowitz began , when once again a page entered the room , bawling a phonetic imitation of Kapfer 's name . " Wanted at the ' phone , " he called as he caught sight of Kapfer . " Excuse me , " Kapfer said . " I 'll be right back . " He walked hurriedly out of the room , and Polatkin turned with a shrug to his partner . " Well , Scheikowitz , " he began , " what did I told you ? We are up here on a fool 's errand  --  ai n't it ? " Scheikowitz made no reply . " I 'll tell you , Polatkin , " he said at length , " Flixman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Bessarabia , and he ai n't heard from her in thirty years ; and  --   --  " At this juncture Kapfer rushed into the room . " Scheikowitz , " he gasped , " I just now got a telephone message from a lawyer on Center Street , by the name Goldenfein , I should come right down there . Flixman is taken sick suddenly and they find in his pocket my check and a duplicate receipt which he gives me , written on the hotel paper . Do me the favour and come with me . " Fifteen minutes later they stepped out of a taxicab in front of an old-fashioned office building in Center Street and elbowed their way through a crowd of over a hundred people toward the narrow doorway . " Where do yous think you 're going ? " asked a policeman whose broad shoulders completely blocked the little entrance . " We was telephoned for , on account a friend of ours by the name Flixman is taken sick here , " Kapfer explained . " Go ahead , " the policeman said more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Is he dead ? " Scheikowitz cried , and the policeman nodded solemnly as he stood to one side . * * * * * More than two hours elapsed before Kapfer , Polatkin , and Scheikowitz returned to the Prince Clarence . With them was Kent J. Goldenfein . " Mr. Kapfer , " the clerk said , " there 's a man been waiting for you in the cafe for over two hours . " " I 'll bring him right in , " Kapfer said , and two minutes afterward he brought the gesticulating Fischko out of the cafe . " Do you think I am a dawg ? " Fischko cried . " I 've been here two hours ! " " Well , come into the Moorish Room a minute , " Kapfer pleaded , " and I 'll fix everything up with you afterward . " He led the protesting Shadchen through the lobby , and when they entered the Moorish Room an impressive scene awaited them . On a divan , beneath some elaborate plush draperies , sat Kent J. Goldenfein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while spread on the table in front of them were the drafts of Flixman 's will and the engrossed , unsigned copy , together with such other formidable-looking documents as Goldenfein happened to find in his pockets . He rose majestically as Fischko entered and turned on him a beetling frown . " Is this the fellow ? " he demanded sepulchrally , and Kapfer nodded . " Mr. Fischko , " Goldenfein went on , " I am an officer of the Supreme Court and I have been retained to investigate the affairs of Mr. Julius Flixman . " " Say , lookyhere , Kapfer , " Fischko cried . " What is all this ? " Kapfer drew forward a chair . " Sit down , Fischko , " he said , " and answer the questions that he is asking you . " " But  --   --  " Fischko began . " Come , come , Mr. Fischko , " Goldenfein boomed , " you are wasting our time here . Raise your right hand ! " Fischko glanced despairingly at Kapfer and then obeyed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , besides being an attorney-at-law was also a notary public , " that the affidavit you will hereafter sign will be the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth , so help you God ? " " But  --   --  " Fischko began again . " Do you ? " Goldenfein roared , and Fischko nodded . Forthwith Goldenfein plied him with such ingeniously fashioned questions concerning the Flixman family that the answers presented a complete history of all its branches . Furthermore , the affidavit which Goldenfein immediately drew up lacked only such confirmatory evidence as could easily be supplied to establish the identity of Miss Yetta Silbermacher as Julius Flixman 's only heir-at-law ; and , after Fischko had meekly signed the jurat , Goldenfein rose ponderously to his feet . " I congratulate you , Mr. Polatkin , " he said . " I think there is no doubt that your nephew 's fiancee will inherit Flixman 's estate , thanks to my professional integrity . " " What d'ye mean your professional integrity ? " Kapfer asked . " Why , if I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and insisted on the twenty-five we had agreed upon , " Goldenfein explained , " he would never have suffered the heart attack which prevented his signing the will before he died . " " Died ! " Fischko exclaimed . " Is Julius Flixman dead ? " " Koosh , Fischko ! " Polatkin commanded . " You would think you was one of the family the way you are acting . Come down to our store to-morrow and we would arrange things with you . " He turned to Kapfer . " Let 's go upstairs and see Elkan  --  and Yetta , " he said . Immediately they trooped to the elevator and ascended to the seventh floor . " All of you wait here in the corridor , " Kapfer whispered , " and I 'll go and break it to them . " He tiptoed to his room and knocked gently at the door . " Come ! " Elkan cried , and Kapfer turned the knob . On a sofa near the window sat Elkan , with his arm surrounding his fiancee 's waist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max ! " he cried . " What 's kept you ? We must have been waiting here at least a quarter of an hour ! " CHAPTER FOUR HIGHGRADE LINES " Sure , I know , Mr. Scheikowitz , " cried Elkan Lubliner , junior partner of Polatkin , Scheikowitz &amp; Company , as he sat in the firm 's office late one February afternoon ; " but if you want to sell a highgrade concern like Joseph Kammerman you must got to got a highgrade line of goods . " " Ai n't I am telling you that all the time ? " Scheikowitz replied . " Aber we sell here a popular-price line , Elkan . So what is the use talking we ai n't ekvipt for a highgrade line . " " What d'ye mean we ai n't equipped , Mr. Scheikowitz ? " Elkan protested . " We got here machines and we got here fixtures , and all we need it now is a highgrade designer and a couple really good cutters like that new feller which is working for us . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polatkin interrupted ; " but it ai n't the ekvipment which it is so important . The reputation which we got for selling a popular-price line we could n't get rid of so easy , understand me , and that Betzimmer buyer of Kammerman 's would n't got no confidence in us at all . The way he figures it we could just so much turn out a highgrade line of goods here as you could expect a feller which is acting in a moving pictures to all of a sudden sing like Charuso . " " Besides , " Scheikowitz added , " highgrade designers and really good cutters means more capital , Elkan . " " The capital you should n't worry about at all , " Elkan retorted . " Next week my Yetta gets falling due a second mortgage from old man Flixman for five thousand dollars , and  --   --  " Polatkin made a flapping gesture with his right hand . " Keep your money , Elkan , " he said . " You could got lots of better ways to invest it for Yetta as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But it do n't do no harm I should drop in and see them people . Ai n't it ? " " Sure not , " Scheikowitz continued as he swung round in his revolving chair and seized a pile of cutting clips . " They got an elegant store there on Fifth Avenue which it is a pleasure to go into even ; and the worst that happens you , Elkan , is you are out a good cigar for that Mr. Dalzell up there . " Elkan nodded gloomily , and as he left the office Polatkin 's face relaxed in an indulgent smile . " The boy is getting awful ambitious lately , Scheikowitz , " he said . " What d'ye mean , ambitious ? " Philip Scheikowitz cried angrily . " If you would be only twenty-three years of age , Polatkin , and married to a rich girl , understand me  --  and also partner in a good concern , which the whole thing he done it himself , Polatkin  --  you would act a whole lot more ambitious as he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should ought to give him credit for what he done . " " Who is knocking the boy ? " Polatkin demanded . " All I says is the boy is ambitious , Scheikowitz  --  which , if you do n't think it 's ambitious a feller tries to sell goods to Joseph Kammerman , Scheikowitz , what is it then ? " " There 's worser people to sell goods to as Joseph Kammerman , Polatkin , which he is a millionaire concern , understand me , " Scheikowitz declared ; " and you could take it from me , Polatkin , even if you would accuse him he is ambitious oder not , that boy always got idees to do big things  --  and he works hard till he lands ' em . So if you want to call that ambitious , Polatkin , go ahead and do so . When a loafer knocks it 's a boost every time . " With this ultimatum Scheikowitz followed his junior partner to the rear of the loft , where Elkan regarded with a critical eye the labors of his cutting-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " what 's biting you now ? " Elkan winked significantly  --  and a moment later he tapped an assistant cutter on the shoulder . " Max , " he said , " do you got maybe a grudge against that piece of goods , the way you are slamming it round ? " The assistant cutter smiled in an embarrassed fashion . " The fact is , " he said apologetically , " I was n't thinking about them goods at all . When you are laying out goods for cutting , Mr. Lubliner , you do n't got to think much  --  especially pastel shades . " " Pastel shades ? " Elkan repeated . " That 's what I said , " the cutter replied . " Mit colors like reds and greens , which they are hitting you right in the face , so to speak , you could n't get your mind off of ' em at all ; but pastel shades , that 's something else again . They quiet you like smoking a cigarette . " Elkan turned to his partner with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the cutter went on , " I am laying out a piece of old gold crepe mit a silver-thread border , and I assure you , Mr. Lubliner , it has an effect on me like some one would give me a glass of schnapps already . " " Stiegen , Max , " said Elkan , moving away , " you got too much to say for yourself . " Max nodded resignedly and continued the spreading of the goods on the cutting table , while Elkan and Scheikowitz walked out of the room . " That 's the new feller I was telling you about , " Elkan said . " Meshugganeh Max Merech they call him . " " Meshugga he may be , " Scheikowitz replied , " but just the same he 's got a couple of good idees also , Elkan . Only this morning he makes Redman the designer pretty near crazy when he says that the blue soutache on that new style 2060 kills the blue in the yoke , y'understand ; and he was right too , Elkan . Polatkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrugged again as he put on his hat and coat preparatory to going home . " A lot our class of trade worries about such things ! " he exclaimed . " So far as they are concerned the soutache could be crimson and the yoke green , and if the price was right they 'd buy it anyhow . " " Do n't you fool yourself , Elkan , " Scheikowitz said while Elkan rang for the elevator . " The price is never right if the workmanship ai n't good . " * * * * * That Elkan Lubliner 's progress in business had not kept pace with his social achievements was a source of much disappointment to both Mrs. Lubliner and himself ; for though the firm of Polatkin , Scheikowitz &amp; Company was still rated seventy-five thousand dollars to one hundred thousand dollars  --  credit good  --  Elkan and Mrs. Lubliner moved in the social orbit of no less a personage than of Max Koblin , the Raincoat King , whose credit soared triumphantly among the A 's and B 's of old-established commission houses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that evening which caused Elkan to leave his place of business at half-past five ; and when Mrs. Lubliner and he sallied forth from the gilt and porphyry hallway of their apartment dwelling they were fittingly arrayed to meet Max 's guests , none of whom catered to the popular-price trade of Polatkin , Scheikowitz &amp; Company . " Why did n't you told him we are getting next week paid off for five thousand dollars a second mortgage ? " Yetta said , continuing a conversation begun at dinner that evening . " I did told him , " Elkan insisted ; " but what is the use talking to a couple of old-timers like them ? " Yetta sniffed contemptuously with the impatience of youth at the foibles of senility , as exemplified by the doddering Philip Scheikowitz , aged forty-five , and the valetudinarian Marcus Polatkin , whose hair , albeit unfrosted , had been blighted and in part swept away by the vicissitudes of forty-two winters . " You ca n't learn an old dawg young tricks , " Elkan declared , " and we might just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we would never compete with such highgrade concerns like B. Gans oder Schwefel &amp; Zucker . " They walked over two blocks in silence and then Elkan broke out anew . " I tell you , " he said , " I am sick and tired of it . B. Gans talks all the time about selling this big Macher and that big Macher , and him and Mr. Schwefel gets telling about what a millionaire like Kammerman says to him the other day , or what he says to Mandelberger , of Chicago , y'understand  --  and I could n't say nothing ! If I would commence to tell ' em what I says to such customers of ours like One-Eye Feigenbaum oder H. Margonin , of Bridgetown , understand me , they would laugh me in my face yet . " Yetta pressed his arm consolingly as they ascended the stoop of Max Koblin 's house on Mount Morris Park West , and two minutes later they entered the front parlour of that luxurious residence . " And do you know what he says to me ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He says to me , ' Benson , ' he says , ' I 've been putting on musical shows now for fifteen years , and an idee like that comes from a genius already . There 's a fortune in it ! ' " At this juncture Mrs. Koblin noted the arrival of the last of her guests . " Why , hello , Yetta ! " she cried , rising to her feet . " Ai n't you fashionable getting here so late ? " She kissed Yetta and held out a hand to Elkan as she spoke . " Ai n't you ashamed of yourself , Elkan , keeping Yetta 's dinner waiting because you claim you 're so busy downtown ? " she went on . " I guess you know everybody here except Mr. Benson . " She nodded toward the promulgator of Heaven-born ideas , who bowed solemnly . " Pleased to meet you , Mister  --   --  " " Lubliner , " Elkan said . " Mister Lubliner , " Benson repeated , passing his begemmed fingers through a shock of black , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , " he continued , addressing the company , " to-morrow I 'm getting a scenario along them lines I just indicated to you from one of the highest-grade fellers that 's writing . " Here ensued a pause , during which B. Gans searched his mind for an anecdote concerning some retailer of sufficiently good financial standing , while Joseph Schwefel , of Schwefel &amp; Zucker , cleared his throat preparatory to launching a verbatim report of a conversation between himself and a buyer for one of the most exclusive costume houses on Fifth Avenue ; but even as Schwefel rounded his lips to enunciate an introductory " Er , " Benson obtained a fresh start . " Now you remember ' The Diners Out , ' Ryan &amp; Bernbaum 's production last season ? " he said , addressing Elkan . " In that show they had an idee like this : Eight ponies is let down from the flies  --  see ?  --  and George DeFrees makes his entrance in a practical airyoplane  --  I think it was George DeFrees was working for Ryan &amp; Bernbaum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At this point he screwed up his face and leaning his elbow on the arm of his chair he placed four fingers on his forehead in the attitude known theatrically as Business of Deep Consideration . " No , " he said at last  --  " it was George DeFrees . George jumps out of the airyoplane and says : ' They followed me to earth , I see . ' " Benson raised his eyebrows at the assembled guests . " Angels ! " he announced . " Get the idee ? ' They followed me to earth , I see . ' Cue . And then he sings the song hit of the show : ' Come Take a Ride in My Airyoplane . ' " B. Gans shuffled his feet uneasily and Joseph Schwefel pulled down his waistcoat . As manufacturers of highgrade garments they had accompanied more than one customer to the entertainment described by Benson ; but to Elkan the term " ponies " admitted of only one meaning , and this conversational arabesque of flies , little horses , aeroplanes and George DeFrees made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said before B. Gans could head him off , " just that there entrance boomed the show . Ryan &amp; Bernbaum up to date clears a hundred and twenty thousand dollars over and above all expenses . " " Better as the garment business ! " Max Koblin commented  --  and B. Gans nodded and yawned . " Ai n't we going to have no pinocle ? " he asked . Max rose and threw open the sliding doors leading to the dining room , where cards and chips were in readiness . " Will you join us , Mr. Benson ? " he asked . " That 'll make five with Mr. Lubliner , " Benson replied ; " so supposing you , Gans and Schwefel go ahead , and Mr. Lubliner and me will join you later . Otherwise you would got to deal two of us out  --  which it makes a pretty slow game that way . " " Just as you like , " Max said ; and after Mrs. Koblin and Yetta had retired abovestairs to view the most recent accession to Mrs. Koblin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collar and adjusted his black stock necktie . Then he lit a fresh cigar and prepared to lay bare to Elkan the arcana of the theatrical business . " Yes , Mr. Lubliner , " he said , " the show business is a business like any other business . It ai n't like you got an idee it is  --  opening wine for a bunch of chickens , understand me , and running round the streets till all hours of the morning . " " I never got no such idee , " Elkan protested . " You ai n't , Mr. Lubliner , " Benson continued , " because it 's very evidence to me that you do n't know nothing about it ; but there 's a whole lot of people got that idee anyhow , y'understand ; and what I am always trying to tell everybody is that the show business is like the garment business oder the drygoods business  --  a business for a business man , not a loafer ! " Elkan made an inarticulate noise which Benson took to be an expression of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a whole lot to do with it , " he went on  --  " art and idees ; and when you take a feller like Ryan , which he could write a show , write the music , put it on and play the leading part all by himself , y'understand , and a feller like Bernbaum , which used to was Miller , Bernbaum &amp; Company in the pants business  --  you got there an ideel combination ! " Elkan nodded and looked helplessly round him at the Circassian walnut , of which half a forestful had gone to make up the furnishings of Koblin 's front parlor . " But , " Benson said emphatically , " you take me , for instance  --  and what was I ? " He told off his former occupations with the index finger of his right hand on each digit of his left . " First I was a salesman ; second I was for myself in the infants ' wear business ; third I was noch einmal a salesman . Then I become an actor , because everybody knows my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maslowsky . ' For four years I played all the first-class vaudeville circuits here and on the other side in England . But though I made good money , Mr. Lubliner , the real big money is in the producing end . " " Huh-huh ! " Elkan ejaculated . " So that 's the way it is with me , Mr. Lubliner , " Benson continued . " I am just like Ryan &amp; Bernbaum , only instead of two partners there is only just one ; which I got the art , the idees and the business ability all in myself ! " " That must make it very handy for you , " Elkan commented . " Handy ai n't no name for it , " Benson replied . " It 's something you do n't see nowheres else in the show business ; but I 'll tell you the truth , Mr. Lubliner  --  the work is too much for me ! " " Why do n't you get a partner ? " Elkan asked . Benson made a circular gesture with his right hand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Lubliner , " he said , " but why should I divide my profits ? Am I right or wrong ? " " Well , that depends how you are looking at it , " Elkan said . " I am looking at it from the view of a business man , Mr. Lubliner , " Benson rejoined . " Here I got a proposition which I am going to put on  --  a show of idees  --  a big production , understand me ; which if Ryan &amp; Bernbaum makes from their ' Diners Out ' a hundred thousand dollars , verstehst du , I could easily make a hundred and fifty thousand ! And yet , Mr. Lubliner , all I invest is five thousand dollars and five thousand more which I am making a loan at a bank . " " Which bank ? " Elkan asked  --  so quickly that Benson almost jumped in his seat . " I  --  I did n't decide which bank yet , " he replied . " You see , Mr. Lubliner , I got accounts in three banks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they begged me I should go in the Minuit National Bank . All right . I went in the Minuit National Bank . H'afterward Sam Feder comes to me and says : ' Benson , ' he says , ' you are an old friend from mine , ' he says . ' Why do you bother yourself you should go into this bank and that bank ? ' he says . ' Why do n't you come to my bank ? ' he says , ' and I would give you all the money you want . ' So you see , Mr. Lubliner , it is immaterial to me which bank I get my money from . " Again he passed his jewelled fingers through his hair . " No , Mr. Lubliner , " he announced after a pause , " my own brother even I would n't give a look-in . " Elkan made no reply . As a result of Benson 's gesture he was busy estimating the value of eight and a quarter carats at eighty-seven dollars and fifty cents a carat . " Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could really call enormous ! If you got the time I would like to show you a few figures . " " I got all evening , " Elkan answered , whereat Benson pulled from his waistcoat pocket a fountain pen ornamented with gold filigree . " First , " he said , " is the costumes . " And therewith he plunged into a maze of calculation that lasted for nearly an hour . Moreover , at the end of that period he entered into a new series of figures , tending to show that by the investment of an additional five thousand dollars the profits could be increased seventy-five per cent . " But I 'm satisfied to invest my ten thousand , " he said , " because five thousand is my own and the other five thousand I could get easy from the Kosciuscko Bank , whereas the additional five thousand I must try to interest somebody he should invest it with me . And so far as that goes I would n't bother myself at all . " " You 're dead right , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benson grew crimson with chagrin . " Sure I 'm dead right , " he said ; " and if you and Mrs. Lubliner would come down to my office in the Siddons Theatre Building to-morrow night , eight o'clock , I would send one of my associates round with you and he will get you tickets for the ' Diners Out , ' understand me ; and then you would see for yourself what a big house they got there . Even on Monday night they turn ' em away ! " " I 'm much obliged to you , " Elkan replied . " I 'm sure Mrs. Lubliner and me would enjoy it very much . " " I 'm sorry for you if you would n't , " Benson retorted ; " and that there ' Diners Out ' ai n't a marker to the show I 'm putting on , Mr. Lubliner  --  which you can see for yourself , a business proposition , which pans out pretty near two hundred thousand dollars on a fifteen-thousand-dollar investment , is got to be right up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you said ten thousand dollars was the investment , " Elkan remarked . " I did , " Benson replied with some heat ; " but if some one comes along and wants to invest the additional five thousand dollars I would n't turn him down , Mr. Lubliner . " He rose to his feet to join the pinocle players in the dining room . " So I hope you enjoy the show to-morrow night , " he added as he strolled away . * * * * * From six to eight every evening Max Merech underwent a gradual transformation , for six o'clock was the closing hour at Polatkin , Scheikowitz &amp; Company 's establishment , while eight marked the advent of the Sarasate Trio at the Cafe Roman , on Delancey Street . Thus , at six , Max Merech was an assistant cutter ; and , indeed , until after he ate his supper he still bore the outward appearance of an assistant cutter , though inwardly he felt a premonitory glow . After half-past seven , however , he buttoned on a low , turned-down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he assumed his real character  --  that of a dilettante . At the Cafe Roman each evening he specialized on music ; but with the spirit of the true dilettante he neglected no one of the rest of the arts , and was ever to be found at the table next to the piano , a warm advocate of the latest movement in painting and literature , as well as an appreciative listener to the ultramodern music discoursed by the Sarasate Trio . " If that ai n't a winner I ai n't no judge ! " he said to Boris Volkovisk , the pianist , on the evening of the conversation with Elkan set forth above . He referred to a violin sonata of Boris ' own composition which the latter and Jacob Rekower , the violinist , had just concluded . Boris smiled and wiped away the perspiration from his bulging forehead , for the third movement of the sonata , marked in the score Allegro con fuoco , had taxed even the technic of its composer . " A winner of what ? " Boris asked  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publish it nobody buys it . " Max nodded his head slowly in sympathetic acquiescence . " But anyhow you ai n't so bad off like some composers , " he said . " You 've anyhow got a good musician to play your stuff for you . " He smiled at Jacob Rekower , who plunged his hands into his trousers pockets and shrugged deprecatingly . " Sure , I know , " Rekower said ; " and if we play too much good stuff Marculescu raises the devil with us we should play more popular music . " He spat out the words " popular music " with an emphasis that made a Tarrok player at the next table jump in his seat . " Nu , " said the latter as the deal passed , " what is the matter with popular music ? If it would n't be for writing popular music , understand me , many a decent , respectable composer would got to starve ! " He turned his chair round and abandoned the card game the better to air his views on popular music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know a young feller by the name Milton Jassy which last year he makes two thousand dollars already from syncopating Had gadyo and calling it the " Wildcat Rag , " and this year he is writing the music for a new show and I bet yer the least he makes out of it is five thousand dollars . " " Yow ! Five thousand dollars ! " Merech exclaimed . " Such people you hear about , but you oser see ' em . " " Do n't you ? " said the Tarrok player , drawing a cardcase from his breast pocket . " Well , you see one now . " He laid face upward on the table a card which read : **46;7195;TOOLONG " THE SONGS YOU ALL SING " MILTON JASSY SIDDONS THEATRE BUILDING ROOM 1400 " STUFF WITH A PUNCH " LAZY DAISY EDDIE WILDCAT RAG ALL ABOARD FOR SLEEPYTOWN **46;7243;TOOLONG For a brief interval Volkovisk , Rekower , and Merech regarded Jassy 's card in silence . " Well , " Merech said at last , " what of it ? " Jassy shrugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " only your friend there is knocking popular music ; and though I admit that I did n't got to go to the Wiener conservatory so as I could write popular music exactly , y'understand , still I could write sonatas and trios and quartets and even concerti and symphonies till I am black in the face already and I could n't pay my laundry bill even . " For answer Volkovisk turned to the piano and seized from the pile of music a blue-covered volume . It was the violin sonata of Richard Strauss , and handing the violin part to Rekower he seated himself on the stool . Then with a premonitory nod to Rekower he struck the opening chords , and for more than ten minutes Jassy and Merech sat motionless until the first movement was finished . " When Strauss wrote that he could over pay his laundry bill either , " Volkovisk said , rising from the stool . He sat down wearily at the table and lit a cigarette . " So you see , " he began , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cried an angry voice at his elbow . " If you want to practise , practise at home . I pay you here to play for my customers , not for yourselves , Volkovisk ; and once and for all I am telling you you should cut out this nonsense and spiel a little music once in a while . " It was the proprietor , Marculescu , who spoke , and Volkovisk immediately seated himself at the piano . This time he took from the pile of music three small sheets , one of which he placed on the reading desk and the other on Rekower 's violin stand . After handing the other sheet to the ' cellist he plunged into a furious rendition of " Wildcat Rag . " In the front part of the cafe a group of men and women , whose clothes and manners proclaimed them to be slummers from the upper West Side , broke into noisy applause as the vulgar composition came to an end , and in the midst of their shouting and stamping Jassy rose trembling from his seat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began a repetition of the number , and it was not until he had turned the corner of the street and the melody had ceased to sound in his ears that he slackened his pace . When he did so , however , a friendly hand fell on his shoulder and he turned to find Max Merech close behind him . " Nu , Mr. Jassy , " Max said , " you should n't be so broke up because you could n't write so good as Richard Strauss . " Jassy stood still and looked Max squarely in the eye . " That 's just the point , " he said in hollow tones . " Might I could if I tried ; but I am such an Epikouros that I do n't want to try . I would sooner make money out of rubbish than be an artist like Volkovisk . " Max shrugged and elevated his eyebrows . " A man must got to live , " he said as he seized Jassy 's arm and began gently to propel him back to the Cafe Roman . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but living ai n't all having good clothes to wear and good food to eat . Living for an artist like Volkovisk is composing music worthy of an artist . Aber what do I do , Mister  --   --  " " Merech , " Max said . " What do I do , Mr. Merech ? " Jassy continued . " I am all the time throwing away my art in the streets with this rotten stuff I am composing . " * * * * * " Well , I tell you , " Max said after they had reentered the cafe and had seated themselves at a table remote from the piano , " composing music is like manufacturing garments , Mr. Jassy . Some one must got to cater to the popular-price trade and only a few manufacturers gets to the point where they make up a highgrade line for the exclusive retailers . Ai n't it ? " Jassy nodded as the waiter brought the cups of coffee . " Now you take me , for instance , " Max continued . " Once I worked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was a pleasure to handle the goods in that place . What an elegant line of silks and embroidery they got it there ! Believe me , Mr. Jassy , every day I went to work there like I would be going to a wedding already , such a beautiful goods they made it ! Aber now I am working by a popular-price concern , Mr. Jassy , which , you could take it from me , the colors them people puts together in one garment gives me the indigestion already ! " Again Jassy nodded sympathetically . " And why did I make a change ? " Max went on . " Because them people pays me seven dollars a week more as B. Gans , Mr. Jassy ; and though art is art , understand me , seven dollars a week ai n't to be coughed at neither . " For a few minutes Jassy sipped his coffee in silence . " That 's all right , too , " he said ; " but with garments you could make just so much money manufacturing a highgrade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . " Max nodded sapiently . " I give you right there , " he agreed , " and that 's because the manufacturer of the highgrade line does business in the same way as the popular-price concern . Aber you take the composer of highgrade music and all he does is compose . He 's too proud to poosh it , Mr. Jassy ; whereas the feller what composes popular music he 's just the same like the feller what manufacturers a popular-price line of garments  --  he not only manufacturers his line but he pooshes it till he gets a market for it . " " There ai n't no market for a highclass line of music , " Jassy said hopelessly . " Why ai n't there ? " Max demanded . " Did you ever try to market a symphony ? Did Volkovisk ever try to get anybody with money interested in his stuff ? No , sirree , sir ! All that feller does is to play it to a lot of Schnorrers like me , which no matter how much we like his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own case , for instance . You told us a few minutes ago you are writing some music for a new show . Now , if you would n't mind my asking , who is putting in the capital for that show ? " " Well , " Jassy replied , " a feller called Benson is putting it in and part of the capital is from his own money and the rest he borrows . " " Just like a new beginner would do in the garment business , " Max commented . " Aber who does he borrow it from ? A bank maybe  --  what ? " " Some he gets from a bank , " Jassy replied , " and the rest is he trying to raise elsewheres . To-night he tells me he is getting an introduction to a business man which he hopes to lend from him five oder ten thousand dollars . " " Five oder ten thousand dollars ! " Max cried . " Shema beni . For five thousand dollars Volkovisk could publish all the music he ever wrote and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand dollars would be enough even . " " That I would n't deny at all , " Jassy rejoined . " Aber who would you find stands willing he should invest in Volkovisk 's music a thousand dollars ? Would he ever get back his thousand dollars even , let alone any profits ? " " It 's a speculation , I admit , " Max commented ; " but you take Richard Strauss , for instance , and if some feller would staked Strauss to a thousand dollars capital when he needed it , understand me , not alone he would got his money back but if we would say , for example , the thousand dollars represents a ten-per-cent interest in Strauss ' business , to-day yet the feller would be worth his fifty thousand dollars , because everybody knows what a big success Strauss made . Actually the feller must got orders at least six months ahead . Why for one song alone they pay him a couple thousand dollars ! " " Well , " Jassy asked , " if you feel there 's such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars and finance Volkovisk ? " Max laughed aloud . " Me  --  I could n't raise nothing , " he said ; " aber you  --  you are feeling sore at yourself because you are writing popular stuff . Here 's a chance for you to square yourself with your art . Why do n't you help Volkovisk out ? All you got to do is to find out who is loaning this here Benson the ten thousand dollars and get him to stake Volkovisk to a thousand . " Jassy tapped the table with his fingers . " For that matter I could say the same thing to you , " he declared . " You consider Volkovisk 's talent so high as a business proposition , Merech , why do n't you get some business man interested  --  one of your bosses , for instance ? " He rose from his chair as he spoke and placed ten cents on the table as his share of the evening 's expenses . " Think it over , " he said ; and long after he had closed the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trousers pocket and pondered the suggestion . " After all , " he mused as Marculescu began to turn out the lights one by one , " why should n't I  --  the very first thing in the morning ? " It was not , however , until Polatkin and Scheikowitz had gone out to lunch the following day , leaving Elkan alone in the office , that Max could bring his courage to the sticking point ; and so fearful was he that he might regret his boldness before it was too late , he fairly ran from the cutting room to the office and delivered his preparatory remarks in the outdoor tones of a political spellbinder . " Mr. Lubliner , " he cried , " could I speak to you a few words something ? " Elkan rose and slammed the door . " Say , lookyhere , Merech , " he said , " if you want a raise do n't let the whole factory know about it , otherwise we would be pestered to death here . Remember , also , " he continued as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us a few weeks  --  and do n't go so quick as all that . " " What d'ye mean , a raise ? " Max asked . " I ai n't said nothing at all about a raise . I am coming to see you about something entirely different already . " Elkan looked ostentatiously at his watch . " I ai n't got too much time , Merech , " he said . " Nobody 's got too much time when it comes to fellers asking for raises , Mr. Lubliner , " Max retorted ; " aber this here is something else again , as I told you . " " Well , do n't beat no bushes round , Merech ! " Elkan cried impatiently . " What is it you want from me ? " " I want from you this , " Max began huskily : " Might you know Tschaikovsky maybe oder Rimsky-Korsakoff . " " Tschaikovsky I never heard of , " Elkan replied , " nor the other concern neither . Must be new beginners in the garment business  --  ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , so far as I know , " Max continued ; " aber they made big successes even if they was n't , because all the money ai n't in the garment business , Mr. Lubliner , and Tschaikovsky and Rimsky-Korsakoff , even in the old country , made so much money they lived in palaces yet . Once when I was a boy already , Tschaikovsky comes to Minsk and they got up a parade for him  --  such a big Macher he was ! " " I do n't doubt your word for a minute , Merech ; aber what is all this got to do mit me ? " " It ai n't got nothing to do with you , Mr. Lubliner , " Max declared  --  " only I got a friend by the name Boris Volkovisk , and believe me or not , Mr. Lubliner , in some respects Tschaikovsky and Rimsky-Korsakoff could learn from that feller , because , you could take it from me , Mr. Lubliner , there 's some passages in the Fifth Symphony , understand me , which I hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stirred uneasily in his chair . " I do n't know what you are talking about at all , " he said . " I am talking about this , " Max replied ; and therewith he began to explain to Elkan the aspirations and talent of Boris Volkovisk and his  --  Max '  --  scheme for their successful development . For more than half an hour he unfolded a plan by which one thousand dollars might be judiciously expended so as to secure the maximum benefit to Volkovisk 's career  --  a plan that during the preceding two years Volkovisk and he had thoroughly discussed over many a cup of coffee in Marculescu 's cafe . " And so you see , Mr. Lubliner , " he concluded , " it 's a plain business proposition ; and if you was to take for your thousand dollars , say , for example , a one-tenth interest in the business Volkovisk expects to do , understand me , you would get a big return for your investment . " Elkan lit a cigar and puffed away reflectively before speaking . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is what you wanted to talk to me about ? " Max nodded . " Well , then , all I could say is , " Elkan went on , " you are coming to the wrong shop . A business proposition like that is for a banker , which he is got so much money he do n't know what to do with it , Merech . " Max ' face fell and he turned disconsolately away . " At the same time , Max , " Elkan added , " I ai n't feeling sore that you come to me with the proposition , understand me . The trouble ai n't with you that you got such an idee , Max ; the trouble is with me that I could n't see it . It 's like a feller by the name Dalzell , a buyer for Kammerman 's store , says to me this morning . ' Lubliner , ' he says , ' I could n't afford to take no chances buying highgrade garments from a feller that is used to making a popular-price line , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipped your factory would be the trouble is a popular-price manufacturer could n't think big enough to turn out expensive garments . To such a manufacturer goods at two dollars a yard is the limit , and goods at ten dollars a yard he could n't imagine at all . And even if he could induce himself to use stuff at ten dollars a yard , y'understand , it goes against him to be liberal with such high-priced goods , so he skimps the garment . ' " He blew a great cloud of smoke as a substitute for a sigh . " And Dalzell was right , Max , " he concluded . " You could n't expect that a garment manufacturer like me is going to got such big idees as investing a thousand dollars in a highgrade scheme like yours . With me a thousand dollars means so many yards piece goods , so many sewing machines or a week 's payroll ; aber it do n't mean giving a musician a show he should compose highgrade music . I ai n't educated up to it , Max @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money somewheres else . " * * * * * When M. Sidney Benson entered his office in the Siddons Theatre Building late that afternoon he found Jassy seated at his desk in the mournful contemplation of some music manuscript . " Nu , Milton , " Benson cried , " you should n't look so rachmonos . I surely think I got ' em coming ! " " You think you got ' em coming ! " Jassy repeated with bitter emphasis . " You said that a dozen times already  --  and always the feller was n't so big a sucker like he looked ! " " That was because I did n't work it right , " Benson replied . " This time I am making out to do the feller a favour by letting him in on the show , and right away he becomes interested . His name is Elkan Lubliner , a manufacturer by cloaks and suits , and to-night he is coming down with his wife yet , and you are going to take ' em round to the ' Diners Out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Out ' mit ' em ? " Milton ejaculated with every inflection of horror and disgust . " Sure ! " Benson replied cheerfully . " Six dollars it 'll cost us , because Ryan pretty near laughs in my face when I asked him for three seats . But never mind , Milton , it 'll be worth the money . " " Will it ? " Jassy retorted . " Well , not for me , Mr. Benson . Why , the last time I seen that show I says I would n't sit through it again for a hundred dollars . " " A hundred dollars is a lot of money , Milton , " Benson said . " Aber I think if you work it right you will get a hundred times a hundred dollars before we are through , on account I really got this feller going . So you should listen to me and I would tell you just what you want to say to the feller between the acts . " Therewith Benson commenced to unfold a series of " talking points " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he proceeded , Jassy 's eyes wandered from the title page of the manuscript music inscribed " Opus 47  --  Trio in G moll , " and began to glow in sympathy with Benson 's well-laid plan . " There 's no use shilly-shallying , Milton , " Benson concluded . " The season is getting late , and if we 're ever going to put on that show now is the time . " Milton nodded eagerly . " Aber why do n't you take ' em to the show yourself , Mr. Benson ? " he asked hopefully . " Because , not to jolly you at all , Mr. Benson , I must got to say it you are a wonderful talker . " Benson shrugged his shoulders and smiled weakly . " I am a wonderful talker , I admit , " he agreed ; " but I got a hard face , Milton , whereas you , anyhow , look honest . So you should meet me at Hanley 's afterward , understand me , and we would try to close the deal there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trousers pocket and produced a modest roll of bills , from which he detached six dollars . " Here is the money , " he added , " and you should be here to meet them people at eight o'clock sharp . " On the stroke of eight Milton Jassy returned to Benson 's office in the Siddons Theatre Building and again seated himself at his desk in front of the pile of manuscript music . This time , however , he brushed aside the title page of his Opus 47 and spread out an evening paper to beguile the tedium of awaiting Benson 's " prospects . " Automatically he turned to the department headed Music and Musicians , and at the top of the column his eye fell on the following item : Ferencz Lanczhid , the Budapest virtuoso , will be the soloist at the concert this evening of the Philharmonic Society . He will play the Tschaikovsky Violin Concerto , Opus 35 , and the remainder of the program will consist of Dvorak 's Symphony , Aus der Neuen Welt , and the ever-popular Meistersinger Overture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leaned back in his chair , while in his ears sounded the adagio passage that introduces the first movement of the " New World Symphony . " Simultaneously the occupant of the next office slammed down his rolltop desk and began to whistle a lively popular melody . It was " Wildcat Rag , " and Milton struck the outspread newspaper with his clenched fist . Then rising to his feet he gathered together the loose pages of his " Opus 47 " and placed them tenderly in a leather case just as the door opened and Elkan and Yetta entered . " I hope we ai n't late , " Elkan said . " Not at all , " Milton replied . " This is Mr. and Mrs. Lubliner  --  ai n't it ? " As he drew forward a chair for Yetta he saluted his visitors with a slight , graceful bow , a survival of his conservatory days . " Sit down , " he said ; " we got lots and lots of time . " " I thought the show started at a quarter-past eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does and it does n't , " Milton replied hesitatingly ; " that is to say , some shows start at a quarter-past eight and others not till half-past eight . " " But I mean this here ' Diners Out ' starts at a quarter-past eight  --  ai n't it ? " Elkan insisted . " ' The Diners Out ! ' " Milton exclaimed as though he heard the name for the first time . " Oh , sure , the ' Diners Out ' starts at a quarter-past eight , and that 's just what I wanted to talk to you about . " He turned to Yetta with an engaging smile which , with his black hair and his dark , melancholy eyes , completely won over that far from unimpressionable lady . " Now , Mrs. Lubliner , " he began , " your husband is a business man  --  ai n't it ? And if some one comes to him and says , ' Mr. Lubliner , I got here two garments for the same price  --  say , for example , two dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aber plenty of it mit cheap embroidery on it , understand me ; while the other is from finest silk a garment  --  not much of it , y'understand , but plain and beautiful . ' " " What for a garment could you got for two dollars ? " Elkan asked  --  " especially a silk garment ? " " He 's only saying for example , Elkan , " Yetta interrupted . " Garments I am only using , so to speak , " Milton explained . " What I really mean is : You got your choice to go to a popular show like the ' Diners Out ' or to a really highgrade show , Mr. Lubliner . So I leave it to you , Mr. Lubliner . Which shall it be ? " Once again he smiled at Yetta . " Why , to the highgrade show , sure , " Yetta replied , and she seized her husband by the arm . " Come along , Elkan ! " she cried ; and after Milton had secured the leather portfolio containing his " Opus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We could walk over there from here , " Milton said when they reached the sidewalk , and he led the way across town toward Carnegie Hall . " What for a show is this we are going to see ? " Elkan asked . " Also a musical show ? " Milton nodded . " The best musical show there is , " he declared . " Do you like maybe to hear good music ? " " I 'm crazy about it , " Yetta replied . " Symphonies , concerti and such things ? " Milton inquired . " Symphonies ? " Elkan repeated . " What is symphonies ? " " I could n't explain it to you , " Milton said , " because we ai n't got time ; aber you would see for yourself . Only one thing I must tell you , Mr. Lubliner  --  when the orchestra plays you should n't speak nothing  --  Mrs. Lubliner neither . " " I would n't open my mouth at all , " Elkan assured him solemnly ; and a few minutes later Milton seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall , with Elkan and Yetta  --  one each side of him . " So you ai n't never been to a symphony concert before ? " Milton began , leaning toward Elkan ; and , as the latter shook his head , a short , stout person in the adjoining seat raised his eyebrows involuntarily . " Well , you got a big pleasure in store for you , " Milton went on ; " and another thing I must got to tell you : Might you would hear some pretty jumpy music which you would want to keep time to mit your foot . Do n't you do it ! " Elkan 's neighbour concealed a smile with one hand , and then , he , too , turned to Elkan , who had received Milton 's warning with a sulky frown . " You 're friend is right , " he said . " People always have to be told that the first time they go to a symphony concert ; and the next time they go they not only see the wisdom of such advice , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does beat time with his foot . " He accompanied his remark with so gracious a smile that Elkan 's frown immediately relaxed . " A new beginner could n't get too much advice , " he said , and his neighbour leaned farther forward and addressed Milton . " You 've chosen a fine program to introduce your friend to good music with , " he said ; and therewith began a lively conversation that lasted until a round of applause signalized the appearance of the conductor . The next moment he raised his baton and the celli began to sigh the mournful phrase which ushers in the symphony . Milton leaned back luxuriously as the woodwind commenced the next phrase ; and then , while the introduction ended with a sweeping crescendo and the tempo suddenly increased , Elkan sat up and his eyes became fixed on the trombone and trumpet players . He maintained this attitude throughout the entire first movement , and it was not until the conductor 's arm fell motionless at his side that he settled back in his seat . " Well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " A-Number-One ! " Elkan answered hoarsely . " It would suit me just so well if it would last the whole evening and we would n't have no singing and dancing at all . " " What do you mean  --  no singing and dancing ! " Milton exclaimed . " Sure ! " Elkan continued . " I wish them fellers would play the whole evening . " The conductor tapped his desk with his baton . " Do n't worry , " Milton commented as he settled himself for the next movement . " You 'll get your wish all right . " Elkan looked inquiringly at his mentor , but Milton only placed his forefinger to his lips ; and thereafter , until the conclusion of the symphony , the pauses between the movements of the symphony were so brief that Elkan had no opportunity to make further inquiries . " Well , neighbour , " asked the gentleman on his right , as the musicians filed off the stage for the ten-minutes ' intermission , " what do you think of your first symphony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his throat . " The symphony is all right , " he said ; " but , with all them operators there , what is the use they are trying to save money hiring only one foreman ? " " One foreman ? " his neighbour cried . " Sure  --  the feller with the stick , " Elkan went on blandly . " Naturally he could n't keep his eye on all them people at oncet  --  ai n't it ? I am watching them fellers , which they are working them big brass machines , for the last half hour , and except for five or ten minutes they sit there doing absolutely nothing  --  just fooling away their time . " " Them fellers ai n't fooling away their time , " Milton said gravely . " They ai n't got nothing to do only at intervals . " " Then I guess they must pay ' em by piecework  --  ai n't it ? " Elkan asked . " They pay ' em so much a night , " Milton explained . " Well , in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all I could say is if I would got working in my place half a dozen fellers which I am paying by the day , understand me , and the foreman could n't keep ' em busy only half the time , verstehst du , he would quick look for another job . " Elkan 's neighbour on the right had been growing steadily more crimson , and at last he hurriedly seized his hat and passed out into the aisle . " That 's a pretty friendly feller , " Elkan said as he gazed after him . " Do you happen to know his name ? " " I ai n't never heard his name , " Milton replied ; " but he is seemingly crazy about music . I seen him here every time I come . " " Well , I do n't blame him none , " Elkan commented ; " because you take the Harlem Winter Garden , for instance , and though the music is rotten , understand me , they got the nerve to charge you yet for a lot of food which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas here they did n't even ask us we should buy so much as a glass beer . " At this juncture the short , stout person returned and proceeded to entertain Elkan and Yetta by pointing out among the audience the figures of local and international millionaires . " And all them fellers is crazy about music too ? " Elkan asked . " So crazy , " his neighbour said , " that the little man over there , with the white beard , spends almost twenty thousand a year on it ! " " And yet , " Milton said bitterly , " there 's plenty fellers in the city which year in and year out composes chamber music and symphonic music which they could n't themselves make ten dollars a week ; and , when it comes right down to it , none of them millionaires would loosen up to such new beginners for even five hundred dollars to help them get a hearing . " The short person received Milton 's outburst with a faint smile . " I 've heard that before , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting any of those great unknown composers . " " That 's because most of ' em is so bashful they ai n't got sense enough to push themselves forward , " Milton replied ; " aber if you really want to meet one I could take you to-night yet to a cafe on Delancey Street where there is playing a trio which the pianist is something you could really call a genius . " " You do n't tell me ! " Elkan 's neighbour cried . " Why , I should be delighted to go with you . " " How about it , Mr. Lubliner ? " Milton asked . " Are you and Mrs. Lubliner agreeable to go downtown after the show to the cafe on Delancey Street ? It 's a pretty poor neighbourhood already . " Yetta smiled . " Sure , I know , " she said ; " but it would n't be the first time me and Elkan was in Delancey Street . " " Then it 's agreed that we 're all going to hear the genius , " Elkan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jassy and Lubliner  --  it 's hardly fair you should n't know my name too . " He felt in his waistcoat pocket and finally handed a visiting card to Elkan , who glanced at it hurriedly and with trembling fingers passed it on to his wife , for it was inscribed in old English type as follows : **32;7291;TOOLONG =Mr . Joseph Kammerman= =Fostoria Hotel= =New York= **32;7325;TOOLONG " Once and for all , I am telling you , Volkovisk , either you would got to play music here or quit ! " Marculescu cried at eleven o'clock that evening . " The customers is all the time kicking at the stuff you give us . " " What d'ye mean , stuff ? " Max Merech protested . " That was no stuff , Mr. Marculescu . That was from Brahms a trio , and it suits me down to the ground . " " Suits you ! " Marculescu exclaimed . " Who in blazes are you ? " " I am auch a customer , Mr. Marculescu , " Max replied with dignity . " Yow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here all night on one cup coffee . A customer , sagt er ! A loafer  --  that 's what you are ! It ai n't you I am making my money from , Merech  --  it 's from them TakeefimA uptown ; and they want to hear music , not Brahms . So you hear what I am telling you , Volkovisk ! You should play something good  --  like ' Wildcat Rag ' . " Footnote A : Takeefim  --  Aristocracy . " Wait a minute , Mr. Marculescu , " Max interrupted . " Do you mean to told me them lowlife bums in front there , which makes all that Geschrei over ' Dixerlie ' and such like Narrischkeit , is Takeefim yet ? " " I do n't want to listen to you at all , Merech ! " Marculescu shouted . " I do n't care if you want to listen to me oder not , " Merech said . " I was a customer here when you got one little store mit two waiters ; and it was me and all the other fellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our few pennies , your first start . Now you are too good for us with your uptown Takeefim . Why , them same Takeefim only comes here , in the first place , because they want to see what it looks like in one of the East Side cafes , where they got such good music and such interesting characters , which sits and drinks coffee and plays chess und Tarrok . " He glared at the enraged Marculescu and waved his hands excitedly . " What you call loafers they call interesting characters , Mr. Marculescu , " he continued , " and what you call stuff they call good music  --  and that 's the way it goes , Mr. Marculescu . You are a goose which is killing its own golden eggs ! " " So ! " Marculescu roared . " I am a goose , am I ? You loafer , you ! Out of here before I kick you out ! " " You would n't kick nothing , " Max rejoined , " because I am happy to go out from here ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Wildcat Rag , ' I do n't want to stay at all . " He rose from his chair and flung ten cents on to the table . " And furthermore , " he cried by way of peroration , " people do n't got to come five miles down to Delancey Street to hear ' Wildcat Rag , ' Mr. Marculescu ; so , if you keep on playing it , Mr. Marculescu , you will quick find that it 's an elegant tune to bust up to  --  and that 's all I got to say ! " As he walked away , Marculescu made a sign to his pianist . " Go ahead , Volkovisk  --  play ' Wildcat Rag ! ' " he said . Then he followed Max to the front of the cafe ; and before they reached the front tables , at which sat the slummers from uptown , Volkovisk began to pound out the hackneyed melody . " That 's what I think of your arguments , Merech ! " Marculescu said , walking behind the cashier 's desk . Max paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he began to deliver it his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth , for at that instant the door opened and there entered a party of four , with Elkan Lubliner in the van . A moment later , however , Milton Jassy pushed his guests to one side and strode angrily toward Marculescu . " Koosh ! " he bellowed and stamped his foot on the floor , whereat the music ceased and even the uptown revellers were startled into silence . Only Marculescu remained unabashed . " Say , " he shouted as he rushed from behind his desk , " what do you think this joint is ?  --  a joint ! " " I think what I please , Marculescu , " Milton said , " and you should tell Volkovisk to play something decent . Also you should bring us two quarts from the best Tchampanyer wine  --  from French wine Tchampanyer , not Amerikanischer . " He waved his hand impatiently and three waiters  --  half of Marculescu 's entire staff  --  came on the jump ; so that , a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wraps and seated at one of the largest tables facing the piano . It was not until then that Milton descried Max Merech hovering round the door . " Merech ! " he called . " Kommen sie ' r ueber ! " Max shook his head shyly and half-opened the door , but Elkan forestalled him . He fairly bounded from the table and caught his assistant cutter by the arm just as he was disappearing on to the sidewalk . " Max , " he said , " what 's the matter with you ? Ai n't you coming in to meet my wife ? " Max shrugged in embarrassment . " You do n't want me to butt into your party , Mr. Lubliner ! " he said . " Listen , Max , " Elkan almost pleaded ; " not only do I want you to , but you would be doing me a big favour if you would come in and join us . Also , Max , I am going to introduce you as our designer . You ai n't got no objections ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he followed his employer into the cafe . " Yetta , " Elkan began , " I think you seen Mr. Merech before  --  ai n't it ? " Mrs. Lubliner smiled and extended her hand . " How do you do , Mr. Merech ? " she said ; and Max bowed awkwardly . " Mr. Kammerman , " Elkan continued , " this is our designer , Max Merech ; and I could assure you , Mr. Kammerman , a very good one too . He 's got a great eye for colour . " " And a good ear for music , " Milton added as Kammerman shook the blushing dilettante by the hand . " In fact , Mr. Kammerman , if he has got such taste in designing as he is showing in music , " Milton went on , " he must be a wonder ! Nothing suits him but the best . And now , if you will excuse me , I 'll get Volkovisk he should play you his sonata . " He left the table with his leather portfolio under his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest consultation with Volkovisk and the cellist , after which he returned smiling to his seat . " First Volkovisk plays his sonata , ' Opus 30 , ' " he explained , " and then he would do a little thing of my own . " He nodded briskly to Volkovisk , and Kammerman settled himself resignedly to a hearing of what he anticipated would be a commonplace piece of music . After the first six measures , however , he sat up straight in his chair and his face took on an expression of wonder and delight . Then , resting his elbow on the table , he nursed his cheek throughout the first movement in a posture of earnest attention . " Why , " he cried as the musician paused , " this man is a genius ! " Max Merech nodded . His face was flushed and his eyes were filled with tears . " What did I told you , Mr. Lubliner ? " he said ; and Jassy raised his hand for silence while Volkovisk began the second movement . This and the succeeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the composition ; and when at length Volkovisk rose from the piano stool and approached the table Kammerman jumped from his chair and wrung the composer 's hand . " Sit in my chair , " he insisted , and snapped his fingers at Marculescu , who fumed impotently behind the cashier 's desk . " Here , " he called ; " more wine  --  and look sharp about it ! " Marculescu obeyed sulkily and again the glasses were filled . " Gentlemen , " Kammerman said , " and Mrs. Lubliner , I ask you to drink to a great career just beginning . " " Lots of people said that before , " Max murmured after he had emptied his glass . " They said it , " Kammerman replied , " but I pledge it . You shall play no more in this place , Volkovisk  --  and here is my hand on it . " Max Merech beamed across the table at his employer . " Well , Mr. Lubliner , " he said , " you lost your chance . " Elkan shrugged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius fellers for me maybe , Max ? " he said . And therewith Kammerman slapped Milton Jassy on the back . " By Jove ! We forgot your trio , " he said . " Play it , Volkovisk , as your valedictory here . " Again Volkovisk sought the piano , and after whispered instructions to his assistants he began a rendition of Jassy 's " Opus 47 , " from the manuscript Milton had brought with him ; but , allowing for the faulty technic of the ' cellist and the uncertainty that attends the first reading from manuscript of any composition , there was little to recommend Jassy 's work . " Very creditable ! " Kammerman said at the end of the movement . " Perhaps we might hear the rest . " Max kept his eyes fixed on the table to avoid looking at Jassy , and even Volkovisk seemed embarrassed as he swung round on the piano stool . " Well ? " he said inquiringly . Jassy emitted a bitter laugh . " That 'll do , Volkovisk , " he replied hoarsely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point Max attempted to create a diversion . " Look at that lady sitting there ! " he said . " She puts on a yellow hat to an old-gold dress . She 's committing murder and she do n't know it ! " Kammerman seized on the incident as a way of escape from criticising Jassy 's trio . " That reminds me , Lubliner , " he said . " Give me your business card if you have one with you . I must tell Mr. Dalzell , my cloak buyer , to look over your line . I 'm sure , with a designer of Mr. Merech 's artistic instincts working for you , you will be making up just the highgrade line of goods we need . " * * * * * One year later , the usual crowd of first-nighters lounged in the lobby of the Siddons Theatre during the intermission between the second and third acts of M. Sidney Benson 's newest musical comedy , " Marjory from Marguery 's , " and commented with enthusiasm on the song hit of the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more gifted even whistled the melody , skipping the hard part and proceeding by impromptu and conventional modulation to the refrain , which had been expressly designed by its composer , Milton Jassy , so as to present no technical difficulties to the most modest whistler . Through this begemmed and piping throng , Kammerman and Volkovisk elbowed their way to the street for a breath of fresh air ; and as they reached the sidewalk Kammerman heaved a sigh of relief . " What a terrible melody ! " he ejaculated . " But the plot ai n't bad , " Volkovisk suggested , and Kammerman grinned involuntarily . " To be exact , the two plots are n't bad , " he said . " It 's made up of two old farces . One of them is ' Embrassons nous , Duval , ' and the other ' Un Garcon , de chez Gaillard . ' " " But the costumes are really something which you could call beautiful ! " Volkovisk declared . " Merech approved the costumes too , " Kammerman agreed with a laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said that if you endured it to the end you were to be sure to tell Jassy the colorings were splendid ! " He lit a cigarette reflectively . " That man is a regular shark for coloring ! " he said . " It seems that when I first met him that night he was only an assistant cutter ; but Elkan Lubliner made him designer very shortly afterward  --  and it has proved a fine thing for both of them . I understand we bought fifteen thousand dollars ' worth of goods from them during the past year ! " " He deserved all the good luck that came to him , " Volkovisk cried ; and Kammerman placed his hand affectionately on his protege 's shoulder . " There 's a special Providence that looks after artists , " he said as they reentered the theatre , " whether they paint , write , compose , or design garments .

Might you also know Julius Tarnowitz , of the Tarnowitz-Wixman Department Store , Rochester ? " " Bought from us a couple years a small bill , " Marcus Polatkin said . " I wish we could sell him more . " " Well , his brother , Sig Tarnowitz , lives across the street from us , " Louis cried triumphantly . " Sig 's got a fine business there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a business ? " " A furniture business , " Louis replied . " And might you would know also Joel Ribnik , which he is running the McKinnon-Weldon Drygoods Company , of Cyprus , Pennsylvania ? " " That 's the feller what you nearly sold that big bill to last month , Elkan , " Scheikowitz commented . " Well , his sister is married to a feller by the name Robitscher , of Robitscher , Smith &amp; Company , the wallpaper house and interior decorators . They got an elegant place down the street from us . " " But  --   --  " Elkan began again . " But nothing , Elkan ! " Marcus Polatkin interrupted with a ferocious wink ; for Louis Stout , as junior partner in the thriving Williamsburg store of Flugel &amp; Stout , was viewing Polatkin , Scheikowitz &amp; Company 's line preparatory to buying his spring line of dresses . " But nothing , Elkan ! Mr. Stout knows what he is talking about , Elkan ; and if I would be you , instead I would argue with him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park on Sunday and give the place a look . " " That 's the idea ! " Louis cried . " And you should come and take dinner with us first . Mrs. Stout would be delighted . " " What time do you eat dinner ? " Philip Scheikowitz asked , frowning significantly at Elkan . " Two o'clock , " Louis replied , and Polatkin and Scheikowitz nodded in unison . " He 'll be there , " Polatkin declared . " At a quarter before two , " Scheikowitz added and Elkan smiled mechanically by way of assent . " So come along , Mr. Stout , " Polatkin said , " and look at them Ethel Barrymore dresses . I think you 'll like ' em . " He led Stout from the office as he spoke while Scheikowitz remained behind with Elkan . " Honest , Elkan , " he said , " I 'm surprised to see the way you are acting with Louis Stout ! " " What do you mean , the way I 'm acting , Mr. Scheikowitz ? " Elkan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy a house in a neighbourhood which I do n't want to live in at all just to oblige a customer ? " " Schmooes , Elkan ! " Scheikowitz exclaimed . " No one asks you you should buy a house there . Be a little reasonable , Elkan . What harm would it do you , supposing you and Yetta should go out to Burgess Park next Sunday ? Because you know the way Louis Stout is , Elkan . He will look over our line for two weeks yet before he decides on his order  --  and meantime we should n't entegonize him . " " I do n't want to antagonize him , " Elkan said ; " but me and Yetta made our arrangements to go out to Johnsonhurst next Sunday . " " Go out there the Sunday after , " cried Scheikowitz . " Johnsonhurst would still be on the map , Elkan . It ai n't going to run away exactly . " Thus persuaded , Elkan and Yetta on the following Sunday elbowed their way through the crowd at the entrance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes boarded a train for Burgess Park . " Well , all I can say is , " Yetta gasped , after they had seized on the only vacant seats in the car , " if it 's this way on Sunday what would it be on weekdays ? " " There must have been a block , " Elkan said meekly . Only by the exercise of the utmost marital diplomacy had he induced his wife to make the visit to Louis Stout 's home , and one of his most telling arguments had been the advantage of the elevated railroad journey to Burgess Park over the subway ride to Johnsonhurst . " Furthermore , " Yetta insisted , referring to another of Elkan 's plausible reasons for visiting Burgess Park , " I suppose all these Italieners and Betzimmers are customers of yours which we was going to run across on our way down there . Ai n't it ? " Elkan blushed guiltily as he looked about him at the carload of holiday-makers ; but a moment later he exclaimed aloud as he recognized in a seat across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Le Printemps , Pittsburgh . " Why , how do you do , Mr. Kamin ? " he said . " Not Elkan Lubliner , from Polatkin , Scheikowitz &amp; Company ? " Mr. Kamin exclaimed . " Well , who would think to meet you here ! " He rose from his seat , whereat a bulky Italian immediately sank into it ; and as livery of seizin he appropriated the comic section of Mr. Kamin 's Sunday paper , which had fallen to the floor of the car , and spread it wide open in front of him . " Now you lost your seat , " Elkan said ; " so you should take mine . " He jumped to his feet and Kamin sat down in his place , while a Neapolitan who hung on an adjacent strap viciously scowled his disappointment . " You ai n't acquainted with Mrs. Lubliner ? " Elkan said . " Pleased to meetcher , " Kamin murmured . Yetta bowed stiffly and Elkan hastened to make conversation by way of relieving Mr. Kamin 's embarrassment . " Looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country in such crowds , " he said . " I bet yer , " Kamin rejoined emphatically . " I arrived in New York two weeks ahead of my schedule , because I simply got to do my buying now or lose a lot of early spring trade . " " Have you been in town long ? " Elkan asked . " Only this morning , " Kamin answered ; " and I am going down to eat dinner with my sister , Mrs. Ortelsburg . She lives in Burgess Park . " " Is that so ? " Elkan exclaimed . " We ourselves are going to Burgess Park  --  to visit a friend . " " A customer , " Yetta corrected . " A customer could also be a friend , " Kamin declared , " especially if he 's a good customer . " " This is a very good customer , " Elkan went on , " by the name Louis Stout . " " Louis Stout , from Flugel &amp; Stout ? " Kamin cried . " Why , him and Benno Ortelsburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll probably see you down in Burgess Park this afternoon , on account every Sunday afternoon Louis plays pinocle at my brother-in-law 's house . Why do n't he fetch you round to take a hand ? " " I should be delighted , " Elkan said ; but Yetta sniffed audibly . " I guess we would be going home right after dinner , before the crowd starts back , " she said . " Not on a fine day like this you would n't , " Kamin protested ; " because once you get out to Burgess Park you ai n't in such a hurry to come back . I wish we would got such a place near Pittsburgh , Mrs. Lubliner . I bet yer I would quick move out there . The smoke gets worser and worser in Pittsburgh ; in fact , it 's so nowadays we could n't sell a garment in pastel shades . " " Well , we got plenty blacks , navy blues , Copenhagen blues and brown in our spring line , Mr. Kamin , " Elkan said ; and therewith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company 's new stock that , by the time the train drew into Burgess Park , Kamin was making figures on the back of an envelope in an effort to convince Elkan that his prices were all wrong . " But , anyhow , " Kamin said , as they parted in front of the Ortelsburgs ' colonial residence , " I will see you in the store to-morrow morning sure . " " You 'll see me before then , because me and Yetta is coming round this afternoon sure  --  ai n't we , Yetta ? " Mrs. Lubliner nodded , for her good humour had been restored by Elkan 's splendid exhibition of salesmanship . " This afternoon is something else again , " Kamin said , " because a feller which tries to mix pinocle with business is apt to overplay his hand in both games . " * * * * * " No , Joe ; you 're wrong , " Benno Ortelsburg said to his brother-in-law , Joseph Kamin , as they sipped their after-dinner coffee in the Ortelsburg library that day . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . You say yourself he tries to sell goods to you on the car already . Why should n't we try to sell Glaubmann 's house to him while he 's down here ? And we 'll split the commission half and half . " Kamin hesitated before replying . " In business , Joe  --  it 's Esau 's fable of the lion and the mouse every time ! " Ortelsburg continued . " The mouse scratches the lion 's back and the lion scratches the mouse 's back ! Ai n't it ? " " But you know so well as I do , Benno , that Glaubmann 's house on Linden Boulevard ai n't worth no eighteen thousand dollars , " Kamin said . " Why ai n't it ? " Benno retorted . " Glaubmann 's Linden Boulevard house is precisely the same house as this , built from the same plans and everything  --  and this house costs me thirteen thousand five hundred dollars . Suburban real estate is worth just so much as you can get some sucker to pay for it , Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chips ready , because I see Glaubmann coming up the street now . " A moment later Glaubmann entered the library and greeted Kamin uproariously . " Hello , Joe ! " he cried . " How 's the drygoods business in Pittsburgh ? " " Not so good as the real-estate business in Burgess Park , Barney , " Kamin replied . " They tell me you are selling houses hand over fist . " " Yow  --  hand over fist ! " Barnett cried . " If I carry a house six months and sell it at a couple thousand dollars ' profit , what is it ? " " I got to get rid of a whole lot of garments to make a couple thousand dollars , Barney , " Kamin said ; " and , anyhow , if you sell a house for eighteen thousand dollars which it cost you thirteen-five you would be making a little more as four thousand dollars . " " Sure I would , " Glaubmann replied ; " aber the people which buys green-goods and gold bricks ai n't investing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred-dollar lots between high and low water on some of them Jersey sandbars . " " There is all kinds of come-ons , Barney , " Joe said , " and the biggest one , understand me , is the business man who is willing to be played for a sucker , so as he can hold his customers ' trade . " " You got the proper real-estate spirit , Joe , " Benno declared , as he returned with the cards and chips . " You do n't allow the ground to grow under your feet . Just at present , though , we are going to spiel a little pinocle and we would talk business afterward . " " Real estate ai n't business , " Kamin retorted . " It 's a game like pinocle ; and I got a little Jack of Diamonds and Queen of Spades coming round here in a few minutes which I would like to meld . " " Now you are talking poetry , " Barnett said . " Take it from me , Barney , " Benno Ortelsburg interrupted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact ; and if you could see your way clear to pay a thousand dollars ' commission , y'understand , me and Joe is got a customer for your Linden Boulevard house at eighteen thousand dollars . " " Jokes you are making me ! " Barnett cried . " You should n't drink so much schnapps after dinner , Benno , because I could as much get eighteen thousand for that Linden Boulevard house as I would pay you a thousand dollars commission if I got it . " " You ai n't paying me the thousand dollars , " Benno protested . " Do n't you suppose Joe 's got a look-in-here ? " " And furthermore , " Joe said , " you also got Louis Stout to consider . If you think Louis Stout is going to sit by and see a commission walk past him , Benno , you are making a big mistake . " " I 'm willing we should give Louis a hundred or so , " Benno agreed . " We got to remember Louis is a customer of his also . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , as the doorbell rang . " Stiegen ! " Benno hissed ; and a moment later he ushered Elkan and Yetta into the library , while Mr. Stout brought up the rear . Benno cleared his throat preparatory to introducing the newcomers , but Louis Stout brushed hastily past him . " Mr. Glaubmann , " Louis said , " this is my friend , Elkan Lubliner . " " And you forget Mrs. Lubliner , " cried Mrs. Ortelsburg , who had hurried downstairs at the sound of voices in the hall . " I 'm Mrs. Ortelsburg , " she continued , turning to Yetta . " Wo n't you come upstairs and take your things off ? " " Elkan , " Louis Stout continued , " you better go along with her . I want you to see what an elegant lot of clothes-closets they got upstairs . You know most houses is designed by archytecks which all they are trying to do is to save money for the builder . Aber this archyteck was an exception . The way he figures it he tries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of closet room , and  --  excuse me , ladies  --  to hell with the expenses ! I 'll go upstairs with you and show you what I mean . " Benno frowned angrily . " ' Tai n't necessary , Louis , " he said . " Mrs. Ortelsburg would show him . " He drew forward chairs ; and , after Elkan and Yetta had followed Mrs. Ortelsburg upstairs , he closed the library door . " Could n't I introduce people in my own house , Stout ? " he demanded . Louis Stout shrugged his shoulders . " If you mean as a matter of ettykit  --  yes , " he retorted ; " aber if it 's a real-estate transaction  --  no . When I bring a customer to Mr. Glaubmann for his Linden Boulevard house , Ortelsburg , I do the introducing myself , which afterward I do n't want no broker to claim he earned the commission by introducing the customer first  --  understand me ? " He seated himself and smiled calmly at Kamin , Glaubmann , and his host . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly , " he declared , " and do n't you forget it . " " Where 's your written authorization from the owner ? " Ortelsburg demanded , raising a familiar point of real-estate brokerage law ; and Stout tapped his breast pocket . " Six months ago already , " Stout replied , " Mr. Glaubmann writes me if I hear of a customer for his house he would protect me , and I got the letter here in my pocket . Ai n't that right , Mr. Glaubmann ? " Glaubmann had walked toward the window and was looking out upon the budding white poplars that spread their branches at a height of six feet above the sidewalks of Burgess Park . He nodded in confirmation of Louis ' statement ; and as he did so a short , stout person , who was proceeding hurriedly down the street in the direction of the station , paused in front of the Ortelsburg residence . A moment later he rang the bell and Ortelsburg himself opened the door . " Nu , Mr. Kovner ! " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Glaubmann just nods to me out of your window , " Max Kovner replied , " and I thought he wants to speak to me . " Benno returned to the library with Max at his heels . " Do you want to speak to Mr. Kovner , Glaubmann ? " he asked , and Glaubmann started perceptibly . During the months of Max Kovner 's tenancy Glaubmann had not only refrained from visiting his Linden Boulevard house , but he had also performed feats of disappearance resembling Indian warfare in his efforts to avoid Max Kovner on the streets of Burgess Park . All this was the result of Max Kovner 's taking possession of the Linden Boulevard house upon Glaubmann 's agreement to make necessary plumbing repairs and to paint and repaper the living rooms ; and Glaubmann 's complete breach of this agreement was reflected in the truculency of Max Kovner 's manner as he entered the Ortelsburg library . " Maybe Glaubmann do n't want to speak to me , " he cried , " but I want to speak to him , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ortelsburg 's library table with his clenched fist . " Once and for all , Mr. Glaubmann , " he said , " either you would fix that plumbing and do that painting , understand me , or I would move out of your Linden Boulevard house the first of next month sure ! " Glaubmann received this ultimatum with a defiant grin . " Schmooes , Kovner , " he said , " you would n't do nothing of the kind ! You got mit me a verbal lease for one year in the presence of my wife , your wife and a couple of other people which the names I forget . " " And how about the repairs ? " Kovner demanded . " If you seen the house needs repairs and you go into possession anyhow , " Glaubmann retorted , " you waive the repairs , because the agreement to repair merges in the lease . That 's what Kent J. Goldstein , my lawyer , says , Kovner ; and ask any other lawyer , Kovner , and he could tell you the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am stuck with that rotten house for a year ! Is that the idee ? " Glaubmann nodded . " All right , Mr. Glaubmann , " Kovner concluded . " You are here in a strange house to me and I could n't do nothing ; but I am coming over to your office to-morrow , and if I got to sit there all day , understand me , we would settle this thing up . " " That 's all right , " Ortelsburg interrupted . " When you got real-estate business with Glaubmann , Mr. Kovner , his office is the right place to see him . Aber here is a private house and Sunday , Mr. Kovner , and we ai n't doing no real-estate business here . So , if you got a pressing engagement somewheres else , Mr. Kovner , do n't let me hurry you . " He opened the library door , and with a final glare at his landlord Max passed slowly out . " That 's a dangerous feller , " Glaubmann said as his tenant banged the street door behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a written lease containing a covenant for repairs by the landlord , y'understand , and now he wants to blame me for it ! Honestly , the way some people acts so unreasonable , Kamin , it 's enough to sicken me with the real-estate business ! " Kamin nodded sympathetically , but Louis Stout made an impatient gesture by way of bringing the conversation back to its original theme . " That ai n't here or there , " he declared . " The point is I am fetching you a customer for your Linden Boulevard house , Glaubmann , and I want this here matter of the commission settled right away . " Ortelsburg rose to his feet as a shuffling on the stairs announced the descent of his guests . " Commissions we would talk about afterward , " he said . " First let us sell the house . " * * * * * In Benno Ortelsburg 's ripe experience there were as many methods of selling suburban residences as there were residences for sale ; and , like the born salesman he was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be overcome by no hard-and-fast rules of salesmanship . Thus he quickly divined that whoever sought to sell Elkan a residence in Burgess Park must first convince Yetta , and he proceeded immediately to apportion the chips for a five-handed game of auction pinocle , leaving Yetta to be entertained by his wife . Mrs. Ortelsburg 's powers of persuasion in the matter of suburban property were second only to her husband 's , and the game had not proceeded very far when Benno looked into the adjoining room and observed with satisfaction that Yetta was listening open-mouthed to Mrs. Ortelsburg 's fascinating narrative of life in Burgess Park . " Forty hens we got it , " she declared ; " and this month alone they are laying on us every day a dozen eggs  --  some days ten , or nine at the least . Then , of course , if we want a little fricassee once in a while we could do that also . " " How do you do when you are getting all of a sudden company ? " Yetta asked . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You did n't ? " Mrs. Ortelsburg exclaimed . " Why , right behind the depot is Mrs. J. Kaplan 's a delicatessen store , which I am only saying to her yesterday , ' Mrs. Kaplan , ' I says , ' how do you got all the time such fresh , nice smoke-tongue here ? ' And she says , ' It 's the country air , ' she says , ' which any one could see ; not alone smoke-tongue keeps fresh , aber my daughter also , when she comes down here , ' she says , ' she is pale like anything  --  and look at her now ! ' And it 's a fact , Mrs. Lubliner , the daughter did look sick , and to-day yet she 's got a complexion fresh like a tomato already . That 's what Burgess Park done for her ! " " But do n't you got difficulty keeping a girl , Mrs. Ortelsburg ? " Yetta inquired . " Difficulty ? " Mrs. Ortelsburg cried . " Why , just let me show you my kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , we are only twenty minutes from Coney Island ; and , in the second place , with all the eggs which we got it , they could always entertain their fellers here in such a fine , big kitchen , which I am telling my girl , Lena : ' So long as you give ' em omelets or fried eggs mit fat , Lena , I do n't care how many eggs you use  --  aber butter is butter in Burgess Park oder Harlem . ' " In this vein Mrs. Ortelsburg continued for more than an hour , while she conducted Yetta to the kitchen and cellar and back again to the bedrooms above stairs , until she decided that sufficient interest had been aroused to justify the more robust method of her husband . She therefore returned to the library , and therewith began for Benno Ortelsburg the real business of the afternoon . " Well , boys , " he said , " I guess we would quit pinocle for a while and join the ladies . " He chose for this announcement a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and as , in his capacity of banker , he adjusted the losses of the other players , he kept up a merry conversation directed at Mrs. Lubliner . " Here in Burgess Park , " he said , " we play pinocle and we leave it alone ; while in the city when a couple business men play pinocle they spend a day at it  --  and why ? Because they only get a chance to play pinocle once in a while occasionally . Every night they are going to theatre oder a lodge affair , understand me ; whereas here , the train service at night not being so extra elegant , y'understand , we got good houses and we stay in ' em ; which in Burgess Park after half-past seven in the evening any one could find a dozen pinocle games to play in  --  and all of ' em breaks up by half-past ten already . " With this tribute to the transit facilities and domesticity of Burgess Park , he concluded stacking up the chips and turned to Mrs. Lubliner . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " if you would n't persuade your husband to move out to Burgess Park , understand me , I shall consider it you do n't like our house here at all . " " But I do like your house ! " Yetta protested . " I should hope so , " Benno continued , " on account it would be a poor compliment to a lot of people which could easy be good customers of your husband . For instance , this house was decorated by Robitscher , Smith &amp; Company , which Robitscher lives across the street already ; and his wife is Joel Ribnik 's  --  the McKinnon-Weldon Drygoods Company 's  --  a sister already . " " You do n't tell me ? " Yetta murmured . " And Joel is staying with ' em right now , " Benno went on . " Furthermore , we got our furniture and carpets by Sig Tarnowitz , which he lives a couple of doors down from here  --  also got relatives in the retail drygoods business by the name Tarnowitz-Wixman Drygoods Company . The brother , Julius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's a regular buyers ' colony here , so to speak , " Louis Stout said , and Joseph Kamin nodded . " Tell you what you do , Benno , " Joseph suggested . " Get Tarnowitz and Ribnik to come over here . I think Elkan would like to meet them . " Benno slapped his thigh with a resounding blow . " That 's a great idee ! " he cried ; and half an hour later the Ortelsburg library was thronged with visitors , for not only Joel Ribnik and Julius Tarnowitz had joined Benno 's party , but seated in easy chairs were Robitscher , the decorator , and Tarnowitz , the furniture dealer . " Yes , siree , sir ! " Robitscher cried . " Given the same decorative treatment to that Linden Boulevard house , Mr. Lubliner , and it would got Ortelsburg 's house here skinned to pieces , on account over there it is more open and catches the sun afternoon and morning both . " During this pronouncement Elkan 's face wore a ghastly smile and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a touring car which is beginning to skid toward a telegraph pole . " In that case I should recommend you do n't buy a Kermanshah rug for the front room , " Sigmund Tarnowitz interrupted . " I got in my place right now an antique Beloochistan , which I would let go at only four hundred dollars . " " Aber four hundred dollars is an awful lot of money to pay for a rug , " Elkan protested . He had avoided looking at Yetta for the past half-hour ; but now he glanced fearfully at her , and in doing so received a distinct shock , for Yetta sat with shining eyes and flushed cheeks , inoculated beyond remedy with the virus of the artistic-home fever . " Four hundred ai n't so much for a rug , " she declared . " Not for an antique Beloochistan , " Sig Tarnowitz said , " because every year it would increase in value on you . " " Just the same like that Linden Boulevard house , " Ortelsburg added , " which you could take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get right away an offer of five hundred dollars advance on your purchase price I would eat the house , plumbing and all . " At the word " plumbing " Glaubmann started visibly . " The plumbing would be fixed so good as new , " he said ; " and I tell you what I would do also , Mr. Lubliner  --  I would pay fifty per cent . of the decorations if Mr. Ortelsburg would make me an allowance of a hundred dollars on the commission ! " " Could anything be fairer than this ? " Ortelsburg exclaimed ; and he grinned maliciously as Louis Stout succumbed to a fit of coughing . " But we ai n't even seen the house ! " Elkan cried . " Never mind we ai n't seen it , " Yetta said ; " if the house is the same like this that 's all I care about . " " Sure , I know , " Elkan replied ; " but I want to see the house first before I would even commence to think of buying it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ai n't got no objection to show you the house from the outside ; aber there is at present people living in the house , understand me , which for the present we could n't go inside . " " Mr. Lubliner do n't want to see the inside , Glaubmann ! " Ortelsburg cried , in tones implying that he deprecated Glaubmann 's suggestion as impugning Elkan 's good faith in the matter . " The inside would be repaired and decorated to suit , Mr. Glaubmann , but the outside he 's got a right to see ; so we would all go round there and give a look . " Ten minutes afterward a procession of nine persons passed through the streets of Burgess Park and lingered on the sidewalk opposite Glaubmann 's house . There Ortelsburg descanted on the comparatively high elevation of Linden Boulevard and Mrs. Ortelsburg pointed out the chicken-raising possibilities of the back lot ; and , after gazing at the shrubbery and incipient shade trees that were planted in the front yard , the line of march was resumed in the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made at Mrs. J. Kaplin 's delicatessen store ; and , laden with packages of smoked tongue , Swiss cheese and dill pickles , the procession returned to the Ortelsburg residence marshalled by Benno Ortelsburg , who wielded as a baton a ten-cent loaf of rye bread . Thus the remainder of the evening was spent in feasting and more pinocle until nearly midnight , when Elkan and Yetta returned to town on the last train . Hence , with his late homecoming and the Ortelsburgs ' delicatessen supper , Elkan slept ill that night , so that it was past nine o'clock before he arrived at his office the following morning . Instead of the satirical greeting which he anticipated from his senior partner , however , he was received with unusual cordiality by Polatkin , whose face was spread in a grin . " Well , Elkan , " he said , " you done a good job when you decided to buy that house . " " When I decided to buy the house ? Who says I decided to buy the house ? " Elkan cried . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was here by a quarter to eight already ; and not alone J. Kamin was here , but Joel Ribnik and Julius Tarnowitz comes in also . Scheikowitz and me has been on the jump , I bet yer ; in fact , Scheikowitz is in there now with J. Kamin and Tarnowitz . Between ' em , those fellers has picked out four thousand dollars ' goods . " Elkan looked at his partner in unfeigned astonishment . " So soon ? " he said . " Ribnik too , " Polatkin continued . " He makes a selection of nine hundred dollars ' goods  --  among ' em a couple stickers like them styles 2040 and 2041 . He says he is coming back in half an hour , on account he 's got an appointment with a brother-in-law of his . " " By the name Robitscher ? " Elkan asked . " That 's the feller , " Polatkin answered . " Ribnik says you promised Robitscher the decorations from the house you are buying . " " What d'ye mean I promised him the decorations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in anguished tones . " In the first place , I ai n't promised him nothing of the kind ; and , in the second place , I ai n't even bought the house yet . " " That part will be fixed up all right , " Polatkin replied , " because Mr. Glaubmann rings up half an hour ago , and he says that so soon as we need him and the lawyer we should telephone for ' em . " For a brief interval Elkan choked with rage . " Say , lookyhere , Mr. Polatkin , " he sputtered at last , " who is going to live in this house  --  you oder me ? " " You are going to live in the house , Elkan , " Polatkin declared , " because me I do n't need a house . I already got one house , Elkan , and I ai n't twins exactly ; and also them fellers is very plain about it , Elkan , which they told me and Scheikowitz up and down , that if you would n't buy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At this juncture Scheikowitz entered the office . From the doorway of the showroom he had observed the discussion between Elkan and his partner ; and he had entirely deserted his prospective customers to aid in Elkan 's coercion . " Polatkin is right , Elkan ! " he cried . " You got to consider Louis Stout also . Kamin said he would never forgive us if the deal did n't go through . " Elkan bit his lips irresolutely . " I do n't see what you are hesitating about , " Polatkin went on . " Yetta likes the house  --  ai n't it ? " " She 's crazy about it , " Elkan admitted . " Then what 's the use talking ? " Scheikowitz declared ; and he glanced anxiously toward Tarnowitz and Kamin , who were holding a whispered conference in the showroom . " Let 's make an end and get the thing over . Telephone this here Glaubmann he should come right over with Ortelsburg and the lawyer . " " But ai n't I going to have no lawyer neither ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scheikowitz replied . " I took a chance , Elkan , and I telephoned Henry D. Feldman half an hour since already . He says he would send one up of his assistants , Mr. Harvey J. Sugarberg , right away . " * * * * * When it came to drawing a real-estate contract there existed for Kent J. Goldstein no incongruities of time and place . Kent was the veteran of a dozen real-estate booms , during which he had drafted agreements at all hours of the day and night , improvising as his office the back room of a liquor saloon or the cigar counter of a barber shop ; and , in default of any other writing material , he was quite prepared to tattoo a brief though binding agreement with gunpowder on the skin of the vendor 's back . Thus the transaction between Glaubmann and Elkan Lubliner presented no difficulties to Kent J. Goldstein ; and he handled the details with such care and dispatch that the contract was nearly finished before Harvey J. Sugarberg remembered the instructions of his principal . As attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice to see that the contract of sale provided every opportunity for his client lawfully to avoid taking title should he desire for any reason , lawful or unlawful , to back out ; and this rule of his principal occurred to Harvey just as he and Goldstein were writing the clause relating to incumbrances . " The premises are to be conveyed free and clear of all incumbrances , " Kent read aloud , " except the mortgage and covenant against nuisances above described and the present tenancies of said premises . " He had brought with him two blank forms of agreement ; and as he filled in the blanks on one of them he read aloud what he was writing and Harvey Sugarberg inserted the same clause in the other . Up to this juncture Harvey had taken Kent 's dictation with such remarkable docility that Elkan and his partners had frequently exchanged disquieting glances , and they were correspondingly elated when Harvey at length balked . " One moment , Mr. Goldstein , " he said  --  and , but for a slight nervousness , he reproduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " as locum tenens for my principal I must decline to insert the phrase , ' and the present tenancies of said premises . ' " Kent wasted no time in forensic dispute when engaged in a real-estate transaction , though , if necessary , he could make kindling of the strongest rail that ever graced the front of a jury-box . " How ' bout it , Glaubmann ? " he said . " The premises is occupied  --  ai n't they ? " Glaubmann flapped his right hand in a gesture of laissez-faire . " The feller moves out by the first of next month , " he said ; and Kent turned to Elkan . " Are you satisfied that the tenant stays in the house until the first ? " he asked . " That will be three days after the contract is closed . " Elkan shrugged his shoulders . " Why not ? " he said . " All right , Mr.  --   --  Forget your name ! " Kent cried . " Cut out ' and the present tenancies of said premises . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed over the faces of Harvey Sugarberg and his clients , and the contract proceeded without further objection to its rapid conclusion . " Now then , my friends , " Kent announced briskly , " we 're ready for the signatures . " At this , the crucial point of all real-estate transactions , a brief silence fell upon the assembled company , which included not only the attorneys and the clients , but Ortelsburg , Kamin , Tarnowitz and Ribnik as well . Finally Glaubmann seized a pen , and , jabbing it viciously in an inkpot , he made a John Hancock signature at the foot of the agreement 's last page . " Now , Mr. Lubliner , " Kent said  --  and Elkan hesitated . " Ai n't we going to wait for Louis Stout ? " he asked ; and immediately there was a roar of protest that sounded like a mob scene in a Drury Lane melodrama . " If Louis Stout ai n't here it 's his own fault , " Ortelsburg declared ; and Ribnik , Tarnowitz , and Kamin glowered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Polatkin murmured . " It is his own fault if he ai n't here , " Scheikowitz agreed feebly ; and , thus persuaded , Elkan appended a small and , by contrast with Glaubmann 's , a wholly unimpressive signature to the agreement . Immediately thereafter Elkan passed over a certified check for eight hundred dollars , according to the terms of the contract , which provided that the title be closed in twenty days at the office of Henry D. Feldman . " Well , Mr. Lubliner , " Glaubmann said , employing the formula hallowed by long usage in all real-estate transactions involving improved property , " I wish you luck in your new house . " " Much obliged , " Elkan said ; and after a general handshaking the entire assemblage crowded into one elevator , so that finally Elkan was left alone with his partners . Polatkin was the first to break a silence of over five minutes ' duration . " Ai n't it funny , " he said , " that we ai n't heard from Louis ? " Scheikowitz nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noisily and there alighted a short , stout person , who , having once been described in the I. O. M. A. Monthly as Benjamin J. Flugel , the Merchant Prince , had never since walked abroad save in a freshly ironed silk hat and a Prince Albert coat . " Why , how do you do , Mr. Flugel ? " Polatkin and Scheikowitz cried with one voice , and Mr. Flugel bowed . Albeit a tumult raged within his breast , he remained outwardly the dignified man of business ; and , as Elkan viewed for the first time Louis Stout 's impressive partner , he could not help congratulating himself on the mercantile sagacity that had made him buy Glaubmann 's house . " And this is Mr. Lubliner ? " Flugel said in even tones . " Pleased to meet you , " Elkan said . " I had dinner with your partner only yesterday . " Flugel gulped convulsively in an effort to remain calm . " I know it , " he said ; " and honestly the longer I am in business with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is . Actually he goes to work and tries to do his own partner without knowing it at all . Mind you , if he would be doing it from spite I could understand it ; but when one partner do n't know that the other partner practically closes a deal for a tract of a hundred lots and six houses in Johnsonhurst , and then persuades a prospective purchaser that , instead of buying in Johnsonhurst , he should buy in Burgess Park , understand me , all I got to say is that if Louis Stout ai n't crazy the least he deserves is that the feller really and truly should buy in Burgess Park . " " But , Mr. Flugel , " Elkan interrupted , " I did buy in Burgess Park . " " What ! " Flugel shouted . " I say that I made a contract for a house out there this morning only , " Elkan said . For a few seconds it seemed as though Benjamin J. Flugel 's heirs-at-law would collect a substantial death benefit from the I. O. M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tremendous burst of profanity . " Aber , Mr. Flugel , " Scheikowitz protested , " Louis tells us only last Saturday , understand me , you told him that Johnsonhurst you would n't touch at all , on account such lowlifes like Rabiner and Pasinsky lives out there ! " " I know I told him that , " Flugel yelled ; " because , if I would say I am going to buy out there , Stout goes to work and blabs it all over the place , and the first thing you know they would jump the price on me a few thousand dollars . He 's a dangerous feller , Louis is , Mr. Scheikowitz ! " Elkan shrugged his shoulders . " That may be , Mr. Flugel , " he said , " but I signed the contract with Glaubmann for his house on Linden Boulevard  --  and that 's all there is to it ! " Polatkin and Scheikowitz nodded in melancholy unison . " Do you got the contract here ? " Flugel asked ; and Elkan picked up the document from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You paid a fancy price for the house , " Flugel continued , as he examined the agreement . " I took your partner 's advice , Mr. Flugel , " Elkan retorted . " Why , for eighteen thousand five hundred dollars , in Johnsonhurst , " Flugel continued , " I could give you a palace already ! " He scanned the various clauses of the contract with the critical eye of an experienced real-estate operator ; and before he had completed his examination the elevator door again creaked open . " Is Glaubmann gone ? " cried a voice from the interior of the car , and the next moment Kovner alighted . Flugel looked up from the contract . " Hello , Kovner , " he said , " are you in this deal too ? " " I ai n't in any deal , " Kovner replied . " I am looking for Barnett Glaubmann . They told me in his office he is coming over here and would be here all the morning . " " Well , he was here , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kovner sat down without invitation . " It ai n't no more as I expected , " he began in the dull , resigned tones of a man with a grievance . " That swindler has been dodging me for four months now , and I guess he will keep on dodging me for the rest of the year that he claims I got a lease on his house for . " " What house ? " Flugel asked . " The house which I am living in it , " Max replied  --  " on Linden Boulevard , Burgess Park . " " On Linden Boulevard , Burgess Park ! " Flugel repeated . " Why , then it 's the same house  --  ai n't it , Lubliner ? " Elkan nodded , and as he did so Flugel struck the desk a tremendous blow with his fist . " Fine ! " he ejaculated . " Fine ! " Kovner repeated . " What the devil you are talking about , fine ? Do you think it 's fine I should got to live a whole year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be spent on it is for plumbing a hundred dollars and for painting a couple hundred more ? " " That 's all right , " Flugel declared with enthusiasm . " It ai n't so bad as it looks ; because if you can show that you got a right to stay in that house for the rest of the year , understand me , I 'll make a proposition to you . " " Show it ? " Kovner exclaimed . " I do n't got to show it , because I could n't help myself , Mr. Flugel . Glaubmann claims that I made a verbal lease for one year , and he 's right . I was fool enough to do so . " Flugel glanced inquiringly at Polatkin and Scheikowitz . " How about that ? " he asked . " The contract do n't say nothing about a year 's lease . " " I know it do n't , " Elkan replied , " because when our lawyer raises the question about the tenant Glaubmann says he could get him out at any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared with emphasis , but Flugel shook his head . " No , he ca n't , Kovner , " he said ; " or , anyway , he ai n't going to , because you are going to stay in that house . " " With the rotten plumbing it 's got ? " Kovner cried . " Not by a whole lot I ai n't . " " The plumbing could be fixed and the painting also , " Flugel retorted . " By Glaubmann ? " Kovner asked . " No , sir , " Flugel replied ; " by me , with a hundred dollars cash to boot . I would even give you an order on my plumber he should fix up the plumbing and on my house painter he should fix up the painting , Kovner ; aber you got to stick it out that you are under lease for the rest of the year . " " And when do I get the work done ? " Kovner demanded . " To-day , " Flugel announced  --  " this afternoon if you want it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Elkan protested . " If I am going to take that house I do n't want no painting done there till I am good and ready . " Flugel smiled loftily at Elkan . " You ai n't going to take that house at all , " he said , " because the contract says that it is to be conveyed free and clear , except the mortgage and a covenant against nuisances . So you reject the title on the grounds that the house is leased for a year . Do you get the idee ? " Elkan nodded . " And next Sunday , " Flugel continued , " I wish you 'd take a run down with me in my oitermobile to Johnsonhurst . It 's an elegant , high-class suburb . " * * * * * Insomnia bears the same relation to the calling of real-estate operators that fossyjaw does to the worker in the match industry ; and , during the twenty days that preceded the closing of his contract with Elkan , Barnett Glaubmann spent many a sleepless night in contemplation of disputed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the knowledge that Henry D. Feldman represented the purchaser was an influence far from sedative ; and what little sleep Glaubmann secured was filled with nightmares of fence encroachments , defects in the legal proceedings for opening of Linden Boulevard as a public highway , and a score of other technical objections that Feldman might raise to free Elkan from his contract . Not once , however , did Glaubmann consider the tenancy of Max Kovner as any objection to title . Indeed , he was so certain of Kovner 's willingness to move out that he even pondered the advisability of gouging Max for twenty-five or fifty dollars as a consideration for accepting a surrender of the verbal lease ; and to that end he avoided the Linden Boulevard house until the morning before the date set for the closing of the title . Then , having observed Max board the eight-five train for Brooklyn Bridge , he sauntered off to interview Mrs. Kovner ; and as he turned the corner of Linden Boulevard he sketched out a plan of action that had for its foundation the complete intimidation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceed to suggest the payment of fifty dollars as the alternative of strong measures against Max Kovner for allowing the Linden Boulevard premises to fall into such bad repair ; and he was so full of his idea that he had begun to ascend the front stoop of the Kovner house before he noticed the odour of fresh paint . Never in the history of the Kovner house had the electric bell been in working order . Hence Glaubmann knocked with his naked fist and left the imprint of his four knuckles on the wet varnish just as Mrs. Kovner flung wide the door . It was at this instant that Glaubmann 's well-laid plans were swept away . " Now see what you done , you dirty slob you ! " she bellowed . " What 's the matter with you ? Could n't you ring the bell ? " " Why , Mrs. Kovner , " Glaubmann stammered , " the bell do n't ring at all . Ai n't it ? " " The bell do n't ring ? " Mrs. Kovner exclaimed . " Who says it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger and a shrill response came from within . " Who fixed it ? " Glaubmann asked . " Who fixed it ? " Mrs. Kovner repeated . " Who do you suppose fixed it ? Do you think we got from charity to fix it ? Gott sei Dank , we ai n't exactly beggars , Mr. Glaubmann . Ourselves we fixed it , Mr. Glaubmann  --  and the painting and the plumbing also ; because if you would got in savings bank what I got it , Mr. Glaubmann , you would n't make us so much trouble about paying for a couple hundred dollars ' repairs . " " Aber , " Glaubmann began , " you should n't of done it ! " " I know we should n't , " Mrs. Kovner replied . " We should of stayed here the rest of the year with the place looking like a pigsty already ! Aber do n't kick till you got to , Mr. Glaubmann . It would be time enough to say something when we sue you by the court yet that you should pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed his hat back from his forehead and wiped his streaming brow . " Nu , Mrs. Kovner , " he said at last , " it seems to me we got a misunderstanding all round here . I would like to talk the matter over with you . " With this conciliatory prelude he assumed an easy attitude by crossing his legs and supporting himself with one hand on the freshly painted doorjamb , whereat Mrs. Kovner uttered a horrified shriek , and the rage which three weeks of housepainters ' clutter had fomented in her bosom burst forth unchecked . " Out from here , you dirty loafer you ! " she shrieked , and grabbed a calcimining brush from one of the many paintpots that bestrewed the hallway . Glaubmann bounded down the front stoop to the sidewalk just as Mrs. Kovner made a frenzied pass at him with the brush ; and consequently , when he entered Kent J. Goldstein 's office on Nassau Street an hour later , his black overcoat was speckled like the hide of an axis deer . " Goldstein , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paints you from head to foot with calcimine ? " " It is if you got witnesses , " Goldstein replied ; " otherwise it 's misfortune . Who did it ? " " That she-devil  --  the wife of the tenant in that house I sold Lubliner , " Glaubmann replied . " I think we 're going to have trouble with them people , Goldstein . " " You will if you try to sue ' em without witnesses , Glaubmann , " Goldstein observed ; " because suing without witnesses is like trying to play pinocle without cards . It ca n't be done . " Glaubmann shook his head sadly . " I ai n't going to sue ' em , " he said . " I ai n't so fond of lawsuits like all that ; and , besides , a little calcimine is nothing , Goldstein , to what them people can do to me . They 're going to claim they got there a year 's verbal lease . " Goldstein shrugged his shoulders . " That 's all right , " he commented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so ; and , with the price you 're getting for the house , Glaubmann , you can afford to pay ' em . " " Gouge nothing ! " Glaubmann declared . " They just got done there a couple hundred dollars ' painting and plumbing , y'understand , and they 're going to stick it out . " Goldstein pursed his lips in an ominous whistle . " A verbal lease , hey ? " he muttered . Glaubmann nodded sadly . " And this time there is witnesses , " he said ; and he related to his attorney the circumstances under which the original lease was made , together with the incident attending Kovner 's visit to Ortelsburg 's house . " It looks like you 're up against it , Glaubmann , " Goldstein declared . " But could n't I claim that I was only bluffing the feller ? " Glaubmann asked . " Sure you could , " Goldstein replied ; " but when Kovner went to work and painted the house and fixed the plumbing he called your bluff , Glaubmann ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adjournment to-morrow . " " And suppose they wo n't give it to us ? " Glaubmann asked . Goldstein shrugged his shoulders . " I 'm a lawyer , Glaubmann  --  not a prophet , " he said ; " but if I know Henry D. Feldman you wo n't get any adjournment  --  so you may as well make your plans accordingly . " For a brief interval Glaubmann nodded his head slowly , and then he burst into a mirthless laugh . " Real estate , " he said , " that 's something to own . Rheumatism is a fine asset compared to it ; in fact if some one gives me my choice , Goldstein , I would say rheumatism every time . Both of ' em keep you awake nights ; but there 's one thing about rheumatism , Goldstein "  --  here he indulged in another bitter laugh  --  " you do n't need a lawyer to get rid of it ! " he said , and banged the door behind him . * * * * * If there was any branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was conveyancing , and he brought to it all the histrionic ability that made him so formidable as a trial lawyer . Indeed , Feldman was accustomed to treat the conveyancing department of his office as a business-getter for the more lucrative field of litigation , and he spared no pains to make each closing of title an impressive and dramatic spectacle . Thus the mise-en-scene of the Lubliner closing was excellent . Feldman himself sat in a baronial chair at the head of his library table , while to a seat on his right he had assigned Kent J. Goldstein . On his left he had placed Mr. Jones , the representative of the title company , a gaunt , sandy-haired man of thirty-five who , by the device of a pair of huge horn spectacles , had failed to distract public attention from an utterly stupendous Adam 's apple . Next to the title company 's representative were placed Elkan Lubliner and his partners , and it was to them that Henry D. Feldman addressed his opening remarks . " Mr. Lubliner , " he said in the soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the examination of the record title to Mr. Glaubmann 's Linden Boulevard premises has been made at my request by the Law Title Insurance and Guaranty Company . " He made a graceful obeisance toward Mr. Jones , who acknowledged it with a convulsion of his Adam 's apple . " I have also procured a survey to be made , " Feldman continued ; and , amid a silence that was broken only by the heavy breathing of Barnett Glaubmann , he held up an intricate design washed with watercolour on glazed muslin . " Finally I have done this , " he declared , and his brows gathered in a tragic frown as his glance swept in turn the faces of Kent J. Goldstein , Benno Ortelsburg , J. Kamin , and Glaubmann  --  " I have procured an inspector 's report upon the occupation of the locus in quo . " " Oo-ee ! " Glaubmann murmured , and Louis Stout exchanged triumphant glances with Polatkin and Scheikowitz . " And I find , " Feldman concluded , " there is a tenant in possession , claiming under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first next . " Mr. Jones nodded and cleared his throat so noisily that , to relieve his embarrassment , he felt obliged to crack each of his knuckles in turn . As for Ribnik and Tarnowitz , they sat awestruck in the rear of Feldman 's spacious library and felt vaguely that they were in a place of worship . Only Kent J. Goldstein remained unimpressed ; and in order to show it he scratched a parlour match on the leg of Feldman 's library table ; whereat Feldman 's ex-cathedra manner forsook him . " Where in blazes do you think you are , Goldstein ? " he asked in colloquial tones  --  " in a barroom ? " " If it 's solid mahogany , " Goldstein retorted , " it 'll rub up like new . I think you were talking about the tenancy of the premises here . " Feldman choked down his indignation and once more became the dignified advocate . " That is not the only objection to title , Mr. Goldstein , " he said . " Mr. Jones , kindly read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Jones nodded again and responded to Feldman 's demand in a voice that profoundly justified the size of his larynx . " Description in deed dated January 1 , 1783 , " he began , " from Joost van Gend to William Wauters , is defective ; one course reading ' thence along said ditch north to a white-oak tree ' should be ' south to a white-oak tree . ' " " Well , what 's the difference ? " Goldstein interrupted . " It 's monumented by the white-oak tree . " " That was cut down long ago , " Mr. Jones said . " Not by me ! " Glaubmann declared . " I give you my word , gentlemen , the trees on the lot is the same like I bought it . " Feldman allowed his eyes to rest for a moment on the protesting Glaubmann , who literally crumpled in his chair . " Proceed , Mr. Jones , " Feldman said to the title company 's representative , who continued without further interruption to the end of his list . This included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as a novel and interesting point concerning a partition suit in Chancery , brought in 1819 , and affecting Glaubmann 's chain of title to a strip in the rear of his lot , measuring one quarter of an inch in breadth by seven feet in length . " So far as I can see , Feldman , " Goldstein commented as Mr. Jones laid down his report , " the only objection that will hold water is the one concerning Max Kovner 's tenancy . As a matter of fact , I have witnesses to show that Kovner has always claimed that he did n't hold a lease . " For answer , Feldman touched the button of an electric bell . " Show in Mr. and Mrs. Kovner , " he said to the boy who responded . " We 'll let them speak for themselves . " This , it would appear , they were more than willing to do ; for as soon as they entered the room and caught sight of Glaubmann , who by this time was fairly cowering in his chair , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goldstein banged vigorously on the library table , using as a gavel one of Feldman 's metal-tipped rulers . " That 'll do , Goldstein ! " Feldman said hoarsely . " I think I can preserve order in my own office . " " Why do n't you then ? " Goldstein retorted , as he leaned back in his chair and regarded with a malicious smile the damage he had wrought . " Yes , Mr. Glaubmann , " Kovner began anew , " you thought you got us helpless there in your house ; but  --   --  " " Shut up ! " Feldman roared again , forgetting his role of the polished advocate ; and Goldstein fairly beamed with satisfaction . " Do n't bully your own witness , " he said . " Let me do it for you . " He turned to Kovner with a beetling frown . " Now , Kovner , " he commenced , " you claim you 've got a verbal lease for a year of this Linden Boulevard house , do n't you ? " " I sure do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove it . " " That 's all right , " Goldstein rejoined ; " so long as there 's Bibles there 'll always be witnesses to swear on ' em . The point is : How do you claim the lease was made ? " " I do n't claim nothing , " Kovner replied . " I got a year 's lease on that property because , in the presence of my wife and his wife , Mr. Goldstein , he says to me I must either take the house for a year from last October to next October or I could n't take it at all . " Feldman smiled loftily at his opponent . " The art of cross-examination is a subtle one , Goldstein , " he said , " and if you do n't understand it you 're apt to prove the other fellow 's case . " " Nevertheless , " Goldstein continued , " I 'm going to ask him one more question , and that is this : When was this verbal agreement made  --  before or after you moved into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly , " Kovner answered . " I told you that he says to me I could n't move in unless I would agree to take the place for a year . " " And when did you move in ? " Goldstein continued . " On the first of October , " Kovner said . " No , popper , " Mrs. Kovner interrupted ; " we did n't move in on the first . We moved in the day before . " " That 's right , " Kovner said  --  " we moved in on the thirtieth of September . " " So , " Goldstein declared , " you made a verbal agreement before September thirtieth for a lease of one year from October first ? " Kovner nodded and Goldstein turned to Henry D. Feldman , whose lofty smile had completely disappeared . " Well , Feldman , " he said , " you pulled a couple of objections on me from ' way back in the last century , understand me ; so I guess it wo n't hurt if I remind you of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which says : ' All contracts which by their terms are not to be performed within one year must be in writing and signed by the party to be charged . ' I mean the Statute of Frauds . " " I know what you mean all right , " Feldman replied ; " but you 'll have to prove that before a court and jury . Just now we are confronted with Kovner , who claims to have a year 's lease ; and my client is relieved from his purchase in the circumstances . No man is bound to buy a lawsuit , Goldstein . " " I know he ai n't , " Goldstein retorted ; " but what 's the difference , Feldman ? He 'll have a lawsuit on his hands , anyhow , because if he do n't take title now , understand me , I 'll bring an action to compel him to do so this very afternoon . " At this juncture a faint croaking came from the vicinity of Louis Stout , who throughout had been as appreciative a listener as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his seat from a speculator . " Speak up , Mr. Stout ! " Feldman cried . " I was saying , " Louis replied faintly , " that with my own ears I heard Glaubmann say to Kovner that he 's got a verbal lease for one year . " " And when was this ? " Feldman asked . " About three weeks ago , " Stout replied . " Then , in that case , Mr. Goldstein , " Feldman declared , " let me present to you another proposition of law . " He paused to formulate a sufficiently impressive " offer " as the lawyers say , and in the silence that followed Elkan shuffled to his feet . " It ai n't necessary , Mr. Feldman , " he said . " I already made up my mind about it . " " About what ? " Louis Stout exclaimed . " About taking the house , " Elkan replied . " If you 'll let me have the figures , Mr. Feldman , I 'll draw a check and have it certified and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elkan , " Louis cried , " first let me communicate with Flugel . " " That ai n't necessary neither , " Elkan retorted . " I 'm going to make an end right here and now ; and you should be so good , Mr. Feldman , and fix me up the statement of what I owe here . I want to get through . " Polatkin rose shakily to his feet . " What 's the matter , Elkan ? " he said huskily . " Are you crazy , oder what ? " " Sit down , Mr. Polatkin , " Elkan commanded , and there was a ring of authority in his tone that made Polatkin collapse into his chair . " I am buying this house . " " But , Elkan , " Louis Stout implored , " why do n't you let me talk to Flugel over the ' phone ? Might he would got a suggestion to make maybe . " " That 's all right , " Elkan said . " The only suggestion he makes is that if I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never buy another dollar 's worth of goods from us so long as he lives . So you should n't bother to ring him up , Mr. Stout . " Louis Stout flushed angrily . " So far as that goes , Lubliner , " he says , " I do n't got to ring up Mr. Flugel to tell you the same thing , so you know what you could do . " " Sure I know what I could do , " Elkan continued . " I could either do business like a business man or do business like a muzhik , Mr. Stout . Aber this ai n't Russland , Mr. Stout  --  this is America ; and if I got to run round wiping people 's shoes to sell goods , then I do n't want to do it at all . " J. Kamin took a cigar out of his mouth and spat vigorously . " You 're dead right , Elkan , " he said . " Go ahead and close the contract and I assure you you would n't regret it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You assure me ! " he said . " Who in thunder are you ? Do you think I 'm looking for your business now , Kamin ? Why , if you was worth your salt as a merchant , understand me , instead you would be fooling away your time trying to make a share of a commission , which the most you would get out of it is a hundred dollars , y'understand , you would be attending to your business buying your spring line . You are wasting two whole days on this deal , Kamin ; and if two business days out of your spring buying is only worth a hundred dollars to you , Kamin , go ahead and get your goods somewheres else than in our store . I do n't need to be Dun or Bradstreet to get a line on you , Kamin  --  and do n't you forget it ! " At this juncture a faint cough localized Joel Ribnik , who had remained with Julius Tarnowitz in the obscurity cast by several bound volumes of digests and reports . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are a millionaire concern , the way your partner talks ! Might you do n't need our business , neither , maybe ? " Polatkin was busy checking the ravages made upon his linen by the perspiration that literally streamed down his face and neck ; but Scheikowitz , who had listened open-mouthed to Elkan 's pronunciamento , straightened up in his chair and his face grew set with determination . " We ai n't millionaires , Mr. Ribnik , " he said  --  " far from it ; and we ai n't never going to be , understand me , if we got to buy eighteen-thousand dollar houses for every bill of goods we sell to Schnorrers and deadbeats ! " " Scheikowitz ! " Polatkin pleaded . " Never mind , Polatkin , " Scheikowitz declared . " The boy is right , Polatkin ; and if we are making our living in America we got to act like Americans  --  not peasants . So , go ahead , Stout . Telephone Flugel and tell him from me that if he wants to take it that way he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and that 's all there is to it ! " " Then I apprehend , gentlemen , that we had better proceed to close , " Feldman said ; and Elkan nodded , for as Scheikowitz finished speaking a ball had risen in Elkan 's throat which , blink as he might , he could not down for some minutes . " All right , Goldstein , " Feldman continued . " Let 's fix up the statement of closing . " " One moment , gentlemen , " Max Kovner said . " Do I understand that , if Elkan Lubliner buys the house to-day , we 've got to move out ? " Feldman raised his eyebrows . " I think Mr. Goldstein will agree with me , Kovner , when I say you have n't a leg to stand on , " he declared . " You 're completely out of court on your own testimony . " " You mean we ai n't got a lease for a year ? " Mrs. Kovner asked . " That 's right , " Goldstein replied . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them verfluchte painters and all ! " she wailed . " What do you think I am anyway ? " " Well , if you do n't want to move right away , " Elkan began , " when would it be convenient for you to get out , Mrs. Kovner ? " " I do n't want to get out at all , " she whimpered . " Why should I want to get out ? The house is an elegant house , which I just planted yesterday string beans and tomatoes ; and the parlor looks elegant now we got the old paper off . " " Supposing we say the first of May , " Elkan suggested  --  " not that I am so crazy to move out to Burgess Park , y'understand ; but I do n't see what is the sense buying a house in the country and then not living in it . " There was a brief silence , broken only by the soft weeping of Mrs. Kovner ; and at length Max Kovner shrugged his shoulders . " Nu , Elkan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bushes round ? Mrs. Kovner is stuck on the house and so am I. So long as you do n't want the house , and there 's been so much trouble about it and all , I tell you what I 'll do : Take back two thousand dollars a second mortgage on the house , payable in one year at six per cent. , which it is so good as gold , understand me , and I 'll relieve you of your contract and give you two hundred dollars to boot . " A smile spread slowly over Elkan 's face as he looked significantly at Louis Stout . " I do n't want your two hundred dollars , Max , " he said . " You can have the house and welcome ; and you should use the two hundred to pay your painting and plumbing bills . " " That 's all right , " Louis Stout said ; " there is people which will see to it that he does . Also , gentlemen , I want everybody to understand that I claim full commission here from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nu , gentlemen , " Glaubmann said ; " I 'll leave this to the lawyers if it ai n't so : From one transaction I can only be liable for one commission  --  ai n't it ? " Feldman and Goldstein nodded in unison . " Then all I could say is that yous brokers and drygoods merchants should fight it out between yourselves , " he declared ; " because I 'm going to pay the money for the commission into court  --  and them which is entitled to it can have it . " " But ai n't you going to protect me , Glaubmann ? " Ortelsburg demanded . Glaubmann raised his hand for silence . " One moment , Ortelsburg , " he said . " I think it was you and Kamin told me that real estate is a game the same like auction pinocle ? " Ortelsburg nodded sulkily . " Then you fellers should go ahead and play it , " Glaubmann concluded . " And might the best man win ! " B Footnote B : In the face of numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes of this story that a verbal lease for one year , to commence in the future , is void . CHAPTER SIX A TALE OF TWO JACOBEAN CHAIRS NOT A DETECTIVE STORY " Yes , Mr. Lubliner , " said Max Merech as he sat in the front parlour of Elkan 's flat one April Sunday ; " if you are going to work to buy furniture , understand me , it 's just so easy to select good-looking chairs as bad-looking chairs . " " Aber sometimes it 's a whole lot harder to sit on ' em comfortably , " Elkan retorted sourly . On the eve of moving to a larger apartment he and Yetta had invited Max to suggest a plan for furnishing and decorating their new dwelling ; and it seemed to Elkan that Max had taken undue advantage of the privilege thus accorded him . Indeed , Polatkin , Scheikowitz &amp; Company 's aesthetic designer held such pronounced views on interior decoration , and had expressed them so freely to Elkan and Yetta , that after the first half-hour of his visit the esteem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilton rugs had changed  --  first to indifference and then , in the case of Yetta , at least , to loathing . " I always told you that the couch over there was hideous , Elkan , " Yetta said . " Hideous it ai n't , " Max interrupted ; " aber it ai n't so beautiful . " " Well , stick the couch in the bedroom , then , " Elkan said . " It makes no difference to me . " " Sure , I know , " Yetta exclaimed : " but what would we put in its place ? " Elkan shrugged his shoulders . " What d'ye ask me for ? " Elkan cried . " Like as not I 'd say another couch . " " There is couches and couches , " Max said with an apologetic smile , " but if you would ask my advice I would say why not a couple nice chairs there  --  something in monhogany , like Shippendaler oder Sheratin . " Suddenly he slapped his thigh in an access of inspiration . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got the very thing you want  --  and a big bargain too ! Do you know Louis Dishkes , which runs the Villy dee Paris Store in Amsterdam Avenue ? " " I think I know him , " Elkan said with ironic emphasis . " He owes us four hundred dollars for two months already . " " Well , Dishkes is got a brother-in-law by the name Ringentaub , on Allen Street , which he is a dealer in antics . " " Antics ? " Elkan exclaimed . " Sure ! " Max explained . " Antics  --  old furniture and old silver . " " You mean a second-hand store ? " Elkan suggested . " Not a second-hand store , " Max declared . " A second-hand store is got old furniture from two years old oder ten years old , understand me ; aber an antic store carries old furniture from a hundred years old already . " " And this here Ringentaub is got furniture from a hundred years old already ? " Elkan cried . " From older even , " answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also . " " Ich glaub 's ! " Elkan cried . " You can believe it oder not , Mr. Lubliner , " Max continued ; " but Ringentaub got in his store a couple Jacobean chairs , which they are two hundred and fifty years old already . And them chairs you could buy at a big sacrifice yet . " Elkan and Yetta exchanged puzzled glances , and Elkan even tapped his forehead significantly . " They was part of a whole set , " Max went on , not noticing his employer 's gesture ; " the others Ringentaub sold to a collector . " Elkan flipped his right hand . " A collector is something else again , " he said ; " but me I ai n't no collector , Max , Gott sei Dank ! I got my own business , Max , and I ai n't got to buy from two hundred and fifty years old furniture . " " Why not ? " Max asked . " B. Gans is got his own business , too , Mr. Lubliner , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  only last week already  --  an angry cat cabinet which it is three hundred years old already . " " An angry cat cabinet ? " Elkan exclaimed . " That 's what I said , " Max continued ; " ' angry ' is French for ' Henry ' and ' cat ' is French for ' fourth ' ; so this here cabinet was made three hundred years ago when Henry the Fourth was king of France  --  and B. Gans buys it last week already for five hundred dollars ! " Therewith Max commenced a half-hour dissertation upon antique furniture which left Yetta and Elkan more undecided than ever . " And you are telling me that big people like B. Gans and Andrew Carnegie buys this here antics for their houses ? " Elkan asked . " J. P. Morgan also , " Max replied . " And them Jacobean chairs there you could get for fifty dollars already . " " Well , it would n't do no harm supposing we would go down and see ' em , " Yetta suggested . " Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week after . " " For that matter , we could go to-night too , " Max rejoined . " Sunday is like any other night down on Allen Street , and you got to remember that Jacobean chairs is something which you could n't get whenever you want ' em . Let me tell you just what they look like . " Here he descanted so successfully on the beauty of Jacobean furniture that Yetta added her persuasion to his , and Elkan at length surrendered . " All right , " he said . " First we would have a little something to eat and then we would go down there . " Hence , a few minutes after eight that evening they alighted at the Spring Street subway station ; and Max Merech piloted Elkan and Yetta beneath elevated railroads and past the windows of brass shops , with their gleaming show of candlesticks and samovars , to a little basement store near the corner of Rivington Street . " It do n't look like much , " Max apologized as he descended the few steps leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegant stock inside . " When he opened the door a trigger affixed to the door knocked against a rusty bell , but no one responded . Instead , from behind a partition in the rear came sounds of an angry dispute ; and as Elkan closed the door behind him one of the voices rose higher than the rest . " Take my life  --  take my blood , Mr. Sammet ! " it said ; " because I am making you the best proposition I can , and that 's all there is to it . " Max was about to stamp his foot when Elkan laid a restraining hand on his shoulder ; and , in the pause that followed , the heavy , almost hysterical breathing of the last speaker could be heard in the front of the store . " I do n't want your life oder your blood , Dishkes , " came the answer in bass tones , which Elkan recognized as the voice of his competitor , Leon Sammet . " I am your heaviest creditor , and all I want is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are my heaviest creditor , " Louis Dishkes replied . " To my sorrow I know it ! If it would n't be for your rotten stickers which I got in my place , might I would be doing a good business there to-day , maybe ! " " Schmooes , Dishkes ! " Sammet replied . " The reason you did n't done a good business there is that you ai n't no business man , Dishkes  --  and anyhow , Dishkes , it do n't do no good you should insult me ! " " What d'ye mean insult you ? " Dishkes cried angrily . " I ai n't insulting you , Sammet . You are insulting me . You want me I should protect you and let my other creditors go to the devil  --  ai n't it ? What d'ye take me for  --  a crook ? " " That 's all right , " Sammet declared . " I would n't dandy words with you , Dishkes . For the last time I am asking you : Will you take advantage of the offer I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nashville , for your entire stock ? Otherwise I would got nothing more to say to you . " There was a sound of scuffling feet as the party in the rear of the store rose from their chairs . " You ai n't got no need to say nothing more to me , Mr. Sammet , " Dishkes announced firmly , " because I am through with you , Mr. Sammet . Your account ai n't due till to-morrow , and you could n't do nothing till Tuesday . Ai n't it ? So Tuesday morning early you should go ahead and sue me , and if I could n't raise money there is to it . " As Dishkes finished speaking Elkan drew Max and Yetta into the shadow cast by a tall highboy ; and , without noticing their presence , Leon Sammet plunged toward the door and let himself out into the street . Immediately Elkan tiptoed to the door and threw it wide open , after which he shuffled his feet with sufficient noise to account for the entrance of three people . Thereat Ringentaub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Max cried . " I am bringing you here some customers . " Ringentaub bowed and coughed a warning to Dishkes and Mrs. Ringentaub , who continued to talk in hoarse whispers behind the partition . " What 's the matter , Ringentaub ? " Max Merech asked ; " could n't you afford it here somehow a little light ? " Ringentaub reached into the upper darkness and turned on a gas jet which had been burning a blue point of flame . " I keep it without light here on purpose , " he said , " on account Sundays is a big night for the candlestick fakers up the street and I do n't want to be bothered with their trade . What could I show your friends , Mr. Merech ? " Max winked almost imperceptibly at Elkan and prepared to approach the subject of the Jacobean chairs by a judicious detour . " Do you got maybe a couple Florentine frames , Ringentaub ? " he asked ; and Ringentaub shook his head . " Florentine frames is hard to find nowadays , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told it you Friday that I ai n't got none . " Elkan shrugged his shoulders and smiled . " I thought might you would of picked up a couple since then , maybe , " Max rejoined , glancing round him . " You got a pretty nice highboy over there , Ringentaub , for a reproduction . " Ringentaub nodded satirically . " That only goes to show how much you know about such things , Mr. Merech , " he retorted , " when you are calling reproductions something which it is a gen-wine Shippendaler , understand me , in elegant condition . " It was now Elkan 's turn to nod , and he did so with just the right degree of skepticism as at last he broached the object of his visit . " I suppose , " he said , " that them chairs over there is also gen-wine Jacobean chairs ? " * * * * * " I 'll tell you what I 'll do with you , Mr. Merech , " Ringentaub declared . " You could bring down here any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand me , or any conoozer you want to name , like Jacob Paul , oder anybody , y'understand ; and if they would say them chairs ai n't gen-wine Jacobean I 'll make ' em a present to you free for nothing . " " I ai n't schnorring for no presents , Mr. Ringentaub , " Max declared . " Bring ' em out in the light and let 's give a look at ' em . " Ringentaub drew the chairs into the centre of the floor , and placing them beneath the gas jet he stepped backward and tilted his head to one side in silent admiration . " Nu , Mr. Merech , " he said at last , " am I right or am I wrong ? Is the chairs gen-wine oder not ? I leave it to your friends here . " Max turned to Elkan , who had been edging away toward the partition , from which came scraps of conversation between Dishkes and Mrs. Ringentaub . " What do you think , Mr. Lubliner ? " Max asked ; and Elkan frowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun to catch a few words of the conversation in the rear room . " Sure  --  sure ! " he said absently . " I leave it to you and Mrs. Lubliner . " Yetta 's face had fallen as she viewed the apparently decayed and rickety furniture . " Ai n't they terrible shabby-looking ! " she murmured , and Ringentaub shrugged his shoulders and smiled . " You would look shabby , too , lady , " he said , " if you would be two hundred and fifty years old ; aber if you want to see what they look like after they are restored , y'understand , I got back there one of the rest of the set which I already sold to Mr. Paul ; and I am fixing it up for him . " As he finished speaking he walked to the rear and dragged forward a reseated and polished duplicate of the two chairs . " I dassent restore ' em before I sell ' em , " Ringentaub explained ; " otherwise no one believes they are gen-wine . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ringentaub ? " Max asked . " I did n't say I wanted nothing , " Ringentaub replied . " The fact is , I do n't know whether I want to keep them chairs oder not . You see , Mr. Merech , Jacobean chairs is pretty near so rare nowadays that it would pay me to wait a while . In a couple of years them chairs double in value already . " " Sure , I know , " Max said . " You could say the same thing about your whole stock , Ringentaub ; and so , if I would be you , Ringentaub , I would take a little vacation of a couple years or so . Go round the world mit Mrs. Ringentaub , understand me , and by the time you come back you are worth twicet as much as you got to-day ; but just to help pay your rent while you are away , Mr. Ringentaub , I 'll make you an offer of thirty-five dollars for the chairs . " Ringentaub seized a chair in each hand and dragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , " he announced , " I ai n't got no Florentine frames , Mr. Merech ; so I am sorry we could n't do no business . " " Well , then , thirty-seven-fifty , Mr. Ringentaub , " Max continued ; and Ringentaub made a flapping gesture with both hands . " Say , lookyhere , " he growled , " what is the use talking nonsense , Mr. Merech ? For ten dollars apiece you could get on Twenty-third Street a couple chairs , understand me , made in some big factory , y'understand  --  A-Number-One pieces of furniture  --  which would suit you a whole lot better as gen-wine pieces . These here chairs is for conoozers , Mr. Merech ; so , if you want any shiny candlesticks oder Moskva samovars from brass-spinners on Center Street , y'understand , a couple doors uptown you would find plenty fakers . Aber here is all gen-wine stuff , y'understand ; and for gen-wine stuff you got to pay full price , understand me , which if them chairs stays in my store till they are five hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ' em as fifty dollars . " Max turned inquiringly to Mrs. Lubliner ; and , during the short pause that followed , the agonized voice of Louis Dishkes came once more from the back room . " What could I do ? " he said to Mrs. Ringentaub . " I want to be square mit everybody , and I must got to act quick on account that sucker Sammet will close me up sure . " " Ai , tzuris ! " Mrs. Ringentaub moaned ; at which her husband coughed noisily and Elkan moved nearer to the partition . " Would you go as high as fifty dollars , Mrs. Lubliner ? " Max asked , and Yetta nodded . " All right , Mr. Ringentaub , " Max concluded ; " we 'll take ' em at fifty dollars . " " And you would n't regret it neither , " Ringentaub replied . " I 'll make you out a bill right away . " He darted into the rear room and slammed the partition door behind him . " Koosh , Dishkes ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all  --  blabbing out your business in front of all them strangers ? " It was at this juncture that Elkan rapped on the door . " Excuse me , Mr. Ringentaub , " he said , " but I ai n't no stranger to Mr. Dishkes  --  not by four hundred dollars already . " He opened the door as he spoke , and Dishkes , who was sitting at a table with his head bowed on his hands , looked up mournfully . " Nu , Mr. Lubliner ! " he said . " You are after me , too , ai n't it ? " Elkan shook his head . " Not only I ai n't after you , Dishkes , " he said , " but I did n't even know you was in trouble until just now . " " And you never would of known , " Ringentaub added , " if he ai n't been such a dummer Ochs and listened to people 's advice . He got a good chance to sell out , and he would n't took it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to an auction house ; the idee being to run away mit the proceeds and leave his creditors in the lurches ! " Dishkes again buried his head in his hands , while Ringentaub blushed guiltily . " That may be all right in the antic business , Mr. Ringentaub , " Elkan went on , " but in the garment business we ai n't two hundred and fifty years behind the times exactly . We got associations of manufacturers and we got good lawyers , too , understand me ; and we get right after crooks like Sammet , just the same as some of us helps out retailers that want to be decent , like Dishkes here . " Louis Dishkes raised his head suddenly . " Then you heard the whole thing ? " he cried ; and Elkan nodded . " I heard enough , Dishkes , " he said ; " and if you want my help you could come down to my place to-morrow morning at ten o'clock . " At this juncture the triggered bell rang loudly , and raising his hand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how do you do , Mr. Paul ! " he said . He addressed a broad-shouldered figure arrayed in the height of Canal Street fashion . Aside from his clothing , however , there was little to betray the connoisseur of fine arts and antiques in the person of Jacob Paul , who possessed the brisk , businesslike manner and steel-blue eyes of a detective sergeant . " Hello , Ringentaub ! " he said . " You are doing a rushing business here  --  ai n't it ? More customers in the back room too ? " He glanced sharply at the open doorway in the partition , through which Elkan and Dishkes could be seen engaged in earnest conversation . " Yow  --  customers ! " Ringentaub exclaimed . " You know how it is in the antic business , Mr. Paul . For a hundred that looks , understand me , one buys ; and that one , Mr. Paul , he comes into your place a dozen times before he makes up his mind yet . " " Well , " Paul said with a smile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ringentaub , and I 'll take them other two chairs at forty-five dollars . " Ringentaub nodded his head slowly . " I thought you would , Mr. Paul , " he said ; " but just the same you are a little late , on account this here gentleman already bought ' em for fifty dollars . " A shade of disappointment passed over Paul 's face as he turned to Max Merech . " I congratulate you , Mister  --   --  " " Merech , " Max suggested . " Merech , " Paul continued . " You paid a high price for a couple of good pieces . " " I ai n't paying nothing , " Max replied . " I bought ' em for this lady here and her husband . " It was then that Jacob Paul for the first time noticed Yetta 's presence , and he bowed apologetically . " Is he also a collector ? " he asked , and Max shook his head . " He 's in the garment business , " Yetta volunteered , " for himself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess I ai n't caught the name , " he said . " Lubliner , " Yetta replied ; " Elkan Lubliner , of Polatkin , Scheikowitz &amp; Company . " " You do n't tell me ? " Jacob Paul said . " And so Mr. Lubliner is interested in antiques . That 's quite a jump , from cloaks and suits to antiques already . " " Well , " Merech explained , " Mr. Lubliner is refurnishing his house . " " Maybe , " Elkan added as he appeared in the doorway of the partition , followed by Dishkes and Mrs. Ringentaub . " Buying a couple pieces of furniture is one thing , Merech , and refurnishing your house is another . " " You made a good start anyhow , " Paul interrupted . " A couple chairs like them gives a tone to a room which is got crayon portraits hanging in it even . " Yetta blushed in the consciousness of what she had always considered to be a fine likeness of Elkan 's grandfather  --  the Lubliner Rav  --  which hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front parlour . Elkan was unashamed , however , and he glared angrily at the connoisseur , who had started to leave the store . " I suppose , " he cried , " it ai n't up to date that a feller should have hanging in his flat a portrait of his grandfather  --  olav hasholem !  --  which he was a learned man and a Tzadek , if there ever was one . " Paul hesitated , with his hand on the doorknob . " I 'll tell you , Mr. Lubliner , " he said solemnly ; " to me a crayon portrait is rotten , understand me , if it would be of a Tzadek oder a murderer . " And with a final bow to Mrs. Lubliner he banged the door behind him . " Well , what d'ye think for a Rosher like that ? " Elkan exclaimed . " The fellow is disappointed that you got ahead of him buying the chairs , Mr. Lubliner , " Ringentaub explained ; " so he takes a chance that you and Mrs. Lubliner is that kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portraits , understand me , and he knocks you for it . " Elkan shrugged his shoulders . " What could you expect from a feller which is content at fifty years of age to be a collector only ? " he asked , and Dishkes nodded sympathetically . " I bet yer , Mr. Lubliner , " he agreed ; " and so I would be at your store to-morrow morning at ten o'clock sure . " * * * * * " I do n't doubt your word for a minute , Elkan , " Marcus Polatkin said the following morning when Elkan related to him the events of the preceding night ; " aber you could n't blame Sammet none . Concerns like Sammet Brothers , which they are such dirty crooks that everybody is got suspicions of ' em , y'understand , must got to pay their bills prompt to the day , Elkan ; because if they would n't be themselves good collectors , understand me , they would bust up quick . " " Sammet Brothers ai n't in no danger of busting up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marcus rejoined . " Well , you would be surprised , Elkan , if I would tell you that only yesterday already I am speaking to a feller by the name Hirsch , which works for years by the Hamsuckett Mills as city salesman , understand me , and he says that the least Sammet Brothers owes them people is ten thousand dollars . " " That shows what a big business they must do , " Elkan said . " Yow  --  a big business ! " Marcus concluded . " This here Hirsch says not only Sammet Brothers ' business falls off something terrible , y'understand , but they are also getting to be pretty slow pay ; and if it would n't be that the Hamsuckett people is helping ' em along , verstehst du , they would of gone up schon long since already . " " And a good job too , " Elkan said . " The cloak-and-suit trade could worry along without ' em , Mr. Polatkin ; but anyhow , Mr. Polatkin , I ai n't concerned with Sammet Brothers . The point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand there on Amsterdam Avenue , and if he could only hold on a couple months longer he would n't got no difficulty in pulling through . " Polatkin shrugged his shoulders . " For my part , " he said , " it would n't make no difference if Dishkes busts up now oder two months from now . " " But the way he tells me yesterday , " Elkan replied , " not only he would n't got to bust up on us if he gets his two months ' extension , but he says he would be doing a good business at that time . " Polatkin nodded skeptically . " Sure , I know , Elkan , " he said . " If everybody which is asking an extension would do the business they hope to do before the extension is up , Elkan , " he said , " all the prompt-pay fellows must got to close up shop on account there would n't be enough business to go round . " " Well , anyhow , " Elkan rejoined , " he 's coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he could show you how he figures it that he 's got hopes to pull through . " Polatkin made a deprecatory gesture with his hand . " If a feller is going to bust up on me , Elkan , I 'd just as lief he ai n't got no hopes at all , " he grumbled ; " otherwise he wastes your whole day on you figuring out his next season 's profits if he can only stall off his creditors . With such a hoping feller , if you do n't want to be out time as well as money , understand me , you should quick file a petition in bankruptcy against him ; otherwise he would n't give you no peace at all . " Nevertheless , when Dishkes arrived , half an hour later , Polatkin ushered him into the firm 's office and summoned Scheikowitz and Elkan to the conference . " Well , Dishkes , " he said in kindly accents , " you are up against it . " Dishkes nodded . He was by no means of a robust physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fumbled for his papers in his breast pocket that he dropped its contents on the office floor . Elkan stooped to assist in retrieving the scattered papers , and among the documents he gathered together was a cabinet photograph . " My wife ! " Dishkes murmured hoarsely . " She ai n't so strong , and I am sending her up to the country a couple months ago . I 've been meaning I should go up and see her ever since , but  --   --  " Here he gulped dismally ; and there was an embarrassed silence , broken only by the faint noise occasioned by Philip Scheikowitz scratching his chin . " That 's a Rosher  --  that feller Sammet , " Polatkin said at length . " Honestly , the way some business men ai n't got no mercy at all for the other feller , you would think , Scheikowitz , they was living back in the old country yet ! " Scheikowitz nodded and glanced nervously from the photograph to Elkan . " I think you was telling me you got a couple idees about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So , in the first place , Dishkes , you should please let us see a list of your creditors . " With this prelude Scheikowitz drew forward his chair and plunged into a discussion of Dishkes ' affairs that lasted for more than two hours ; and when Dishkes at length departed he took with him notices of a meeting addressed to his twenty creditors , prepared for immediate mailing by Polatkin , Scheikowitz &amp; Company 's stenographer . " And that 's what we let ourselves in for , " Scheikowitz declared after the elevator door had closed behind Dishkes . " To-morrow morning at eleven o'clock the place here would look like the waiting room of a depot , and all our competitors would be rubbering at our stock already . " " Let ' em rubber ! " Elkan said . " If I do n't get an extension for that feller my name ai n't Elkan Lubliner at all ; because between now and then I am going round to see them twenty creditors , and I bet yer they will sign an extension agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them ! " " Figures ! " Scheikowitz jeered . " What good is figures to them fellers ? Showing figures to a bankrupt 's creditors is like taking to a restaurant a feller which is hungry and letting him look at the knives and forks and plates , understand me ! " Elkan nodded . " Sure , I know , " he said ; " but the figures ai n't all . " Surreptitiously he drew from his pocket a faded cabinet photograph . " I sneaked this away from Dishkes when he was n't noticing , " Elkan declared ; " and if this do n't fix ' em nothing will ! " * * * * * " Say , lookyhere , Lubliner , " Leon Sammet cried after Elkan had broached the reason for his visit late that afternoon , " do n't give me that tale of woe again . Every time we are asking Dishkes for money he pulls this here sick-wife story on us , understand me ; and it do n't go down with me no more . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elkan demanded . " Do you claim his wife ai n't sick ? " " I do n't claim nothing , " Sammet retorted . " I ai n't no doctor , Lubliner . I am in the cloak-and-suit business , and I got to pay my creditors with United States money , Lubliner , if my wife would be dying yet . " " Which you ai n't got no wife , " Elkan added savagely . " Gott sei Dank ! " Sammet rejoined . " Aber if I did got one , y'understand , I would got Verstand enough to pick out a healthy woman , which Dishkes does everything the same . He picks out a store there on an avenue when it is a dead neighbourhood , understand me  --  and he wants us we should suffer for it . " " The neighbourhood would n't be dead after three months , " Elkan said . " Round the corner on both sides of the street is building thirty-three-foot , seven-story elevator apartments yet ; and when they are occupied , Dishkes would do a rushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sammet answered . " I ai n't speculating in real-estate futures , Lubliner ; so you might just so well go ahead and attend to your business , Lubliner , because me I am going to do the same . " " But lookyhere , Sammet , " Elkan still pleaded . " I seen pretty near every one of Dishkes ' creditors and they all agree the feller should have a three months ' extension . " " Let ' em agree , " Sammet shouted . " They are their own bosses and so am I , Lubliner ; so if they want to give him an extension of their account I ai n't got nothing to say . All I want is eight hundred dollars he owes me ; and the rest of them suckers could agree till they are black in the face . " " Aber , anyhow , Sammet , " Elkan said , " come to the meeting to-morrow morning and we would see what we could do . " " See what we could do ! " Sammet bellowed . " You will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will come to the meeting to-morrow and I 'll do it too . So , if you do n't mind , Lubliner , I could still do a little work before we close up here . " For a brief interval Elkan dug his nails into the palms of his hands , and his eyes unconsciously sought a target for a right swing on Sammet 's bloated face ; but at length he nodded and forced himself to smile . " Schon gut , Mr. Sammet , " he said ; " then I will see you to-morrow . " A moment later he strode down lower Fifth Avenue toward the place of business of the last creditor on Dishkes ' list . This was none other than Elkan 's distinguished friend , B. Gans , the manufacturer of high-grade dresses ; and it required less than ten minutes to procure his consent to the proposed extension . " And I hope , " Elkan said , " that we could count on you to be at the meeting to-morrow . " " That 's something I could n't do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a letter and give you full authority you should represent me there . Excuse me a minute and I 'll dictate it to Miss Scheindler . " When he returned , five minutes later , he sat down at his desk and , crossing his legs , prepared to beguile the tedium of waiting . " Well , Elkan , " he said , " what you been doing with yourself lately ? Thee-aytres and restaurants , I suppose ? " " Thee-aytres I ai n't so much interested in no more , " Elkan said . " The fact is , I am going in now for antics . " " Antics ! " B. Gans exclaimed . " Sure , " Elkan replied ; and there was a certain pride in his tones . " Antics is what I said , Mr. Gans  --  Jacobson chairs and them  --  now  --  cat 's furniture . " " Cat 's furniture ? " Gans repeated . " What d'ye mean cat 's furniture ? " " Angry cats , " Elkan explained ; and then a great light broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You mean Henri Quatre furniture ? " " Hungry cat oder angry cat , " Elkan said . " All I know is we are refurnishing our flat , Mr. Gans , and we are taking an advice from Max Merech , our designer . It 's a funny thing about that feller , Mr. Gans  --  with garments he is right up to the minute , aber mit furniture nothing suits him unless it would be anyhow a hundred years old . " " So you are buying some antique furniture for your flat ? " B. Gans commented , and Elkan nodded . " We made a start anyhow , " he said . " We bought a couple Jacobson chairs  --  two hundred and fifty years old already . " " Good ! " B. Gans exclaimed . " I want to tell you , Elkan , you could n't go far wrong if you would buy any piece of furniture over a hundred years old . They did n't know how to make things ugly in them days  --  and Jacobean chairs especially . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my library in Old French . It costs money , Elkan , but it 's worth it . " Elkan nodded and steered the conversation into safer channels ; so that by the time Miss Scheindler had brought in the letter they were discussing familiar business topics . " Also , " Gans said as he appended his neat signature to the letter , " I wish you and Dishkes luck , Elkan ; and keep up the good work about the antique furniture . Even when you would get stuck with a reproduction instead of a genuine piece once in a while , if it looks just as good as the original and no one tells you differently , understand me , you feel just as happy . " Thus encouraged , Elkan went home that evening full of a determination to acquire all the antique furniture his apartment would hold ; and he and Yetta sat up until past midnight conning the pages of a heavy volume on the subject , which Yetta had procured from the neighbouring public library . Accordingly Elkan rose late the following morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office and observed on the very top of his morning mail a slip of paper containing a message in the handwriting of Sam , the office boy . " A man called about Jacobowitz , " it read , and Elkan immediately rang his deskbell . " What Jacobowitz is this ? " he demanded as Sam entered , and the office boy shrugged . " I should know ! " he said . " What d'ye mean you should know ? " Elkan cried . " Ai n't I always told it you you should write down always the name when people call ? " " Ai n't Jacobowitz a name ? " Sam replied . " Furthermore , you could n't expect me I should get the family history from everybody which is coming in the place , Mr. Lubliner  --  especially when the feller says he would come back . " " Why did n't you tell me he is coming back ? " Elkan asked , and again Sam shrugged . " When the feller is coming back , Mr. Lubliner , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oder not . He would come back anyhow . " Having thus disposed of the matter to his entire satisfaction , Sam withdrew and banged the door triumphantly behind him , while Elkan fell to examining his mail . He had hardly cut the first envelope , however , when his door opened to admit Dishkes . " Nu , Dishkes ! " Elkan said . " You are pretty early , ai n't it ? " Dishkes nodded . " I 'm a Schlemiel , Mr. Lubliner , " he said , " and that 's all there is to it . Yesterday I went to work and lost my wife 's picture . " Elkan slapped his thigh with his hand . " Well , ai n't I a peach ? " he said . " I am getting so mixed up with these here antics I completely forgot to tell Yetta anything about it . I did n't even show it to her , Dishkes ; so you must leave me have it for a day longer , Dishkes . " As he spoke he drew the cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who gazed earnestly at it for a minute . Then , resting his elbows on his knees , he buried his face in his hands and burst into a fit of hysterical sobbing , whereat Elkan jumped from his seat and passed hurriedly out of the room . As he walked toward the showroom the strains of a popular song came from behind a rack . " Sam , " he bellowed , " who asks you you should whistle round here ? " The whistling ceased and Sam emerged from his hiding-place with a feather brush . " I could whistle without being asked , " Sam replied ; " and furthermore , Mr. Lubliner , when I am dusting the samples I must got to whistle ; otherwise the dust gets in my lungs , which I value my lungs the same like you do , Mr. Lubliner , even if I would be here only a boy working on stock ! " With this decisive rejoinder he resumed dusting the samples , while Elkan returned to his office , where he found that Dishkes had regained his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all of Dishkes ' creditors save one had signed an extension agreement , the meeting in Polatkin , Scheikowitz &amp; Company 's showroom was well attended ; and when Leon Sammet came in , at quarter-past eleven , the assemblage had already elected Charles Finkman , of Maisener &amp; Finkman , as chairman . He had just taken his seat in Philip Scheikowitz 's new revolving chair and was in the act of noisily clearing his throat in lieu of pounding the table with a gavel . " Gentlemen , " he said , " first , I want to thank you for the signal honour you are doing me in appointing me your chairman . For sixteen years now my labours in the Independent Order Mattai Aaron ai n't unknown to most of you here . Ten years ago , at the national convention held in Sarahcuse , gentlemen , I was unanimously elected by the delegates from sixty lodges to be your National Grand Master ; and  --   --  " At this juncture Leon Sammet rose ponderously to his feet . " Say , Finkman ! " retorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. O. M. A. got to do mit Dishkes here ? " Again Finkman cleared his throat , and this time he produced a note of challenge that caused the members of the I. O. M. A. there present to lean forward in their seats . They expected a crushing rejoinder and they were not disappointed . " What is the motto of the I. O. M. A. , Sammet ? " Finkman thundered . " ' Justice , Fraternity and Charity ! ' And I say to you now that , as chairman of this meeting , as well as Past National Grand Master of that noble order to which you and I both belong , verstehst du , I will see that justice be done , fraternity be encouraged and charity dispensed on each and every occasion . " Now , my brothers , here is a fellow member of our organization in distress , y'understand ; and I ask you one and all this question "  --  he raised his voice to a pitch that made the filaments tremble in the electric-light bulbs  --  " Who , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He paused dramatically just as Sam , the office boy , stuck his head in the showroom doorway and rent the silence with his high , piping voice . " Mr. Lubliner , " he said , " the man is here about Jacobowitz . " Elkan flapped his hand wildly , but it was too late to prevent the entrance of no less a person than Jacob Paul  --  the connoisseur of antiques and fine arts . " Hello , Finkman ! " he said ; " what 's the trouble here ? " Elkan started from his seat to interrupt his visitor , but there was something in Finkman 's manner that made him sit down again . " Why , how do you do , Mr. Paul ? " Finkman exclaimed ; and the clarion note had deserted his voice , leaving only a slight hoarseness to mark its passing . " What brings you here ? " " I might ask the same of you , Finkman , " Jacob Paul replied ; and as his keen eyes scanned the assembled company they rested for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspire . " The fact is , " Finkman began , " this here is a meeting of creditors of Louis Dishkes , of the Villy dee Paris Store on Amsterdam Avenue . " Paul turned to Louis Dishkes , proprietor of the Ville de Paris Store , who sat at the side of the room behind Scheikowitz 's desk in an improvised prisoner 's dock . " What 's the matter , Dishkes ? " Paul asked . " Could n't you make it go up there ? " Dishkes shrugged hopelessly . " Next month , when them houses round the corner is rented , " he said , " I could do a good business there . " " You ought to , " Paul agreed . " You ai n't got no competitors , so far as I could see . " " That 's what we all think ! " Elkan broke in  --  " that is to say , all of us except Mr. Sammet ; and he ai n't willing to wait for his money . " Leon Sammet moved uneasily in his chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ai n't you willing to wait , Sammet ? " he asked ; and Leon mopped his face with his handkerchief . " Well , it 's like this , Mr. Paul  --   --  " he began , but the connoisseur of antiques raised his hand . " One moment , Sammet , " he said . " You know as well as anybody else , and better even , that a millionaire concern like the Hamsuckett Mills must got to wait once in a while . " He paused significantly . " If we did n't , " he continued , " there 's plenty of solvent concerns would be forced to the wall  --  ai n't it ? Furthermore , if the Hamsuckett Mills did business the way you want to , Sammet , I would n't keep my job as credit man and treasurer very long . " Sammet nodded weakly and plied his handkerchief with more vigour , while Elkan sat and stared at his acquaintance of Sunday night in unfeigned astonishment . " Then what is the use of talking , Sammet ? " Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one standing out , why do n't you make an end of it ? How long an extension does Dishkes want ? " " Two months , " Finkman answered . " And where is the agreement you fellows all signed ? " Paul continued . Elkan took a paper from the desk in front of Dishkes and passed it to Paul , who drew from his waistcoat pocket an opulent gold-mounted fountain pen . Then he walked over to Leon Sammet and handed him the pen and the agreement . " Schreib , Sammet , " he said , " and do n't make no more fuss about it . " A moment later Sammet appended a shaky signature to the agreement and returned it , with the pen , to Paul . A quarter of an hour later Jacob Paul sat in Elkan 's office and smoked one of Polatkin , Scheikowitz &amp; Company 's best cigars . " Now I put it up to you , Lubliner , " he said : " them Jacobean chairs are pretty high at fifty dollars , but I want ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em . " Elkan smiled and made a wide gesture with both hands . " My dear Mr. Paul , " he said , " after what you done to-day for Dishkes I 'll make you a present of ' em  --  free for nothing . " " No , you wo n't do no such thing , " Paul declared ; " because I 'm going to sell ' em again and at a profit , as I may as well tell you . " " My worries what you are going to do with ' em ! " Elkan declared . " But one thing I ai n't going to do , Mr. Paul  --  I ai n't going to make no profit on you ; so go ahead and take the chairs at what I paid for ' em  --  and that 's the best I could do for you . " It required no further persuasion for Jacob Paul to draw a fifty-dollar check to Elkan 's order ; and as he rose to leave Elkan pressed his hand warmly . " Come up and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " I promise you you would see a flat furnished to your taste  --  no crayon portraits nor nothing . " * * * * * It was late in the afternoon when Elkan 's office door opened to admit Sam , the office boy . " Mr. Lubliner , " he said , " another feller is here about this here  --  now  --  Jacobowitz . " Elkan glanced through the half-open door and recognized the figure of Ringentaub , the antiquarian . " Tell him to come in , " he said ; and a moment later Ringentaub was wringing Elkan 's hand and babbling his gratitude for his brother-in-law 's deliverance from bankruptcy . " God will bless you for it , Mr. Lubliner , " he said ; " and I am ashamed of myself when I think of it . I am a dawg , Mr. Lubliner  --  and that 's all there is to it . " Here he drew a greasy wallet from his breast-pocket and extracted three ten-dollar bills . " Take ' em , Mr. Lubliner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He pressed the bills into Elkan 's hand . " What 's this ? " Elkan demanded . " That 's the change from your fifty dollars , " Ringentaub replied ; " because , so help me , Mr. Lubliner , there is first-class material in them chairs and the feller that makes ' em for me is a highgrade cabinetmaker . Then you got to reckon it stands me in a couple of dollars also to get ' em fixed up antique , y'understand ; so , if you get them chairs for twenty dollars you are buying a bargain , Mr. Lubliner . " " Why , what d'ye mean ? " Elkan cried . " Ai n't them chairs gen-wine Jacobean chairs ? " " Not by a whole lot they ai n't , " Ringentaub declared fervently . " But Mr. Paul thinks they are ! " Elkan exclaimed . " Sure , I know , " Ringentaub answered ; " and that shows what a lot a collector knows about such things . Paul is a credit man for the Hamsuckett Mills , Mr. Lubliner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For a moment Elkan gazed open-mouthed at the antiquarian and a great light began to break in on him . " So-o-o ! " he cried . " That 's what you mean by a collector ! " Ringentaub nodded . " And furthermore , Mr. Lubliner , when collectors knows more about antiques as dealers does , Mr. Lubliner , " he said with his hand on the doorknob , " I 'll go into the woollen piece-goods business too  --  which you could take it from me , Mr. Lubliner , it would n't be soon , by a hundred years even . " * * * * * When Elkan emerged from the **25;7359;TOOLONG Street station of the subway that evening a familiar voice hailed him from the rear . " Nu , Elkan ! " cried B. Gans , for it was none other than he . " You made out fine at the meeting this morning  --  ai n't it ? " " Who told you ? " Elkan asked as he linked arms with the highgrade manufacturer . " Never mind who told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could say is you made a tremendous hit with Jacob Paul , Elkan  --  and if that ai n't no compliment , understand me , I do n't know what is . Why , there ai n't a better judge of men oder antique furniture in this here city than Paul , Elkan . He 's an A-Number-One credit man , too , and I bet yer he gets a big salary from them Hamsuckett Mills people , which the least his income could be  --  considering what he picks up selling antiques  --  is fifteen thousand a year . " " Does Paul sell all the antiques he collects ? " Elkan asked . " Does he ? " B. Gans rejoined . " Well , I should say he does ! Myself I bought from him in the past two weeks half a dozen chairs , understand me  --  four last week and two to-day  --  which I am paying him five hundred dollars for the lot . They 're worth it , too , Elkan . I never seen finer examples of the period . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked as they reached the entrance to his apartment house . " Paul says they are , " B. Gans answered , slapping Elkan 's shoulder in farewell ; " and if he 's mistaken , Elkan , then I 'm content that I should be . " Two hours later , however , after Elkan had recounted to Yetta all the incidents of Dishkes ' meeting and the resulting sale of the chairs , his conscience smote him . " What d'ye think , Yetta ? " he asked . " Should I tell Paul and Gans the chairs ai n't gen-wine , oder not ? " For more than ten minutes Yetta wrinkled her forehead over this knotty ethical point ; then she delivered her opinion . " Mr. Gans tells you he is just as happy if they ai n't gen-wine  --  ai n't it ? " she said . Elkan nodded . " And Mr. Paul acted honest , because he did n't know they was n't gen-wine neither , ai n't it ? " she continued . Again Elkan nodded . " Then , " Yetta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as all that , Elkan , there 's only one thing for you to do  --  give me the thirty dollars ! " " Is that so ! " Elkan exclaimed ironically . " And what will you do with the money ? " " The only thing I can do with it , Schlemiel , " she said . " Ten dollars I will give Louis Dishkes he should take a trip up to the country over Sunday and visit his wife . " " And what will we do with the other twenty ? " Elkan asked . " We 'll send a present with him to Mrs. Dishkes , " Yetta concluded with a smile , " and it would n't be no antics neither ! " CHAPTER SEVEN SWEET AND SOUR ARE THE USES OF COMPETITIVE SALESMANSHIP " Aber me and Yetta is got it all fixed up we would go to Mrs. Kotlin 's already , " Elkan Lubliner protested as he mopped his forehead one hot Tuesday morning in July . " The board there is something elegant , Mr. Scheikowitz . Everybody says so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retorted . " Who is everybody , Elkan ? A couple drummers like Marks Pasinsky , one or two real estaters , understand me , and the rest of ' em is wives from J to L retailers , third credit , which every time their husbands comes down to spend Sunday with ' em , y'understand , he must pretty near got to pawn the shirt from his back for car fare already . " " Scheikowitz is right , Elkan , " Marcus Polatkin joined in . " A feller should n't make a god from his stomach , Elkan , especially when money do n't figure at all , so if you would be going down to Egremont Beach , understand me , there 's only one place you should stay , y'understand , and that 's the New Salisbury . " " Which if you would n't take our word for it , Elkan , " Scheikowitz added , " just give a look here . " He drew from his coat pocket the summer resort section of the previous day 's paper and thrust it toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half column headed : MIDSEASON GAIETY AT EGREMONT BEACH which reads as follows : The season is in full swing here . On Saturday night Mr. and Mrs. Bernard Gans gave a Chinese Lantern Dinner in the Hanging Gardens at which were present Mr. and Mrs. Sam Feder , Mr. and Mrs. Max Koblin , Mr. and Mrs. Henry D. Feldman , Mr. Jacob Scharley and Miss Hortense Feldman . Among those who registered Friday at the New Salisbury were Mr. Jacob Scharley of San Francisco , Mr. and Mrs. Sol Klinger , Mr. Leon Sammet and his mother , Mrs. Leah Sammet . " I thought that Leon 's brother Barney was staying down at Egremont , " Polatkin said after he and Elkan had read the item . " Barney is at Mrs. Kotlin 's , " Scheikowitz explained , " because mit Leon Sammet , Polatkin , nothing is too rotten for Barney to stay at , and besides he thinks Barney would get a little small business there , which the way Sammet Brothers figures , understand me , if they could stick a feller with three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ y'understand , so long as he pays up on the first two , he could n't eat up their profits if he would bust up on ' em mit the third . " " Sure I know , " Elkan said , " aber I ai n't going down to Egremont for business , Mr. Scheikowitz , I 'm going because it ai n't so warm down there . " " Schmooes , Elkan ! " Scheikowitz retorted . " It would n't make it not one degrees warmer in Egremont supposing you could get a couple new accounts down there . " " B. Gans do n't take it so particular about the weather , " Polatkin commented . " I bet yer he would a whole lot sooner take off his coat and shirt and spiel a little auction pinocle mit Sol Klinger and Leon Sammet and all them fellers as be giving dinners already in a tuxedo suit to Sam Feder . I bet yer he gets a fine accommodation from the Kosciusko Bank out of that dinner yet . " " The other people also he ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Scheikowitz declared . " Every one of ' em means something to B. Gans , I bet yer . " Elkan nodded . " Particularly Scharley , " he said . " What d'ye mean , particularly Scharley ? " Polatkin and Scheikowitz inquired with one voice . " Why , ai n't you heard about Scharley ? " Elkan asked . " It 's right there in the Daily Cloak and Suit Journal . " He indicated the front sheet of that newsy trade paper , where under the heading of " Incorporations " appeared the following item : The Scharley , Oderburg Drygoods Company , San Francisco , Cal. , has filed articles of incorporation , giving its capital stock as $500,000 , and expects to open its new store in September next . " And you are talking about staying by Mrs. Kotlin 's ! " Scheikowitz exclaimed in injured tones . " You should ought to be ashamed of yourself , Elkan . " Elkan received his senior partner 's upbraiding with a patient smile . " What show do we stand against a concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gans sells him only highgrade goods , Elkan , " Scheikowitz declared . " I bet yer the least the feller buys is for twenty thousand dollars garments here , and a good half would be popular price lines , which if we would get busy , we stand an elegant show there , Elkan . " " You should ought to go down there to-morrow yet , " Polatkin cried , " because the first thing you know Leon Sammet would entertain him mit oitermobiles yet , and Sol Klinger gets also busy , understand me , and the consequences is we would n't be in it at all . " " Next Saturday is the earliest Yetta could get ready , " Elkan replied positively , and Polatkin strode up and down the floor in an access of despair . " All right , Elkan , " he said , " if you want to let such an opportunity slip down your fingers , y'understand , all right . Aber if I would be you , Elkan , I would go down there to-night yet . " Elkan shrugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should close up the flat under the very least two days , Mr. Polatkin , " he said . " She must got to fix everything just right , mit moth-camphor and Gott weisst was nach , otherwise she would n't go at all . The rugs alone takes a whole day to fix . " " Do as you like , Elkan , " Polatkin declared , " aber you mark my words , if Leon Sammet ai n't shoving heaven and earth right now , y'understand , I do n't know nothing about the garment business at all . " In fulfilment of this prophecy , when Elkan entered his office the following morning Polatkin waved in his face a copy of the morning paper . " Well , " he said , " what did I told you , Elkan ? " Scheikowitz nodded slowly . " My partner is right , Elkan , " he added , " so stubborn you are . " " What 's the matter now ? " Elkan asked , and for answer Polatkin handed him the paper with his thumb pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feder , Mr. and Mrs. Max Koblin , Mr. and Mrs. Henry D. Feldman , Miss Hortense Feldman , and Mr. Jacob Scharley were guests of Mr. Leon Sammet at a Chinese Lantern Dinner this evening given in the Hanging Gardens of the New Salisbury . " I thought it would be at the least an oitermobile ride , " Polatkin said in melancholy tones , " but with that sucker all he could do is stealing a competitor 's idees . B. Gans gives Scharley a dinner and Leon Sammet is got to do it , too , mit the same guests and everything . " " Even to Feldman 's sister already , " Scheikowitz added , " which it must be that Feldman is trying to marry her off to Scharley even if he would be a widower mit two sons in college . She 's a highly educated young lady , too . " " Young she ai n't no longer , " Polatkin interrupted , " and if a girl could n't cook even a pertater , understand me , it do n't make no difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ y'understand , Feldman would got a hard job marrying her off anyhow . " Scheikowitz made an impatient gesture with both hands , suggestive of a dog swimming . " That 's neither here or there , Polatkin , " he said . " The point is Elkan should go right uptown and geschwind pack his grip and be down at the Salisbury this afternoon yet , if Yetta would be ready oder not . We could n't afford to let the ground grow under our feet and that 's all there is to it . " Thus , shortly after six o'clock that evening , Elkan and Yetta alighted from the 5:10 special from Flatbush Avenue and picked their way through a marital throng that kissed and embraced with as much ardour as though the reunion had concluded a parting of ten years instead of ten hours . At length the happy couples dragged themselves apart and crowded into the automobile ' bus of the New Salisbury , sweeping Elkan and Yetta before them , so that when the ' bus arrived at the hotel Elkan and Yetta were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baggage with the contemptuous manner that Ham nowadays evinces toward Shem , and Elkan and Yetta followed him through the luxurious social hall to the desk . There the room clerk immediately shot out a three-carat diamond ring , and when Elkan 's eyes became accustomed to the glare he saw that beneath it was a fat white hand extended in cordial greeting . " Why , how do you do , Mr. Williams , " Elkan cried , as he shook hands fervently . " Ai n't you in the Pitt House , Sarahcuse , no more ? " " I 'm taking a short vacation in a sensible manner , Mr. Lubliner , " Mr. Williams replied in the rounded tones that only truly great actors , clergymen , and room clerks possess . " Which means that I am interested in a real-estate development near here , and I 'm combining business with pleasure for a couple of months . " Elkan nodded admiringly . " You got the right idee , Mr. Williams , " he said . " This is my wife , Mr. Williams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that combined the grace of Paderewski and the dignity of Prince Florizel in just the right proportions . " Delighted to know you , Madame , " he declared . " Have you made reservations , Mr. Lubliner ? " Elkan shook his head and after an exchange of confidential murmurs Mr. Williams assigned them a room with an ocean view , from which they emerged less than half an hour later to await on the veranda the welcome sound of the dinner gong . A buzz of animated conversation filled the air , above which rose a little shriek of welcome as Mrs. Gans rushed toward Yetta with outstretched hands . " Why , hello , Yetta ! " she cried . " I did n't know you was coming down here . " They exchanged the kiss of utter peace that persists between the kin of highgrade and popular-priced manufacturers . " I read about you in the newspapers , " Yetta said , as they seated themselves in adjoining rockers , and Mrs. Gans flashed all the gems of her right hand in a gesture of deprecation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it makes me sick here the way people carries on . Honestly , Yetta , I do n't see Barney only at meals and when he 's getting dressed . Everything is Mister Scharley , Mister Scharley . You would think he was H. P. Morgan oder the Czar of Russland from the fuss everybody makes over him . " Yetta nodded in sympathy and suddenly Mrs. Gans clutched the arm of her chair . " There he is now , " she hissed . " Where ? " Yetta asked , and Mrs. Gans nodded toward a doorway at the end of the veranda , on which in electric bulbs was outlined the legend , " Hanging Gardens . " Yetta descried a short , stout personage between fifty and sixty years of age , arrayed in a white flannel suit of which the coat and waistcoat were cut in imitation of an informal evening costume . On his arm there drooped a lady no longer in her twenties , and from the V-shaped opening in the rear of her dinner gown a medical student could have distinguished with more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right and left scapula and the articulation of each with the humerus and clavicle . " That 's Miss Feldman , " Mrs. Gans whispered . " She 's refined like anything , Yetta , and she talks French better as a waiter already . " At this juncture the dinner gong sounded and Yetta rejoined Elkan in the social hall . " What is the trouble you are looking so rachmonos , Elkan ? " she asked as she pressed his arm consolingly . " To-night it 's Sol Klinger , " Elkan replied . " He 's got a dinner on in the Hanging Gardens for Scharley , Yetta , and I guess I would n't get a look-in even . " " You 've got six weeks before you , " Yetta assured him , " and you should n't worry . Something is bound to turn up , ai n't it ? " She gave his arm another little caress and they proceeded immediately to the dining room , where the string orchestra and the small talk of two hundred and fifty guests strove vainly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight o'clock before Elkan and Yetta arose from the table and repaired to the veranda whose rockers were filled with a chattering throng . " Let 's get out of this , " Elkan said , and they descended the veranda steps to the sidewalk . Five minutes later they were seated on a remote bench of the boardwalk , and until nine o'clock they watched the beauty of the moon and sea , which is constant even at Egremont Beach . When they rose to go Yetta noticed for the first time a shawl-clad figure on the adjacent bench , and immediately a pair of keen eyes flashed from a face whose plump contentment was framed in a jet black wig of an early Victorian design . * * * * * " Why , if it ai n't Mrs. Lesengeld , " Yetta exclaimed and the next moment she enfolded the little woman in a cordial embrace . " You grown a bisschen fat , Yetta , " Mrs. Lesengeld said . " I would n't knew you at all , if you ai n't speaking to me first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Mr. Lubliner , " Yetta went on . " He heard me talk often from you , Mrs. Lesengeld , and what a time you got it learning me I should speak English yet . " Elkan beamed at Mrs. Lesengeld . " And not only that , " he said , " but also how good to her you was when she was sick already . There ai n't many boarding-house ladies like you , Mrs. Lesengeld . " " And there ai n't so many boarders like Yetta , neither , " Mrs. Lesengeld retorted . " And do you got a boarding-house down here , Mrs. Lesengeld ? " Yetta asked . " I 've gone out of the boarding-house business , " Mrs. Lesengeld replied , " which you know what a trouble I got it mit that lowlife Lesengeld , olav hasholom , after he failed in the pants business , how I am working my fingers to the bones already keeping up his insurings in the I. O. M. A. and a couple thousand dollars in a company already . " Yetta nodded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Lesengeld concluded . " Quick diabetes , Yetta , and so I bought for ten thousand dollars a mortgage , understand me , and my son-in-law allows me also four dollars a week which I got it a whole lot easier nowadays . " " And are you staying down here ? " Elkan asked . " Me , I got for twenty dollars a month a little house mit two rooms only , right on the sea , which they call it there Bognor Park . You must come over and see us , Yetta . Such a gemuetlich little house we got it you would n't believe at all , and every Sunday my daughter Fannie and my son-in-law comes down and stays with us . " " And are you going all the way home alone ? " Elkan asked anxiously . " Fannie is staying down with me to-night . She meets me on the corner of the Boulevard , where the car stops , at ten o'clock already , " Mrs. Lesengeld replied . " Then you must got to come right along with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would get there on time . " " Where are you going ? " Mrs. Lesengeld asked . " Over to the Salisbury , " Elkan answered , and Mrs. Lesengeld sank back on to the bench . " Geh weg , Mr. Lubliner , " she cried . " I am now fifty years old and I was never in such a place in my life , especially which under this shawl I got only a plain cotton dress yet . " Elkan flapped his hand reassuringly . " A fine-looking lady like you , Mrs. Lesengeld , " he said , as he seized her hands and drew her gently to her feet , " looks well in anything . " " And you 'll have a water ice in the Hanging Gardens with us , " Yetta persisted as she slipped a hand under Mrs. Lesengeld 's shawl and pressed her arm affectionately . Ten minutes later they arrived at the stoop of the New Salisbury , to the scandalization and horror of the three score A to F first credit manufacturers and their wives . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diamonds rose and fell indignantly on the bosoms of twenty or thirty credit-high retailers ' wives , when the little , toilworn woman with her shawl and ritualistic wig entered the Hanging Gardens chatting pleasantly with Elkan and Yetta ; and as they seated themselves at a table the buzz of conversation hushed into silence and then roared out anew with an accompaniment of titters . At the next table Sol Klinger plied with liquors and cigars the surviving guests of his dinner , and when Elkan nodded to him , he ignored the salutation with a blank stare . He raged inwardly , not so much at Elkan 's invasion of that fashionable precinct as at the circumstance that his guest of honour had departed with Miss Feldman for a stroll on the boardwalk some ten minutes previously , and he was therefore unable to profit by Elkan 's faux pas . " The feller ai n't got no manners at all , " he said to Max Koblin , who nodded gloomily . " It 's getting terrible mixed down here , Sol , " Max commented as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be in striking distance of your business , Sol , so 's you could come in and out every day , you got to rub shoulders with everybody , ai n't it ? " He soothed his outraged sensibilities with a great cloud of smoke that drifted over Elkan 's table , and Mrs. Lesengeld broke into a fit of coughing which caused a repetition of the titters . " And do you still make that brown stewed fish sweet and sour , Mrs. Lesengeld ? " Yetta asked by way of putting the old lady at her ease . " Make it ! " Mrs. Lesengeld answered . " I should say I do . Why you would n't believe the way my son-in-law is crazy about it . We got it every Sunday regular , and I tell you what I would do , Yetta . " She laid her hand on Yetta 's arm and her face broke into a thousand tiny wrinkles of hospitality . " You should come Friday to lunch sure , " she declared , " and we would got some brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bortch to begin with . " Sol Klinger had been leaning back in his chair in an effort to overhear their conversation , and at this announcement he broke into a broad guffaw , which ran around the table after he had related the cause of it to his guests . Indeed , so much did Sol relish the joke that with it he entertained the occupants of about a dozen seats in the smoking car of the 8:04 express the next morning , and he was so full of it when he entered Hammersmith 's Restaurant the following noon that he could not forego the pleasure of visiting Marcus Polatkin 's table and relating it to Polatkin himself . Polatkin heard him through without a smile and when at its conclusion Klinger broke into a hysterical appreciation of his own humour , Polatkin shrugged . " I suppose , Klinger , " he said , " your poor mother , olav hasholom , did n't wear a sheitel neither , ai n't it ? " " My mother , olav hasholom , would got more sense as to butt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Even if you would n't of been ashamed to have taken her there , Klinger , " he added . Klinger flushed angrily . " That ai n't here or there , Polatkin , " he said . " You should ought to put your partner wise , Polatkin , that he should n't go dragging in an old Bube into a place like the Salisbury and talking such nonsense like brown stewed fish sweet and sour . " He broke into another laugh at the recollection of it  --  a laugh that was louder but hardly as unforced as the first one . " What 's the matter mit brown stewed fish sweet and sour , Klinger ? " Polatkin asked . " I eat already a lot of a-la 's and en cazzerolls in a whole lot of places just so grossartig as the Salisbury , understand me , and I would schenck you a million of ' em for one plate of brown stewed fish sweet and sour like your mother made it from zu Hause yet . " " But what for an interest does a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Klinger protested lamely . " Honestly , I was ashamed for your partner 's sake to hear such a talk going on there . " " Did Scharley got any objections ? " Polatkin asked . " Fortunately the feller had gone away from the table , " Klinger replied , " so he did n't hear it at all . " " Well , " Polatkin declared , taking up his knife and fork as a signal that the matter was closed , " ask him and see if he would n't a whole lot sooner eat some good brown stewed fish sweet and sour as a Chinese Lantern Dinner  --  whatever for a bunch of poison that might be , Klinger  --  and do n't you forget it . " Nevertheless when Polatkin returned to his place of business he proceeded at once to Elkan 's office . " Say , lookyhere Elkan , " he demanded , " what is all this I hear about you and Yetta taking an old Bube into the Hanging Gardens already , and making from her laughing stocks out of the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a free country , Mr. Polatkin , " he said , " and so long as I pay my board mit U. S. money , already I would take in there any of my friends I would please . " " Sure , I know , " Polatkin expostulated , " but I seen Klinger around at Hammersmith 's and he says  --   --  " " Klinger ! " Elkan exclaimed . " Well , you could say to Klinger for me , Mr. Polatkin , that if he do n't like the way I am acting around there , understand me , he should just got the nerve to tell it me to my face yet . " Polatkin flapped the air with his right hand . " Never mind Klinger , Elkan , " he said . " You got to consider you should n't make a fool of yourself before Scharley and all them people . How do you expect you should get such a merchant as Scharley he should accept from you entertainment like a Chinese Lantern Dinner , if you are acting that way ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retorted . " When we got the right goods at the right price , Mr. Polatkin , why should we got to give a merchant dinners yet to convince him of it ? " " Dinners is nothing , Elkan , " Polatkin interrupted with a wave of his hand . " You got to give him dyspepsha even , the way business is nowadays . " " Aber I was talking to the room clerk last night , " Elkan went on , " and he tells me so sure as you are standing there , Mr. Polatkin , a Chinese Lantern Dinner would stand us in twenty dollars a head . " " Twenty dollars a head ! " Polatkin exclaimed and indulged himself in a low whistle . " So even if I would be staying at the Salisbury , understand me , " Elkan said , " I ai n't going to throw away our money out of the window exactly . " " Aber how are you going to get the feller down here , if you would n't entertain him or something ? " Elkan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Leave that to me , Mr. Polatkin , " he said , and put on his hat preparatory to going out to lunch . Nevertheless when he descended from his room at the New Salisbury that evening and prepared to take a turn on the boardwalk before dinner , his confidence evaporated at the coolness of his reception by the assembled guests of the hotel . Leon Sammet cut him dead , and even B. Gans greeted him with half jovial reproach . " Well , Elkan , " he said , " going to entertain any more fromme Leute in the Garden to-night ? " " Seemingly , Mr. Gans , " Elkan said , " it was a big shock to everybody here to see for the first time an old lady wearing a sheitel . I suppose nobody here never seen it before , ai n't it ? " B. Gans put a fatherly hand on Elkan 's shoulder . " I 'll tell yer , Elkan , " he said , " if I would be such a rosher , understand me , that I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old friend , like this here lady must be , y'understand , I should never sell a dollar 's worth more goods so long as I live , aber if Klinger and Sammet would start kidding you in front of Scharley , understand me , it would look bad . " " Why would it look bad , Mr. Gans ? " Elkan broke in . " Because it do n't do nobody no good to have funny stories told about ' em , except an actor oder a politician , Elkan , " Gans replied as the dinner gong began to sound , " which if a customer would n't take you seriously , he would n't take your goods seriously neither , Elkan , and that 's all there is to it . " He smiled reassuringly as he walked toward the dining room and left Elkan a prey to most uncomfortable reflections , which did not abate when he overheard Klinger and Sammet hail Gans at the end of the veranda . " Well , Mr. Gans , " Klinger said with a sidelong glance at Elkan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stewed fish sweet und sour ? " Elkan could not distinguish B. Gans ' reply , but he scowled fiercely at the trio as they entered the hotel lobby , and he still frowned as he sauntered stolidly after them to await Yetta in the social hall . " What 's the matter , Mr. Lubliner , " the room clerk asked when Elkan passed the desk . " Are n't you feeling well to-day ? " " I feel all right , Mr. Williams , " Elkan replied , " but this here place is getting on my nerves . It 's too much like a big hotel out on the road somewheres . Everybody looks like they would got something to sell , understand me , and was doing their level best to sell it . " " You 're quite right , Mr. Lubliner , " the clerk commented , " and that 's the reason why I came down here . In fact , " he added with a guilty smile , " I made a date to show some of my lots to-morrow to a prospective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a basket of champagne and followed by two waiters with ice buckets , and the room clerk jerked his head sideways in the direction toward which the little procession had disappeared . " That 's for Suite 27 , the Feldmans ' rooms , " he explained . " Miss Feldman is giving a little chafing-dish dinner there to Mr. Scharley and a few friends . " He accepted with a graceful nod Elkan 's proffered cigar . " Which goes to show that it 's as you say , Mr. Lubliner , " he concluded . " If you have drygoods , real estate or marriageable relatives to dispose of , Mr. Lubliner , Egremont 's the place to market them . " * * * * * " Yes , Mr. Williams , " said Jacob Scharley at two o'clock the following afternoon as they trudged along the sands of Bognor Park , one of Egremont Beach 's new developments , " I was trying to figure out how these here Chinese Lantern Dinners stands in a sucker like Leon Sammet twenty dollars a head , when by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fifty cents including drinks . " " You ca n't figure on a special dinner according to the prices on the regular bill of fare , " said Mr. Williams , the room clerk , who in his quality of real-estate operator was attempting to shift the conversation from hotel matters to the topic of seaside lots . " Why , ice cream is twenty-five cents on the bill of fare , but at one of those dinners it 's served in imitation Chinese lanterns , which makes it worth double at least . " " For my part , " Scharley broke in , " they could serve it in kerosene lamps , Mr. Williams , because I never touch the stuff . " " It 's a parallel case to lots here and lots on Mizzentop Beach , which is the next beach below , " Williams continued . " Here we have a boardwalk extending right down to our property , and we are getting seven hundred and fifty dollars a lot , while there , with practically the same transit facilities but no boardwalk or electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Aber you take a piece of tenderloin steak a half an inch thick and about the size of a price ticket , understand me , " Scharley interrupted , " and even if you would fix it up with half a cent 's worth of peas and spill on it a bottle cough medicine and glue , verstehst du mich , how could you make it figure up more as a dollar and a quarter , Mr. Williams ? Then the clams , Mr. Williams , must got to have inside of ' em at the very least a half a karat pink pearl in ' em , otherwise thirty-five cents would be big yet . " " Very likely , " Mr. Williams agreed as a shade of annoyance passed over his well modelled features , " but just now , Mr. Scharley , I 'm anxious to show you the advantage of these lots of ours , and you wo n't mind if I do n't pursue the topic of Chinese Lantern Dinners any farther . " " I 'm only too glad not to talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact if any one else tries to ring in another one of them dinners on me , Mr. Williams , I 'll turn him down on the spot . Shaving-dish parties neither , which I assure you , Mr. Williams , even if Miss Feldman would be an elegant , refined young lady , understand me , she fixes something in that shaving dish of hers last night , understand me , which I thought I was poisoned already . " Williams deemed it best to ignore this observation and therefore made no comment . " But anyhow , " Scharley concluded as they approached a little wooden shack on the margin of the water , " I 'm sick and tired of things to eat , so let 's talk about something else . " Having delivered this ultimatum , his footsteps lagged and he stopped short as he began to sniff the air like a hunting dog . " M-m-m-m ! " he exclaimed . " What is that ? " " That 's a two-room shed we rent for twenty dollars a month , " Williams explained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay our office rent over in New York . " " Sure I know , " Scharley agreed , " aber , m-m-m-m ! " Once more he expanded his nostrils to catch a delicious fragrance that emanated from the little shack . " Aber , who lives there ? " he insisted , and Mr. Williams could not restrain a laugh . " Why , it 's that old lady with the wig that Lubliner brought over to the hotel the other night , " he replied . " I thought I saw Sol Klinger telling you about it yesterday . " " He started to tell me something about it , " Scharley said , " when Barney Gans butted in and would n't let him . What was it about this here old lady ? " " There is n't anything to it particularly , " Williams replied , " excepting that it seemed a little strange to see an old lady in a shawl and one of those religious wigs in the Hanging Gardens , and there was something else Klinger told me about Mrs. Lubliner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and  --   --  " At this juncture Scharley snapped his fingers excitedly . " Brown stewed fish sweet and sour ! " he almost shouted . " I ai n't smelled it since I was a boy already . " He wagged his head and again murmured , " M-m-m-m-m ! " Suddenly he received an inspiration . " How much did you say them shanties rents for , Mr. Williams ? " he said . " Twenty dollars a month , " Williams replied . " You do n't tell me ! " Scharley exclaimed solemnly . " I wonder if I could give a look at the inside of one of ' em  --  this one here , for instance . " " I do n't think there 'd be any objection , " Williams said , and no sooner were the words out of his mouth than Scharley started off on a half trot for the miniature veranda on the ocean side of the little house . " Perhaps I 'd better inquire first if it 's convenient for them to let us in now , " Williams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocked gently on the doorjamb . There was a sound of scurrying feet within , and at length the door was opened a few inches and the bewigged head of Mrs. Lesengeld appeared in the crack . " Nu , " she said , " what is it ? " " I represent the Bognor Park Company , " Williams replied , " and if it 's perfectly convenient for you , Mrs.  --   --  " " Lesengeld , " she added . " Used to was Lesengeld &amp; Schein in the pants business ? " Scharley asked , and Mrs. Lesengeld nodded . " Why , Lesengeld and me was lodge brothers together in the I. O. M. A. before I went out to the Pacific Coast years ago already , " Scharley declared . " I guess he 's often spoken to you about Jake Scharley , ai n't it ? " " Maybe he did , Mr. Scharley , aber he 's dead schon two years since already , " Mrs. Lesengeld said , and then added the pious hope , " olav hasholom . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accents . " Why , he was n't no older as me already . " " Fifty-three when he died , " Mrs. Lesengeld said . " Quick diabetes , Mr. Scharley . Would n't you step inside ? " Scharley and Williams passed into the front room , which was used as a living room and presented an appearance of remarkable neatness and order . In the corner stood an oil stove on which two saucepans bubbled and steamed , and as Mrs. Lesengeld turned to follow her visitors one of the saucepans boiled over . " Oo-ee ! " she exclaimed . " Mein fisch . " " Go ahead and tend to it , " Scharley cried excitedly ; " do n't mind us . It might get burned already . " He watched her anxiously while she turned down the flame . " Brown stewed fish sweet and sour , ai n't it ? " he asked , and Mrs. Lesengeld nodded as she lowered the flame to just the proper height . " I thought it was , " Scharley continued . " I ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , olav hasholom , used to fix it something elegant . " He heaved a sigh as he sat down on a nearby campstool . " This smells just like it , " he added . In front of the window a table had been placed , spread with a spotless white cloth and laid for two persons , and Scharley glanced at it hastily and turned his head away . " Forty years ago come next Shevuos I ai n't tasted it already , " he concluded . Mrs. Lesengeld coloured slightly and clutched at her apron in an agony of embarrassment . " The fact is we only got three knives and forks , " she said , " otherwise there is plenty fish for everybody . " " Why , we just had our lunch at the hotel before we started , " Mr. Williams said . " You did , " Scharley corrected him reproachfully , " aber I ai n't hardly touched a thing since last night . That shaving-dish party pretty near killed me , already . " " Well , then , we got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you like maybe also Bortch , Mr. Scharley ? " " Bortch ! " Mr. Scharley exclaimed , and his voice trembled with excitement . " Do you mean a sort of soup mit beets and  --  and  --  all that ? " " That 's it , " Mrs. Lesengeld replied , and Scharley nodded his head slowly . " Mrs. Lesengeld , " he said , " would you believe me , it 's so long since I tasted that stuff I did n't remember such a thing exists even . " " And do you like it ? " Mrs. Lesengeld repeated . " Do I like it ! " Scharley cried . " Um Gottes Willen , Mrs. Lesengeld , I love it . " " Then sit right down , " she said heartily . " Everything is ready . " " If you do n't mind , Mr. Scharley , " Williams interrupted , " I 'll wait for you at the office of the company . It 's only a couple of hundred yards down the beach . " " Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scharley said as he tucked a napkin between his collar and chin . " I 'll be there when I get through . " After Mrs. Lesengeld had ushered out Mr. Williams , she proceeded to the door of the rear room and knocked vigorously . " Do n't be foolish , Yetta , and come on out , " she called . " It ai n't nobody but an old friend of my husband 's . " A moment later Yetta entered the room , and Scharley scrambled to his feet , a knife grasped firmly in one hand , and bobbed his head cordially . " Pleased to meetcher , " he said . " This is Mrs. Lubliner , Mr. Scharley , " Mrs. Lesengeld said . " Do n't make no difference , Mrs. Lesengeld , " Scharley assured her , " any friend of yours is a friend of mine , so you should sit right down , Mrs. Lubliner , on account we are all ready to begin . " Then followed a moment of breathless silence while Mrs. Lesengeld dished up the beetroot soup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Scharley he immediately plunged his spoon into it . A moment later he lifted his eyes to the ceiling . " Oo-ee ! " he exclaimed . " What an elegant soup ! " Mrs. Lesengeld blushed , and after the fashion of a cordon bleu the world over , she began to decry her own handiwork . " It should ought to got just a Bisschen more pepper into it , " she murmured . " Oser a Stueck , " Scharley declared solemnly , as he consumed the contents of his bowl in great gurgling inhalations . " There 's only one thing I got to say against it . " He scraped his bowl clean and handed it to Mrs. Lesengeld . " And that is , " he concluded , " that it makes me eat so much of it , understand me , I 'm scared I would n't got no room for the brown stewed fish . " Again he emptied the bowl , and at last the moment arrived when the brown stewed fish smoked upon the table . Mrs. Lesengeld helped Scharley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched him intently , as with the deftness of a Japanese juggler he balanced approximately a half pound of the succulent fish on the end of his fork . For nearly a minute he blew on it , and when it reached an edible temperature he opened wide his mouth and thrust the fork load home . Slowly and with great smacking of his moist lips he chewed away , and then his eyes closed and he laid down his knife and fork . " Gan-eden ! " he declared as he reached across the table and shook hands with Mrs. Lesengeld . " Mrs. Lesengeld , " he said , " my mother olav hasholom was a good cook , understand me , aber you are a good cook , Mrs. Lesengeld , and that 's all there is to it . " Forthwith he resumed his knife and fork , and with only two pauses for the necessary replenishments , he polished off three platefuls of the fish , after which he heaved a great sigh of contentment , and as a prelude to conversation he lit one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dessert coming , " Mrs. Lesengeld said . " Dessert after this , Mrs. Lesengeld , " he replied , through clouds of contented smoke , " would be a sacrilege , ai n't it ? " " That 's something I could n't make at all , " Mrs. Lesengeld admitted . " All I got it here is some frimsel kugel . " " Frimsel kugel ! " Scharley exclaimed , laying down his cigar . " Why ai n't you told me that before ? " A quarter of an hour later he again lighted his cigar , and this time he settled back in his campstool for conversation , while Mrs. Lesengeld busied herself about the oil stove . Instantly , however , he straightened up as another and more delicious odour assailed his nostrils , for Mrs. Lesengeld made coffee by a mysterious process , that conserved in the flavour of the decoction the delicious fragrance of the freshly ground bean . " And are you staying down here with Mrs. Lesengeld ? " Scharley asked Yetta after he had finished his third cup . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indignantly . " Well , I should say not . She 's stopping at the Salisbury , ai n't you , Yetta ? " Yetta nodded and sighed . " It ai n't so comfortable as here , " she said . " I bet yer , " Scharley added fervently . " I am stopping there too , and them Chinese Lantern Dinners which they are putting up ! " He waved his hand eloquently . " Poison ai n't no word for it , Missus Er  --   --  " he concluded lamely as he tried to remember Yetta 's name , which after so much soup , fish and coffee had completely escaped him . " Lubliner , " Yetta said . " I guess you know my husband , Mr. Scharley , Elkan Lubliner of Polatkin , Scheikowitz &amp; Company . " Scharley struck the table with his open hand . " Zoitenly , I do , " he cried . " Why , he is the feller which Sol Klinger is telling me about . " Yetta coloured slightly and bit her lips . " What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why , " Scharley said , drawing vigorously on his imagination , " he says to me what a bright young feller he is and  --   --  " Here he reflected that in a highly competitive trade like the cloak and suit business this statement sounded a trifle exaggerated . " And , " he went on hurriedly , " he told me how he saw you and him with Mrs. Lesengeld up at the hotel the other evening , and I says , ' What , ' I says , ' you do n't mean Mrs. Lesengeld whose husband used to was in the pants business ? ' and he said he did n't know , ' because , ' I says , ' if that 's the same party , ' I says , ' I would like for her to come up to the hotel and take dinner with me some time , ' I says . " He smiled cordially at Mrs. Lesengeld . " And I hope you will , " he concluded earnestly , " to-morrow night sure . " Mrs. Lesengeld shook her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no swell hotel , " she demurred . " I ai n't got no clothes nor nothing . " " What do you care about clothes , Mrs. Lesengeld ? " Scharley protested . " And besides , " Yetta said with sudden inspiration , " we could get up a little chafing-dish dinner in our room , ai n't it ? " " For that matter we could do it in my room , " Scharley cried , as there sounded a vigorous knocking on the outside of the door leading to the veranda , and a moment later Williams entered . " Excuse me , Mr. Scharley , " he said , " but I have to be getting back to the hotel and if you 're quite through we 'll go and look at that map of the lots down in the office . " Scharley waved his hand airily . " Sit down , Mr. Williams , " he said , " and drink the cup of coffee of your life . " He handed the room clerk a cigar . " I could promise you one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I got a great idee of buying some lots here and building a little house on ' em , gemuetlich just like this , and if I do , Williams , I would take them lots from you for certain sure . Only one thing , Williams , I want you to do me for a favour . " He paused and puffed carefully on his cigar . " I want you to pick me out a couple good vacant rooms on the top floor of the Salisbury for Saturday night , " he said , " where I could give a shaving-dish party , so if any of the guests of the hotel objects , understand me , they would n't get the smell of the Bortch , coffee , and brown stewed fish sweet and sour . " * * * * * On the following Wednesday afternoon Elkan sat at his desk , while Marcus Polatkin and Philip Scheikowitz leaned over his left shoulder and right shoulder respectively , and watched carefully the result of a pencilled addition which Elkan was making . " With them crepe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's order comes to four thousand three hundred dollars . " Polatkin and Scheikowitz nodded in unison . " It ai n't bad for a start , " Scheikowitz volunteered as he sat down and lit a cigar . " For a finish , neither , " Polatkin added , " so far as that 's concerned . " Elkan wheeled round in his chair and grinned delightedly . " And you ought to seen Sol Klinger when we walked into the Hanging Gardens , " he said . " He got white like a sheet . It tickled Scharley to death , and he went right to work and put his arm through Mrs. Lesengeld 's arm and took her right down to the middle table , like she would be a queen already . " " Sure , " Scheikowitz agreed , " what does a real merchant like Scharley care if she would wear a sheitel oder not , so long as she is a lady already . " Elkan 's grin spread until it threatened to engulf his ears . " She did n't wear no sheitel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried . " I did n't think a religious woman like Mrs. Lesengeld would take off her sheitel at her time of life . " " What d'ye mean her time of life ? " Elkan cried indignantly . " Friday afternoon yet before Yetta went home from her place there at Bognor Park , Mrs. Lesengeld says to her that a widder do n't got to wear no sheitel if she do n't want to , which if you think , Mr. Scheikowitz , that fifty-three is a time of life , understand me , I think differencely , especially when I seen her with her hair all fixed up on Saturday night . " " Who fixed it ? " Marcus Polatkin asked , and Elkan grinned again . " Who d'ye suppose ? " he replied . " Why , her and Yetta spent pretty near an hour up in our room before they got through , and I tell yer with the way they turned up the hem and fixed the sleeves of one of Yetta 's black dresses , it fitted her like it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good in it ? " Scheikowitz inquired . " Did she look good in it ! " Elkan exclaimed . " Well , you can just bet your life , Mr. Polatkin , that there Hortense Feldman was n't one , two , six with her . In fact , Mr. Polatkin , you would take your oath already that there was n't two years between ' em . I had a good chance to compare ' em on account when we went down to the Hanging Gardens , understand me , Miss Feldman sits at the next table already . " Polatkin smiled broadly . " She must have had a big Schreck , " he commented . " Why , B. Gans told me last Saturday that Henry D. Feldman thinks that he 's going to fix the whole thing up between her and Scharley . " " I guess he ai n't got that idee no longer , " Elkan declared , " because everybody in Egremont knows Scharley was down visiting Mrs. Lesengeld over Sunday , and takes her and her daughter Fannie and Fannie 's husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Scheikowitz exclaimed .

" Bud Larkin , his hat pushed back on his head , looked unabashed at the scowling heavy features of the man opposite in the long , low room , and awaited a reply . " I do n't want to ruin anybody , " puffed old " Beef " Bissell , whose cattle overran most of the range between the Gray Bull and the Big Horn . " But I allow as how them sheep of yours had better stay down Nebrasky way where they come from . " " In other words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the idea of bringing them north altogether . Is that it ? " " Just about . " " Well , now , see here , Mr. Bissell , you forget one or two things . The first is , that my sheep ranch is in Montana and not Wyoming , and that I want to run my southern herds onto the northern range before fall sets in . The second is , that , while your homestead may be three hundred and twenty acres , the range that has made you rich is free . My sheep have as much right there as your cattle . It is all government land and open to everybody . " " Possession is eleven points out here where there is n't any law , " replied Bissell imperturbably . " It 's a case of your sheep against my cattle , and , you see , I stand up reg'lar for my cows . " Bud rolled a cigarette and pondered . He was in the rather bare and unornamental living-room of the Bar T ranch . In the center was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months old . The chairs , except one , were rough and heavy and without rockers . This one was a gorgeous plush patent-rocker so valued a generation ago , and evidently imported at great expense . A square of carpet that had lost all claims to pattern had become a soft blur , the result of age and alkali . However , it was one of the proudest possessions of the Bar T outfit and showed that old Beef Bissell knew what the right thing was . A calico shroud hid a large , erect object against the wall farthest away from the windows ; an object that was the last word in luxury and reckless expense  --  a piano . The walls were of boards whitewashed , and the ceiling was just plain boards . It had not taken Bud Larkin long to discern that there was a feminine cause for these numerous unusual effects ; but he did not for a minute suppose it to be the thin , sharp-tongued woman who had been washing behind the cook-house as he rode up to the corral . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But only for a minute ; other things of vaster importance held him . Although but two men had spoken during the conversation , three were in the room . The third was a man of medium height , lowering looks , and slow tongue . His hair was black , and he had the appearance of always needing a shave . He was trained down to perfect condition by his years on the plains , and was as wiry and tough as the cow pony he rode . He was Black Mike Stelton , foreman of the Bar T. " What do you think , Mike ? " asked Bissell , when Larkin made no attempt to continue the argument . " Same 's you , boss , " was the reply in a heavy voice . " I would n't let them sheep on the range , not noways . Sheep is the ruination of any grass country . " " There you see , Mr. Larkin , " said Bissell with an expressive motion of his hand . " Stelton 's been out here in the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How long did you say you had been in the West ? " " One year , " replied Larkin , flushing to the roots of his hair beneath his tanned but not weather-beaten skin . " Came from Chicago . " " From down East , eh ? Well , my woman was to St. Paul once , and she 's never got over it ; but it do n't seem to have spoiled you none . " Larkin grinned and replied in kind , but all the time he was trying to determine what stand to take . He had expected to meet opposition to " walking " his sheep north  --  in fact , had met it steadily  --  but up to this point had managed to get his animals through . Now he was fifty miles ahead of the first flock and had reached the Bar T ranch an hour before dinner . Had he been a suspected horse-thief , the unwritten social etiquette of the plains would have provided him with food and lodging as long as he cared to stay . Consequently when he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ranch house , he had turned Pinte 's head in the direction of the corral . Then , in the living-room , though no questions had been asked , Larkin had brought up the much-dreaded subject himself , as his visit was partly for that purpose . He had much to contend with . In the first place , being a sheepman , he was absolutely without caste in the cattle country , where men who went in for the " woolly idiots , " as someone has aptly called them , was considered for the most part as a degenerate , and only fit for target practice . This side of the matter troubled him not at all , however . What did worry him was the element of right in the cattlemen 's attitude ! a right that was still a wrong . For he had to acknowledge that when sheep had once fed across a range , that range was ruined for cattle for the period of at least a year . This was due to the fact that the sheep , cropping into the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , the animals on their slow marches , herded so close together that they left an offensive trail rather than follow which the cattle would stand and starve . On the other hand , the range was free and the sheep had as much right to graze there as the cattle , a fact that the cattlemen , with all their strict code of justice , refused to recognize . Larkin knew that he had come to the parting of the ways at the Bar T ranch . Old Beef Bissell was what was known at that time as a cattle king . His thousands of steers , wealth on the hoof , grazed far and wide over the fenceless prairies . His range riders rarely saw the ranch house for a month at a time , so great was his assumed territory ; his cowboys outnumbered those of any owner within three hundred miles . Aside from this , he was the head of a cattlemen 's association that had banded together against rustlers and other invaders of the range . Larkin returned to the conversation . " Try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bissell . " If you had gone in for sheep as I have  --  " " I would n't go in for ' em , " interrupted the other contemptuously , and Stelton grunted . " As you like about that . Every gopher to his own hole , " remarked Bud . " But if you had , and I guess you would if you thought there was more money in it , you would certainly insist on your rights on the range , would n't you ? " " I might try . " " And if you tried you 'd be pretty sure to succeed , I imagine . " " It 's likely ; I allow as how I 'm a pretty good hand at succeedin ' . " " Well , so am I. I have n't got very far yet , but I am on my way . I did n't come out here to make a failure of things , and I do n't intend to . Now , all I want is to run my sheep north on to the Montana range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ? " This from Stelton . " Five flocks of about two thousand each . " Bissell snorted and turned in his chair . " I wo n't allow it , young man , an ' that 's all I 've got to say . D'ye think I 'm a fool ? " " No , but neither am I. And I might as well tell you first and last that those sheep are coming north . Now , if you do the fair thing you will tell your cowboys the fact so they wo n't make any mistakes . I have given you fair warning , and if anything happens to those sheep you will be held responsible . " " Is that all you got to say ? " asked Bissell , sarcastically . " Yes . " " Well , then , I 'll do the talkin ' . I 'd as leave see Indians stampedin ' my cows into the river as have your sheep come over the range . Since you 've given me what you call a fair warning , I 'll give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't do it you 'll be a sight wiser and also a mighty sight poorer before I get through with ' em . " " Just what do you mean by that ? " asked Larkin . " I ai n't sayin ' nothin ' more than that now , because I 'm a slow hand at makin ' ornery promises , seein ' I always keep ' em . But I 'm just tellin ' you , that 's all . " " Is that your last word on the subject ? " asked Larkin . " It is , an ' I want Stelton here to remember I said it . " " Then we wo n't say anything more about the matter , " replied Bud calmly , as he rose . " I 'll go outside and look to my horse . " " You 'll stay the night with us , wo n't you ? " asked Bissell anxiously . " Yes , thanks . I 've heard so much about the Bar T I should like to see a little more of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a frown on his face , turned to Stelton . " Tell all the boys what 's happened to-day , " he said , " and tell ' em to be on the watch for this young feller 's first herd . He 'll plenty soon find out he ca n't run riot on my range . " CHAPTER II A LATE ARRIVAL After visiting the corral , Larkin paid his respects to the pump and refreshed himself for supper . Then he strolled around the long , rambling ranch house . Across the front , which faced southwest , had been built a low apology for a veranda on which a couple of uninviting chairs stood . He appropriated one of these and settled back to think . The late sun , a red-bronze color , hung just above the horizon and softened the unlovely stretches of prairie into something brooding and beautiful . Thirty miles away the Rockies had become a mass of gray-blue fleeced across the top with lines of late snow  --  for it was early June . The Bar T ranch house itself stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greenish-blue river that made a bend at this point , and that rose and had its being in the melting whiteness of those distant peaks . Between the willows of the river bottoms , Larkin could see the red reflection of the sun on the water , and could follow the stream 's course across the prairie by the snake-like procession of cottonwoods that lined its banks . On the plains themselves there was still a fading hue of green . The buffalo grass had already begun to wither under the increasing heat , and in a month would have become the same gray , cured fodder that supported millions of buffalo centuries before a steer was on the range . For Bud Larkin , only a year in the West , this evening scene had not lost its charm . He loved this hour when the men washed up at the pump . There were enticing sounds from the cook house and enticing odors in the air . Sometimes it seemed as though it almost made up for a day 's failure and discouragement . His quick eye suddenly noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranch house . It seemed to skim the ground and in five minutes had developed into a cow pony and its rider . A quarter of an hour later and the pony proved himself of " calico " variety , while the rider developed into a girl who bestrode her mount as though she were a part of the animal itself . The front rim of her broad felt hat was fastened upward with a thong and exposed her face . Bud watched her idly until she dashed up to the front of the house , fetched her horse back on its haunches with a jerk on the cruel Spanish bridle , and leaped to the ground before he had fairly lost headway . Then with a slap on the rump she sent him trotting to Stelton , who had appeared around the end of the veranda as though expecting her . Occupied with pulling off her soft white buckskin gauntlets , she did not notice the young man on the low porch until , with an exclamation , he had sprung to his feet and hurried toward her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand to her . " What are you doing here ? " " Of all people , Bud Larkin ! " cried the girl , flushing with pleasure . " Why , I ca n't believe it ! Did you drop out of the sky somewhere ? " " If the sky is heaven , I 've just dropped into it , " he returned , trying to confine his joy to intelligible speech , and barely succeeding . " That sounds like the same old Bud , " she laughed , " and it 's a pleasure to hear it . For if there is one thing a cowboy ca n't do , and it 's the only one , it is to pay a woman a compliment . That speech brands you a tenderfoot . " " Never ! I 've been out a year and can nearly ride a cow pony , providing it is lame and blind . " So , bantering each other unmercifully , they reached the front door . " Wait a few minutes , Bud , and I will be out again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone Larkin understood at once the presence of the carpet , the patent rocker , and the piano . " What a double-barreled idiot I am , " he swore , " to talk turkey to old Bissell and never connect him with Juliet . All the sheep in the world could n't get me away from here to-night . " And he ejaculated the time-worn but true old phrase that the world is a mighty small place . Juliet Bissell had been a very definite personage in Bud Larkin 's other life  --  the life that he tried to forget . The eldest son of a rich Chicago banker , his first twenty-five years had been such years as a man always looks back upon with a vast regret . From the mansion on Sheridan Drive he had varied his time among his clubs , his sports , and his social duties , and generally made himself one of many in this world that humanity can do without . In other words , he added nothing to himself , others , or life in general , and was , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing he was ever zealous , now that he had left it behind , and this was that his past should not pursue him into the new life he had chosen . He wished to start his career without stigma , and end it without blame . Strangely enough , the person who had implanted this ambition and determination in him was Juliet Bissell . Three winters before , he had met her at the charity ball , and at the time she was something of a social sensation , being described as " that cowgirl from Wyoming . " However , that " cowgirl " left her mark on many a gilded youth , and Bud Larkin was one . He had fallen in love with her , as much as one in his position is capable of falling in love , had proposed to her , and been rejected with a grace and gentleness that had robbed the blow of all hurt  --  with one exception . Bud 's pride , since his wealth and position had meant nothing in the girl 's eyes , had been sorely wounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery of the plains to reduce this pettiness to the status of a secret shame . When Juliet refused him she had told him with infinite tact that her husband would be a man more after the pattern of her father , whom she adored , and who , in turn , worshiped the very air that surrounded her ; and it was this fact that had turned Bud 's attention to the West and its opportunities . When she returned to the porch Juliet had on a plain white dress with pink ribbons at elbows , neck , and waist . Larkin , who had always thrilled at her splendid physical vigor , found himself more than ever under the spell of her luxuriant vitality . Her great dark eyes were remarkably lustrous and expressive , her black hair waved back from her brown face into a great braided coil , her features were not pretty so much as noble . Her figure , with its limber curves , was pliant and graceful in any position or emergency  --  the result of years in the saddle . Her feet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle in their touch . " Well , have you forgotten all your Eastern education ? " Larkin asked , smiling , as she sat down . " Have you reverted to your original untamed condition ? " " No , indeed , Bud . I have a reputation to keep up in that respect . The fact that I have had an Eastern education has made our punchers so proud that they ca n't be lived with when they go to town , and lord it over everybody . " " I suppose they all want to marry you ? " " Yes , singly or in lots , and sometimes I 'm sorry it ca n't be done , I love them all so much . But tell me , Bud , what brings you out West in general and here in particular ? " " Probably you do n't know that a year and a half ago my father died , " and Larkin 's face shadowed for a moment with retrospection . " Well , he did , and left me most of his estate . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would pull up stakes and start somewhere by myself . So I went up to Montana in the vicinity of the Musselshell Forks and bought a ranch and some stock . " " Cattle ? " " No , sheep . The best merino I ever saw  --  " " Bud Larkin ! You 're not a sheepman ? " " Yes , ma'am , and a menace to a large number of cowmen , your father among them . " The girl sank back and allowed him to relate the story of his adventures up to the present time , including the interview with Beef . At the description of that she smiled grimly ; and he , noting the fact , told himself that it would take a masterly character to subdue that free , wild pride . " Now , Julie , " he concluded , " do me the favor of instilling reason into your father . I 've done my best and we have parted without murder , but that 's all . I 've got to have a friend at court or I will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a few minutes and sat looking down at her slippered feet . " Bud , " she said at last , " you 've never known me to tell anything but the truth , and I 'm going to tell it to you now . I will be your friend in everything except where you ask me to yield my loyalty to my father and his interests . He is the most wonderful father a girl ever had , and if he were to say that black was white , I should probably swear to it if he asked me to . " " I admire you for that , " said Bud genuinely , although all his hopes in this powerful ally went glimmering . " Let 's not talk shop any longer . It 's too good just to see you to think about anything but that . " So , for a while , they reminisced of the days of their former friendship , by tacit agreement avoiding any reference to intimate things . And Larkin felt spring up in him the old love that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first resolution to succeed on the range , a second , that he would , in the end , conquer Juliet Bissell . The thought was pleasing , for it meant another struggle , another outlet for the energies and activities that had so long lain dormant in him . And with the undaunted courage of youth he looked eagerly toward the battle that should win this radiant girl . But for the present he knew he must not betray himself by word , look or action ; other things of greater moment must be settled . At last , as they talked , the cook , a long-suffering Chinaman , seized a huge brass bell and rang it with all his might , standing in the door of the cook house . There was an instant response in the wild whoop of the cowboys who had been suffering the pangs of starvation for the past half-hour . " Of course you must come to our private table , Bud , " said Juliet . " I want you to see father 's other side . " So they rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been planned so that to the right of the entrance was the living-room , and back of that the dining-room . To the left three smaller rooms had been made into sleeping apartments . At the back of the structure and extending across the width of it was a large room that , in the early days of the Bar T , had served as the bunk-house for the cow punchers . This had now been changed to the mess-room for them , while the family , with the addition of Stelton , the foreman , used the smaller private room . Owing to the large increase in the number of Bar T punchers a special bunk-house had been built in the rear of the main structure . At table Larkin for the first time met Mrs. Bissell , who proved to be a typical early cowman 's wife , thin , overworked , and slightly vinegary of disposition , despite the fact that she had at one time in her life been the belle of a cowtown , and had been won from beneath the ready .45 's of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grunted and scowled , and generally showed himself ill-pleased that Juliet should have known the visitor . On the other hand , as the girl had promised , Beef Bissell , for years the terror of the range , displayed a side that the sheepman would never have suspected . His voice became gentle , his laugh softened , his language purified , and he showed , by many little attentions , the unconscious chivalry that worship of a good woman brings to the surface . For her part , the girl appraised this devotion at its true value and never failed in the little feminine thoughtfulnesses that appeal so strongly to a worried and busy man . That Stelton should be at the table at all surprised Bud , for it was not the habit of foremen to eat away from the punchers . But here the fact was the result of a former necessity when Bissell , hard-pressed , had called his foreman into consultation at meal times . Old Bissell proved himself a more genial host than business rival , and when he had learned of Larkin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment and took an interest in the man . Mrs. Bissell sat open-mouthed while Bud told of the glories of Chicago in the early eighties , and never once mentioned her famous visit to St. Paul , so overcome was she with the tales this young man related . Everyone was at his or her ease when the rapid tattoo of hoofs was heard , and a horse and rider drew up abruptly at the corral . One of the punchers from the rear dining-room went out to meet him and presently appeared sheepishly in the doorway where Bissell could see him . " Is there a Mr. Larkin here ? " asked the puncher . " Yes , " said Bud , pushing back his chair . " There 's a stranger out here that ' lows he wants to see you . " " Send him in here and give him something to eat , Shorty , " sang out Bissell . " If he 's a friend of Larkin 's , he 'd better have dinner with him . And , Shorty , tell that Chinaman to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larkin , he was at a total loss to know who his visitor might be . With a sudden twinge of fear he thought that perhaps Hard-winter Sims , his chief herder , had pursued him with disastrous information from the flocks . Wondering , he awaited the visitor 's appearance . The stranger presently made a bold and noisy entrance , and , when his face came into view , Bud sank back in his chair weakly , his own paling a trifle beneath the tan . For the man was Smithy Caldwell , a shifty-eyed crook from Chicago , one who had dogged him before , and whom he had never expected to see again . How the villain had tracked him to the Bar T outfit Bud could not imagine . Seeing the eyes of the others upon him , Larkin recovered himself with an effort and introduced Caldwell ; but to the eyes of even the most unobservant it was plain that a foreign element of disturbing nature had suddenly been projected into the genial atmosphere . The man was coarse in manner and speech and often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confined her attention to Bud . " Who is this creature ? " she asked sotto voce . " What does he want with you ? " Bud hesitated , made two or three false starts , and finally said : " I am sure his business with me would not interest you . " " I beg your pardon , " said the girl , rebuffed . " I seem to have forgotten myself . " " I wish I could , " ejaculated Bud bitterly , and refused to explain further . CHAPTER III AN UNSETTLED SCORE As soon after dinner as possible Larkin disengaged himself from the rest of the party and motioned Caldwell to follow him . He led the way around the house and back toward the fence of the corral . It was already dark , and the only sounds were those of the horses stirring restlessly , or the low bellow of one of the ranch milch cows . " What are you doing out here ? " demanded Bud . " I came to see you . " The other emitted an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you want ? " " You know what I want . " This time there was no chuckle , and Bud could imagine the close-set , greedy eyes of the other , one of them slightly crossed , boring into him in the dark . " Money , I suppose , you whining blood-sucker , " suggested Bud , his voice quiet , but holding a cold , unpleasant sort of ring that was new to Caldwell . " ' The boy guessed right the very first time , ' " quoted Smithy , unabashed . " What became of that two thousand I gave you before I left Chicago ? " " I got little enough of that , " cried Caldwell . " You know how many people there were to be hushed up . " " Many ! " snapped Larkin . " You ca n't come any of that on me . There were just three ; yourself , your wife , and that red-headed fellow ,  --  I forget his name . " " Well , my wife does n't live with me any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support her just the same , and threatens to squeal on you if I do n't produce regularly ; she knows where the money comes from . " Suddenly Larkin stepped close to the other and thrust something long and hard against his ribs . " I 'm going to do for you now , Smithy , " he said in a cold , even voice . Caldwell did not even move from his position . " If you do , " was his reply , " the woman will give the whole thing to the newspapers . They have smelled a rat so long they would pay well for a tip . She has all the documents . So if you want to swing and ruin everybody concerned , just pull that trigger . " " I knew you were lying . " Bud stepped back and thrust his revolver into the holster . " You are still living with your wife , for she would n't have the documents if you were n't . A man rarely lies when he is within two seconds of death . You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never fooled me yet . Now , let 's get down to business . How much do you want ? " " Two thousand dollars . " " I have n't got it . You do n't know it , perhaps , but my money is on the hoof out in this country , and cash is very little used . Look here . You bring your wife and that red-headed chap out to Arizona or California and I will set you up in the sheep business . I 've got herds coming north now , but I 'll turn a thousand back in your name , and by the time you arrive they will be on the southern range . What do you say ? " " I say no , " replied the other in an ugly voice . " I want money , and I 'm going to have it . Good old Chi is range enough for me . " " Well , I ca n't give you two thousand because I have n't got it . " " What have you got ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'll take that on account , then , " said Caldwell insolently . " When will you have some more ? " " Not until the end of July , when the wool has been shipped East . " " All right . I 'll wait till then . Come on , hand over the five hundred . " Larkin reached inside his heavy woolen shirt , opened a chamois bag that hung by a string around his neck , and emptied it of bills . These he passed to Caldwell without a word . " If you are wise , Smithy , " he said in an even voice , " you wo n't ask me for any more . I 've about reached the end of my rope in this business . And let me tell you that this account between you and me is going to be settled in full to my credit before very long . " " Maybe and maybe not , " said the other insolently , and walked off . Five minutes later Bud Larkin , sick at heart that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his new life , made his way around the ranch house to the front entrance . Just as he was going in at the door a man appeared from the opposite side so that the two met . The other skulked back and disappeared , but in that moment Bud recognized the figure of Stelton , and a sudden chill clutched his heart . Had the foreman of the Bar T been listening and heard all ? Entering the living-room , where the Bissells were already gathered , Larkin expected to find Caldwell , but inquiry elicited the fact that he had not been seen . Five minutes later the drumming of a pony 's feet on the hard ground supplied the solution of his non-appearance . Having satisfactorily interviewed Larkin , he had mounted his horse , which all this time had been tethered to the corral , and ridden away . Half an hour later Stelton came in , his brow dark , and seated himself in a far corner of the room . From his manner it was evident that he had something to say , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over by Sioux Creek to-night , " admitted the foreman , " and he says as how the rustlers have been busy that-a-way ag'in . First thing he saw was the tracks of their hosses , and then , when he counted the herd , found it was twenty head short . I 'm shore put out about them rustlers , chief , and if something ai n't done about it pretty soon you wo n't have enough prime beef to make a decent drive . " Instantly the face of Bissell lost all its kindliness and grew as dark and forbidding as Stelton 's . Springing out of his chair , he paced up and down the room . " That has got to stop ! " he said determinedly . Then , in answer to a question of Larkin 's : " Yes , rustlers were never so bad as they are now . It 's got so in this State that the thieves have got more cows among ' em than the regular cowmen . An ' that ai n't all . They 've got an organization that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their devilment . That 's the second bunch cut out of that herd , ai n't it , Mike ? " " Yes . " Beef Bissell , his eyes flashing the fire that had made him feared in the earlier , rougher days of the range , finally stopped at the door . " Come on out with me and talk to Red , " he ordered his foreman , and the latter , whose eyes had never left Juliet since he entered the room , reluctantly obeyed . Presently Mrs. Bissell took herself off , and Bud and the girl were left alone . " I suppose you 'll marry some time , " said Larkin , after a long pause . " I sincerely hope so , " was her laughing rejoinder . " Any candidates at present ? " " Not that I know of . " " Well , I know of a very active one  --  he just left the room . " " Who , Mike ? Bud , that 's preposterous ! I 've known him ever since I was a little girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than of keeping pet rattlesnakes . " " Perhaps not , Julie , but Mike would . Will you take the word of an absolutely disinterested observer that the man is almost mad about you , and would sell his soul for one of your smiles ? " The girl was evidently impressed by the seriousness of his tone , for she pondered a minute in silence . " Perhaps you are right , Bud , " she said at last . " I had never thought of it that way . But you need n't worry ; I can take care of myself . " " I 'm sure of it , but that does n't make him any the less dangerous . Keep your eye on him , and if you ever find yourself in a place where you need somebody bad and quick , send for me . He hates me already , and I ca n't say I love him any too well ; I have an idea that he and I will come to closer quarters than will be good for the health of one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems rather lively to-night . Now , just because I am curious , will you tell me why you went into the sheep business ? " " Certainly . Because it is the future business of Wyoming and Montana . Sheep can live on less and under conditions that would kill cows . Moreover , they are a source of double profit , both for their wool and their mutton . The final struggle of the range will be between sheep and cattle and irrigation , and irrigation will win . " But the sheep will drive the cattle off the range , and , when they , in turn , are driven off , will continue to thrive in the foothills and lower mountains , where there is no irrigation . I went into the sheep business to make money , but I wo n't see much of that money for several years . When I am getting rich , cowmen like your father will be fighting for the maintenance of a few little herds that have not been pushed off the range by the sheep . Cattle offer more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are doomed . " " Bud , that 's the best defense of wool-growing I ever heard , " cried the girl . " Up to this I 've held it against you that you were a sheepman  --  a silly prejudice , of course , that I have grown up with  --  but now you can consider yourself free of that . I believe you have hit the nail on the head . " " Thanks , I believe I have , " said Bud dryly , and a little while later they separated for the night , but not before he had remarked : " I think it would benefit all of us if you drilled some of that common-sense into your father . " CHAPTER IV THE SIX PISTOL SHOTS The next morning , after breakfast , which shortly followed the rising of the sun , Bissell called Bud Larkin aside just as that young man had headed for the corral to rope and saddle Pinte . Gone was any hint of the man of the night before . His red face was sober , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piercing , almost menacing , intensity . " I hope any friend of Julie 's will continue to be my friend , " was all he said , but the glance and manner attending this delicate hint left no doubt as to his meaning . His whole attitude spelled " sheep ! " " That depends entirely upon you , Mr. Bissell , " was Larkin 's rejoinder . The cowman turned away without any further words , and Bud continued on to the corral . At the enclosure he found Stelton roping a wiry and vicious calico pony , and when he had finally cinched the saddle on Pinte , he turned to see Julie at his side . " You had better invite me to ride a little way with you , " she said , laughing , " because I am coming anyhow . " " Bless you ! What a treat ! " cried Bud happily , and helped to cinch up the calico , who squealed at every tug . Stelton , his dark face flushed to the color of mahogany , sullenly left him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bud , with a loud " So-long " and a wave of the hand to some of the punchers , turned south . Julie , loping beside him , looked up curiously at this . " I thought you were going north , Bud , " she cried . " Changed my plans overnight , " he replied non-committally , and she did not press the subject further , feeling , with a woman 's intuition , that war was in the air . Ten miles south , at the ford of the southern branch of Grass Creek , she drew up her horse as the signal for their separation , and faced north . Bud , still headed southward , put Pinte alongside of her and took her hand . " It 's been a blessing to see you , you 're so civilized , " she said , half-seriously . " Do come again . " " Then you do sometimes miss the things you have been educated to ? " " Yes , Bud , I do , but not often . Seeing you has brought back a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And that is what you have done for me , dear girl , " he said in a low tone as he pressed her hand . The next moment , with a nonchalant " So-long , " the parting of the plains , he had dug the spurs into his horse and ridden away . For a minute the girl sat looking after this one link between her desolate existence and the luxury and society he still represented in her eyes . " His manners have changed for the worse , " she thought , recalling his abrupt departure , " but I think he has changed for the better . " Which remark proves that her sense of relative masculine values was still sound . Larkin continued on directly south-east for twenty miles , until he crossed the Big Horn at what is now the town of Kirby . Thence his course lay south rather than east until he should raise the white dust of his first flock . With regard to his sheep , Larkin , in all disputed cases , took the advice of his chief herder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet one who seemed to divine the numbed sheep intelligence in a manner little short of marvelous . Sims he had picked up in Montana , when that individual , unable to perform the arduous duties of a cowboy , had applied for a job as a sheep-herder  --  not so much because he liked the sheep , but because he had to eat and clothe himself . By one of those rare accidents of luck Sims at last found his metier , and Larkin the prince of sheepmen . When Bud had determined to " walk " ten thousand animals north , Sims had accompanied him to help in the buying , and was now superintending the long drive . On his advice the drive had been divided into five herds of two thousand , he contending that it was dangerous , as well as injurious to the sheep , to keep more than that number together . The others were following at intervals of a few days . Larkin had left the leaders just north of the hills that formed the hooked southern end of the Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time they would have come north almost to the junction of Kirby Creek and the Big Horn , near where it was calculated to cross them . After grazing his horse for an hour at noon , and taking a bite to eat himself , Larkin pushed on , and , in a short time , made out a faint , whitish mist rising against the horizon of hills . It was the dust of his leaders . Presently , in the far distance , a man appeared on horseback making toward him , and Bud wondered if anything had happened . His fears were partially justified when he discovered the horseman to be Sims , and were entirely confirmed when he had conversed with the herder . " We 've sure got to get them sheep to water , and that mighty quick , " was the latter 's laconic announcement . " Nonsense ! There 's plenty of water . What 's the matter with ' em ? " " Ten miles out of the hills we found a water-hole , but the cattle had been there first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camp last night there was another hole , but some imp had deviled the herd an ' they lay alongside the water , dyin ' of thirst , but they would n't drink . We pushed ' em in an ' they swam around ; we half-drowned some of ' em , but still they would n't drink . " So we made a night march without finding water , and we have n't found any to-day . They 're gettin ' frantic now . " Bud quirted the tired Pinte into a gallop , and they approached the herd , about which the dark , slim figures of the dogs were running . From the distance the first sound was the ceaseless blethering of the flock that proclaimed its misery . The next was the musical tinkling of the bells the leaders wore . " Reckon they 've found another hole , " said Sims . " Thought I seen one when I was ridin ' out . " On nearer approach it was seen that the herd was " milling , " that is , revolving in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half smothered in the dust they raised , without aim or knowledge of what they did , or why . About the herd at various points stood the half-dozen shepherds , their long crooks in their hands . Whenever a blatting animal made a dash for liberty the dogs drove it into the press , barking and nipping . Larkin rode to a tall , dark-skinned shepherd , a Basque from the California herding . " What is it , Pedro ? " he asked . " What is the matter with them ? " " Only the good God can tell . The leaders they take fright at something , I do not know , and we ' mill ' them before any damage is done . " Larkin rode around the trampling , bawling mass to the rear , where were the cook wagon and a couple of spare horses . He at once dismounted and changed his uncomfortable riding-boots for the brogans of the herder . Pinte he relegated to the string , for the use of a horse with sheep is ludicrous , since the dogs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uplifted arms of the men . When he rejoined Sims , the sheep had become calmer . The flock-mind , localized in the leaders , had come to the conclusion that , after all , there was nothing to fear , and the circling motion was gradually becoming slower and slower . In a quarter of an hour comparative quiet had been restored , and Sims gave the order to get the flock under way . Since they had not come upon water at this place , as the herder had hoped , it was necessary to continue the merciless drive until they found it . Immediately the dogs cut into the dirty-white revolving mass ( the smell of which is like no other in the world ) , and headed the leaders north . But the leaders and tail-enders were inextricably mixed , and for a long time there was great confusion . Sheep on the march have one invariable position , either among the leaders , middlers or tailers , and until each animal has found his exact post , nothing whatever can be done with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then , under the trotting of the dogs , took position on the brow of a rising hill , as though bedding down for the night . But all did not rest , for perhaps fifty remained standing in the perpetual flock-watch . In an hour these would lie down and others take their places , but all through the night , and at any time when the flock rested , this hereditary protection would become operative  --  seemingly a survival of a day when neither man nor dog had assumed this duty . The cook dug his trench , built his fire and set his folding table out under the pale sky that was just commencing to show brilliant stars . After the last cup of steaming coffee had been downed and pipes lighted , Sims gave the order to march . The herd was nearly still now , and roused with much complaining , but the dogs were inexorable , and presently the two thousand were shuffling on , feeding now and then , but making good progress . There was but one thing left to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was certain that all the springs on the plain would have been visited by cattle , and that , therefore , the sheep would stand by and idly perish of thirst . Sims knew his country , and directed the flock toward a shallow , rocky ford of the Big Horn , some five miles distant . In the meantime Bud Larkin was facing two alternatives , either one disastrous . The crossing of the Big Horn meant a declaration of war to the Bar T ranch , for in the loose division of the free country , the Bar T range extended south to the river . On the other hand , should he turn the herds east along the bank of the Big Horn , it would be impossible to continue the march long in that direction , since the higher mountains were directly ahead , and the way through them was devious , and attended with many difficulties and dangers . On such a drive the losses to him in time and strayed sheep would be disastrous . Larkin had no desire to clash with the cattlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sheep should go through , since the free range was his as well as another 's . On that long night march , when the men were behind the sheep , driving them , contrary to the usual custom , he told Sims of his interview with Beef Bissell , and the herder cracked his knuckles with rage at the position taken by the cowman . " Send ' em through , Mr. Larkin , " he advised , " and if the Bar T outfit start anything I allow we 'll return ' em as good as they give . " It was within an hour of dawn when the leaders of the flock lifted their heads and gazed curiously at the line of trees that loomed before them along the banks of the river . The next instant they had started forward on a run , blethering the news of water back along the dim , heaving line . The dust beneath their sharp feet rose up into a pall that hid the sky as the whole flock got into motion . Then dogs and men leaped forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animals was more disastrous than when they refused to drink . Working madly , the dogs spread out the following herd so that all should not crowd upon the same point of the river and drown the leaders . It was unavoidable that some should be lost by being pushed into the deeper waters north or south of the ford , but for the most part the watering was successfully accomplished , and at the first glow of dawn the animals were contentedly cropping the rich grasses in the low bottoms near the river . But the work was not yet finished . When it had become light enough to see , the leaders were rounded up at the ford , and , nipped into frenzy by the dogs , began the passage across the shallow bar . With the leaders safely over it was only a matter of time until the rest had followed , and by the time it was full day the last of the tailers were feeding in the opposite bottoms . For Bud Larkin this was a very serious dawn . He had cast the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's country . Any hope that the act might remain unknown was shattered before the sheep had fairly forded the stream . Against the brightening sky , on a distant rise of ground , had appeared the silent figure of a horse and man , one of the Bar T range riders . Six distant , warning pistol shots had rung out , and then the horse and rider had disappeared across the plain at a headlong gallop . CHAPTER V STRATEGY AND A SURPRISE " Gub pi-i-i-le ! " yelled the cook at the top of his voice . The weary herders with Sims and Larkin answered the cry as one man , for they were spent with the exertions of the night , and heavy-eyed from want of sleep . The meal of mutton , camp-bread , beans , and Spanish onions was dispatched with the speed that usually accompanied such ceremonies , and Sims told off the herders to watch the flock while the others slept . A general commanding soldiers would have pressed forward , thus increasing the advantage gained in the enemy 's country , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last thing consulted . After their long thirst and forced drive it was necessary that the animals recover their strength for a day amid abundant feed and water . Immediately after breakfast Larkin called a small , close-knit herder to him . " Can you ride a horse ? " he asked . " Si , senor , " replied the man , who came originally from the southern range . " Then saddle that piebald mare and take provisions for four days . Travel day and night until you reach the Larkin ranch in Montana , and give this letter to the man who is in charge there . " Bud drew a penciled note from the pocket of his shirt and handed it to the other . Then he produced a rough map of the country he had drawn and added it to the letter , explaining a number of times the distances from point to point , and tracing the route with his pencil . At last the herder understood . " Tell them to hurry , " was Larkin 's parting injunction , as the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senor . Hurry like blazes , eh ? " said Miguel , comprehending , with a flash of white teeth . " Exactly . " Hardly had the man galloped away north , following the bank of the river for the better concealment past the Bar T range , when Sims languidly approached . " I reckon we 're in for trouble , boss , " he remarked , yawning sleepily , " an ' I 'm plumb dyin ' for rest , but I s'pose I better look over the country ahead if we 're goin ' to get these muttons out o ' here . " " I was just going to suggest it , " said Larkin . " I am going to stay by the camp and meet some friends of mine that I expect very shortly . Come back pronto , Hardy , for there 's no telling what we may have to do before night . " Larkin 's predictions of a visit were soon enough fulfilled . It was barely ten o'clock when several horsemen were seen riding toward the banks of the Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First came Beef Bissell , closely attended by Stelton , and after them , four or five of the Bar T punchers . The actual encounter took place half a mile from the camp . Looking back , Larkin could see his sheep feeding in plain sight amid the green of the river bottoms . " Howdy , " snapped Bissell , by way of greeting . And then , without waiting for a reply : " What does this mean ? " He indicated the placid sheep . " My flock was dying of thirst , and I brought them up last night , " said Bud . " They crossed the river early this morning . " " Why did n't you keep them on the other side ? I warned you about this . " Illustration : " I warned you first , Mr. Bissell . My sheep have got to go North and the range West of the Big Horn is the only practicable way to drive them . " " I warned you first , Mr. Bissell . My sheep have got to go north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only practicable way to drive them . They would never come through if I started them through the mountains . You ought to know that . " " Never mind what I ought to know , " cried Bissell angrily , his red face flaming with fury . " There 's one thing I do know , and that is , that those range-killers do n't go a step farther north on my side of the river . " " If you can show me clear title to ownership of this part of the range I will risk them in the mountains ; otherwise not , " replied Bud , imperturbably . " This range is free , and as much mine as yours . There 's no use going into this question again . " " That 's the first true thing you 've said , " snarled the cowman . " Now , you listen here . I do n't go hunting trouble nowhere , but there ai n't a man between the Rio Grande and the Columbia that can say I do n't meet it half-way when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've given you fair warnin ' before . I 'll give it to you again , but this is the last time . Either you have them sheep t' other side of the river by this time to-morrow , or you take the consequences . " " Is that your final word on the matter ? " " Yes . An ' I 've got witnesses to prove that you were given a chance to clear out . " " Then you give me only twenty-four hours ? " " Yes . " Bud 's face took on a look of discouragement and failure , and he sat for a time as though seeking a loophole of escape from his ultimatum . At last he lifted his head and looked at the cowman with a listless eye . " All right , " he said , hopelessly ; " I 'll be gone by that time . " And , without further words , he wheeled his horse slowly and rode back to the camp . As he rode he maintained his dejected attitude , but his mind was actively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mask of seeming defeat he sought to find means for an unexpected victory . Though his whole being rose in revolt against the arbitrary claims of the cattle king , he had become so hardened to this injustice everywhere that he no longer wasted his time or strength in vain railings against it . Instinctively he felt that this was to be a struggle of strength against cunning , for the very thought of physical resistance to thirty fighting cowboys by half a dozen herders was ridiculous . Many similar skirmishes , both on his home ranch and on the trail , had sharpened Larkin 's wits for emergencies , and it was with really no spirit of humble complaisance that he faced the future . Much , however , depended on the result of Sim 's explorations . By the time Larkin arrived at the camp the visiting cowmen had disappeared . But this did not mean for a moment that they had all returned to the Bar T ranch house . Merely to top the first hill would have been to see a horse with hanging bridle , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the north . As fortune would have it , Sims slunk into camp just at the dinner hour . " What 'd they say to yuh ? " he asked abruptly . " I seen the confab from over on that hogback yonder . " The herder 's respect for his employer sometimes diminished to the vanishing point . " Got to clear out in twenty-four hours or take what 's comin ' . " " What'd'ye tell ' em ? " " I said we would . " The lank herder started back in amazement . " Oh , blazes ! " he grieved . " That I should 've ever took on with a milksop boss . I 'm plumb disgraced  --  " His voice trailed off into silence as he recognized the twinkle in Larkin 's eye . " Oh , I see what yuh mean , " he apologized , with a wide grin . " We 'll clear out all right . Oh , yes ! Sure ! " He sat down . " Depends on you a good deal , " remarked Bud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find this morning ? " " Found a new way north , " was the muffled and laconic reply . " Yaas , " he continued presently , after regarding his reflection in the bottom of a tin cup that had been full of coffee the moment before , " an ' it 's over on that hogback . " A " hogback , " be it understood , is a rugged rocky mound , carved by weather erosion . It is the result of the level rock strata of the plains suddenly bending upward and protruding out of the earth . " That ridge runs north for about two mile , and at the end seems to turn east into the Big Horn foothills . So far as I can see , no man or critter has ever been there , for there ai n't any water in that crotch , and nothin ' else but heat and rattlers . The point of the thing is this : Spring rains for a couple of million years have wore a regular watercourse down that crotch , and I think we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , but wo n't they be out on the open Bar T range when we get them over ? " " No , boss . D'ye think I 'd do a thing like that ? Honest , the way you misjudge a man ! Well , across that hogback , where it turns to the east , there is a string of range hills covered with good feed , and leadin ' north , for twenty miles . My idea 's this : " I 'll send Pedro with about a hundred rams and wethers directly north from here , as they 're expecting we will . All of them will have bells on , and Pedro 'll have to prod ' em some to make ' em bawl . While he is drawing all the trouble , we 'll hustle the rest of the flock along behind the hogback , over the pass , and north behind the shelter of the hills . " " Fine , Sims ; just the thing ! " exclaimed Larkin , taking up with the idea enthusiastically . " It will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flock north once it has gone twenty miles . " " I allow that perhaps the Bar T punchers will be watchin ' that hogback , although I could n't find tracks there , new or old . If they ever catch the sheep in that gully , you 're due to wish you 'd stayed East . " " Well , that 's our risk , and we 've got to take it . Now , I think we 'd better roll up for a few hours this afternoon , for we did n't sleep last night , and I do n't believe we will to-night . Have Pedro call us at half-past four , and have him round up the sheep about five . " Sheep , because of some perverse twist in their natures , can not graze standing still . They must walk slowly forward a few steps every few moments . To-day , however , because of the luxuriant grass along the river , the progress of the flock had been comparatively slow . Their day 's " walk " would bring them , Larkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the hogback , and an ideal spot from which to start the march . Pedro called the two men at the appointed hour , and they reached the flock just in time for the bedding down . Immediately all hands went through the sheep , removing bells from the animals that usually wore them , and fastening them about the necks of those delegated to act as a blind and cover the advance of the main body . To a Bar T cow-puncher who knew anything about sheep , the evening scene would have exhibited nothing out of the ordinary . From the reclining hundreds came the soft bleating of ewes calling their young , which is only heard at the daily bedding , the low-toned blethering of the others of the flock , and the tinkle of bells . Beside the cook wagon the fire glowed in the trench , and everything seemed to be progressing normally . Twilight came early among the trees and brush near the river , but it was not until absolute darkness had descended over the vast expanse of prairie that Larkin gave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herd , with Sims at its head , the dogs flanking and Bud bringing up the rear on horseback , moved silently out toward the unknown hazards of the hogback pass . Pedro and his hundred had been ordered to wait fifteen minutes , until the head of the column should have almost reached the shelter of the hogback . This he did , and then headed his small flock straight up the open prairie of the range , amid a chorus of bells and loud-voiced protest . Larkin , half a mile away , heard these sounds and smiled grimly , for the flocks before him made scarcely any sound at all . In the darkness ahead he could hear the low voices of the men talking to the dogs and encouraging the unresponsive sheep . Overhead were the brilliant , low-swinging stars that gave just enough light to show him the trend of the long , heaving line . For another half-hour there was silence . The sounds of Pedro and his flock became fainter as the two bodies diverged from each other . Now the dark wall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last of the flock was behind shelter . The going was rough and Pinte chose each step carefully , but the sheep made good progress , because there was no grass to tempt them . After another long space , broken only by the clatter of hard little feet on stone , distant shots rang out , accompanied by faint yells , and Larkin knew that Pedro had met with the first of the Bar T outfit . The sheepman was resigned to losing the hundred , just as cattlemen do not hesitate to cut out and abandon all weak animals on a long drive . It is a loss credited to the ultimate good of the business , but Bud had not consented to this sacrifice if it meant also the sacrifice of the herder . Pedro had , however , with many winks and glintings of teeth , made it clear that he did not expect to depart this life yet a while , hinting mysteriously at certain charms , amulets and saints that made it a business to keep him among the living . Pedro , to Bud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had always reappeared , rather the worse for wear , but perfectly sound in all respects . He did not doubt but what the Spaniard would turn up at the cook wagon for breakfast . The sounds of distant conflict continued for perhaps five or ten minutes , at the end of which time perfect silence reigned again . Larkin wondered how many of the animals had been killed , or whether they had been merely scattered  --  the equivalent of death , for a sheep is unable to find water , and if frightened , will back against a face of rock and starve to death . Another half-hour passed , and now Larkin could see the dim white backs of the herd rising before him as they climbed the steep watercourse . He judged that more than half the flock must be down the precipitous other side , and his heart beat with exultation at the success of Sim 's strategy . The plan was to hide the sheep in some little green valley during the day and march them at night until discovered or until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last of the flock was mounting the ascent , Larkin drew Pinte up short and listened intently . Then he quickly dismounted and placed his ear to the ground only to leap into the saddle again , swing his horse quickly and ride back along the trail . He had heard the unmistakable pounding of feet , and an instant 's sickening fear flashed before him the possibility that the Bar T cowboys had discovered the ruse after all ; either that or they had extorted the secret of it from Pedro . Larkin loosened the pistol in his holster , one of those big , single-action wooden-handled forty-fives that have settled so many unrecorded disputes , and prepared to cover the rear of the herd until it had safely crossed the hogback . Pinte 's ears twitched forward . The sound of galloping feet was nearer now . Larkin clapped on spurs and trotted to meet it . Closer and closer it came , a mingled clatter of hoofs . Then suddenly there rang out the frightened bawl of a bewildered calf . The aspects of the situation took on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shots and shouting on the plain , they would have made a vastly different thundering along the earth . Cattle never ran this way by themselves ; therefore the obvious inference was that they were driven . Again , the Bar T punchers had no call to drive cattle at night , particularly this night . Who , then , was driving them ? In an instant Larkin 's mind had leaped these various steps of reasoning and recalled old Beef Bissell 's vehement arraignment of rustlers in the State . The answer was plain . The calves were being driven off the range into concealment by cattle-thieves . Larkin knew that all the sheep had not yet passed the top of the hogback . It was absolutely necessary that their passage be unknown and unobserved . There was but one thing to do . Spurring his horse , he charged toward the oncoming animals , whose dark forms he could now discern a hundred yards away . As he rode , he shouted and drew his revolver , firing into their faces . When at last it seemed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned , snorting , to the east and made off in the direction of the river . His purpose accomplished , Larkin wheeled Pinte sharply and dug in his spurs , but at that instant two dark forms loomed close , one on each side , and seized the bridle . " Hands up ! " said a gruff voice . " You 're covered . " CHAPTER VI UGLY COMPANY Larkin 's revolver was empty , and his hands mechanically went up . The captor on his right relieved him of the useless weapon , and , in a trice , produced a rope , with which he bound the sheepman 's arms tightly behind him . With the other end of the rope turned about the pommel of his saddle , he dropped back into the darkness , while his companion rode to a position ahead of Larkin . At a growled word from behind , the little cavalcade advanced , Larkin mystified , uncertain and fuming with impotent rage . Never in his life had he been so needed as he was at that time by Sims and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ardently desired liberty and freedom of action . Why these men had captured him he did not know ; what they intended doing with him he had no idea  --  although his knowledge of plainsmen 's character supplied him with two or three solutions hardly calculated to exhilarate the victim . Where they were taking him was almost as much of a puzzle , for Bud , after the first few turns of his captors , completely lost his sense of direction , except for the general compass of the stars . No longer the friendly loom of the hogback was on his left . He felt the free wind of the plains on his face , and calculated that they must have returned to the open range . Who his captors were was another puzzle . If these men had been driving the cattle why did they not continue to drive them instead of turning aside to make prisoner a harmless sheepman ? If they were not driving the cattle  --  A horrible suspicion crossed Bud 's mind . If these were punchers from the Bar T outfit he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than Larkin ( by hearsay ) the wild stories told of Beef Bissell 's methods in a cattle war . The young man told himself calmly that if he got away with a few head of sheep and an entire body he would consider himself fortunate in the extreme . For seemingly endless ages the leader trotted on ahead  --  so far , in fact , did he ride that Larkin 's arms and elbow joints were racked with pain from being held so long in an unnatural position . At the end of what was probably three hours , a small fiery glow made itself evident at some distance across the plain , and the sheepman knew by this camp-fire that the goal of his ride was in sight . A solitary man sat by the fire , rolling and smoking a continuous stream of cigarettes . Dimly seen in the near-by shadows were the long figures of other men rolled in their blankets . Bud knew that not far off the hobbled horses grazed , or had lain down to rest . " Kick up the boys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Got somethin ' queer to look into this time . " " Aw , let ' em sleep , chief , " drawled Bill without moving . " Some of ' em ai n't closed their eyes in nigh on three days . What 's the matter ? " " Got a young captain here who ' lows he 's some brave man , I reckon . Leastways he come drivin ' at us with fire a-poppin ' out of his gun , an ' Shorty and me thinks we better investigate . So we nabs him when his gun 's empty and brings him in . A man that 'll shoot around reckless the way this feller did is plumb dangerous to have runnin ' loose . " But I guess you 're right about the boys , Bill . I 'll let ' em sleep an ' we 'll talk to this maverick in the mornin ' . Keep him under your eye . " Things were clearing up for Larkin . These men evidently thought that he was some ambitious puncher on the lookout for rustlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrowing no trouble and trusting to his ability to identify himself . But now at the prospect of idling here all night and part of the day he protested . " Turn my arms loose , will you ? " he demanded . " They 're about broke off . " Joe , the chief , after carefully searching him for additional weapons , complied with his request , in so far that he bound his wrists together in front . " Now , boys , " said Bud , crisply , " I wish you 'd tell me what this all means . If you want to question me , do it now and let me go , for I 've got mighty important business up the line a way . " " I allow yuh have , " remarked Joe , dryly . " Yuh also got some mighty important business right here , if yuh only knowed it . " " What business . " " Fannin ' yore gun at us that-a-way . Yore plumb careless , young feller . But look here , I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yuh . You 'll have to talk to all the boys in the mornin ' . " " But I ca n't wait till morning , I tell you , " cried Bud , exasperated . " Every minute I sit here I may be losing thousands of dollars . For Heaven 's sake let me go to-night , and I 'll come back any other time you say . I give you my word for it . " " Ca n't wait till to-morrer ! Stranger , you may wait till the crack o ' doom before you ever get back to that business o ' yourn . " " What do you mean by that ? " asked Larkin , made strangely ill at ease by some veiled meaning in the other 's tone . " Got to leave it to the boys , " was Joe 's evasive reply . " Better lay down and git some sleep ; likely to be busy all day to-morrer . " And Larkin , finding that all argument was as futile as trying to crack Gibraltar with a cold chisel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could until daylight . Morning disclosed the fact that the group of men numbered about ten , each with a horse near by , and all fully supplied with arms . In fact , there was not a man among them who could not have " rolled a gun " with both hands if necessary , and at the same time carried a knife between his teeth . This matter of complete armament , together with Joe 's ambiguous speeches of the night before , wholly convinced Larkin that he had fallen in with a band of rustlers . Breakfast was prepared for himself by each man , Joe attending to the wants of the prisoner , but no attempt was made to rope or saddle the horses . They were evidently waiting for something . What this was became evident shortly when another group of five men appeared around a distant rise and loped to the rendezvous . Larkin reasoned that these must be the men who continued the cattle drive after Joe and Pike had captured him . The sheepman could not but admire the natural advantages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rolling hills surrounded the little pocket on all sides , and here and there a red scoria butte thrust its ugly height out of the plain . The chances of discovery were infinitesimal . The evolution of the rustler was logical but rapid , and started with the general law that any ranch-owner was at liberty to brand with his mark any maverick found on his range . As it was the cowboy who discovered these strays , he was usually provided with a branding-iron and put the seal of his employer on the animal wherever found . From this it was but a step for unscrupulous punchers , or those with a shrewd eye for business , to drive off unbranded cattle and ship them independently to market , or to mark them with a private brand of their own . All this was before the introduction of brand inspectors at the stockyards of Omaha , Kansas City , or Chicago . Therefore , among the men at this rendezvous Larkin noted types of cowmen equal to any on the range for horsemanship and ability to handle cattle . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but failed to recognize any of them . His case came up quickly . By various papers in his possession he proved his identity . " What were you doing out on the range last night ? " asked Joe . Bud hesitated for a minute and then , deciding that his safest and quickest course would be to make a clean breast of things , replied : " I was driving two thousand head of sheep north on the Bar T. " " Then you 're not a cattleman ? " " No . " Larkin produced his bills of sale for the sheep and these were handed gravely about from one to another , although it was certain that some of the men could not read them . " How long are you going to stay in this country ? " " Just as long as it takes to get my sheep north . I come from Montana . " Joe beckoned a number of the men aside out of Larkin 's hearing . " We 're plumb lucky , " he announced . " If I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few missin ' calves when he knows this feller has sent sheep up his range . Now we 've got to run off about a hundred more head to that railroad camp north of here , and I think we can use this Larkin . " A dark , sullen-looking puncher shook his head slowly . " It 's takin ' chances , " he growled . " String him up , I say . He knows us all now , and I 'd sooner he 'd look through a rope than me . " " You shore are ornery , Pete , " said a third , " an ' plumb set on stretchin ' yore neck . Cai n't yuh see that if yuh hang this feller we 'll have both the sheep and cattlemen ag'in us ? " " Shore , that 's sense , " broke in another . " Less hear Joe 's scheme . " " ' Tai n't so blame much , boys , " countered the chief modestly . " We 'll make this Larkin swear never to give word agin us if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him off into the hills for four or five days with a guard , finish our own drive , and clear out , lettin ' him go . What d'ye think of that ? " " It 's a reg'lar hum-dinger , Joe , " said one man , and the others concurred in the laudatory opinion . But at the first sentence to Larkin , that young man upset their well-laid plans . " Larkin , " said Joe , " we allow as how we 'd like to make a bargain with yuh ? " " If you are going to bargain with me to break the law , you had better not say anything about it , " was the reply . " I was jest about startin ' one of them mutual protective , benefit and literary sassieties , " suggested Joe tactfully as a feeler , while his comrades grinned . " Do n't want to hear about it , " retorted Bud , divining the intention . " You can do anything you like with me , but do n't tell me your bargains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on any more . Now , look here , men , I do n't want to interfere with you , and it only wastes your time to bother with me . Suppose you let me go about my business and you go about yours . " " Swear on oath never to recognize or bear witness against us ? " " No . What kind of a crook do you think I am ? If I were put under oath by a sheriff , I would have to accuse you , and I 'd do it . " Joe Parker 's face lost its expression of genial amiability and he looked about on a circle of dark countenances . " I 'm plumb sorry you act this-a-way , " he said aggrievedly . " Boys , where 's the nearest tree ? " " Ten miles . " " After dinner everybody saddle up , " came the order . CHAPTER VII PRAIRIE BELL When Juliet Bissell rode back to the Bar T ranch after her parting with Larkin at the fork of Grass Creek , she was a decidedly more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same hour the day previous . Although blessed with an adoring father and a rather eccentric mother , she had , for the last year , begun to feel the stirrings of a tiny discontent . Her life was a good example of the familiar mistake made by many a wealthy cattle-owner . Her parents , realizing their crudity and lack of education , had seen to it that she should be given all the advantages denied them , and had sent her East to Chicago for eight consecutive years . During this time , while hating the noise and confinement of the city , she had absorbed much of its glamour , and enjoyed its alluring pleasures with a keen appreciation . Music had been her chief study , and her very decided talent had opened a busy career for her had she chosen to follow it . But Julie was true to her best instincts , and refused to consider such a thing . Her father and mother had done all in their power for her , she reasoned , and therefore it was but fair that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lives happy . Though nothing had ever been said , the girl knew that when she had left the ranch house , even for a week 's visit with a girl friend two hundred miles away , the sun might as well have fallen from the heavens , considering the gloom that descended upon the Bar T. It was this knowledge of their need for her that had brought her back to fulfill what she considered her greatest happiness and duty in life . Now , a monkey can not wear clothes , smoke cigarettes , perform before applauding audiences and return to the jungle without a certain feeling of hateful unfitness among his gibbering brethren . No more could this wild , lovely creature of the plains become one of the most sought-after girls of Chicago 's North Shore set , and return to the painful prose of the Bar T ranch without paying the penalty . With the glory of health and outdoor life , she had failed to realize this , but since the sudden appearance of Bud Larkin she had done little else . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life she had once known . And had old Beef Bissell been aware of this nostalgia , he would have realized for the first time that in his desire to give his daughter everything he had created a situation that was already unfortunate and might , with very little prompting , be unhappy . But this knowledge was not vouchsafed to him , and Julie certainly would never make it plain . The evening after Bud 's departure , that same evening , in fact , when he was fighting toward water with his flocks , the cattleman and his daughter sat outside on the little veranda that ran across the front of the ranch house . " That feller Larkin , " remarked Bissell , terminating a long pause . " Kind of a dude or something back East , was n't he ? " " That 's what the punchers would call him , father , " returned the girl gravely . " But he was never anything but a gentleman in his treatment of me . " " I do n't know what you mean exactly by that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no real man ever went into raisin ' sheep . " " Perhaps not , dear , " she said , taking his rough , ungainly hand in both of hers , " but I think there is bound to be money in it . Mr. Larkin himself says that in the end the cattle will have to give way before the sheep . " " An ' he thought he was tellin ' you something new when he said it , too , did n't he ? Well , I 've knowed that fact for the last five years . That 's the main reason I wo n't let his animals through my range . Once they get a foothold , there 's no stoppin ' ' em . Judas ! I 'm tired of fightin ' for things ! " " Poor father , " and the girl 's voice was full of tenderness . " You 're not discouraged , are you , dear ? " " No , Prairie Bell , but I reckon I 'm gettin ' old , an ' I ca n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had my hands full with the rustlers , but now with the sheep comin '  --  well , between you and me , little girl , I wish I had somebody to stand up and take the licks . " " There 's Mike ; he certainly can give and take a few . " " Yes , of course I 've got Mike , but , when you 're all done , he 's only a foreman , an ' his interest do n't go much beyond his seventy-five a month an ' grub . Yet  --  by George ! " He sat suddenly erect and slapped his thigh with his disengaged hand . " What is it ? " " Oh , nothin ' . " They talked on in the affectionate , intimate way that had always characterized their relations since Julie had been a girl just big enough to listen to involved harangues about cattle without actually going to sleep . In the course of an hour Bissell suddenly asked : " Did you ever think of marryin ' , Prairie Bell ? " " If thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this time . " " Well , you are growed up , ai n't you ? " and Bissell spoke in the wondering tone of a man who has just realized a self-evident fact " Fancy my little girl old enough to marry ! How old are you , anyhow ? ' Bout eighteen ? " " Twenty-five , you dear , old goose . Eighteen ! The idea . " " Well , twenty-five , then . Of course , Julie , when I die I will leave this place to you , and that 's what made me think about your marryin ' . I want a good , sharp man to fight fer my cows an ' my range , a man that knows it and could make a success of it , an ' yet would n't care because it was in your name . " " Would you mind if I loved him a little bit , too ? " asked the girl , with elaborately playful sarcasm . " Bless you , no . Love him all you want to , but I ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have all them qualifications I mentioned . I figger love out somethin ' like this . First there 's a rockbed of ability , then a top soil of decency , an ' out o ' these two , admiration kind o ' grows like corn . Of course you always grind up the corn and soak it with sentiment ; then you 've got mush . An ' the trouble with most people is they only think of the mush an ' forget the rock an ' the top soil . " " Why , you old philosopher ! " cried the girl , laughing and squeezing his big shoulders . " You 're awfully clever , really . " Which remark brought a confused but pleased blush to Bissell 's hard face that had become wonderfully soft and tender during this hour with his daughter . " Now , see here , " went on the girl severely , " I think there 's something back of all this talk about marriage . What is it ? " Bissell looked at her , startled , not having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only I wish you could marry somebody that 'd look out fer you the way I mentioned . Then I could die happy , though I do n't expect to be on that list fer a long while . " " Anybody in mind ? " asked Julie banteringly . " Well , not exactly , " hesitated her father , with another sharp glance . " But I allow I could dig up one if I tried very hard . " " Go ahead and try . " " Well , now there 's Billy Speaker over on the Circle Arrow , as gentle a man for a blond as I ever see . " " I 've only met him twice in my life , " remarked the girl . " Try again . " " There 's Red Tarken , foreman on the M Square . He 'd be good to yuh , I know , and he 's a hum-dinger about cows . " " I am glad he has one qualification aside from his red hair , " put in Julie seriously . " However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about as steady as a bronco saddled for the first time after the winter feeding . He 'd better have free range as long as he lives . Once more , father . " " Well , see here , Julie , it seems to me you could do a lot worse than take our own Mike Stelton . I 've never thought of it much before , but to-night it sort of occurred to me an '  --  " Juliet Bissell broke into an uncontrollable fit of laughter , at which her father fixed her with a regard as wondering as it was hurt . His cherished inspiration so tactfully approached had burst like a soap-bubble under the gale of Juliet 's merriment . " Bud was right , after all , " said the girl , after her nervous outbreak . " He told me Mike had some silly hope or other , and I believe Stelton has given you absent treatment until you have made this suggestion . Father , he 's just as preposterous as the others . " " I do n't agree with you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has been for years . He knows the ins and outs of the business , and is willing to take the hard knocks that I 'm getting tired of . Then there 's another thing . I could be half-blind an ' still see what Mike has been wanting these last five years . " Juliet suddenly rose to her feet , all the laughter gone from her eyes and her heart . With a feeling of frightened helplessness she realized that her father was serious . " Are you taking Mike 's part against me ? " she asked calmly . " Well , I still do n't see why you could n't marry him . " " You 've forgotten the mush , father , but that is n't all . There 's something different about Mike lately , something I have never noticed before . His eye seems shifty ; he avoids all the family . If I did n't know him so well , I should think he was a criminal . Leaving out the fact that I do n't love him , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this distrust of him would be enough to block any such arrangements . Why "  --  and her lip curled scornfully  --  " I would marry Bud Larkin a hundred times rather than Mike Stelton once . " " What ! " Bissell rose to his feet with the quiet , amazed exclamation . He could hardly credit his ears . " Marry that dirty sheepman ? " he continued in a tense , even voice . " I 'd like to know what put that crazy notion in yore head . Do n't tell me you are in love with that dude . " " No , I am not , " answered the girl just as evenly , " but I may as well tell you frankly , that he is the only man within a radius of three hundred miles who has certain things I must have in a husband . I 'm sorry if I displease you , father ! " she cried , going to him affectionately , " but I could never love any one not of our class . " That diplomatic " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he saw that the greatest treasure of his whole life had grown beyond him ; that there were needs and ideals in her existence of which he had but the faintest inkling , and that in her way she was as much of a " dude " as the man she had mentioned . He was encountering the seemingly cruel fate of parents who glorify their children by their own immolation , and who watch those same children pass up and out of their humble range of vision and understanding nevermore to return . Henceforth he could never see his daughter without feeling his own lack of polish . Such a moment of realization is bitter on both sides , but especially for the one who has given all and can receive less in return than he had before the giving . The iron of this bitterness entered into Beef Bissell 's soul as he stood there , silent , on the low , rickety veranda under the starlight of the plains . With the queer vagary of a mind at great tension , his senses became particularly acute for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky , smelled the fragrance of the plains borne on the gentle wind , and heard the rustle of the dappled cottonwoods and the howling of the distant coyotes . Then he came back to the reality of the moment , and exhibited the simple greatness that had always been his in dealings with his daughter . He slipped his heavy arm across her shoulders and drew her to him . " Never mind , Prairie Bell , " he said gently . " You know best in everything . Do as your heart dictates . " He sighed and added : " I wish I was your mother to-night . " CHAPTER VIII FOR REVENGE Breakfast next morning at the Bar T ranch was disturbed by the arrival of a cowboy on a lathering , wicked-eyed pony who announced to Stelton that Bud Larkin and his sheep had crossed over into the range . What then occurred is already known , and after Bissell had returned from his final parley with Larkin , he retired sullenly into himself to rage silently . In his perturbed state of mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one meaning , and he took it for granted that Larkin had been awed or frightened into the better part of valor . This was a partial relief , but he foresaw that although this danger to his cattle was averted , it was merely the first of many such struggles that he might expect . Human desires , particularly those of great urgency , are of such domination that they take little thought for anything but themselves , except in persons of particularly adroit mind . It was Stelton 's misfortune , therefore , to embark on an ill-timed conversation with his chief . The foreman for ten years had secretly adored Juliet Bissell with all the intensity of a soul made single of purpose by the vast , brooding immensity of his surroundings . So long as he might be near her , serving her in many little ways , he had been , in a manner , content with the situation . But the sudden appearance of Larkin and the enthusiastic renewal of a former intimacy had spurred Stelton to seek some sort of a definite understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal was shortly followed by Stelton 's appearance there , timorous and abashed . The interview had been short and not very satisfactory . The cowman , remembering with considerable pain the conversation with his daughter , told his employe frankly that he had better give up any such ideas as evidently possessed him . Stelton , who had with some right formerly felt he might count on the favorable attitude of his chief , was astounded , and took the venom of the curt refusal to heart . Retiring without betraying his emotion , he had resolved to speak to the girl herself , and that same afternoon asked permission to accompany her on her daily ride across the prairies , a thing not unusual with him . Juliet , although she wished to be alone , consented , and at four o'clock they set out , unobserved by Bissell . It was not until they had turned their horses homeward that Stelton spoke , almost tongue-tied by the emotions that rent him , alternate waves of fear and hope . " Miss Julie , " he began , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , Mike , you have . " " An ' I allow that I would be plumb miserable if you ever went away from here again . " " Thank you , Mike ; I should miss you , too , " replied the girl civilly , growing uneasy at the unusual trend of the man 's speech , halting and indefinite though it was . " Miss Julie , I ai n't no hand at fine talk , but I want to ask yuh if you will marry me ? I 've thought about it a lot , an ' though I ai n't noways good enough fer yuh , I 'd try to make yuh happy . " Juliet , taken aback by the suddenness of this declaration , particularly after her talk with her father , remained silent . " Take yore time , Miss Julie , " pleaded Stelton , riding closer to her . " I ai n't in no hurry . " " I ca n't tell you how much I appreciate what you 've said , Mike , " she replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always will , but I do n't love you , and I would sooner tell you now than keep you in suspense . I ca n't marry you . " Stelton bit his lip and his dark face grew even blacker with rage at the futility of his position . With anyone other than Juliet Bissell , perhaps , he realized that insistent pressure of his suit might have favorable results . But this cool , calm girl offered no opportunity for argument or hope . " Mebbe if yuh waited a bit , yuh might think different about it , " he ventured nevertheless . She shook her head . " No , Mike , I would n't , I am sure . If you care for me you will never mention this again . And for my part , I shall always remember what you have said to me to-day . It is a sweet thing for a girl to know that a man loves her . " Such gracious refusals are effective with most men , both because they succeed in closing a tender subject and at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the ordinary type of lover . Repressed emotions in somber minds feed and grow fat upon their own substance , and it was inconceivable that Stelton 's genuine though distorted love , an abnormal product of ten long years , should be dismissed thus with a few words . " Why wo n't you marry me ? " he demanded , looking angrily into her level , brown eyes . " I have told you I did not love you . That is the reason and the best reason in the world . Now I ask you to drop the subject . " " Love somebody else , I suppose , " he sneered , baring his teeth in a fatal attempt at an ugly smile . " If I do , it is none of your business , " she replied , her eyes beginning to blaze . " That dude sheepman , I allow . He 's a gilt-edged vanderpoop , he is ! But I 'd hate to be in his boots , if you want to know it . " " Look here , Mike Stelton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop , " either you say nothing more on this subject or I shall tell my father what you have done this afternoon when we reach home . " Instantly the man saw he had gone too far , and , with a quickness born of hatred , immediately changed his front . " I was only thinkin ' of protectin ' you , " he muttered , " and I 'm sorry I was ornery about things . That feller Larkin is a bad lot , that 's all . He would n't be out here if he was n't . " Perhaps it was that Juliet had given a greater place to Larkin in her thoughts than she realized ; perhaps his eloquent defense of wool-growing had not been sufficient explanation for his unheralded appearance on the range . Whatever the reason , the girl rose to the bait like a trout when the ice has left the rivers . " What do you mean by that ? " she demanded . " You remember that feller Caldwell that rode in late to supper the night Larkin come ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him blackmail Larkin for five hundred dollars back by the corral fence . An ' Larkin knew what he had to do as soon as Caldwell showed up . Did n't yuh see him turn yaller at the table ? " As a matter of fact Larkin 's perturbation at that time had been puzzling and inexplicable to Juliet . Also the disappearance of the two men immediately after supper had mystified her . But without admitting this to Stelton she asked : " What was it all about ? " " I do n't know exactly , Miss Julie , but it worked in somethin ' he done back in Chicago a year or so ago . From what I heard ' em say , Larkin just dodged the calaboose . Now there ai n't no disgrace in that  --  that 's really credit  --  but that do n't clear him of the crime noways . Why , I even heard ' em talk about two thousand dollars that Larkin give this Caldwell a couple of years back . " " How did you learn all this ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corral for a rope I left hangin ' on a post there , an ' I heard ' em talkin ' . " " And you listened , I suppose , " remarked Julie contemptuously . " Mebbe I did , " he retorted , stung by her tone . " But you can be thankful for it . I 'd be plenty mad if you throw 'd yourself away on a man like-a-that . A hoss that 'll kill one puncher 'll kill another . Same with a man . " " What are you saying , Mike ? " cried the girl , frightened out of her attitude of aloof reserve . " Kill a man ! He 's never killed a man , has he ? " " He did n't say so in so many words , no ma'am , but that talk o ' their'n was mighty suspicious . " Unwittingly Stelton had struck his hardest blow . To him , as to other rough and ready men in the West , life was a turbulent existence conducted with as few hasty funerals as was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finer feelings of a civilized community , the horror of murder was deep-rooted . She knew that to a man in Larkin 's former position the slightest divergence from the well-defined tenets of right and wrong was inexcusable . Crime , she knew , was a result of poverty , necessity , self-defense or lack of control , and she also knew that Bud Larkin had never been called upon to fall back on any of these . How much of truth , therefore , was there in Stelton 's innuendoes ? " Would you swear on the Bible that you overheard what you have told me ? " she asked suddenly . " Yes , ma'am , I shore would , " Stelton answered with solemn conviction . There was no question now in her mind but that Larkin was paying the piper for some unsavory fling of which she had heard nothing . She did not for a moment believe that the affair could be as serious as Stelton wished her to imagine ; but she was sorely troubled , nevertheless , for she had always cared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since her final coming West she had remembered with a secret tenderness and pride that this wealthy and popular young man had been willing to trust his life to her . It was one of the sweetest recollections of those other far-off days . Now , because the thought of Stelton 's revelations was unbearable to her she resolutely put it from her until a time when she could mourn alone over this shattered illusion . " Thank you , Mike , for telling me this , " she said gently . " Please never say anything further about it . " And Stelton , elated that his plan of revenge had worked so well , smiled with satisfaction and relapsed into silence during the remainder of the ride home . All of these events are set down here with some pretense at detail to indicate the important trend of affairs after Larkin had said a more-or-less indifferent good-by to Juliet Bissell at the fork of Grass Creek . While he was wrestling with material problems , these others that destiny had suddenly joined to him were undergoing mental disturbances in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this unconscious prominence was to be the main reason for what next occurred . It was perhaps noon of the day following Larkin 's capture by the rustlers , when from a point directly east of the ranch house a cowboy appeared , riding at a hard gallop . Contrary to most fictions , cowboys rarely ever urge their ponies beyond a trot , the only occasions being the round-up , the stampede , the drive , or when something serious has occurred . Mike Stelton saw the puncher from a distance and walked to the corral to meet him . Jerking his pony back on his haunches , the rider leaped from his back before the animal had fairly come to a stop . " Mike , we 've been tricked ! " he cried . " That whole two thousand head of sheep are tracking north as fast as they can go far over east on the range , beyond the hills . " " What ! " cried the foreman , hardly able to credit his ears . " The boys down on watch at the Big Horn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to run them north on the range . " " Well , they swore wrong , then , for I 've just come from where I seen ' em . I was over back of them hogbacks and buttes lookin ' for strays and mavericks when along come them muttons in a cloud of dust that would choke a cow . I allow that darned sheepman has made us look like a lot of tenderfeet , Mike . " Stelton at this intelligence fairly gagged on his own fury . Larkin had scored on him again . The two were joined at this moment by Bissell who had noted the excitement at the corral . When apprised of what had happened , the cowman 's face went as dark with anger as that of his foreman . Beef Bissell was not accustomed to the sensation of being outwitted in anything , and the knowledge that the sheep were nearly half-way up the range put him almost beside himself . For a few moments the trio looked at one another speechless . Then Bissell voiced the determination of them all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I wo n't be beaten by any sheepman that ever walked . Stelton , how many men will be in to-night ? " " Fifteen . " " Get ' em and bring ' em to me as soon as they come . " While the foreman went off about this business Bissell learned from Chuck , the cowboy , just where he had seen the sheep last , how fast they were traveling , and how far he calculated they would go before bedding down for the night . " I reckon the outfit ought to camp somewhere about Little Creek , " said Chuck . " That 's runnin ' water . " " And how far beyond that is Little River ? " " Two miles more or less . " " Fine . Wait around till the rest of the boys come in , Chuck . Oh , by the way , how near are the sheep to our eastern herd of cows ? " " Five miles more will bring ' em to the range the cows are on now . " An hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in from riding the range and rounding up strays . Before they were permitted a mouthful , however , Bissell went out to the bunk house with Stelton . " Boys , " he said , " which of you was down at the Big Horn last night an ' turned them sheep back ? " A man spoke up and then two more who had been left on guard in the vicinity . " How many did you scatter ? " " Du n no , boss , " replied the first judicially . " From the noise they made I allow there was at least a thousand . " " Well , I bet you a month 's wage there was n't more'n a hundred , " said Bissell , glaring at the puncher . " Wo n't take yer , boss , " returned the other calmly . " Why ? " " Because practically the whole flock is beddin ' down at Little Creek now . Chuck seen ' em . Now I want all you fellers to get supper an ' then rope an ' saddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be some doin 's to-night . " CHAPTER IX THE MAN IN THE MASK As Bud Larkin jogged along on Pinte , apparently one of the group of men with whom he was riding , he wondered mechanically why his captors insisted on traveling ten miles to a tree sufficiently stout to bear his weight . " I should think they 'd stand me up and do the business with a bullet , " he thought . But a moment 's reflection furnished the answer to this query . These men were cattle-rustlers and horse-thieves , than which no more hazardous existence ever was since the gentle days of West Indian piracy , and to them merely a single pistol shot might mean betrayal of their whereabouts , capture and death . The character of the country through which they rode gave sufficient evidence of their care in all details , for it was a rough , wild , uninhabitable section that boasted , on its craggy heights and rough coulees , barely enough vegetation to support a wild mustang . It was three o'clock of the afternoon and behind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camped . Joe Parker , fearful of stirring about much until the thoughts of range-riders were turning homeward like their ponies ' steps , had delayed the departure beyond the hour first intended . The rustlers really did not want to dispose of Larkin . Being plainsmen , their acute sense of justice told them that this man was absolutely guiltless of any crime deserving of death . Untoward circumstances had forced him into their hands , and , like the boy with the fly-paper , they were unable to get rid of him peaceably . Their abuse of his insane folly was colorful and vivid . But Larkin had reasons for his stubborn attitude . With the arrogance of youth and the inexperience of real danger , he had resolved that as soon as his sheep should be safely up the range he would devote some time , money , and effort to the running down of these rustlers . Some of their faces were unforgetably stamped on his memory now , and he had no doubt that he could be of great service to Wyoming Territory , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had known the losses and insolence of rustlers on his own sheep ranch in Montana , and , like every sympathizer with justice and order , had sworn to himself many times that all of them should be run to earth . The longer Bud remained with the rustlers the more nervous some of them became . Since morning a number had been wearing masks made of their neckerchiefs , and one man had not shown his face since the moment he rode into camp after the all-night drive . This man 's peculiar actions piqued Bud 's curiosity , and he tried a number of times to draw him into conversation . But the rustler refused to speak and moved away whenever he found himself in the prisoner 's vicinity . About five o'clock the cavalcade arrived at a point where , ahead of them , through the barren buttes and hogbacks , they could see the long , level expanse of the range ; and , about half-way to the horizon , a line of trees that indicated the snake-like progress of a river . Here Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie concealed until after dark , as the remainder of their business could then be conducted with less danger to themselves . Accordingly the horsemen turned away from the trail they had been following and after fifteen minutes of tortuous riding , made camp on the other side of a particularly uninviting wall of rock . After eating supper prepared around the little fires Larkin saw the rustlers all gather into a circle and start drawing lots . He shivered a little at the thought that this was his execution party being made up . Four men had been designated as the number to see Larkin off on his long journey , and when at last the drawing was finished it was found that Joe Parker , the masked rider , and two others had been selected . As darkness drew on Parker began to lose his patience with Bud . " Look-a-here , Larkin , " he drawled , " I do n't love no sheepmen , noways , an ' I never did , but you ai n't no ordinary ' walker ' an ' I ai n't ashamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet y'u half-way on this business , an ' you wo n't do it . All you got to say is that you wo n't appear agin any of us in any court , an ' wo n't ever say anythin ' agin any of us . Now what in blazes you 're actin ' like a mule balkin ' at a shadder for , I du n no . Be sensible . " But to all such entreaties Larkin remained unmoved . " If you hang me , " he said , " you 'll only hang yourselves , for all the sheepmen in Wyoming as well as the men from my own ranch will come down here , join with the cattlemen , and clean you fellows out . And if my Basque herders start in on you do n't imagine you will have the luxury of hanging . They 'll take their skinning knives and work from the neck down . No , I 'd advise you to let me go and take your chances rather than kill me and wait . " Such talk as this made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened up the subject of letting Larkin off . But the majority held firm and the sentence stood . It was perhaps eight o'clock when the party of four approached Larkin and roused him up . This time his hands were bound behind his back and he noticed that the masked rustler was fastening them tightly but with a rotten rawhide . This peculiar circumstance caused a wild thrill to flash all through Larkin 's being . Perhaps , after all , here was the weak link in the rustler 's chain . The surmise became a certainty when the man , unobserved by his companions , sawed Bud 's arms back and forth , showing him the quickest and easiest way to work them loose . Then came the greatest surprise of all . The man , who had spoken no word the whole time , thrust a heavy .45 revolver into his trouser-pocket . To permit this being done the eight-inch barrel had been sawed off five inches short , ruining the gun for ordinary use , but making it particularly handy and light for close work . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only willing that he should escape , but was actually determined that the event should occur . He also knew that he could count on the support of this ally in the final moment when the four men must fight it out two and two . Whether this sudden change of aspect was the result of a determination by a minority of the rustlers not to let the execution take place , or whether by some miraculous means one of his own friends had succeeded in joining the organization , he could not determine , although he tried to sound the man in the mask when the others were busy with their horses . His only reply was a low hiss commanding silence . A quarter past the hour found them on their way , the ponies picking their path gingerly over the bad ground until they reached the range . Here the three rustlers drew up short , for in the distance could be seen the twinkling of a camp-fire . " One of the Bar T punchers , " said Joe ; " but I reckon he wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they walked their horses , and then urged them to a trot in the direction of the river whose tree-lined banks they had seen late in the afternoon . They paused only once in this place , and then to cross a small stream that lay in their path . As he rode Larkin worked his arms cautiously back and forth until he felt the rotten rawhide give , and knew that a single violent motion would free him entirely . But he refrained from making that motion , feeling certain that the man in the mask would give the signal when the time was ripe . At last they discerned the loom of the trees against the low northern sky and pulled their horses to a walk , until they arrived directly underneath a big cottonwood , which stood in sinister readiness . " Here 's your last chance , " said Parker in a low voice . " If you swear as we have told you , you can go free now . We take a man 's word out here . " " Never , " replied Larkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shore not , " rejoined the other . " We always grant a man 's last request . Come on , boys , let 's finish this thing quick . " He had hardly spoken when from the distance came the sound of rapid revolver firing , mingled with the wild shouts of men . For a few moments the drama beneath the cottonwood came to an abrupt halt . " By gum ! " cried Joe , " the Bar T punchers have found the boys and there 's the devil to pay back there . Lively , now . " One of the others took his lariat from the throng at the side of his saddle and heaved the coil over an outstretched limb of the cottonwood . He had hardly done so when another sound reached them , a low , menacing rumble that grew momentarily louder until it reached a dull roar . " A stampede ! " bawled one of the men ; " and it 's heading this way . " Joe and the man in the mask still on their horses led Pinte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former reached down to take the noose of the rope from the one who had arranged it . Suddenly Larkin felt a hand fumbling with the rawhide about his arms , and a low voice in his ear whispered : " Now . " With the same motion Bud wrenched his hands free and dug his spurs into the sides of his horse . Pinte , startled , leaped forward just as Larkin drew the revolver from his pocket . Joe , though caught by surprise , did not let go of the bridle that was wound about his right hand , but a blinding shot from the gun of the man in the mask did the work . With a groan Parker pitched forward out of his saddle and fell to the ground just as Larkin fired pointblank at the third man who appeared before him , still on foot . The fellow went down , but not until a yellow stab of light flashed up from where he had been and Bud felt the wind of a bullet as it sped past his cheek . The fourth man was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the man he had rescued were now alone , but their thoughts were fully occupied . The sound of the distant stampede had become a veritable rumbling roar that told of its nearing proximity . Aside from this drumming of many feet , there was no sound , for the animals of the range when in the grip of panic are silent . With glazed eyes and muscles strained to the utmost they thundered into the dark , unconscious and heedless of the sure destruction in their path . It was as though thousands of creatures , with their brains removed , had been turned loose to run at will . " To the river ! " cried the masked man , suddenly panic-stricken , spurring his horse in the direction of the stream . But Larkin was at his heels , and in a moment had seized the other 's bridle and thrown the horse back on his haunches . " No ! " bawled he at the top of his voice . " The bank here is twenty feet high , and at the bottom are rocks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death in the stampede , " yelled the stranger , but Bud would not yield and drew the horse back . " We can divide the herd , " he cried . " Come , we have n't a moment to lose ! " They wheeled as one and dashed out of the brush into the open of the range . The earth was now trembling beneath them and the pounding feet sounded a low , steady note , ominous with warning . Occasionally there was a revolver shot , but this was the only other sound . Straight toward the oncoming living avalanche the two men rode until they had left an open space a hundred yards wide behind them . Then they pulled up short and dismounted . Now out of the threatening thunder sounded a single individual note , the rapid beating of a horse 's feet  --  some horse that was bearing a desperate rider ahead of the stampede but powerless to avoid it . Instantly Larkin saw the picture of the yawning precipice toward which the frantic rider was hurrying at breakneck speed . He raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was instantly acted on , for in another moment a lathering , heaving pony dashed up to them , and the rider leaped to the ground . " Oh , what shall I do ? Hello ! Who are you ? " cried a female voice , and Larkin 's heart leaped as though it had turned over in its place . " Juliet ! " he cried , seizing the girl with one arm and drawing her close . " Bud ! " For an instant she clung to him . " Lead the horses together and shoot them ! " he ordered , although the others could scarcely hear him . Every instant was priceless now , for dimly at the edge of their vision the front wave of the living , leaping tide could be seen . Larkin swung the girl 's horse alongside Pinte , and without a thought or a pang shot them both . They fell one on top of the other . Then the stranger in the mask led his animal in front of the two that had fallen and put a bullet through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barricade . " Got a gun , Julie ? " demanded Bud . " Yes . " " Give it to me and load mine from your belt . " They exchanged weapons and the girl with practiced hand slipped the cartridges into their chambers . The unknown had drawn two guns from some place in his equipment , and now the three peered over their shelter . The advance line of animals was scarcely twenty-five yards away , and , with a clutch of horror at his heart , Bud recognized that they were not cattle as he had supposed , but sheep  --  his own two thousand . In the instant that remained he remembered the shots and shouting of a quarter-hour before , and realized that the animals had been stampeded deliberately . " Let ' er go , " he screamed above the tumult , " and yell like blazes ! " On the word yellow fire streamed out from the four guns and , accompanying it , a perfect bedlam of shrieks and cries . The sheep were now upon them , and the hail of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up against the horses and adding to the barricade . But it could not stop all , and a stream of the animals made its way over the bodies up to the very mouths of the spitting guns . Now others stumbled and fell , to be instantly engulfed by the swirling flood behind ; small , sharp feet were caught between the limbs of the struggling mass that eddied about the dead horses . Still the yellow fire stabbed out into the faces of the middlers  --  for now the leaders were already piling up mangled and dying in the rocky river-bed  --  but , past each side of this island of expiring creatures , thundered a vast , heaving stream , turbulent , silent , irrevocable . The man in the mask with a revolver in each hand was firing steadily , and Larkin , thrilled at the sight of his apparent coolness , turned to look at him . To his amazement he found that the mask had fallen or been snatched away . Again the man fired , and Bud Larkin 's jaw fell as he gazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had saved his life that night . It was Smithy Caldwell . The sheep mind has the power of tenacity , but not that of change . There was scarcely a shot left in the guns , and still the fear-blinded animals battered at the growing wall of dead and dying that divided them . But at last they began to push to each side , and gradually the idea of splitting took full hold . Then the prisoners behind the dead horses sank down in almost hysterical relief , for there was no danger that any more would attempt to mount the barricade . In fact , had the obstacle to their progress been suddenly removed , the stampeded herds would have continued to split for an indefinite period . Now , listening , Larkin could hear the crash of the animals through the underbrush and the horrid , sickening sounds of the writhing , half-dead mass in the river-bed as more and more , following their predecessors blindly , took the leap . At last the stream on each side thinned , the rumbling thunder of pounding feet grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving behind it a sudden , deathly silence . In the distance a faint murmur was heard , and Larkin found later that this was made by the two or three hundred which escaped death in the river . As a matter of fact , the great number of the animals had filled the narrow gully , and the last few charged across the bodies of their fallen comrades to solid ground and safety beyond . Now that the danger had passed , Larkin felt a certain miserable nausea in the pit of his stomach , and fought it down with all his might . Caldwell was not so successful , however , and stumbled from the shelter and his companions , furiously sick . Juliet began to weep softly , the tears of nervous reaction coming freely when neither pain nor fear could have brought them . Bud passed his arm gently about her shoulders , and patted her with soft encouragement and praise for her bravery . Nor did the girl resent his action . Rather it seemed to steady her , and after a few minutes she looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny for that other man to get seasick out here where we ca n't get enough water to drink ? " she asked , with a sudden tangent of humor that made Bud laugh uproariously , and seemed to relieve the strain that oppressed them . " Brave little girl ! " he said , getting up . " That reminds me . I wonder where our friend is ? " He walked out in the direction Caldwell had taken and expected to find the other recovering from his attack . But he could see or hear nothing to indicate that the man was within a dozen miles . He called , and his voice sounded puny and hollow against the vastness of the sky . He heard no hails in answer , except the long , shrill one which the coyotes gave from a neighboring rise of ground . Smithy Caldwell had disappeared . Larkin returned to Juliet Bissell perplexed , mystified , and disturbed . What possible reason could there be for the quixotic actions of the man he hated more than any other in the world ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among a band of desperate rustlers ? How and why ? Caldwell presented so many variations on those two themes that Larkin 's head fairly swam , and he turned gladly to relieve the situation in which Juliet Bissell now found herself . CHAPTER X WAR WITHOUT QUARTER He found her where he had left her , but now she was standing and looking out over the silent prairies , as though searching for someone . " What are you trying to see ? " Bud asked . " I thought father and some of the cowboys would probably follow the sheep once they had started them . Oh , what have I said ? " " I imagined it was they who had done it , " said Bud quietly , the full enormity of the thing not yet having sunk deep into his mind . " How did you get mixed up in it ? " " Simply enough , " replied Julie . " Late in the afternoon Chuck , one of the men on the eastern range , came riding in and said that your sheep were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stelton talked a lot about it at supper , and figured up then that the easiest way  --  well , to teach you a lesson , they called it  --  was to run them over the bank of the Little River . " I do n't like sheep , Bud , as you know ; but that was going too far for me , and I protested , with the result that father took Mike outside with him , quite upset that I said anything at all . Both of them looked black as a silk hat . " " Good little girl ! " cried Bud gratefully , and she turned her face directly toward him and smiled ; just such a smile , Larkin remembered , as he had seen her use on other soft nights years before , in circumstances so totally different . " After supper , " she continued , " there was a great bustle of getting away , and I grew curious to see what they would do and how . So as soon as they left I saddled my calico and set out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles to the north . The next thing I heard was a terrific lot of shooting and yelling , and the business was done . I do n't wonder the sheep were in a panic ! " Then I heard the sound of the stampede , but I did not realize it was driving straight at me . I must have been confused in my idea of where the Little River was . Anyway , before I had time to think about it I realized I was directly in their path and with a very small advantage . I could escape neither to right nor left , for the wings of the running flock were wide , and all I could do was to run my pony as hard as he could go . " He seemed to know the danger ; all cow ponies do , I guess , for I never saw him travel like that in all my life ; he stretched so flat along the ground that it almost seemed as though I could reach down and touch it with my hand . You know what such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ankle-breakers ! Well , we took the chance , and Billy actually drew away from the sheep , panicky as they were . " But I could n't gain enough to dare to turn to right or left , and I had just about given up hope because the trees were ahead , when I saw the flash and heard the report of your gun . Thank God it was you , Bud . I 've never known you to be a coward or to fail in any situation . I ca n't say how grateful I am for what you have done to-night . " " I assure you I did n't do it , Julie ; it was that man who got sick and left us . He 's disappeared now . " " Who was he ? One of the Bar T punchers ? " " No , it was that fellow , Caldwell . Perhaps you do n't remember him  --  he came to the Bar T for supper the same night I did . " " Yes , I remember him , " said Julie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone . Suddenly in this strange situation she found herself face to face with another chapter in the mystery that baffled her . " Well , he saved my life to-night , and , though I ca n't say I admire the fellow very much , I am mighty grateful to him . " " It is strange you two should be together out here when your sheep were somewhere else , " hazarded Juliet , looking full at Larkin and expecting some action or word to betray his fear of her suspicions . " Not at all strange when you know the circumstances , " he replied . " Just listen to this tale of adventure . But first I think we had better start walking toward the Bar T ranch house . We ought to meet some of the cowboys . Br-r  --  it 's cold ! " and Bud shivered in the piercing chill of the spring night . To the plainsman walking is the most refined form of punishment . Your real cowboy slouches miserably along in his tight-fitting , uncomfortable high-heeled boots , looking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In cowboy parlance his " feet do n't track , " his backbone wilts , and his knees bow naturally as a result of early horseback riding . On solid earth the cowboy is a crestfallen and dejected object . As the two trudged along beneath the calm stars that had seen a thousand stampedes since the millions of buffalo roared up and down its length , Larkin told Juliet of the events that had occurred since they had said farewell at the fork of Grassy Creek . At the mention of the rustlers and the activities they were carrying on the girl gave a little , low cry . " Father must hear that , " she said . " He would give a lot to have descriptions of those men . " " He could n't give me back two thousand sheep and lambs , " rejoined Bud bitterly . " No , but I think he would give you their value . " " Yes , and stampede it into another gully when I brought it across his range . Juliet , I 'm not done with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man that ever heard a calf bawl for milk , until I get my rights on the free range . " Larkin 's voice was deep and full-throated with the righteous anger that surged through him over the outrage that had been wrought that night . As for the girl , she did not recognize this Bud Larkin . The man she had known had been one of gay pleasantries , but rather ineffectual endeavors ; this man who spoke was one to whom his will was his law , and obstacles merely helps because of their strengthening of his determination . For the first time she saw the Bud Larkin that had developed in the last year , and a kind of admiring thrill at the mental stature of the man went through her . And yet she knew that war  --  hard , tenacious , ugly war  --  war without quarter , mercy , or respite , was irrevocably declared between Larkin and her father ; and , even in her instinctive loyalty to her house , she had to admit that Bud was justified . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said plaintively . " It will only result in ruin to everybody . " Larkin laughed harshly . " I 'll never give it up until I am either dead or have n't a dollar left , " he replied . " I am determined to have my rights in this matter , and I shall have them whatever the cost . " For a time there was silence between them , each realizing that further discussion could only prove unhappy . They had gone about two miles from the scene of the stampede when suddenly a man appeared close in front of them and commanded them to halt . " Hello , Sims ! " cried Larkin joyfully , recognizing the other 's voice , but at the same time hoisting his hands above his head . " Well , chief , " said the herder imperturbably , returning his revolver to its holster , " I allow your vacation has cost you a lot of money . " Bud then outlined his experiences briefly , concluding with his story of the stampede , and Sims whistled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , what 's the story now ? " Bud asked . Juliet had walked ahead when the two men met , and now Larkin dropped far enough behind to be out of ear-shot and yet keep the girl dimly in sight . Hurriedly , for him , Sims related the story of the ill-fated expedition up to the time of the stampede . He and the herders had put up what defense they could , he said , and , as a result , two of his men were dead and the others scattered . However , he expected they would return to the now deserted camp . " I want you to take them back south to the Badwater River , " ordered Larkin . " The second flock ought to be there by this time , but I want you to hold them there . In two days the boys from Montana ought to be down , and when you 're ready to start north you will have force enough to fight any bunch of cowboys old Bissell can scrape together . " " But if we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come and pile up there , and then we shore will have our hands full . " " All right , let ' em pile up . We 'll get ' em through just the same . Now , Sims , we are in this thing for blood from now on , and do n't you forget it for a minute . " " Trust me , boss , " drawled the herder . " Are you comin ' down to join us ? " " Yes , if I can . As soon as I get Miss Bissell into safe hands I 'll come . But do n't count on me ; I may never get there . Do whatever you think best , but bring those sheep through . And tell the herders and the boys from the north that while this trouble is on I 'll pay them five dollars a day apiece . " " Shore , they 'd rassle the devil himself for that , " commented Sims . " And you get ten , " supplemented Larkin . " Now go ahead and make all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hands . " Sims faded from sight noiselessly , and Larkin hurried forward to overtake Juliet . They had not been together five minutes when the rapid trotting of horses was heard ahead and Larkin , taking the chance of falling into evil hands , called out to the travelers . " Who 's there ? " came a gruff voice , accompanied by the click of hammers drawn back . " Oh , father , it 's I  --  Juliet ! " cried the girl , recognizing the speaker and running toward him . There was a surprised exclamation out of the darkness , and the sound of a man vaulting from the saddle . The next moment and he had clasped his daughter in his arms . Larkin , his mission completed , started to back away from the scene , but the girl herself wrecked this intention . " It was Mr. Larkin who called out , " she said , evidently in answer to a question . " He saved my life , father , and he has brought me safely back . He is standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran , but the sound of a pony closing in on him brought him to a stop . " Well , what do you want ? " he demanded angrily . " Bissell wants to see you , " said the rider whose voice the sheepman recognized as that of Stelton . Not deigning to enter an argument with the foreman , Bud walked back to where Bissell stood beside his horse . " Now the sheep are out of the way , if you want to learn anything about rustlers I guess our friend here can tell you , " remarked Stelton suddenly , in a voice exultant as it was ugly . " Oh , yes , father , " added Juliet , " he 's been with them for almost two days . " " Is this so , Mr. Larkin ? " asked Bissell . " Yes . " " Well , we wo n't discuss it now , " said the cowman . " Let 's go back to the ranch house and get something to eat . I have an extra horse here , Larkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't care to , thanks , " answered Bud dryly . " Since you have ruined me , you will do me a favor by letting me go . " " I allow I 'd like to do you a favor , " rejoined Bissell with equal courtesy , " but I 've got to find out about them rustlers . We wo n't keep yuh long . " " Come on , get up on that horse , " said the voice of Stelton close beside him , and Bud turned to look into the long barrel of the foreman 's gun that was stuck under his nose . Trembling with suppressed fury , he did as he was told , but on the ten-mile ride to the Bar T ranch said nothing , and only revolved in his mind one question : How did Stelton know he had been with the rustlers before Julie had said anything about them ? CHAPTER XI MADE PRISONER At three o'clock the next afternoon Beef Bissell felt better than he had for some time , this condition being a result of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that young man was in his hands . He felt that the back of the sheep business had been broken as far as his range and his county were concerned . I have put the opening of this chapter at three o'clock , because that was the hour at which life began to be manifest at the Bar T ranch after the stirring events of the night before . Bud Larkin himself , worn out with his nights and days of vigil , had gone to sleep on his bed almost in the act of taking his boots off . Vague ideas of escape had coursed through his mind only to be overtaken and killed by the slumber he had evaded for so long . His window faced southwest , and when he awoke it was to find the dazzling gold of the sun warming his face . For a moment he did not realize where he was , staring thus into the blinding radiance ; but memory is only a few seconds sleepier than its master , and shortly everything came back to him . A sinking sensation came over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more because of the helpless agony of the poor dumb brutes than because of the monetary loss , although the latter was no trifling consideration , since nearly eight thousand dollars had been wiped out in less than half an hour . Added to this sickening sensation was one of dull , choking rage that Bissell , a man of wealth and certain prominence in the State , should suggest and pursue a course that the most despised sheep-herder would never countenance . That , Larkin told himself , showed the real man ; the rough , crude product of a rough and bitter country . For the slogan of the earlier West was selfishness . " All this is mine and do n't you come a-nigh me ! " bawled the cowman when the nesters or grangers began to make their appearance . The cowboy himself was the chief exponent of this philosophy . Restraint was unknown to him  --  his will was his law , and he tried to make it everyone else 's . When thousands of men have the same idea the result is trouble ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artillery . The one person for whom the cow-puncher had no respect and for whom the cow country was no fit abiding place was the man who allowed himself to be domineered . For that man convict-labor on a coral road would have been paradise compared to his ordinary existence . Thus was the West the supreme abode at that time of the selfists or anarchists who have no thought or consideration outside their own narrow motives and desires . Though Bud Larkin could not have analyzed his feelings in words , perhaps , yet he felt this keenly , and knew that now or never must he take his stand and keep it . He labored under the double handicap , in this country , of having gone in for sheep and having been beaten at it the very first thing . Consequently , if he ever expected to gain any caste , or at least a hearing , he must turn the tables and that as soon as possible . At the present moment , as he washed his face in the thick white wash-bowl that made the guest-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had nothing but the remotest ideas of how this might be done . The fact , in brief , was that his sheep were and would continue piling up in the hills north of the Badwater , ready to enter the hazardous stretch of dry territory that had so nearly been disastrous to his first flock . Until he should be free and could reconnoiter his chances and resources he would hesitate to order them sent north . And yet they could not stay forever near the Badwater . Neither could they be halted on their march north , because they were crossing the range of Wyoming sheepmen at the time and common plains courtesy demanded that they be removed as fast as possible . But for the fact that Sims was in personal charge Bud Larkin would have been in utter despair . Such was his confidence in his indolent herdsman that he felt that though ultimate failure attended their efforts no blame could ever be attached to Sims . Leaving the guest-chamber , Larkin immediately stepped into the dining-room and the gloomy thoughts fled , for there sat Juliet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smile and immediately rose . " Well , Mr. Man , I thought you would never wake up , " she remarked in mock reproof . " I 've been waiting here since dinner to see that you had something to eat when you came out . You must be wild hungry . " " I could eat a saddle , " said Larkin . " Sorry , but the saddles are all out , " she replied with a smile . " However , we have some nice fresh broiled quirts , garnished with rawhide . " " Bring me a double order , " said Bud , laughing , as he seated himself . When he was almost through with his meal Juliet remarked : " Father asked me to say that he would like to have a talk with you on the veranda when you were ready . " " I 'll go right out , " he answered , thanking her for the trouble she had taken . He found Bissell seated in one of the big chairs outside , and took the other . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I owe you a great deal , Larkin , for saving my daughter last night , " he said with genuine emotion in his voice . " Under the circumstances I am sorry for what I did , and wish I had it to do over again . " " As for the first , I do n't deserve much credit . Juliet really saved her own life by coming to us when I fired the warning shot . As to the sheep , it 's too late to think about them now ; we 'll come to another reckoning in that matter later on . I 'd hardly expect a horse-thief to do a trick like that . " Bissell 's tanned face turned a deep mahogany hue under the sting of this remark , and his eyes lost the soft look they had held when he spoke of Juliet . " I 'm willing to pay yuh the money loss , " he replied , still anxious to make amends . " On guarantee , I suppose , that I do n't try to bring the rest of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's impossible , as you might know . " " I allow you 're right foolish , Mr. Larkin ; better think it over . " " I did that last night when the sheep went into the river , " said Bud dryly . " I suppose so , but a night 's sleep sometimes changes a man 's mind . " " Not mine . The first night I was here I told you that I would bring my sheep north , and I still intend to do it . I am always willing to meet a man half-way ; but you would n't meet me . Instead of that you started in to ruin me . I have no objection to that , but you 'd better take care that your schemes do n't work two ways . " Bissell shrugged his shoulders . He still had the upper-hand of the situation , and his temper , in that case , was not hard to control . " I allow I can look out for myself , " he said . " No doubt , but you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I reckon I 'll manage , " remarked Bissell contemptuously . " But all this is n't what I wanted to ask you . I 'd be some pleased if you 'd tell me about them rustlers you were with . " " Why do you want to know about them ? " countered Bud . " Because they 're ruinin ' the cattle business . I du n no how many head they run off last year , but I do know that profits were cut in half by ' em . You was with ' em long enough to know some of ' em again , I allow ? " " Yes . I would know nearly all of them . What 's left of three is out there near the cottonwoods along Little River , but I do n't believe there 's enough to bury . " " How is that ? " inquired Bissell , who had evidently not heard of Larkin 's narrow escape from death at the rustler 's hands . Bud told him briefly . " You shore were lucky , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation . " Now , I 'm the head of the cattlemen 's association in this part of the State , and o ' course it 's our business to clear the country of those devils . You 're just the man we want , because you 've seen ' em and know who they are . You tell me what yuh know and there 'll be the biggest hangin ' bee this State ever seen . " As has been said , Bud Larkin had the legitimate owner 's hatred of these thieves who preyed on the work of honest men , and had sworn to help run them out of the country as soon as his own business was finished . Now , in the flash of an eye he saw where he could turn the knowledge he had gained to good account . " You have rather queer ideas of me , Mr. Bissell , " he said . " First , you fight me until I am nearly ruined , then you expect I will turn around and help you just as though nothing had happened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " you 've got to help us . This is all outside of a war between the cows and the sheep . This is a matter of right and justice . " " So is the matter of my sheep . The range is free and you wo n't let me use it . Do you call that right or just , either one ? " Bissell choked on his own reply , and grew red with anger . Suddenly , without exactly knowing how , the tables had been turned on him . Now , instead of being the mighty baron with the high hand , he was the seeker for help , and this despised sheepman held the trump cards . Furthermore , Larkin 's direct question was capable of a damaging reply . Bissell sought desperately for a means of escape from the trap in which he found himself . " Do you mean , young feller , that you wo n't tell me about them rustlers ? " " That 's about it . But I might on one condition . " " What 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of my sheep undisturbed passage north across the range to Montana . " " By gosh ! " yelled the cowman , beside himself , springing out of his chair and glaring at the other with clenched hands on his hips . " That 's your game , is it ? Yuh pull our teeth an ' then offer us grub , eh ? Why , tan my hide  --  " he gagged with wrath and stood speechless , a picture of impotent fury . Larkin laughed quietly . " The shoe 's on the other foot , but it does n't seem to feel any too good , " he sneered . " Better be reasonable now , had n't you ? " " Reasonable ? Sure , I 'll be reasonable ! " cried the other vindictively , almost suffocated with his emotion . " Let me ask yuh something . Do you absolutely refuse to tell about them rustlers if I do n't do as you want and let your sheep through ? " " Well , not exactly , " replied Bud , grinning . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run off a hundred head or so of your stock yet this week for the railroad camps up the State . I think it 's fair to give you warning beforehand . " " Darn you and your warning ! What I want is the names and descriptions of them men . Will yuh give ' em to me ? " " No , not unless we can strike a bargain . You talk about right and justice . Now let 's see a little of it , " answered Larkin . " All right , young feller , you 've said your say . Now listen to me . I 'm a deputy sheriff in this county "  --  he ripped open his vest and showed the badge pinned to the inside lining  --  " an ' I hereby arrest yuh for bein ' a party to them rustlers . Yer either a criminal or yuh ai n't , accordin ' to our notions out here , an ' if yuh wu n't help us catch yer friends there ai n't nothin ' more to be said . Now roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yuh want to . " He glared defiantly down on Larkin , whose brows had drawn together as he went into executive session with himself . In five seconds the situation between these men was once more reversed . It was not that Larkin had overreached himself ; he simply had encountered a circumstance of which he was unaware . The possibility of Bissell being a deputy sheriff had never occurred to him , and now he sat balked and perplexed , balancing his chances on either hand . It was not in the man to yield supinely to this new danger . He could not even think of the possibility without shame . He was right , he told himself over and over again , and , listen as he would , he could detect no contradictory reply from the still , small voice we are all credited with possessing . His mission in life was to get his sheep through . In that circumstance the rustlers were unexpected allies and he hoped they would put burs under the tails of every steer on the range and drive them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were safe across the line Bud would gladly return and help round them up . The idea that he , clipped , helpless , and harmless as he was , should now turn in and assist his despoilers to better their own fortunes was so maddening that he grinned with fury as he thought of it . No , the thing was impossible ! Bissell had not changed his menacing position during all of Bud Larkin 's ponderings and was waiting patiently for some outbreak from his victim . But at last he could stand it no more . " Well , " he snarled , " say something ! What 's your answer ? " " That bargain goes as she stands , " said Bud , after a moment 's thought . " You help me and I 'll help you . Otherwise you wo n't get a word out of me , and you can do whatever you like . " " You 're under arrest , " snapped Bissell . " Give me your gun ! " and he covered Bud with a single swift motion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose . " Now go into that room ; you 're a prisoner , " ordered Bissell . CHAPTER XII JULIET ASSERTS HERSELF Now that the owner of the Bar T ranch had succeeded again in a match of wits with Larkin , he put sheep out of his mind and turned his attention to the more-immediate danger of rustlers . It had been a matter of a couple of years since the last determined attempt of the cowmen to oust these poachers by force of arms , and Bissell thought that the time was ripe for another and , if possible , final expedition . With Larkin in his power , he had no doubt that the necessary information could be procured from him in one way or another , and , after talking matters over with Stelton , dispatched cowboys at top speed to the ranches in his district , asking that the owners and as many men as they could spare should come at once to a conference at the Bar T. Having got them there , it was his intention to sweat Larkin for names and descriptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse all information , then his case could be acted upon by the members of the association without any further delay . All these plans Larkin learned from Juliet and her mother , who looked after most of his wants . The latter , good woman , quite flustered at having what she termed a " regular boarder , " became rather fond of the patient young man from the East who never failed to listen attentively to her narrative of the famous trip to St. Paul . The regular boarder , for his part , could not but sympathize with this homely , hard-working , lonely woman . One rarely connected Martha Bissell with old Beef Bissell except in an impersonal way , as one would have connected the corral , or the barn , or the brand . In fact , the cowman seemed hardly cognizant of her existence , long since having transferred all the affections his hard life had left him to the daughter he worshiped . But Martha , as is so often the case with women who grow old slaving for their husbands , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day they had eloped on one horse and been married by a " sky pilot " in the nearest cow town . Mrs. Bissell had come to that dolorous time in a woman 's life when she no longer has the power of attracting male attention  --  which power is not a matter of age , but merely of mind and spirit . And yet there were depths in her , Larkin found , unsuspected because unsought . Loving her daughter as she loved her husband , she derived a certain negative happiness from the fact that their exclusive companionship brought them pleasure . For herself she asked nothing , and , as is the way of the world , she got it . For Bud Larkin , who had only known her as an angular , uninteresting addendum of the Bar T , she took on a certain pathetic interest , and he went out of his way to talk with her about the glories of Chicago , since her one dissipation seemed to be mental journeys back East . Larkin was not strictly a prisoner at the Bar T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of standpoints . He had the run of the ranch , an old , decrepit cow pony to ride , and could go in any direction he chose under the supervision of a cowboy who carried a Winchester and was known to have impaled flies on cactus spines at thirty yards . Occasionally Bud and Juliet rode out together , with this man in the rear , and renewed the old friendship that had lain dormant for so long . During one of these rides the girl , after debating the matter with herself , opened on a delicate subject . " That Caldwell man is a strange-looking fellow , Bud . Who is he ? " Larkin looked at Juliet closely before replying , but could find nothing in her face to indicate any but a natural curiosity . " He is a Chicago character I used to know , " he returned shortly . " But what brought him out here is a puzzle to me . " " You seemed to want to see him pretty badly , " said she , assuming a pout . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way he did that first night you came . " " That 's the first time I have been flattered with your jealousy , " Bud returned gayly . " I 'll ask him to come again . " And that was the closest she could come to a discussion of Caldwell 's connection with Larkin . The fact , although she would not admit it , gave her more concern than it should have , and kept her constantly under a cloud of uneasiness . Bud 's evasion of the subject added strength to the fear that there was really something horrible in Bud 's past . It was on one of his rides alone that Bud suddenly came to a very unflattering solution of another problem in regard to Caldwell . Ever since the stampede he had been giving time to the consideration of Smithy 's strange actions that night . There was no love lost between the two , that was certain , and why the blackmailer should risk his life to defeat the rustlers and save the man he hated was beyond Bud 's comprehension . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his doubts , and this was that Smithy Caldwell had saved him for the same reason that the old lady in the fairy story was told to preserve the goose . " Kill the goose and there will be no more golden eggs , " remarked the fairy sagely , and evidently Caldwell was ready to heed her advice . It certainly was worth the effort on Smithy 's part , and even when Larkin had finally discovered the man 's sordid motives he felt a species of admiration for the man 's coolness and bravery . He felt , too , that , if he could not get a grip on the blackmailer before another payment was demanded , he could part with the money for the first time with the feeling that Caldwell had partially earned it . As to Caldwell 's presence among the rustlers , that was another matter entirely , and Larkin could not fathom the mystery . How Smithy , a low Chicago tough , whose only knowledge of a horse had been gained by observation , could so quickly become a trusted member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was there some occult power about the man  --  some almost hypnotic influence that passed his crossed eyes and narrow features in that company ? Larkin gave it up . But he knew that , should he ever again get his full liberty , his sheep safely across the range , and the leisure to pursue rustlers , Mr. Smithy Caldwell of Chicago would be his especial prey . And he grinned with anticipation at the glory of that moment when he should have the blackmailer in his power with enough evidence to swing him . Stelton was the one man of the whole Bar T outfit who had suffered from the boomerang of his evil plans . It had been through him that Larkin was forced to accompany Bissell home after the stampede ; and now he passed days and nights of misery , watching the progress of Bud 's very evident suit . Chained down by his daily round of duties , his time was not his own , and with a green venom eating at his heart he watched the unfettered Bud ride off across the plains with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So greatly did this irk Mr. Stelton that his morose melancholy increased to a point where his own cowpunchers entertained fears for his sanity , and made him acquainted with the fact in their well-known tender manner . This did not serve to buoy his spirits , and he cursed himself roundly for the ridiculous position into which he had led himself . As to Juliet , he hardly dared pass a civil time of day with her , so terrible a trial had his thwarted desires in regard to her become . The fourth day after Bud 's arrest old Beef Bissell called for his horse and rode away to the Circle Arrow ranch . Old man Speaker had not seen fit to rally to the cowmen 's gathering , and Bissell valued his counsel very much ; he had , therefore , gone to fetch him . During the three days of his absence Mike Stelton suffered another of those reverses which are so exasperating because they are brought about by our own ugly spirits . All the time he had continued to eat at the ranch table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention . Now , with old Bissell out of the way , his status immediately changed . Mrs. Bissell , Juliet , and Bud were the best of friends , and presented a solid front of uniform but uninterested politeness to the foreman against which he was helpless . On the second day , for the first time in ten years , he moved his seat down into the punchers ' dining-room and ate with them . Such a defeat as this could not pass unnoticed among the punchers , who had never been accorded the pleasure of their gloomy foreman 's presence at meal times , and Stelton suffered keenly from the gibes of the men . Stelton endured all this with seeming calmness , but when Bissell returned the foreman got his revenge . He outlined with full detail and considerable embellishment the constant progress that Larkin was making with Juliet . Disclaiming any interest of his own in the matter , he explained that the reason for his complaint was the character of Larkin . " Why , boss , yuh shore would n't want a darned sheepman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " an ' him a Eastern dude at that . You should ' a ' seen that feller . Yuh no more'n got yore back turned than he carried on with Juliet all the time . It made me plenty mad , too ; but what could I do about it ? I just moved my grub-pile down with the boys an ' thought I 'd tell yuh when yuh came home . " A half an hour of this was sufficient to work Bissell up into a furious rage , and , in something the same temper , he sent for Juliet an hour before dinner . Now , a man who is subjected to choleric outbursts should never send for anything but food an hour before dinner , for the reason that a very trivial thing looks , at that time , big enough to wreck the nation . Bissell , however , failed to recollect this simple truth , and greeted his daughter with smoldering eyes , that gradually softened , however , the longer he looked at her . " There is somethin ' I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yuh wo n't mind ? " " No , dear , " she answered . " What is it ? " " This sheepman Larkin  --  is it true yuh been courtin ' with him while I been away ? " " I 've been riding with him a good deal , and I 've seen him every day , if that is what you mean . You trust me to be sensible , do n't you , father ? " " Yes , Julie , o ' course I do ; but I 'm just thinkin ' of yerself  --  and of me . Du n no what people 'd say if they knowed ol ' Bissell 's daughter was traipsin ' around with a sheepman that stands in with the rustlers . An ' you  --  I allow it 'd break my heart if yuh ever got fond of that rascal . He 's a bad lot . " " I ca n't agree with you in any of those things , " said the girl , with just the right mixture of determination and affection in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no disgrace to be a sheepman ; Mr. Larkin is not in with the rustlers , as I believe he outlined to you , nor is he a rascal in any way . Lastly , I do n't care what people say about whom I ride with . Mr. Larkin is a gentleman , and that is all I require . " During this speech , which held the middle ground between daring and prudence , independence and acquiescence , civility and impertinence , Bissell 's jaw dropped and his eyes opened . He had rarely , if ever , known his daughter to make such an explicit refutal of his inferences . His brow darkened . " Yuh never stuck up fer a man like that in yore life , Julie , " he accused her severely . " That Larkin is a bad one . Mebbe yuh do n't know it , but he ca n't answer for everything in his life . O ' course , you ca n't understand these things , but I 'm just tellin ' yuh . Now , I 'm plumb sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell me yuh wo n't go out with him any more . " " I do n't think you should ask me that , father , " said the girl quietly . " I am old enough to choose my own associates . I have known Mr. Larkin for years , where you have only known him for days . I love you too much to disgrace you or mother , daddy dear ; but you must not ask me to act like a fifteen-year-old schoolgirl . " To Bissell , after dinner , this talk would have served its intended purpose  --  that of presenting reasonably the reverse side of the argument . Now , however , it merely stirred him up . He looked sharply at his daughter with his small , piercing eyes . " Do you defy me ? " he thundered , amazed at the girl 's temerity . " All I do is try to think up ways of makin ' yuh happy , an ' now yuh insist on havin ' this scoundrel make love to yuh , whether I want it or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love with him ? " " I 've never met another man I cared as much for , " she returned with calm frankness , looking at him with big , unafraid brown eyes . " Great Heavens ! " cried Bissell , leaping out of his chair and raising his clenched fists above his head . " That I should come to this ! Julie , do yuh know what yore sayin ' ? Do yuh know what yore doin ' ? " " Yes , I do ; and do you want to know the reason for it ? " " Yes . " " Because I think the things that have been done to Mr. Larkin are contemptible and mean . " There was no placidity in those brown eyes now . They flashed fire . Her face had grown pale , and she , too , had risen to her feet . " I 'm a cowman 's daughter , but still I can be reasonable . Our range is free range , and he has a perfect right to walk his sheep north if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no excuse for the stampede that took place the other night . " And last of all , you have no right to keep Mr. Larkin here against his will so that he does not know what is happening to the rest of his flocks . I consider the whole thing a hideous outrage . But that is n't all . You have talked to me this afternoon in a suspicious manner that you have no right to use toward me . I am not a child , and shall think and act for myself . " " What do you mean by that ? That you will help this scoundrel ? " " Yes , if I think it is the right thing to do . " Bissell started back as though someone had struck him . Then he seemed to lose his strength and to shrivel up , consumed by the flame of his bitterness and disappointment . At the sight , the girl 's whole heart melted toward the unhappy man , and she longed to throw her arms around him and plead for forgiveness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was , in his hard environment , was dominant in her , and she stood her ground . For a minute Bissell looked at her out of dull , hurt eyes . Then he motioned toward the door . " Go in , " he said gently ; " I do n't want to see yuh . " CHAPTER XIII THE HEATHEN CHINEE Hard-winter Sims , lying at full length on the grass , indulging in another of his frequent siestas , was rudely awakened by one of his herders . " More sheep they come , " said the man . " Great Michaeljohn ! " swore Sims , heaving his long length erect . " More ? " " Yes ; it is Rubino with the third flock . " Sims cast a practiced eye over the sides of the swelling hills , where already two thousand animals , the second consignment , were feeding . It was now a week since he had met Bud Larkin after the stampede , and he was worried over the non-appearance of his chief . Here , in the hills of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fed the second flock up one valley and down the next , waiting for Larkin 's arrival or some word from him . Hurrying south after that midnight meeting , he had reached his destination just in time to check the advance of the second two thousand that had come the night before . Knowing the hard march north , but ignorant of the conditions now prevailing on the Bar T range , he had hesitated to expose more of Larkin 's animals to ruin . The arrival of this third flock complicated matters in the extreme , since the feeding-ground became constantly farther away from the original rendezvous . He looked in the direction indicated by the herder and saw the cloud of dust that betokened the advance of the new flock . Soon the tinkle of the bells and the blethering of the animals themselves reached him , and he started leisurely back to meet Rubino . He found the sheep in good physical shape , for they had been traveling at a natural pace , a condition not always easily brought about , and totally dependent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men follow constantly behind the animals , they , feeling that they are being constantly urged , will go faster and faster , neglecting to crop , and so starve on their feet in the midst of abundant feed . For this reason herders often walk slowly ahead of their flock , holding them back . " Where are the next two thousand ? " Sims asked Rubino . " Two days behind , and coming slowly . " " And the last ? " " Three days behind them , but farther to the east . " Sims whistled . He realized that in five days , if nothing were done , he would have eight thousand sheep on his hands , scattered over the hills in every direction and subject to heavy loss both by wild animals and straying . With the aplomb of a general disposing his forces , Sims indicated the rising hill on which Rubino should bed his flock down , and watched critically as they went through this evolution . Sheep are the most unresponsive to human affection of any domesticated animal . Never , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they come to recognize man as an integer . They still cling to the flock life . Even when attacked by wild animals at night they do not seek the shepherd , but stand and bawl to the valiant ( ? ) rams to beat off the enemy . On the march , the dogs do the actual herding , so that the " muttons " do not look to man for their orders . The only occasion that they appeal to a human being is when their bodies crave salt . Then they run to him with a peculiar guttural cry , and , having been supplied , forget the herder immediately . Some people have tried to prove that this trait predicates a recognition of the human being as such , but it seems far more likely that they regard him with the same indifference as a giver that they do the water-hole which quenches their thirst . Without intelligence , or the direct appreciation of man , they are entirely unattractive , ranking far below the dog , horse , or even cow . Consequently but few men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of these few , Hard-winter Sims was probably the leader . Something closely akin to a maternal obligation was constantly at work in him , and the one thing that brought instant response was the cry of distress of a lamb or ewe . Now , as Rubino 's flock dotted itself over the hillside in the sunset , Sims watched what was to him the most beautiful thing in the world . The sounds were several  --  the mothering mutter of the ewes , the sharp blat of some lamb skipping for dinner , the plaintive cries of the " grannies "  --  wethers who , through some perverted maternal instinct , seek to mother some stray lamb as their own  --  and the deeper , contented throating of the rams . The dogs , panting and thirsty with the long day 's march , saw that their charges were finally settled , except for the few lone sentinels against the cobalt sky . Then they trotted with lolling tongues to the little stream that trickled down the valley and waded in to drink . After that they sought out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering why no preparations for supper were going forward . To the herders after the long trail the luxury of a cook wagon was appreciated . Only the first and last detachments carried one , and Rubino 's men had cooked their meals over tiny fires made in the barren places , as the herdsmen have done since time immemorial . The cook , a sullen man at best , grumbled audibly at the increase of his duties . Where before he had cooked for six men , now he must cook and clean up for twelve . All things considered , it was a " helluva " note , he declared , until Sims , overhearing his remarks , booted him a couple of times around the cook wagon , so that he much preferred the arduous duties of his calling . " If yuh could only make every man love his job by contrast with somethin ' else a lot worse , what a peaceful world this would be , " thought Sims . " Now , sheep-herdin ' ai n't so plumb gentle yuh could call it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a round-up I shore do bless them old blackfaces for bein ' alive . " Finally the long-drawn yell of the cook gave notice that the meal was ready and all hands fell to with a will . They had hardly got started , however , when there came a sound of galloping feet from the north that brought them all upstanding and reaching for their weapons . Over a near-by hill swept a body of perhaps fifty horsemen , each with a rifle across his saddle and a revolver at hip . They were typical plainsmen , and as the last radiance of the sun lighted them up , Sims could see that they wore the regular broad-brimmed white Stetsons of the cattle men . " Put down yore guns , boys , " said Sims after a moment 's thought . " Let 's get out o ' this peaceable if we can . " The men put away their weapons and waited in silence . The horsemen swept up at the tireless trot of the plains until they recognized the tall , gaunt figure of the chief herdsman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp , drew rein abruptly , and dismounted . Sims recognized the leader as Jimmie Welsh , the foreman of Larkin 's Montana sheep ranch , and a happy , contented grin spread over his face . " Glory be , boys ! " he yelled , going forward to meet the horsemen . " Rustle around there , cookee , " he called back over his shoulder , " yuh got company fer supper ! " The riders after their long journey were only too glad to see a permanent camp , and dismounted with grunts of pleasure and relief . They had come a distance of nearly two hundred and fifty miles in four days , and their horses were no longer disposed to pitch when their riders got upon them in the morning . The party was composed of all the available men from Larkin 's ranch and others from the neighboring places . In these men the hatred of cowmen and their ways was even more intense than vice versa , this being a result , no doubt , of the manifold insults they had suffered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far outnumber sheep-herders and run them off the country at will . The call to arms taken north by Miguel had met with instant and enthusiastic response , and these men had come south to wipe out in one grand melee their past disgraces . During supper Sims told of Larkin 's offer of five dollars a day , and the riders nodded approvingly ; it was the customary hire of fighting men in the range wars . " But how did you get down over the Bar T range ? " asked the chief herder . " We done that at night , " replied Jimmie Welsh , who was a little man with a ruddy face , bright eyes and a crisp manner of speech . " Tell me what 's that ungodly mess up in Little River ; it was night an ' we could n't see ? " " Two thousand of Larkin 's sheep , " replied Sims , laconically , and an angry murmur ran through the men . " Old Bissell , of the Bar T , stampeded ' em when we were just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up one herder , lammed cookee over the head an ' raised ructions generally . Yes , boys , I 'm plumb shore we have one or two little matters to ask them Bar T punchers about . " " But what 's your orders , Simmy ? " asked Welsh . " I 'm in charge o ' the hull outfit till the boss shows up an ' can do whatever I want . I 'm gettin ' real concerned about him though , not hearin ' a word for a week . I ' low if he do n't turn up to-morrow I 'll have to send you boys lookin ' fer him . " But the morrow brought its own solution of the problem . In the middle of the morning a lone horseman was seen approaching over the hills , and the restless sheepmen , eager for any sport , spread out into a veritable ambuscade , taking position behind rocks and in depressions along the hills on either hand . The horseman was very evidently a poor rider , for , instead of holding the reins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clinging to the pommel of the saddle , while the pony slipped and slid along the difficult path . Within a furlong of the camp , the man 's nationality was made apparent by the flapping shirt and trousers he wore , as well as the black , coarse cue that whipped from side to side . Among the secreted sheepmen a grin spread from face to face at the sight of this distressful figure , evidently in real wo from hours in the hard saddle . About a hundred yards from camp a single shot rang out , and then there arose such a wild chorus of reports and yells as would have terrified a stone image . The cow pony ( which of all horses loathes a bad rider ) showed the whites of his eyes wickedly , laid his ears back into his mane and bucked madly with fright . The Chinaman , chattering like a monkey , described a perfect parabola and alighted right side up on the only tuft of grass within ten yards . In an instant he bounced to his feet , took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolt for the cook-wagon , the one place that was familiar to him . At the door he encountered the sheepmen 's regular cook coming out to see what the trouble was , and the next moment witnessed the near-annihilation of the yellow peril . Sims and Jimmie Welsh pulled the burly cook off in time to save the Oriental , and the latter sat up with a dazed , frightened air . " Yah ! Makee much damee hellee ! " he announced . " Too much damee hellee , " said Sims sententiously . " John , you good fighter . Me like you . What you do here ? " " Me bling message , " and he reached into his blouse and drew out a piece of paper folded and pinned . This he handed to Sims , who promptly opened it and started to read . In a minute he stopped and yelled for everyone who was not in the immediate circle to gather round and listen . Then , haltingly , he read aloud the following : Dear Sims : Ah Sin who brings you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to you to get a job . Pay him fifty dollars on the spot in advance for his first month . I told him you would . He was the Bar T cook , I am sorry to say , but there was no other way of getting a message to you than to send him . For the last few days I have been a prisoner in the " guest room " of the Bar T ranch-house . This is the middle room on the northwest side . After a certain row here I was clapped into confinement , and the Chinaman had to do the honors for me at all meals . I got friendly with him and found he was getting only thirty a month . When he told me he owned one of the horses in the corral the whole thing was easy . I offered him fifty , gave him exact directions how to find your camp , and told him the best time to start . If he ever reaches you , you will know where I am , and I want some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cattlemen from all over are here , and they accuse me of standing in with the rustlers . What will happen to me I do n't know , but I 'm sure of this , it wo n't be healthy . I should think the boys would be down from the north by this time . Now , Simmy , keep everything under your hat and work quietly . Let the sheep pile up if you have to . Things are n't ripe here yet to move ' em north . I 'll be looking for you any day . Bud . When Sims had read the entire note twice , a puzzled silence ensued . Men lifted their hats and scratched their heads meditatively . Here among fifty men there was plenty of energy for action once the action was suggested , but very little initiative . " I allow we 'll shore have to get ' im out o ' there , " seemed to be the consensus of opinion . " Shore , boys , shore , " said Sims impatiently ; " but how ? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart shooters on that ranch , and I 'm plenty sure they do n't all sleep to once . Besides , the worst part of it 'll be gettin ' near the dum place . If a hoss squeals or whinnies the rescuin ' party might as well pick out their graves , ' cause yuh see only two or three can make the trip . " " Mebbe they can an ' mebbe they ca n't , " broke in Jimmie Welsh , his little , bright eyes twinkling with suppressed merriment . " I should think the hull outfit , cook-wagons , an ' all , could make the visit to the Bar T. " " Yeah ? " remarked Sims politely scornful but inquisitive . " Tell us about it . " And Welsh did . CHAPTER XIV SENTENCED Everybody at the Bar T ranch house was laboring under suppressed excitement . It was now the middle of June when the yearly round-up should be under way , yet , owing to the invasion of the sheep and the recent rustler troubles , the cowboys had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring work was well advanced , and the fact that the Bar T had not yet begun was a source of constant worry to Bissell and Stelton . The former , when he had sent out his call for other cowmen of the region , had encountered great difficulty in getting his neighbors to give up their time to the disposal of Bud Larkin 's case . At last , however , ten owners , impatient at the summons and anxious to return as quickly as possible to their work , had ridden in , some of them alone and others with a cowboy taken from the round-up . Since the Bar T ranch house was incapable of accommodating them all , the punchers had been ousted from their bunk-house and the structure given over to the visitors . The sudden disappearance of the Chinese cook had added to Bissell 's troubles and shamed the hospitality of his home . This situation had been relieved temporarily by the labors of Mrs. Bissell and Juliet until an incompetent cowboy had been pressed into service at an exorbitant figure . Therefore it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be called the trial of Larkin . The meeting-place of the men was under a big cottonwood that stood by the bank of the little stream curving past the Bar T. As each man arrived from his home ranch he was made acquainted with the situation as it stood , and one afternoon Larkin was brought out from his room to appear before the tribunal . The owners were determined to end the matter that day , mete out punishment , and ride back to their own ranches in the morning . It was a circle of stern-faced , solemn men that Larkin faced under the cottonwood tree , and as he looked at one after another , his heart sank , for there appeared very little of the quality of mercy in any of them . Knowing as he did the urgency that was drawing them home again , he feared that the swiftness of judgment would be tempered with very little reason . Bissell as head of the organization occupied a chair , while at each side of him five men lounged on the grass , their guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facing them all , and , looking them over , recognized one or two . There was Billy Speaker , of the Circle-Arrow , whom he had once met , and Red Tarken , of the M Square , unmistakable both because of his size and his flaming hair . " Now , Larkin , " began Bissell , " these men know what you 've been tryin ' to do to my range  --  " " Do they know what you did to my sheep ? " interrupted Bud crisply . Bissell 's face reddened at this thrust , for , deep down , he knew that the stampede was an utterly despicable trick , and he was not over-anxious to have it paraded before his neighbors , some of whom had ridden far at his request . " Shut yore mouth , " he snarled , " an ' do n't yuh open it except to answer questions . " " Oh , no , yuh ca n't do that , Bissell , " and blond Billy Speaker shook his head . " Yuh got to give ' im @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want to get all the facts . What did yuh do to his sheep , Beef ? I never heard . " " I run a few of ' em into the Little River , if yore any happier knowin ' , " snapped Bissell , glowering on Speaker . Larkin grinned . " Two thousand of ' em , " he volunteered . There was no comment . " These gents know , " went on Bissell , after a short pause , " that yuh were two days with them rustlers and that yuh can tell who they are if yuh will . Now will yuh tell us how you got in with ' em in the first place ? " Bud began at the time of the crossing of the Big Horn and with much detail described how he had outwitted the Bar T punchers with the hundred sheep under Pedro , while the rest of the flock went placidly north . His manner of address was good , he talked straightforwardly , and with conviction and , best of all , had a broad sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were with Bissell 's cause , Larkin 's story of how a despised sheepman had outwitted the cattle-king brought grins and chuckles . " I allow yuh better steer clear o ' them sheep , Bissell , " suggested one man drolly . " First thing yuh know this feller 'll tell yuh he 's bought the Bar T away from yuh without yore knowin ' it . Better look up yore land grant to-night . " By this time Bissell had become a caldron of seething rage . His hand actually itched to grab his gun and teach Larkin a lesson . But his position as chairman of the gathering prevented this , although he knew that plains gossip was being made with every word spoken . Among the cowmen about him were some whose ill success or smaller ranches had made them jealous , and , in his mind , he could see them retailing with much relish what a fool Larkin had made of him . He knew he would meet with reminders of this trial during the rest of his life . However , he stuck to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , young feller , is this : the names an ' descriptions of them rustlers . " " I will give them to you gladly and will supply men to help run them down at my own expense if you will let the rest of my sheep come north on your range . Not only that , but I will not ask any damages for the animals you have already killed . Now , men , " Larkin added , turning to the others and with a determined ring in his voice , " I want peace . This fighting is cutting our own throats and we are losing money by the hour . " The range is free , as all of you know ; there is a law against fencing it , and that means that no grangers can settle here and make it pay  --  the animals would eat all their unfenced farm truck . I have a ranch in Montana with about three thousand sheep on it . I tried to buy more there , but could n't . " Therefore , I had to come down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like to fight anybody , chiefly because it costs too much ; but in a case like this , when I find a dog in the manger "  --  he looked directly at Bissell  --  " I make it a principle to kick that dog out of the manger and use it . " I am just as much of an American as any of you , and Americans never had a habit of letting other people walk all over them . Now you men can do anything with me you want  --  I ca n't prevent you . But I can warn you that if I am judged in any way it will be the worst job the cowmen of Wyoming ever did . " Understand , this is n't a threat , it 's just a statement . Because I refuse to turn in and help that man , who has done his best to ruin me , he wants me to suffer the same penalty as a criminal . Now I leave it to you . Has he much of a case ? " Bud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down and looked at his hearers . Never in his life had he pleaded for anything , but in this moment necessity had made him eloquent . He had hardly taken his seat when Mike Stelton strolled over and sat down on the grass . For a few minutes there was silence as the men , slow of thought , revolved what Larkin had said . Bissell , ill-concealing his impatience , awaited their comments anxiously . At last Billy Speaker remarked : " I ca n't see your bellyache at all , Bissell . It seems to me you 've acted pretty ornery . " " I have , eh ? " roared Beef , stung by this cool opinion . " Would yuh let sheep go up yore range ? Tell me that , would yuh ? " " I allow I might manage , " was the contemptuous retort . " They 're close feeders on the march , an ' do n't spread out noways far . " Bissell choked with fury , but subsided when another man spoke . " I figure we 're missin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This here association of our'n was made for the purpose of doin ' just what Bissell has been tryin ' to do  --  that is , keep the range clear for the cows . We do n't care what it is that threatens , whether it 's sheep , or wolves , or rustlers , or prairie fires . This association is supposed to pertect the cows . " Now I ' low that Mr. Larkin has had his troubles right enough , but that 's his fault . You warned him in time . I 'm plumb regretful he 's lost his sheep , but that do n't let him out of tellin ' us where them rustlers are . It 's a pretty mean cuss that 'll cost us thousands of dollars a year just for spite or because he ca n't drive a hard bargain . " Up on my place I 've lost a hundred calves already , but I 'd be mighty glad to lose a hundred more if I could see the dirty dogs that stole ' em kickin ' from a tree-limb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody who wo n't tell . " " Yore shore gettin ' some long-winded , Luby , " remarked a tall man who smoked a pipe , " an ' likewise yore angry passions has run away with yore sense . Yuh ca n't string a man up because he wo n't talk ; ' cause if yuh do we 'll sick the deputy sheriff on yuh an ' mebbe you 'll go to jail . " The speaker rolled a droll , twinkling eye at Bissell and the whole gathering burst into a great guffaw at his expense . This was all the more effective since Bissell had decorated the outside of his vest with the nickel-plated star of his authority . At this sally he nearly had apoplexy and bawled out for a drink , which somebody accommodatingly supplied from a flask , although such things were rarely carried . When the merriment had subsided a fourth man volunteered the opinion that , although there was nothing that could force Bud to tell what he knew , still , such a defiance of their organization should not go unpunished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance of sheep into the territory was enough excuse , he thought , to make an example of Bud Larkin and thus keep other ambitious sheepmen away from the range in this section . One after another of the men gave their opinions and finally lined up in two camps , the first resolved on punishing Larkin in some manner , and the second in favor of letting him go with a warning that he must take the consequences if he ever attempted to walk any more sheep over the Bar T range or any other range of the association . As has been said , the right of justice and fair-dealing was the very backbone of the cattle-raising industry , and owners depended almost entirely upon other men 's recognition of it to insure them any profits in the fall . For this reason six of the eleven men were in favor of letting Larkin go . The matter rested with the majority vote and was about to be put to the final ballot when Mike Stelton got on his feet and asked if he might put a few questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interruption that might change the sentiment of the majority , granted the request . Stelton 's dark face was illumined for a moment with a crafty smile , and then he said : " Yuh know a man by the name of Smithy Caldwell , do n't yuh ? " " Yes , " said Bud , cautiously , not seeing quite where the question might lead . " He was in that stampede with yuh , was n't he ? " " Yes . " " He was one of the party sent out to string yuh up , was n't he ? " This time there was a long hesitation as Bud tried vainly to catch the drift of the other 's interrogation . " Yes , " he answered slowly at last . " Well , then , he must have been one of the rustlers , " cried Stelton in a triumphant voice , turning to the rest of the men , who were listening intently . " All right , I admit it , " remarked Larkin coolly . " I do n't see where that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an ' yuh will in a minute , " retorted Stelton . " Now just one or two more questions . " Do you remember the first night Caldwell came to the Bar T ranch ? " Larkin did not answer . A premonition that he was in the toils of this man concerning that dark thing in his past life smote him with a chill of terror . He remembered wondering that very night whether or not Stelton had been listening to his talk with Caldwell . Then the recollection suddenly came to him that , even though he had heard , the foreman could not expose the thing that was back of it all . Once more he regained his equilibrium . " Yes , I remember that night , " he said calmly . " All right ! " snapped Stelton , his words like pistol-shots . " Then yuh remember that Smithy Caldwell got five hundred dollars from yuh after a talk by the corral , do n't you ? " " Yes , " replied Larkin , in immense relief that Stelton had not mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cried the foreman with the air of a lawyer making a great point , " yuh have the admission from Larkin that he gave money secretly to one of the rustlers . If that ai n't connivance and ackchul support I 'm a longhorn heifer . " He sat down on the grass triumphantly . It seemed to Bud Larkin as though some gigantic club had descended on the top of his head and numbed all his senses . Careful as he had been , this wily devil had led him into a labyrinthic maze of questions , the end of which was a concealed precipice . And , like one of his own sheep , he had leaped over it at the leader 's call ! He looked at the faces of his judges . They were all dark now and perplexed . Even Billy Speaker seemed convinced . Bud admitted to himself that his only chance was to refute Stelton 's damaging inference . But how ? The cowmen were beginning to talk in low tones among themselves and there was not much time . Suddenly an idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trepidation . " Men , " he said , " Stelton did not pursue his questions far enough . " " What d'yuh mean by that ? " asked Bissell , glaring at him savagely . " I mean that he did not ask me what Caldwell actually did with the money I gave him . He made you believe that Smithy used it for the rustlers with my consent . That is a blamed lie ! " " What did he do with it ? " cried Billy Speaker . " Ask Stelton , " shouted Bud , suddenly leaping out of his chair and pointing an accusing finger at the foreman . " He seems to know so much about everything , ask him ! " The foreman , dazed by the unexpected attack , turned a surprised and harrowed countenance toward the men as he scrambled to his feet . He cast quick , fearful glances in Larkin 's direction , as though attempting to discover how much of certain matters that young man actually knew . " Ask him ! " repeated Bud emphatically . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a larkum story that he ca n't follow up . " " Come on , Stelton , loosen yore jaw , " suggested Billy Speaker . " What did this here Caldwell do with the money ? " Stelton , his face black with a cloud of rage and disappointment , glared from one to another of the men , who were eagerly awaiting his replies . Larkin , watching him closely , saw again those quick , furtive flicks of the eye in his direction , and the belief grew upon him that Stelton was suspicious and afraid of something as yet undreamed of by the rest . Larkin determined to remember the fact . " I do n't know what he done with the money , " growled the foreman at last , admitting his defeat . " Why did you give Caldwell five hundred in the first place , Larkin ? " asked Bissell suddenly . " That is a matter between himself and me only , " answered Bud freezingly , while at the same time he sat in fear and trembling that Stelton would leap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conversation of that night at the corral . But for some reason the foreman let the opportunity pass and Bud wondered to himself what this sudden silence might mean . He knew perfectly well that no gentle motive was responsible for the fellow 's attitude , and wrote the occurrence down on the tablets of his memory for further consideration at a later date . After this there was little left to be done . Stelton 's testimony had failed in its chief purpose , to compass the death of Larkin , but it had not left him clear of the mark of suspicion and he himself had little idea of absolute acquittal . Under the guard of his sharpshooting cow-puncher he was led back to his room in the ranch house to await the final judgment . In an hour it was delivered to him , and in all the history of the range wars between the sheep and cattle men there is recorded no stranger sentence . In a land where men were either guilty or innocent , and , therefore , dead or alive , it stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a warning and example to other sheep owners , Bud Larkin should be tied to a tree and quirted , the maximum of the punishment being set at thirty blows and the sentence to be carried out at dawn . CHAPTER XV COWLAND TOPSY-TURVY To Bud Larkin enough had already happened to make him as philosophical as Socrates . Epictetus remarks that our chief happiness should consist in knowing that we are entirely indifferent to calamity ; that disgrace is nothing if our consciences are right and that death , far from being a calamity is , in fact , a release . But the world only boasts of a few great minds capable of believing these theories , and Larkin 's was not one of them . He was distinctly and completely depressed at the prospect ahead of him . It was about ten o'clock at night and he sat in the chair beside his table , upon which a candle was burning , running over the pages of an ancient magazine . The knowledge of what the cowmen had decided to do with him had been brought by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supper hour and since that time Larkin had been fuming and growling with rage . There seems to be something particularly shameful in a whipping that makes it the most dreaded of punishments . It was particularly so at the time in which this story is laid , for echoes of ' 65 were still to be heard reverberating from one end of the land to the other . In the West whippings were of rare occurrence , if not unknown , except in penitentiaries , where they had entirely too great a vogue . Larkin 's place of captivity was now changed . Some enterprising cowboy , at Bissell 's orders , had fashioned iron bars and these were fixed vertically across the one window . The long-unused lock of the door had been fitted with a key and other bars fastened across the doorway horizontally so that should Larkin force the lock he would still meet opposition . Since Juliet 's unpleasant episode with her father Bud had seen her just once  --  immediately afterward . Then , frankly and sincerely , she had told him what had happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had pleaded with her for the greatest happiness of his life . The realization of their need for each other was the natural outcome of the position of each , and the fact that , whatever happened , Juliet found herself forced to espouse Bud 's cause . In that interview with her father she had come squarely to the parting of the ways , and had chosen the road that meant life and happiness to her . The law that human intellects will seek their own intellectual level , providing the person is sound in principle , had worked out in her case , and , once she had made her decision , she clung to it with all the steadfastness of a strong and passionate nature . It was Bissell 's discovery of a new and intimate relation between his daughter and the sheepman that had resulted in the latter 's close confinement , and from the time that this occurred the two had seen nothing of each other except an occasional glimpse at a distance when Bud was taken out for a little exercise . To-night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enacted at dawn , his sense of shame increased a hundredfold , for he knew that , as long as she lived , Julie could not forget the occurrence . It should not be thought that all this while he had not formulated plans of escape . Many had come to him , but had been quickly dismissed as impracticable . Day and night one of the Bar T cowboys watched him . And even though he had been able to effect escape from his room , he knew that without a horse he was utterly helpless on the broad , level stretches of prairie . And to take a horse from the Bar T corral would lay him open to that greatest of all range crimes  --  horse-stealing . To-night his guards had been doubled . One paced up and down outside his window and the other sat in the dining-room on which his door opened . Now , at ten o'clock the entire Bar T outfit was asleep . Since placing the bunk-house at the disposal of the cowmen from other ranches , the punchers slept on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtaken by night on the open range . At ten-thirty Bud put out his candle , undressed , and went to bed . But he could not sleep . His mind reverted to Hard-winter Sims and the sheep camp by the Badwater . He wondered whether the men from Montana had arrived there yet , and , most intensely of all , he wondered whether Ah Sin had got safely through with his message . He calculated that the Chinaman must have arrived three days before unless unexpectedly delayed , and he chafed at the apparent lack of effort made on his behalf . The only explanation that offered itself was  --  that Sims , taking advantage of the events happening at the Bar T , had seized the opportunity to hurry the gathering sheep north across the range . If such was the case , Larkin resigned himself to his fate , since he had given Sims full power to do as he thought best . At about midnight he was dimly conscious of a scuffling sound outside his window , and , getting softly out of bed , went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a man rose gradually above the window-sill close to the house , and a moment later he was looking into the face of Hard-winter Sims . Controlling the shock this apparition gave him , Larkin placed his finger on his lips and whispered in a tone so low it was scarcely more than a breath : " Did you get the fellow outside ? " Sims nodded . " There 's another one in the dining-room just outside my door . He ought to be relieved at one o'clock , but he 'll have to go out and wake up his relief . He 'll go out the kitchen door , and when he does nab him , but do n't let him yell . Now pass me a gun . " Without a sound , Sims inserted a long .45 between the clumsy bars , and followed it with a cartridge belt . " How 'll we get yuh out ? " he whispered . " After fixing the man inside come out again and loosen these bars ; the door is barred , too . " " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bunk-house , and the punchers are sleeping out near the corral . " " Yes , I seen ' em . Now you go back to bed an ' wait till I hiss through the window . Then we 'll have yuh out o ' here in a jiffy . " The herder 's form vanished in the darkness , and Larkin , his heart beating high with hope and excitement , returned to his bed . Before lying down , however , he dressed himself completely and strapped on the cartridge belt and gun . The minutes passed like hours . Listening with every nerve fiber on the alert , Bud found the night peopled with a multitude of sounds that on an ordinary occasion would have passed unnoticed . So acute did his sense of hearing become that the crack of a board in the house contracting under the night coolness seemed to him almost like a pistol shot . When at last it appeared that Sims must have failed and that dawn would surely begin to break , he heard a heavy sound in the dining-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there preparing to go out and waken his successor . Although the man made as little noise as possible , it seemed to Bud that his footsteps must wake everybody in the house . The man went out of the dining-room into the mess-room of the cowboys , closing the door behind him softly , and after that what occurred was out of the prisoner 's ken . After a while , however , Bud 's ears caught the faintest breath of a hiss at the window , and he rolled softly out of bed on to the floor in his stocking feet . Sims was there and another man with him , and both were prying at the bars of the window with instruments muffled in cloth . " Did you get him ? " asked Bud . " Shore ! He wo n't wake up for a week , that feller , " answered Sims placidly . For a quarter of an hour the two worked at the clumsy bars , assisted by Bud from the inside . At the end of that time two of them came loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the combined efforts of the three men were centered on the third bar , which gave way in a few minutes . Handing his boots out first , Larkin crawled headforemost out of the window and put his arms around the shoulders of his rescuers , resting most of his weight upon their bent backs . Then they walked slowly away from the house and Bud 's feet and legs came out noiselessly . Still in the shadow of the walls they set him down and he drew on his boots . It was not until then that Sims 's assistant made himself known . " Hello , boss , " he said and took off his broad hat so that Larkin could see his face . " Jimmie Welsh , by George ! " whispered Bud joyfully , wringing his hand . " Did you bring many of the boys down with you ? " " Fifty , " replied the other . " Bully for you ! I do n't know what would become of me if it were n't for you and Hard-winter . " As they talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past the Bar T house . " Got a horse for me ? " asked Bud . " Yes , " said Sims , " over here in the bottoms where the rest of the boys are . " " What do you plan to do now ? " Sims told him and Bud grinned delightedly at the same time that his face hardened with the triumph of a revenge about to be accomplished . " Let 's get at it , " he said . " Wait here and I 'll get the rest of the bunch . " Hard-winter left them , and in a few minutes returned with a dozen brawny sheepmen , mostly recruited from Larkin 's own ranch in Montana . When greetings had been exchanged they moved off quietly toward the ranch-house . The corral of the Bar T was about fifty yards back of the cook 's shanty and as you faced it had a barn on the right-hand side , where the family saddle horses were kept in winter , as well as the small amount of hay that Bissell put up every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was open , and here the Bar T punchers had made their camp since leaving their former quarters . The bunk-house on the other hand stood perhaps fifty feet forward of the barn . It was toward this building that the expedition under Sims took its way . Silently the rough door swung back on its rawhide hinges and ten men , with a revolver in each hand , filed quietly in . Sims and Larkin remained outside on guard . Presently there was a sound of muttering and cursing that grew louder . Then one yell , and the solid thud of a revolver butt coming in contact with a human skull . After that there was practically no noise whatever . The men outside watched anxiously , fearful that the single outcry had raised an alarm . But there was no sound from either the house or the cowboys ' camp . Presently Welsh stuck his head out of the door . " How is she ? Safe ? " he asked . " Yes , bring ' em out , " answered Bud , and the next minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gagged , and with their hands bound behind them , walked single file , accompanied by one of the sheepmen . Without a word the line turned in the direction of the river bottoms , where the rest of the band and the horses were waiting . To do this it was necessary to pass behind the cook-house . Bud leaned over and spoke to Sims . " Ca n't we get Bissell in this party ? He 's the fellow that has made all the trouble . " " Sure , Jimmy and I will go in and get him . I had forgotten all about him . " But they were saved the trouble , for just as they were opposite the cook-house , Larkin saw a burly form outlined for an instant in the doorway of the cowboys ' dining-room . With three bounds he was upon this form and arrived just in time to seize a hand that was vainly tugging at a revolver strapped on beneath his night clothes . Had fortune not tangled Bissell 's equipment that night Bud Larkin would have been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over the cattle king 's mouth , and an instant later Bissell , writhing and struggling , but silent , was being half-carried out to join his friends . Matters now proceeded with speed and smoothness . The prisoners were hurried to where the remainder of the band awaited them . Then , still bound and gagged , they were mounted on spare horses . Only thirty of Welsh 's raiders had come on this trip , the rest remaining to help with the sheep , but their horses had been brought so that there might be ample provision for everybody . With a feeling of being once more at home , Larkin climbed into a deep saddle , and a wave of triumph surged over him . He was again free , and at the head of a band of brave men . He had the ascendency at last over his misfortune , and he intended to keep it . Then when everything was finished he could come back and he would find Juliet  --  The remembrance of her brought him to a pause . Must he go away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one for whom he cared more than all the rest of the world ? Quietly he dismounted . " Let Jimmie go on with the prisoners and the rest of the boys , " he said to Sims . " You wait here with me . I must leave one message . " A minute later the cavalcade stole away , following the winding river bank for a mile before setting foot on the plain . Then , with Sims crouching , armed , behind the nearest protection , Bud Larkin walked softly to the house . He knew which was her window and went straight there , finding it open as he had expected . Listening carefully he heard no sound from within . Then he breathed the one word , " Julie , " and immediately there came a rustling of the bed as she rose . Knowing that she had been awake and was coming to him , he turned away his eyes until he felt her strong little hand on his shoulder . Then he looked up to find her in an overwrap with her luxuriant hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luminously dusky . " Darling , " she said , " I have heard everything , and I am so glad . " " Then you could have given the alarm at any time ? " " Yes . " " God bless your faithful little heart ! " he said fervently , and , reaching up , drew down her face to his and kissed her . It was their second kiss and they both thrilled from head to foot with this tantalization of the hunger of their love . All the longing of their enforced separation seemed to burst the dam that had held it , and , for a time , they forgot all things but the living , moving tide of their own love . At last the girl disengaged herself from his eager hands , with hot cheeks and bright , flame-lit eyes . Her breath came fast , and it was a moment before she could compose herself . " Where are you going now , Bud ? " she asked . " Back to the sheep . " " Can I do anything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing , and that is to marry me . " " Everything in time , sir ! " she reproved him . " Get your muttons out of the way and then you can have me . " Larkin groaned . Then he said : " If anything comes for me or anybody wants me , I want you to do as I would do if I were here . Things are coming to a climax now and I must know all that goes on . Watch Stelton especially . He is crooked somewhere , and I 'm going to get him if it takes me the rest of my life . " Suddenly there was a loud knock from outside the girl 's bedroom door , and they both listened , hardly daring to breathe . " Julie , let me in ! " cried Mrs. Bissell 's querulous voice . " Where 's your father ? " " Run , dear boy , for your life ! " breathed the girl . Larkin kissed her swiftly and hurried back to the underbrush , where Sims was awaiting him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss ! " he growled as they rode along the bank , " ai n't yuh got no consideration fer me ? From the way yuh go on a person 'd think yuh were in love with the girl . " CHAPTER XVI A MESSAGE BY A STRANGE HAND What were the feelings of Mr. Mike Stelton that dawn had better be imagined than described . The first he knew of any calamity was when Mrs. Bissell , unable to find her husband near the house , shook him frantically by the shoulder . " Get up , Mike , " she cried into his ear . " Somethin 's wrong here . Henry 's nowhere around . " Dazed with sleep , unable to get the proper focus on events , the foreman blundered stupidly about the place searching cursorily , and cursing the helplessness of Beef Bissell . Presently he got awake , however , and perceived that dawn was coming up in the east . Then he reveled in the delightful anticipation of what was to occur out under the old cottonwood along the river bank . Mentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat . He intended if possible to make Juliet witness her lover 's degradation . After vainly hunting some valid excuse for Bissell 's untimely departure , Stelton thought he would call the boys , which he did . Then he turned his attention to the bunk-house , for he knew the cowmen were in a hurry to get away and would want to be called early . " All out ! " he bawled jovially , thrusting his head in at the door . Not a sound came in response . Then for the first time Stelton had a premonition of trouble . He walked into the bunk-house and took quick note of the ten tumbled but empty bunks . Also of the ten belts and revolvers that hung on wooden pegs along the wall  --  the sign of Western etiquette . In those days , and earlier , if a man rode by at meal-time or evening he was your guest . He might take dinner with his hat on , and get his knife and fork mixed , but if he hung up his belt and revolver he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether you thought so or not . The one other unspoken law was that every man 's business was his own business and no questions were allowed . You might be entertaining a real bad man like Billy the Kid , and you might suspect his identity , but you never made inquiries , and for three reasons . The first was , that it was bad plains etiquette ; the second , that if you were mistaken and accused the wrong man , punishment was sure and swift ; and the third was , that if you were right the punishment was still surer and swifter , for an escaping criminal never left any but mute witnesses behind him . Looking at these ten indications of good-will along the bunk-house wall , Stelton 's alarm was once more lulled . Perhaps the men had all gone for a paddle in the stream before breakfast , he thought . If so , they would take care of themselves , and turn up when the big bell rang . He could n't waste any more time this way . Now to relieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He hurried around the house and came upon the prone figure of a cow-puncher , rolled close against the house . The man 's head was bloody , his hands were tied behind him , and his neckerchief had been stuffed into his mouth and held there by another . He was half-dead when Stelton , with a cry of surprise , bent over him and loosened his bonds . With a prolonged yell the foreman brought all hands running to him and , giving the hurt man into the care of a couple of them , ran along the house to Bud 's window . The bent bars showed how the bird had flown . Stelton was about to give way to his fury when another cry from the rear of the cook-house told of the discovery of the second watchman 's body , that had lain hidden in the long grass which grew up against the walls . Then did n't Stelton curse ! Never had he been so moved to profane eloquence , and never did he give such rein to it . He cursed everything in sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that from chimney to cellar , up and down every line and angle , around the corners and out to the barn . Then he began on the barn and wound up with the corral . The cowboys listened in admiration and delight , interjecting words of approval now and then . But once having delivered himself of this relief , the foreman 's face set into its customary ugly scowl , and he snapped out orders to saddle the horses . Presently a man rode up from the river bottoms and told of the discovery of many hoof tracks there , and the place where they had waited a long while . " I 've got it ! " bawled Stelton , pounding his thigh . " Larkin 's men have been here and carried off all the owners . Oh , wo n't there be the deuce to pay ? " Then he picked out the cowboys who had come with their bosses and added : " Crowd yore grub and ride home like blazes . Get yore punchers an ' bring grub for a week . Then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Gooseberry Creek . If yuh punchers like a good job you 'll get yore owners out o ' this . And I 'm plumb shore when we get through there wo n't be a sheepman left in this part of the State . To-morrer night at Gooseberry ! " Then was such a scene of hurry and bustle and excitement as the Bar T had seldom witnessed . The parting injunctions were to bring extra horses and plenty of rope , with the accent on the rope , and a significant look thrown in . By seven o'clock , the time that Larkin , bloody , humiliated and suffering , would already have paid his penalty , there was scarcely a soul at the Bar T ranch , for the cowboys had disappeared across the plains at a hard trot . The Bar T punchers were sent out on the range to scour for tracks of the fugitives , but , after following them some distance from the river bottom , gave up in despair when a night herder admitted that the Bar T horses had been feeding in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meantime the cook was preparing food for the punchers to carry , guns were being oiled and overhauled , knives sharpened , and ropes carefully examined . Yet as the men went about their duties there was a kind of dazed , subdued air in all they did , for it was , indeed , hard to realize that the ranch owners of nearly a quarter of Wyoming 's best range had disappeared into the empty air apparently without a sound or protest . The following afternoon the entire Bar T outfit , excepting a couple of punchers who were incapacitated from former round-up injuries , swept out of the yard and headed almost directly east across the plain . Julie and her mother watched them go and waved them farewell , the former with a clutch of fear at her heart for her lover and the latter in tears for her husband , thus unconsciously taking opposite sides in the struggle that they knew must ensue . It must not be thought that Juliet had turned against her father since their final difference . After her first outbreak against his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love that had been paramount all her life returned , and with it a kind of pity . She knew that in a man of her father 's age his nature could not be made over immediately , if ever ; the habits of a rough lifetime were too firmly ingrained . But at the same time there was something gone from the sweet and intimate affection that had formerly characterized their relations . Lovers or married folk who declare for the efficacy of a quarrel as a renewer of love are wrong in the last analysis . Loss of control always entails loss of respect , and fervent " making up " after such an outbreak can not efface the picture of anger-distorted features or remove the acid of bitter words . Thus it was with Juliet and her love for her father . As to his safety she was not worried , for she knew that Bud would not allow any harm to come to him as he was in command of the men who had effected the taking-off . What Larkin 's plans were she did not fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executed to further his own ends in the imperative matter of getting his sheep north . And of this she finally convinced her mother , although that lady wept copiously before the thing was accomplished . The evening following the departure of Mike Stelton and his punchers was made notable by the arrival of a man on horseback , who carried across his saddle a black box , and in thongs at his side a three-legged standard of yellow wood . His remaining equipment was a square of black cloth . Without invitation he turned his dejected animal into the Bar T corral and made himself at home for the evening . At the supper table he revealed his identity and explained his purpose . " I 'm Ed Skidmore , " he announced , " and I take photographs . This thing I 've got is a camera . " He had already mounted the instrument on his tripod . " I 've been going around from ranch to ranch and the pictures have been selling like hot cakes . " Juliet , listening , noted that his conversation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of the characteristic drawl or accent of the plainsmen . To her a camera was nothing out of the ordinary , although she had not seen one since her final return West , but her mother was vastly interested . In those days photography was not a matter of universal luxury as it is now , and the enterprising Skidmore was practically the first to introduce it as a money-maker in the widely scattered ranches of the cow country . " How do yuh sell ' em ? " asked Martha Bissell , fluttering with the possibilities of the next morning , the time the young man had set for his operation . Martha had not been " took " since that far-off trip " East " to St. Paul , when she and Henry had posed for daguerreotypes . " Five dollars apiece , ma'am , " said Skidmore , " and they 're cheap at the price . " And they were , since the cost of something universally desired is dependent on the supply rather than the demand . After supper Martha retired to her bedroom to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock that had not been disturbed in fifteen years except for the spring cleaning and airing . This left Skidmore and Juliet alone . She civilly invited him out on the veranda , seeing he was a man of some quality . " I had a queer experience to-day , " he remarked after a few commonplaces . " I was riding to the Bar T from the Circle-Arrow and was about twenty miles away , rounding a butte , when a man rode out to me from some place of concealment . " When he reached me he suddenly pulled his gun and covered me . " ' Where are you goin ' ? ' he said . I told him I was on my way here and why . He examined my outfit suspiciously and let me go . But first he said : " ' Take this letter to the Bar T and give it to Miss Bissell . ' " Skidmore reached inside his shirt and pulled forth a square envelope , which he handed to Juliet . " The whole thing was so strange , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until I could see you alone so that I could tell you about it . " Juliet , surprised and startled , turned the missive over in her hands , hopeful that it was a letter from Bud and yet fearful of something that she could not explain . When Skidmore had finished she excused herself and went into her room , closing the door behind her . On the envelope was the simple inscription , " Miss Bissell , " written in a crabbed , angular hand . This satisfied her that the message was not from Bud , and with trembling fingers she opened it . Inside was an oblong sheet of paper filled with the same narrow handwriting . Going to the window to catch the dying light , she read : Miss : This is to tell yuh that Mr. Larkin who yuh love is already merried . It ai n't none of my biznis , but I want yuh to no it . An ' that ai n't all . The U. s. oficers are looking for him on another charge , tu . Nobody noes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will as long as the monie keeps comin ' in . If yuh doant bileeve this , axe him . Yurs Truly , A Friend . In the difficulty of translating the words before her into logical ideas the full import of the statements made did not penetrate Juliet 's mind at first . When they did she merely smiled a calm , contemptuous smile . With the usual fatuous faith of a sweetheart , she instantly consigned to limbo anything whatever derogatory to her beloved . Then in full possession of herself , she returned to the veranda , where Skidmore was smoking a cigarette . " No bad news I hope ? " he asked politely , scrutinizing her features . " Oh , no , thanks , " she replied , laughing a little unnaturally . " Not really bad , just disturbing , " and they continued their interrupted conversation . But that night when she was in bed the crude letters of that missive appeared before her eyes in lines of fire . Of late the old mystery of Bud 's past life had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had successfully wiped away the last traces of uneasiness that she had felt , and like all true and good women , she had given him the priceless treasure of her love , not questioning , not seeking to discern what he would have shown her had it seemed right in his mind that she should see . But this scrawled letter to-night brought back with stunning force all the distress and doubts that had formerly assailed her . She guessed , and rightly , that Smithy Caldwell was the author of it , but she could not analyze the motives that had inspired his pen . She told herself with fatal logic that if all this were a lie , Caldwell would not dare write it ; that Larkin had paid this man five hundred dollars on another occasion not so far gone ; and that it was avowedly a case of impudent blackmail . She knew , furthermore , that Bud carefully avoided all references to Caldwell even when she had brought forward the name , and that in the conversation overheard by Stelton there had been mention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money were going to another woman ! The thought overwhelmed her as she lay there , and she sat up gasping for breath , but in a moment the eternal defense of the man , inherent in every woman who loves , came to the rescue , and she told herself vehemently that Bud was honorable , if nothing else . Then the sentence concerning the United States officers wanting him on another charge recurred to her , and she found her defense punctured at the outset . If he were honorable , how could it be that the officers were after him ? In despair at the quandary , but still clinging to her faith , she fell back on the unanswerable fact of feminine intuition . Bud seemed good and true ; it was in his eyes , in his voice , in his very manner . He looked at the world squarely , but with a kind of patient endurance that bespoke some deep trouble . Then for the first time the thought came to Juliet that perhaps he was shielding someone else . But who ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Unable to answer these questions , but confronted by the thought that Bud 's love was the sweetest thing in the world to her , she at last fell asleep with a smile upon her lips . CHAPTER XVII A BATTLE IN THE DARK " Everything ready ? " Bud Larkin sat his horse beside Hard-winter Sims and looked back over the white mass that grew dimmer and dimmer in the dark . " Yes . " Sims lounged wearily against the horse 's shoulder . It had been a hard day . " Get ' em on the move , then . " Sims , without changing his position , called out to the herders . These in turn spoke to the dogs , and the dogs began to nip the heels of the leader sheep , who resented the familiarity with loud blatting and lowering of heads . But they knew the futility of resisting these nagging guardians and started to forge ahead . Other dogs got the middlers in motion , and still others attended to the tailers , so that in five minutes from the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly over the dry plain . Eight thousand of them there were ; eight thousand semi-imbecile creatures , unacquainted with the obstacles they must encounter or the dangers they must face before they could be brought to safety or lost in the attempt . And to guard them there were nearly seventy men whose fear lay not in the terrors to be met , but in the sheep themselves : for there is no such obstacle to a sheep 's well-being as the sheep himself . The last flock had arrived the night before , well-fed and watered . The preceding six thousand were in good condition from days and weeks of comfortable grazing in the hills ; all were in good shape to travel . In moving them at this time Larkin had seized the psychological moment . The disgruntled cattle-owners , under a guard of ten men , were resting quietly far from anything resembling excitement in one of the untracked places among the mesas and scoria buttes . Bud had ascertained , by spies of his own that scoured the country , that the great posse of rescuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misled by one of the sheepmen who was unknown in the country . For the present , therefore , the range was clear , and Bud reckoned on its remaining so until the cattlemen had been rescued from their durance vile . In such a time the sheep-danger shrank into insignificance , and Larkin counted on having his animals across the Bar T range before the finding of the cattlemen , after which , of course , the men would be turned loose with much commiseration and apology . Of the seventy men guarding and driving the sheep not more than thirty were regular herders . Forty were mounted and belonged to Jimmie Welsh 's fighting corps , which was composed mostly of owners and superintendents from the north country . Your usual Western shepherd is not a fighting man and cases have occurred in the bitter range wars where a herder has been shot down in cold blood unable to make a defense because of the grass growing out of his rifle . Years alone in the brooding silence of the Sierra slopes or the obscure valleys of the northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him placid and at one with nature . Into his soul there sinks something of the grandeur of cloud-hooded peaks , the majesty of limitless horizons and the colors of sky-blue water and greensward . With him strife is an unknown thing except for the strife of wits with another herder who would attempt to share a succulent mountain meadow . Common report has it , and such writers as Emerson Hough put it in their books , that a sheep-herder can scarcely follow his calling for seven years without going mad . On the other hand , those who have lived for years among the sheep declare that they have never seen a sheep-herder even mentally unbalanced . Probably both are right , as is usual to a degree in all discussion ; but the fact remained that , sane or insane , the herder was not a fighting man  --  something had gone out of him . Therefore in bringing men other than herders south with him , Jimmie Welsh had shown his cleverness . To fight riders he had brought riders , and these men now helped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry plain . There were two cook outfits to feed the men , one of which contained the incomparable Ah Sin , who had amply revenged himself on the herders for his warm reception at the camp . That first night they marched ten miles , and , as before , found the water-holes polluted by the cattle which take delight in standing in the mud , and thus in a dry country work their own destruction by filling the springs . The next day the sheep cropped fairly well , although the sun was terrific and no more water was discovered . Nightfall found them becoming nervous and uneasy . They milled a long while before they bedded , and more of them than usual stood up to watch . Not a rider had been seen all day . Through the baking glare there had moved a cloud of suffocating dust , and under it the thirsting , snorting , blethering sheep , with the dogs on the edges and the men farther out at regular intervals along the line . After supper some of the men slept , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they needed the rest , being footsore with long traveling . It was calculated also that they would reach the ford at the Big Horn by shortly before dawn . But the sheep would have none of it , and moved and milled uneasily until , in order to save the lambs that were being crushed in the narrowing circle , Sims gave the order to resume the march . The night " walk " of sheep is a strange thing . First , perhaps , rides a shepherd , erect and careless in his saddle , the red light glowing from the tip of his cigarette ; and beside his horse a collie-dog , nosing at objects , but always with ears for the sheep and the voice of his master . Then come the sheep themselves , with cracking ankle-joints , clattering feet , muffled blethering , a cloud of dust , and the inevitable sheep smell . Perhaps there is a moon , and then the herders must watch for racing cloud-shadows that cause stampedes . Such was the picture of the Larkin sheep that night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten , and Sims sent Miguel forward to walk before them , so they would not exhaust themselves with too fast traveling . On the move the sheep seemed more contented . It was perhaps one o'clock in the morning that Larkin , in company with his chief herder , spurred out far in front of the advancing flock to reconnoiter . The sheep would be within approaching distance of the ford in a couple of hours , and Bud wished everything to be clear for them . Nearing the Big Horn , Sims suddenly drew up his horse , motioning Bud to silence . Listening intently , they heard the voice of a man singing an old familiar plains song . The two looked at each other in amazement , for this was one of the " hymns " the cowboys use to still their cattle at night , the time of the most dreaded stampedes . It was the universal theory of the cow country that cattle , particularly on a " drive , " should not be long out of hearing of a human voice . So the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sang to the cattle , although some of the ditties rendered were strong enough to stampede a herd of kedge-anchors . " Cows here ? " said Sims . " What does this mean , boss ? " " It means that we 're beaten to the ford and will have to hold the sheep back . " " Yes , but who 's driving now ? This is round-up and branding season . " " I do n't know , but between you and me , Sims , I 'll bet a lamb to a calf that the rustlers are running their big pickings north . There are some mighty good heads at the top of that crowd , and they have taken advantage of the deserted range , just as we have , to drive their critters . " " By George ! You 've hit it , boss ! " cried Sims , slapping his thigh . " Now , what do yuh say to do ? " For a long minute of silence Bud Larkin thought . Then he said : " Here 's my chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There ca n't be more than a dozen or fifteen of them at the outside . Ride back to the camp , Simmy , and get twenty men , the best gun-rollers in the outfit . Tell anybody that 's afraid of his hide to stay away , for the rustlers are top-notch gun-fighters . " " But what 'll yuh do with a thousand cattle on yore hands ? " demanded Hard-winter in amazement . " I 'll tell you that if we get ' em , " was Bud 's reply . " As I see it , we ca n't do without them . " The plan of campaign was somewhat indefinite . The last intention in the world was to frighten away the cattle by a grand charge and a salvo of young artillery . With great caution the sheepmen approached near enough to discern the white cover of the cook-wagon , when it was seen that the whole herd was slowly moving toward the ford , the singing rustlers circling around it . Bud told off a dozen of his riders and instructed each to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as possible without being seen . Then , at the signal of a coyote 's howl twice given , to close in and get the drop on the rustlers , after which the remainder of the body would come along and take the direction of things . Sims was put in charge of this maneuver , and was at liberty to give the signal whenever he thought circumstances justified it . It was a strange procession that marched toward the ford of the Big Horn  --  first fifteen hundred head of calves and young steers , guarded by unsuspecting rustlers ; then the knot of sheepmen and the dozen riders closing in on their quarry , and , last of all three miles back , eight thousand sheep clattering through the dust . For what seemed almost half an hour there was silence . Then suddenly came the far-off , long-drawn howl of a coyote , immediately followed by another . Bud set spurs into his horse , revolver in hand , the remaining eight men at his heels , and made directly for the cook-wagon , where he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping . The drumming of the horse 's hoofs could now be plainly heard from all sides , and a moment later there was a stab of light in the dark and the first shot rang out . After that there were many shots , for the rustlers , keyed up to great alertness by the hazardness of their calling , had opened fire without waiting for question or answer . Bud , as he dashed up to the cook-wagon , saw two men crawl out and stand for a minute looking . Then , as their hands moved to their hip-pockets like one , he opened fire . At almost the same instant the flames leaped from their guns , and Bud 's hat was knocked awry by a bullet that went clean through it . Meantime the man who had been riding beside him gave a grunt and fell from his saddle . One of the rustlers doubled up where he stood . Larkin , to avoid crashing full into the cook-wagon , swerved his horse aside , as did the others . The horse of the man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that moment the rustler who remained standing gave one leap and had bestridden him . Bud saw the maneuver just in time to wheel his horse on a spot as big as a dollar and take after the man in the darkness , yelling back , " Get the others ! " as he rode . It was now a matter between the pursuer and the pursued . Pounding away into the darkness , heedless of gopher-holes , sunken spots , and other dangers , the two sped . Occasionally the man ahead would turn in his saddle and blaze away at his pursuer , and Bud wondered that none of these hastily fired bullets came near their mark . For his part he saved his fire . It was not his idea to shoot the rustlers , but rather to capture them alive , since the unwritten law of that lawless land decreed that shooting was too merciful a death for horse- or cattle-thieves . Illustration : A moment later there was a stab of light in the dark and the first shot rang out . But Larkin found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other was faster than his own , and when they had galloped about a mile he had to strain his eyes to see the other at all . He knew that unless he did something at once the other would get away from him . He lifted his revolver and took careful aim at the barely perceptible form of the horse . Then , when the other fired again , Larkin returned the shot , and almost immediately noticed that he was creeping up . At fifty yards the fleeing man blazed away again , and this time Bud heard the whistle of the bullet . Without further delay he took a pot-shot at the rustler 's gun arm and , by one of those accidents that the law of chance permits to happen perhaps once in a lifetime , got him . After that the rustler pulled up his failing animal to a walk and faced him around . " Hands up ! " yelled Larkin , covering the other . The answer was a streak of yellow flame from the fellow 's left hand that had been resting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man had never shot left-handed before , and Bud , furious at the deception , dashed to close quarters recklessly , not daring to shoot again for fear of killing his man . This move broke the rustler 's courage , and his left hand shot skyward . His right arm being broken , he could not raise it . Larkin rode alongside of him and peered into his face . It was Smithy Caldwell . Quickly Bud searched him for other weapons . " What 're yuh goin ' to do with me , Larkin ? " whined the blackmailer . " Do n't take me back there . I have n't done nothin ' . " " Shut up and do n't be yellow , " admonished Bud . " If you 're not guilty of anything you can prove it quick enough , I guess . " " I saved your life once , " pleaded the other . " Let me go . " " You saved it so you could get more money out of me . Think I do n't know you , Caldwell ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back all that money and all the rest you 've ever given me . For God 's sake do n't let ' em hang me ! " The cowardice of the man was pitiful , but Bud was unmoved . For years his life had been dogged by this man . Now , an openly avowed rustler , he expected clemency from his victim . " Ride ahead there , " ordered Bud . Caldwell , whimpering , took his position . " Put your hands behind you . " The other made as though to comply with this command , when suddenly with a swift motion he put something in his mouth . Instantly Bud had him by the throat , forcing his mouth open . Caldwell , forced by this grip , spat out something that Bud caught with his free hand . It was a piece of paper . Larkin slipped it into the pocket of his shirt and released his clutch . Then he bound Smithy 's hands and started back toward the scene of the raid . When he arrived , with his prisoner riding ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . Two of the rustlers were dead , but the rest were sitting silent on the ground by the side of the cook-wagon . One sheepman had been killed , and another 's broken shoulder was being roughly dressed by Sims . Others of the sheepmen were riding around the herd , quieting it . That there had been no stampede was due to the fact that the shooting had come from all sides at once , and the creatures , bewildered , had turned in upon themselves and crowded together in sheer terror , trampling to death a number in the center of the herd . Less than half a mile ahead were the banks of the Big Horn and the ford . A mile behind the leaders of the sheep were steadily advancing . There was only one thing to be done . " Drive the cows across the ford , " commanded Bud . Then he told off a detail to guard the prisoners , and the rest of the men got the cattle in motion toward the crossing . Bud did not join this work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper that Smithy Caldwell had attempted to swallow . By the light of a match he read what it said : The range is clear . Drive north fast to-nite and travel day and nite . Meet me to-morrow at Indian Coulee at ten . Burn this . Stelton . For a minute Bud stared at the incriminating paper , absolutely unable to digest the information it carried . Then with a rush understanding came to him , and he knew that Mike Stelton , the trusted foreman of the Bar T ranch , was really the leader of the rustlers , and was the most active of all of them in robbing old Beef Bissell . For a long time he sat motionless on his horse , reviewing all the events that had passed , which now explained the remarkable activity of the rustlers and their ability to escape pursuit and capture . " I do n't know where Indian Coulee is , Stelton , " he said to himself , " but I 'll be there at ten if it 's within riding distance . " CHAPTER XVIII THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grinned sheepishly . " Yuh got me this time , " he said . Billy Speaker , who held a full house , kings up , smiled pleasantly . " I allow yuh 'll have to put yore gun in the next pot if you want to stick along , " he said . " An ' if yuh do I 'll win it off yuh and get away from here . " " No , " said Jimmie regretfully , " if it was any other time I might resk it , but not now . " Red Tarken , who had been shuffling the single greasy pack of cards , began to deal . In the game beside these three were two more sheepmen and another cattle-raiser . The six sat in the shade of a huge bowlder that had broken off and rolled down the side of the red scoria butte . The game had been going on for hours , and captors and captives alike played with all the cowboys ' fervent love of gambling . Tarken , Speaker , and their companion were free to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to overpower their guardians . Others of the eleven owners sat about in the shade of rocks , playing cards , or talking and doing their best to pass away the time . It was a strange gathering . Only one man remained sitting by himself with bent head and his hands bound behind him . This was Beef Bissell , the cattle-king , who had steadfastly refused to give his word to remain peaceable , and fumed his life away hour after hour with vain threats and recriminations . At either end of the small inclosure that backed against the butte , two men with Winchesters in their hands bestrode motionless horses . This perpetual guard , kept night and day , though invisible from all but one small point , was the only sign that there was anything but the kindliest relations among all the members of the party . When the cowmen had found that no personal harm was to be done them , all but Bissell and one other had resigned themselves to making the best of a laughably humiliating situation . It was Billy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as Jimmie Welsh knew the word of a Westerner was as good as his bond , the pact was soon consummated . It was a remarkable formation in a desolate spot that the sheepmen had taken for a prison . It is a common fact that on many of these high buttes and mesas the pitiless weather of ages has chiseled figures , faces , and forms which , in their monstrous grotesquery , suggest the discarded clay modelings of a half-witted giant . This place was a kind of indentation in the side of a precipitous butte , above which the cliff ( if it may be so called ) arched over part way like a canopy . The floor was of rock and lower than the plain , but over it were scattered huge blocks of stone that had fallen from above . Other stones had , in the course of time , made a sort of breastwork about this level flooring so that the retreat was both a refuge and a defense . Better even than its construction was its situation . This particular spot was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lumpy ridges , hogbacks , and barren buttes arose on all sides like waves in a sea . So numerous were they that unless riders passed directly by the sheepmen 's hiding place the chances of discovery were almost nil . At one spot only was it visible , and that was a place where the edges of two hogbacks failed to lap and hide it . The sheepmen were aware of this , and their two guards were placed out of range of that single opening . The distance to it was almost half a mile . The game of poker went on . Billy Speaker sat with his back to this opening , and after a while , in the natural progress of things , the sun crept over the top of the rock and smote him . It was a hot sun , although it was declining , and presently Billy gave warning that he was about to take off his coat . When he did so without an alarming display of hidden weapons , the fancy suspenders he wore came in for considerable attention . Now cowmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were tight enough at the waist to stay up , or they wore a leather strap to hold them . Suspenders hampered an active man . But Billy Speaker , who had originally come from Connecticut fifteen years ago , wore these braces and treasured them because his mother had given much light from her aging eyes and many stitches from her faltering needle to the embroidery that traveled up and down both shoulder straps . She had embroidered everything he could wear time and again , and at last had fallen back on the braces as something new . After free and highly critical comment regarding this particular aid to propriety , the game was permitted to go on . It happened to be Billy Speaker 's lucky day , and he had nearly cleaned the entire six of all their money and part of their outfits . In the exhilaration of raking in his gains he moved about really lively , forgetful of the brilliantly polished nickel-plated buckles that decorated his shoulder-blades and denoted the height to which his nether garment had been hoisted . Out in the bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies scouring the innumerable hogbacks for signs of their prey . There were a few more than a hundred in this body , and it represented the pick of ten ranches . At the head of it rode a stolid , heavy-faced man , who appeared as though he were in constant need of a shave , and whose features just now were drawn down into a scowl of thought and perplexity . This man 's body remained quite motionless as his horse plodded on with hanging head , but his small black eyes darted from side to side ceaselessly . It was in one of these quick glances that he experienced a blinding flash upon his retina . A second later it occurred again , and then a third time . Suspiciously the man drew his horse to a stand , and those behind him did likewise . Stelton thought for a moment that there must have been an outbreak from the near-by Wind River or Shoshone Reservation , and that the Indians were heliographing to one another . Presently , in an open space between the edges of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It probably was a tin can left by a herder  --  they often flashed that way  --  but he would prove it before he went on . He took from their case the pair of field-glasses that swung from his shoulder and raised them to his eyes . What he saw caused him to swear excitedly and order the company to back out of sight . At the same instant Jimmie Welsh , holding a straight flush , looked up triumphantly at Billy Speaker who had just raised him . He looked over Billy 's shoulder and the smile froze on his face . He continued to look , and the cards dropped one by one out of his hand . Then his face became stern and he jumped to his feet . " No more of this , " he ordered . " We 're discovered . You fellows get back out of sight , " he added to the cowmen . " Here , Harry , Bill , Chuck , search these fellers again an ' see they ai n't got nothin ' in their shoes . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked a man who had not understood the sudden change in Welsh . " I plenty wish I was , " came the reply , " but I ai n't . We 've been discovered , an ' we 've got to fight . I do n't know how many there was in the other party , but I ' low we ai n't in it noways . Red an ' Plug , you take yore horses round the butte to where the others are tethered , an ' help Jimmie and Newt bring in them casks o ' water . They ought to be back from the spring by this time . Tip , Lem , and Jack , help me put our friends here in the most-sheltered places . " In a moment the camp that had been sleepy and placid was bustling with a silent , grim activity . From secret places men produced Winchesters , revolvers , and knives , if they carried them . In half an hour all the food had been brought in , and the casks of water laboriously filled at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yuh so you seen a mirage , Jimmie , " bantered Speaker , whose ready wit and genial manner had won their way into the sheepman 's affection . " I hope so , " was the curt response . But Welsh had seen no mirage , and he was aware of the fact , knowing that a council of war was delaying the action of the other party . His chief concern was the disposal of his prisoners . Excepting for the first line of breastworks , the only protection in the flat area of the camp was derived from the masses of stone that had fallen into it , and behind which one or two men could hide . At last it was decided that the prisoners , unarmed as they were , should lie down behind the wall out of danger 's way , while the sheepmen should take their chances behind the rocks . Another reason for this was , that it would never do to have the prisoners behind the men who were doing the fighting , ready to attack from the rear at first chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a fairly good shot , not , of course , equaling the cowboys in this respect . The prisoners had hardly been placed when , from behind a neighboring hogback , rode a man waving a white handkerchief . Welsh stepped out of the camp and drove him back before he could talk , realizing the fellow 's clever idea of spying on the defenders ' position . The cowboy had little to say except to demand the immediate surrender of the cattle-owners and the delivery up to court martial of half the sheepmen . Jimmie laughed in the messenger 's face , and told him to tell whoever was boss of that outfit to come and take anything he wanted , and to come well heeled . Then he went back to the rocky camp and stood his men up in a row . " We got to keep our guests another week yet , boys , " he said . " Mr. Larkin wo n't be up the range till that time , and our job is to keep them cowboys occupied so as to hold the range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to take chances with lead can go from here now and get hung by the punchers . If there 's many of ' em I allow we wo n't see Montana ag'in till we 're angels ; if there ai n't , they wo n't see the Bar T. Now that 's the story . One other thing . " Our guests are out in front . If yuh see any of ' em actin ' funny or tryin ' to get away , put a hole in ' em an ' end that right off . Hear that , boys ? " he yelled to the cowmen who were on the ground behind the defense . " Yep , " they shouted , and continued to chaff one another unmercifully in the greatest good-humor . The old story states that the Spartans prepared for the battle of Thermopylae by oiling their bodies and brushing their hair , much to the surprise of the Persians , who were forever wailing to their gods . This story has come down to us to illustrate solid , supreme courage in the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different way , was the preparation of Jimmie Welsh and his nine sheepmen . They cracked jokes on the situation , reminded one another of certain private weaknesses under fire , recalled famous range yarns , and enumerated the several hundred things that were going to happen to the enemy during the next few hours . In all this banter the cowmen joined with their own well-flavored wit . These facts have been given to show the natures of these men who made the West ; who carved , unasked , an empire for the profit of us who live now , and who , in a space of less than forty years , practically passed from the face of the earth . Trained by their environment , they finally conquered it and left it to a more-civilized if softer generation . At four o'clock of that afternoon came the first attack . Stelton and his men were under a great disadvantage . In front of the sheepmen 's defense was a little plain some three hundred yards across which was bare of any protection . The canopy of rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was nothing for it but an onslaught in the face of a deadly fire . Suddenly from around the butte that faced the camp poured the charge of the cowboys . Instantly they scattered wide , adopting the circling Indian mode of attack . On they raced to a distance of a hundred , then fifty yards . Then , as though by preconcerted word , the Winchesters of both parties spoke , and the cowboys , turning at a sharp angle , galloped off out of range with one riderless horse , and two men , clinging , desperately wounded , to their pommels . Jack Norton , one of the sheepmen , who had exposed himself for a better shot , dropped dead where he stood . Now there was no word spoken . The helpless cowmen huddled against the wall while the hail of bullets swept over them in both directions , cursed softly to themselves , and smoked cigarettes . The punchers , having learned the lay of the land , drew off for consultation . Half of them were dispatched around the butte that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On signal , the parties from both sides charged along the face of the butte toward each other , this movement being calculated to bring them out close to the enclosure without the danger of an attack in front , and at the same time give them the chance to fire upon the sheepmen from a destructive angle at either side . The maneuver resulted in concentrating the fire within a zone of twenty-five yards , and it was fire so murderous that , before the cowboys could get out of range , ten were dead or wounded , while two of the sheepmen were killed outright and a third was disabled and rolled out into the sun to writhe in agony until his pal ran from cover and dragged him back . The result was now a foregone conclusion , for the cowboys had solved the difficult problem of attack . Mushrooming out on either side at a distance of three hundred yards , they formed again in the shelter on either side and charged once more . The wounded man , hearing the drumming of hoofs , seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat up on the ground . And from this position he emptied his gun at the yelling cowboys until another shot put him out of his misery . More cowboys fell , and now , in front of the stone breastworks , a dozen bodies lay , some twitching , and others still . The number of the defenders was reduced to five capable of holding and using a weapon , for such marksmen were the punchers that , if they did not kill outright , their bullets inflicted mortal wounds . Jimmie Welsh was undisturbed and unhurt . He and Newt were sheltered behind one rock , while Tip and Lem defended another , and Chuck Durstine held a third by the side of his dead partner , Red . The fourth charge found them lying on the ground , contrary to their former practice of standing , and they escaped unhurt , although their ability to shoot the mounted punchers above the wall was not diminished . Again they wrought terrible havoc . " I sure wish I could 've cleaned up on that straight flush , Billy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , Jimmie , " returned the other ; " yore bad luck was just breakin ' . But , look here . Suppose you fellers quit this business now . I do n't relish yore all bein ' slaughtered this-a-way , and it 's shore a comin ' to yuh if yuh do n't quit . " " Yuh talk like a Sunday-school class had stampeded on yuh , Billy . I 'm surprised ! " gibed Welsh . " Mebbe yuh do n't like yore flowery bed of ease out there , what ? " " All horsin ' aside , I mean it , " insisted Speaker . " Yuh better quit now before they come ag'in . " " Yeah , an ' get strung up to the nearest tree fer my pains , eh ? Oh , no ; I like this better ; but , of course , if any o ' the boys  --  " " Naw ! What the deuce are yuh talkin ' about ? " demanded an aggrieved voice , instantly joined by the other three . " You 're wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . If yuh 'll quit I 'll see that yuh do n't get strung up . " " You 're shore some friendly , Billy , " said Jimmie , shaking his head ; " but I could n't never look my boss in the face if I even thought o ' quittin ' . That ai n't what he pays me fer . " " I 'll give yuh a job as foreman on the Circle Arrow . I see one of you hellions got my foreman ; he 's layin ' out there kickin ' still . What d'ye say ? " " I 'm plumb regretful , Billy , " returned Welsh , without hesitation ; " but I ca n't do it . Mebbe one o ' the boys  --  " " Naw ! " said the boys in unified contempt . " Well , yuh pig-headed sons o ' misery , go on an ' die , then ! " cried Speaker , quite out of patience . " Jest a minute an ' we 'll oblige yuh , Billy , " rejoined Welsh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a tense moment of waiting , and then the fusillade began again , pitifully weak from the sheepmen . When the horsemen had whirled out of sight Lem and Newt lay groaning on the ground , while Tip O'Niell lay strangling in a torrent of blood that rushed from what had once been his face . Welsh took one look at the tortured man , and with a crack over the head from the butt of his pistol , rendered him unconscious and stilled his blood-curdling agonies . Then he walked over to the cowmen . " Anybody got the makin 's ? " he asked . " One o ' them punchers spilt mine out o ' my pocket last time . " Nonchalantly he showed the clean rent on the left side of his flannel shirt , just over his heart , where his pocket had been . Somebody handed up the paper and tobacco , and he rolled a cigarette , tossing the materials back to Chuck Durstine , who sauntered up , examining his gun curiously . Durstine , from his appearance , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bullet had grazed him , his left arm was scratched , and there were three holes in his clothes . His revolver was so hot he could hardly hold it . When they had finished their smoke they started back to their shelter , the middle rock of the enclosure . " Well , good-by , boys , " said Jimmie . " I allow it 's pretty near my turn an ' Chuck 's . " " Good-by ! " came the chorus from the owners , all of whom had pleaded steadily with the two to give up the unequal struggle . These men were hard and brave men , and they appreciated genuine grit as nothing else in the world , for it was a great factor in their own make-up . " I 'll tell yuh this , Jimmie , " called out Beef Bissell , whose conceptions had been undergoing a radical change for the last two hours , " if you an ' Chuck are sheepmen , I take off my hat to yuh , that 's all ! I never seen better fighters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ai n't dry-nursin ' a dozen cattle-owners , " retorted Welsh , amid a great guffaw of laughter . Suddenly again sounded the roar of the galloping horses . " Well , so-long , boys ! " yelled Chuck , his voice barely audible . " So-long . " The chorused response was cut short by the spitting of weapons . Chuck faced to the left , Welsh to the right . Both pumped two guns as fast as they could . Presently Chuck dropped one and leaned against the rock , his face distorted , but the other gun going . Jimmie felt a stab of fire , and found his weight all resting on one foot . Dropping their pistols , they drew others from holsters and fought on . A bullet furrowed Chuck 's scalp , and the blood blinded him so that he could not shoot . He stepped out from behind the rock , " fanning " one gun and clearing his eyes with the other hand . Three bullets hit him at once , and he dropped dead , firing three shots before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's other leg and both arms were broken , and he tumbled in a heap just as the last of the charging cowboys swept past . When they had gone there was a moment 's silence . Then : " Hello , anybody ! " called Speaker . There was a pause . " Hello ! " came a muffled voice . " Come an ' git me . I cai n't fight no more . " And with a great shout the owner of the Circle Arrow outfit ran to where Jimmie Welsh , the indomitable , lay helpless , disabled by six bullets , but still full of fight . " Stick me up on that wall , Billy , " he said faintly , " an ' put a gun in each hand . I ca n't shoot ' em , but them punchers 'll think I can and finish me . " " You go to Hell ! " remarked Speaker joyfully . " Do n't call yore ranch names , " admonished Jimmie with a grin , and fainted . CHAPTER XIX AN INDIAN COULEE By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle had crossed the ford of the Big Horn and were bedded down on the other side . When this hazardous business had been completed , Bud Larkin ordered the sheep brought up and kept on the eastern bank among the cool grass of the bottoms . The captive rustlers , under guard , were being held until daylight , when , it had been decided , they would be taken to the almost deserted Bar T ranch , and kept there until further action could be determined on in regard to them . When dawn finally came Bud looked at the stolid faces of the men , and recognized most of them as having belonged to the party that had so nearly ended his earthly career . He called them by their names , and some of them grinned a recognition . " Hardly expected to meet yuh again , " said one amiably . " Thought it might be t' other side of Jordan , but not this side of the Big Horn . " " That 's one advantage of raising sheep , " retorted Bud . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save my life . You fellows ought to have joined me in the business then . " " Wisht we had , " remarked another gloomily . " ' Tai n't so hard on the neck in the end . " Bud wondered at the hardihood of a man who , facing sure death , could still joke grimly about it . Directly after breakfast the rustlers were mounted on their horses , with their arms tied behind them , and , under a guard of six men , started on their journey to the Bar T. In charge of the outfit was a gray-haired sheep-owner from Montana , and to his care Bud entrusted a long letter to Juliet that he had added to day by day with a pencil as opportunity offered . It was such a letter as a lonely girl in love likes to get , and Bud 's only thought in sending it was to prove that she was ever in his mind , and that he was still safe and well . Weary and sleepless , Bud then prepared for the ordeal with Stelton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he learned that Indian Coulee was almost thirty miles south-east , and could be distinguished by the rough weather-sculpture of an Indian head on the butte that formed one side of the ravine . Lest there be a misunderstanding , it should be said here that this was the second day after the battle of Welsh 's Butte , as it came to be known . The first day the punchers had been busy burying the dead and attending to the numerous things to which such an occasion gives rise . It was on the morning of this day that Stelton , giving as an excuse his urgent desire to return to the Bar T , had ridden away , commanding his cowboys to remain and do their portion of the work . Late in the afternoon he had met Smithy Caldwell in a secret place , and given him a note to the leader of the band of rustlers . This Caldwell , with his usual tricky foresight , did not deliver , giving the message by word of mouth , and keeping the piece of paper as evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious to hear how the commencement of the drive fared before returning to the Bar T ranch , camped in the hills that night , and moved on to Indian Coulee the next morning to await the messenger . Just previous to starting on the long ride , Larkin called Sims to him . " Now , I 'll tell you why I want these cows , " he said . " We 've got to rush the sheep up the range . As soon as I 'm gone start ' em , but surround the sheep with a line of cows , and keep a good bunch ahead . From a distance it will look like a cattle-drive , and may serve to throw the punchers off the track if they 're anywhere in sight . " " By Michaeljohn ! That 's a good idea ! " exclaimed Sims ; " but I do n't allow either of them will feed much . " " Let ' em starve , then ; but keep ' em moving , " said Bud . " We win or bust on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those cows anyhow , to return them to their owners if possible , and you might as well make some good use of them . " Mike Stelton , meanwhile , who had often used the place as a rendezvous before , went into the usual shady spot , dropped the reins over his horse 's head , and lay down . Stelton 's heart was at peace , for the sheepmen he considered defeated at every angle . Jimmie Welsh , half dead and delirious , was on his way to the Circle Arrow ranch under Billy Speaker 's care . Consequently , it was impossible that Bud Larkin should know anything of the battle at Welsh 's Butte . Larkin would go on about his plans , dreaming the cowmen still in captivity , and the pursuing punchers on a false trail , Stelton calculated . Then he chuckled at the surprise in store for the ambitious sheepmen , for the remaining cowboys under Beef Bissell had already begun to talk of a war of extermination and revenge . When he had disposed of Larkin to his satisfaction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fifteen hundred cows well up the range by this morning . The chance of their being intercepted by the cowboys was small , and the probabilities were that they would be at the northern shipping-point and well out of the way before the punchers had finished with the miserable sheep . Two things Mike Stelton had not counted on . One was the prompt and daring action of Larkin in risking his all on one forced march up the range ; the other was the treachery of Smithy Caldwell in not burning the note according to instructions . From the first Stelton had " doped " Caldwell out all wrong . He took him for a really evil character supplied with a fund of sly cunning and clever brains that would benefit the rustlers immensely , and for that reason had warmly supported his application for membership . Somehow he did not see the cowardly streak and dangerous selfishness that were the man 's two distinguishing traits . Now , as Stelton lay in the shade with his hat over his face , steeped in roseate dreams , the weariness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard fighting oppressed him . He had been riding nights of late , and just to lie down was to feel drowsy . He would like to get a nap before the sun got directly above and left no shade whatever , but he did not permit himself this luxury , although , like all men with uneasy consciences , he was a very light sleeper . He figured that he could hear the trotting of a horse in plenty of time to prepare for any possible danger , and remained flat on his back in the warm sun , half-asleep , but yet keenly alert . Bud Larkin , sighting the coulee and Stelton 's horse at a considerable distance , dismounted and promptly got out of range . Then he continued stealthily to approach , wondering why Stelton did not put in an appearance somewhere and start hostilities . A quarter of a mile from the spot where Stelton 's horse stood dejectedly Larkin left his own animal and proceeded on foot . Nearer and nearer he approached , and still there was no sign of Stelton . Bud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse carefully , at last made out the small outline of a booted foot along the ground . Then he drew his revolver and crept forward , choosing every step with care . At a distance of thirty yards his foot unconsciously crunched a bit of rotten stone . There was a scrambling behind the rock , and a moment later Stelton 's head appeared . Bud had him covered with two revolvers , and on sight of the dark face ran forward to finish the job . But the foreman was no mollycoddle , and with one lightning-like motion unlimbered his .45 and began to shoot . Like most Western gun-handlers , his revolver commenced to spit as soon as its mouth was out of the holster , and the bullets spurted up the sand twice in front of Bud before the muzzle had reached a dangerous angle , so swiftly was it fired . But the sheepman was not idle , and had both guns working so accurately that at last Stelton drew in his head , but left his hand around the corner of the rock , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with any other man , but he still considered Larkin a " dude " and a sheepman , and knew that neither was much of a shot . With a ball through his right foot , Bud hopped out of the path of the stream of lead and discharged each revolver once at the same spot . The result was a broken hand and a wrecked gun for Stelton , who , unfortunately , did not know that Larkin , on occasions , had split the edges of playing cards with dueling pistols . Before the Bar T foreman could reach his Winchester , Bud was around the rock , and had him covered . Stelton gave one look at the hard , determined eyes of the sheepman and thought better of the impulse to bolt for the rifle on a chance . He slowly hoisted his hands . " Well , darn it , what do yuh want ? " he snarled . " First I want you to back up against that rock and keep your hands in the air until I tell you to take ' em down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . Stelton obeyed the command sullenly . Then Larkin , keeping him covered , picked up the Winchester and found another .45 in an extra holster thrown over the pommel of the saddle . Next he took down Stelton 's rope . Larkin was satisfied with his investigations . " Turn around and face the rock , and hold your hands out behind you ! " he ordered . With the wicked glitter of an animal at bay in his eye , Stelton did as he was told , and in a moment Larkin had him bound and helpless , and on the end of a tether . Still covering his man , he mounted Stelton 's horse and told him to march ahead . Illustration : But the sheepman was not idle , and had both guns working so accurately that at last Stelton drew in his head . In this manner they traveled the quarter-mile to Bud 's animal . There they exchanged beasts , and started on the long ride back to the sheep camp . " What 're yuh doin ' this for ? " stormed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Larkin in Caldwell 's place , but beginning to have a terrible fear . " Do n't you know ? " " No , I do n't . " His tone was convincing . " Well , I 'll tell you . All the rustlers are taken , and I have absolute proof that you are their leader , " replied Bud coolly . " I allow old Bissell will be glad to see you when you 're brought in , eh ? " Stelton laughed contemptuously . " What proof ? " he demanded . " A note to Smithy Caldwell that he forgot to burn . He tried to swallow it when I captured him , but I saw him first . " Stelton stood the blow well and made no answer , but Larkin , watching him , saw his head drop a trifle as though he were crushed by some heavy weight . " What 're yuh goin ' to do with me now ? " he asked at last . " Ship you under guard to the Bar T ranch , where the rest have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they come back from their vacation . " For an instant it was on Stelton 's tongue to blurt out what had happened two days previous , but an instinctive knowledge that Larkin would profit by the information restrained him , and he continued riding on in silence , a prey to dismal thoughts better imagined than described . CHAPTER XX SOMEBODY NEW TURNS UP Utterly exhausted with his day 's riding and the stress of his other labors , Bud Larkin , driving his captive , arrived at the sheep camp shortly before sundown . Faint with hunger  --  for he had not eaten since morning  --  he turned Stelton over to the eager sheepmen who rode out to meet him . Things had gone well that day with the drive , for the animals , under pressure , had made fifteen miles . The cattle , at first hard to manage , had finally been induced to lead and flank the march , but neither they nor the sheep had grazed much . When Larkin arrived they had just reached a stream and had been separated from the sheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his night watchers , and these were beginning to circle the herd . The sheep were bedding down on a near-by rise of ground . Larkin , having eaten , cooled and bathed himself in the stream and returned to the camp for rest . Shortly thereafter a single horseman , laden with a bulky apparatus , was seen approaching from a distance . Immediately men mounted and rode out to meet him , and returned with him to camp when he had proved himself harmless and expressed a desire to remain all night in the camp . It was Ed Skidmore , the photographer , who had just completed a profitable day at Red Tarken 's ranch , the M Square . Larkin , who was lying on the ground , heard the excitement as the newcomer rode into camp , and got up to inspect him . Skidmore had dismounted , and had his back turned when Bud approached , but suddenly turned so that the two came face to face . As their eyes met , both started back as though some terrible thing had come between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turning pale under his tan . " Lester ! " was all that Larkin said as he stared with starting eyes and sagging jaw at the man before him . Then , as one in a dream , he put out his hand , and the other , with a cry of joy , seized and wrung it violently . For a moment the two stood thus looking amazedly at each other , while the sheepmen , suddenly stricken into silence , gazed curiously at the episode . Then , one by one , they turned and walked away , leaving the two together . It was Bud who found his voice first . " What under heaven are you doing out here , Lester ? " he asked at last . " Earning a living making pictures , " returned the other with a short laugh . " It must be quite a shock to you to see me actually working . " " I ca n't deny it , " said Bud as he smiled a bit . " But when did you come out ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earth did n't you let me know ? I would have given you a job on the ranch . " " That 's just why I did n't let you know . I did n't want a job on the ranch . I wanted to do something for myself . I concluded I had been dependent on other people about long enough . I 'm not mushy , or converted , or anything like that , Bud , but I figured that when the governor died and left me without a cent I had deserved everything I got and was a disgrace to the family and myself . " " Same with me , Lester , " acknowledged Bud . " If you had only told me how you felt about things we could have struck out here together . " " And you with all the money ? I guess not , " and Lester spoke bitterly . " I 'd have divided with you in a minute , if you had talked to me the way you 're doing now . We always used to divide things when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's square of you , Bud , but I really do n't want the money now . I 'm making a good go of my pictures ; I do n't owe anybody , and I have n't an enemy that I know of . What have you done with your money ? " Larkin turned around and motioned toward the thousands of sheep dotted over the hills . " There 's all my available cash . Of course there was some in securities I could n't realize on by the terms of father 's will , and if I go to the wall I can always get enough to live on out of that . But my idea is to get a living out of this , and just now I am in the very devil of a fix . " " How ? " Bud narrated briefly the stormy events that had led up to this final stroke by which he hoped to defeat the cowmen and save his own fortune ; and as he did so he observed his brother closely . Lester Larkin was three years younger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weak and vacillating character . The youngest child in the wealthy Larkin family , he had been spoiled and indulged until when a youth in his teens he had become the despair of them all . Even now , despite the tanned look of health he had acquired , it could still be seen that he was by no means the strong , virile young man that Bud had become . His face was rather delicate than rugged in outline ; his brown hair was inclined to curl , and his blue eyes were large and beautiful . The sensitive mouth was still wilful , though character was beginning to show there . He was , in fact , a grand mistake in upbringing . With all the instincts of a lover of beauty he had been raised by a couple of dull parents to a rule-of-thumb existence that started in a business office late one morning and ended in a cafe early the next . It was the kind of life to which the poor laborer looks up with consuming envy , and which makes him what he thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some blocks of paper , along with sympathy and encouragement , Lester Larkin might have become a writer or an artist of no mean ability . But the elder Larkin , believing that what had made one generation would make another , had started young Lester on a high stool in his office with a larger percentage of dire results than he had ever imagined could accrue to the employment of one individual . With the high stool went a low wage and a lot of wholesome admonitions  --  and this , after a boyhood and early youth spent in the very lap of luxury . Thus , when the father died , the boy , at nineteen , knew more ways to spend a dollar than his father had at thirty-nine , and less ways to earn it than his father at nine . So much for Lester . " Well , if I can help you in any way , Bud , let me know , " he said when his brother had finished his story of the range war that was now reaching its climax . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a change . " " I do n't want you to get hurt , kid , " replied Bud , smiling at the other 's enthusiasm , " but I have an idea that I can use you somehow . Just stick around for a day or two and I 'll show you how to ' walk ' sheep so your eyes 'll pop out . " " It 's purely a matter of business with me , " rejoined Lester . " Pictures of seventy men at five dollars apiece , selling only one to each , will be three hundred and fifty dollars . I think I 'll stick . " " Suppose I get ' em all in one group so you ca n't take individuals , then what will you do ? " " I 'll make more money still , " retorted the other promptly . " I 'll sell seventy copies of the same picture at five apiece and only have to do one developing . What are you tryin ' to do , kid me ? " Bud laughed and gave up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days Bud saw more sheep-walking than he had seen since going into the business , and Lester amused himself profitably by taking pictures of the embarrassed plainsmen , many of whom would not believe it possible that an exact image of them could be reproduced in the twinkling of an eye , but who were willing to pay the price if the feat were accomplished . When he had filled all his private orders , the picturesqueness of the life and outfit with which he traveled so appealed to Lester that he made nearly a hundred plates depicting the daily events of the drive and the camp . And these hundred plates , three-quarters of which were excellent , form by far the best collection of actual Western scenes of that time and are still preserved in the old Larkin ranch house in Montana . At the end of the two days the Gray Bull River was still twenty miles away and would require an equal amount of time to be reached and crossed . During this period Bud Larkin knew nothing whatever of the fate of Jimmie Welsh and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captive , and that the punchers in pursuit were still searching the bad lands for them  --  an almost endless task . He was in a state of high good humor that his plans had carried out so well , and looked forward with almost feverish impatience to the glorious hour when the last of his bawling merinos should stand dripping , but safe , on the other side of the Gray Bull . The nearer approach to the stream brought a greater nervous tension and scouts at a five-mile radius rode back and forth all day searching for any signs of spying cowpunchers . The thought that he might effect the passage without hindrance or loss was stretching the improbable in Bud 's mind , and he devoted much time every day to an inspection of his supplies and accouterments . CHAPTER XXI JULIE INVESTIGATES The occasion when nine men with their hands tied behind them arrived at the Bar T ranch , accompanied by six others with Winchesters across their saddle bows , was an extremely happy one for Juliet Bissell . This happiness was not associated , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to do especially with the receipt of a certain smeared and blackened journal from a certain tall and generously proportioned young man . The captives arrived at noon , but it was nearly supper-time before she had finished reading , around , amid , among and between the lines , despite the fact that the lines themselves left very little doubt as to the writer 's meaning . This was not the same beautiful girl Bud Larkin had left behind him that early morning of his escape . Since that time she had changed . The eyes that had formerly been but the beautiful abode of allurement and half-spoken promises , had taken on a sweet and patient seriousness . The corners of her mouth still turned up as though she were about to smile , but there was a firmer set to them that spoke of suppressed impulses . She moved with a greater dignity , and for the first time became aware of the real worth of her mother , who until now she had somehow taken for granted . Martha 's consternation and grief at her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit of Skidmore and his camera , had been really pitiful , and the girl 's eyes were opened to the real value and beauty of an undying love . Her own misery , after the receipt of the letter brought by Skidmore , she had faced alone , and in her , as in all good and true natures , it had worked a change . It had softened her to the grief of another , and showed her , for the first time , that happiness is only really great when in sharp contrast with pain . So this long and simple love-letter from Bud , while satisfying the cravings of the lover , stirred up again the misgivings of the doubter . And her cogitations resulted in the admission that Bud must be either one of two things . Either he was absolutely innocent of the imputations contained in the letter that Skidmore brought , or he was one of the most consummate villains at large . There were grounds for both suppositions , and the girl , after hours of vain struggle , found herself still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had ever been . The arrival of Mike Stelton under guard two days after that of the other rustlers created a sensation . For the girl it was the blow that shattered another illusion , for although she had never cared for the foreman , her belief in his unswerving faithfulness to the Bissell house was absolute . Now to see him the admitted leader of the gang that had steadily impoverished her father was almost unbelievable . The man who brought Stelton in also brought a hurried scrawl to Juliet from Bud , which read : Darling : We are more than half-way up the range . Have recovered 1,500 head of rebranded stock , much of which is Bar T. Stelton is the head of the rustlers and I have the proof . Sorry to foist these criminals on the Bar T , but it was the nearest ranch , and besides , I want them there when your father comes home . Also I want to be able to tell you that I love you , and will love you always . With luck , two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your Bud . Probably the most miserable man in the whole cow country at this time was Smithy Caldwell . Aside from the fate he feared , his position among the captured rustlers was one of utter torture . The men had discovered that it was through his selfish scheming that Stelton had been betrayed , and they treated him with the cruelty and scorn of rough , savage men . So , when Stelton appeared , Caldwell fairly cringed . With the strange , unreasoning terror of a coward he feared bodily harm at the hands of the foreman , forgetting that , in all probability , his life was forfeit sooner or later . His fear was all but realized , for no sooner were Stelton 's hands unbound as he caught sight of Caldwell than he made a leap for him and would have strangled him then and there had not others pulled the two apart . " There , you whelp ! " bellowed Stelton . " That 's a sample of what you 'll get later on . All I ask is to see you kickin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traitor ! " And Smithy , clutching at his throat , staggered , whimpering , away . The day after Stelton 's arrival Juliet conceived the idea of questioning the foreman about the letter that she knew Smithy Caldwell had written her . At her request he was brought into the living-room of the ranch house with his hands tied to permit of the guard leaving them together . Now that all Bud 's prophecies in regard to the man had been fulfilled , she feared him , and one glance at his dark , contorted face as he was led in increased this fear . For his part the very sight of this sweet , quiet girl for whom he had waited so long , and through whose lover he was now doomed , brought a very eruption of rage . His lips parted and bared his teeth , his eyes were bloodshot , and his swarthy face worked with fury . " Mike , I 'm sorry to see you here like this , " said Juliet gently . " A lot you are ! " he sneered brutally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see me swing , too , I suppose ? " " Do n't talk like that , " she protested , horrified at the change in the man . " I 'm going to try to see what I can do for you , though Heaven knows you do n't deserve much . " Fury choked him and prevented a reply . At last he managed to articulate . " What do yuh want of me ? " he growled . " I want you to tell me about a letter that I received a few days ago . It was brought here by a man by the name of Skidmore , who takes pictures . " At the identification of the letter , Stelton 's eyes glittered and his mouth grinned cruelly . " What do yuh want to know about it ? " he asked . " First I want to know why you wrote it ? " " I did n't write it , " he snarled . " Well , then , why you had Caldwell write it ? " " How do you know I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could see that he was enjoying the misery he caused her . But though Juliet was humbled , she was none the less a daughter of her father , and at Stelton 's tone and manner her imperious anger flashed up . " Look here , Stelton , " she said in a cold , even tone , " please remember who I am and treat me with respect . If you speak to me again as you have this afternoon I will call those men in and have you quirted up against a tree . If you do n't believe me , try it . " But Stelton was beyond speech . All the blood in him seemed to rush to his head and distend the veins there . He struggled with his bonds so furiously that the girl rose to her feet in alarm . Then she walked to the library table , opened the drawer and took out a long , wooden-handled .45 . With this in her possession she resumed her seat . Presently the foreman , unable to free his hands , ceased his struggles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write that letter , " she said , balancing the gun , " and I want to know why you did it ? " Stelton , finding physical intimidation impossible , resorted to mental craft . " I did n't want you to love that sheepman , " he replied sullenly . " Why not ? " " Because all those things about him are true , and I thought I 'd let yuh know before yuh broke yore heart . " She searched his face keenly and had to confess to herself that he spoke with absolute sincerity . Her face slowly paled , and for a moment the room seemed to whirl about her . The world appeared peopled with horrible gargoyles that resembled Stelton and that leered and gibbered at her everywhere . The foreman saw her wince and grow pallid , and his fury was cooled with the ice of fiendish satisfaction . He could hurt her now . " Because you say so does n't prove it to me , " she managed to say at last , though she scarcely recognized the voice that came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof enough if you want it , " he snapped , suddenly taken with an idea . " You can ? " The words were pitiful , and her voice broke with the stress of her misery . " Yes . " " How ? " " Get Smithy Caldwell in here . He knew that lover of yore 's when he was n't quite such a sheepman . He 'll tell yuh things that 'll make yore hair stand on end . " In his delight at his plan Stelton could not keep the exultant cruelty out of his voice . Juliet pounded on the floor with the butt of her weapon ( this was the signal agreed upon for the removal of Stelton ) , and a sheepman almost immediately thrust his head in at the door . " Yes , ma'am ? " he inquired . " Bring Smithy Caldwell in , please , " she requested , " and tie his hands . " When the miserable fellow was pushed through the doorway and saw Stelton standing inside he shrank back against the wall and stood looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes of a trapped animal . The thought came to him that perhaps these two were already deciding his fate , and his weak chin quivered . " Sit down , Caldwell , " said Juliet , coolly motioning him to one of the rough chairs . He slunk into it obediently . " I want to ask you about that letter you sent me in which you said several things about Mr. Larkin , " she went on not unkindly , her heart going out to the wretch , so abject was his misery . " Mike here says that everything in that letter is true , and that you can prove it , " she continued . " Is that so ? " Involuntarily Caldwell looked toward Stelton for orders , as he had always done , and in those beetling brows and threatening eyes saw a menace of personal injury that indicated his course at once . " No , do n't look at Mike ; look at me , " cried Juliet , and Caldwell obediently switched his gaze back . " Are those things true ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitation . " You mean to tell me that he was married before ? " " Yes , ma'am . " " Where ? " " In Chicago to a woman by the name of Mary . She was a cousin of mine . " " Oh , God ! " The low cry burst from Juliet 's pale lips before she could recover herself , and Stelton lay back in his chair , feeding his unspeakable nature upon the girl 's torture . " Shall I tell you about it ? " Caldwell , seeing his former chief was pleased , now took the initiative . " Oh , no , no ! " she cried frantically . " I do n't want to hear . I never want to hear ! " For a few moments there was silence in the low , bare room while Juliet recovered herself . Then she said : " And about that other thing in the letter . Why are the officers after Bud ? " " For forgery , ma'am . That is , I mean , they would be after him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smithy 's countenance . " Why do n't they know everything ? " asked the girl . " Because I have n't told ' em , " was the reply . " And so you blackmailed him under threat of telling , did you ? " " Well , he seemed to be willin ' , " countered Smithy evasively , " or he would n't have paid . " " Why did you write me that letter , Caldwell ? " " The boss here told me to , " motioning toward Stelton . " What reason did he give for telling you ? " Caldwell did not like this question . He turned and twisted in his seat without replying , and shot a quick glance at Stelton , uncertain what reply was expected of him . But he got no help there . Stelton was relishing the fear and anxiety of his tool and watched to see which way the other 's cowardice would lead him . He was quite unprepared for the answer that came . " It is a long worm that has no turning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length . The pure cruelty of Stelton 's conduct revolted him , and now , sure that Stelton could do him no harm because of his tied hands , he took a vicious dig at his former leader . " He wanted to marry you himself , " he said , " and offered me a hundred dollars to write you that letter . " Stelton sat for a moment open-mouthed at the temerity of his subordinate and then leaped up with a roar like the bellow of a bull . Juliet pounded hastily on the floor , and the sheepmen appeared just as Stelton fetched Caldwell a kick that sent him half-way across the room . " Take them both away , " ordered the girl , suddenly feeling faint and ill after the mental and physical struggle of the interview . When the two had gone she sank back in her chair and faced the awful facts that these men had given her . " Bud ! Bud ! My lover ! " she cried brokenly to herself . " I want you , I need you now to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained for several minutes sunk in a kind of torpor . Then , as though she had suddenly arrived at some great decision , she rose slowly , but determinedly , and left the room . Finding one of the men , she ordered her horse saddled and retired to change her clothes . Her mother came in and asked if she were going riding alone . " Yes , mother , " replied the girl quietly . " I am going to Bud and find out the truth about him . I can not live like this any longer . I shall go crazy or kill myself . But I promise you this , that I will find father and bring him home to you . " The eyes of Martha Bissell clouded with long-suppressed tears . " God bless you , Juliet , " she said . " I ca n't live without him any longer . " CHAPTER XXII THE USE OF PHOTOGRAPHY It was noon and the great column of parched animals and hot , dusty men had come to a halt under their alkali cloud beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the usual preliminaries , lay down where they stood , relieved for once from the incessant nipping of the dogs and proddings of the men . Sims , walking among the sheep with down-drawn brows , noted their condition , how gaunt they were , how dirty and weary , and shook his head in commiseration . Had he but known it he was as gaunt and worn-looking as the weakest of them . Returning to where Larkin had dropped in the shade of the cook-wagon , he said : " We 've got to make it to-night if the Old Boy himself is in the way . " Larkin realized the seriousness of the situation . Water and feed were plentiful , but owing to the hurry of the drive the animals were starving on their feet . Less than five miles away was the Gray Bull River , the goal of their march . Once across that and they would be out of the Bar T range and free to continue north , for the next ranch-owner had gone in for sheep himself ( one of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gladly granted Larkin 's flocks a passage across his range . " What I ca n't understand is where all those cowpunchers are , " continued Sims . " I 'm plenty sure they would n't let us through if we was within a foot of the river , they 're that cussed . " He had hardly got the words out of his mouth when from ahead of the herd appeared a horseman at a hard gallop , quirting his pony at every few jumps . Pulling the animal back on its haunches at the cook-wagon , the rider vaulted out of the saddle and was blurting out his story almost before he had touched the ground . " Up ahead there ! " he gasped . " Cow-punchers ! Looks like a hundred of ' em . I seen ' em from a butte . I ' low they 've dug fifty pits and they 've stuck sharp stakes into the ground pointed this way . They 're ready fer us , an ' do n't yuh ferget it . " Sims and Larkin looked at each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had plenty of reason for not molesting them ; they had been preparing a surprise . " An ' that ai n't all , boss , " went on the rider . " I took a slant through my glasses , and what d'yuh suppose I seen ? There , as big as life , was old Beef Bissell an ' Red Tarken , and a lot more o ' them cowmen . How they ever got there I du n no , but it 's worth figurin ' out of a cold winter 's evenin ' . " This information came as a knockdown . The two men questioned their informant closely , unable to credit their ears , but the man described the ranch-owners so accurately that there was no room left for doubt . " Then what 's become o ' Jimmie Welsh and his nine men ? " asked Sims wonderingly . " Mebbe they 're captured ; but I could n't see anythin ' of ' em . " " Nope , " said Bud slowly , " they are n't captured . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I picked them for that job because I knew how they would act . Poor boys ! If I get through here alive I 'll put a monument where they died . " He ceased speaking , and a sudden silence descended on all the company , for the other men had been listening to this report . Each man 's thoughts in that one instant were with Jimmie and his nine men in their last extremity at Welsh 's Butte , although the site of the tragedy was as yet unknown to them . " What about the lay of the country ? " Sims finally asked of the scout . " Dead ahead is the big ford , but that is what the punchers have protected . I could see that either up or down from the ford the water 's deep , because there ai n't no bottoms there  --  the bank 's right on top of the river . " " Where is the next nearest ford ? " " Ten miles northeast , this season of the year , " was the reply . " Thunderation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sims petulantly . " Call Lester , and we three will talk it over , " said Bud , a half-formed plan already in his mind . Presently the three were alone and discussing the situation . Bud proposed his scheme and outlined it clearly . For perhaps a quarter of an hour he talked , interrupted by the eager , enthusiastic exclamations of Lester . When he had finished , Sims lay back on his two elbows and regarded his employer . " If yuh keep on this-a-way , boss , " he remarked , " I allow we might let yuh herd a few lambs next spring , seein ' yuh will learn the sheep business . " Bud grinned at the other 's compliment and noted Lester 's enthusiasm . Then they plunged into the details . " Better ride your horse around by way of the ford ten miles away , " were the instructions as Lester saddled up . " Then you can come at ' em by the rear . " No word of young Larkin 's intention had passed about the camp , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , placing it to Bud 's fear of his receiving an injury in the trouble that was almost surely bound to happen that night . At three o'clock in the afternoon , or thereabouts , Lester , with his outfit strapped on his dejected horse , rode slowly away from the sheepmen 's camp . Meanwhile , behind the various defenses that had been erected against the coming of Bud Larkin and his animals , the cowmen and their punchers were making ready for their night 's battle . The chief actor in these fevered preparations was Beef Bissell , whose hatred of Larkin was something to frighten babies with at night . Since the gallant battle at Welsh 's Butte , Bissell had changed some of his ideas regarding sheepmen in general ; but he had changed none regarding Larkin in particular . It was now a matter of pride and determination , almost of oath with him , to fight this matter of the range to the finish . The other cowmen stood by him out of principle and because of the need of a unified stand by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ditch , ready to sacrifice men , animals , and money , wrong and knowing it , these beef barons prepared to dispute the last inch of their territory . It should never be said , they had sworn , that sheep had crossed the cattle-range of any of them . On this elevating platform they proposed to make their fight . To be perfectly just to all concerned , it is only right to add that all who did not choose to remain , either owners or punchers , were perfectly free to withdraw , but in doing so they forfeited their membership in the association . But one man had taken advantage of this  --  Billy Speaker . " If there 's any damage to be done , those sheep have already done it . Why do n't yuh let ' em through , yuh ol ' fat-head ? " said Speaker to Bissell as , with his cowboys , he threw his leg over the saddle and started homeward . Despite the havoc to their numbers occasioned by the battle with Jimmie Welsh , all the others stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its hazards was a decided improvement over the dangerous monotony of spring round-ups . Moreover , as long as one remained able to collect it , five dollars a day was several pegs better than forty dollars a month and all found . To-day as the late sun drooped low toward the horizon revolvers and guns were being oiled , and other preparations made for a vigorous campaign . The camp backed directly on the river at the only fordable spot within ten miles , the stream forming the fourth side to a square , the other three sides of which were breastworks of earth and trenches . A rope stretched from the three cook-wagons served as a coral for the horses , and in it were gathered fully sixty-five animals , waiting impatiently to be hobbled , and turned out to feed . They waited in vain , however , for it was a matter of course that they should stand saddled and ready for instant use . Directly before the front of these earthworks were the pits and chevaux de frise of sharp stakes that had been reported to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , and run them into the pits and upon the stakes while a force of men , protected by the trenches , poured a withering and continuous fire into the on-surging mass . Meanwhile the greater force on horseback would be engaging the sheepmen . That the cowboys knew the location of the flocks goes without saying , for had they not had spies on the lookout , the telltale pillar of dust that ever floated above the marching thousands would have betrayed their exact position . The sun had just dropped below the horizon , when a man in the cowpunchers ' camp discerned a weary horse bearing a hump-shouldered rider disconsolately in the direction of the ford . The man , bore strange-looking paraphernalia , and could be classified as neither fish , flesh , nor fowl  --  that is , cowboy , sheepman , or granger . Without pausing the man urged his horse into the water at the ford , where it drank deeply . The man flung himself off the saddle and , scooping the water in his hands , imitated the horse 's eagerness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up at the man across the river and said : " Say , could I git some grub in yore camp ? " " Yuh better move on , pardner . This here 's resky territory , " replied the other , his Winchester swinging idly back and forth across the stranger 's middle . " I 'm hungry enough to take a chance , " was the reply as Lester walked his mount deliberately across the stream . " Besides , I want to do business with yuh . " Another man , hearing the controversy , came up and ordered the newcomer away . Lester asked him who he was . " My name 's Bissell , " snorted the man . Lester advanced the rest of the way to shore his hand outstretched . " I 'm plumb glad to know yuh , " he said . " My name 's Skidmore , an ' I 've just come from the Bar T. I take pitchers , I do  --  yessir , the best in the business ; an ' if yuh do n't believe me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddle-bags Skidmore whipped out two photographs and handed them to Bissell . There , looking at him , sat Martha , in some of her long-unused finery , and Juliet , the daughter who had until now been the greatest blessing of his life . Bissell started back as though he had seen a ghost , so excellent and speaking were the likenesses . " Yes , they asked me to come an ' take one of yuh , Mr. Bissell , " went on the photographer . " They did ? " snapped Beef suspiciously . " How 'd they know where I was ? " " Stelton told ' em . I was there when he got home . " " Oh , yes  --  Stelton , of course , " apologized the owner . " How d'ye take the blame things ? With that contraption yuh 've got there ? " " Yes , and I think there is still light enough for me to get you ! " cried Skidmore , snatching his outfit from the back of his horse and starting hurriedly to set it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of whom had never seen a camera in operation , and none of whom had seen such pictures as Skidmore was able to pass around . Bissell posed with the embarrassed air of a schoolboy saying his first piece , and after that Skidmore was busy arranging his subjects long after it was too dark to make an impression on the plates . Finally , affecting utter weariness , he asked for food , and the best in the camp was laid before him . " Ca n't do any more to-night , " he said when he had finished . " But to-morrow I can take a few ; I have about half-a-dozen plates left . " " I may not look as tidy to-morrow morning as I do now , " remarked one puncher suggestively . " Too bad yuh ca n't take pictures at night as well as in the daytime . " " I can , " announced Skidmore , quite complacently . " Well , did n't yuh just tell me , " demanded an irate cowboy who vainly undertook to grasp the science of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate made the pitcher ? " " Yes . " " Well , how in the road to hell can yuh take ' em when it 's dark ? " " He rents a star , yuh fool ! " volunteered another . " I make my own light , " explained Skidmore . " How ? With a wood-fire ? " asked the curious puncher . " No . Shall I show yuh ? " " Yes . " The reply came in a chorus , for the arrival of this man with his strange apparatus had created a stir among his hosts that one can not conceive in these days of perfect pictures . The cowpunchers were not worrying about attack , for they had outposts on duty who could warn them of the advance of the enemy in plenty of time . The amusement of the camera was a fine thing with which to pass the lagging hours . " All right , " said Skidmore . " By George , " he cried , " I 've just the idea ! My plates are low , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What ! Get seventy men on the same thing that 'll only hold one ? " cried another puncher , furious that these wonders eluded him . " If yuh 're foolin ' with me , son , I 'll shoot yer contraption into a thousand pieces . " " Easiest thing in the world , " said the photographer carelessly . " Only I 'll have to ask yuh to move away from the fire ; that 'll spoil the plate . I think over here is a good place . " He led the way to a spot directly in front of the horse corral . Then he caused the lowest row to sit on the ground , the one behind it kneel , and the last stand up , and after peering through his camera made them close up tightly so that all could get into the picture . By the glow from the camp-fire it was a wonderful scene . The light showed broad hats , knotted neckerchiefs , and weather-beaten , grinning faces . It glanced dully from holsters and brightly from guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged his flashlight powder and took the cap off the lens . Then he ran to the fire and picked up a burning splinter , telling them all to watch it . " Steady , now ! " he commanded . " All quiet . " He thrust the lighted spill into the powder , and there was a blinding flash , accompanied by a hollow roar like a sudden gust of wind . The next instant a terrific commotion arose in the corral . There were squeals of terror , and before the men could catch their breath the sixty-five cow ponies had bolted in a mad stampede , overturning the cook-wagons and thundering across the prairie . The punchers , absolutely sightless for the instant from looking at the flash of the powder , broke into horrible cursing , and ran blindly here and there , colliding with one another and adding to the already great confusion . Their one desire was to lay hands on the wretched photographer , but that desire was never fulfilled . For Lester Larkin , having shut his eyes during the flash , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse that had been tethered to a tree near the river . With his instrument under his arm he untied the animal , climbed on his back , and dug in the spurs . A moment later , during the height of the confusion , he was galloping along parallel to the river . A mile and a half from the camp he turned his horse 's head and sped at full speed toward the advancing herds . CHAPTER XXIII THE CROSSING Darkness had scarcely fallen over the Larkin flocks and herd when the former were set in motion . The bells had been removed and the sheep were urged forward at the fastest possible pace . Riders going by long detours had found a spot on the banks of the river two miles up from the camp of the cowmen where the water was not more than five or six feet deep at most , though of considerable swiftness . It was here that it had been determined the sheep should cross . So , when the last march was begun , the animals were driven at an angle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingenuity . The herders , some of them on horseback and others on foot , did not speak . The only sounds that rose from the densely packed flocks were the clatter of their hard feet on the earth , the cracking of their ankle bones , and an occasional bawl of protest . But even this last was rare , for the sheep , worn with fast traveling and ignorant of the meaning of the strange things that were happening to them , were half-frightened ; and only contented flocks blether much . Bud Larkin and Sims rode back and forth , one on each side of the dim , heaving line , seeing that the herders and dogs kept their places and preventing any tendency to bolt . An hour after the start half the distance was accomplished . It was just at this time that Larkin , looking northeast toward the camp of the cowmen , saw a sudden brilliant flash of light , and knew that Lester had succeeded in his daring project . A moment later and the distant rumble of the earth told him of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ponies Larkin had accomplished a master-stroke , for he had played upon the one weakness of their equipment . A cowboy without his horse is less effective than a seal on land . His boots , tight-fitting and with high heels , make walking not only a difficult operation , but a painful one . Unaccustomed to this means of locomotion , a puncher is weary and footsore within two miles . Aside from this fact , a cowboy disdains setting his foot on the ground except in a cow town , and even there daring ones sometimes rode their animals into saloons and demanded their drinks . It is a saying that a puncher will chase his horse half a mile in order to ride a quarter of a mile on an errand . The coup of Lester Larkin had , therefore , left the camp of the cowmen in serious straits . Afraid to chase their animals and leave the camp deserted , as soon as they recovered enough sight to recognize their surroundings they took their places in the trenches to carry on their defense as best they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty of getting his sheep safely across the river , his mind occasionally flashed back to the rear of the flock where the cook-wagons were trailing , for there in the company of a friendly sheepman rode Juliet Bissell . Only that afternoon she had left the Bar T ranch-house , and , directed by one of the men guarding the rustlers there , had set out to find the sheepmen 's camp . Not realizing how fast the outfit was traveling , she had struck the trail far to the rear , and had not overtaken Larkin until just at the time when the sheep were set in motion . Then she realized her mission would have to wait until a later time . But so sweet and full-hearted had been Bud 's joyful greeting that her faith in him had again returned , and she rode along meekly where he placed her , fond and comforted . The proprieties of the situation never occurred to her . She knew that she was safe in his hands , and only bided the time when she could pour out her sorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To Bud her coming had been inexpressibly sweet . He knew by her face that some great necessity had driven her to him , but he did not question her , and with the undisturbed security of a clean conscience he wondered anxiously what had occurred . At the time when the sheep were half-way to the river-bank there was another movement back at the camp where the cattle had been left . Men there working on schedule started the cattle-drive . But this drive was not at any diverging angle . It led straight forward to the pits and sharpened stakes of the cowmen 's defenses . Presently the outposts of the force by the ford heard a distant rumbling of the earth . These men on their horses  --  for they had not been in camp at the time of the flashlight  --  rode slowly forward and waited . But not long . Nearer and nearer came the sound until there was no more doubt that an animal-drive was headed in their direction . Slowly they retreated to the camp and gave the warning . Immediately the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their misfortune , loaded every available weapon , breathing a hot and complete vengeance against the men that had outwitted them . Much to their chagrin they now recognized that Skidmore was but a clever member of the enemy , for if he had not been they felt that he would not have accomplished such a speedy and well-planned escape . Now , as the sheepmen drove their animals nearer and nearer to the pits , they urged them faster until the unhappy creatures , besides themselves at the weird occurrences of a night of terror , were at a headlong gallop . Suddenly one of the punchers heard that unmistakable accompaniment of running steers and the clashing of horns as the animals with lowered heads charged the works . " They 're cows ! " he yelled . " Do n't shoot ! " But it was too late . The maddened cattle were already at the first pits , plunging in with terrified bellows , or being transfixed on the stakes by the onrush of those behind . The pits were not more than ten feet deep , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then those following trampled over their dying companions and charged the trenches where the cowboys lay . " Fire ! " yelled Bissell , who was in command , and the guns of nearly seventy men poured a leaden hail of death into the forefront of the heedless cattle . Larkin 's men by this time had drawn off to see that the havoc ran its course , and when they heard the desperate volleys they turned and rode southwest along the river-bank to the point where the sheep expected to cross . The cattle , which had been driven in a rather narrow column , continued to come on endlessly . The leaders dropped in windrows , but the followers leaped over them only to fall a little farther on . Driven by the resistless impulse of these behind , the animals unconsciously appeared like a charging regiment . Nearer and nearer the tide approached the cowboys ' defenses ; but now it was coming more slowly because of the dead bodies and the wounded animals that dragged themselves here and there , bellowing with pain and terror . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns the last of the steers dropped , and the few that remained alive turned tail and fled wildly back the way they had come . In front of the trenches was a horrible tangle of trampled , wounded creatures , rearing as best they could and stabbing one another with their long , sharp horns . " Everybody out an ' kill the ones that ai n't dead ! " yelled Bissell , and the cowboys leaped over the breastworks on this hazardous errand of mercy . " Where are the sheep ? " was the question every man asked himself and his neighbor , but no one could reply . It had been reported to Bissell by the scouts that with the sheep were a body of cattle . Consequently when the steers charged all had expected the sheep to follow . But in all that grisly battle-field there was not a head of mutton to be found , and the punchers looked at one another in mystified wonder . " They must be crossin ' somewheres else , " said Bissell , wringing his hands in despair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " The thought was in every man 's mind , for here the beauty of that strategy was made manifest . Uninjured , full of fight , and furious , the forces of the cowmen were helpless because they had nothing to ride , and were utterly useless on foot . Two miles away on the bank of the river another scene was being enacted . Here the eight thousand sheep had come to a halt with the leaders on the very bank , and the herders walking back and forth talking to them to keep them quiet . The river was not more deep than the height of a man , but the current was swift and icy with the snows of the far-off Shoshone Mountains . " Are you ready , boys ? " sang out Larkin . " All ready . " " Strip and into it , then , " and , the first to obey his own command , he hurried off his clothes and plunged into the frigid river . Sims , who had devised this scheme from memory of an Indian custom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossing . Now the men entered the water by tens , and stretched out in a double line all the way from bank to bank , facing each other and leaving but a scant yard between them . " Ready ? " yelled Sims . " Ready ! Let ' em go ! " sang out Larkin . The chief herder and others heaved the leading sheep into the water between the first two men . These lifted it along to the next pair who shoved it on , swimming all the time . So it came snorting and blatting to the other side and climbed up the bank . After it came the next , and then the next , and as the work became easier the sheep caught the notion that man had suggested and incorporated it into the flock mind . They took to the water because their predecessors had . And now the stream of sheep was steady and continuous . The current was swift and the men 's bodies ached and grew numb in the intense cold , but they stood their ground . Only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and here they lost a few terror-stricken animals who turned aside from the chain and were swept downstream . The river between the men was churned like that of a rapid ; there was heard the constant slap-slap ! of their arms as they smote the water in pushing the sheep along . A man took cramp and clung to a companion until he could kick it out of himself . At last , though , all the sheep had passed over the river , and Bud Larkin had won ! Then came the getting over of the wagons and camp outfits , all done in the dark , and with scarcely sound enough to be heard a furlong away . As some men worked , others dressed and swam the horses over , leading them in bunches . Presently , dressed , happy , and glowing with the reaction from his icy bath , Bud Larkin appeared out of the dark beside Juliet Bissell . " You are the one who has enabled me to do all this , " he said gently . " Now , will you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your father two miles away ? " She looked up at him proudly . " To the victor belongs the spoils , " she said , and lifted her face to him . " Are you going to make me go ? " " Darling ! " he cried in the sweet , low voice she loved and drew her to him . CHAPTER XXIV THE STORY OF LESTER Bud 's sleep of exhaustion was ended by the sound of voices calling to one another . So deep had been his unconsciousness that as he slowly struggled back to light and reason he forgot where he was and what had happened . One thing was certain , the sun had been up a long while , and it was growing extremely hot even under the sheltering cottonwood tree where he lay . The voices continued to call to one another , and Bud finally sat up to investigate . On the opposite bank another camp was being made by bow-legged men who wore heavy chaps over their trousers , broad hats , and knotted neckerchiefs . Some of these men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toes as they went about the business in hand . A short distance away from where Bud sat some of the sheepmen were lying comfortably on their elbows , chaffing the punchers . " I allow you cowmen 're gettin ' pretty swell , " remarked one . " They tell me yuh kinder hanker after photygrafts of yerselves . How about it ? " " Better lose a hoss fer the sake of yer good looks than be a comic valentine all yore life , what ? " was the drawling retort . " Mebbe so , but if I 'd lost hosses the way you fellers did last night I would n't have enough vanity left no ways to look a pony in the left leg . I 'd go to raisin ' grasshoppers to sell to old ladies ' chicken ranches , I plumb would . " At this sally such a guffaw of laughter greeted the discomfited punchers that they retired from the field for the time being . Larkin grinned with the rest . Then he turned his attention to the little tent set up near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept there and wondered if she were awake yet . He called her name and presently a very sleepy voice responded , so tender and helpless in its accents that he laughed for joy . " Lazy girl ! " he cried . " Do you know what time it is ? I 've been up for hours . " " All right ; I 'll get up , I suppose . Is breakfast ready ? " " Not quite , " he replied seriously , " but I 'll have the maid bring it in as soon as the eggs are shirred . " " Bud Larkin , you 're horrid ! " she cried . " I do n't believe you have even started a fire . Do you expect me to get your breakfast ? " " It would tickle me silly , " he confessed , unrepentant . " Shall I wait for you ? You see the cooks are getting dinner now . Breakfast was over hours ago . " " Oh , dear , I suppose so ! We 're not even married and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Well , " he said , relenting , " I 'll get things started , but you come out as soon as you can . " So saying he beckoned to Ah Sin who had been waiting for the boss , and gave him a number of orders . Then he thrashed about the river bank as though looking for fagots , while Julie continued pretending to mourn over her hard lot . When at last she appeared , however , and had dashed the sleep from her eyes in the icy waters of the river , it was not to cook , but to sit down at one of Ah Sin 's little tables and eat a glorious breakfast . " You perfect darling ! " she cried happily and ran and kissed Bud though the Chinaman was looking on . During breakfast she noticed the work going forward on the other side of the river and asked Bud about it . " The cowmen moved their camp down here opposite us as soon as they could find out where we were , " he explained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several matters . I 'm pretty sure I have a thing or two to say to them , now that I am out of their clutches . " " Oh , then my father must be among those men . " " He must , although I have not seen him . I intend to take you over to him immediately after breakfast . " Suddenly for the first time , the girl 's face clouded ; through their sweet bantering pierced the hideous visage of the thing that haunted her and that she had come to ask him about . " Talk to me a little while first , will you ? " she pleaded . " You know I came to see you for a special reason last night but had no time to discuss it then . " " Certainly , dear girl , " he replied . When they had finished eating they strolled a little way up the noisy stream and finally found a cozy nook between two trees . All about them in the succulent grass of the banks and river bottoms they could hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sims had determined to rest his animals for a few days before starting again the long trek north . " Bud , " she began , speaking slowly so as to choose her words , " I am going to ask you questions about things that you have never chosen to discuss with me for some reason I could not fathom . If it is unmaidenly I am sorry , but I must ask them . I can not stand any more such anxiety and pain as I have suffered in the last few weeks . " Bud 's features settled themselves into an expression of thought that told the girl absolutely nothing . " Yes , go on , " he said . " First I want you to read this note , " she continued , drawing a soiled bit of paper from the bosom of her dress . " A photographer called Skidmore was held up by the rustlers and asked to bring it to the Bar T and give it to me . " Her hand trembled a little as she held the paper out to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he smiled his old winning smile at her and kissed the hand she had extended . " Lies ! All lies ! " he said . " Please think no more about them . " She looked at him steadily and withdrew her hand . " That wo n't do , Bud , " she replied firmly , but in a low voice . " What is the thing for which Caldwell blackmailed you three years ago and again this year ? " Bud looked at her quizzically for a moment , and then seemed to recede into thought . She waited patiently , and , after a while , he began to speak . " Yes , I suppose you are right , " he said . " It is a woman 's privilege to know what a man 's life holds if she desires it . There are but a few rare souls who can marry men against whom the world holds something , and say : ' Never tell me what you were or what you have done ; what you are and what you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your place , I am sure I should do what you are doing , for I have always told myself that those who marry with points unsettled between them have taken the first step toward unhappiness . Suspicion and deceit would undermine the greatest love that ever existed . Acts in the past that can not be explained create suspicion , and those in the present that are better unobserved father deceit . " He paused for a few moments , and appeared to be thinking . " Do you know who that Ed Skidmore is ? " he asked abruptly . " No ; only he was quite nice , and evidently from the East . " " He is my brother Lester , and he is the man who stampeded the punchers ' horses last night with his flashlight . " " He is ? I should never have suspected it ; you are absolutely different in looks . " " I know we are , or I should n't have risked his life last night . Well , I bring him into this because I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always a wild youth , particularly after the governor stuck him on a bookkeeper 's stool and tried to make a business man out of him . The boy could n't add a column of figures a foot long correctly inside of ten tries . I took to the game a little better than he did , and managed to get promoted occasionally . But Lester never did . " Father believed , and announced often enough , that anybody that could n't add figures and keep accounts had no business to handle money . To discipline Lester , who he thought was loafing when he really was incapable , the governor cut off the boy 's allowance almost entirely and told him he would have to live on his wages until he showed he could earn more . " Well , Julie , you know what kind of a cad I was back in the old days  --  rich , spoiled , flattered by men , and sought after by women . ( I can say these things now , since I 've learned their opposites ! ) Just try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order on Lester , who was always the petted one of us two because he was small and delicate ! It was like pouring cold water on a red-hot stove lid . " Tied more than ever to his desk , Lester wanted more amusements than ever . But he had only about fifteen a week where he had been accustomed to five times the amount . He drifted and borrowed and pledged and pawned , and finally was caught by some loan-sharks , who got him out of one difficulty only to plunge him into three others . " Although my father had a narrow-gauge mind as far as life in general is concerned , I will say this for him : that he was right in everything he did about business . He had made it a rule of the firm that anybody who borrowed money was fired on the spot . Lester knew this , and , while he would have liked nothing better than the sack , he did not want to disgrace the governor before his employees and all the business world . So he clung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I must confess that I think some of the blame for what followed should be laid at my door . I had been patient with the kid and loaned him money until I came to the conclusion that it was like throwing it down a well . Then I got fond of a certain person "  --  he paused a moment and smiled at Julie  --  " and I needed all my money to entertain her properly ; so I quit loaning . " I do n't know whether to tell you the rest or not ; it is n't what I would want anyone else to tell you , even about a perfect stranger , but I think it is right you should know everything if you know anything . " The girl nodded without speaking . " In the loan-shark office was a very pretty little girl , and Lester thought he fell in love with her . She had a red-headed cousin and an admirer named Smithy Caldwell , who belonged to a tough gang on the South Side . " The girl was fond of Lester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends as he ordered her to , and they quarreled . Her name was Mary , and after the fuss the three friends , together with the loan-shark people , played Lester for a gilt-edged idiot , basing their operations on alleged facts concerning Mary . In reality Smithy Caldwell had married her in the meantime , and Lester eventually proved he had always treated her honorably , though now she denied it . " " Poor , innocent boy in the hands of those blood-suckers ! " cried Juliet compassionately . " Naturally driven frantic by the fear of exposure and the resulting disgrace of the whole family , the boy lost his head and tried to buy his persecutors off . And to do this he took money out of the safe . But what 's the use of prolonging the agony ? Finally he forged my father 's signature , and when the check came back from the bank he tried to ' fix ' the books , and got caught . " I 'll pass over everything that followed , except to say that the disgrace did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hastened his death . When that occurred it was found that practically all the estate had come to me , and this fellow Smithy Caldwell threatened to disclose the forgery if I did not buy him off . " That scared me , because I was now the head of the family , and I handed over two thousand dollars . Then I came West , and thought the whole matter was buried , until Caldwell turned up at the Bar T that night for supper . " That 's about all . You see , it 's an ugly story , and it paints Lester pretty black . But I 've thought the thing over a great many times , and ca n't blame him very much , after all , for it really was the result of my father 's stern and narrow policy . The boy was in his most impressionable years , and was left to face the music alone . It seemed to age him mightily . " " But what will happen now ? " asked Julie anxiously . " Are n't the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , but I do n't think they will . I have the drop on Smithy now , and he will either write a full dismissal of the matter for all three of them or he will swing with the rustlers . And if I know my Smithy Caldwell , he wo n't be able to get pen and paper fast enough . " " But can you save him , even at that cost , do you think ? The cowmen wo n't understand all this . " " That will rest with your father , dear , " replied Bud , getting to his feet . " Now , let 's go over and see him , for I have something else I want to ask him . " His face that had been clouded during his recital was suddenly flooded with the sunlight of his smile , and Julie realized for the first time what it had cost him to lay bare again these painful memories of a past he had sought to bury . When he had helped her to her feet she went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up into his face with eyes that brimmed with the loosed flood of her love , so long pent up . " Can I ever be worth what I have cost you to-day ? " she asked humbly . Tenderly he gathered her to him . " In love there is no such word as cost , " he said . CHAPTER XXV THE THREADS MEET It could not have been later than ten o'clock in the morning when a puncher with sharp eyes might have seen two figures approaching the Bar T ranch house on horseback . They rode needlessly close together and swung their clasped and gauntleted hands like happy children . One was a girl into whose radiant eyes a new wonder had come , and the other a handsome , tanned young man bathed in a deliriously happy expression . " Is n't it jolly to be married without anyone 's knowing ? " cried Julie . " Oh , but wo n't they be surprised at home ? " " Rather ! " remarked Bud , with a sobered expression . " I only hope your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yard with the olive branch . " " Stop it , Bud ! What puts such awful thoughts into your head ? " " Experience . Your father was so mad about my getting the sheep across the river that he started his punchers walking home that same night , and nobody has seen him since . " Larkin spoke the truth , but little exaggerated . Beef Bissell , humiliated , beaten , and forced to accept the small end of a deal for once in his life , had started from the useless cowmen 's camp by the Gray Bull the very night of the crossing . He ordered the men to follow and round up their stampeded horses and then to ride home . Meanwhile he appropriated one horse that had not been in the corral and trotted homeward , eaten by chagrin and beside himself with impotent fury . Bud and Julie had found this out the day of their talk concerning Lester , when they forded the stream on horses and asked for Bissell . Under the circumstances Bud developed a genius for inspiration that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of riding all the way home and having a grand row with your father ? " he asked . " Why not go over to Rattlesnake , where there 's a sky-pilot , and be married ? Then we 'll go home , and there ca n't be any row , because there will only be one party in the mood for it . " But the girl demurred . It was cruel to her father and mother , she said , not to have them present on the greatest day of her life . She allowed it was mighty ungrateful after all they had done for her . Then Bud took her hand in his and told her his principal reasons . " I 'm a business man , honey , and I 've got to start north after Simmy and the sheep in three or four days , " he said . " Shearing is late now , but I guess we can make it . This trouble has set me behind close to fifteen thousand dollars , and everything is in a critical state . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as soon as we get on our feet we 'll take a honeymoon to Japan that will make you think I 'd never heard of a sheep . " You want your mother and father in on the joy , I know , but it does n't seem to me there can be much joy with nine or ten men sitting around waiting for their necks to be stretched . Does it to you ? " " No , " said Julie , and shuddered . " Then come along over to Rattlesnake and be married . Then we 'll ride back to the Bar T , so you can see your folks , and I can see Caldwell . We can be through and away before anything is really done about the rustlers . " So it was arranged , and the two were married by an Episcopal clergyman who had a surplice but no cassock , and whose trouser-legs looked very funny moving about inside the thin , white material  --  and Julie nearly laughed out loud . After the ceremony they had ridden out of town with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool , green place beside a little brook that had trout in it and sang to them for hours on end . Now , the day afterward , they were on the way home , and not without a few secret misgivings . As they neared the Bar T a single man rode out to meet them . It was Lester , who had come the night before and was waiting for Bud , so as to be present at the interview with Smithy Caldwell , whom he had not yet seen . He congratulated the pair warmly and rode with them to the corral . Suddenly there was a shriek , and Martha Bissell tore out of the cook-house . She ran to Julie , kissed her , and welcomed her back ; then when she heard the news she picked up her apron to start crying , and dropped it again , undecided what to do . What with Bissell 's safe arrival and Julie 's glorious home-coming the poor woman was nearly out of her mind . The excitement brought Beef Bissell around the house from the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning . At sight of Larkin he halted in his tracks and began to redden . But he got no farther , for Julie flung herself into his arms , tears of happiness streaming down her face , and overwhelmed him with caresses . Bissell was mightily relieved to see her . In fact , it had been all his wife could do to restrain him from starting out to unearth Julie when he arrived home and found her gone . But Martha said that the girl had gone to find Larkin , and added that the two were old enough to settle their troubles between them . So Bissell , remembering his last miserable interview with his daughter , decided not to interfere . " Father , I 'm married ; please be happy and good to me , " the girl said , clinging to him , and the fury that had flown to his head like wine died a natural death . After all , to see her happy was what he most wanted . " Are you sure he will love you always ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I refused to marry him long ago in Chicago . " He kissed her for the first time in a long while , and then gently disengaged himself and took a step toward Bud . " Larkin , " he said , " yuh were always lucky , but yuh 've beat all records for Wyoming now . I allow yuh can take her away with yuh on one condition . " " What 's that ? " " That yuh never beat her like yuh beat me . " " Agreed ! " laughed Bud , and grasped the other 's hand . " But can you stand a sheepman in the family ? " " I sure can , Larkin . Ever since I seen Jimmie Welsh and his men fight , I ai n't got anythin ' against sheepmen . " " Jimmie Welsh ! " cried Bud . " Tell me , did any of his party come through alive ? " " Jes ' Jimmie himself ; the boys could n't kill him , so he 's over at Billy Speaker 's mendin ' up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen yuh to explain why he 's still alive . " " Good old Jimmie ! " said Bud , the tears leaping to his eyes . " Dearest , " he added , turning to Julie , " there 's one more stop on our honeymoon , and that 's at Billy Speaker 's to-morrow . " Bissell continued the conversation , and asked for the full story of how Bud had run down and captured the rustlers , saying that the whole cow country owed him a debt , and if they had only known of the capture in time would have let his sheep through without protest . " I imagined as much , " remarked Bud ; " but I did n't care to get them through that way once I had started the other . I hope , Mr. Bissell , that we can be friends , although we have been enemies up to now . I 'm sorry I had to sacrifice those cattle of the association , but there was no other way out of it . " " I 'll tell yuh this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can beat me at anything is good enough to be my friend fer life , an ' I 'm here to state that yuh could count my friends of that type , before you came , on the hairs of a hairless dog ! " Bud laughed , they shook hands again , and peace was finally made between them ; but not until Beef Bissell had signed away half of the interest in the Bar T to Julie as her dower . That was a happy and hilarious dinner at the ranch . Some of the cowboys coming in at noon from near-by ranges heard of the marriage and cheered the bride lustily when she appeared on the veranda . Bud made himself solid with the disgruntled punchers by walking out to them and talking over the battle of Welsh 's Butte , while he rolled cigarettes and smoked them one after another . Shortly afterward , Bud and Lester found themselves in a room with Smithy Caldwell . The blackmailer , when he saw Lester , fell down in a faint , so great was the shock to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrible condition both from physical fear and the tormenting by his comrades . He started at every slight sound , whirled about fearfully to meet any footfall that sounded near , and trembled with uncontrollable nervous spasms . To both the Larkins he was a piteous sight , and Bud wondered that the miserable creature had not gone mad . The wretch fell on his knees and pleaded with them for his life , so that when Bud put the proposition squarely up to him that he forswear everything in regard to the Larkin family , he could not accept it eagerly enough . " But about the papers that you said were in Chicago ? " asked Bud . " I lied about them , " replied Smithy . " They 're sewed in the lining of my shirt . Give me your knife and I 'll get ' em for you . " " Give me your shirt and I 'll find them , " countered Bud ; and he presently did . Together the brothers looked them over . Every bit of incriminating evidence was there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a great sigh : " Thank Heaven , that 's over ! " He did not let Caldwell off , however , without securing from him the written and signed statement that he wanted . When all was done they let him go , and now his mind was almost as unbalanced by joy as it had formerly been by fear . Bissell , knowing Caldwell 's condition , had agreed to his being released on clearing his account with the Larkins , for he realized that the man , in fearing death , had suffered the penalty a thousand times , and that the memory would remain with him through life , and perhaps help keep him straight . Shortly after Bud and Lester had joined the others on the veranda again , a sudden scream was heard from the bunk-house , followed by the sounds of a terrible struggle . All hands rushed around to the rear and , with drawn revolvers , forced an entrance among the sullen rustlers . On the floor in the middle of the room lay Smithy Caldwell , white and contorted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making sounds in his throat like a wild animal . Smithy was dead . " How 'd it happen , boys ? " asked Bissell . " This here Caldwell come out an ' ' lowed as how he was n't goin ' to swing like the rest of us , an ' he began packin ' up his truck . Stelton asked him about it , an ' when Smithy repeated what he said before and got plumb cocky about it , Mike there smeared him plenty . Then he broke his neck . Smithy betrayed Stelton , yuh know . " There is not much more to tell , except that , three days later , the rustlers paid the penalty of their lawless daring . It was the biggest " hangin ' bee " Wyoming had ever seen , and was largely attended by men of all sections who stood for right and justice , if not law and order . Bud and Julie brought pride and sunlight to a slowly recuperating Jimmie Welsh on their way north , and from him and Billy Speaker heard again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go to Welsh 's Butte , you will see a tall white shaft rising amid the tumbling of the wretched hogbacks . On one side are the names of the sheepmen who fell ( including Jimmie , who is still alive ) , and on the other those of the cowmen . It is the humble offering of Bud and Julie Larkin . Time has proven that Bud 's prophecy in regard to sheep was right . Wyoming has far more sheep than cattle now , and one of the biggest of the ranches is the former Bar T , run under the Larkin name , in connection with the home ranch in Montana . I hope it will not be a shock to some readers to know that the first Bud and Julie have another Bud and Julie , who are over twenty years of age , quite old enough to have romances of their own . All their lives they have heard the story of the adventures that brought their parents together , but all four rather sadly admit that the Free Range , which Bud fought for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , that the great drives have passed never to return , and that the cowboy himself is a dim figure against the prairie sunset .
