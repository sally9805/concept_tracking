THE diversions of a chewing-gum camp are not numerous , especially in the dense forests of Quintana Roo , near the center of the peninsula of Yucatan . Sign o r Miguelo , our considerate host at Esmeralda , named them over a visit to a lake among the hills , a bit of hunting with the dogs , a look at a cut stone in the forest , a ride through the savanna or reedy plain bordering Lake Chichankanab , and the cutting of a bee-tree . He saw that although I was interested in them all , the cut stone appealed to me most ; and as my time was limited he thoughtfully offered to send and fetch it . That , however , was far from my desire ; we would ride out the first thing next morning and see the stone where it lay . In the full light of a tropical morning , with the dew still on the leaves , we rode through the unfelt air of the even-tempered , shady forest . When the machetes of the Mexicans had cleared the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile or so , we reached the top of a small ridge overlooking Lake Chichankanab . There lay the stone , a little , insignificant piece of limestone only a foot in diameter , but carefully smoothed and squared by human hands . After a glance at it I went to the mound close by , from which it had clearly fallen , but which Signor Miguel() had failed it , to inter-tion . He seemed surprised at my est in t , but volunteered the information that there were hundreds of such mounds in the forest . Where ? Oh , everywhere ; he saw them on every hunting trip . When one of our attendants had chopped away the vines , I found that the mound measured about sixty-five feet by thirty-five . Clearly there once stood here a solid structure in the usual style of ancient Yucatan , a series ofrooms roofed with pointed arches , ending in flat capstones instead of keystones . The stones of both the inner and outer sides of the walls were carefully smoothed and fitted , and those on the corners were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ninety feet by fifty-five , and others were located all around . Signor.Miguelo conducted us to the end of this particular group of ruins . We followed a winding forest trail made by chiclerN , or gum-gatherers , on their way to find zapote-trees . In spite of underbrush so dense that small mounds are hidden at a distance of twenty or thirty feet , we saw at least twenty-five mounds in the space of a scant mile . Manifestly , if the vegetation were cleared away , hundreds would be in sight . Among those that we saw the great majority were small structures , probably houses ; but a few of larger size appear to have been temples and sacrificial pyramids . The ruins closely resemble those in the jungle region farther north , save that here in the forest they are smaller and less magnificent . All this may perhaps seem unimportant , but it raises a great question . To-day , as has been shown in a previous article , the dampness of the forest , its equable temperature , its fevers , and its over-exuberant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but by the Mexicans or the Spaniards . Nowhere under similar conditions has any modern race succeeded in really overcoming more than a few small spots in the tropical forest as distinguished from the tropical jungle . Yet the ancient Yucatecos , one or two thousand years ago , must have cleared and cultivated great areas of what is now dense forest , not only here in central Yucatan , but in regions farther west and south , such as Palenque , with its wonderful carvings , in the State of Chia pas . A few days after our discovery of the ruins of Esmeralda we returned northward to the railroad . Leaving the train at Tekax ( Tekash ' ) , we undertook to visit some of the well-known ancient cities of northern Yucatan , famous for their architecture and carving . We meant to hire mules or horses for a ride of five days , ending at Uxmal ( UshmH1 ' ) , one of the three or four most wonderful ruins in America . From six o'clock in the morning , until nearly noon , Felipe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding only one little horse , and that could be hired merely for a single day . In despair we called on the jefe politico , or mayor , but all he had to say was : " This matter is most difficult . Why did n't you bring a letter ? You ought to have sent word days ago . I will tell the chief of police to make in-quiries , but you are in a hurry . What can we do ? Why did n't you go to Muna or Ticul , where tourists often go ? " Out on the street once more , we met a squint-eyed youth who agreed to drive us five miles to Chac-multum in a spring-less , two-wheeled farm-cart , for the sum of $3.52 Mexican money . Thinking that we might he able to get mules at a plantation on the road , I sent the cart to the railroad station for our baggage . " Do n't forget the hammocks , " was my last word to Felipe as they started off ; and , " Where are the hammocks ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot them , " was the answer , which I had learned to expect , " but remembered them only a block from the station , and this stupid driver would n't go back unless I paid fifty cents more . " I stood by Felipe as a matter of principle , and the driver stood our for an extra fifty cents . The deadlock lasted for an hour or more , while I wrote several pages of notes , and thirty or forty people talked several volumes . Then , being ready to go , ordered Felipe to bring up our one little horse , on which I purposed to hunt for the ruins alone . The sight of active preparations for departure so excited the recalcitrant driver that he ran off and summoned two policemen to arrest me for not paying $3.50 according to agreement . In the heated argument that followed I could not get a hearing at first , and in order to stop the clatter of the driver I laid a hand on his shoulder ? not forcibly , but firmly . A great hubbub at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the police that I had been guilty of violence , and the police seizing me by the arms . I told Felipe to tell the police that it was evident from their faces that they were intelligent men , that they could see for themselves that I had not been violent , and they could further see that the driver was an ass . If there was to be any further discussion I would talk only with the police captain and then with the mayor . When I spoke of their intelligence , they at once became aware of it , and drew themselves up with a look of conscious superiority as they went off to see the captain . That was the last that we saw of them . The driver began to fear that he would get neither fifty cents for driving a block nor $3.50 for driving five miles . He was willing to compromise . He would get the hammocks , but on foot , not in the cart . I told Felipe to go with him , that there might be no mistake . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had walked , the driver had kicked his heels in the shade , and another youth , his representative , had ridden my hired horse and earned the hammocks . I paid $3.50 ; nevertheless I am still doubtful as to who came out ahead . This silly little incident delayed us till 3 P.M. , but it gave an interesting side-light on the character of the mestizos , or half-breeds , who form the bulk of the townspeople of Yucatan . A ride of five miles , fearfully rough in the cart , but very pleasant on horseback , brought us to Chac-multum , a splendid ruin hidden in the jungle . I do not intend to describe this ruin , or the others still more wonderful that I saw during the next few days . One finds them everywhere in the jungle-covered portion of Yucatan , and a considerable number are located in the dense forest . Nowhere have I seen ruins which impressed me more strongly with a sense of the ability of the builders , not even in Greece . A colloquial remark inscribed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York admirably sums up the impression they produce upon any one of intelligence : " I think that , after all , we are not so smart . " The intricate patterns carved upon scores of temples and palaces vary most interestingly . At one extreme are massive geometrical designs made of rectangular stones jutting out from the face of lofty walls . Another type consists of numerous columns , some small and purely ornamental , and others large enough to form colonnades . A third type of adornment consists of huge stone serpents , strange forms of bird and beast , or distorted human heads set with great teeth . The culmination of the ancient Yucatecan art is reached in carefully modeled busts , like the two heads , lately exhumed , which stand side by side at Kabah . They are genuine portraits in spite of the crudity which impresses one at first sight . The plaited hair of these two men and the high tiaras are not particularly remarkable , although carefully executed , as can be seen in the photograph . The thing which rivets attention is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in outline , but with wider , more tropical nostrils ; the curved lips , and the sparse , drooping mustaches . Before one has time to analyze the eyes his attention is diverted by the curious chain which in each case encircles the left eye , falls down over thecheek , and is brought up to the chin . From the statues I turned to our guide , a Maya Indian , and saw the same features repeated in brown , living flesh . Our driver also had the same hooked nose , wide nostrils . and drooping mustache . The chief difference was in a lesser curvature of the mouth . So well did the old masters work a thousand , or , some say , ten thousand , years ago that although we know nothing of the origin or affinities ' of the race to which they belonged , we can at least affirm that in spite of mixture with foreign elements their blood still flows in Yucatan . The originality , variety , and delicacy displayed in the carvings are not the only features which make us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The abundance , size , and solidity of the structures are no less remarkable . At Chichenitza , where within a radius of twenty-five miles on either side there are probably to-day not five thousand people , there once was a vast city . Mr. E. H. Thompson , whose home has for years been directly among the ruins , says that the area of dense urban population was at least six miles square ; that is , it comprised no less than thirty-six square miles , while beyond it lay extensive suburbs . Such a city , even if it had but two families to the acre , would have contained fully 230,00o people ; whereas all Yucatan to-day has a population of only a little over 300,000 . Chichenitza , however , by no means stands alone . Ninety-two ruins are known , according to Mr. Thompson , and many of them must have been towns of large size . Otherwise they could not possibly have possessed the wealth and surplus labor requisite for the construction of temples such as that of Labna , 375 feet long and three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score of notable ruins lying close together within fifteen or twenty miles of Uxmal . I dwell on these matters in order to emphasize the fact that the ancient Yucatecos were a civilized and prosperous race , blessed with a large amount of surplus wealth which they could use to support the architects , sculptors , painters , and engineers who superintended the building of the temples and evolved the myriads of ideas which were everywhere brought to fruition . There was also wealth to support the thousands upon thousands of workmen who quarried the rock , carried it to the buildings , hewed it to the exact dimensions demanded by the plans of the masters , or burned the lime with which an army of masons cemented the hewn stones . Elsewhere men were toiling to lay smooth , paved roads from town to town over the rocky , hillocky plain ; while others must have been building and repairing the innumerable cisterns or reservoirs which alone enabled a large population to dwell in this riverless , springless land of underground drainage . Still larger bodies of men must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely raises more than enough for his immediate needs , and his wife can not comprehend the value of grinding to-morrow 's corn to-day or yesterday . The present hand-to-mouth methods can scarcely have prevailed in the past , for then there must have been a large surplus supply of food , which by barter or taxation was available as a store to support the nonagricultural artisans and laborers . At what time these conditions prevailed no man can tell . Various authorities have ascribed to the ruins an age of from one to eleven thousand years . These figures are based on data derived from calendar stones preserved in many places both in Yucatan and in neighboring regions such as Mexico and Guate- mala . The stones can be deciphered with considerable accuracy , and exact dates can be assigned to the construction of many buildings . The only trouble is that the dates belong to the various local eras of the different countries , and no one knows when a single one of the eras began . This ignorance affords an ample field for speculation . There are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back a long time before the coming of the Spaniards . Two of the strongest of these reasons are that when the Spaniards came to Yucatan , early in the sixteenth century , the Mayas , in the first place , were a slow , mild , unprogressive people , utterly different from the wide-awake , progressive race which alone could have built the ruins ; and in the second place they made no claim to any knowledge or even any tradition as to the origin of the wonderful structures among which they dwelt . Probably the present Mayas are the descendants of the builders of the ruins , although perhaps largely mixed with other invading elements from the north-west ? that is , from Mexico . By the sixteenth century of our era , however , they had utterly degenerated from the vigor and originality of their ancestors , and were apparently much more different from them than the modern Greeks are from their ancestors in the days of Plato and Phidias . The modern Yucateco does not begin to have the energy and initiative of the modern Greek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his predecessors were the equals of the Greeks or any other race so far as real achievement is concerned . I know that this is a sweeping statement , and 1 shall return to it later . Here it is enough to point out that the Greeks borrowed much of their culture from their neighbors ; the Yucatecos , so far as we can learn , had no one from whom to borrow . The Greeks had at their command the accumulated store of knowledge and of tools from half a dozen great nations ; the Yucatecos had only their own culture and their own crude tools to rely on . Each ofthese two nations i was great because it was full of new ideas . We know the ideas of the Greeks not only art of conserving water had been lost . Such degeneration in the most vital of human concerns , together with the absence of traditions , seems to imply a long lapse of time since the ruins were in their glory . Nevertheless , the best modern authorities believe that the most modern ruins were built no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall well within the Christian era . Thus in only a thousand or fifteen hundred years the Mayas have utterly degenerated . In the past they could challenge comparison with the civilizations of ancient Egypt and Assyria or with the Mycenaean Greeks . Today they are nothing . Whatever may have been the date of the Yucatecan civilization , there can be no doubt of its greatness . The measure of a nation 's greatness is found by dividing its achievements by its opportunities . We Americans , according to our own opinion , have achieved greati things , but in view of our opportunities it may be that we have been no more successful than the ancient Yucatecos . Let us attempt to sum up the achievements of that race . In the first place they developed a system of art and architecture which need not shrink from comparison with that of Egypt , Assyria , China , or any other nation prior to the rise of Greece . Secondly , they appear to have developed a system of roads which made communication much easier than it would he to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly advanced system of water-supply. iron , the days be- fore the discovery of ron , deep wells could not be dug , and primitive people , as we have seen , could live nowhere except close to the deep caverns of the cenotes . Yet the main ruins have nothing to do with cenotes . They are often miles from them , and are located in places where the only modern water-supply comes from wells i so to 250 feet deep . Another evidence of high achievement is found in the size of the cities . People who could live in such vast numbers and could carry on such great public works must have had a highly organized and effective social and political system ; otherwise chaos would have reigned . And finally these old Yucatecos were on the point of taking one of the most momentous steps in human progress . They had developed a genuine system of hieroglyphics , and were beginning to evolve real writing ? that is , the use of a definite character to represent a definite sound , instead of a character for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they are , have never taken . In a word , the ancient Yucatecos were brimful of new ideas ; and in the last analysis ideas are the cause of human progress . It is possible , to be sure , that the seeds of some of these ideas , such as hieroglyphic writing , came originally from the eastern hemisphere . As to this we have no positive evidence , but one thing is sure : even if certain ideas did come originally from other sources , they were completely assimilated and worked over into new forms in Yucatan . Before they reached the stage of development recorded in the ruins they had been in Yucatan so long that the style of architecture , the type of art , and many other characteristics had become saturated with features peculiar to that particular part of the world . At the most the people of Yucatan can not have borrowed from other nations a tithe as much as is borrowed by all modern nations , or even as was borrowed by the Greeks . If any race ever worked out its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn back now to the other factor in the equation of a nation 's greatness ? the opportunities which serve as the divisor of the achievements . Of the outward helps which we modern nations deem necessary to great accomplishments the Yucatecos had practically none . One good thing they had , as we have seen in a previous article ? a country which is capable of raising abundant crops and supporting a large population , but which will not do this without careful and laborious tillage . Of other natural advantages , at least of those commonly recognized as such , they had almost none . We have already emphasized the fact that Yucatan had no neighbors from whom she could gather suggestions , or who would stimulate her by example or immigration . The nearest approach to any such thing was in the neighboring regions of Central America and Mexico , but none of these places equaled Yucatan , and most of them appear to have been her imitators rather than her examples . Two other matters are even more important than the relation of Yucatan to her neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of iron tools in pre-Columbian days . Think how the Yucatecos must have toiled in carrying on their backs the stones , mortar , and beams of their buildings ? Yet this did not check their work . They had no hesitation in transporting stones eight or ten feet long , although this must have required laborers by the score . Moreover , all the food of the people , not merely that of the farmers , but that of the city people and of the thousands of workmen engaged in building the structures whose ruins we see , had to he brought in on the backs of human animals ? a task which only a nation full of energy and resolution would or could accomplish . Yet the absence of beasts of burden , important as it was , was a small matter compared with the absence of iron . We are told sometimes that the ancient Americans had tools of hardened copper , but this is pure theory . We have never found an ounce of such copper , and we do not know how it could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we do not see how the ancient people could have done such clever work without some such material . We fail , however , to appreciate the fact that tools of obsidian or flint can be made of great delicacy by a people who have sufficient skill , energy , and patience . In these last words we come once more to the crux of the whole matter . ' These clever people , to whom Providence had given neither an animal fitted for a beast of burden nor yet the happy accident of the discovery of the use of iron , nevertheless took the crude tools at their command , and by the constant application of energy , and by the steady flow of new and original ideas , were able to arrive at a stage of civilization which was probably higher than that arrived at by any other race with no larger opportunities . Their achievements undoubtedly fall far behind those of Greece , and still more , perhaps , behind those which modern machinery now makes possible ; but their opportunities were few . They used the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubled and doubled again . This brings us face to face with the problem of why this ancient race was blessed with such great activity of mind and energy of body ? No one can solve it as vet , for many and diverse factors doubtless contributed to the result . All that I can do here is to suggest a way in which the conditions of life as represented in my own particular branch of study may have been more favorable in early days than at present . Writers on Yucatan sometimes suggest that the country could not formerly have supported so vast a population had not the rainfall and the agricultural possibilities been greater . Others deny this . They say ? rightly , I think ? that an industrious and energetic people who had the energy and brains to construct wells and reservoirs could now cultivate almost every foot of Yucatan proper except for the numerous spots where the bare rock actually comes to the surface . One can ride for days over plains of the richest soil , deep , soft , and easy to cultivate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reason is largely the difficulty of digging wells or building reservoirs for water during the dry season . The rainfall at Merida , in the driest portion of Yucatan , averages about thirty-two inches per year , falling mostly in the months from June to October , which period has twenty-four inches . This is not a large amount , but it is more than the eastern United States gets during the same period , and is sufficient to allow good crops of corn to be raised almost everywhere . Lack of rainfall seems to have nothing to do with the present comparative depopulation of Yucatan , as is evident enough from the fact that the densest population is found in the driest part of the peninsula . In fact , as has been pointed out in our previous discussion of the jungle and the forest , a i small rainfall is a distinct advantage , because it prevents the growth of the great tropical forest which so effectively checks human progress . The only kind of climatic change that would have a ravorable effect in stimulating human progress in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of jungle at the expense of forest , and would perhaps make agriculture more difficult than now , or one which would cause more frequent cold waves . A change which increased the area of jungle and made agriculture somewhat harder in the regions where it is now practised would obviously act as a stimu-lant . People would have to work harder and take more forethought in order to get a living , but they would still find no great difficulty , provided they were energetic . The other kind of change might be even more important . Again and again I inquired of all sorts of people as to the kind of weather during which the modern Yucatecos work most vigor-misty . The universal answer was , on " fresh " days ? which means the coolest days that Yucatan ever enjoys . When I put this question to Mr. Thompson , he answered it as every one else did , and then with characteristic energy went out early the next morning to interview some of the Wise old men whom he knows among the Indians . They , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blink- ing it over a little more , they added : " Yes , the Mayas work hardest when there is a fresh spell , but not just when it is raining . The morning after a rain is the time . Then the air is cool and clear , and the women bake the tortillas much more quickly than usual , so that we get away to work early . " Nothing , as we have said , is ever prepared to-day for to-morrow , and so in the morning the men always have to wait until the women have ground some corn , mixed the batter , and cooked some thin tortillas on a flat sheet of iron . Therefore the husbands , not being able to depart until the day 's supply of bread is ready , take especial note of the speed with which it is prepared . Perhaps this may seem a trivial matter to mention in connection with a great problem like that of the cause of the rise and fall of nations ; but there is surely much importance in a thing which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exception only j of hunger . One of the surprises of my journey to Mexico and Yucatan was the discovery that evidences of climatic changes are as abundant there as in regions farther north . At Mexico City three different kinds of deposits , indicating respectively a dry period , a moist one , and again a dry one , have been excavated by Professor Boas , of Columbia University , and found to contain the remnants of three different types of civilization . Farther south , in the State of Oaxaca , in latitude 17 ? N. , great terraces of alluvium seem to indicate changes of climate during recent times . And finally the various ruins found in the dense tropical forest imply either that the ancient Yucatecos were not merely a very clever people , but a people more clever and able than any existing race , or else that climatic conditions were drier , so that in former days jungle predominated in areas now covered by forest . All this seems to indicate that formerly the earth 's various zones of climate were pushed southward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i belt which now prevails in the northern United States was pushed toward the Southern States , and the belt of deserts which in general prevails at about latitude 30 ? was pushed down toward the equator . Just how the changes worked we do not yet know , but apparently they caused the jungle of Yucatan to spread into areas now occupied by forest , and at the same time they much increased the number of storms , or " northers , " as they are commonly called . Such a double change would be highly advantageous to the development of civilization . In the first place , it would enlarge the area within which agriculture is feasible , and would make agriculture in all parts of the country difficult enough so that those of the primitive inhabitants who were not blessed with energy and the power of assimilating new ideas would find it impossible to get a living . In. the second place , it would increase the amount of stimulation which is derived from frequent changes of temperature and other climatic conditions . These two favorable conditions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yucatecos of long ago a highly inventive , industrious , and progressive race . Other factors were no doubt also involved , and will some day come to light . If we could picture to ourselves the exact conditions under which the ancient people of Yucatan rose to a place among the great races of the world , we should have the key to a momentous question : the cause of the rise and fall of nations .
