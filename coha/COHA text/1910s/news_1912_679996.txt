txt A schedule of demands ror Increased wages for railroad firemen on fifty railroads east of Chicago and north of the Ohio and Potomac Rivers , involving , according to railroad officials , an increased expenditure of between $25,000,000 and $80,000,000 a year , was sent yesterday by W. S. Carter , President of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginernen , from Peoria , Ill. , to J. C. Stuart , Chairman of the Conference Committee of Railroad Managers , which met in this city recently to cons:der the demands of the Brotherhood of Railroad Engineers , whose threatened strike was narrowly averted by the intercession of the Federal authorities with a proposal of arbitration , to which both sides have since agreed . With the demands of the engineers still unsettled , added s'gnificance is given to the demands now made by the firemen of the same roads . According to one official of the railroads , rivalry exists between the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen . The former will receive into its membership only engineers . The latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post of engineer still retains them in its membership . In this way , it was sa'cl , each organization has come to vie with the other in making Its benefits as attractive as possible to members . When the Brotherhood of Engineers issued its recent call for members to vote on the proposed strike the call concluded with a reminder to members that " the prestige of the organization is at stake . " This , the railroad managers believed , had reference to the efforts of the rival organization to win members ; and it was not unexpected that this organization , in turn , should presently come forward with demands for increased wages rivaling the demands of the engineers . Affects at Least 20,000 Firemen . The engineers demand an increase of 18.3 per cent . This will be considered shortly by a board of arbitration of seven . Daniel Willard , President of the Baltimore &; Ohio Railroad , has been appointed a member of the board by the railroads , and P. H. Morrissey , formerly head of the trainmen 's organization . ha , s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose the remaining five arbitrators , or , if they fail to agree , the arbitrators will be chosen by Chief Justice White of the United States Supreme Court , Justice Martin A. Knapp , and United States Commissioner of Labor Neill . Just what disposition will be made of the new demands Just received from the Brotherhood of Railroad Firemen and Enginemen could not be learned yesterday . Chairman Stuart of the Committee of Managers of the Railroads acknowledged receipt of the demands , and assured Mr. Carter that he would be glad to call his committee together and put the demands before it , advising Mr. Carter of the result later . The communication from the President of the firemen 's organization , besides asking for increased wages , had demanded concerted action by the railroads instead of the individual action now obtaining among the fifty railroads concerned . In this way the firemen now hope to have wages standardized for all the roads . Their organ izatlon includes workers on 24,084 locomotives , which means that there are at least 20,000 firemen among its members , exclusive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the different wage scales now existing on the various roads concerned , it was said at the headquarters of the Committee of Railroad Managers yesterday that it would be impracticable to compare the existing and proposed wages item by item at this time . The Scale Demanded . The demands include , however , a scale of from $2.50 to $2.70 a day on passenger engines , $2.85 to $4 a day on through freight service , $2.60 a day of ten hours or less on switching service , and from $2.50 to $3.75 a day of ten hours or less for hostlers . On Mallet type engines , when used in pusher or helper service , firemen under the new scale would receive $3 a day of sixty miles or less or of ten hours or less . No fireman would be required to fire for more than s'x hours or sixty miles in any twenty-four-bout period . Ten hours or less or 100 miles of less is to be considered a day 's work in all classes of service except as otherwise Specified . All mileage in excess of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for at mileage rates , and all mileage or time made after the ten-hour period Is to be paid for on a basis of time and one-half , or on the basis of one mile for each four minutes if the ' miles exceed the hours worked . The most important of the changes demanded , however , as the railroads v'ew it , is embodied in Article XIV . of the de-mands : " On coal-burning locomotives in freight service a fireman and an assistant fireman shall be employed . " There are now 14.609 coal-burning locomotives in the freight service of the railroads affected at present , and under the existing system there is but one fireman on each locomotive . The new demand would involve the employment of at least 14,609 additional men as assistant f'remen , or a total expense , according to the railroads , of between $14.000,000 and $16 , - 000,000 additional per annum . Another important change proposed by the new schedule is contained in Article XII. : " Firemen shall be relieved from clean Rig of engines , tanks , fires and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smoke arches . and front encla . " This , according to one official of the ' - allroad Managers ' Committee , would practically necessitate the employment of valets " for the firemen to do work now regularly done by firemen . No intimation of the official attitude of the Committee of Managers toward the demands of the f'remen , however , could be obtained yesterday , nor any expression of opinion as to whether these , too , would be submitted to arbitration . These demands , according to Mr. Carter ' communication to Chairman Stuart of the Managers ' Committee , were prepared by a committee representing the employes , which met in Chicago on Feb. 15 . They have Fence been voted upon and Indorsed by the members of the organization .
