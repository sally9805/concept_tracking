txt Mirabeau L. Towns , the lawyer , told the Thompson legislative committee yesterday of receiving $5,000 from the Interborough Rapid Transit Company for arranging conferences , between President Theodore P. Shouts of the company and Mayor William J. Gaynor in the negotiations over the then proposed subway extensions , and how he swayed the Mayor from a plan of municipal ownership to favor the Interborough plan . Mr. Towns insisted that he had done much more than merely to accompany Mr. Shonts to St. James . L. I. , in the Spring of 11110 and wait in an automobile while Mr. Shouts had a three-hour talk with the Mayor . He likewise denied that there was ever anything sinister , ulterior , or immoral in his dealings with the Interborough . The committee also heard T. H. Gillespie . Vice President of T. A. Gillespie &; Co .. the firm which got the $12,000,000 contract from the Interborough for third tracking the elevated lines on a basis of $2,000,000 profit . Mr. Gillespie appeared in answer to a subpoena , but he refused to turn over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a branch firm in Pittsburgh . Senator Thompson ten  --  mediately -- gbt into touch with - District Attorney Swann . but later decided toask the Senate to summon the recalcitrant witness before it . Thompson to Plead for Time . After the committee had examined 3 . Aspinwall Hodge in regard to the Admiral Realty Company 's suit to test the Constitutionality of the dual subway contracts , and a number of witnesses in regard to the price the Interborough Company pays for its cold . the committee adjourned until Wednesday next . In the meantime Senator Thompson will go to Albany and endeavor to obtain an indefinite extension of time in which to continue his investigation . *Whle he is away the sub-committee will continue its examination of the Interborough 's books in an effort to find out just how many items the Public Service Commission allowed the Interborough to charge to its " . Prior Determination " account , which the city must pay . The committee believes that all the bonuses given to Interborough officials were put into this account and allowed by the commission . The refusal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat upset the committee 's plans . The witness took the stand with a bundle of papers . supposed to contain the records of the transfer of money from the New York to the Pittsburgh offices of tile company . " I am perfectly willing . " said Mr. Gillespie , " to answer any questions about transactions . between our New York office and our Pittsburgh office , but I will not allow your accountant . Mr. Morse . to go through them . " " I direct you td.Thand those papers to this committee . " said Senator Thompson . " I shall not , on the advice of my , counsel . " replied Gillespie , putting the Papers into his pocket . " I want you to understand . " said Frank Moss , counsel to the committee . " that this committee knows what it is doing : In your previous testimony you admitted that the money was transferred to Pittsburgh during the third tracking of the elevated lines . That admission makes these papers germane to the purpose of our inquiry . We desire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To Charge Contempt . The statement had no effect upon the witness . Senator Thompson again requested him to . hand over the papers , and again ' Mr. Gillespie refused . Let a transcript of this be made , " said Senator Thompson . " I will tell ' you , " saig . ' Mr. Gillespie , " that during two . years our New Yak office sent 1514,000 to Pittsburgh and received $335,000 in return . " " That is not what we want , " replied Senator Thompson . 1 . You are testifying as you choose . What we want Is the papers , the " record in the case . " The Senator then went to -a telephone and talked to District Attorney . Swann , who promised to examine the records ' and determine . what action he should take . It was then announced that the committee would take Mr. Gillespie before the bar of . thei Senate on-a charge of contempt . In his testimony Mirabeau L. Towns said he first met Mr , Shonts in Deceriiber , 1909. but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Interborough from . October of that year . " What was the occasion of your meeting- Mr. Shunts ? ' r asked Frank Moss . " We met to discuss the ' plane of the , Interborougli ; to . extend the subway system . . " - " Did'you meet . ' hini . freguently , litter Yes replied : , gr , Towns:My 1 recollection of my connection with the Interborough goes back to'October , 1909 , and from the time I met Mr. Shonts we had many conversations , first concerning a. campaign against the tai-borough system and afterward as to what should be done to favor the proposition of not having the city become a competitr of the Interborugh in . the subway business . I never demanded or received any retainer . " " Did you introduce Mr. Shonts to Mayor Gaynor ? " Mr. Moss wanted to know , taking up the visit to St. James . " I was present , " said the witness . " Did you introduce them ? " Gaynor and Shoats Both Anxious . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobile and I think they recognized each other . I did not get out . ' " Did you go with Mr. Shonts to St. James for , the purpose of meeting Mayor Gaynor ? ' Mr. Towns said he had arranged for meetings before that , but because of engagements of either one or , the other these meetings did not take nlace . " Did you fix the time for this meeting ? " " I think they did . I simply communicated the time to each . " " - Were you requested by Mr. Shonts to arrange this meeting ? " " I think so . but I ca n't say . I know they were both anxious to meet each other and to clear up this subway situation . " " When Mr. Shonts was on the stand , " said Mr. Moss , " he gave us the impression that he did n't know you very well . " " Well , " replied Mr. Towns , " I am not particularly familiar with Mr. Shonts . " " He seemed to have forgotten you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought he was a man of large affairs and- " " But he said that he just took the bull by the horns , and you say that the meeting was all arranged . " " Well , I do n't want to make it too strong . " said Mr. Towns . " but I should say they were both anxious to meet each other . I wish to say that the impression 1 got from the testimony of Mr. Shonts was that I received $5.000 for going down there with him . I want to say that I worked hard from October to May for that. - " And what was that work ? " Argued Against Competition . Mr. Towns paused a moment and then slowly replied : " Conveying to Mayor Gaynor the desires of the Interborough . Mr. Gaynor had written an article denouncing the scheme of the railroad to set up a monopoly of the transit business . I had some knowledge of the situation , and my purpose was to convince Mayor tia.ynor that his premises were wrong . I tried to convince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to have competition with the Interborough . On the question of routes there were many suggestions , and as they came up , would go over the matter with him . " " Whom did you report to ? " " At first to Mr. Campbell . Mayor Gaynor was my friend . I had had charge of the case of Duffy against Bingham . which resulted in making Mayor Gaynor a , prominent candidate for the Mayoralty . Mr. Moss asked the witness if he remembered the suggestion that the East River tunnel be named the " Gaynor Tunnel , " and Mr. Towns smiled . " Yes , " he said . " That was one of the arguments I used . I tried to show him that it would be better to confer a great benefit upon posterity rather than to nurse an unreasonable grouch . " " And the naming of the tunnel the Gaynor Tunnel ' wag one of the benefits to posterity ? Did you overcome the opposition of Mayor Gaynor ? " " I do n't know , " replied Mr. Towns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , but I did all I could and the results speak for themselves . " " And you got only $5,000 ? " " I received that about two years after my services ended . " " How long after you saw Mr. Shonts was this visit to Gaynor made ? " Towns 's Bill Cut in Half . " I could fix the date exactly if I had known that I was to be called . I recall there was snow on the ground . Mr. Shonts fixes the time in April . 1 always thought there was snow on the ground . It was in 1910 . I should say it could be fixed by the railroad . " " And you received only $5,000 ? " " That is every cent , covering fees and disbursements , that I received . He asked me how much I wanted and I told him how much my services were worth . He told me to send in a bill . I sent a bill for $10,000 and received a check for $5.000 , and I signed a receipt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had any dealings with the Board of Estimate regarding the matter . He replied in the negative ; that his services were confined to going to Mr. Gaynor and to Mr. Shonts . " You : deed between Mayor Gaynor and the railroad ? " " I had to take their views and communicate them . I did that until informed that my services were no longer needed . I felt humiliated when the aspect - was put on this ' that I received $5,000 for introducing Mr. Shonts to the Mayor and I want Lo state emphatically that I received no such sum for that service . " Senator Thompson asked the witness how often he had seen Mayor Gaynor . " Three or four times a week , " said Mr. Towns . " T should say forty or fifty times would he within tile mark . " " Did your talk in October . 1909 , have anything to do with that $5,000 ? " Yes , I talked with a representative of the Interborough and made suggestions as to how to educate the public to the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Interborough . " Interborough for Both . - Was that talk to see if the Interborough would support Gaynor 's candidacy ? " " I understand that the Interborough sepported both candidates . " " You want us to understand that your talks with Mayor Gaynor had considerable to do with getting him to sign the contracts ? " " I said that I did certain things and that the results speak for themselves . " " Did you know that in July , 1911 , months after your services ended , this matter came up in the Board of Estirr ate and that Mayor Gaynor voted against the Interborough and used the word ' rascality ' ? Now , if that is so , your acnomplishment did n't amount to much , did it ? " " So it would seem , " replied Mr. Towns . " I had never had . further talks with the Mayor about this matter after May , 1910 . " " But you were paid in 1912 , two years after that ? " " I am painfully aware of that fact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote for these contracts ? " No , except that men are emotional . They cry today and laugh tomorrow . I was not in his thoughts . I never spoke to him again about subways . " ? ' Did you advise him during the camnaign as to what stand he should take on certain public questions ? " " Mayor Gaynor was not a man to take advice . " said Mr. Towns , " but you might , influence him by suggestions . " You were convinced that these contracts were a. good thing ? " All to Save Interborough . " There were no dual contracts at that time , " replied Mr. Towns . " I was always for anything that-would conserve the interests of the city . The one clear idea then was that the Interborough did not want its pt'operty destroyed by competition . " " Do you think Mr. Gaynor made a successful campaign ? " " Well , he was elected . " " You were with him constantly during that campaign ? " " Well , I was n't a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . " Do you think he made mistakes during that campaign ? " " He was elected . " " Did you advise him to be any other Way than he was in that campaign ? " " I advised him that I thought he was wrong . " " After the election , did you want to see him succeed ? " " Yes . " " Then how could you advise him to sign ' those contracts ? " These contracts did n't exist then . 11 was ' never ? consulted ' . about these , ' Con= tracts , I want So add - that , rite far as my ' relations with the Interborough were concerned , there-Was never a suggestion of anything sinister , ulterior , or immoral . " Mr. Moss then called J. Aspinwall Hodge , the lawyer , in the hope that new light would be shed on the Admiral Realty , Company 's suit . The witness was asked if he had any knowledge or information as to how this suit was begun . ? I have positive information that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply . " I had always supposed until the last few days that everybody in New York knew that the Admiral suit was begun at the instigation of the Interborough , so much so that in July , 1912 , I saw a supplemental complaint in an action in the Federal Court in which that fact was alleged . - Taxpayers , Suit Arranged . " In March of that year Mr. Shouts stated that as early as 1911 there was an agreement between the city and the Interborough that the question of the legality of the contract that might be entered into had been discussed and that It was agreed that a test case be submitted to the courts . Subsequent to that Mr. Nicoll suggested to Mr. Shouts that a taxpayers ' action might be brought and that would bring the same result . Mr. Shonts stated that that met with his approval and he instructed Mr. Nicoll to commence the action . " Testimony to all this is a matter of record , as I have said . It took place three months before the argument before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony by Mr. Shouts regarding his instruction that . the Admiral Realty Company 's action be brought was given at a hearing held in the witness 's office early in 1912 . It was a hearing in an action commenced by the Continental Securities Company against the Interborough , the Inter. - Met. , the Guaranty Trust Company . and ihe Lincoln Trust Company . The suit was an endeavor to convince the court that the combination of all the transportation facilities in New York City was a monopoly and in restraint of trade . " Mr. Hodge explained . " Who were some of the men present when the testimony was given ? ' asked Mr. Moss . " Winthrop &; Stimson , Mr. Cravath 's firm , DeLancey Nicoll . Richard Reed Rodgers . and P.ollins &; Rollins , " was the reply . " Therefore , I always took it for granted that everybody knew that it was a fact , but it appears now that counsel for the defendants did n't know . I only know what Mr. Shonts testified to . My impression is that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that the Interborough instigated the suit with the approval of the city . When I read the testimony given here it was the first intimation I had that none of the lawyers knew about it . " Complaints of Coal Men . The committee gave a part of its time yesterday to coal dealers . who object to the way the Interborough Company purchases its coal . Clarence C. Harris and G. S. Lescher , coal operators , gave testimony along this line . The former said he believed he could furnish coal at 23 cents a ton less than the Interborough pays , and he and other dealers have figured out that the Interborough loses $109,250 a year on its coal bills . Vice President David Ross of the Interborough was asked to give some information on the point . He has charge of purchases , and admitted that he had never heard of some of the companies which want to compel the Interborough to change its methods . He said the company bought its coal from the Derwind-White Company and from the Consolidation Coal Company . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two companies at the rate of , $3.23 a ton . The independent coal dealers maintain that they can supply the same grade of coal for $3 a ton . Mr. Ross said the fact that Mr. Berwind was a Director of the Interborough had never been considered , so far as he knew . He denied that his continuance in his present office depended upon his continuing to buy coal from Mr. Berwind 's company . He said the concern of the Interborough was to get the right kind of coal for purposes and also to insure itself of a steady supply by making contracts with established companies . The contracts with the present companies expires in July , I915. he said . The subcommittee has been going over the records of the action brought last January by Frederick C. Williams . a Brooklyn taxpayer , against the Public Service Commission to restrain it from approving plans for third tracking the Fulton Street , Brooklyn , elevated line . The case was decided against the plaintiff by Justice Manning , in Brooklyn . Senator Lawson , Chairman of the subcommittee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Public Service Commission , Assistant Counsel LeRoy T. Harkness , and a number of the commission 's engineers . The record , said Senator Lawson , shows that Secretary Whitney made an affidavit on Jan. 14 , 1919. in connection with the case ; inwhielthe-saldthere , Wak not pending **36;1328;TOOLONG by the Brooklyn'Tranalt Company " for : approval of.  - -  the elevated structure plans , although ' it had been shown ' that the 13 . R. T. had submitted a complete set of drawings on Jan. 10 , as well . as a'set ' of skeleton plans before that . Senator Lawson said Secretary , Whitney 's affidavit was not fair to the court in that he did not ' give full information . ' Open Fight on Whitney . Senator Lawson said it had been further testified that the ' plans were withdrawn from the commission , as well ' as all copies of a letter ' written by- Chief Engineer Menden of the B. R.- T. , in which the plans were described , leaving no record in the commission that any plans had ever been filed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Thompson would present all this testimony , along with other information , to the Senate Committee on Finance on Tuesday next and argue against Secretary Whitney being confirmed by the Senate as Public Service Commissioner . Senator Lawson would not say what the " other information " was . The sub-committee will continue on Monday and Tuesday its examination of the books of the Interborough in an effort to trace further the " prior determination " account . Senator Lawson ? said that many items were put into this , such as ice water , towels , soap , &c.,; and . under the heading " Administration " were put items of $150,000 , $50 , - 000 , and $10,000 . ' These amounts , said Senator Lawson , correspond exactly with the amounts awarded to President Shonts , Richard Reed Rodgers , and Auditor Gaynor as bonuses . Sure Shonts Did n't Get It. , After the Dual subway contracts were signed the Interborough claimed $1,500 , - 000 for preliminary expenses , and it was put under an account termed " prior determination . " The Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The subcommittee has already examined L. Frank Kohler. who has charge of the " prior determination " account in the commission . He and a squad were appointed to determine just how much should be allowed to the Interborough for its preliminary expenses . His examination yesterday by the sub-committee in part was as follows : Q. -- I show you an item . June 5 , 1913 , $125,000 to T. P. Shonts . A.-That was not included in any of the items I hivestigated , but it was included in the accounts of ' proposed subway routes . " Q.-You were not checking up " proposed subway routes " ? A.-No . Q.-Was there any portion of that subway route account in this determination ? A.-Yes : that Item of $129.000 . That Includes all the salaries of engineers , office rent , towels . supplies , and such things . Q.-Are you sure that no part of the $125.000 to Mr. Shouts became any part of the determined cost of construction or equipment ? A.-Absolutely . Says Expenditures Were Hidden . " There is not a question in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were ' commitments and obligations ' that could not be charged on the books of the Interborough Company . Chief Engineer Alfred Craven of the commission , who was partly examined as to these construction accounts suddenly got sick and went to Pineheirst some weeks ago . He must return and testify further . We 've got to find out all about the ' prior determination ' charges that the Interborough loaded on the city in making the dual contract . " Within the next few days certified copies of all testimony taken in connection with the Admiral Realty CoinnanY 's suit will be filed with the State and County Bar Association : certified copies of all the testimony In regard to the Gillespie contracts and T. H. Gillespie 's refusal to produce certain papers ' will be sent to the Legislature . and : certified copies of the testimony of George S. Coleman . chief counsel of the Public Service Commission , will be sent to the chairman of the commission . Senator Thompson has already asked for the removal of Mr. Coleman because of his failure to recollect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Secretary Travis II . Whitney of the Public Service Commission said last ' night that lie made the affidavit in the ' Williams case on the facts that were , before him at the time , and so far as ' he knew he stated the situation correotly as it then existed . lie said there were no plans of the B. R. T. regarding the Fulton Street elevated structure before the commission for approval , although there may have been some plans that did n't need the commission 's approval , but the approval of the engineers only . Mr. - Whitney said he did not know anything about the letter written by Chief Engineer Menden of the B. R. T. being withdrawn from the commission or the withdrawal of any plans .
