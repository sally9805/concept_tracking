TO one standing in the midst of his June garden , with all about him such eloquent signs of prosnerity and well being , the suggestion that there is in all probability trouble lurking behind every bush , even behind every leaf , will seem extremely unlikely . It is difficult to believe , in sight of all the bountiful and inherent beauty of June , that innumerable unprincipled little creatures are being nourished and trained that they may shortly pounce upon our treasures ; that more than one apparently healthy plant is experiencing the first stages of some fell disease ; that devastating electric storms are brewing , and parching droughts preparing a blow at our garden 's welfare and our own peace of mind . Yet all this is quite probable , and June is a time of peace when we may well prepare for war , or at least lay our plans so that we may circumvent these untoward forces and bring our garden safely through the season with its beauty and attractiveness unspoiled . Perhaps the first thing to be looked to is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are old plants , it is likely that angry-looking yellow spots may be found on the underside of the leaves . This means the dread hollyhock disease , or " rust , " the scourge of this noble plant , that quickly spreads and spoils its beauty and dignity . As soon as even one spot appears , the whole plant should be sprayed with a solution of Bordeaux Mixture ( directions come on the can ) . A simple remedy is that given by a great English gardener , and which I have found just as reliable . A breakfast cupful of common salt to three gallons of water , applied every two weeks with a syringe throwing so fine a spray that the solution will not reach the roots of the plant . Hollyhocks treated as biennials , that is , raised from seed one year , allowed to bloom the next , and pulled out the third , are seldom attacked by the disease at all ; and a further precaution is to plant them in rich , well-drained soil and in a position where wind and sunshine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the best remedy for all fungous diseases of plants ? those afflictions that appear in the form of rust or rot . Alpine , a strong nicotin-extract , applied in a solution of one part to forty parts of water , is said to seal the fate of aphis ? those little soft , green , sucking insects that infest coral honeysuckles , the young shoots of roses , and many other tender things ? and also of red spider and thrips . I have found tobacco-dust , applied when the leaves and stems are wet with dew , or after a rain , more deadly to these particular pests than the wet spray . For the destruction of those disgusting fat creatures of the soil that carry on their depradations under cover of the darkness ? cut-worms and grubs ? I know of but one sure remedy . They must be turned- out of the soil and killed . Even roses , now upon the threshold of their lovely flowering , may be in need of special care , though of course during the spring we have dusted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear and twice after ; have watched for the luxurious " leaf roller " and picked him off ; have kept a wary eye for aphis , and powdered the first relay with tobacco ; and have occasionally washed the whole bush with a weak solution of whale-oil soap ? for the rose is a dainty thing and appreciates nothing so much as cleanliness . In spite of all this care , two special dangers beset roses in June : the rose-bug and an affliction called mildew . Twice a day the rose-bugs must be picked off and dropped into a can of kerosene ; if one is faithful for a week , the danger is past . Mildew is a fungous disease that appears on the surface of the leaves like a powdering of dust . It is caused by long-continued spells of dampness , sour soil , or cold , cheerless weather . As soon as it appears , the affected leaves should be picked off and burned and the whole plant well dusted with powdered sulfur , applied after a rain or when wet with dew . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times at intervals through the month . Pruning and Cutting Back SHRUBS that have flowered in May should be pruned during the month , not cut hack , for this would spoil their promise of bloom for next , year . Thin them out well and cut the old wood to the ground so as to allow a free circulation of sun and air among the younger stems . Lilacs , weigelias , and mock oranges that are growing densely are much benefited by such treatment . All suckers should be cut out from around the lilac-bushes and the faded inflorescence removed . Many herbaceous plants are helped at this season by a good cutting back . It gives them a rather denuded look for a time , but very soon fresh shoots are thrust out in all directions , and the little plants regain the tidy rounded form that makes them objects of ornament the season through . Foxgloves are normally of biennial duration , but they may be tricked into perennialism by cutting the bloom stalk to the ground as soon as the flowers are spent . Little rosettes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will flower the following season , each rosette sending up a fine flower and stalk . Perhaps the most important part of the June garden is staking . A single hard storm can do more damage than we can repair all summer . All staking should be done as inconspicuously as possible and with a view to allowing the plant to maintain its natural habit of growth . Plants with a single slender stem , such as gladioli , lilies , foxgloves , or hollyhocks , should be fitted with a stake almost three-quarters the ultimate height of the stalk and tied lightly with raffia several inches below the top of the stake , thus allowing the plant to curve gracefully at the apex . For plants with many slender stalks I usually put a single  | strong central stake just behind the clump and tie each stem to it with a separate strand raffia , allowing each plenty of length , so that the plant has a fine fountain-like form . If the clumps happen to be large , several stakes to a clump may be used , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plants of diffuse spreading habits are best supported by twiggy branches , such as are used to support pea-vine Before June is over it is probable that the garden will require watering . This , however . should not be started until it is absolutely necessary and should then be so thoroughly done that the soil is wet at least two inches below the surface . It will not be necessary t .. do it more than once a week in even the dryer weather . Supports are to be bought to which the hose may be attached , so that when the broad spray is turned on quite an area : - covered . Frequent stirring and cultivating of the in dry weather is as important as watering . It is a good plan to do this with a short-handled fork or small hoe after every liar rain and also after the garden has lift. - thoroughly watered , as above suggested . All vines should be carefully trained in June . This will save endless trouble and much mutilation of the vines , for once they become tangles it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time June comes in our seed-sowing and planting should be completed , though if dahlias have been forgotten in the spring rush roots may still be procured well started iron the seedmen , and should he set out about three feet apart in deep , well-manured soil . A last planting of gladioli may also he made with a view to September decoration . Preparing for Next Year AND it is not too late to plan a bit for the beauty of next year 's garden . A bit of ground that receives the morning sun only should be chosen for a seedbed . The ground should be deeply dug and finely raked , and upon the surface should be spread about an inch of good loam and fine sand , about half and half . that has been put through a sieve ; this space must be well watered and made firm by means of a smooth hoard . Upon this surface the seed may be thinly sown in straight rows and labeled . Very fine seed requires no covering , but only to be pressed lightly into the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depth with the loam and sand mixture . Until the little plants begin to appear , the seed-bed should be entirely shielded from the sun by means of newspapers held in place by stones or light frames easily constructed at home , and covered with thick muslin . Early in August it will be advisable to transplant the seedlings to roomier quarters , either to where they are to remain or to similar seed-beds where they will have room to develop . They should be protected from the sun entirely for a few days , and should thereafter for several weeks be exposed to it for part of the day only . The seedlings should on no account be allowed to dry out . Here is a list of seeds that may be safely sown as late as the first or second week in June : Sweet-william , pink beauty ; hollyhocks ; Centaurea montana or hardy corn-flower ; Hesperia matronalis alba or sweet rocket ; Arabis alpina or rockcress ; Alyssum saxatile compactum or golden alyssum ; Dianthus plumarius or Scotch pinks ; Digitalis alba or foxglove ; Delphinium or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mullein pink ; Anthemi. tinctoria or golden camomile ; Campanula persicifolia or peach-leaved bell-flower ; Carpatica or Carpathian hairbell ; Chrysanthemum maximum or moon penny pansy ; Papaver orientate or oriental poppy ; Gaillardia or blanket flower ; lupines ; Linaum perenne or blue flax-flower ; Myosotis sylvatica or forget-menots ; ( Enothera youngii or evening primrose ; and michaelmas daisies .  |
