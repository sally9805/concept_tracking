txt Mayor Gaynor , though a guest of honor last night of the Alumni Association of ' the New York University Law School at its twenty-sixth annual dinner , held at the Hotel Astor , decided to dine alone in the restaurant on the first floor of the hotel . For a part of the time , at least , he was at the table . His hosts were also dining in the grand ballroom on the ; - eighth floor , many of them worrying as to why his seat was vacant , fur he had mingled with the guests earlier in the evening . ? What had actually happened . Secretary ! William M. Patterson explained , was that Mayor Gaynor had bean a guest of the essuciation at the hotel since 5 o'clock in the afternoon , a room having been assigned to him to which he could come directly from his office and rest until dinner was served . The Mayor did occupy his room , and at 6:30 o'clock . the time , it was said . he understood that dinner was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6Ighth floor , where nearly all of the 400 members and guests of the association - %Yere assembled . But instead of finding dinner ready , he learned while shaking 3-ianda , with his hosts and the other guests that he had run into a reception by the essoeiatiou to Gov . Weeks and the Supreme Court Bench of Connecticut , and that dinner would not be served for at least an hour . After a brief conversation with one of the Vice Presidents . Jay Noble EmIcy , ' the Mayor left the room , and went alone to the restaurant where . seated at an inconspicuous table , he ordered soup , a duckling , a pint of champagne , and ate lots dinner , taking occasional glances : while he ate at a slender brown copy of the cid " Blue Laws " of Connecticut , from which he later read to the guests upstairs .

One of the hotel attendants . selected for being fleet of foot , was stationed at the elevator landing on the eighth floor and directed to run to the dining room at top speed the moment the Mayor appeared , giving the signal . The plan worked excellently . Before the Mayor could quite reach the dopy Toastmaster James B. Dill and the Reception Committee left the table and greeted the Mayor at the-door . The instant the Mayor was recognized the guests gave three cheers , all present standing and waving their hands . The orchestra broke into the inevitable " For lie'sa Jolly Good Fellow .
