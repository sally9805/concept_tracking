December 14 , 1918 THE NEW a looser association , which has so far been mooted in Dutch circles , calls for complete autonomy for every dominion parliament , in the sense of abolition of all control or veto by the British Parliament , subject , in case of a deadlock , to appeal to an international court of arbitration . Under this scheme a purely formal membership in the British Empire , with allegiance to the king , would be retained . The plan clearly proposes a loose sort of federation , towards the establishment of which the recognition of the dominions as each a " small nation " in its own right , is sought as the first step . It may be asked why the advocates of this scheme should be willing to submit to an international court , but not to , say , an imperial council on which representatives of South Africa would have equal seat and vote with the representatives of the other members of the Empire . It is possible only to hazard a guess at the answer . Some , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British dominions will but accelerate the disintegration and loss of Dutch ways and language , of Dutch cultural traditions . But the profoundest reason , not often openly confessed , lies probably in the fear of the Dutch that the pressure of public opinion in the Empire will force upon them a more liberal policy towards the negroes . The typical Dutchman , though not normally unkind in the treatment of natives , yet views them as nothing but " schepsels " ( creatures ) , little better than animals , useful for their manual labor in field and mine , but not to be educated , not to be enfranchised , on no account to be admitted to an equality With the white man . Aristotle 's famous phrase slaves by nature " hits off his point of view . The traditional British policy , which prevailed before the days of the Union in the Cape Colony and which aims at educating the native for citizenship , and admitting him progressively to the exercise of Political rights , fills the Boer with deep distrust and aversion . Just before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purpose of Preparing for the segregation of the white and black races by preventing the further acquisition of land by either race ? the effect of which was to turn the numerous native squatters on Boer farms at one stroke into serfs bound to the soil . Mean-While , nothing has been done towards effecting segregation or delimiting adequate native territories , and a sense of injustice and suspicion has been created in the native mind throughout South Africa which only the war has prevented from attracting the attention it deserves . A small nation which is liable to exploit its autonomy in favor of racial dominion of white over black , needs watching lest its policy be sinister for the future of the White man in Africa . R. F. ALFRED HOERNLi . Sibelius TITERS have brought the north into houses , and there transmuted it to music . And their art is dependent on the shelter , and , removed from it , dwindles . But Sibelius has written music innocent of roof and enclosure , music proper indeed to the vasty open , the Finnish heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out into the northern day , we should find it undiminished , vivid with all its life . For it is blood-brother to the wind and the silence , to the lowering cliffs and the spray , to the harsh crying of sea-birds and the breath of the fog , and , set amid them , would wax , and take new strength from the strengths its kin . Air blows through the music of Sibelius , quickens even the slightest of his compositions . There are certain of his songs , certain of his orchestral sketches , that would be virtueless enough were it not for the windy freshness that pervades them . Out of all his works , even out of the most commonplace , there proceeds a far and resonant space . Songs like To the Evening , Call , Autumn Sundown , whatever their ultimate musical value , seem actually informed by the northern evening , seem to include within their very substance the watery tints of the sky , the naive fragrance of forests and meadows , the tintinnabulation drifting through the still air of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the quality of his native earth that he knows precisely in what black and massive chord of the piano , say , lies the silence of rocks and clouds , precisely what manner of resistance between chant and piano can make human song ring as in the open . But it is in his orchestral works , for he is determined an orchestral writer , that he has fixed it most successfully . There has been no composer , not Brahms in his German forest , nor Rameau amid the poplars of his silver France , not Borodin on his steppes , nor Moussorgsky in his snow-covered fields under threatening skies , whose music gives back the colors and forms and odors of his native land more persistently . The orchestral compositions of Sibelius seem to have passed over black torrents and desolate moorlands , through pallid sunlight and grim primeval forests , and become drenched with them . The instrumentation is all wet grays and blacks , relieved only by bits of brightness wan and elusive as the northern summer , frostily green as the polar lights . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleakness of the English horn , full of shattering trombones and screaming violins , full of the sinister rolling of drums , the menacing reverberation of cymbals , the icy glittering of harps . The musical ideas of those of the compositions that are finely realized recall the ruggedness and hardiness and starkness of things that persist in the Finnish winter . The rhythms seem to approach the wild unnumbered rhythms of the forest and the wind and the flickering sunlight . Music has forever been a movement " up to nature , " and Schoen-berg 's motto is but the precision of a motive that has governed all composers . But Sibelius has written music that seems to come as the very answer to the call , and to be the north indeed . Such a discovery of nature was necessarily a part of his self-revelation . For Sibelius is essentially the Norseman . For all his personal accomplishment , his cultural position , he is still the Finnish peasant , preserving intact within himself the racial inheritance . Other musicians , having found life still a grim brief welter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the falling of sure unalienable doom , have fancied themselves the successors of the Scalds , and dreamt themselves within the gray primeval north . But , in the presence of Sibelius , they seem only too evidently men of a gentler , later generation . Beside his , their music appears swathed in romantic glamour . For there are times when he comes into the concert-room like some man of a former age , like some spare knotted barbarian from the world of the sagas . There are times when he comes amongst us like one who might quite conceivably have been comrade to pelted warriors who fought with clubs and hammers , like one who might have beaten out a rude music by black-smoking hearth-sides quite as readily as made tone-poems for the modern concert-room . And his music , with its viking-blows and wild crying accents , its harsh and uncouth speech , sets us without circumstance in that sunken world , sets us in the very midst of the stark men and grave savage women for whom the sagas were made , so that we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can well-nigh touch them with the fingers of our hands . And it is for the reason that Sibelius is so fundamentally a man as combat with the north has made him that vision of his native earth alone could bring him rich self-consciousness . For his individuality is but the shape of soul given his race by its century-long adjustment . It is the north that has given him his profound experience . Its rhythms have distinguished him . Its color , and the color of his spirit , are twin . And so he turns towards it as to a mirror . Like that of the hero of his tone-poem , his life is a long journey toward Finland . Contact with Finnish earth gives him back into his own hands . It is the north , the wind and the moorland and the , sea , that gathers the fragments of his broken soul , and makes him whole again . It was with the sanction of a people that Sibelius came to his task . For centuries before his birththe race that bore him had lain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigor was germinating within it . Youth had overtaken it once more , and filled it with the desire of inde pendence . Chained to the Russian Empire , it was reaching out towards all that could give it the strength to persist and endure , towards all that could give it knowledge of its proper soul . And so Sibelius , in the search for the expression of his own personality , so much at one with that of his fellows , was travelling in the common way . The word that he was seeking , the word that should bring fulfil ? ment to his proper soul , was deeply needed by his fellows . Inarticulate thousands , unaware though they were of his existence , awaited his work , wanted the sustenance it could give . And , cer tainly , the sense of the needfulness of his work , the sense of the large value set upon his best and purest attainments by life itself , must have been with Sibelius always , must have supplied him with a powerful incentive and made enormously for his achievements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race driving him . He must have had con tinually the marvellous stimulus of feeling about him , for all the night and the cold , the forms of comrades straining towards a single lofty goal ' felt himself one of an army of marching meth This folk , far in its past , had imagined the figure of a her.o-poet , Vainemunden , and placed in hi , s , hands an instrument " shaped out of very sorrow , and attributed magical power to his song . And Sibelius , bowed over his music-paper , must have felt the dream stir within him , must have felt in ' carnate within himself , however incompletely , that mysterious image , and so proceeded with his work everlastingly assured that all he actually accoo plished woke from out of the heart of a people , an responded to its immemorial need . Out of such an impulse his art has come . No doubt , some of it is not the response entirely worthy of so high a stimulus . Few modern cools posers of eminence are as singularly uncTell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the amiable elegance of the Valse Triste an that which produced the hard and naked esserl ' tiality of the Fourth Symphony are almost foreign to one another . The creative power itseht is extraordinarily fitful in him . It is as if , for all his physical robustness , he has not quite the spirit ' ual indefatigability of the major artist . He has not that inventive heat that permits the composer of indisputably the first rank to realize himself flaggingly in all his independence and intensity ' Too often Sibelius 's own personality is clutter ? and muffled by those of other men . No doubt ; every creative artist passes through a period 0 ' submission to alien faiths . But in Sibelius , there appear to exist two distinct personalities , the one strong and independent , the other timid and uninventive , who dominate him alternately . Even some of the music contemporaneous with the magnificent Fourth Symphony is curiously ineffectual and pointless . True , the color , the air and tone of the north are never entirely absent from his work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark and mourning accents of the Scandinavian folksong . For all the modernity of medium they are simple and sober . Moreover , in those of his compositions that approach banality most closely , there is a certain saving hardiness and virility and honesty . Unlike his neighbor , Grieg , he is never mincing and meretricious . We never find him languishing in a pretty boudoir . He is always out under the sky . It is only that he is not always free and resourceful and deeply self-critical . Even through the bold and rugged and splendid Violin Concerto there flit at moments the Shadows of Beethoven and . Wagner and Tchaikowsky . The first theme of the quartet Voces Intimae resembles not a little a certain theme in Boris . The close of Nightride and Sunrise is watered Brahms and watered Strauss . And there are phrases in his tone-poem that commence with all his proper rhYthmic ardor and then suddenly degenerate . There are moments when his harmonic sense , generally keen and true , abandons him completely . And even works like the Finlandia and Karelia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 411 their suggestion of peasant voices lifted in song , disappoint because of the substitution of a popular LYricism , a certain easy sweetness , for the high Poetry one might have expected . And yet , one has but to turn to the symphonies of Sibelius to encounter music of another intensity , itd gauge the richness of response that , at times , is given him to make . It is as if the very dignity a , tid grandeur of the medium itself sets him free . Just as the form of the concerto seems to have liven his sense of the violin a play apparently de-hied it by the smaller mediums , so these larger Orchestral forms seem to have liberated his imagination , his orchestral genius , and made him poet of his folk indeed . , His personal quality , spread more thinly in his songs and tone-poems , is essentialized and developed in these other works . e symphonies themselves are in a sense the ht , aRes of the . essentialization . In the first of them 15 language emerges , to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely distinguished . There is a looseness and lushness , a romanticism and balladry , in the work , that is not quite characteristic . Still , the honesty , ar e grimness and savagery and lack of sensuality , re Sibelius 's own . The adagio is steeped in his proper pathos , the pathos of brief bland summers , of light that falls for a moment gentle and mellow , and then dies away . The crying finale is full of the tragedy of northern nature . And in the second symphony the independence is complete . The orchestra is handled individually , sparingly , and with perfect point . Often the instruments sound singly , or by twos and threes . What had been but half realized in the earlier work is distinct and important in this . It is as if Sibelius had come upon himself , and so been able to rid his work of all superfluity and indecision . And , curiously , through speaking his own language in all its homeliness and peasant flavor , he seems to have moved more closely to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for all its absolute and formal character , reflects a landscape . It is full of home sounds , of cattle and " , saeters , " of timbered houses and sparse nature . And through it there glances a pale evanescent sunlight , and through it there sounds the burden of a lowly tragedy . But it is only with his Fourth Symphony , dubbed " futuristic " because of the unusual boldness and pithiness of its style , the absence of a general tonality , the independence of the orchestral voices , that Sibelius 's gift attains absolute expression . There are certain works that are touchstones , and make apparent what is original and virtuous in all the rest of the labors of their creator , and give his personality a unique and irrefragible position . The Fourth Symphony of Sibelius is such a composition . It is a very synthesis of all his work , the reduction to its simplest and most positive terms of a thing that has been in him since first he began to write , and that received heretofore only fragmentary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The structure is all bone . The style is sharpened to a biting terseness . The coloring is the refinement of all his color ; the rhythms have a freedom toward which Sibelius 's rhythms have always aspired ; the mournful melody of the adagio is well-nigh archetypical . All his life Sibelius had been searching for the tone of the music , desiring to speak with its authority , and concentrate the soul and tragedy of a people into a single and eternal moment . All his life he had been seeking the prophetic gestures of which this work is full . For the symphony is like a summary and a conclusion , it carries us into some high place before which the life of man is spread out and made apparent . The four movements are the four planes that solidify a single concept . The first sets us in a grim forest solitude , out in some great unlimited loneliness , beneath a sombre sky . There is movement , a climax , a single cry of passion and despair , and then , only the soughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flickering of mad watery lights , a fantastic whipping dance , a sudden sinister conclusion . In the adagio , a bleak lament struggles upwards , seems to push through some vast inert mass , to pierce to a momentary height and largeness , and then sinks , broken . And through the finale , there quivers an illusory light . The movement is the march , the oncoming rush of vast formless hordes , the passage of unnamed millions that surge for an instant with their cries and banners , and vanish into nothingness . It is possible that Sibelius will create another work similarly naked and intense . More definitive it can not be . For in this it was given him to make his monument and sign , to find the language of a people , and with the divine knowledge of the seer to cry to all the world " This is our life !
