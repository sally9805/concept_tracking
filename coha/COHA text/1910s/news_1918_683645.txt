txt Idealistic Plans for Peace . The proposals of the Bolsheviki as published in this morning 's papers seem to show that these people are not mere German tools . They are simply people who do not understand the war : and their suggestions recall the suggestions of Lord Lansdowne and the later papers of President Eliot . They would settle everything comfortably around a , table ? plebiscites for Alsace and Lorraine , evacuation of Belgium , with damages to be assessed by an International tribunal , gradual disarmament and good feeling on all sides . The world as it is pictured in the 1301-sheviki imagination no longer exists ; and the same comment is , to be made on the Lansdowne and Eliot papers . The common sense of America never showed up more strongly than in the fact that this kind of proposal has ceased to create a ripple of public interest . We ought , however , to be ready to undo any injustice we may have done to the Bolsheviki in classing them as mere German tools . No one thinks this of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hope that events may bring them light as to the nature of the war .
