For a subject that was pronounced " dead " a year ago , tariff revision is proving itself a particularly lively corpse . Both houses of Congress are giving up hours to its discussion . It is evident that the Western Republicans mean business ; they are just as hot against dishonest tariff taxes now as they were during the campaign . An agitation , of that kind , once started , gets rebellious ideas into the heads of the people , and will not die down . Even Senator Aldrich now perceives that the popular wrath against his handiwork can not be laid by smooth words , and is prepared to concede something to it . A great light has also dawned upon Senator Lodge , and lie  --  helped on , of course , by the angry Massachusetts sentiment which makes his reelection doubtful  --  is also found among the tariff-revision prophets . Little can be expected of the short session , naturally , yet there seems a chance that a bill may pass making the Tariff Board permanent and enlarging its powers . Postmaster-General Hitchcock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his reduction of the deficit of his department by $11,500,000 . In his natural desire to wipe out the remaining deficit , he recommends the plan of making the magazines pay a higher rate for their advertising pages . Whatever the merits of this proposition , there is room for effecting great savings in other ways , by introducing business-like methods and getting the maximum work out of his employees . He has already proposed placing the low-grade postmasters under the civil-service rules . If he and Mr. Taft , without further ado , weed out a few hundred inefficient postmasters who hold office solely for political reasons , that alone will almost wipe out the deficit , provided that the postmasters are succeeded by energetic , enterprising business men . All newspaper publishers know how untrustworthy the present postal service is . Those in New York are doing a lot of the work of the post office , because the post office does not do , it in any satisfactory way . The best way to improve its revenues would be to make it trustworthy and efficient . Incredible as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorably reported a bill to add nearly fifty millions of dollars to the existing pension roll . The pension of a veteran of sixty-two is by it increased from $12 to $15 a month . A veteran of seventy will receive from $50 to $75 a month additional , and one of seventy-five from $20 to $36 a month . An intermediate grade , between sixty-five and seventy , will come in for an increase of $20 a month . It is represented that in the first year the increase will " only be twenty-five millions , " but the fact remains that within two years the extra pay will be fifty . millions . What becomes of the proposed government savings ? The debt to the old soldiers , which every one acknowledges , has been met more generously than any similar one in the history of the world . In addition , cowards , shirkers , and camp followers have profited by Treasury gifts until the privileged class of veterans has become as dulled to what is just and proper as have the protected manufacturers . The significance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a defeat to Mr. Roosevelt , is emphasized by the official figures now published . We refer to the comparison between the plurality attained by Mr. Dix and those given to his associates on the State ticket . It is plain from these figures that Dix ran almost exactly 50,000 ahead of his ticket , his plurality was 67,401 , as against 18,408 for the Comptroller , 18,332 for the Treasurer , and 18,066 for the State Engineer . Compared with the Lieutenant-Governor , his lead was not so great , while the comparison with the votes on Secretary of State and Attorney-General shows a greater lead ; the reason in each case being obvious . Inasmuch as Mr. Stimson was an excellent candidate , this preferential vote of 50,000 in Mr. Dix 's favor is clearly to be interpreted as a vote of protest ; nor does it begin to measure the extent of that vote . For every Republican that entered his protest by simply discriminating in favor of Dix , there were probably three or four who either voted the straight Democratic ticket or did not vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people during the campaign , is confirmed by the way in which the hoofs went with the hide  --  the Legislature with the Governorship  --  in spite of the advantages of Republican districting . Both Gov : elect Dix personally and the State of New York are to be congratulated on the decision of Mr. Charles E. Treman to accept the very important post of Superintendent of Public Works . One of the chief difficulties encountered by Governors , and especially by Governors of this State , in which the magnitude and complexity of the affairs to be administered are so great , is that of securing the services of men of a high order of ability in the principal offices connected with the Administration . Acceptance of these duties , on the part of the men most peculiarly fitted to perform them , almost always involves a personal sacrifice , and there is no truer patriotism than that which is manifested by shouldering these burdens for the public good . In the case of Mr. Treman , the question of health entered into the case , and hence his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There seems to be no doubt that Woodrow Wilson was approached by agents of Roger Sullivan when in Chicago recently , and offered a bribe in the shape of the votes of the Illinois delegation to the next Democratic National Convention it he would only not oppose Mr. Smith 's election to the Senate . There are prominent politicians we might mention , whose mode of procedure would have been to palliate , consider , and compromise in order to be " practical . " It would by many have been considered justifiable under the new theory of applied political ethics . But Mr. Wilson 's reply was prompt and vigorous . For those who know him or have watched his political career , it is not difficult to imagine the fine scorn with which he waved these tempters aside , with complete contempt for any effect his act might have on his own career . This episode is , in fact , iliumfined by a significant remark made by Mr. Wilson at the Southern Society 's dinner last week . Introduced , with poor - taste , as a probable " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration of whither his new work would take him . He cared , he said , only for the task in hand , , and not where he would arrive , except that he wanted to land " on the necks of certain people . " There is every reason to believe that he will have his wish . The Americans who live in New Jersey ; and those who live elsewhere , know a brave man when they see him . From , all accounts , the State is rising to Mr. Wilson in a way to . make Mr. Smith 's brazen stand speedily appear an act of political suicide . Pennsylvania 's Legislative Reference Bureau is ready to perform its function of first aid to legislators . Although created by the Legislature of 1909 , it was not until January of the present year that the Bureau began actual work . The first step was to establish a system of classification by which all the material to be gathered could be made available for instant use . The basis of this classification is the living statute law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exclusive of those which the courts have held to be repealed by implication or that have been declared unconstitutional . The 2,200 bills of the session of 1909 were then filed according to this classification , the history of each being indicated upon it . Cards were then obtained daily with the titles of bills introduced in the Legislatures of other States in the sessions of 1910 , and the most important bills selected , sent for , and filed . Seventeen newspapers and a large number of periodicals were subscribed for , carefully clipped , and the clippings indexed and filed . Books and pamphlets , compilations of laws , and decisions of courts were also . obtained . The object of the Bureau is to present to members of the Legislature information , digested and arranged , upon as many subjects as possible of those they may be interested in . The - corresponding experiment in Wisconsin . has been highly successful . The seven selections for major-gener.als and brigadier-generals announced by the President represent almost a clean . sweep for the bureaucrats of the War Department . Gen. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war soldiers , is to be a major-general for three months before retirement  --  an honor no one will begrudge him . He is to be succeeded , not by one of the fifteen line brigadiers , but by the chief of the Coast Artillery , Brig. - Gen . Arthur Murray , whose place will in turn be taken by an officer on duty at the War Department , Col. E. M. Weaver . Of the four colonels to be promoted , the most gratifying fact is that they are colonels , and not captains or majors . On the other hand , all four are men who have been on detached duty from their regiments for the greater part of the last four years . Col. Duncan , one of the two infantrymen selected , is on duty at the War Department , to which Col. Schuyler of the cavalry was under orders . Col. Evans , too , is an officer who has been a great deal on special duty these last few years . This batch ? of promotions is , therefore , certain to be receiv : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief that the way to get ahead is to obtain duty near the po Nr , ers that be in Washington . Why should there be objection to Brigham Young 's portrait on the silver of the battleship Utah ? Are we not wiping out all historicaL issues of the past and forgiving everybody for everything ? With Robert E. Lee in Statuary Hall in his Confederate uniform , and Southern Governors declaring that Jefferson Davis shall soon have a place there as Well , why cavil at Brigham Young 's honoring on a battleship ? Lee was an admirable character and a wonderful general ; Brigham Young was an amazing conqueror of the desert and a remarkable captain of industry . The one stood for slavery of the blacks ; the other for the enslavement of women . But let us forget all that and put it purely on the ground of their own personalities . Let the dead political past bury its dead . Soon we shall have monuments to Benedict Arnold and Aaron Burr  --  indeed , a memorial to Arnold in praise of his gallantry at Saratoga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In time , we shall commemorate as well Mr. Bryan 's devotion to the cause of sound money and James Blaine 's adoration of truth and common honesty . The statue of Matthew Quay stands in the Harrisburg Capitol . Whatever else we are , let us be charitable in regard to the past , and let us not impose standards of taste or ethics upon the rising generation . They have enough problems to face as it is . The moral influence alone of the Census would justify its cost . Instead of inducing satisfaction over past achievements , the impartial figures have only spurred ambition higher . This is true in a two-fold sense . In Chicago , this ambition takes the paradoxical form of looking forward to the day when an obstinate Census Bureau will allow the claim of 2,500 ; 000 individuals within its limits . This is a material reduction . from the programme of the Three-Million Club , but , as an exchange of an impracticable ideal for a possibility , speaks well for the philosophic calm produced by the disappointing figures of 1910 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is leading many a city to place upon quality rather than quantity . Boston is modestly insisting that it is better to be just Boston than a so-called Greater Boston , which would not rival the largest centres anyhow . And to a number of other cities the population figures have brought this same lofty aim and solace . Mr. Choate 's announcement that Secretary Knox has worked out a plan by which the fifteen judges of the Court of Arbitral Justice , recommended by the second Hague Conference , may be chosen with satisfaction to the nations concerned , is most gratifying . Owing to the inability to devise a method satisfactory to the smallest countries , this court has languished . Few people realize how much good will come from the establishment of a permanent arbitration tribunal of this kind . Temporary arbitration courts have done valuable service ; but what is needed is a permanent court to build up traditions and rules and lay down new principles of international law and justice . The question of enforcement of the decrees of an international court was discussed last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Justice Henry B. Brown . He regards the establishment of an international force to see to the acceptance of decisions as unpractical and as leading to the wars the world is anxious to stop . But many people will not be able to follow him in. this . Why , for instance , assuming an- arbitration between Germany and England , would it not be sufficient to have it known that France , the United States , Russia , Italy , and Austria would see to the acceptance of the court 's decree ? No actual use of force would ever be necessary . The news from Cuba continues to be most unsatisfactory . So far as the Government is concerned ; it long since forfeited whatever confidence of the business classes it ever had . Graft charges of a wholesale character are made every day , and Gomez himself , who is now reported to be in fear of his life , is the target of open accusation , and of much innuendo . No one believes that he will reside in Cuba , even if he survives his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper is reported as laying the attempted assassination of Gen. Pino Guerra , once one of Gomez 's close allies , at the President 's own door . As for the regular army itself , which , contrary to common sense , the last American Governor of Cuba , Mr. Magoon , forced on the island with the consent of Mr. Taft , it has become a source of weakness , instead of strength . This was foretold at the time , but the blunder was insisted upon . Now Gomez is taking their ammunition away and scattering the troops over the island , to prevent their turning upon him . As the present Cuban situation is largely the result of Mr. Taft 's own policy , he can not fail to be deeply concerned over the unhappy outlook . Pauperism in Great Britain has greatly decreased in amount , although it has increased in cost . At present , the outdoor ' pauperism is the lowest ever recorded for England and Wales , and the lowest in London for seven years , while the indoor pauperism of the metropolis is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the last ten years , says John Burns , president of the Local Government Board , because the workhouse is no longer the Bastille it used to be , and because children within the wards of the poorhouse no longer experience the treatment that was meted out to the Oliver Twists of fifty years ago . Above half of the indoor poor are now in special institutions , where their ailments are better looked after than in the old mixed general workhouse , which was a combination of the lunatic asylum and the jail , " with a little bit of street-corner thrown in . " The increase of cost is due to the higher standard of relief for the aged , the sick , and children . It is better economy to spend $250 in getting rid of sickness before the patient is fourteen years old than to spend $1,500 in palliating his symptoms after he is forty . Of the total pauperism , 30 per cent . is ascribed to sickness , and 45 per cent . to age and infirmity . As the fourth decade since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close , the region formed by the two conquered provinces is about to enter on a new stage of its existence as part of the German Empire . The Bundesrat has adopted the draft of a constitution for Alsace-Lorraine , including the creation of a bicameral Legislature , of which the lower house is to be elected by universal suffrage . This may safely be regarded as marking a stage in the subsidence of anti-German feeling in the Reichsland , in which such a step is regarded as unobjectionable by German sentiment in the ruling classes . The event may serve , too , as a reminder of the virtually complete disappearance of the revanche idea in France , a thing which , forty years ago , hardly anybody regarded as possible in so short a time . Not that the sentiment of attachment to France has ceased to exist in Alsace and Lorraine , or that regret for the loss of her provinces no longer enters into the thoughts of the people of France ; tut the whole tone of the situation has changed . The fiery passions which for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a quenchless flame , are now almost as completely a memory Es are the like feelings which were for a time cherished in connection with " the lost cause " in our own South . Monday 's action of the Imperial Senate of China in adopting a resolution impeaching- the- Grand Colincillors , brings the difference between the Progressives and the Regent party to an issue . Young China is impatient of further delay , and the imperial edict announcing that the demand for the creation of a responsible Cabinet was refused , has only tempted the provincial delegates to take the bit in their teeth . If the contest were between the Progressives and the Regent , prediction of the result would not be difficult . But Chinese politics is not so simple . The-Manchu nobles , who are adherents of the Empress Dowager , voted in October with the Progressives for the immediate-convening of Parliament , and thus declared themselves opposed to the conservative policy of the Regent . But when , flushed with their successes , the-Young China party passed a resolution calling upon the Grand Councillors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sanctioning the Hunan , loan , a hint was conveyed through the president of the Ministry of Finance , who had been on the side of the Progressives , that any further violent display of hostility to the Government might mean the dissolution of the House . The Progressives of the Senate are evidently in the temper to test their power to the utmost , but no one can be surprised if , whether disholution comes or not , palace politics defeats their present move for an authority which will be theirs in the end , but very possibly after a long period of waiting . If the late Professor Freeman still cares for what goes on in this world , an approving smile must have been seen on the features of his shade as he learned that the Asiatic Exclusion League of San Francisco had resolved last Monday to give up the use of the term " Anglo-Saxon . " Its motives are not exactly those of scholarship . It is not a question of substituting " Old English . " The point in this case is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Slays who , with the League , are determined to keep the pure native stock of this country from ' being contaminated by Asiatic immigration ; object to having our civilization described any longer as Anglo-Saxon . Hereafter it is to be known as " American "  - -  though if anybody can tell what that word means , racially , he will be wiser than seven men that can render a reason . Professor Freeman held that Anglo-Saxon was inexact and misleading , but we doubt if he would have liked " American " any better . Freeman was once toasted , somewhat ambiguously , as " the historian who had shown such an intimate acquaintance with the rude manners of our forefathers , " but we think that , even in that matter , the Asiatic Exclusion League could have convinced him that time 's noblest offspring is the last .
