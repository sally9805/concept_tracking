 | THE usual habit of mind of the artist leads him into manners of consideration which are less direct than those of some other professions . It is a very true instinct which has made Mr. Whistler , the American painter in England , use the butterfly as his signature . It is not that the butterfly 's flight is really wayward and capricious , but that his mode of search is not conducted on the same lines as ours . I am not apologizing , but merely stating this tendency of the average artistic thinking . Naturally , also , the man who has done things in which his personality largely enters , and who knows how inadequate is all effort that is guided by an ideal , that man will be timid in deciding to express himself otherwise than through his accustomed forms . He will have believed and followed out certain principles , and the more he respects these principles and ideas , the more unwilling he must be to have his personal equation , his own shortcomings , become confused with the principles which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can see to the artists ' talking much about art , and it is often the reason for their wise silence upon the subject . If this scruple is well understood by those to whom he speaks ? if his attempt to disengage ideas from the contradictions of practice is felt by those addressed , the artist , I hope , can safely trust to his hearers . While detained by such considerations , I happened to read some statements of Mr. Henry Rutgers Marshall in a number of SCRIBNER 'S MAGAZINE , which treated of the teaching of art in universities . On that theme , I have woven the expression of certain contemplations affected more or less by former ideas which had at first presented themselves . I asked myself , if , after all , such a storehouse of intellectual thought as a university must be , would not be the best sounding-board , if I may so say , for the assertion and diffusion of reasonable appeals to higher thought and higher practice in art . @# We are impressed to-day by the enormous power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessities of trade and the principles that govern it . For the first time since the date of the Roman Empire , we see all known nations affected by these exigencies , and that , to their knowledge . For , of course , these laws must always have existed , and have been the basis of much of the history of the world , but at no time has this been so clear , and at no time before could such questions have been openly considered before an entire world . Now , then , as far as is possible in human affairs , the opposite energies to those of trade are the pursuits of truth by Science and by Art . These are both disinterested and not momentary . The university is a stable support for these balancing desires of man . Here the contemplation of the past may be reasonably and rightly of more importance than any management of the present . Here experiences can be stored up , which will affect the future only . Here the one can hold out against the many , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be of persistent law can be kept alive and serve for outside guidance . The enthusiasm for what is apparently useless , will feed the practical usefulness of the outside world . The very fact that this tree of knowledge grows apart , and so grows that it can not be directly made use of ? can not be cut down f or common purposes of trade ? may allow it to grow in such liberty , in such health , as to afford shelter to those who need shade and protection from the outside world . Its apparent uselessness is its real virtue . I use the words " usefulness " and " uselessness " in a momentary manner , because there must come a time when they are interchangeable , and what has been abstract study or contemplation or accumulation of forgotten fact , often accompanied by an attitude of mind too lofty for the moment , becomes the source of the power for all usefulness . The breadth of mind fostered by the study of opposites , when well directed ,  | allows the use of partial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the occasion . So that the study of past art , the appreciation of what has been best , has helped the momentary development of the artist in what seemed new lines . Never , perhaps , has the admiration of the past been more intense than during that individual flowering , which we call the Renaissance . The flowering of Greek art was attended by continual inquiries as to the limits of the True , the Beautiful , and the Good . Remember Socrates , remember Euripides . With the latter , a previous training in pictorial art might easily pass into the free and open handling of the great problems of life : his " modernity , " as it is called , is entangled with pictorial feeling , and that lyric quality so distinct in the Greek poets is a manner of representing sentiment and feeling by images , the nearest of all artistic expression , the expression of painting , which uses things for thoughts . I can imagine that I recognize the distinctive artistic habit and training in the platonic Socrates . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appeal to description as a method of enforcing or rather instigating reasoning , and , finally , in that marvellous use of irony , which is especially the position natural to the artist ? that is to say , a form of balance and of measure , and not carrying things into extremities , which is also a type of the Greek mind , and its glory . That is to say , the constant view of a possible other side so presented as to oblige one to choose by one 's own decision . Surely , we can see that in such cases the abstract contemplation of art has not apparently limited its free play . There is , on the contrary , something in all Greek work , which even in the poorer examples testifies to a higher culture above the maker . More probably intellectual struggle and philosophical contemplation served as a helping of the higher ideas of art against the very commercial development of Greek civilization . And so , perhaps , with Mr. Marshall , one might be tempted to place in learned institutions disconnected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping up tradition . And , by tradition , I do not mean the tradition of practice ? that might or might not be ? but the tradition of what is known and can be known . There is enough of science , enough of history , necessary to the serious teaching of art , necessary to its practice ? to supply certainly a form of education . And it is not only for the practitioner that such accumulation of knowledge would be valuable ; the public to be appealed to by the practitioner would , in its best examples , have been informed by such a training . The history of art might form as good a historical training as any other history , and could not be pursued without such an acquaintance with the developments of human thought as would amount to a certain study of philosophy . Roughly , let us instance the fact that the developments of architecture in France , as we call the land to-day , are dependent upon the divisions of former times and their slow delivery from outside influences and gradual but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mr. Marshall has thought , of a university teaching as being quite different from the school teaching of such great institutions as the French Schools for Art . These are Government concerns which train their pupils for usefulness , and especially usefulness for the Government ; prizes , medals , etc. , give even civil exemptions , as the second-class medal shortens military service ; hence , contradictory studies can not coexist there . The student is not presented with views that might make him choose some other path than the one ordained for him . The scientific studies in art , which might weaken his belief in certain rules , are more or less neglected . Those studies which will hold him in the narrow- and straight path , are strongly encouraged . Now this I take to be the opposite of the contradictory pursuits which a university could encourage ; and in so far , the university could give the highest teaching possible , apart from that great teaching , the influence of persons . Such a teaching as this latter might or might not coexist with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival on the stage of certain individuals who are to give their stamp to already known thought , no university can provide . No one has ever sowed the seed of genius . But no teaching either , has ever broken the force of that power of the individual , which we know as genius . Though a great number of the greater minds in art as well as in science and literature have not had the full  | academic training of some of their inferiors , can we in any way suppose that they would have refused it , since they have laboriously replaced whatever want of training they felt in themselves ? We know the enormous influence of Leonardo throughout Italy , and how he might be said to be a university in himself . The anxiety to know , the last interest that remains of human interests , according to Virgil , so devoured Leonardo that his production as a painter exists more largely in the works of other men than in his own . The persistence of his mind through the Italian artists is like the persistence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last Supper , " which carries its meaning to us though most of it no longer exists . But we have built it up out of tradition , out of copies and descriptions and analogy . The different minds affected by Leonardo received these impressions and these teachings according to their natural bent , and perhaps have remained as original as they could have been without the greater mind inciting them . Surely we can see how full of life the study of art , in connection with the entire reach of science , has proved to be with these men . Take another illustrious name , that of Michael Angelo , we can see how rich the supply of thought and of study must have been with which he fed what we know of him , the plastic representation of the human form divine . Traditionally , we know of him , as of the other , that they were earnest and early workers in the study of that necessary anatomy which was to give them the power of expression . No , all that can be supplied is knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge , the noblest of all the gifts of the great institutions of learning is a certain fostering of elevation of mind . It is not so much by what he knows that the man brought under the trainings of the great academies is marked ; it is by his acquaintance with the size of knowledge ; with , if I may say so , the impossibility of completing its full circle ; with the acquaintance of the manners of enlarging his own boundaries ; with the respect of other knowledge than his own ; with a certain relative humility , as compared with the narrower pride of him who knows not the size of the spaces of the world of knowledge . And such an attitude of mind ; such an exaltation above petty prides ; such a belief in something larger than one 's self ; such an openness to the world , is the privilege of a full artistic development . The true artist is a man of culture insomuch as he is an artist ; he is a personification of culture , even if he be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , the peasant ? that is , the peasant of certain lands ? may be more capable of great culture than the little bourgeois above him who is already the result of some narrow form of civilization , and whose ideas are already secondary and not based on the simplest of human experiences . Moreover , whether we wish it or not , we shall be obliged to know more of the ways of thinking of other nations , as the whole world becomes more and more a single nation , divided by varying traditions and habits . In art , it will be impossible to avoid the influence of the further East . China and Japan , for instance , will have a great deal to say to us . We shall not be able to shut them out from the knowledge of our artists . As travel becomes more and more extended , more and more habitual to both rich and poor , as the photograph brings any fact from anywhere to us , we shall not be able to train our young minds in the only belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in or think best , we shall have to defend with a full knowledge of the other side . Therefore , we shall have to appeal to principles , to the development of history . And this previous " vaccination " will prevent the students , will prevent the younger minds from the influence of fashion , which is another form of commerce . There will be nothing any more strange and queer and quaint which can be copied and imitated , as unknown , and made a transient fad . The copy will have to be a copy of the qualities , not of the programme . All the more reason for hastening that day , as an acquaintance with the real things places the cheap imitations where they belong , not as anything wicked , not as anything immoral ? but as something cheap , meaning something whose essence is mean . One of the great causes of much of modern mediocrity in art has been this sudden invasion of novelty . Today there is no time to perfect the theory of any new special mode of art by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is presented . A distinguished English architect said to me : " After 1851 , the year of the great Exposition , which brought samples of all kinds of architectural features from various parts of the world , it was impossible to get in London a decent classical moulding of the average kind . " It was easier to make new designs , based on new patterns , whose incorrectness would be covered by their novelty . While , as long as only a few models were before the workman artist , his only chance of excellence was in the greater refinement of his work ; that is to say , and it is worth noticing , in the more accurate pursuit of the ideal of that pattern or form . When forms and modes of arrangement and types of beauty are well apprehended in principle , then only comes the triumph of execution . So that it is the very fact of the apprehension of the ideal which allows the practical to triumph . For example , let us say that we shall take an ornamented Greek moulding of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some detail of the Pandrosiom . The teaching that would be given by the university , removed from all desire of practice , would be the nearest to that given in the actual Greek work-shop where the moulding was made . And I regret to say that it would necessarily be contradictory to the usual teaching in the schools and museums ; and to the usual practice of the architect . To go on and explain this anomaly by insistence , I have actually seen , in a museum , such a fragment cast and repeated as if to show merely what the pattern was , from which the workman had worked , and produced something of his own ; for , of course , the workman being a Greek , and anyhow an artist , his pattern was simply a pattern , not more scared than a round or a square or a general direction , and it was in the make , in the actual feeling for the special curves , for the special lights and darks produced by these curves , that the beauty of the Greek ornament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the best , if there be any best , of similar modern work . Have I made this understood ? Commercially , fashionably , it would be foolish to do this particular ornament all fresh and new created as if never done by man before . But intellectually and artistically , the only excuse for a pattern of ornament is to give a chance to the person who makes it , or rather works from it , to express himself ; that is to say , to express his appreciation of , and delight in , the ideal of that pattern . As when the Japanese artist draws a twig , a branch ? the pattern of that branch he knows , the pattern of that willow , the pattern of that oak ? but , as he says , when you draw a branch , you must feel as though you were that branch yourself . That can not be taught in the ordinary teaching . It can only be taught from the two extremes : from one hand to the other of the artisan teacher and the artisan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the higher teachings regardless of usefulness . And what I say is so simple that minds accustomed to thought will hardly realize that in the practise of modern art such a statement would appear as novel as once did the explanations of Copernicus . By " ideal , " therefore , I do not mean a certain difference of pattern . I do not mean a particular pattern or what is called a " standard " carefully chosen out . Of course , in commerce , the handsome young man with the red hair , who spells art with a big A , is sure to say , " Oh , yes , madam , the ideal is this . Our No. 327 , " and he reaches it down from the shelf . No , I do n't mean that . The ideal of that pattern must vary according fo the race who carried it out , and the place and end it was for . It is no longer on the Pandrosiom as on the Parthenon ? nor is it the same in Sicily , nor again in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in further Japan . According to each mode of thought and civilization must it be different . It must vary according to the light , and according to the height , and according to whether it is to cut in or break more or less , to stop or to correct , to soothe , to sparkle , to distinguish or to pass over . It will be made to increase the effect of horizontal , or of perpendicular . The pattern will be the same , the thing will be different . So that the Greek could go on and copy that pattern over and over again , and make it perpetually new indefinitely for centuries . Yes , and though in white marble or in gray stone , it had more light and shade and more color than a whole French salon , and more artistic expression than a mass of sentimental modern English paintings put together . Try !  | Look at it when you are tired of having been through a modern show . It has carried the soul of some individual to you as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you heard the voice of the singer with the music that he followed . But one may say , we have not got the men who are men enough to do this . Yes , we have ; I can think of a dozen of them . Could not Mr. Saint Gaudens , Mr. Adams , Mr. French cut a good moulding ? But remember that we do not ask for the expression of an ideal in our modern art . We ask for the careful copying of a pattern . So that millions of dollars are spent on ornamentation upon which hundreds of thousands of men are employed ; all of which together are not worth a square inch of the good old work which reproduced carelessly sometimes , loosely perhaps , but reproduced an ideal . This goes so far that even the casting made by a Greek or a Japanese has more feeling than the original handwork of many of us moderns . That is to say again , that they followed not the accuracy of the pattern , but the accuracy of the ideal . If this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , on account of commerce , why should it not find a place in the university ? There are no objections to it there . There are no economic reasons why the ideal must not be sought for , there are no reasons in the university for being on time with the fashion or keeping up with the patterns that fashion places before us . In fact , the fashionable would be as ridiculous in the university as to be out of the fashion must be to the passing world that moves for the day only . Therefore , the art that stays would naturally belong to the teaching of the university ; that is to say , as long as it confined itself to ideals and not to patterns . For patterns again , are just as much the disease of the more ambitious expressions of art , as they are injurious to such modest divisions of artistic work ( as we have been thinking of ) when they were imitated , and not the ideal they , the patterns , were invented to express . Take , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary , apparently , in the history of religious art . As the type , that is to say , the pattern , becomes more distinct , we are warned in some way or other that the intention , that is to say , the ideal , has departed . The ends of the different great schools , tail each time into such examples . You can recall the persistent simper of the last Gothic prettiness ? the wooden classicality of the late Italians , the blowziness of the great Flemish deities and saints . And to-day in the decorative work liked in commercial England , and hence fashionable with us , the feminine types looked at with the eye of experienced life , recall the ladies so much admired by the sensuous gentlemen who inaugurated what has been called the " fleshly school " of art and literature ; the great eye and gross jaw and the heavy voluptuous lips dear to the painters who began with Mr. Maddox-Brown and ended with Sir Edward Burne-Jones . The dear ladies of modern English church work keep to this general moral view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes healthy , and when attenuated , more affected by amorous passion than ascetic life . So that the professional beauty and the ladies of the music halls are typified , and used as the pattern for Blessed Mary and Elizabeth . Do not misunderstand me , it is not the using of these persons themselves in representations that I object to , even if they be nasty ( which I am far from saying ) , because in them the divine soul can be followed . It is the working out of their pattern and their type . In the old work , far back , the artists also used the people around them . But somehow or other , they seem to have been usually impressed with a notion that out of those persons they must draw the possibilities , the highest human graces which could be lifted and informed by divine grace . According to the persons whom they had about them and whose type or pattern they had to adopt , they sought out in these various human compounds what they could give that was beautiful spiritually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more or less one kind of thing . It might be dignity , steadfastness , innocence , purity , tenderness , kindness , mercy , devotion . But it was not the pattern . It was a thing the pattern could help one to . So , there are big eyes and little eyes , and long noses and short noses , and thin faces and full faces , red hair , black hair , and brown hair , and paleness or color , and strength or weakness ; in each and all of these things , the artist looked underneath for what there  | might be , and did not allow the contradiction of the pattern to crush out these ideals within . You will see , therefore , that this is absolutely in contradiction to what is called " fashion , " and it represents the pursuit of the ideal through all the momentary changes which fashion may like or not like . And so , not trusting to the ideal , our age has been afflicted with the belief in the patterns that men call " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monumental splendor , for what has been called " religious expression , " now in pattern of the " Gothic , " now in pattern of the " round arch , " now in the horizontals and perpendiculars of the " classics . " Forgetful of the ideal which exists in all of them , forgetful of the special ideals which exist in each one of them , we have again trusted to sets of patterns . In the prevalence of these patterns was to be found the thing that would save one . Within no very distant memory most of us have gone through this experience ? and is it not time that we should be taught thereby ? Certainly , the proper teaching of a university ( necessarily contradictory to any one single development , because the study of history serves as a balance wheel ) ? certainly the teaching of a university could free us in the future by preventing our being surprised at the excellency of new patterns . They could all be classified and their motives explained , their technique separated from their intention , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saying that our own personal experience covers these changes of the fashion pattern in art . Nearly fifty years ago I was introduced to the reading of Ruskin , and the merits of the pointed styles . My mentor was an English clergyman steeped in the Oxford movement , and he directed me to the study of art from a point of view of admiration for medieval thought and a belief that therein was detained ( I mean within certain patterns was detained ) the living germ of religious art . You will see that I did not come from art to the church , but from the church to art . I lived long enough in a few years to realize that however necessary to understanding the history of art in the West such sympathies might be , they still narrowed the field of the application of man 's yearning for expression as connected with religion ? I mean , if these patterns that we admired so much were @# supposed to give all possible chance for religious sympathies and likings . Still , I never felt it necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the teacher and the admiring pupil , in those early days of boyish enthusiasm . It is the time of life that delights in exaggeration , and perhaps it should be supplied with occasional overstatements and with opportunities for letting the heart take a great share in the discussion of intellectual matters . Youth is beautiful , and the longer it can last the better for the man himself , even if the older man growing up within him realizes that he has responsibilities in thought which change the boundaries about which the youthful mind played freely . Even my good friends in Japan , my Buddhists , who told me also what to think about art as connected with religion , never really disturbed these first likings , though they helped me to change the form of my judgment . The ordinary world during this last half-century , came to see that religious art had existed before the flowering of mediaevalism . Again , I have been the witness of theories limiting the best expression of religious art to moments preceding the great Christian life of what used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , the architect , the decorator of churches , abandoning the " Gothic , " went back to the " Romanesque " patterns . The " round arch " began to have a sanctity similar to that which my first friend saw in the pattern of the pointed arch ? a mystic meaning , a perfection of religious expression as complete and more easily apprehended than that of pointed architecture . Perhaps to-day they may be going back as far as the forms of Byzantine civilization , which precedes and properly includes the beginnings of the Romanesque . Then it will be considered that the patterns belonging to these first established churches of Christianity show that external policy and too rapid crystallization of thought deteriorated the simplicity of early Christian art . And as early Christian art used the pagan symbols , which it found ready to its hand , I should not be surprised if it were asserted that within these pagan symbols we might find enough to touch us with the association of the very beginning of the preaching of the New Light . You will see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecclesiasticism of the twelfth , thirteenth , fourteenth and fifteenth centuries , as we follow out the patterns that I sketch roughly . It might be interesting in connection with what I have just said of a vital principle and ideal filling with life a pattern apparently antagonistic , to see what has happened in the monuments of a great religion ? a religion which has curious analogies to Christianity , however different its theological theory may be . I refer to the singular late discoveries which show that Greek forms are the first under which are depicted the doctrine and the life of Buddha , Sakyamuni . A form was necessary , and the Greek patterns , antagonistic as their origin might be , were ready to hand . Hence , the Buddha , draped like a Greek god , with ornaments and architectural details borrowed from a religion essentially different in its manifestations ; so that the most joyous and clearest and narrowest of artistic expressions was used for the most abstruse , pessimistic , and least joyous of all manners of religion . From that origin , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East and are continued yet in the Buddhistic art of Japan , the only country , with China , in which Buddhism . has flourished to this day in free intercourse with human life . In the evolution of art as " hand-maid of religion " under Buddhistic ecclesiasticism , as for example , in Thibetan art , we see the gradual formalizing which separates art from life . Little by little , formulas are established and patterns approved of by the clergy , which are less and less sympathetic to the layman and gradually not understood by him , however full of meaning they really are . The images of the gods , socalled , or more correctly , of the attributes of the divinity as they come from the Thibetan work-shop or have been derived from Mongol influence , seem to us horrible , disagreeable , monstrous , and heartless ; and they are so ; that is to say , they are pure patterns apart from human life , they are records in plastic art of an attempt at representing pure thought . The Eastern holy man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is fully satisfied with these queer and complicated assemblages of forms , each detail of which establishes some theological statement . He has attained further than we have ? in the dissociation of art from its natural birthplace and home : the Heart of Man , and is obliged to continue without change or progress , because the human element of sympathy has been eliminated by the pure worship of the pattern . We might see , then , that the consideration of such a detail as an ornamental pattern would involve so many issues as to touch all the special deposits of knowledge ; in short , to be a little epitome of a university training . It might be hoped that just within the university such disinterested study could be carried out , because it would have no commercial end , and be merely valuable for the development of the mind . And I take it that the training of universities is not to prepare merely for some special function in the world , but to allow the mind to understand what these functions are . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practise of the plastic arts was not the pursuit that a great many of them were meant for . In every case , however , both for those who practised , and for those who did not , a larger human development would be possible ? would be natural . The work of art which is final in itself and disinterested is not only a collection of signs which indicate the psychology of its maker ; the work of art is a collection of signs which shall reveal the soul of its admirers , to themselves certainly ? and later , in a mode of history , to us who can thus partake in the past without being entangled in all its notions . Our own notions , which belong to our own time , can be purified and exalted by this contact . The teaching of the classics in all nations which have classics , has continued on that account . I have lightly touched upon the possible development of a study of architecture , and , consequently , of decoration , which should be freed from daily necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative use that crushes , for instance , the so-called French School , which would prevent the narrower mind from its habit of dictation , and at the same time would strengthen the man born for greater things , by assuring him that the voice of the spirit which he hears within him is the same voice that has spoken to the Fathers . You will consider all that I am saying as a mere meditation , not an attempt at the orderly proving of some proposition . It would be  | for minds more competent to judge of systems , to lay out the possible geography which I dream of . But it is singular that in all the departments of art we still need larger teaching . Take , for instance , a form of art which has interested me personally , and of which there are eminent representatives , already in universities , engaged in the very work of preparing the young mind to understand the possible development of painting . It was brought to me but a few months ago that we still had no codified history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of the head of an Imperial School of Art , asking me in what work I would find an explanation of the European art of painting . And I had to tell him that there was no such work ; that , perhaps , after all , it would have to be written by a Japanese . I explained that we were entangled , practically as artists , in many conflicting traditions for which a general solution had not been formulated . That , in the first place , as he knew , European art had at a certain moment actually undertaken scientific study as necessary to its own development ; that one of its great leaders had abandoned art for a scientific view of the world . I meant Leonardo . That many of the early students of anatomy were among the artists . That our art of painting had involved gradually the use of everything that the sight could employ ? things which the Japanese had done without . That modern art , for instance , was now entangled with scientific studies of light and color , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basis of all painting . We had , I told him , no adequate account of these developments . I told him that for each transition in our art of painting there had been necessarily special technical developments , even down to the different uses of paints , of canvases or surfaces to paint on , or brushes to paint with , and that from his own special Japanese knowledge he would know that an appreciation of these details was inseparable from the results . We had , it is true , certain historic accounts of the use of pigments and materials , but that they were especially unknown to painters ; and also , that these accounts were in the form of chronicles ? if one might say so ? and not based on any general theory of the necessities implied in each case . We had , as they had in Japan , histories of certain painters , and that of late ( as in Japan ) attention was being paid to the methods of certain painters , so that the manner of their expression by the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being classified . But that only a very little had been done this way . Also , that we were only beginning now to connect the artist with his surroundings in the accounts of him ; and also that we were very slowly recognizing the opposite side ; that is , the intimate personality of each prominent artist , which had determined , after all , the particular appeal to our soul made by each one . That some of the most illustrious were only beginning to be understood ; that the most famous of all , Michael Angelo , was only just beginning to be disentangled from the use that so little were the necessities of art understood , that only a little while ago I had seen remarked in the catalogue of the great Rembrandt show in London , that he , Rembrandt , had made special use in his pictures of the people who surrounded him , and even , strange to say , had used his own portrait ; and this as if it were some special personal trait and not the history of every artist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no general history of the development of painting as caused by the necessities of the time , the use of materials , and the mental and physical make-up of the artist . Therefore , I urged him to incite some Japanese to do such a thing : all the more that they were disinterested and had not to undertake the defence or the praise of anything , because of outside reasons . I said to him , also , that the appreciation of quality , which was the great factor in the artistic criticism of Japan , had become less and less important to us , and that even we cared little for the lasting of our work , and more yet , that in decorative work the commercial spirit had so taken hold of us , that we prepared it so that it might not last long . I told him how regardless architects were of the quality of materials used , and that few , if any , would prefer a wall painted by Titian to a wall painted by any commercial firm , provided it cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Japanese to our rescue . @#  | Now , these epigrams , these short-hand statements of facts , were built of the solid truth . Comprehensive study of one of the arts of which we know the most , has yet to be made . What more splendid object could there be for the great net of university teaching ! The mere scheming-out of such a system of study would encourage special students to take up each successive detail in a logical connection . It might be , as it were , a Psychological history , a scientific , a sociological one , and necessarily touch the most practical points of the most mechanical of all the arts . As it has been in Japan , even the ordinary house-painter and paper stainer could not escape the result of better general teaching . Perhaps I am but dreaming , but our dreams often come true when we are much interested , and certainly no one can be injured by dreams that tend to elevate our intentions and make us sympathize with the life of a greater part of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see more meanly . That side has always taken care of itself . Perhaps , also , there may be some special excuses for indulging in the ideas of a greater synthesis , as I have hinted before . The world is to be more and more connected , and the great oceans will not divide the minds of men as much as did formerly an ordinary stream or a mountain chain . Indeed , they are the pathways of that very commerce whose bad sides the university as a type of disinterestedness can abate , diminish , turn aside . That very commerce is to be a help to larger ideas and better understandings . It is only necessary , I think , to cultivate distinctly the differences between choice and necessity ? between the pursuit of an ideal and the pursuit of momentary advantage which is based , of course , on momentary necessities . As I said before , commerce itself will help us against itself . I can look forward to a day when the very level of art will be raised through enormous vulgarization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come when , as in Japan , the ordinary house-servant would consider as habitual not only the art of the Far East in its better forms , but something better than the West is yet able to produce . I think we see some promise of that to-day in the ordinary objects of home use . If the mass of what is produced by ordinary trade can only be well lumped together , all the more reason that the finer qualities may serve their purpose . There must come a day , too , when Fashion begins to stand still , as it has in the East , upon the levels solidly deposited . That is an influence that may do us quite as much good as the teaching of the East now backing upon us conquerors , in the recognition of force as the only real basis of right . A general consensus of culture may allow more play for special varieties worth preserving . A general consensus of culture would increase the reasonableness of the artist , and thereby bring him more really into harmonious appreciation of the greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me quote something I was reading lately in the Journal of a great painter whose fiery genius was not cramped , but helped , by the kind of culture which I am advocating , and in which he believed also ; a man , too , as fully removed from the commercial side of art as this or any century has given . I mean Delacroix . It is written in one of his note-books , along with the usual facts of a very prudent , economizing , and wellordered life . He was a great admirer of many English painters , and with the greatest facility took in Reynolds , Gainsborough , and Turner ( whom he had known personally ) , and Holman Hunt and the modern pre-Raphaelites . Criticising certain imitations as injurious and unreasonable because they do not belong to the unity of the paintings he speaks of , he explains to himself how they are the cause of a certain unnaturalness which attends the works of so many English artists who are , in reality , naturalists . This is what he says : " True @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might seem an exception , is in reality within his own genius , and has no exaggerations but those which are in the direction of his own ideas and always founded upon the observation of Nature . Those who have thought that the bizarre is a mark of talent are but shadows of artists . The greatest genius is always a being who is extremely reasonable , even if his reasonableness is not at the moment understood . " To anyone who knows the impassioned works of this great painter , it will be a sort of proof of the truthfulness of my belief . He was a man of great general training , and of a curiosity for every  | variety of thought and information which his good sense , also cultured , taught him to limit ; because he had decided that of all his curiosities , art was the one best suited for himself , and for which he had to reserve the greater part of his strength . Nor have I known of any important artist who did not believe in intellectual training . Even the accidental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , make in themselves a kind of education , and that from the Chinese or the Greek to the savings of the men of to-day . I had almost hoped that some day a kind of dictionary , an authoritative series of definitions for almost everything relating to the art of painting , might be made out of these fragments scattered almost everywhere . The meaning , at least , of such a dictionary , such an encyclopedia , could be carried out by the university . Instead of being a series of pages of paper contained within a certain number of volumes , it might be a series of studies covering many years , but all of them made within the protection of the varying forms of thought which belong to the great names that stand out among the schools of the past . Here , then , in such a place as the university , which is not so much a physical as a spiritual existence , might my dream come true . Here could be planted for art that great useless tree of fixed knowledge . It could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for elegant veneers . But its seeds could be planted elsewhere , to grow up and give rest and shade and fruit . The studies of the architectures of the past would not be the studies of patterns , but the studies of thoughts which necessitated the patterns , and for which physical material had to be used . Therein the studies of other sciences would help the understanding and the development of these means to an end . In the same way , for such an art as my art of painting , the physical sciences would explain the nature whose patterns we painters use . It would explain the choice of our materials , and the study of our history would show how they came to be used . We would see the human soul , which is the essential material of which art is made , developed in individuals , sometimes in harmony with the souls around them , sometimes in opposition to them . We should see how " art is not the attempt ing of Art 18i at reflecting others , at taking possession of others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attempt at keeping possession of one 's self . It is often a protest at what is displeasing and mean about us ? it is an appeal to what is better ; it is an appeal to the permanent reality in presence of the transient ; it is an attempt to rest for a moment in the true way . " For however often the work of art represents the present , the moods of feeling of the future are as often reflected by it as the habits of the moment . And the artist must have had partners , since he has had admirers , even when he antagonizes his time . However transient certain of his forms , however much to us who come afterward they indicate the period , he has expressed not his time , but the needs of others who have been looking in the same ways , and yet have had no voice . And if they have not quite understood , yet this accumulation of tendency has become stronger and clearer in their descendants . To explain folly , then , the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melt into it in some way the gaze of those who had looked at it . Their negations or their sympathies have fallen on the work , and these affections of the soul are carried clown to us on these surfaces of material . The most spiritual teachings could coexist according to my dream , with the most careful training in the knowledge of the reason of physical processes . For that , in other words , is another definition of the work of art . Always the technique has struggled to be equal to the spiritual intention and nothing could be more easy proof of it than the work of Rembrandt . In that union of the different arts which we call decoration , we should be taught again the real place of the pattern . We should know that the spirit of the Middle Ages is not called up by the mere intersection of the curves which make the pointed arch . The persistence of perpendicular and horizontal , which can be obtained by the T-square and the foot-rule , would never seem to us to be classical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a necessity and not an object . We should learn to follow out what might be the true intention , solemnity , or of grace , or fervor , or peace , some kind of human emotion . And as we know that these are not purchaseable , we  | should not look to obtain them in commercial warehouses of knowledge . There can be no Macy 's for the intellectual and the moral . For all the transient outside , for all the commercial , there would then be no wasted effort at improvement , no indignation at its being what it is . All that enormous side of practical art which provides the tradesman with things to supply the momentary fashions , would drift entirely out of the student 's vision . The touchstone can always be applied which determines whether the work or the object we look at is made for us ? that is to say , for sale to us in some manner of flattery ? or whether it is made for itself , independent of us , which is the only way by which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this country especially we must for a long time be victims of the necessity of trade ; of its need to handle art as well as other things , and as in other matters that are for sale , even votes , what we need to know is the danger , and it is for us to be out of reach . Even in questions of the most ordinary taste , apart from principle and tradition , the wise man knows this , for taste might partly be defined as a sort of experience of life . I must have been deficient in the treating of a subject whose edges are so indefinite , but I feel almost sure that what I have said is an appeal to the possibilities . I have not tried to say anything new . In the consideration of the teaching of what is permanent , that is not necessary . And , for my part , I should be ashamed if I could not be approved and understood by my Egyptian colleagues and fellow-workmen of six thousand years ago .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
