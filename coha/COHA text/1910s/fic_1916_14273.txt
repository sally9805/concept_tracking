SCENE : Workroom at Fanny Segal 's . A door to the left of the spectator , another in the back . A large table , covered with various materials ; at each side of the table a sewing machine . On the wall to the right , a three-panelled mirror ; in the corner , a large wardrobe . Not far from the wardrobe two dressmaker 's forms , covered with cloaks . In the middle a broad armchair . Evening . FANNY runs out through the rear door and soon returns with a letter in her hand . She tears it nervously open and is absorbed in reading . Suddenly she gives a scream of delight . Oh !  --  Oh ! Passes her hand over her face and through her hair , looks at the letter , cries out anew , breathing with difficulty . Looks at the letter once more , and exclaims heavily . You ! My love ! My love ! She is lost for a moment in thought , then calls . Lizzie ! Lizzie ! Lizzie ! LIZZIE enters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pin in her hat . Mocks Fanny 's tone . What 's up ? What 's up ? What 's up ? FANNY Read this ! Quickly ! It 's from Berman ! LIZZIE takes the letter . Why see ! We 've just been talking about him . And they really accepted his drama ? Looks at the letter. p. 3 FANNY looks on , too , in great excitement . LIZZIE as she reads . That 's fine ! Turns over a page and continues reading . Why ! This is an actual proposal if marriage , Fanny , my dear ! FANNY her breath short from delight . Did you understand it that way , too ? LIZZIE still looking at the letter . How can it be interpreted otherwise ? About to read the letter aloud . Ahem ! Reads with a certain solemnity . " My drama has been accepted and will be produced this very winter . The conditions of the contract are first-rate , and the director promises me a great success , and incidentally a great reputation . " Reads over some passages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My ! You ought to see me now .  --  I 've sung and danced so much that it 'll be a wonder to me if I 'm not asked to move . I feel so strong . And now to write , to create , to do things ! " Reads again in a nasal monotone , and soon with greater solemnity than before , and a certain tenderness . " And now , I hope , better days are in store for us , happiness of such a nature that you can not be indifferent to it . " Stops reading . That 's a bit veiled , but it 's plain talk just the same . Gives Fanny the letter . Speaks lovingly . Lucky woman ! My darling Fanny ! Embraces her . You dear ! Kisses her. p. 4 FANNY So that 's the way you understand it , too ? Speaks in gasps , trembling all over . Oh ! Oh ! Covers her face with the letter , takes it to her lips and breathes with difficulty . She takes from her right sleeve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embracing her with both arms . My dear Fanny ! How happy I am ! You dear , you ! Dreamily . Now I know how I 'll play at the Ginsbergs ' to-night ! I 'll put my whole soul into the music , and it will be the merriest , cheeriest soul that ever lived in the world . FANNY bends down and kisses her forehead . My faithful friend ! LIZZIE At last ! My dream 's come true ! FANNY drops into the armchair . Your dream ? LIZZIE takes a piece of cloth from the table , spreads it out on the floor , and kneels before Fanny . Listen . I dreamed for you a hero before whom the world , even before seeing him , would bare its head . I dreamed for you a triumphal march of powerful harmonies , a genius , a superman , such as only you deserve . FANNY Sh ! Sh ! Do n't talk like that ! p. 5 LIZZIE No , no . You ca n't take that away from me . As long as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't many sisters in the world like you . Why , you never have given a thought to yourself , never a look , but have worked with might and main to make a somebody out of your sister . I 'll tell you the truth . I 've often had the most unfriendly feelings toward your sister Olga . She takes it so easy there in Petrograd , while you  --  FANNY tenderly . You 're a naughty girl . LIZZIE I simply could n't see how things went on ,  --  how you were working yourself to death . FANNY But that was my happiness , and now I am amply repaid for it , to see Olga placed upon an independent footing , with a great future before her as a painter . LIZZIE That kind of happiness did not appeal very much to me . I wanted , for you , a different kind of happiness ,  --  the happiness of being a wife , of being a mother , of loving and being loved . FANNY in a reverie . I had already weaned my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness . LIZZIE You poor soul ! FANNY When my mother died , my road was clearly mapped out for me : to be to my sister , who is eight years younger than I , both a father and a mother . That purpose was great and holy to me . I never thought of anything else . Only in the early twenties , between twenty-two and twenty-five , a longing for something else came to me . Not that my sister became a burden to me , God forbid , but I wanted something more , a full life , happiness and  --  love . At that time I used to cry very much , and wet my pillow with my tears , and I was very unhappy . And I was easily angered then , too , so you see I was far from an angel . p. 6 LIZZIE draws Fanny nearer , and kisses her . You darling , you ! FANNY But later the longing left me , as if it had been charmed away . Olga grew older , and her talents began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became again my sole concern . LIZZIE And is that all ? FANNY What else can there be ? Of course , when my sister went to Petrograd she was no longer under my immediate care and I was left all alone . The old longing re-awoke in my bosom but I told myself that one of my years had no right to expect happiness and love ? So I determined to tear out , to uproot from my heart every longing . I tried to convince myself that my goal in life had already been attained  --  that I had placed a helpless child securely upon her feet  --  LIZZIE But you loved Berman all the time , did n't you ? FANNY Yes , I loved him all the time , but I fought my feelings . Life had taught me to restrain and to suppress my desires . I argued : He is too far above me  --  LIZZIE Too far above you ? FANNY continuing . And I am too worn-out for him . And furthermore , I tried to make myself believe that his daily visits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me at all , but for his friend and nephew Hindes , who happens to board with me. p. 7 LIZZIE But how could you help perceiving that he was something more than indifference to you ? You must have been able to read it in his eyes . FANNY smiling . Well , you see how it is ! And perhaps for the very reason that I had abandoned all ideas of love , and had sought to deceive myself into believing that I was a dried-up twig on the tree of live  --  LIZZIE jumping up . My ! How you sinned against yourself ! FANNY rising . But now the sap and the strength flow again within me ,  --  now I am young once more .  --  Ah ! Life , life !  --  To enjoy it , to drink it down in copious draughts , to feel it in every pulse-beat  --  Oh , Lizzie , play me a triumphal march , a song of joy , of jubilation LIZZIE So that the very walls will dance and the heavens join in the chorus . Goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joy , thou goddess , fair , immortal , daughter of Elysium , Mad with rapture  --  " Suddenly stops . Sh ! Hindes is coming ! Listens . FANNY she has been standing as if entranced ; her whole body trembles as she awakens to her surroundings . She puts her finger to her nose , warningly . Do n't say a word to him about it . p. 8 LIZZIE I will ! He must know it , he must be happy over it , too . And if he truly loves you , he will be happy to learn it . And then , once for all he 'll get rid of his notions about winning you . FANNY Do n't be so inconsiderate . LIZZIE Leave it to me ! Hindes ! Hindes ! FANNY It 's high time you left for the Ginsbergs ' . LIZZIE I 've a few minutes yet Hindes ! Hindes ! HINDES appears at the rear door . He wears spectacles ; under his left arm a crutch , under his right arm books , and in his hands various bags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left . HINDES Good evening . What 's the news ? LIZZIE Come here ! Quick ! Fa  --  HINDES Wo n't you give me time to carry my parcels into my room ? LIZZIE Not even a second ! Fanny has  --  HINDES taking an apple from a bag . Have an apple . LIZZIE refusing it . Let me speak , wo n't you ! Fa  --  p. 9 HINDES May I at least sit down ? LIZZIE loudly . Fanny has received a letter from Berman ! HINDES taking a seat . Saying that his drama has been accepted . I , too , have received a letter from Berman . LIZZIE That 's nothing . The point is that he is seeking to make a match with her . He has practically proposed to her . HINDES astonished . Practically proposed ? To Fanny ? LIZZIE Yes , and when Fanny comes back you just see to it that you wish her a right friendly congratulation , and that you make no  --  Stops suddenly . Hm ! I came near saying something silly .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just have the whole world happy with me . Do you hear ? You must help her celebrate , do you hear ? And now , good night to you , for I must run along to the Ginsbergs ' . Turns to the door at the left singing : " Joy , thou goddess , fair , immortal " HINDES calling after her . But  --  the devil . Miss Ehrlich ! LIZZIE at the door . I have n't a single moment to spare for the devil . She disappears. p. 10 HINDES grunts angrily , throws his crutch to the ground , places his books and his packages on a chair , and mumbles . What mockery is this ! Takes out a letter from his inside pocket and reads it over several times . Grunts again . Rests his head heavily upon his hands , and looks vacantly forward , as if deeply puzzled . FANNY enters , embarrassed . Good evening , Hindes ! HINDES mumbles , without changing his position . Good evening ! FANNY looks at him in embarrassment , and begins to busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same position . He taps his foot nervously . He soon ceases this , and speaks without looking at Fanny . Miss Segal , will you permit me to see Berman 's letter ? FANNY with a nervous laugh . That 's a bit indiscreet  --  not at all like a cavalier . HINDES same position and same tone . Will you permit me to see Berman 's letter ? FANNY with a laugh of embarrassment , throws him the letter , which she has been holding in her sleeve . Read it , if that 's how you feel . p. 11 HINDES bends slowly down , gets the letter , commences to read it , and then to grumble . H 'm ! So ! He lets the letter fall to his knee , and stares vacantly before him . He shakes his foot nervously and mumbles as if to himself . To be such an idiot ! FANNY regards him with astonishment . HINDES somewhat more softly . To be such an idiot ! FANNY laughing , still embarrassed . Who ? HINDES Not I. Picks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arises , and gives the letter to Fanny . FANNY beseechingly . Hindes , do n't take it so badly . You make me very sad . HINDES I 'm going to my room , so you wo n't see me . FANNY as before . Do n't speak to me like that , Hindes . Be my good friend , as you always were . In a lower tone , embarrassed . And be good to Berman . For you know , between us , between you and me , there could never have been anything more than friendship . HINDES There is no need of your telling me that . I know what I know and have no fault to find with you . p. 12 FANNY Then why are you so upset , and why do you reproach yourself ? HINDES Because FANNY Because what ? HINDES after an inner struggle , stormily . Because I am in a rage ! To think of a chap writing such a veiled , ambiguous , absolutely botched sentence , and cooking up such a mess ! FANNY What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Segal , what my feelings are toward you , and you know that I wish you all happiness . I assure you that I would bury deep within me all my grief and all my longing , and would rejoice with a full heart  --  if things were as you understood them from Berman 's letter . FANNY As I understood them from Berman 's letter ? HINDES And what rouses my anger and makes me hesitate is that it should have had to happen to you and that I must be the surgeon to cut the cataract from your eye . FANNY astounded . Drop your rhetorical figures . End your work . Cut away , since you 've begun the cutting . HINDES without looking at her , deeply stirred . Berman did not mean you . p. 13 FANNY Not me ? HINDES Not you , but your sister . FANNY with an outcry . Oh !  --  HINDES He writes me that his first meeting with her was as if the splendor of God had suddenly shone down upon him ,  --  that gradually he was inflamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love is returned , that FANNY falls upon a chair , her face turned toward the table . She breaks into moaning . She has taken from me everything ! In deepest despair , with cries from her innermost being , she tears at her hair . HINDES drops his books and packages to the floor . Limps over to Fanny , and removes her hands from her head . You have good reason to weep , but not to harm yourself . FANNY hysterically . She has taken from me everything ! My ambition to study , my youth , my fondest hopes , and now HINDES And now ?  --  Nothing . As you see , Berman never loved you . If it had n't been for that unfortunate , ambiguous , absolutely botched , simply idiotic sentence FANNY softly . Hindes , I feel that I no longer care to live . p. 14 HINDES Folly ! FANNY I feel as if my heart had been torn in two . My soul is empty , desolate as if an abyss had opened before me What have I now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HINDES Folly ! Nonsense ! FANNY I have already lived my life HINDES Absurd ! FANNY resolutely . I know what I 'm talking about , and I know what to do . Silence . HINDES regarding her closely . With blunt emphasis . You 're thinking now over what death you shall choose . FANNY motionless . HINDES taking a seat . Let me tell you a story . There was once upon a time a man who  --  not through doubt and misfortune , but rather through good times and pleasures , came to the conclusion that life was n't worth living . So he went off to buy a revolver . On his way a great clamor arose in the street . A house had caught fire and in a moment was in flames . Suddenly , at one of the windows in the top story there appeared a woman . The firemen had placed their highest ladders against the building and a man began to climb up . That man was none other than our candidate for suicide . He took the woman out of the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , and then went through the window into the house . The surrounding crowd trembled with fear lest the house should cave in at the very last moment . Flames already appeared at the window , and people were sure that the hero had been burned to death inside . But he had not been burned ; he soon appeared on the roof , with a small child in his arms . The ladders could not reach to this height , so the firemen threw him a rope . He tied the rope about the child and lowered it to the firemen . But he himself was beyond rescue . He folded his hands over his heart , and tears trickled from his eyes . He , who but a moment before had sought death , now desired not to die . No , he wanted to live , for in that moment he had found a purpose : to live and to do good . p. 15 FANNY angrily . To do good ! I 'm tired of doing good ! HINDES Do n't sin against yourself , Fanny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have lived for others , not myself ; and now you can see for yourself that I have not fulfilled my life . I feel as wretched as the most miserable , as the most wicked , and I long for death even as the most unhappy ! HINDES looking at her from under his spectacles . Does Olga know of your feelings toward Berman ? FANNY angrily . I do n't know what she knows . HINDES Ca n't you give me any better reply than that ? FANNY What can I know ? I used to write her letters just full of Berman . HINDES Could Olga have gathered from them that you were not Indifferently disposed toward him ? FANNY What do you mean by this cross-examination ? HINDES I have a notion that if you were to do what you have in your mind at present ,  --  a thing I can not bring myself to name ,  --  then Olga would not accept Berman 's love . Rather she would take her own life , since she would look upon herself as the cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've thought up ? HINDES Just what you heard . FANNY And you mean  --  ? HINDES  --  That you know your sister and ought to realize what she 's liable to do . FANNY in a fit of anger . First she takes away my life , and now she will not let me die ! Her head sinks to the table . HINDES There spoke the true Fanny , the Fanny of yore . FANNY weeps bitterly . HINDES Well may you weep . Weep , Fanny , weep until the tears come no more . But when that is over , then dry your eyes and never weep again . Dry forever the source of all your tears . That 's exactly what I did , do you understand ? Such people as you and I , robbed of personal happiness , must either weep forever , or never weep at all . I chose the latter course . Harden yourself , Fanny , and then fold your arms on your breast and look fearlessly forward into life , fulfilling it as your heart dictates . FANNY continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , takes it up and throws it down angrily . Such a botched , idiotic sentence ! And he 's a poet ! p. 17 FANNY raising her head . If things are as you say , then Olga will in any case reject Berman . She will imagine that she is taking him away from me , and such a thing she would never do . HINDES Perhaps . Suddenly , bluntly . And what will be the effect of all this upon you ? FANNY brokenly . Who 's thinking of self ? I mean that I want her to have him . HINDES There 's the old Fanny again ! FANNY Ah ! Enough of that ! Better help me with some suggestion . HINDES Some suggestion ? Be her matchmaker . FANNY And suppose she should turn the tables and want to be my matchmaker ? HINDES We 've got to think that over . Silence . FANNY brokenly . Hindes ! HINDES What ? FANNY I have an idea . HINDES Good . FANNY But I need your aid . HINDES Count on me , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? HINDES Blindly ? FANNY Blindly . HINDES looks at her . Why must I promise you blindly ? If I 'm able , you may be sure I 'll help . FANNY brokenly , yet in embarrassment . Take me Marry me . HINDES for a moment he looks at her , then picks up his crutch , his books and the packages . FANNY beseechingly . Hindes ! If I should marry , Olga would n't have any obstacle in her way . HINDES Miss Segal , I have loved you , and still do . But I refuse to be the altar upon which you shall sacrifice yourself . FANNY But a moment ago you dissuaded me from death . Will you now drive me back to it ? HINDES Your sister will be able to find happiness without Berman . FANNY But if she loves him ?  --  HINDES Then she 'll suffer , just as we do . FANNY No ! Olga must not suffer ! Do you hear ! I 'll not have it ! p. 19 HINDES That is very nice of you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you . HINDES turns toward the door . Good night . FANNY is overcome by sobbing . HINDES limps to the door , then stops . Looks downwards , then raises his eyes toward Fanny . Miss Segal , why is it that during all the time that I have boarded with you I have made no declaration of love , that I have never proposed marriage ? FANNY weeps . HINDES I 'll tell you . Was n't it because I knew that you did n't love me , and because I wanted your love , not merely your respect ? FANNY firmly . No . You did n't do it simply because you knew that I would refuse you . HINDES And suppose I expected " Yes " from you ? FANNY Then you would have proposed . HINDES And married you without your love ? FANNY Yes . HINDES But then I did n't know that you loved another . p. 20 FANNY brokenly . The other no longer exists for me . HINDES looks again at the floor . Silence . FANNY Hindes ! HINDES Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lame . FANNY Put all your bundles aside . HINDES hesitates for a moment , then puts down his books and packages . FANNY as if in embarrassment . Everything Everything HINDES bluntly . Do n't be ashamed . Say just what you mean : Lay aside the crutch , too . He lays aside the crutch . FANNY arises , takes his hand . Hindes , you know my attitude toward you . You know how highly I esteem you , how happy I 've always been to possess in you a good , true friend Nestles her head against him , coyly . Embrace me , and give me a kiss , a hot , passionate kiss . Put into it your whole love , make it express your whole true soul . Brokenly , and in tears . I tell you , our life will be  --  happy . We souls , forgotten by happiness , will yet find it  --  in our own way  --  as best we can . Less tearfully . You 'll see how it 'll soon be . Lizzie will come home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march of joy Brokenly . She owes it to me ! I 'll dance , I tell you ; I 'll dance for two . You 'll see . And I 'll sing . I 'll turn things upside down . Hindes , kiss me , hotly , hotly . p. 21 HINDES passionately , through tears . You You He gives her a long kiss , as if entranced.
