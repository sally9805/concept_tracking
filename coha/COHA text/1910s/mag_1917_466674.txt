CALL the birds famil-iar in the sense that they make themselves very much at home in our midst , and not in the sense that their lives become story and fail to arouse our It is a story perpetually retold , with endless variations . After you have named them all and have made yourself acquainted with their various characters and habits , your next walk to the fields and woods or along the highway or about your own dooryard may reveal some new trait in finch or thrush , or some significant incident in their lives that kindles your interest afresh . The birds are pioneers that begin the world anew all about us each season , and their lives touch and cross ours at new points at all times . They are always the same familiar birds , the birds of our youth , but they are new as the flowers are new , as the spring and summer are new , as each morning is new . Like Nature herself they are , endowed with immortal youth , and always present to us an endless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first bluebird , the first song-sparrow , the first phoebe , the first swallow , is an event which we mention to our neighbor , or write in our letters to our friends . It is an old story with a new interest . The birds have lived , and we have lived to meet again the old scenes . They bring us once more the assurance of the unfailing return of spring , and the never-ending joy and fecundity of life . Many of them are very likely the identical robins or songsparrows that charmed us last season , but they come back to us with a new story to tell , and new service to render . They have passed the winter in strange lands , and we may have done so , too ; but now , on the home acres , our lives meet and mingle once more . Does that brief visitation in May of the rarer warblers ever become an old story ? We do not see them when they come , nor when they depart ; they are here eagerly feeding in the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven with the rising sun , as doubtless they did ; and they are gone in a day or two , as if they had vanished again in the heavens at the going down of the sun , as is very surely the case . All night they travel through the trackless upper air above the sleeping earth , their pole-star that mysterious instinct to multiply and replenish the earth . Unfavorable weather conditions will cause them to tarry longer with us some seasons than others . This season , 5916 , the bay-breasted , the Blackburnian , andthe Canada warblers lingered nearly a week with us . The veery , or Wilson 's i thrush , lingered and sang in unwonted places . Yesterday I walked in my neighbor 's woods and orchards and saw many of these passing warblers ? the baybreasted , the black-capped , the magnolia , the black-throated blue , and others . How fresh they looked ! They seemed just to have stepped out of Audubon . They conferred a new dignity upon the trees ? those old , commonplace scenes , and then this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all was ! The male scarlet tanager down in the plowed field ? a vivid bit of color upon the brown earth ? how it delighted the eye ! A cuckoo called and called in a maple , and then launched out in the air and flew down the hill , its long tail , its slender body , its thin wings , and its characteristic movements ? how strange when contrasted with the other birds ! so different from them all ! A robin made a drive at it in the tree , which is a hint that the cuckoo is a criminal among the birds probably at times destroying their eggs , as has been alleged of it . Do we ever outgrow the charm and the wonder of the first song-sparrow 's nest on the ground , tucked away under the grass , or hidden under a mossy bank ? a bit of the waste and litter of the great crude out-of-doors taking such neat and pretty shape , and holding such delicate , pearl-like bodies ? Can we behold it without a fresh thrill of pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its midst this delicate , living treasure which a passing foot may crush , or some prowling enemy destroy . What trust , what peril , what artless art it all suggests ! The April or May day when I find a song-sparrow 's nest has a touch that the other days do not have ; and if a spring goes by without my finding ' tine or more , I miss something from my life . It is not usually by searching that we find a sparrow 's nest ; it is by accident , or by patient waiting . The past season I found my first treasure by patient waiting . I have found scores of the nests of this familiar dooryard songster , but none that ever gave me more pleasure than this one . The cautious little ground-builder betrayed the secret of her nest to me when , humanly speaking , she thought she was securely keeping it . I knew there was a nest near my study by the song of the male on the trees and bushes around me , and had made some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first have some sort of a clue to a nest . As I sat here in the summer-house one afternoon with only the most vague thoughts about birds , I chanced to see a song-sparrow flit out of the grass near the border of the just-plowed vineyard , alight upon the freshly turned earth , and in a fussy , nervous way go hunting about for food . Have you ever seen a setting hen come off the nest to feed , and noted how she fluffs out her feathers , flirts her tail , and hurries about as if in ill-humor ? My little hen sparrow acted in the same way , and I instantly inferred that she had just left her nest in the grass a few yards below me . She fussed about on the ground for a few minutes , and then flew away , and disappeared in the vineyard . In ten minutes or so she returned to the bit of plowed ground where I first saw her , and went through the same fussy , nervous maneuvers as at first . Then she came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a few seconds , hopping about amid the branches , and going down to the ground as if in quest of food , mindful all the time , I could see , of my presence . Then she flew back to the plowed land again , and hopped about , very watchful and suspicious , it seemed to me . She then came a few feet up into the grass and alighted on a small , dry maple branch that had fallen from the trees above . Here she flirted and attitudinized a moment or two , and then came to the rose-bush again and repeated her former movements ; then hack to the plowed ground , then to the dry branch where she sat still and considered a moment , and then hopped down in the grass and disappeared from my view . As she did not again appear , I knew she had gone to her nest . Presently I moved down there very carefully , and , scanning the ground closely , lest I step on the nest , I began the search . When I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be completely hidden , I heard a rustle in some dry leaves , and saw a rapidly moving line of shaking grassstems as the bird ran from her nest . Then I concentrated my gaze upon the ground and searched it inch by inch , but no nest could I see . Orchard grass grew there in tussocks or stools , and on the lower side of these stools the dry grass of last year sloped down , forming a little thatched roof about their bases ; beneath one of these there seemed to be a slight opening ; I thrust in my finger and felt the nest , and touched the warm eggs . Never have I seen a more cozy , or cunningly constructed , sparrow 's nest . No rain could touch it , and no eye penetrate its secret . Last season my sparrow neighbors built in the heart of currant-bushes and rose-bushes , but this spring one of them at least has trusted her secret to the keeping of the grass , and , as it has turned out , has had no occasion to regret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and later in the season succeeded again farther down the bill . A week or two later in walking along a secluded , bushy lane leading to the woods , which has been a favorite walk of mine for more than forty years , I chanced upon another secret treasure open to the eye of heaven , which gave me a degree of pleasure greater than any other single incident which my forty years ' acquaintance with the old lane had brought me . I chanced to see upon the ground a deep , bulky , beautifully formed nest , encircled by the stalks of a tall-growing weed . It was a mass of dry leaves and grasses , with an unusually deep and smooth cavity lined with very fine vegetable fiber that looked like gold thread . Evidently a finished nest , I thought . but it was empty , and there were no birds about . It did not have the appearance of a nest that had been " harried , " as the Scotch boys say , but of one just that moment finished and waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place and was delighted to find that it was really a live nest . The sitting bird had slipped off ' on my approach so slyly that I had not seen her . The nest contained four small , delicate white eggs marked with fine black specks on their larger ends ; these were completely dominated by a large , vulgar-looking cow-bird 's egg . Presently two anxious birds , one of them strikingly marked with yellow , black , white , and blue-gray , appeared in the branches above my head , and began peering nervously down upon me and uttering a faint " sip , " " sip . " " Warblers , " I said ; and , as they flitted excitedly about me , I soon recognized the goldenwinged warbler ? a rare bird in my locality , and one whose nest I had never before seen . " What a pretty coincidence , " I said ? " the nest or the golden-winged warbler at the foot of a clump of golden-rod , and lined with gold thread ! " The old , neglected farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presently a male chestnutsided warbler , whose song I had been hearing near by ? " This , this , this is me , sir " came and joined the golden-wings , and appeared to share their solicitude , but , after he had inspected me from all sides , moved off in the higher trees and resumed his singing . " Your nest is not far off , " I said , " and maybe in some lucky moment I shall find that also . " What a touch these delicate and striking warblers gave to the old lane ! It was like a page from Audubon or Wilson . The golden-wings , much agitated , kept up their flitting about me till I withdrew . A week later I returned and found the eggs all hatched , probably a day or two previous ; and the big , pot-bellied cow-bird fairly engulfed the frail little warblers . Up came its head with its wide-open mouth quivering with eagerness . I saw at a glance what would soon be the fate of those delicate baby warblers ; they would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So I took the naked , ungainly interloper in my hand and resumed my walk through the bushy fields , hoping to find the nest ' of some larger bird with young , in which I might place it , and watch the result . I considered myself lucky when I found a song-sparrow 's nest with the young nearly half grown . How closely they pressed themselves down in the nest and made no sign ! When I put the little beggar of a cow-bird down in their midst , they remained as silent and motionless as ever . It proceeded to creep about over them , every moment or two thrusting up its mouth for food . Will the mother sparrow adopt this banding , I wonder , and feed it ? I had my doubts . The next day I returned and found it still crawling and sprawling about on the backs of its bed-fellows , and evidently very hungry . It thrust up its appealing mouth regularly twice each minute during the six minutes I watched it . Evidently it had had no share in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement , like a child with hiccough . I regret now that I did not feed it myself , and continue each day to do so , in order to have studied further the outcome . I returned the next morning and found the poor thing beneath the heap this time , and quite dead . As I proceeded to remove its limp and shrunken body , the young sparrows suddenly took alarm and , with their wing.quills only mere stubs , scrambled out of the nest and struggled off in the grass and weeds . I gathered them together and put them back in the nest , but they would not stay . Out they floundered again as soon as my hand was withdrawn . It is always so ; when young birds once leave the nest , the movement is final . It is the word of Fate ; they will not be put back . They defile the nest as they leave , and that act is a contemptuous farewell . Haste to leave the nest is characteristic of all birds . Their enemies are so many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they get out and scatter and hide , the better it is for them . My sparrows would doubtless have remained several days yet had not my blundering experiment hastened matters . I had set in action the force of a natural instinct before the conditions were quite ripe for it . Less than one hundred yards from the sparrow 's nest I had the good fortune to find the nest of a yellow-breasted chat , one of the shyest and most elusive of our birds . The cat-bird , the chewink , and the brown thrasher , all skulkers and hiders , do not approach the chat in this respect . It haunts low , bushy fields and tangled , swampy retreats whence , in May and June , issue the strange , interrupted , polyglot cat-calls of the male . But to see him or his mate , you have got to out-skulk him , and that is no easy task . He is a fine , strong-looking bird , with his deep olivegreen coat and yellow breast and black , curved bill , and black feet and legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weird calls have a tantalizing air of secrecy and elusiveness , as if to challenge your curiosity , changing from the quack of a duck to the mew of a cat or the caw of a crow or the hark of a fox or the rattle of the kingfisher . When you penetrate his retreat he suddenly ceases and begins manceuvering to see you without being seen . In the present case I knew a pair had a nest in the corner of the bushy lot that held the sparrow 's nest , because I had heard the male sending forth his polyglot challenge from that vicinity on several occasions , and twice had I ransacked that part of the field and the busy border of the adjoining field pretty thoroughly . On this day , which was a wet one , I renewed the search , beating through the low growths of sumac and witch-hazel and scrub-oak very carefully . As I reached the corner of the held where mycourse was barred by an old stone fence , I paused and was about turning back , saying to myself regretfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that nest , " when , turning around , I spied the nest in a hazel-hush not five feet from me . The sitting bird slipped off as my eye caught her nest , and silently disappeared in the bushes . In a moment more , and while I was inspecting her nest , she appeared fifteen feet away and uttered a sharp , harsh , feline mew . But her mate did not show himself , nor did he during any of my subsequent visits . 1 often heard him sending forth his unbirdlike calls from the hushes , but never once did I lay eyes upon him , though I tried hard to do so . The nest is quite a massive structure in the forks of a hazel-bush , about four feet from the ground ; it held four handsome speckled eggs . I should like to have put my young cow-bird in such a nest , could I have found it at the right moment , and watched the result . This nest prospered ; the young were out in due time , but not once did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was empty . Bird life is the fullest and most intense during the mating and nesting season . Love or war , courting or scrapping , rule their activities . What jealousies and rivalries , what warring and winning , go on all ; bout us ! The birds are all glad and mad at the same moment . One morning in April I heard the excited voices of bluebirds and robins in the vineyard below me ; going down there , I saw a pair of bluebirds and a pair of robins flitting about and perching on the wires and posts in an angry and excited frame of mind . Some of their movements and gestures suggested that they were scrapping . But why shotild bluebirds and robins scrapr I asked myself . I had never seen them do such a thing , so I began looking about for a common enemy , and expected to find a cat skulking in a ditch there , or maybe a snake . But I could find neither ; still the excited and accusing voices kept it up . Then I chanced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grape-post which was splintered and broken at the top . I found that the robins were building a nest there in a ragged depression on the top of the post , and that a foot and a half lower down the bluebirds had preempted a downy woodpecker 's old hole , and were making a nest there . The fracas was explained ; neither pair of birds wanted the other such near neighbors . Each looked upon the post as its own . 1 saw that the robins had made a bad choice ? no cover or screen of any kind . The first fish-crow that flew over in egging time would see the nest and rifle it promptly . I would I could have told the mother robin of the dangerous site of her nest . A week or ten days later I saw her brooding her eggs in apparent security , but not long afterward I found her gone and her nest empty and torn ; but as I put my hand in the post , out went the mother bluebird . The crows and jays could not reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as alone suited to her needs . Birds have their troubles as well as we featherless bipeds . In May the jays are out on their egging expeditions in the groves and orchards . I see two or three together sneaking ahont ? not graceful flyers , or very pleasing birds in summer , but in winter it is a pleasure to see them . Most other birds seem to know them as thieves and robbers . Yesterday one alighted on a post in the vineyard below me and sat quietly taking his bearings . Suddenly a robin came from ambush somewhere and made a vicious pass at him . The jay squatted to avoid the blow , and uttered his ugly " Scat ! " The robin took his stand near by and watched him . The jay flew to a near-by apple-tree , and the robin shot in after him very savagely . The jay soon flew down toward the river . I think that the robin does not quite hit the jay on such occasions , but her angry tone and threatening manner make the thief know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " loud enough , and the thief is very apt to take to his heels . Most of the birds are in a more or less explosive mood in the nesting season . They alternate between love and anger many times a day . Each bird in nesting time has its little domain , and isjealous of all trespasses . A male woodthrush quite early in May seemed to lay claim to an old apple-tree near the house where a brood of thrushes were reared last year . He made his headquarters in that tree , waiting , I fancied , for his mate to arrive , and behaving in a decidedly unfriendly way to every robin that invaded his precinct . For days I saw him scrapping with robins in and around that tree . The robins , innocent intruders , were taken by surprise . " What is that speckle-breasted dandy so red-hot about ? " their manners seemed to say . The thrush would charge the robins spitefully , and follow them into the garden with his threatening gestures and sharp , " Quit , quit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robin turned upon him , feeling apparently that in a trial of rude strength a poet like himself was no match for a plebeian mud-dauber like the robin . But he would return to the charge , and keep up his pretty , graceful protests whenever his tree was invaded . Finally his mate , or another female , came , and the two now have a nest there , and all seems well with them . But the male has a rent in his brown coat , and a feather is missing from his waistcoat , revealing the dark gray lining , and giving him just a suspicion of shabbiness . I am wondering if some indignant robin could not tell how he came by these blemishes . This particular male thrush , by the way , has the most robin-like note I have ever heard come from a wood-thrush . Often his " Fip , fip , fip , " is so like the robin 's that I have to look to see which bird it is . When the female had been here a few days I frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low branch of the apple-tree ; they were evidently considering it as a likely place for a nest . Then one morning I saw the female bring a piece of white paper and place it i in the fork and sit down upon it . She went through this performance several times without making any progress . Once I saw a sheet of note-paper dancing around on the gravel path in a most extraordinary manner , and presently caught a glimpse of the thrush beneath it , holding one edge of it in her beak , and trying hard to get such control of It is always interesting to me to see the young birds leave their nest . It is , as I have said , generally an irrevocable step ; they very rarely go back ? young swallows do , however , perhaps more frequently than other birds . The nest is in no sense a home , but a nursery for a brief period . Most of our birds who bring off a second brood build a second nest , though a robin will occasionally reline and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nest one by one , sometimes at intervals of an hour or two ; at others , of a day or more . A brood of three young bluebirds recently left the nest in a box on the corner of my porch between seven and ten o'clock . The day before , they began to appear in the opening , and to look out upon the bright summer landscape and chirp ; now and then a wing was thrust out and exercised for a moment ? probably no bird leaves its nest till it has flapped its wings a little . On the morning of the exodus , the young were more than usually restless and loud and persistent in their calls to their parents . The parents in turn called to them in a new way ? it was the plaintive , far-away call that the birds utter on their arrival in spring , and that they send forth when apparently starting on a long flight . The young answered back in the same tone ? " Pure , pure , " as if on the eve of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening fluttered out and clung to the outside of the box , where it remained clinging and calling for a minute or more . Then , with a sudden impulse , it let go its hold and flew straight to the branches of an apple-tree fifty or sixty feet away . It was a successful flight , and a successful alighting . One of the parent birds was on hand instantly , uttering an approving or an encouraging note , or maybe only a note of solicitude . In the course of two or three hours the two other birds left the nest in a similar manner , except that there was no preliminary clinging to the outside ? they flew straight from the opening to the old apple-tree , and the next day were drifting about the orchard with their parents . By fall or before , they will probably join the earlier brood which I think still lingers in this vicinity , and the united families in a loose flock will drift about this part of the country . In June I saw a brood of young woodthrushes leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one bird a little more forward than the others . In this case one of the young thrushes perched on the edge of the nest for a few minutes and chirruped . Then , in a blundering way , apparently more by accident than design , it reached the big branch upon which the nest was saddled . After a while it flew a few feet to another branch . The two others , after similar manceuvermg , joined it in the course of the day , but neither of them left the apple-tree on that day . At night there was a heavy thunder-shower with vio-lent wind , and in the morning two of the young thrushes were back in the nest . So , under exceptional circumstances , young birds do return to the nest . If i they had left the tree , it is quite certain they would not have taken refuge in the nest . But the fury of the elements made them turn to the old cradle ? and very human-like they were in so doing . During the day they left its protecting arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the outside of their nest and beat their wings vigorously a day or two before taking flight . The young of the grouse and quail and of the small water and shore birds run away from the nest the day they are hatched ; they trust to their legs long before their wing quills have sprouted . The young humming-birds that I have seen leave the nest shot up into the air as if a spring beneath them had been released . The current notion that the parent birds teach the young to fly ? that of set purpose they give them lessons in flying ? is entirely erroneous . The young fly automatically when the time comes , as truly so as the witch-hazel nut explodes , and the pod of the jewel-weed goes off when the seeds are ripe . The parent birds call to their young , and I have thought that in some cases they withhold the food longer than usual , to stimulate the young to make the great adventure . But in the case of the bluebirds referred to , the young were fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
