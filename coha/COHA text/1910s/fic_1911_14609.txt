A DOORWAY from the stairs without opens upon a simple little room . The lace-curtained windows on one side conceal a balcony from which , in the distance , the Via Bondinelli may be seen . Directly opposite these windows there is a fireplace above which rests an odd mirror with painted putti enfolding it . A door , hidden by a faded , beaded curtain , leading into the bedroom , is near this . A sofa-chair by the coal-Boulet fire ; some smaller chairs and a table complete the furnishings . The room has not taken on a personal note : it seems detached from whatever could happen in it  --  just a place . The sun is burning through the windows , and , as the play proceeds , it glows into a dull red , finally fading while the fire alone tints the room more and more gently . THE WOMAN is seated by the window , looking intently through the lace curtains . She is evidently awaiting somebody . She is about thirty , dark , with a suggestion of deep capabilities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual beauty . Upon her face rests a vague suspense . She is in deep mourning . There is a long pause : suddenly her face lights up ; she rises , watches anxiously a moment , then relaxes  --  disappointed . In her hand she holds a crumpled telegram , which she smooths out and rereads . The clock slowly strikes five , and she crosses to it , indicating her expected visitor is late . She stands before the fire a second , kisses the telegram , puts it in her dress  --  recrosses to the window again slowly . In a few seconds her sharp intake of breath shows some one is coming . She watches , fascinated , yet strangely puzzled . She goes up to the door and leaves it open . Then she controls herself , comes down to the fire , turns and waits . After another pause THE MAN enters . He sees her : she gives a start , stopped apparently by his changed appearance . He slowly closes the door behind him , and stands there . They are alone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin , eyes deep-set and yearning , with features once clear-cut , now blurred subtly . He is a man of halted potentials ; he suggests a locked tragedy . THE WOMAN You are late . p. 3 THE MAN ( After a pause ) Yes . THE WOMAN ( Slowly also ) You never were late . THE MAN Five years change . THE WOMAN Some of us . ( Looking at him ) It has you  --  greatly . THE MAN Yes , greatly . THE WOMAN I have come a long way across the seas to your city . THE MAN ( Simply ) I have never left it . THE WOMAN I knew you were waiting . ( His face shades a bit unnoticed . ) Do you understand why I am here  --  now ? THE MAN ( Calmly ) Your husband is dead ! THE WOMAN ( Surprised ) You knew ? THE MAN That could be the only reason . THE WOMAN It was a few months ago  --  at home . If he had been younger he might have  --  but he suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards . I managed to get this same apartment . It has n't changed so very much with the years , has it ? ( They look about . He seems to linger on the objects : finally his eye rests upon the sofa-chair : she follows his gaze. ) p. 4 THE MAN Even that . THE WOMAN ( Smiles fondly in recollection ) Yes : where you read to me so often those few months we were alone and happy . To me it seems like yesterday  --  THE MAN To you , yes . ( He half shrugs his shoulders and arouses himself from a settling mood . ) So you have sent for me at last . THE WOMAN ( Happily ) As soon as I arrived . THE MAN ( Sharply ) Why ? THE WOMAN ( With exhilaration ) Why ?  --  Because now I am free . THE MAN ( With measured effect ) But what has that to do with me ? THE WOMAN ( Simply ) I have come to marry you . ( They gaze at each other but do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen that marriage can keep apart those who love ? Perhaps I have grown afraid of its power . THE WOMAN So have I. ( She shudders . ) Yes ; it is terrible when love is dead . I must not think of those years : they were frightful . ( She comes closer . ) But , dear , it is different with us ; you and I who have known love , who do . p. 5 THE MAN It is too late with you and me  --  too late . THE WOMAN ( Scarcely realizing ) Too late ? ( Intuitively ) There is somebody else ? THE MAN No . That problem was saved me : one does n't suffer a second time willingly . THE WOMAN Then , then  --  oh , no : it ca n't be ; you  --  you no longer love me ? THE MAN Say rather I have learned really to know you during the absence , and that has made things different . THE WOMAN Different ? THE MAN You are not what I thought you : you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) After all that , I must pass ! ( Losing control ) Then why did you let me see you again ? Why did you come here in this room of ours ? Why did n't you write me ? Anything else . THE MAN ( With cold incisiveness ) Because I 'm not the coward to dodge a difficult situation . It concerns your life . You have a right to demand and receive an explanation . I ca n't let you be tortured , as I was , through inference and imagination . I want to be fair  --  if that is ever possible between men and women . p. 6 THE WOMAN It 's not a time to be proud : I love you too much . ( He is unmoved . ) To-day , I wanted only to feel : now you make me think . It 's hard when I expected  --  but , you see , I 'm  --  I 'm calm . ( She soon masters herself completely . ) You say you have learned to know me during the absence . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was our agreement with him . THE WOMAN Yet you must have felt the messages I sent you every hour : you never left me for a moment . You knew me as no man ever knew me . THE MAN You knew love for the first time : you revealed yourself  --  that 's all . THE WOMAN ( Leaning forward ) And you did love that woman who was ? THE MAN Yes ,  --  to the dregs . THE WOMAN ( Eagerly ) Then how , how have I changed ? Tell me one single fact to show I am different than you thought me ! THE MAN There is only one fact since you ask it : you stayed with him : you continued to wear his name and his ring but you loved another man . THE WOMAN So that was it . ( She puts her hands silently before her face. ) p. 7 THE MAN You seem to forget the darkness that was closing in upon your married life before I came : the staring of your two naked egos , the seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the reach toward me to save you . THE WOMAN ( Interrupting ) No , no , one never forgets . I knew my own lie , only he loved me in spite of all . What else could we have done , after we told him about ourselves ? THE MAN You forget , too , I gave you the strength to stay with him the time he demanded to test our love by separation  --  before he would let you go " easily . " THE WOMAN Yes . You said : " We must not build our happiness upon a broken life . " And my crime was in being true to the strength you had given me . THE MAN ( Cynically ) Not exactly . THE WOMAN What then ? THE MAN ( Hesitating ) Something happened to me . THE WOMAN It 's no time to hesitate . Go on . THE MAN When you left here I knew I was loved for the first time . I had entered into my man 's inheritance ; nothing before had counted : through you I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whirl me over the seas and mountains . I had told you love would summon my forces with the brush to their fullest expresion , for in myself I desired the mere consciousness that you loved me to drive me on to all that you had expected of me. p. 8 THE WOMAN ( Who eagerly followed his words ) Yes , yes ; you know I sought it , too .  --  Ah , how your words sweep me back ! Dear , do n't you know I could not have left you then , at all if I had not thought that ? THE MAN ( Cynically ) Could n't you ? I wonder . ( She is hurt by his doubt . ) But listen : I spiritualized everything to keep me strong in parting ; I think I half believed it , too , till you had actually gone . And then  --  THE WOMAN Then ? THE MAN Then I saw I could n't exist on the heights alone : the air was too rare , and I had to come down into the valleys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . It was n't only spirit : there was something more insistent than the hope of what might be in time : it was the sharp cry of the moment . ( He pauses . ) I loved you too  --  humanly . THE WOMAN ( Unabashed ) I know . I know . ( Long pause . ) Go on . THE MAN And with the months there was that cry for you , for the sound of your voice , the touch of your fingers on my arm , the perfume which meant you  --  p. 9 THE WOMAN ( Moved ) I met you everywhere . THE MAN I tried to forget by thinking of your belief in my work . But , what were my pictures when my hand shook with the beat of my blood ? Then , I ceased to see you as a force : it was only the woman who haunted me ( Bitterly ) and always  --  always like a sharp dagger thrust I would realize she was with another man ! THE WOMAN ( Quickly ) Whom I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAN But you were with him ! That was the grinding edge . He could see you , touch you , be kind to you . THE WOMAN He saw only surfaces : all the rest had ceased before you came . THE MAN ( Big ) But you were with him ! THE WOMAN ( Feebly ) Could n't you remember I loved you ? THE MAN I tried . If it had been only spirit I could have tucked it away tenderly in lavender and lace , and kept it apart from the humanity in and about me . But it was n't : it was love I was not ashamed of  --  as it should be between man and woman  --  with the spirit there , high and strong , yet rooted below in the facts of life ! p. 10 THE WOMAN How I understand ! How you must have suffered ! ( Almost inaudibly ) It was the same with me . THE MAN ( Emphatically ) But , in spite of everything , I was faithful to what you wished , until  --  THE WOMAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away all my defenses : it was that which cheapened you in my eyes . THE WOMAN ( Cut ) Cheapened ? Oh  --  not that . THE MAN ( Slowly ) Yes ; and when you became less , love somehow seemed too exacting and ( Very bitterly ) there was nothing to keep me stronger than the men about me . THE WOMAN ( Understanding ) I have tried never to think of those others who might  --  ( Turning aside and almost whispering ) But I knew you were a man . Oh , do n't bring their shadows here . THE MAN ( Hesitating ) I am making you suffer too much . I ca n't soften the facts . Shall I go on ? p. 11 THE WOMAN Yes : I am used to suffering . It is best you finish . ( She wipes her eyes . ) What  --  what was it I did to cheapen love ? THE MAN As I said : you stayed with him . THE WOMAN ( Almost fiercely ) Do you think that was easy ? THE MAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ! ( She is stunned , quivers , and turns away silent . She almost staggers to a chair , and sits down with head bowed : he tries to control his bitterness , but it escapes more and more in spite of him . ) I waited for him to let you go willingly , to give you your promised chance for happiness . But as the alloted time passed by and nothing happened , my imagination pictured the possibilities of the situation . I knew how you could deceive , not always to protect yourself but to save others . Were you saving him  --  making it entirely tolerable ? Were you concealing your deeper life completely , and tricking him with an affected happiness ? Why did you go on as in the past ? Was he holding you by Pity ? If for his love he would n't do anything , why did n't you for yours ? THE WOMAN ( Confused ) Me ? But  --  but , I could n't hurt him ! p. 12 THE MAN I knew your capacity for suffering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love had grown to mean to you  --  an excuse for suffering ? Were you , too , luxuriating , like so many other women , in your self-inflicted martyrdom and sacrifice , forgetting that I  --  the man you loved  --  was with you on the altar ? Were you sheltering your inactivity beneath spiritual sophistries  --  jagged , rusty , death-bearing ideals of duty , pity , and the like  --  THE WOMAN ( Trying to interrupt him throughout ) Stop  --  stop  --  ! THE MAN  --  or were you willingly shirking the responsibilities and the obligations to the love you had inspired ?  --  Do n't you see how the uncertainty almost drove me mad ? THE WOMAN ( Primitively ) Then why did n't you come take me ?  --  Why ? Why ? THE MAN Because it was your place to find the impulse from within yourself . ( She is confused . ) When you did n't , I saw you were a moral coward , a weak , conventional woman who had n't the courage to reach out and take her happiness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a man you did not love . That 's what destroyed everything in me  --  for I despised you . p. 13 THE WOMAN ( Crushed ) But , did n't you understand ? Could n't you some-how ? Oh  --  ! THE MAN ( With slow contempt ) Yes , I understood : it was the line of least resistance . THE WOMAN ( Desperately defending herself ) No ! No ! THE MAN ( Pressing the point ) It was so much easier to be conventional . THE WOMAN I knew you were waiting for me . I knew  --  THE MAN But you forgot how tired one 's arms could be , holding them out endlessly . ( Slowly ) You preferred to accept the conventional protection of his name , because you feared the parched places you must cross to come to me ; you dreaded the peering eyes , the smirch of lips , the shrug of shoulders . So you mechanically kept by his side , starving him , starving yourself , and starving me . But now  --  now that his protection is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no effort ; you need my protection . Death offers the gift , not you . But you are conventional to the end ; for you even come to the man you love wearing the mourning weeds of him who stood between !  --  ( She grasps quickly at her dress , then with a deep moan sinks upon the sofa-chair amid stifled sobs . A very long pause follows . He stands looking at her , betraying only bitterness. ) p. 14 THE WOMAN ( Completely broken ) Oh  --  what a miserable failure I am . How you make me see it . You 've torn off everything . God !  --  and  --  and it 's all true  --  true ! I was a coward . I am . THE MAN ( Nearer ) There may have been things I did not know . THE WOMAN ( As though honest with herself for the first time ) They would n't alter . No : it 's all true and more . never could be strong alone . With you I felt capable of anything , but away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face what would have to be gone through . I could n't take that first step . The newspapers , the gossip  --  everything . I did n't dare move from his protection  --  for he did protect me  --  not ( With self-disgust ) not because he loved me  --  oh  --  that 's the worst of it . That all ceased in him . THE MAN When he thought I had passed ! How like us men ! THE WOMAN Yes . He was conventional , too . He merely dreaded the talk  --  that  --  and nothing else . I knew it and despised him . But he was kind in his way . That 's what we bartered these years : that was our marriage . I could not shake myself free from the wall that held me . Somebody has always taken care of me . That 's why I married him when I was left alone as a girl . That 's why I come to you . Do n't stop me . It 's all true . I did fear the parched places and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  could I ever come . ( She shudders and struggles with her sobs. ) p. 15 THE MAN ( After eying her : a little more softly ) Forgive me . If I had been stronger I would have spared you this  --  lied to you somehow , and made it easier . It seems like dynamiting a butterfly . But I 've been thinking these phrases and they just came out . Love failed me and I failed love . I 'm not strong any more . I was afraid in the old days you expected too much from me . Good-by . ( He starts to go : she rises , halting him , at the strange tenderness in his voice . ) THE WOMAN Yes . I did expect too much from you . I was weak : I could suffer , yet could not do for love . But those years have gone : I can offer no defense save that through them all I did not know I was harming you . I thought you were strong and would go grandly on to your destiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is harder for me than all you have said : not only do I fall beneath your ideal of me but the love I inspired in you failed to keep you " big . " THE MAN ( Humbly ) Yes . THE WOMAN ( She comes closer to him ) You have blamed me with the selfishness that only lies in pent-up bitterness , and you have forgotten what you have done to me . Look at me . Straight in the eyes . ( He reluctantly does so ; she continues reproachfully ) What have you done with all those dreams you said my coming had brought you ? What have you done with all the ambitions which I aroused ? Where are the pictures with the soul of the woman you loved in them ? Oh ! What have you done with your own love for me ? p. 16 THE MAN Nothing , nothing . That 's the other reason why it 's too late . You 're worthy of pity : I am not even worthy of that . Now we both understand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though a great dream lay broken between us  --  THE MAN Yes , I feel it , too . Neither of us did anything ! THE WOMAN ( Slowly ) Two failures ! Where love had so much to offer . Two failures ! THE MAN There are three . Your husband failed also . In his strength while he loved you , he might have made us both ashamed . THE WOMAN And ever afterward have stood between . ( The light outside is gone . Only the fire leaps and colors them . There is another long pause . ) How dark it has become . THE MAN I must be going out into the blackness again . THE WOMAN Yes . I also , later . THE MAN ( Lingers ) Too bad  --  too bad . When love might have done so much . How we have abused it  --  we three . I suppose we learn to find our true value in loving . Oh ! The shame in finding so much alloy . Love is only for the strong ; it breaks the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're wrong . Does love lie only in strength ? ( She comes to him . ) Does n't love ever come to the tired and weak ? Ca n't one be just a plain , helpless woman craving protection of the man , who , in turn , needs a bosom for his tired head ? Dear One , I have no pride left . I am that weak and lonely woman : you are that tired man . We have nobody else . Because you failed me , my love is no less . ( With penetration ) Are you so sure your love for me is dead ? THE MAN I am dead inside . THE WOMAN ( Quickly ) Are you ? Are you ? I 'm not . I 'm proud of the life that lies calling beneath the self-pity , beneath the woman 's weakness and failure . ( Coming very close and holding his hands . ) Do n't you know all these years , I , too , have held the dream of you close  --  close to me  --  and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Bitterly ) Then there was something  --  with him ? ( She protests as he turns away . ) Of course not . There are some things a woman would always lie about to another man ! THE WOMAN ( Catching the jealous note in his voice , she eagerly puts her hand on his shoulder ; turning him to her . He tries to speak but is swept to passion by the touch . ) Dearest , you still love me. p. 18 THE MAN ( Half struggling away ) No . I tell you  --  it 's over  --  dead  --  tossed in the rubbish heap . THE WOMAN ( Vibrantly ) This has always been between us : this has been alive all these years , and I 'm not ashamed either . THE MAN No ! No ! THE WOMAN We ca n't escape : we 've been blind to-day . Listen , I love you , I love you , and you love me . THE MAN ( Trying to free himself ) It 's dead . No ; no . THE WOMAN You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your cruelty , the bitterness , and the hurt in your heart cries it . If I were meant to pass , you would not have come . Kiss me : you are afraid to kiss me  --  ( He stands , looking at her , caught by his own feelings . They are still a moment ; then his head lowers . They kiss . She falls back , half swooning , in his arms . ) THE MAN Dearest . Dearest . ( With tenderness ) Dearest !  --  ( He takes her to the sofa-chair , and puts her upon it . He holds her hands , and sits on the rug beside her . She opens her eyes. ) p. 19 THE WOMAN ( Faintly ) Ah ! The tenderness of you , too . You will protect me  --  watch over me . I know . THE MAN Yes , yes  --  for always now . I love you .  --  It 's stronger . ( He lowers his head ; she feels his tears and kisses on her hands . She leans over him. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
