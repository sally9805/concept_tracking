Government detectives are investigating a report that he had something to do with the alleged poisoning of a number of horses shipped from this country to Italy last December . afeler was one of the crew of the steamship Evelyn , which sailed from Brooklyn on Dec. 26 last . The vessel , bound for Genoa . and in charge of Captain W. A. Barlow , besides a general cargo carried 336 horses which had been purchased here for the Italian Government , then preparing for war with Austria . The Government detectives who have been investigating the case told this story of what followed : " Soon after clearing Sandy Hook the Evelyn ran into a gale which continued for five days . The horses became sick and most of them died . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlo Rocco , who was in charge of them , suspected that the animals had been poisoned , possibly by a secret agent of some foreign Government . " As during the storm the condenser of the Evelyn had become disabled and the vessel had sprung a leak , Captain Barlow changed his " course to St. George , Bermuda .

Fari Forni , and Luigi Corbella , the purchaser of the horses . Rocco is said to have declared there was only one day of bad weather during the trip to Bermuda . and that the horses got sick from lack of water . Then , he said , the Captain ordered the hostlers to drive the animals overboard , saying that as the pipes of the condenser had burst they could n't get any more water for the horses , and they would all be dead in a day or two , anyway .
