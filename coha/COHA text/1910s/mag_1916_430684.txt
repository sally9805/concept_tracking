THE time was early spring and the place the table-linen counter in one of the leading linen houses of the country . While waiting for my change I overheard a clerk say to his customers , a mother and daughter : " Pardon me , but did you say the wedding is to be next October ? Then I 'd advise you to buy all your linen just as soon as possible . Linens are going up in price every day in the wholesale market , and by the middle of the summer they will be from thirty to fifty percent higher than they are now . And there wo n't he such a variety to choose from . We have been instructed to tell all our customers who are buying wedding linens that the earlier they act everything they need the better value they will get for their money " I lingered a moment to see whether these customers would heed the voice of the oracle . They evidently decided to do so , for they began adding to the purchases they had already made . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department , a man who is an expert in technical knowledge and an authority on the conditions of the trade . I felt sure there were some interesting facts behind the salesman 's remarks . " Yes , " said this linen-buyer , " it 's true . Linen ? and by that I mean all-linen , not a mixture of cotton and linen ? is so scarce , and there is so little prospect for more , that the manufacturer 's price goes up every day , I could almost say every hour . We are practically facing a linen famine . There has never been anything like it since I 've been in the trade , and that is nearly forty years . " I was told that the cause of this critical condition is the war . Linen factories in Ireland , France , and Scotland can not get the raw material to manufacture because the flax fields of Russia and Belgium have  |p651  been devastated . Russia produces eighty - one percent of the flax used for fabrics , and Belgium , in the Courtrai district , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acres that ought to be under cultivation today are lying waste and ruined . Of course Ireland grows some flax , but compared with the world 's need it is really only a handful . So there is no doubt that the linen merchants are considerably worried to know how , if the war keeps on , they will be able to get any pure-linen fabrics . At this point there comes up in our minds the question as to why we do not grow our own flax . We do grow nearly four million acres of it in this country , but it is grown for seed , not fiber . Over sixty million dollars ' worth of linseed-oil is made from flaxseed every year in America , and about ten million dollars ' worth of oil-cake . When the flax is threshed for seed , the fibers are ruined for use in the manufacture of fine linen . Furthermore , flax that is grown for making linen must be of a finer variety and must be cultivated with greater care than flax that is grown for seed . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , very evenly and thickly , so that the plants will grow tall and straight , instead of branching out . This , of course , gives a longer stalk and consequently a longer fiber . When the flax comes up , it seems to develop a strong affinity for weeds ? or weeds for it ? and these must be pulled up by hand when the flax is from four to six inches tall . Where flax is grown for fiber , hundreds and hundreds of women and children are employed to do this work . Of course they are paid the merest pittance . When the crop is ready for harvesting , it must also be gathered by hand , because if the stalk of the flax-plant is cut , the loss of the sap makes the fiber less valuable for linen manufacture . It seems strange , but it is true , that no satisfactory machine has ever been invented for pulling up the flax by the roots without crushing the stalk . When we know all this , we no longer wonder why flax is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why our linen handkerchiefs have not been priced at two dollars and a half instead of only twenty-five cents . In addition to the labor involved in growing flax for fiber , there are about thirty other processes which the flax has to go through before it is ready to be sold as linen . Some of these have to be per/ formed by hand , as , for example , the " rippling , " which is a kind of combing to remove the leaves and seeds from the dried flax . After that comes the " retting , " a very disagreeable process , but one that is of great importance in its effect upon the quality of linen yarn produced from that particular crop . Retting consists in putrefying the bundles of flax by laying them in shallow pools of soft water for two weeks or so , until the woody stem has rotted away from the inner part , which is the fiber . If the flax is allowed to stay in the water too long , the yarn made from the fiber will be weaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stay long enough , there will be trouble in separating the coarse outside covering from the beautiful soft fiber . Niter this process there comes the " hackling , " " scutching , " " spreading , " and finally the spinning of the flax . The journey of the linen plant from the field to the shop counter is a long one it takes from sixteen to thirty weeks and if any process is hurried , the quality of the linen goods is impaired . Having been convinced that Europe can row flax and make the yarn more cheaply than we can in America , we yet ask : " Why do n't we import the yarn and weave table damask , towels , and handkerchiefs ourselves ? It is said that not a yard of table damask is woven in this country : Why have we not developed this industry as we have the weaving of cotton goods ? " The answer to this question is twofold . First , it takes from four to six times as many workers to produce a given quantity of linen as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the price of linen would be prohibitive if the linen were woven by American labor . The second reason why the weaving of fine linen is impossible in America is because the atmosphere is too dry . Linen yarn is brittle and demands moisture while it is being both spun and woven . Even in Ireland and Scotland , where the air is much more moist than it is here , the yarn is usually passed through troughs of warm water during the weaving , and humidifiers are often used in the factories . In many a European factory the floors are dripping wet all the time , and one wonders why the laborers do not die an early death . However , the hand-spinners of Belgium endure harder working conditions than this ; they are the people who spin the finest linen thread in the world , and they work in dark , damp cellars , where they can only feel the thread , not see it . Their sense of touch is marvelous ; they can spin a linen thread finer than any that can be made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be ninety thousand yards of it to the pound , and yet it is stronger than a cotton thread many times thicker . There is one more reason why this country can not produce fine linens . Even if they could be woven here , our atmosphere is too  |p653  dry to bleach them properly . The grassbleaching , by which the finest linens in Ireland get their dazzling whiteness. could not possibly be carried on in this country . We have too many long spells of dry , scorchingly hot weather . In Ireland , week in and week out , the sunshine and showers come and go like one long April day . and this succession of heat and moisture is ideal for grass-bleaching , or meadow -- bleaching , as it is sometimes called . Once upon a time , all linen manufactured in Ireland was , bleached in this way , just as the linen spun and woven by our great-grandmothers was bleached , but the great quantities demanded by the world today make this impossible . The manufacturer now relies chiefly upon chlorid of lime to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass-bleaches only a small part of his output . Parliament has passed a law requiring all grass-bleached and all handwoven linen to be so stamped that the customer can be sure of what she is buying . Now , since we can not produce our own linens , and Europe is at war , what shall we do to offset the shortage ? One and all , the manufacturers say , " Substitute cotton articles for linen articles , not only in mixtures of cotton and linen , which we call union goods , but in the pure cotton . " We promptly revolt against their advice , for there is a feeling that a sacred precinct would indeed be invaded if cotton took the place of the glossy damask so dear to every housewife 's heart , yet we are told that table damask , and napkins , hemstitched and bordered towels , and toweling by the yard for the guest towels that are so often embroidered by hand , are being made of pure cotton . These imitations are amazing . The tablecloths are woven thread for thread like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cotton damask will muss very easily , and get a roughened-up look , and it will get out of shape much more than linen damask ever does . As for the towels , even when one is held up to the light to bring out the sheen on every little nodule of the huckaback weave , it sometimes is almost impossible to believe from looking at a good imitation linen towel that it is not of heavy linen . In fact , it is heavy in the hand . But touching the face with it proves instantly that it is not linen . Instead of being smooth , cool , and comforting to the skin , it is rough , thick , and lifeless . The union toweling , which dealers and manufacturers prophesy will be widely used ( luring the scarcity of flax , is made by throwing a weft thread of cotton across a warp of coarse linen . The buyer for one of the large retail houses in New York told me  |p654  that union towels , a year from now , would be at least five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one could get excellent all-linen towels for that price . This buyer advised the use of Turkish towels instead of this union mixture . But nevertheless he had just placed an order for eight hundred dozen of the union towels . The place of linen in history does not seem strange when we reflect upon the individual qualities it possesses . It is because of these that linen has become a necessary luxury in our lives . The appeal which a pure-linen fabric makes to a person of refined tastes is quite unlike that made by any other textile . Its wholesome odor , smoothness , and feeling of " life , " or resilience , give it an irresistible charm . The beauty of fine table damask is not even equaled by silk . It is all the more wonderful when we realize that color plays no part in the attractiveness of the designs ; they are simply white upon white , and are visible only because the threads have been so cleverly woven that they reflect the light at different angles . The beautiful sheen in table-linen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inherent quality of the fabric ; it is produced , in the best grades of linen , not by dressings , but by a sort of pounding of the cloth , called " beetling . " Table-linen should be ironed when very damp in order to bring out all its gloss . Another peculiar quality of linen is its cleanliness . It is the cleanest of all the fabrics . Tests have proved that three times as much dirt will cling to cotton as will cling to linen , and that germs increase more rapidly on all other textiles than they do on linen . This property of cleanliness makes it invaluable for use in sickness , especially in surgical cases . Linen also launders more easily than cotton , and if properly washed and ironed it will keep white longer than cotton . This is why the outside layer of men 's collars is usually linen ; another reason is that linen does not stretch easily . The fact that it absorbs water quickly , and that water evaporates from it even more quickly , makes this fabric ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfactory than those of cotton , or cotton and linen . Unless they are of linen , they have no " bite , " and slide over the wet dish again and again without drying it . For underclothing , linen is the coolest of all fabrics ; its peculiar property of rapid evaporation makes it take up perspiration very quickly , and when wet it seems cold to the skin ; the danger of taking cold from this may be counteracted by using an open-meshed linen . Because of the temptation to offer adulterated goods at pure-goods prices , the problem of buying linens wisely will be more difficult than ever during the next two or three years , and since the muchneeded " honest labeling " law is still a future hope , the linen shopper should educate herself in the fascinating subject of choosing linens . She should know that an all-linen table damask will feel " harder " than one in which there is a considerable mixture of cotton ; the creases will be sharper , and the surface will not look so fuzzy when the fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold and rather heavy ; if it weighs less than four and a half ounces to the square yard , it is of a poor quality . The fabric must not be stiff and crackly ; if it is , there has been a great deal of sizing used in the finishing . Sizing  |p655  is often used to cover up injuries which the linen has received by the use of too much chlorid of lime in the bleaching . When this sizing is washed out , the result is a sleazy material that will not keep its shape . The wearing quality of linen sometimes depends upon the design , because the design is made by the weave . It must be remembered , also , that medium-priced table-cloths with the broad striped centers do not , as a rule , wear as well as those with a smaller all-over design , because of the long surface threads . Moreover , it is difficult to iron the former perfectly straight . Unbleached linen will wear much longer than bleached , and costs less ; it gradually , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in made-up sizes , with a border all around , are a little more expensive than the same width of damask bought by the yard . A cloth bought by the yard will not , of course , have the border across the ends , but the effect is good enough for ordinary use . Moreover , in buying linen by the yard , it is possible to be sure it is pure by buying first a small strip for chemical testing . A test that can be performed easily is the raveling of a few threads of both the warp and the weft . If , when the threads are broken , the ends fuzz up , it denotes the presence of cotton ; linen threads break with pointed ends and cling more closely together . An old-fashioned test is to place a moistened finger-tip under the cloth and observe how quickly the spot absorbs the dampness ; with pure linen it is almost instantly absorbed . Experts say that acid tests are the best ; some of these are a little difficult for home experimentation , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform this test a small piece of the linen is boiled to remove the dressing , and then the linen is placed in the concen- trated acid for sixty seconds . At the end of that time the linen threads will be weak . but the cotton will have passed away entirely . Caustic potash is also used to show the presence of cotton ; if a fringed piece of the union material is heated in a strong solution for two minutes , the lines : will be burned brown by the acid , but tilt cotton will be a pale-yellowish color . In buying linens for children 's clothes it is wise economy to get upholsterer 's fabrics . they are stronger than most dress linenand can sometimes be found in doubt , width and in a variety of artistic shades . In general , the only way for the woman who wants linens of a trustworth. character to be sure she is getting then : is to realize that she must pay a fait price for them . and to purchase them from a shop of excellent reputation If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should yield t , no temptation to buy , showy bargains from dubious sources . Reputable firms buy : their linens only from first - class manufacturers who guarantee their goods , and with this assurance behind him the retailer guarantees what he sellto the customer . Linen is the hardest thing to buy , the . hardest to sell , the most difficult to judge . and the easiest to injure . This last statement is true both regard to its manufacturing and its laundering . It may well be , therefore , that one result of the increase in the price of linen will be that all housewives will be more careful of what they have . The extra care and trouble taken to have linen laundered in the house will be repaid , not only by its better appearance , but by its longer life . Laundries wear out more linen than the years do . This , then , is the other side of the linen problem ? the conservation of present supplies , which means more knowledge of the fabric , and more respect for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
