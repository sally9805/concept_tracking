txt The steel industry of the United ' States would be very little disturbed if Chairman UNDERWOOD 'S bill reducing ' the duties of the iron and steel schedisle should go into effect to-morrow . Politically , this Democratic measure of tariff reduction may be in a very , high degree disturbing . From the political point of view it is not necessary primarily to inquire how much Mr. UNDERWOOD proposes to reduce the duties . We have Mr. CAR ? zczois 's word for it that no duties at all are needed for the protection of the steel industry . In his testimony before the Stanley Committee the other day he said that iron ore should come in free of duty ; that for a long time the tariff has not been a factor in the steel trade ; and that " we can make steel as cheaply as any country in the world ; in my opinion , steel does not need the protection of high tariff duties . " This testimony from the great builder of the steel industry , from the ironmaster who knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public hearings on the Underwood bill quite superfluous . When Mr. CARNEGIE says that we can make steel as cheaply as it can be made anywhere in the world , and that the business does not need the protection of high tariff duties , we are quite confident that the country will accept his opinion as authoritative and conclusive . How , then , can a Republican Senate reject a bill that reduces these wholly superfluous duties by only a little more than one-third on the average ? How can a Republican President decline to sign such a bill if passed by both houses ? The Presidential election is near at hand , the-preliminary campaign is in full progress , and the country has pretty clearly manifested its nish that tariff duties be reduced . Obviously , there would be political peril in resisting the reduction of duties which a man of Mr. CARNEGIE 'S great experience and authority has declared to be unnecessary to the prosperity of the steel business . Yet what a breach in that timestained tariff wall Mr. UNDERWOOD 'S bill would make ! The Republican Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that party and the protected interests demanded that in consideration of heavy campaign contributions duties on imports should be maintained , and , if changed at all , should be made higher . Pittsburgh has been a most generous contributor to the funds . Shall old acquaintance be forgot ? Pittsburgh , we imagine , cares much less about the matter than some of the other protected industries  --  for instance , that whose interests Senator LIPPITT has much at heart . If the Republicans of the Senate consent to a lowering of the iron and steel duties , how shall they resist the demand that the tariff taxes of the woolen and cotton goods schedules be reduced ? It is , a troublesome dilemma , either way out will be most disagreeable . That the Underwood bill is not of serious importance so far as the steel industry and the business of the country ' is concerned clearly appears not only from Mr. ** testimony , but from Mr. UNDERWOOD 'S statement on the floor of the House . He estimated that the average tariff on steel imports would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22.42 per cent . ad valorem ; that the revenues from steel imports would be reduced by the insignificant sum of $323,597 from the figures of 1911 , and by only $4,000,000 from the figures of 1910 . Imports of steel products he estimated would be increased to the extent of $20,000,000 . Chairman UNDEnwoon 's estimate supports the qpInion of Mr. CARNEGIE . It is evident tjiat a reduction of the steel and iron duties by one-third will have no serious economic effect . It is in its political and what we may call its sentimental aspects that the measure is important . It will be troublesome to the Republican Senate , and it does promise a revision of what has been one of the most *pregnable schedules . In connection with Chairman UNDERWOOD 'S bill and his report , the report of the Commissioner of Corporations on the cost of production in the steel in- , industry , which is published this morning , is of interest . Commissioner SMITH finds that the " book cost " of heavy Bessemer steel rails is $21.27 per ton . Di the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corporation , there are , however , ' profits between intermediate companies , what are called " transfer " costs , which are to be deducted . These transfer profits the Commissioner finds to be $2.47 a ton , leaving the actual cost of heavy steel rails $18.80 a ton . The price of steel rails for some ten years has been some $28 a ton , leaving a margin of $9.20 between cost and selling price . The report shows that behind every ton of steel rails there are mining and manufacturing investments varying front $80 to $55 a ton . " On this investment , " says the report , " the margin of $9.20 represents a profit of from 11 to 17 per cent . " A profit of 11 per cent . in the manufacturing business would not be considered excessive . The report dwells upon the " significant fact " of the difference between production costs of large companies , well integrated , and those of smaller concerns . Bessemer billets , for instance , for a group of large companies snow a book cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $2.65 . Deducting the " transfer profits , " the cost for large companies was $17.56 , and for small companies $21.69 , a difference of $4.13 . In part this difference in favor of the large companies reflects the larger investment and superior efficiency due to integration , but in part , also , the control of ore in the case of the Steel Corporation . The report treats at considerable length the transportation profits of the Steel Corporation , and the advantage accruing to it through its large control over ore production . These advantages , as the public already knows , have been surrendered in large part by the voluntary action of the United States Steel Corporation in canceling its ore-bed leases and in reducing rates on the railroads it owns .
