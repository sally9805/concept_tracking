The scene opens in the Herford Studio in New York . A very wide studio window at the left . A wide fireplace set obliquely in the upper right corner with seats built in at either side . A door leads into the hall at the right . A large cupboard is built in at the left toward the back . Before the window is a large revolving table with a frame built up from it , holding a section of a frieze in plaster about five feet square  --  showing figures of horses and men , running . At the right toward the rear there is a small revolving table . In the center of the stage stands a long narrow table with chairs at either side . The table is covered with drawing materials and sketches . The double doors at the back are open and show the workroom beyond , crowded with work in process . The light is that of five o'clock on an afternoon in March . The street backing of the private houses opposite shows that the room is on the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McKENZIE , a slender fellow of about 33  --  wearing a long white much-soiled linen coat over his clothes , with sleeves rolled above his elbows and a small cap covered with plaster on his head  --  is bending over the table at the left , drawing on a large pad . A workman , dressed as McKENZIE is dressed  --  is seen busily moving pieces of statuary about in the workroom . He closes the doors into the studio and McKENZIE , singing , goes up to get tools from the cupboard . CREEL comes into the open hall door and watches KEITH for a moment . She is a slender blonde woman about 30  --  pretty  --  delicate and extremely feminine . She wears a simple tailor suit and small becoming hat . KEITH 'S song grows louder and more elaborate and RUTH , smiling , tiptoes over to the left and stands back of him . p. 3 CREEL ( Shouting . ) Keith ! MCKENZIE ( Turning quickly . ) Ruth ! ( He kisses her warmly on the lips . ) CREEL ( After a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workroom . That is  --  the governor and Mrs. Herford are there working . CREEL I came to stay to dinner if they want me . MCKENZIE Mrs. Herford expects you . Better not let her know you 're here yet , though . She 's trying to finish a little figure this afternoon . Said not to let anything disturb her . CREEL Ca n't I even peek ? ( Opening the door a crack and looking in . ) There she is  --  hard at it , her sleeves rolled up and her hair coming down . My , how she loves it ! MCKENZIE Pay a little attention to me  --  will you ? ( Bringing her down and kissing her again . ) Did you just come from the office ? CREEL Yes ! Came right up here . MCKENZIE I 'm glad . You ' re tired , are n't you ? CREEL A little . p. 4 MCKENZIE I ca n't stand it to see you like this . Six months more and you 'll end it for good . CREEL It 's getting easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will never be so easy as staying in your own home , your own mistress  --  to go and come as you please . Will it ? CREEL ( Turning away with a sigh . ) Oh , there 'd be plenty of hard things about that , too . MCKENZIE Well  --  not altogether a path of roses at first perhaps  --  but the more I get on  --  CREEL That 's why we ought to wait till we can afford to marry , Keith dear . Just why I must keep on with my work . MCKENZIE Now do n't begin that again , Ruth . It 's all settled long ago . You 're going to stop all work on the magazine forever  --  and marry me in the fall . See ? ( Going to her again . ) Why do n't you go downstairs and have a little rest before dinner ? CREEL Oh , I do n't want to . I 'm going to wander around and have a good look at the whole place . Ann knew what she was about when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't she ? MCKENZIE Yes  --  Mrs. Herford 's a clever woman  --  but  --  ( Lowering his voice . ) Just the same this house was rather an extravagant plunge  --  and I wish they were back in the old little place . p. 5 CREEL Oh  --  nonsense ! Why ? MCKENZIE Because I 'm afraid the Governor is beginning to want to make money now  --  and it will hurt his work in the long run . CREEL Why should n't he want to make money ? You dear old impractical thing ! If you had a little more of the money part in your blood you 'd be  --  MCKENZIE Now do n't talk like that to  --  CREEL You 've given the best years of your life to this and there 's no future in it for you . Only the rare  --  the great ability gets anywhere in art . MCKENZIE But I believe in living for the thing a man loves . CREEL That 's all very well if you have money enough to live on  --  then you can let your ideals out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid  --  thank you . MCKENZIE Ruth , I wish I could make you see it as I do . CREEL And I wish I could make you see it as I do . So let 's not fight about it . MCKENZIE Do you love me ? CREEL Of course . I wonder when Ann will come out ? MCKENZIE Sometimes I 'm jealous of Mrs. Herford . You love her more than you do me. p. 6 CREEL Do n't be silly . A woman 's closer  --  in a different way . She understands . MCKENZIE Do n't I understand ? CREEL Oh  --  as well as a man ever does  --  I suppose . MCKENZIE What do n't I understand , dear ? Tell me . Try to make me . CREEL I 've been trying all these five  --  six years , that we 've been engaged . MCKENZIE Am I so hopelessly stupid ? CREEL No , it is n't you  --  it 's just because  --  you 're a man . It ca n't be helped . MCKENZIE Well now , try me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand . Try me . ( He holds her and she strokes his hair  --  looking into his face . ) CREEL You do n't understand that I like to be little and weak  --  and loved and spoiled and still want to fight with the world and wring my living out of it because I have ability to do a certain thing well . MCKENZIE ( Beginning to writhe . ) But you  --  you  --  that 's all wrong and unnatural . CREEL ( Laughing and drawing away . ) You see . It 's hopeless . Is n't it ? p. 7 MCKENZIE But that is n't fair . You take an extreme thing like that  --  CREEL It is n't extreme . It 's perfectly  --  MCKENZIE No man could understand that in any woman . HERFORD ( Coming in from the workroom . ) What 's the row ? Hello , Ruth . ( Going down with his hand out to RUTH and putting his other over hers as she gives it to him . ) ( TOM HERFORD is forty  --  a tall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virile , wholesome way . His shoes , trousers and soft shirt are all white and somewhat soiled from his work . ) CREEL Hello , Tom  --  you sweet man ! I always lose my heart to you when I see you in your working clothes . HERFORD ( Throwing an arm about her shoulder . ) You have my heart in any kind of clothes . Did you come to stay for dinner ? CREEL If you want me . Do n't tell Ann I 'm here . I 'm going downstairs . Keith 's cross with me . He has n't been nice a bit this afternoon . You 're always much kinder to me than he is . MCKENZIE You never spring any of your revolutionary speeches on Herford . You save all your really soothing remarks for me. p. 8 CREEL Tom , am I revolutionary ? Are n't I just a little cooing dove ? HERFORD Absolutely . MCKENZIE Yes  --  when you have your own way  --  there 's nothing on earth sweeter than you are , Ruth . CREEL And you ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man is for , is n't it , Tom ? HERFORD I do n't know anything else he 's good for . CREEL See ? You always put me in a good humor . Bye-bye  --  I 'll see you later . ( TOM goes to stand before his frieze . ) MCKENZIE ( Going to hall door with RUTH . ) I did n't mean to be cross  --  really . ( KEITH stands looking after her . ) HERFORD Ruth is looking awfully pretty and in good spirits this winter  --  is n't she ? MCKENZIE Um ! HERFORD She seems so sort of happy and successful . She is a howling success , too . It 's wonderful how she 's climbed up in that magazine . MCKENZIE ( With a sigh . ) Um ! HERFORD She 's a great little woman , Keith . You 're in luck to get her . p. 9 MCKENZIE ( Turning back to table . ) If I could only get those ideas out of her head . HERFORD What ideas ? MCKENZIE Oh , she has some queer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical and balanced . I suppose you ca n't expect that in a woman . They lack a man 's viewpoint , of course . HERFORD ( Smiling as he watches KEITH . ) Yes . MCKENZIE Of course , Mrs. Herford 's case is exceptional  --  you 've got her right here working with you under your wing  --  and that 's different  --  but I tell you  --  Oh , what 's the use ! ( Taking up some work from the table and going down to TOM 'S frieze . ) Well  --  how do you feel about it today ? HERFORD I do n't think I 've improved it any in this last change . I 've worked at it so long I do n't know whether it 's good or bad . MCKENZIE But it is a big improvement . You 're tired of it . You 've lost your judgment . HERFORD I admit that . I only made this last change because Mrs. Herford is so strong for it . She thinks it 's much better . MCKENZIE Mrs. Herford is right . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HERFORD No , I ca n't . I 'm sick of it . MCKENZIE I 'm sorry you feel this way about it , Governor . In my humble opinion you ' re afraid of it . You have n't let yourself go . The best things you 've done you 've always dashed off . HERFORD Yes , but hang it !  --  You ca n't dash off a fifty foot frieze for a three million dollar government building . Work ? You bet I 've worked . I 've put all I know into it  --  and I 'll be hanged if I know now whether it 's good or bad . MCKENZIE That 's bosh ! You 're dotty about it . HERFORD I 'd send the model off tomorrow if it was n't for Mrs. Herford . She wants me to keep on working . She says it lacks feeling . I suppose it does . It 's dead to me . I have no feeling about it any more . In the beginning I thought  --  by Jove  --  here 's the chance of my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow the more I 've worked the less I 've  --  ( He stops again  --  looking at his work . ) MCKENZIE It 's only because the blamed thing 's so important , that you 're sort of down about it . Of course , you 're going to get it . Buck up , Governor . I hate to see you lose your nerve . ( KEITH slaps TOM on the back and goes down to the table , taking up a drawing . ) Do you want me to begin the modeling for this now ? p. 11 HERFORD Yes , I wish you would . MCKENZIE Keep going , Governor . You know you 've got a big thing there . ( DR . REMINGTON comes in from the hall at the right . He is a man of sixty , blunt , lovable , with a great heart and keen sense of humor . ) DR . REMINGTON ( Looking about . ) How are the new quarters ? HERFORD ( Going to take REMINGTON 'S hand and thump him on the back . ) Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , doctor ? DR . REMINGTON How are you , McKenzie ? HERFORD What do you mean by staying away so long ? DR . REMINGTON I wanted to give you time to get over the first sensations . HERFORD Well  --  what do you think of it ? Pretty fine , un ? Do you acknowledge Ann did a good job ? DR . REMINGTON Oh , considering it 's a man 's work shop designed by a woman , I suppose it 's as good as could be expected . ( TOM and KEITH laugh . ) HERFORD That 's a good deal for you . See here  --  ( Pointing to cupboard. ) p. 12 MCKENZIE ( Going to open cupboard . ) All these drawers and shelves to hold things , and with little compartments just the right size for certain tools . HERFORD Great , is n't it ? Ann did all that . DR . REMINGTON A woman ought to be able to make a good cupboard . HERFORD But the best thing in the room is the light . MCKENZIE North , mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall knocked out for that . HERFORD They did n't want to do it at first , but the landlord gave in when Ann got hold of him . DR . REMINGTON I can imagine that . MCKENZIE ( Going to door . ) Are n't you coming in to see the workroom ? That 's the best part of it . DR . REMINGTON I 'll be in . HERFORD Keith , tell Mrs. Herford her father 's here . MCKENZIE I will . She 's working like mad to finish something . DR . REMINGTON Tell her to let the work go to thunder and come and see her dad . ( KEITH laughs and goes in , closing doors. ) p. 13 HERFORD Now , honestly  --  doctor  --  what do you think of the house and the studio combination ? DR . REMINGTON The whole idea 's wrong . A work shop 's a work shop and a home is a home . They ought to be kept separate . HERFORD I admit I kicked like a steer at first at the idea of having the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out all right . It 's immense . Ann was right . DR . REMINGTON As usual . HERFORD As usual . DR . REMINGTON Well , I hope it works . HERFORD Why should n't it ? DR . REMINGTON You 'll be so mixed up if you do n't look out , you wo n't know which is the parlor and which is the studio . HERFORD Oh  --  DR . REMINGTON You 'll be staying down stairs to keep house and Ann will be staying up stairs to keep shop . HERFORD I do n't know how I 'd handle the house , but Ann could keep shop all right . DR . REMINGTON You 're crazy . HERFORD Oh , come  --  she could . DR . REMINGTON She 's hypnotized you . p. 14 HERFORD Good Lord , she 's a sculptor . She 's got more ability in her little finger than Keith has in his whole body . She 's been at it ever since we were married . DR . REMINGTON When she ought to have been doing something else . She ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , there are other things in the world for a woman to do besides having children . DR . REMINGTON I do n't know any better business she can be in . A good mother is the greatest thing a woman can ever be . HERFORD I seem to have heard that before . DR . REMINGTON Yes , you 've heard it , and it 's so true that nobody pays any attention to it . HERFORD I 'm not so sure about that , but I 'll tell you one thing  --  I am dead sure of and that 's this  --  I 've done better work , Ann and I are more to each other because she 's worked with me . Where can you find anything to beat it ? We 're a damned sight happier than any other couple I know . We 're working together  --  for the same thing . DR . REMINGTON You love her . You 're blinded . Instead of being her husband , her protector  --  her master  --  you 've let her lead you , and she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , **51;1701;TOOLONG business , and she 'll make hell of it for you before she gets through . She 's put all the vitality , the energy , the nerve force  --  all she 's got into this work  --  but at the cost of something else  --  at the cost of something else . p. 15 HERFORD What ? DR . REMINGTON At the cost of the woman in her . HERFORD Oh , bosh ! You 're rabid on the woman subject , doctor . ( DAISY HERFORD , TOM 'S sister , comes in from the hall . She is a fresh , pretty , self-reliant looking young woman of thirty , attractively dressed in a severely simple and business-like blue frock . ) HERFORD Tom , will you sign these letters now ? Oh  --  Dr. Remington , I 'm awfully glad to see you . DR . REMINGTON How are you , Daisy ? HERFORD You have n't been here for four whole days and we 've done wonders in that time . Got pictures and curtains up down stairs . DR . REMINGTON I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HERFORD Oh , your tie 's awfully crooked . Pull it around . No , this way . And there 's a spot on it . Too bad ! ( Rubbing the tie with her handkerchief . ) It 's such a pretty one . You certainly do need a woman to take care of you  --  do n't you ? DR . REMINGTON I do n't know anyone who wants the job . HERFORD You do n't expect anyone to come to ask for it , do you ? p. 16 HERFORD See here , Daisy . You have all these dimensions wrong . Keith will have to give them to you again . HERFORD Oh ! I 'm sorry ! I 'll correct it . DR . REMINGTON It 's a good thing you ' re working for your own brother , Daisy , nobody else would have you . Do you count on your fingers ? HERFORD I do not . DR . REMINGTON ( Whispering to her . ) Be honest  --  I wo n't tell . HERFORD The idea ! DR . REMINGTON I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you ? HERFORD Sir , you insult me ! DR . REMINGTON Well , you put up a good bluff at being a business woman , Daisy  --  I give you credit for that . HERFORD Keep still . You 're the only person in the world who is n't impressed by my dignity  --  and  --  my  --  ability . DR . REMINGTON ( Putting his arm around her . ) I 'm much more impressed because you 're a sweet girl . HERFORD ( Patting his cheek . ) I 'm glad  --  the infatuation is very mutual . p. 17 DR . REMINGTON If I were about twenty-five years younger we might pull it off and keep it all in the family . Un ? HERFORD ( Laughing . ) I wish you were . I ca n't stand here flirting with you  --  I must skip down or I 'll lose my job . Wo n't I , TOM ? HERFORD ( Still correcting letters . ) That 's what . HERFORD Have you finished ? ( Going to table to get letters from TOM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistakes . HERFORD No  --  very nice , Daisy . You ' re getting to be a cracker jack . HERFORD ( To REMINGTON . ) You see ? Do n't you love the studio ? I 'm crazy about it . DR . REMINGTON We 're all more or less crazy . What did you do to the house ? HERFORD Wait till you see my room . That 's the best thing in the house . DR . REMINGTON Is it full of baby blue ribbon ? HERFORD No , sir . It 's severe and practical and useful  --  like me . ( She smiles at REMINGTON and goes to hall door . ) Going to stay to dinner  --  doctor ? p. 18 DR . REMINGTON Ca n't  --  thank you ! HERFORD Wish you could . ( She goes out . ) DR . REMINGTON Ca n't  --  thank you ! HERFORD Wish you could . ( She goes out . ) DR . REMINGTON She ought to be married . What have you dragged your sister into the business for ? HERFORD Oh , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says in her prayers every night  --  Oh ! Lord deliver me from this job and get me a husband . HERFORD ( Laughing . ) You 're off there . Daisy 's one woman who is fit for business . She has n't any especial ability  --  but with experience she 'll make good . Ann 's different of course . She 's a gifted woman . She has a finer critical sense than I have myself . DR . REMINGTON It 's always easy enough for a woman to criticise . HERFORD She holds me up to something . Gets the best out of me . She is n't satisfied with these models . If it was n't for her I 'd fire them off tomorrow . DR . REMINGTON The frieze for the government building ? p. 19 HERFORD Yes . DR . REMINGTON Good God , man ! You do n't mean to say you 're going to let her interfere in this ? HERFORD She 's right . DR . REMINGTON Right nothing ! This is your job  --  the biggest chance you ' ve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meddle in this . Do n't let any thing muddle you . HERFORD There 's something the matter with it . DR . REMINGTON You see  --  she 's confused you . You 've lost your grip . Too much criticism is the most dangerous and weakening thing in the world . Do n't be a damned fool and get befuddled on this thing . If you ever needed your iron nerve in your life you need it now . Do your work as you see it , and if you win you win on your own feet . If you fail you fail on your own feet . I tell you  --  ( Suddenly stopping and looking at the frieze . ) What is the devilish thing  --  anyway ? What 's it about ? HERFORD Well  --  what do you think it is ? DR . REMINGTON Damned if I know . They seem to be chasing something . Most of us are . This fellow 's all right . Nothing the matter with his anatomy . What 's he going to do ? Jump on that horse ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean if you 're the lucky devil you get a cold forty thousand for this ? HERFORD If  --  yes  --  DR . REMINGTON Well  --  all I 've got to say is the government is easy . MCKENZIE ( Opening the door of the workroom . ) Do n't you want me to carry that in for you , Mrs. Herford ? HERFORD ( Speaking from within . ) No  --  no  --  I 'd rather do it myself . MCKENZIE Be careful . It 's too heavy for you . HERFORD No , it is n't . ( ANN HERFORD enters from the workroom , carrying a figure of a woman about three feet high , in modeling wax . It is on a modeling board and she comes in slowly  --  balancing it carefully and puts it on table at the right . She has a strong , confident , but very feminine personality and wears a blue linen working smock , open at the throat  --  sleeves turned back  --  soiled and clay-stained . In the pocket is a cloth on which she wipes her hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . HERFORD Do n't touch it . p. 21 DR . REMINGTON Hello there . HERFORD Hello , daddy ! I could n't come in till I finished my lady . Is n't she nice ? She 's ready to be cast now . Come and look at her , Tom . She 's pretty good . HERFORD ( Going to the figure . ) She looks pretty good to me . DR . REMINGTON She looks a little chilly to me . Why do n't you put a full set of clothes on one just for a change , Ann ! HERFORD ( Going down to kiss and embrace her father warmly . ) Well you nice , horrid ; cross , sweet old thing . Why have n't you been here before ? Un ? ' Fess up . It 's because you do n't like the new arrangement . DR . REMINGTON How did you guess it ? HERFORD ( Examining the figure . ) That was a good guess , Ann . Your father 's so reticent  --  Nobody ever knows what he really thinks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 'll approve and apologize . DR . REMINGTON It 'd work all right if you 'd stay downstairs . HERFORD I 'm going to be upstairs and downstairs and in my lady 's chamber . That 's why it 's so perfect . I can keep an eye on the house and be right here with my work . ( Going back to the figure . ) What do you think of her , Tom ? p. 22 HERFORD She 's all right , bully . I tell you I 'm proud of her , doctor . They do n't make many like her . Ann , I mean  --  not this lady . DR . REMINGTON Un ! Perhaps it 's just as well . ( TOM goes to cupboard to get tools . ) HERFORD ( Laughing . ) I think I 'm awfully good-natured . You know , dad , I 'd rather you thought my work was good than anybody in the world beside Tom . In fact , it would quite turn my head if you said I had great ability . ( Sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll never say it . MILLICENT ( Bursting in from the hall . ) Oh , mother  --  the matinee was perfectly lovely . Grandfather , you ' re just the one I wanted to see ! Hello , Daddy . ( Rushing to REMINGTON , giving him a violent hug and kissing both cheeks . ) You darling for sending those chocolates . Five pounds , mother ! ( MILLICENT is an extremely pretty girl of sixteen , charmingly dressed . ) HERFORD You 're a fine doctor ! DR . REMINGTON ( Holding MILLICENT . ) Chocolate 's about the best medicine I know of if you want a girl to love you . ( MILLICENT goes back to ANN 's chair. ) p. 23 HERFORD Well , sweetheart  --  have you had a good time ? Is n't she big , father ? Look at her ! What am I going to do with a young lady instead of a little girl ? Every time she comes home , she takes my breath away . Have you had a nice day , dear ? ( Kissing MILLICENT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ! The luncheon was gorgeous and the play was too sweet ! Every minute of my vacation has been simply heavenly perfect ! I 'm crazy to tell the girls everything  --  but I think it 's too awful I have to go back to school to-morrow . HERFORD Yes , it is a terrible trial . MILLICENT Well , it is . New York 's so attractive now  --  and there 's so much to do ! Everybody 's in town  --  who is anybody . DR . REMINGTON ( Laughing aloud as he sits by the table . ) I 'm glad I 'm here . MILLICENT Fanny was in a box . DR . REMINGTON Who 's Fanny ? MILLICENT ( Taking off her hat . ) My dearest chum at school . And she had on her new  --  HERFORD What have you got in your ears ? MILLICENT Ear-rings , of course . p. 24 HERFORD Where did you get them ? MILLICENT I did n't steal them , mother . HERFORD Millicent ! Take them out , at once . MILLICENT Oh , mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't matter if every girl in Christendom wears them . It 's very bad taste for a girl of sixteen . Take them out . MILLICENT ( Taking the earrings out . ) Oh , mother ! You 're foolish ! Sixteen is old enough for anything ! DR . REMINGTON ( Rising . ) Well , the best way for me to keep out of a fight is to leave . I 'm going in to see this wonderful workroom . HERFORD Mind you say that 's good . DR . REMINGTON I 'll say it 's good if it is . ( REMINGTON goes into the workroom . TOM goes to work on his frieze . ) MILLICENT I do n't see why I ca n't do what other girls do . HERFORD You have powder on your nose  --  which I have positively forbidden . MILLICENT Oh , mother ! HERFORD You will not wear your hair that way again  --  either . p. 25 MILLICENT What ? HERFORD Brush it out of your eyes and look like a lady . MILLICENT Like a monkey ! This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look as if you had no mother to teach you anything . It 's been demoralizing for you in town . School is certainly the best place for a girl . MILLICENT Ca n't I stay over one more day ? HERFORD Not a minute . MILLICENT But I want you to take me to a special matinee to-morrow . It 's a play I 'm crazy to see . HERFORD You 've had too much of that sort of thing now  --  MILLICENT But Fanny 's mother is going to take her . HERFORD I have n't time to go with you tomorrow . MILLICENT Fanny 's mother 's going to take the time . HERFORD Fanny 's mother does n't work . MILLICENT I wish you did n't  --  I 've hardly seen you all this vacation . You 're always busy . These are the holidays and I think you ought to be with me all the time while I ' m home . HERFORD ( Putting an arm about MILLICENT , and kissing her . ) Do n't be cross with me , dear . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in the future than going to matinees. p. 26 MILLICENT But I want this now . Please , mother ! HERFORD Do n't ask me again , Millicent . You do n't understand . Please be reasonable , dear heart . Kiss me . Are n't we friends ? Do n't think I 'm horrid , Kitten ,  --  I ca n't bear to have you feel this way ! MILLICENT But I think it 's a shame . Fanny 's going to stay  --  and go some place for tea after the matinee . I 've never been to a hotel or any exciting place for tea in my life  --  and I think it 's perfectly awful . ( TOM laughs . ) I think you 're horrid to laugh , father . HERFORD I beg your pardon . MILLICENT See my pumps , dad . ( Going across to show him her shoes . ) Are n't they sweet ? HERFORD The most beautiful things I ever saw in my life . MILLICENT I love them , mother . HERFORD I 'm glad . MILLICENT These are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're so lovely to walk in . ( Walking up stage . ) They make you feel so light and airy and tall . ( Turning her ankle . ) Oh  --  I did n't mean to do that . I 'm not quite used to them yet . Mother  --  next year I 'm going to have a train . May n't I ? p. 27 HERFORD Heaven forbid ! MILLICENT Why , mother , lots of girls that age have them . HERFORD Do you know what you ought all to be doing ? MILLICENT What ? HERFORD Wearing skirts up to your knees till you 're twenty . MILLICENT Oh , horrors ! HERFORD And running and jumping and playing and growing into stunning women ready for anything . MILLICENT Ready for what ? HERFORD Ready for life  --  with strong bodies and fresh minds . That 's the way I 'd like to keep you . MILLICENT Well , I 'm glad you 're not regulating the laws , mother . Oh , dad , ask mother to take me tomorrow . HERFORD Your mother knows best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . MILLICENT ( Going to hall door . ) I think it 's perfectly dreadful . It just spoils my whole vacation . HERFORD I 'm extremely sorry . MILLICENT ( Turning at door . ) Could n't you , Mummie ? Wo n't you telegraph Miss Lawrence I ' m not coming ? p. 28 HERFORD That 's quite impossible , dear . When you come home for Easter , we 'll have some good times . MILLICENT Oh , Easter ! I want this now . ( Going out . ) I 'm very unhappy ! HERFORD Poor Kid ! She does want to stay . Could n't you  --  HERFORD Now , Tom  --  do n't make it any harder for me . It 's absurd the things girls are doing now-a-days . I wish to goodness other mothers were n't such fools . They do n't keep girls young . HERFORD How are you going to suppress the rising generation ? HERFORD This is just the time in her whole life when she needs discipline , and a quiet , healthy , simple , normal routine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything I can find . HERFORD She 's a handful . No doubt about it . ( There is a pause as TOM works and ANN sits at the right of the table . ) HERFORD ( Absently playing with a pencil . ) Tom , you do n't mind what father says , do you ? You like the house and the studio together  --  do n't you ? HERFORD ( Examining a sketch . ) You bet I do . p. 29 HERFORD Then it does n't matter what anybody else in the world thinks . HERFORD ( Going to her at the end of the table . ) Ann  --  am I a fool about you ? HERFORD Did he say that , too ? HERFORD ( Sitting on the end of table . ) You come before my work . HERFORD Oh , no , I do n't . No woman comes before any man 's work . HERFORD I 'm working for you and because of you . HERFORD Yes , but you 'd work just as well without me . HERFORD No , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't complain . Just love me . ( She leans against him . He kisses her , holding her close . ) HERFORD Tell me something . Which comes first to you  --  me or your work ? HERFORD There is n't any first about it . My work is my work and you are you . HERFORD I want you to love me first and last and above  --  everything else , and then work because you 're clever and because  --  HERFORD Because you let me . ( Laughing and running a finger down his nose . ) Oh , you man ! You are so funny ! Even you , Tom  --  even you do n't quite understand  --  how it is. p. 30 HERFORD Did n't you begin to work in the first place because you  --  HERFORD Because I was with you ? No  --  but because I wanted something to do  --  and to do well . Something besides loving . A man can do both . So can a woman . Oh , Tom  --  ( Going to his model . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ' m afraid I wo n't . HERFORD That 's ridiculous . You ' re tired of it . Put it away for a week and then go at it again  --  and an inspiration will come . That 's what it needs . HERFORD That 's easy enough to say . HERFORD I 've never known you to feel this way about your work before . What is it , dear ? Does n't the chance itself inspire you ? Why , the eyes of the whole country are on this competition . The man who wins it will be  --  well , a bigger thing could n't happen to him . HERFORD Oh , I know  --  I know  --  and there 's also $40,000 in it . HERFORD Yes , the money  --  think of it ! It would pay for the house , put you out of debt so the strain would be lifted entirely . HERFORD You need n't try to boost me any more , Ann . I 've dried up on it . I have n't anything more to put into it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have n't . If you stop now , you stop just this side of something big . You ' ve got it in you . Get it out . I know  --  I know , Tom , what power you have . Grit your teeth and make one more tremendous go at it and hit it . HERFORD I wo n't hit anything higher in this . HERFORD If something could only come to you  --  move you  --  HERFORD I ca n't go beyond myself . I know my limitations HERFORD There are no limitations . You must go on  --  and on  --  HERFORD I 've tried to lash myself into it  --  I want to win more than I ever wanted anything in my life . But I tell you it 's dead  --  and unless a miracle happens , that 's the way it will stand . HERFORD Tom , listen .  --  I 've wanted to tell you something for a long time , but I did n't have the courage until I was sure  --  and now I am sure . HERFORD Of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  while I 've been urging you on  --  living with it and agonizing over it  --  an idea has come to me  --  for a frieze like this . At first I thought the idea was too big for me  --  impossible  --  that I never could carry it out  --  and then I said  --  I wo n't let myself be afraid . I will do it , and it 's grown and grown night and day till it 's taken possession of me  --  and now I 've got it . It 's all strong and clear and sure . I 've done the sketches and  --  ( She hesitates nervously. ) p. 32 HERFORD And what  --  ? HERFORD Tom , I want you to look at them . HERFORD Well  --  HERFORD And  --  and if you think it 's better than yours  --  I want you to use it  --  take it . HERFORD You funny girl ! ( She turns away . ) Why , Ann  --  you 're not serious ? ( She nods . ) My dear girl , I have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful sketches , but good heavens , child  --  you know  --  you know how tremendous this thing is just as well as I do . HERFORD ( Turning quickly . ) Yes , I do . But I tell you something has come to me . My idea is n't charming  --  it 's big ! Oh , I knew you 'd look like that when I told you . You ca n't believe it yet , of course  --  but I  --  I want you to see my drawings  --  There 's something there  --  something alive and new as sure as I 'm standing here before you , Tom . Something I 've vaguely felt for years has come now in full force  --  and I offer it to you , dear  --  if you want it . HERFORD ( Throwing an arm about her . ) You generous darling ! It 's like you to do this . I love you for it . I 'm grateful , dear . But , Ann , little woman  --  you could n't do anything for a scheme as big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him quickly . ) Why do you take that for granted ? Why do you say that before you 've seen my sketches ? HERFORD Well  --  where are they ? Let me see what you 've got . HERFORD Wait till to-night when we ' re alone  --  after everybody 's gone . HERFORD No , now  --  I want to see them now . Right away . HERFORD But  --  HERFORD What 's the use of wasting time ? Let 's get at the thing and know what you 're talking about . Where are they ? Where have you got them ? HERFORD Come on then , they 're down in my cupboard . ( Starting to hall door . ) HERFORD No , do n't come with me . I do n't want you to explain anything  --  I want the whole idea to strike me fresh . Do n't come . HERFORD Oh , but  --  HERFORD That 's the only way  --  if you want me to get a clear impression . Where are they ? HERFORD In the second drawer of my cupboard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulders . ) And I 'm going to tell you the truth  --  just as I see it . If it 's good , all right ; if it 's bad , all right . I 'm going to hit hard  --  right between the eyes  --  and I expect you to take it  --  like a man . ( She nods her head  --  looking at him steadily . He goes out . There is a pause . ANN goes to look at TOM 'S frieze. ) p. 34 CREEL ( Outside . ) May I see Ann now , Tom ? HERFORD ( Outside . ) Yes  --  go on up . Excuse me , I 'm in a hurry . CREEL Ann , are you there ? HERFORD Yes , I'm. here . Come up , Ruth . CREEL ( Coming in . ) Hello , dear . HERFORD Oh , I 'm so glad to see you . I did n't know you were here . CREEL They would n't let me get near you . What 's the matter ? HERFORD Ruth  --  Tom 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his best work ; and do you know what I 've done ? CREEL What ? HERFORD Asked him to look at something of mine  --  and to use my idea  --  if he thinks it 's better than his . CREEL He 'll never think it . HERFORD Why not ? CREEL No man could possibly think a woman 's idea was bigger than his . HERFORD Un  --  you do n't know Tom . He 'll look at it as honestly and impersonally as if another man had done it . p. 35 CREEL But he is n't infallible . He may be mistaken about it . HERFORD He wo n't be . I 'd put Tom 's judgment up against the whole world . CREEL It must be wonderful to love a man like that . To believe way down in your toes that he knows more than you do . I 'm so sick of pretending that I 'm overawed by a man 's superior intelligence , that I do n't know what to do . Why , I have to manage every man on the magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Those are your weapons . CREEL Yes , and I hate them . I never dare to say what I think in a sensible , businesslike way . It would be such a relief to say  --  " I know it 's wrong , and that settles it  --  you go to the devil " ; but I have to smile and smile and appeal . I ca n't even be my real self with Keith  --  he hates my work so . I 'd give anything on earth if he were like Tom . HERFORD Why do n't you try to come to a complete understanding with Keith ? Now 's the time to do it  --  not after you 're married . CREEL I 'm a coward . I ca n't bear to hurt him . HERFORD You have n't convinced him that your work is necessary to your happiness . He wants you to live for him alone  --  to be the mother of his children . p. 36 CREEL But I do n't want children . HERFORD Oh , Ruth  --  that 's an awful thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be a good mother . I think children are wonderful , beautiful , adorable things . I think they 're the most important things in the world  --  but I 'm not the Mother type . My work has taken it out of me . HERFORD But I 'm a mother , and I work . It 's quite possible . CREEL Oh , I do n't know , even in your case something might happen to interfere with your work . HERFORD Nothing ! Nothing ever can . CREEL It 's children  --  children  --  that hold a woman back . I do n't care how strong , how clever , how great a gift she may have , if she brings children into the world there may come a time when  --  HERFORD Nonsense  --  do n't be old-fashioned . Be the woman of the future . Make it possible  --  make it right . CREEL Un  --  you see , Tom has helped you . Keith never will . He 'll always hate my work . HERFORD The trouble is you look like the little cuddly kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't see you as anything else . p. 37 CREEL Nobody can . Everybody says , is n't it funny you have such a responsible position and you 're so feminine . Feminine ! I 'm sick of the word . Of course I 'm feminine . I like pretty things to wear  --  and I 'm afraid of mice  --  but that 's no reason I should pretend I have n't any brains and bow down to a man all my life . HERFORD ( Coming in from hall in time to hear RUTH 'S last speech . ) Hello , Ruth . Still at it , I see  --  pounding the men . CREEL They need it . HERFORD ( Going over to put her hand on RUTH 'S shoulder . ) How are you , old girl ? CREEL ( Patting DAISY 'S hand . ) Fine ! How are you ? HERFORD Ann , here are some letters for you to sign . HERFORD ( Taking her chair to head of table and sitting to sign letters . ) Daisy knocks all your arguments flat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just what you say a woman ca n't be  --  calm , sensible and businesslike . No flattery and wheedling in her methods . CREEL ( Crushing a piece of paper and throwing it at DAISY . ) Daisy thinks she 's the only woman in the world who really ought to work . p. 38 HERFORD No , I do n't  --  but you 're not in my class . I 'm working because I have to . There 's no man in my horizon . You both have men to fall back on . That 's why I do n't think either of you ought to work . HERFORD Oh , but there 's something more in working than merely making a living . It 's a salvation to women . They need it just as much as men do . CREEL Of course they do . HERFORD Never ! HERFORD The arguments about a woman are all so silly . Everybody 's so terribly afraid she 's going to hurt somebody if she grows an inch or does anything new . I notice we never hear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interfere with his home life . We despise a man if he does n't use all the ability he has , but two thirds of the women in the world are n't using their brains at all , are absolutely undeveloped , living in a little treadmill circle because nothing else is expected of them . I tell you the more a woman knows  --  the more she is trained and disciplined till she is a vital part of the big general world  --  the more she has to give to her children and to the home . Tom knows it and that 's why he 's so willing for me to do what I ' m doing . HERFORD Oh , Ann ! He lets you do it because you 're with him . If it were some other kind of work , that separated you  --  you 'd find he feels just as any other man does about his wife working . p. 39 HERFORD Our scheme is a success because it 's the natural right relation between men and women . HERFORD Oh  --  HERFORD We prove it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been put to the test . You have n't struck a snag yet . HERFORD But I have put it to the test . HERFORD How ? HERFORD I 've just asked Tom to do a thing that will show whether he sees my work and my right to work as he does a man 's . HERFORD What did you ask him to do ? HERFORD I 'll tell you later . HERFORD I 'll bet you a five pound box  --  that if it ever comes to an issue , you will be just a woman  --  his wife , to Tom  --  and he 'll smash up your work like that  --  ( Snapping her fingers . ) HERFORD I 'll bet you that hat you liked with the green feather , that you 're wrong . HERFORD Shake . CREEL I witness this deal , and I hope to goodness you win , Ann  --  but I hae me doots . I 'm a little skeptical on the man question . p. 40 HERFORD If you did n't have Keith , or some other man . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone in your glorious independence . I do n't think your freedom will cut so much ice with you when you ' re a lonely , dried-up old maid . ( She goes into workroom . ) HERFORD Daisy 's such a bachelor maid herself  --  she argues just like a man . Sometimes , though , she rather puzzles me . Something comes into her voice or face that contradiets her whole personality . CREEL Ann  --  I 'm going to tell you something . I think I know what it is that puzzles you in Daisy . HERFORD What ? CREEL You  --  I  --  you 'll think I 'm silly . It 's so little  --  so vague I can seareely explain it  --  and yet sometimes I feel it so strongly . HERFORD What ? What do you mean ? CREEL If Keith did n't belong to me I never would have guessed it  --  HERFORD What are you talking about ? CREEL I think  --  if I  --  did n't exist  --  that  --  well , that Daisy is  --  fond of Keith , herself  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Oh , Ruth  --  impossible ! p. 41 CREEL I knew you 'd say that . I 'm sorry I told you . It seems absurd but  --  HERFORD Daisy 's not in love with anyone  --  never has been . She does n't care much for men . CREEL ( Shrugging her shoulders . ) That 's what we keep on saying . ( DR . REMINGTON comes in from workroom . ) Oh , how  --  do  --  you  --  do , Dr. Remington . I did n't know you were here . DR . REMINGTON I 'm not . I 'm clearing out . ( Going to get his hat and stick . ) ( KEITH comes in from workroom . ) HERFORD ( Pointedly  --  looking from RUTH to KEITH . ) Come on , father . We 're de trop . Keith , Ruth 's going to be here for dinner . Wo n't you stay , too ? MCKENZIE Thank you , Mrs. Herford . I 'd love to . HERFORD Then I 'll allow you to take her home . DR . REMINGTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark ? CREEL Not with a strong man by my side . DR . REMINGTON We are of some use then ? p. 42 CREEL A little  --  at times . HERFORD Father , I notice that even you are a little anxious nowadays to have your masculine superiority mentioned occasionally  --  for fear it may be entirely overlooked . DR . REMINGTON Yes  --  I ' m grateful for a kind word from womankind . HERFORD Come on and look at my house , you poor downtrodden lamb . DR . REMINGTON Lead me in the way that I should go . ( She takes him out through hall . ) MCKENZIE ( To RUTH . ) Do n't go down yet . CREEL I must go down and beautify a little for dinner . MCKENZIE You 're beautiful enough . Tell me you did n't mean anything you said a while ago . ( DAISY comes in from workroom . ) HERFORD ( As RUTH starts again to hall door . ) Going downstairs ? CREEL Yes  --  are you ? HERFORD In a minute . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll skip and leave you to work it out . You ought to be able to . You seem to have exactly the same ideas about things in general . ( She goes out laughing. ) p. 43 MCKENZIE What does she mean ? HERFORD Oh , I do n't know . Keith , look at this , will you ? Tom says I have it all wrong . MCKENZIE Sure .  --  What is it ? ( DAISY sits at the right of the table . KEITH stands at the other side . He laughs . ) You still make figures like a woman , Daisy . ( He mumbles to himself as he adds a column of figures . ) Add it again , will you ? I do n't get that . ( DAISY takes the paper and adds the column , counting on her fingers . KEITH . taking up another sheet of paper , does n't see this . ) HERFORD ( As she finishes and corrects it . ) Oh , of course . How could I make such a mistake ? MCKENZIE You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HERFORD ( Glancing at him quickly . ) I suppose so . MCKENZIE Um  --  this does n't seem to be just straight . A  --  um  --  I ca n't tell just what Tom meant to say . Where 's the original ? Where 's your dictation ? HERFORD Let 's see . ( Looking at the sheet KEITH holds and then beginning to turn the leaves of her note-book . ) That was to-day . I have it here . Oh , sakes !  --  they all look alike . Here it is  --  no it is n't . Oh , no  --  I ca n't find it . Oh , just correct that and I 'll copy it to-night . p. 44 MCKENZIE ( Sitting and correcting the paper . ) You 're a wonder , Daisy . You do n't mind sitting up late to get your letters off , do you ? HERFORD Oh , no  --  I 'm healthy . MCKENZIE Does n't Ruth look tired to you tonight ? Little , delicate thing ! HERFORD I suppose she 's had a hard day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's come between us . Always has . It 's taking her away from me . It 's killing her . I tell you business is a curse for women . They ought n't to go near it . HERFORD What if they ca n't help it ? MCKENZIE Well  --  not her kind . Of course , you 'll be all right when you get your training . You 're strong and independent and there 's some reason for you  --  but Ruth , never ! HERFORD Funny , is n't it ? MCKENZIE What ? HERFORD Some of us like it  --  and some of us do n't . MCKENZIE I can understand why you , but  --  HERFORD Oh , yes , of course , you understand me perfectly . MCKENZIE Yes , I can understand why you want to get a business training . You do n't care anything for men and you 're independent and like your own way . p. 45 HERFORD You 're the wisest man I know . MCKENZIE Un ? Sometimes you kind of stump me , Daisy  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to guess about me . I 'm a plain , sensible , practical woman  --  meant to take care of myself , as you say . MCKENZIE Yes , and you ' re the best friend and the  --  HERFORD Oh  --  MCKENZIE Yes , you are . If I have any ability you 're the only one who believes it . I do n't think Ruth understands that side of me at all . HERFORD ( Laughing . ) We all like a little sympathy , do n't we ? MCKENZIE I need it  --  with my temperament . HERFORD You ought to have a job like mine where your feelings have n't anything to do with the case . MCKENZIE ( Smiling at her . ) Everything 's always all right with you  --  is n't it , Daisy ? HERFORD Always . MCKENZIE It 's great to be born cheerful . HERFORD And there 's something in the fact of having to be cheerful because nobody would care a darn if you weren't. p. 46 MCKENZIE Yes , but you 're happy , are n't you ? Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? MCKENZIE I feel it the minute you come in . HERFORD You mean I ' m always the same  --  no moods  --  no subtle fascinations and mysteries  --  like most women ? MCKENZIE Exactly . The thing I like about you most is that I understand you so well . Now , Ruth  --  every time I see her there 's a new  --  something I ' m mystified about . HERFORD It must be strange to know that someone 's going to wonder what you mean every time you move or look or sigh or smile or do your hair this way or turn your head that way . MCKENZIE You would n't like that  --  would you ? Would n't be bothered with it . HERFORD No , I could n't be  --  bothered with it . MCKENZIE My , but you 're independent . You ' re a dear , splendid girl , Daisy  --  but no man would ever think he could ask you to marry him unless he had an awfully big bank roll to offer . ( DR . REMINGTON opens the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  There is an awkward pause . KEITH turns and goes into the workroom , closing the door . The Doctor takes his hat and stick. ) p. 47 HERFORD I suppose that speech sounded rather queer . He was talking about Ruth , of course . DR . REMINGTON Do n't apologize or you 'll make me suspicious . HERFORD Now  --  DR . REMINGTON It sounded very much as if he was making love to you . HERFORD Oh  --  DR . REMINGTON I wish to God he would . You 'd be a much better wife for him than the other one . HERFORD You  --  DR . REMINGTON You know you would . Why do n't you go in and get him ? Cut the other one out . HERFORD How dare you say such a thing to me ? DR . REMINGTON Why should n't I say it ? HERFORD Because you have no right to . I have n't the slightest interest in Keith McKenzie  --  not the slightest . DR . REMINGTON No , I can see that . HERFORD I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . DR . REMINGTON Well  --  forget it . HERFORD ( Getting more and more embarrassed . ) I do n't like it . I 'm not that sort . p. 48 DR . REMINGTON What sort are you then ? HERFORD Oh , do n't talk that way to me . You do n't think from anything I 've ever done or said  --  DR . REMINGTON ( Whispering . ) I do n't think anything  --  I do n't know anything . HERFORD I do n't see why you said it . ( She turns and goes out quickly through hall . ) DR . REMINGTON ( Looking after her comprehendingly . ) Um ! MCKENZIE ( Coming in from the workroom . ) Where 's the governor ? DR . REMINGTON Do n't know . McKenzie , did it ever occur to you that Daisy 's a damned fine woman ? MCKENZIE Daisy ? Yes , she 's all right . DR . REMINGTON I mean  --  that she 'd make a good wife . MCKENZIE Oh , wife nothing . She 'll never marry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women are the marrying kind . MCKENZIE Oh , no . DR . REMINGTON Oh , yes . I know ' em  --  like a book . I understand you 're to be married in the fall . p. 49 MCKENZIE ( With a sigh . ) Yes . DR . REMINGTON You do n't seem very cheerful about it . MCKENZIE Oh , yes , I am . DR . REMINGTON Well , if anything goes wrong you can  --  MCKENZIE What ? DR . REMINGTON You can look around a little . MCKENZIE What do you mean ? DR . REMINGTON Oh , nothing  --  well , I must go on . ( Starting to door . ) HERFORD ( Rushing in from hall  --  carrying a large roll of drawings . ) Where 's Ann ? DR . REMINGTON I left her downstairs where she belongs . HERFORD I 've been looking at something she 's done that I did n't know anything about . Keith , here 's a section of it . Look at it . MCKENZIE ( Going to the table as TOM unrolls the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's done what ? ( The three men stand above the table . ) HERFORD Look at it . I did n't know she had it in her .  --  It 's a beautiful thing  --  in fact , I  --  I 'm not sure but that it 's great . Look it over , Keith  --  tell me what you think ? p. 50 DR . REMINGTON What are you talking about ? What has she done ? HERFORD ( Going to his own model . ) The drawings for a frieze like this . DR . REMINGTON What ? ( ANN comes in from the hall . ) HERFORD Ann , I 've seen your drawings . HERFORD Well ? HERFORD They 're beautiful . HERFORD ( Scarcely able to speak . ) Oh  --  HERFORD It 's almost  --  big  --  your idea ; in fact , I do n't know but that it is . HERFORD Oh , Tom  --  I  --  it 's too good to be true . I  --  Do you think that ? ( Coming up to table . ) MCKENZIE They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could do something half as good . ( KEITH goes into workroom . ) HERFORD ( Turning to TOM . ) Have you told father what I  --  HERFORD No . HERFORD Go on . Tell him . HERFORD Well , I  --  p. 51 HERFORD Oh , you do n't think it 's  --  good enough ? DR . REMINGTON Good enough for what ? HERFORD I 've offered an idea to Tom . I thought he might like it better than his own  --  and if he did , I wanted him to take it  --  use it ! DR . REMINGTON Why , you  --  HERFORD It 's very  --  very fine , Ann  --  but  --  HERFORD But not good enough for that . HERFORD Well , not  --  so strong as mine , dear . I could n't possibly use it . It 's a woman 's work . Your treatment is too light for a huge building like that . It is n't in the range of what they want . HERFORD ( Quietly . ) Oh ! HERFORD But do you know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  taken me off my feet . HERFORD Oh  --  HERFORD It 's done what you wanted it to . Lifted me out of myself and put new life into me . HERFORD Oh , I 'm glad  --  DR . REMINGTON That 's great ! HERFORD She 's an inspiration to me , Doctor  --  every day of her life . You do n't know what I owe to her  --  and her belief in me. p. 52 DR . REMINGTON Yes I do . Ann , I 'm proud of you . HERFORD I 'll go to work with fresh air in my lungs now .  --  You 've  --  I ca n't tell you how much you ' ve done for me , Ann . HERFORD I 'm so thankful . HERFORD ( Going to his frieze . ) You 've sort of started something in me  --  shaken me up . And by Jove , I begin to feel as if I might  --  HERFORD Might win ? DR . REMINGTON Good ! HERFORD Glorious ! DR . REMINGTON Keep on thinking it . HERFORD I ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even if it  --  is only  --  a woman 's work . HERFORD Oh , I did n't mean to  --  DR . REMINGTON I do n't know what greater thing you could want it to do  --  than to inspire your husband . HERFORD Perhaps I ' m foolish , but I  --  I do n't want it to die  --  and be thrown aside . I 'd like to make the models . HERFORD Well , I 'll use it some time , dear  --  but why bother with the models now ? HERFORD Why could n't I make my models and send them in  --  for this ? ( Pointing to TOM 'S frieze . ) Why could n't I  --  why could n't I ? p. 53 HERFORD and DR . REMINGTON What ? HERFORD I mean it . HERFORD Why , you  --  DR . REMINGTON No you do n't . HERFORD I do  --  I mean it with my whole soul . DR . REMINGTON Ann , why do you want to do a thing like that ? HERFORD It would only mean enormous labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the range , dear girl .  --  HERFORD That does n't matter . There 'll be plenty of mediocre stuff sent in . HERFORD But why  --  DR . REMINGTON Why do you want to do anything so foolish ? HERFORD Because I made it . Because it 's been in my heart for years . Because it 's my work . I do n't mind failure  --  I only want to try  --  to send it out and let it stand its little chance with the rest . I love it , and it means more to me than I can possibly tell you . HERFORD But , Ann , dear child , it is n't what they want . DR . REMINGTON What if they did want it ? What if they took it ? What if you did the finest thing in the world ? That 's not what you were meant for . That 's not the greatest thing you can do . p. 54 HERFORD It 's what I want to do . Why should it be held back from me ? DR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . You ' re a married woman  --  a mother . HERFORD Do n't you think I 'm a good mother ? DR . REMINGTON Of course you 're a good mother . That 's why you ought to have more children ;  --  this studio ought to be a nursery . HERFORD Oh , father ! Wo n't a woman ever mean anything more to you than something to bring children into the world ? How about me myself ? Do n't you suppose I ' m a better woman and wife and mother because I ' m trying to use what God gave me ? Do n't you suppose I love Tom and Millicent more because I have a bigger heart and brain and soul to love them with , than if I ' d let myself dry up  --  a little narrow woman , afraid of my own instincts ? You ca n't tell a woman any more she ca n't do things just because she 's a woman . DR . REMINGTON Tom , if you let her do this you 're a fool . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She 's done the thing . If she wants to send it in , why not ? Why not ? What harm can it do ? If you want it so much  --  go ahead , dear . Do it . HERFORD Oh  --  thank you , Tom . Thank you . p. 55 DR . REMINGTON Damn it ! It 's none of my business , but you ' re getting ready to raise merry hell here some day . ( TOM and ANN laugh as REMINGTON goes out . ) HERFORD Oh , Tom , I 'm so happy it almost frightens me . We have so much . Our life is the ideal thing for a man and woman .  --  The perfect thing  --  and do you know why ? HERFORD It 's because you 're the most wonderful woman in the world . HERFORD No  --  it 's because you 're a great , generous , open-minded , big-natured , perfectly sane , well-balanced , level-headed , progressive , unprejudiced man  --  and I adore you ! ( She throws her arms about his neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room in the IIerford House , about nine o'clock in the evening , four months later . DAISY is singing in the library  --  voices are heard as she finishes . ELLEN , a neat Irish maid , comes in from the hall carrying a silver after  --  dinner coffee service . HERFORD ( Coming in from the library as she finishes the song . ) Here 's your , coffee , girls . Come in here . Put the flowers on the small table , Ellen . ( ELLEN puts the vase of flowers on the small table on the right , and makes room for the coffee service on the table toward the center of the stage . ) ( RUTH comes in from the library with a book . ) HERFORD ( Pouring a cup of coffee at left of the table . ) One ? CREEL No  --  no sugar . HERFORD Ann , here 's your coffee . HERFORD ( Calling from the library . ) I do n't want any , thank you . What time is it , Daisy ? HERFORD About nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' m waiting for the last mail . p. 57 HERFORD Well , do n't . A watched pot you know  --  ( To RUTH . ) She 's watched every mail for a week . I almost think Ann will be more disappointed than Tom himself if he does n't win the competition . ( They take their coffee to the fire . ) CREEL I hope to goodness he does . Ann 's so dead sure of him . HERFORD Almost too sure . I 'm beginning to be frightened myself . If Tom does n't hear to-night I 'm afraid he 's lost . The time 's up . CREEL Awful if he should lose . HERFORD ( Stopping her music and rushing into the room and across to a window at the left . ) That 's the postman . ELLEN No , ma'am . Beggin ' your pardon  --  it ai n't . I 'm listening , too . HERFORD ( Laughing and turning in the window . ) Are you , Ellen ? ELLEN I 've got the habit meself lately of watchin ' fer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hear the whistle I drop whatever I ' m doin ' like it was hot  --  and run . HERFORD Do you ? p. 58 ELLEN And just before I open the door I say  --  ( crossing herself ) The Holy Saints be praised , I hope it 's come this time  --  whatever it is they 're lookin ' fer . ( The women all laugh . ) HERFORD Keep on praying , Ellen . ELLEN ( Going to hall door . ) Faith , I will . HERFORD And watch for the mail to-night and bring it up the minute it comes . ELLEN Yes , ma'am . ( She goes out through hall . ) HERFORD Oh , dear ! It gets worse as the time grows shorter . HERFORD Ann , working yourself up like this wo n't make Tom get the commission . Stop thinking about it . HERFORD ( Going to put her cheek against DAISY 'S arm and walking away again . ) But I ca n't , Daisy Dimple . He ought to hear to-night if he 's ever going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all over and we know one way or the other  --  and can settle down to ordinary life again . It 's almost given me nervous indigestion . ( DAISY goes to sit below the table , and sews on the waist of lace and chiffon which is in the work basket ) p. 59 CREEL ( Jumping so that her cup and saucer almost fall . ) Oh , Ann , you 're getting me so excited I 'll listen for the postman all the rest of my life . HERFORD I know I shall . Oh , Tom must get it . He must ! CREEL By the way , Daisy , did you ever pay Ann the bet ? HERFORD Oh , yes , she paid . HERFORD Yes , I paid , but I do n't think Ann won the bet . HERFORD Of course I did . CREEL Why not ? HERFORD She has n't proved yet that Tom and she are working on the same basis . ( To ANN . ) Tom let you send your models in to amuse yourself . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to amuse me  --  but because he knew it was right . If Tom wins I must telegraph Millicent . ( Lifting and kissing a picture of Millicent , which stands in a frame on the table . ) Bless her ! I want to see her so ! I could not let her come home Easter vacation be- cause it was just at the time when I was working day and night on my models . There was such a little while to get them off . HERFORD She certainly did want to come home . I used to get about three letters a day begging me to ask Ann to let her . p. 60 HERFORD It was awfully hard . CREEL But it was best , of course . HERFORD How 's the waist getting on , Daisy ? HERFORD Almost finished . CREEL ( Following DAISY . ) Oh , that 's pretty ! HERFORD Slip it on , so we can see . ( Helping DAISY into the waist . ) Daisy makes most of her clothes after midnight  --  she gets an idea all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new creation . Is n't that good looking ? CREEL Perfectly fascinating . HERFORD See ? I did it all by hand . CREEL Sweet ! That gives it the air . HERFORD Of course . HERFORD Where are the pins ? I want to try something . HERFORD ( Getting her basket from the table . ) What ? CREEL I 'll hold it . HERFORD ( Pinning the waist . ) Only a hair 's breadth , but it makes all the difference in the world . There , see how much better that is ? It makes you longer here . p. 61 CREEL Oh , much better . HERFORD Make me as long as you can  --  for goodness ' sake . Do n't you see how much better I am through here than I was last year ? HERFORD ( Pinning the waist . ) Of course . Oh , the female form divine is gradually coming back to what it was in the beginning . HERFORD When I think of the shape I used to make myself , I ca n't get my breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to breathe and move and feel alive ?

( TOM , REMINGTON , and KEITH come in from the hall . ) HERFORD What 's going on ? DR . REMINGTON What are you trying to do , Ruth  --  swim or fly ? HERFORD We 're just saying that the waist measure is expanding as we broaden in our ideas . MCKENZIE Is that the fashion now ? CREEL Yes  --  broad and free . p. 62 DR . REMINGTON That 's one thing you women have to acknowledge  --  men have more sense about that than you have . ANN , RUTH , DAISY What ? DR . REMINGTON Our figures . We 've had the same shape since the garden of Eden and you 've had hundreds of absolutely different kinds . ( They all laugh . ) HERFORD Hold still , Daisy . ( She accidentally sticks a pin into DAISY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! HERFORD Oh , I 'm so sorry . You seem to be so close to your clothes , Daisy . DR . REMINGTON What are you doing to her ? HERFORD She 's sticking pins into me . HERFORD For her own good . Is n't that pretty ? KEITH , REMINGTON , TOM What ? HERFORD The waist . MCKENZIE Is that new ? HERFORD Do you mean to say you do n't realize I have on something different from what I wore at dinner ? CREEL No use dressing for Keith . He never sees anything . p. 63 HERFORD Well , I 'm going to undress now . Perhaps that will interest you more . ( ANN begins to unfasten the waist . ) DR . REMINGTON Much more . Why in the devil do n't you have it button in front so you can get out of it ? MCKENZIE And if you want to show how strong-minded and wise you are  --  why do n't you put good big buttons on it that you can get hold of ? Like this . ( Buttoning his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HERFORD Because we prefer nice tiny little hooks and eyes that nobody can see , that are always coming off , and catch in our hair ; the lace , and everything in sight  --  and take an hour to fasten . DR . REMINGTON Sensible , is n't it ? HERFORD ( To the men . ) And why do n't you let your strong , manly necks be perfectly free and natural as God made you instead of wearing stiff high things you ca n't bend in , that crack and squeak when you move ? Sensible , is n't it ? Was that the postman ? ( Pushing DAISY . ) HERFORD No , it was not . DR . REMINGTON The postman habit is getting on my nerves . You 're all jumping and listening till you 'll have St. Vitus Dance if you do n't stop . p. 64 HERFORD How can we help it , dad ? DR . REMINGTON After all , a few other competitions have been lost and won  --  and people have lived through it . It 's not the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you had $40,000 at stake . HERFORD Oh , Tom , it 's not just the money you 're thinking about . HERFORD Oh , no  --  Tom 's not thinking about the money at all  --  just the fame and glory . MCKENZIE They could keep the money if I were in it  --  I would n't ask for anything more than winning . DR . REMINGTON Well  --  they might let you win something if they did n't have to pay you for it . HERFORD Oh , Keith  --  I 'd hate to offer you the forty thousand . CREEL If anybody ever does and I 'm in the family  --  I advise you to take it . ( ELLEN comes in from the hall and takes out the coffee tray . There is general conversation , laughter and movement . ) HERFORD Well , are n't we going to have some auction ? Who wants to play ? I know you do , daddy . DR . REMINGTON I have to get even with you for that last rubber , Tom . p. 65 HERFORD You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you , Doctor . DR . REMINGTON Come on . CREEL I 'm afraid to play against you . ( RUTH and DAISY go into library with REMINGTON . DAISY begins to play bright waltz music . ) HERFORD ( To TOM and KEITH . ) Coming ? HERFORD You go , Keith . I want to look at the paper a minute . MCKENZIE Oh , my game 's no good . You go . HERFORD Now do n't stay out here and listen and wait . If there is any mail , Ellen will bring it straight up . HERFORD I 'll be with you  --  in two minutes . HERFORD Anyway  --  to-night does n't necessarily decide it . There may be still two or three more days . Is n't that so , Keith ? MCKENZIE Yes  --  I think so . HERFORD ( Suddenly throwing her arms about TOM 'S neck . ) Oh , Tom , I want you to get it ! HERFORD Ann , dear  --  I wish you did n't care so much . You 're preparing yourself for a horrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . I think it 's too late to hear now . p. 66 HERFORD I wo n't listen . It 's silly to give up before you know . RUTH , DAISY , REMINGTON ( Calling from library . ) Come on , Ann  --  we 're waiting . HERFORD Come on  --  and forget this . As your father says , a few others have been lost . Let 's not make a tragedy of it . HERFORD It is n't lost yet . And I wo n't give up till I have to . ( She goes into library . ) HERFORD ( Taking up the paper . ) Go on , Keith . I 'll be in . MCKENZIE Do n't stay out here alone , Governor . Come and get your mind off it . HERFORD Oh , I 'm all right , old man . I 'm ready to lose . Silly to make so much of a thing  --  is n't it ? MCKENZIE I 'm glad you can look at it that way . But do n't give up till you know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , un ? Getting colder now , I think . ( A pause . KEITH watches TOM . He throws down the paper . ) I need the money , Keith . I 've been fool enough to let myself count on it . Fool ! The minute a fellow lets that get hold of him , it knocks out everything else . p. 67 MCKENZIE Of course it does . Get rid of this house , governor . It 's too big a load to carry . Go back to the old way and work for what you started out for . HERFORD I ca n't go back now . I 've got to make money . This thing would set me right  --  lift the debt and make it possible to work for the real thing . MCKENZIE I know . I know . I hope with all my heart you win . HERFORD I 've been trying to bluff it for Ann 's sake , but it 's become an obsession to me . I waken in a cold sweat and think I 've lost and ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in myself . MCKENZIE ( Going to TOM quickly . ) Do n't let anything on earth shake that , Herford . Whether you win or lose , you know you 've got a power that  --  ( TOM shakes KEITH 'S hand and goes up to fire . ) CREEL ( Coming in from library . ) They want you , Tom . ( TOM goes into the library . ) DR . REMINGTON ( Coming into the doorway . ) Are you coming in  --  you two ? CREEL ( Looking from KEITH to REMINGTON . ) No . I  --  p. 68 DR . REMINGTON If you do n't mind I 'll close these doors  --  so you wo n't disturb us . ( He closes the library doors . ) CREEL Tom seems awfully depressed tonight . MCKENZIE Yes , he thinks it 's too late to hear . He thinks he 's lost . CREEL Poor Ann  --  it would nearly kill her . MCKENZIE She 'd have to stand it  --  that would n't matter so much . CREEL But she 's so proud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . MCKENZIE She 'll have plenty to look up to  --  whether he wins or not . CREEL She wants him to be strong and successful . MCKENZIE I suppose you ' d like me to be strong and successful . CREEL I 'd like you to be ambitious . MCKENZIE You 're changed , Ruth . You used to be the gentlest , most feminine thing in the world , perfectly satisfied with me . It 's the damnable work that 's done it . CREEL I began to work because I had to  --  because there was no man to take care of me . And now that I love it  --  now that it 's made life over for me  --  you ask me to throw it all away . p. 69 MCKENZIE But I can take care of you now . CREEL Listen , Keith  --  something 's happened . Last week there was a row in the office over a matter concerning the policy of the magazine and I differed with all the men in my department . At last I was sent for by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was frightened to pieces  --  but I stuck to my guns ; and bless your soul , he sent for me again to-day and said they had had a meeting of the directors and that they had decided  --  Oh , it 's too  --  MCKENZIE What ? CREEL They had decided to put me on the Editorial Staff . ( Fighting down her tears . ) Is n't it funny ? MCKENZIE Did you accept ? CREEL Why , of course . Oh , Keith , do n't you understand what this means to me ? MCKENZIE I understand that unless it means more to you than I do  --  you would n't hesitate a minute to chuck it . CREEL But we 're poor . We ca n't afford to throw away a thing like this . It 's just what I ' ve been working for all these years . Why should I give it up ? MCKENZIE For me . How could you keep house and be away all day ? p. 70 CREEL I could make a home  --  if that 's what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , Keith . MCKENZIE You do n't love me . CREEL If you wo n't let me go on with what could make our life happy together  --  we 'll end it now . I wo n't marry you . MCKENZIE I wo n't give you up , Ruth . You 'll ruin my life . I 've been working for a home all these years . CREEL ( Going towards hall door . ) You ask too much , Keith . I ca n't change myself . MCKENZIE I wo n't give you up . CREEL You must . It 's best  --  for us both . ( She goes out through the hall . KEITH , after staring at the door , goes to the fire . The music in the library stops . ) HERFORD ( Knocking and peeking in through the library door . ) Excuse me . May I come in to get my sewing ? Where 's Ruth ? MCKENZIE ( With his back to DAISY . ) Do n't know . HERFORD Well , do n't bite my head off . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emancipation of women . ( Sitting below table and taking her waist to sew. ) p. 71 MCKENZIE You all think you 're superior beings . HERFORD Of course . MCKENZIE Yes , you do . You 're just as bad as the rest of them  --  worse . The minute a woman makes enough to buy the clothes on her back , she thinks she and God Almighty are running the earth and the men are just little insects crawling around . ( DAISY laughs . ) Oh , you can laugh . It 's so  --  and you know it . Every one of you that has got the bee in your bonnet of doing something  --  doing something , is through with the men . Look at you . You 've cut men out entirely and you think you 're too smart to marry one . Now , do n't you ? Is n't that the reason ? HERFORD Do n't bully-rag me . Say it all to Ruth . MCKENZIE I tell you it 's all rot  --  business for women . It spoils every one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own instead of hustling for your bread and butter ? It 's because you 're too conceited . You think you know more than any man you ever saw and you think you do n't need one . You wait  --  you 'll see  --  some day . HERFORD ( Threading a needle . ) You amuse me . MCKENZIE There you are  --  that 's about what I 'm for . p. 72 HERFORD There 's a button off your coat . Looks horrid . MCKENZIE ( Before the fire . ) I know . I 've got it . ( Putting his finger in waistcoat pocket . ) HERFORD Have you got it there ? ( KEITH shows her the button . ) Come here , I 'll sew it on for you . MCKENZIE Never mind . I 'll nail it on Sunday . HERFORD Come here  --  ( KEITH goes slowly to her . ) You 'll have to take your coat off . It 's bad luck to sew anything on you . MCKENZIE Oh  --  HERFORD Go on  --  take it off  --  ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examines it . ) Good gracious , the lining 's ripped , too . MCKENZIE Yea  --  HERFORD Poor old fellow ! Are these some of your stitches ? ( She laughs . ) MCKENZIE ( Drawing the chair from above table and sitting beside DAISY . ) What 's the matter with ' em ? HERFORD Looks like carpet thread . ( Snipping some threads . ) See , I 'll just draw this together and that 'll be all right . p. 73 MCKENZIE ( After watching her . ) How does it come you 're so handy with a needle ? I thought you were all for business . HERFORD ( Drawing the lamp towards her . ) Well  --  I can sew a button on if you can . MCKENZIE ( Watching her work . ) I tell you it changes all women  --  business . They make a little money themselves and want luxury and wo n't live without it . HERFORD Sometimes  --  yes . But there are lots and lots and lots of women taking care of themselves  --  putting up the bluff of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in a little flat and do their own work  --  just to be the nicest thing in the world to some man . MCKENZIE Would n't you think Ruth would like that better than the office ? HERFORD No  --  not the lamp light and the needle for Ruth . Keith , do n't ask Ruth to give up her work  --  Do n't you see , she 's cleverer in her way than you are in yours ! She 'll go further , and if you make her stop , she 'll hate you some day because she 'll think you 've kept her back . That 's a hard thing to say  --  but it 's the truth . MCKENZIE You mean I 'm a failure . p. 74 HERFORD No  --  no  --  I do n't mean that , Keith . MCKENZIE I work  --  Gosh , how I work ! But I 'll never do anything . Why have n't I got what Mrs. Herford has ? She sent models off for this frieze that any man would be proud to send . Why could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  does n't it ? MCKENZIE You bet it 's unfair . I work like a dog and never get anywhere . If Ruth throws me over , I 'll never have the home I ' m working for . That 's all I want  --  a home . I 'll never have it now . HERFORD Oh , yes , you will . MCKENZIE I 'm done for . HERFORD No , you 're not . There are too many women in the world  --  who  --  could  --  love you . MCKENZIE I 'm no good . HERFORD Some woman might think that your  --  your  --  the way you work  --  and your honesty and loyalty are the greatest things a man can have . MCKENZIE Um ! HERFORD Some woman might use all her cleverness and ingenuity to make the little flat beautiful  --  to show you what your own home  --  could be  --  to give you a better dinner than you thought you could afford . p. 75 MCKENZIE That kind of a woman is a thing of the past . HERFORD Oh , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The trouble is  --  a woman ca n't ask . ( Controlling her voice . ) Even if a man is  --  just at her hand  --  and she knows she could make him happy  --  she ca n't tell him  --  she ca n't open his eyes  --  she has to hide what might make things right for both of them  --  because she 's a woman . MCKENZIE Oh , love does n't cut much ice with a woman . Women are all brain nowadays . HERFORD Brain ? That 's enough to use all the brain a woman 's got  --  to make a home  --  to bring up children  --  and to keep a man 's love . MCKENZIE I never expected to hear you say a thing like that . There 's some excuse for you being in business . HERFORD ( Rising and holding the coat . ) Of course . I ' m not the marrying kind . MCKENZIE ( Getting into the coat . ) Much obliged . ( Turning curiously to DAISY . ) Would you be willing to give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you loved him ? HERFORD ( Trying to laugh . ) You make me laugh . p. 76 MCKENZIE What 's the matter , Daisy ? HERFORD Nothing . MCKENZIE I never saw dew drops in your eyes before . Women are funny things . HERFORD Yes , we 're funny . There 's only one thing on earth funnier . MCKENZIE What ? HERFORD Men . DR . REMINGTON ( Coming in from the library . ) I want the glasses I left in my coat . HERFORD I 'll get them . ( ELLEN comes in from hall . ) DR . REMINGTON No  --  no  --  I will . HERFORD ( As she goes to door . ) I can do it more quickly . ELLEN The telephone , Miss Herford . HERFORD For me ? ELLEN They said any one of the family . HERFORD I 'll go . ( She goes out , followed by ELLEN . ) DR . REMINGTON There 's a woman who knows how to take care of a man . MCKENZIE I 'm afraid that 's not her object in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 77 DR . REMINGTON What 's the matter with you ? MCKENZIE I ' m down and out . DR . REMINGTON Ruth , you mean . MCKENZIE She wo n't marry me unless she goes on working . DR . REMINGTON She 's right , too . MCKENZIE What ? DR . REMINGTON Quite right . MCKENZIE I did n't know you were on that side . DR . REMINGTON I 'm on all sides according to the case . Do n't be a damn fool , Mc-Kenzie . Let Ruth alone . She 's not for you .  --  Open your eyes and look around . There are always other women . MCKENZIE Never  --  never in the world for me ! DR . REMINGTON I give you about three months . MCKENZIE Do you think I could ever  --  DR . REMINGTON Certainly I do . Look at Daisy , for instance . A fine , sweet , wholesome woman with no kinks and no abnormal ambitions  --  MCKENZIE Daisy ? DR . REMINGTON Do n't blow your brains out for a couple of days . Talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finest thing going . p. 78 MCKENZIE What ! DR . REMINGTON Fact ! Do n't try to hold on to the woman who 's getting away from you , but take the one who is coming your way . MCKENZIE You 're crazy . Mad as a hatter . What are you giving me ? DR . REMINGTON Just a little professional advice  --  free . She 's head over heels in love with you , I tell you . HERFORD ( Coming in from hall and speaking in excited whispers . She has a case for glasses in her hand . ) Dr. Remington , that was long distance . They telephoned from school that Millicent has gone . MCKENZIE Gone ? DR . REMINGTON Gone where ? HERFORD Left school suddenly to-night without saying a word to anyone . DR . REMINGTON and MCKENZIE What ? HERFORD As soon as they found it out , they ' phoned the station , and found she had bought a ticket for New York and taken the train . DR . REMINGTON What train ? HERFORD The one that gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nine , now . p. 79 HERFORD Yes  --  too late to go to meet her , and it will take her at least twenty minutes to get to the house . Shall I tell Ann ? DR . REMINGTON No  --  no  --  wait . No use frightening Ann before the child gets here . MCKENZIE Do you think she is coming home ? HERFORD Where else could she go ? Why do you say that , Keith ? What put such an idea into your head ? MCKENZIE If she is coming , why would n't she say so  --  wire or write or something ? HERFORD Oh , it 's too horrible to think of . Doctor , should n't we tell them now ? DR . REMINGTON No  --  no  --  HERFORD But we 're wasting time . What if she should n't come home ? DR . REMINGTON If she does n't come in half an hour , I 'll tell Tom . HERFORD And what can we  --  ( She stops and puts her hand on REMINGTON 'S arm as ANN comes in from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people so wildly keen about playing as you are . What 's the matter with you ? DR . REMINGTON I 've been waiting all this time for my glasses . Come on , Daisy . ( Taking the glasses from DAISY , he goes into library. ) p. 80 HERFORD You look worried , Daisy . HERFORD Why , I 'm only  --  ELLEN ( Coming in from hall with eight letters on a small silver tray . ) The mail , Mrs. Herford . HERFORD Oh ! ( Rushing to meet ELLEN , she snatches the letters , taking off the three top ones . ) Oh  --  it 's come . It 's come ! Tom 's letter . KEITH AND DAISY ( Going to her . ) What ? ( ELLEN goes out through hall . ) HERFORD It is ! It is  --  as true as I live . MCKENZIE Great Scott ! HERFORD Then he 's got it . He 's got it . HERFORD Sh ! Ask him to come here . HERFORD ( Going to library . ) It 's too good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes in . ) MCKENZIE ( Shaking ANN 'S hand . ) I ca n't tell you how glad I am , Mrs. Herford . I ca n't tell you . HERFORD ( Scarcely able to speak . ) Do n't tell him . Ask him to come here . p. 81 MCKENZIE ( Going in . ) Mrs. Herford wants you , governor . HERFORD ( Within . ) Come and play , Ann . HERFORD ( Throwing the other letters on the table . ) Come here just a minute , Tom , please . HERFORD ( Coming to door . ) What is it ? HERFORD Shut the door . HERFORD What 's the matter ? HERFORD Come here . Look  --  ( Showing the letter . ) It 's come ! HERFORD ( Snatching the letter . ) By Jove ! ( He tears it open and reads . She watches him . A look of sickening disappointment and agony comes into his face . ) HERFORD No ? Oh , Tom  --  ( He walks away . ) Do n't take it like that . HERFORD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom , do n't take it that way . It 's all  --  experience  --  all in the day 's work , dear . What difference does it make , after all ? You know you did a big thing . It 's all luck  --  anyway . p. 82 HERFORD ( Sitting on lower end of couch . ) I 'll pull up in a minute  --  Well , it means taking hold of something else  --  pretty quick . Going at it again . HERFORD ( Going to stand near his arm . ) Yes , keeping at it  --  that 's it . What a terrible lot chance has to do with it . HERFORD Oh , no  --  that is n't it . HERFORD Yes it is , too . HERFORD No  --  I failed . I did n't get it . That 's all . ( ANN sits close to him . ) HERFORD You 'll do something greater  --  next time  --  because of this . HERFORD ( Taking her hand without looking at her . ) You 're a brick . Now see here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not the end of all things . Stop that ! You 're not crying , I hope . HERFORD No  --  I 'm not . Of course I 'm not . Oh , my boy  --  I never loved you so much  --  never believed in you as I do now . This is only a little hard place that will make you all the stronger . HERFORD Dear old girl ! What would I do without you ? Come on  --  buck up now  --  ( Rising and crossing to the right . ) We must tell  --  ( He stops , staring at a letter on the table. ) p. 83 HERFORD What 's the matter ? HERFORD ( Snatching the latter . ) Ann  --  here 's a letter for you , too . HERFORD ( Rising . ) What ! Open it . ( He tears open the letter , and gives it to her . ) HERFORD ( Reading and staring at the letter . ) It ca n't be . It ca n't be ! It is ! They ' ve given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Is that what it says  --  is it ? It ca n't be ! It ca n't be true ! It 's the most wonderful  --  Hold me , Tom . Hold me tight . I never was so happy in my life .

We have the money .  --  You have n't lost . Oh , Tom , it 's too good to be true . Say you 're glad , dear . Say you 're proud of me . That 's the best part of all . HERFORD I am , dear  --  very  --  very glad  --  for you . HERFORD Oh , Tom , I wanted you to get it more than I ever wanted anything in my life  --  but this is something to be thankful for . Does n't this almost make it all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ann . HERFORD Does n't this almost take away the disappointment ? HERFORD Yes , dear  --  yes . Do n't think of me . That 's over  --  that part of it . Tell the others now  --  are n't you going to ? HERFORD I only want to be sure that you 're just as happy that I won as I would have been if you had . HERFORD Of course I am . You know that . HERFORD ( Kissing him quickly . ) You darling ! Tell the others , then , Tom . I ca n't . HERFORD ( Going to open the library doors . ) What do you think has happened ? HERFORD Tom got it . Did n't you , Tom ? You did ! You did ! Oh , I 'm so glad . Oh , I ' m so glad . It 's too  --  MCKENZIE ( Coming in . ) How is it ? DR . REMINGTON ( In the doorway . ) Well  --  how is it ? HERFORD You tell them , Tom . HERFORD ( After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) p. 85 HERFORD What ? HERFORD ( Very kindly . ) Is n't it great ? HERFORD ( To DAISY and DR . REMINGTON . ) You wo n't believe it , but you can see the letter . It is true  --  is n't it , Tom ? ( To DR . REMINGTON . ) Now , father , do n't you think getting that is better than being nursemaid or housekeeper ? Now do n't you honestly ? DR . REMINGTON I do not . HERFORD What ? DR . REMINGTON I do not . HERFORD Oh , I can laugh at your theories now . You have n't a leg to stand on . Has he , Tom ? ( Going to DR . REMINGTON . ) Be a dear father and say you 're glad . DR . REMINGTON It 's ridiculous . ( He says this so harshly that ANN starts  --  the others look at him in surprise . ) It 's ridiculous , I say . I 'd rather you 'd failed a thousand times over  --  for your own good . HERFORD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so hard and narrow , father ? DR . REMINGTON Hard and narrow be hanged ! I ' m an old man . I know women better than you know yourselves . Who cares a hang whether you make statues or write books ? The men beat you at it anyway . They cook your food and make your own hats and dresses better than you do your-selves . But the one thing we can not do is to bear children and take care of them . Why in God 's name do n't you women stick to your own job and make it a success ? No  --  I 'm not proud of you . I wish you 'd failed for your own sake . You ' ve interfered with your husband 's business . p. 86 HERFORD Oh . DR . REMINGTON I said you ' d raise merry hell , and you have . HERFORD I do n't know what you mean . HERFORD Oh , Doctor , you 're excited . DR . REMINGTON Not a bit . I ' m only telling you the truth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept your business in your own hands you 'd have got this thing yourself and been the head of your own house . HERFORD I do n't see the argument . Ann got it because she sent in a better model than I did . I do n't see that anything else has anything to do with the case . ( He goes out through hall . ) HERFORD At least Tom is glad I got it . DR . REMINGTON He 's stung to the quick . You 've humiliated him in his own eyes . ( He goes into the library , leaving the doors open , where he is still seen walking up and down . ) HERFORD ( Sitting by the table . ) I ca n't understand why father feels this way about it . HERFORD Oh  --  it 's natural enough . HERFORD Are n't you glad for me  --  Daisy ? p. 87 HERFORD Yes , but  --  I  --  I 'm awfully sorry for Tom . ( She goes out through hall . ) HERFORD What 's the matter with them all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's natural , Mrs. Herford . ( He goes out through the hall  --  closing the door . ANN , hurt , amazed , controls her tears . ) DR . REMINGTON ( Coming back from library . ) Ann , I ' m afraid I was a little too stiff just now . I did n't mean to be nasty . HERFORD Oh , it does n't matter . DR . REMINGTON Yes it does matter . I would n't hurt you for the world . HERFORD But you ' ve always fought me , father . You ' ve never thought I had any right to work  --  never believed I had any ability . Now that I 've proved I have  --  why ca n't you acknowledge it ? DR . REMINGTON Ann , this is a dangerous moment in your life . Tom 's beaten  --  humiliated  --  knocked out . You did it  --  he ca n't stand it . HERFORD No  --  no  --  what have I done ? I 've been given this commission  --  I offered the idea to Tom . DR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-night that no man on earth could stand . p. 88 HERFORD No , no  --  not Tom . I wo n't believe it . DR . REMINGTON Yes , I say . I know what I 'm talking about . Be careful how you move now . Use your woman 's tact  --  your love . Make Tom know that he is the greatest thing in the world to you  --  that you 'd even give up all this work  --  idea  --  if  --  he wanted  --  you to . HERFORD What ? Tom would n't let me . DR . REMINGTON Ask him . Ask him . See what he 'd say . HERFORD Why , I would n't insult him . He ' d think I thought he was  --  ( TOM comes in from the hall . ANN checks herself and turns away quickly . ) HERFORD ( After a pause . ) What 's the matter ? DR . REMINGTON Nothing  --  nothing . Ann and I were just having a little argument as usual . I ' m going to smoke another cigar now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing the doors . ) HERFORD I hope you 're not still fighting about the  --  your frieze ? HERFORD They 're all so funny , Tom  --  the way they act about it . It hurts . But so long as you 're glad it does n't matter what anyone else thinks . Say you 're glad , dear . I want you to be as happy as I would be if you had won . p. 89 HERFORD You know I am , dear . You know that . HERFORD Ah . ( She kisses him quickly with a sigh of relief . ) There 's just barely two years to do it in.  --  That means I 'll have to work every minute and not even go to the country in the summer . HERFORD And what will you do with Millicent in the summer ? HERFORD Oh , there are lots of nice things for her to do . There are such splendid summer camps for girls where they simply live out of doors  --  and have beautiful care . Oh , Tom , the money ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me tell you one thing , Ann , in the beginning . I 'll never touch a penny of the money . HERFORD What ? HERFORD Not a cent of it . HERFORD What are you talking about ? HERFORD That 's your money . Put it away for yourself . HERFORD I never heard you say anything so absolutely unreasonable before in my life . HERFORD If you think I 'm unreasonable , all right . But that 's understood about the money . We wo n't discuss it . HERFORD Well , we will discuss it . Why should n't you use my money as well as I yours ? p. 90 HERFORD That 's about as different as day and night . HERFORD Why is it ? HERFORD Because I 'm taking care of you . It 's all right if you never do another day 's work in your life . You 're doing it because you want to . I ' m doing it because I ' ve got to . If you were alone it would be a different thing . But I am here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what keeps us going . HERFORD But I 'll help you . HERFORD No you wo n't . HERFORD I will . I 'm going on just as far as I have ability to go , and if you refuse to take any money I make  --  if you refuse to use it for our mutual good , you 're unjust and taking an unfair advantage . Oh , Tom ! what are we saying ? How did this happen ? We 're out of our senses  --  both of us . You did n't mean what you said . Did you ? It would  --  I simply could n't bear it if you did . You did n't  --  did you ? HERFORD I did  --  of course . HERFORD Tom  --  after all these years of pulling together , now that I ' ve done something , why do you suddenly balk ? HERFORD Good heavens ! Do you think I 'm going to use your money ? Do n't try to run my end of it . p. 91 HERFORD Is n't it a good thing for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know that it is . I do n't know that it 's a good thing from any standpoint to have it known that I failed , but my wife succeeded . ( Starting to hall door . ) I 'm beginning to hate this work and everything in connection with it . HERFORD But you taught me  --  helped me  --  pushed me on . What 's changed you ? HERFORD I let you do it in the first place because I thought it was right  --  I wanted you to do the thing you wanted to do . HERFORD Well ? HERFORD I was a fool . I did n't see what it would lead to ! It 's taking you away from everything else  --  and there 'll be no end to it . Your ambition will carry you away till the home and Millicent and I are nothing to you ! HERFORD Tom , do n't you know that you and Millicent come before everything on earth to me ? HERFORD They do n't now . HERFORD ( Going close to him . ) Tom  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Be honest . Are you  --  sorry  --  I got this commission ? HERFORD I 'm sorry it 's the most important thing in the world to you . p. 92 HERFORD Oh ! Why do you say that to me ? How can you ? HERFORD Have n't I just seen it ? You 're getting rid of Millicent now because you do n't want her to interfere with your work . HERFORD No ! HERFORD ( Not stopping . ) You 're pushing her out of your life . HERFORD No ! HERFORD You said just now you were going to send her away alone in the summer . I do n't like that . She 's got to be with you  --  I want you to keep her with you . HERFORD But that 's impossible . You know that . If I stop work now I might as well give up the frieze entirely . HERFORD Then give it up . HERFORD What ? HERFORD Give up the whole thing  --  forever . Why should n't you ? HERFORD Do you mean that ? HERFORD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Do n't ask this sacrifice of me to prove my love . HERFORD Could you make it  --  could you ? HERFORD Do n't ask it ! Do n't ask it for your own sake . I want to keep on loving you . I want to believe you 're what I thought you . Do n't make me think you 're just like every other man . p. 93 HERFORD I am a man  --  and you 're my wife and Millicent 's our daughter . Unless you come back to the things a woman 's always had to do  --  and always will  --  we ca n't go on . We ca n't go on . HERFORD Tom  --  if you 're just a little hurt , just a little jealous because I won  --  HERFORD Oh  --  HERFORD That 's natural  --  I can understand that  --  HERFORD Oh , do n't  --  HERFORD But , oh , Tom , the other  --  to ask me to give it all up . I could never forgive that . Take it back , Tom  --  take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Do n't you know what it all means ? You 're a woman and I ' m a man . You 're not free in the same way . If you wo n't stop because I ask it  --  I say you must ! HERFORD You ca n't say that to me . You ca n't ! HERFORD I do say it . HERFORD No ! HERFORD I say it because I know it 's right . HERFORD It is n't . HERFORD I ca n't make you see it . HERFORD It isn't. p. 94 HERFORD I do n't know how  --  but everything in me tells me it 's right . HERFORD Tom  --  listen to me  --  HERFORD If you wo n't do it because I ask you  --  I demand it . I say you ' ve got to . HERFORD You kill my love  --  HERFORD Then this is the biggest thing in the world to you ? HERFORD What is more important to us both  --  to our happiness ? ( The door opens and MILLICENT comes into the room . There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MILLICENT I came home , mother . HERFORD Why ? MILLICENT Because I had to . HERFORD Are you ill , dear ? MILLICENT No  --  but I wo n't go back to school . HERFORD Why ? You will go back to-morrow . MILLICENT I wo n't , mother . HERFORD Millicent ! MILLICENT ( Beginning to sob . ) I wo n't ! I wo n't ! I wo n't go back and you ca n't make me. p. 95 HERFORD Is there anything wrong ? MILLICENT No  --  no  --  I tell you  --  no . ( She turns and rushes out of the room and TOM and ANN stare at each other as the curtain falls. ) @x The scene is the same as in Act Second , but half an hour has passed . RUTH is writing at the desk . After a moment DAISY comes in from the hall . ) CREEL Where is Millicent ? HERFORD I ' ve just tucked her into bed . CREEL Have you found out why she came ? HERFORD No  --  but she did n't run away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send her right back , of course . HERFORD I do n't know whether she will or not . Millicent seems to have some very positive ideas of her own on the subject . CREEL It 's awful for Ann to be upset at this time of all others , when she 's got to begin this gigantic work . HERFORD Oh , I wish the darned frieze were in Guinea  --  and that Ann had nothing to do but to take care of Tom and Millicent like any ordinary woman . I ' d give any-thing if she had n't won the competition . CREEL Daisy ! HERFORD I would . I have a ghastly feeling that something horrible is going to come of it . If it has n't already come . p. 97 CREEL What do you mean ? HERFORD I tell you it is not possible for a man and woman to love each other and live together and be happy unless the man is it . CREEL Ye gods ! Speaking of the dark ages ! You ought to live in a harem ! In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrong pigeon hole altogether . HERFORD Why ? CREEL You ' d make such a good wife . HERFORD Thank you ! CREEL So much better than most women  --  than I would , for instance HERFORD Do n't waste your time analysing me , Ruth . You 're way off . CREEL You 're so self reliant , men are sort of afraid of you  --  do n't appreciate you . Now a man like Keith  --  HERFORD What has Keith to do with the case ? ( REMINGTON comes in from the hall . ) DR . REMINGTON Am I in the wrong camp ? CREEL and HERFORD No  --  No . Come in . DR . REMINGTON I have to stay some place . I 'm going to hang around till Millicent quiets down . p. 98 HERFORD Is she ill ? DR . REMINGTON Oh , no  --  just a little worked up and excited . CREEL Why do you think she came home , Dr. Remington ? DR . REMINGTON I do n't know what to think ,  --  unless she has boy in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DR . REMINGTON She 's sixteen . You ca n't choke it off to save your life . CREEL Oh , she 's a baby . DR . REMINGTON Do n't fool yourself . I bet you she wo n't wait as long as you two have to fall head over heels in love and be married and sit by her own fireside with children playing at her knee . CREEL Oh , heavens ! DR . REMINGTON That 's the only thing in the whole game that 's worth a cent anyway . ( KEITH comes in from hall . ) Is n't that so , Keith ? MCKENZIE What ? DR . REMINGTON I 've just been telling these two girls that children are the only  --  CREEL I must go and see if I can do anything for Ann . HERFORD No , I 'll go . p. 99 CREEL ( Hurrying to hall door . ) No  --  no  --  I 'll go . DR . REMINGTON Let me go . ( RUTH goes out . ) They both seem terribly anxious to get out when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way . I 'll go . ( Starting towards library . ) HERFORD No  --  do n't be silly . Do n't go . DR . REMINGTON ( Turning at library door . ) Oh  --  by the way , Keith  --  I always take a run into the country in the car on Sundays . Come along to-morrow  --  and bring  --  either Ruth or Daisy . Take your choice  --  I know which one I 'd take . ( He goes out through hall . ) HERFORD Is n't he a goose ! MCKENZIE Would it bore you to go , Daisy ? HERFORD Nonsense ! Ruth will go . MCKENZIE I do n't think she will . It would be awfully good of you . Tomorrow 's going to be a hard day for me to get through . Ruth told me to-night that she  --  I 'm afraid it 's all over . HERFORD Oh , no . She did n't mean it . She thinks you 'll give in . MCKENZIE Un ! She does n't know how strong I am. p. 100 HERFORD Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compromise about . She 's all wrong . HERFORD She sees it from her side . MCKENZIE But her side is impossible . Now do n't you think I 'm right ? HERFORD Oh , do n't ask me . I do n't know anything about it . ( Starting to hall door . ) MCKENZIE Well , wait a minute . I  --  wo n't you go to-morrow , Daisy ? HERFORD Ask Ruth . It will be a good chance to make up . MCKENZIE I ca n't grovel in the dirt , you know . She 's very hard . Very difficult to change . She only sees it one way . Would n't you like to go , Daisy ? Of course  --  you 're so practical and like such different things  --  I do n't quite know , maybe you 'd think flying along through the country and lunching at some nice little out-of-the-way place was too frivolous  --  HERFORD Oh , yes  --  I do n't like anything but being shut up in the house all day , pounding at my typewriter and splitting my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off with a man  --  for a whole day  --  and have a little fun  --  like any other woman  --  would be too unheard of . Of course I could n't do anything as silly as that . p. 101 MCKENZIE Oh , now  --  HERFORD I would n't be amusing anyway . Dr. Remington , well , he 's sixty  --  and you 'd be thinking of Ruth and I 'd sit there like a stick  --  the sensible , practical , dignified woman who could n't possibly be interesting and fascinating because no man could possibly take the trouble to find out how devilish and alluring and altogether exciting I might be if I had the chance . ( She throws open the door and goes out . KEITH stares after her . ) HERFORD ( Coming in after a moment . ) I thought you 'd gone , McKenzie . MCKENZIE No  --  but I ' m going  --  ( TOM goes to fire . KEITH hesitates . and goes to him . ) Governor  --  I know you 're glad Mrs. Herford got it  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you did n't . HERFORD Oh , that 's all right , old man . MCKENZIE I know what you 're going through . It 's hell  --  that 's what it is  --  hell . If women keep on like this , what 's going to become of us ? HERFORD ( Sitting before fire . ) Well  --  they 've got a right to live their own lives as they want to  --  as much right as we have . The old things do n't satisfy them any more . p. 102 MCKENZIE Thank God , there are still some women to whom love is enough . Why one of the strongest , most independent personalities I know is a woman who ' d be willing to marry a poor man and keep house for him and not think she was missing anything . And she 's one of the strongest personalities I know . Why , she is great . She says  --  DR . REMINGTON ( Coming in to the open hall door . ) Who 's this that 's so great ? MCKENZIE Oh  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuse me . MCKENZIE That 's all right . I must go . DR . REMINGTON and HERFORD Good night , McKenzie . Good night . DR . REMINGTON I 'll dig you up in the morning , ten o'clock . Sharp mind . And I 'll call for Daisy first . MCKENZIE ( At hall door . ) All right . Much obliged , Doctor . ( Turning back . ) How 'd you know it was Daisy ? DR . REMINGTON I did n't  --  but I do now . MCKENZIE Good night . ( He goes out . ) HERFORD ( Going to fire . ) Well  --  how is she ? How is Millicent ? p. 103 DR . REMINGTON Oh , she 's not sick  --  But the child 's nervous as a witch  --  all strung up . She 's worried about something  --  got something on her mind and naturally her head aches and she has a little fever  --  but that wo n't hurt her . HERFORD Got something on her mind ? What ? DR . REMINGTON ( Walking up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HERFORD What could she have on her mind ? DR . REMINGTON I do n't think she 's committed murder  --  but she 's got a mind , you know  --  There 's no reason why she should n't have something on it . HERFORD Well , I do n't know what to do with her . DR . REMINGTON You do n't need to  --  that 's not your job . HERFORD Ann says she must go back to school . DR . REMINGTON I do n't advise that  --  You better persuade Ann that 's not the best thing . HERFORD Persuade Ann ? I 'll do nothing of the kind . If you think Millicent ought n't to go back to school , you tell Ann so  --  tell her those are your orders . DR . REMINGTON Oh , I could n't do that , my boy . You tell her those are your orders  --  un ? p. 104 HERFORD I do n't give orders to Ann . DR . REMINGTON The devil you do n't ! Why do n't you then ? She likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walnut tree  --  the more you beat ' em the better they be . HERFORD Yes , the walnut tree business does n't work with Ann . DR . REMINGTON Oh , yes it does  --  like a charm  --  you do n't use it  --  that 's the trouble . That 's your fault  --  not hers . The more spirit a woman has the more she likes a master . HERFORD Rot ! DR . REMINGTON Ann 's a strong woman , but she expects you to be stronger than she is . She expects it , mind you . HERFORD I 'll never even ask Ann again to do a thing she does n't want to do  --  much less tell her she 's got to  --  never as long as I live . DR . REMINGTON Let me tell you something , my boy  --  of all the women I ever knew , Ann respects firmness in other people the most . Did it never occur to you that she does n't expect you to give up ! that she just takes the bit in her teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her by being weak . HERFORD Disappoint nothing ! I 've made a fool of myself to-night by telling her I would n't touch the money she gets out of this thing  --  she does n't understand . p. 105 DR . REMINGTON She understands you meant what you said , does n't she ? HERFORD Oh , that is n't it . She  --  I  --  I made a mess of it . She thinks I  --  I made her think I 'm  --  well  --  I went at it the wrong way . I said things that sounded all wrong . I 'm not a rotter  --  but I 've made her think  --  well , it looks like  --  I 've made her think I 'm jealous because she got this thing . DR . REMINGTON Well  --  are n't you ? HERFORD What ? Do you all think that ? DR . REMINGTON Why should n't you be jealous ? HERFORD Not on your life I 'm not . I 'm not such a skunk as that  --  to let her help me for years and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell you it 's something else . Something hit me all of a heap tonight when I opened that letter and saw that she got it . Something sort of gave way under my feet  --  DR . REMINGTON Of course  --  HERFORD No , not of course at all  --  it was strange . It was a new thing . I could n't get a grip on myself  --  I tried to  --  but I could n't . Instead of saying , " Ann , you 've done a big thing  --  big for any man and I ' m proud of it , "  --  I  --  I could n't say it  --  a nasty feeling got me  --  and I said things that made me look  --  I saw it in her face  --  the amazement  --  the disgust and the disappointment  --  but I could n't stop . And now you  --  they all think it . It 's a tremendous thing she 's done  --  Nobody knows that as well as I do . She 's got something in her that I have n't  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing will make her . p. 106 DR . REMINGTON Oh , nonsense  --  do n't exaggerate . She 's got genius in certain directions , yes  --  but she has n't got your constructive strength  --  your knowledge  --  your power . This one thing she did is not going to set the world on fire . HERFORD I do n't know where it will carry her . I do n't want to drag her back . But when I think of it  --  something gets me here .  --  ( Touching his heart . ) She seems gone  --  somehow  --  gone away from me . Doctor , for the Lord 's sake do n't think I ' m mean  --  it 's something else , I tell you . I ca n't explain it  --  if she were a man  --  if another man had got it  --  I 'd take my licking without whining and as I looked at her to-night I wished she were a man so I could hit her on the back and say , " Well , by golly you 're all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you what it is , Doctor  --  I love her so that I  --  I  --  DR . REMINGTON You do n't need to tell me that . HERFORD But it 's a funny thing  --  as she 's worked there with me in the studio all these years  --  coming and going in her pretty little dresses  --  clever as hell and not afraid of anything ; so game  --  such a good pal and making headway like a steam engine  --  much as I loved to have her there at my elbow  --  sometimes when it came time to stop work  --  sometimes I 've wished I had n't seen her all day that I had her to go home to  --  that I could see her for the first time fresh and rested and waiting for me and that I was running the machine alone for her  --  ( His voice breaks and he turns away . ) It is n't ordinary jealousy  --  I do n't know what it is . She 'll never understand  --  I 've knocked the whole business in the head now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . p. 107 DR . REMINGTON When I say you 're jealous  --  HERFORD Oh , do n't ! DR . REMINGTON Yes , I will , too . When I say you 're jealous , I only mean the natural instincts of the man have broken out . You 've been trying to hide ' em for years , and it took this thing to wake ' em up . HERFORD Oh  --  DR . REMINGTON The natural male instincts  --  I say , of protecting the female  --  of building her house and keeping her in it . HERFORD I ' m afraid your arguments all date back to about the time of Noah 's Ark , doctor . DR . REMINGTON You and Noah and all the rest of us are just the same . We cover it up and fool ourselves but when the crisis comes we get up and fight with all the barbaric fight in us . Go on  --  fight for your right  --  for your place  --  you want to keep her  --  you want her for your wife  --  not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stubborn  --  it 's only your weakness she 'll despise . Keep her  --  keep her for your sake  --  for the girl 's sake  --  and for her own sake . Her own sake  --  I tell you  --  for in the long run where 's her own happiness going to be ? HERFORD ( Coming in and speaking , after a pause . ) Well , father  --  what do you say about Millicent ? ( ANN sits on left side of couch. ) p. 108 DR . REMINGTON Oh , she  --  well , she 's run down . She needs rest . HERFORD Seriously ? DR . REMINGTON Oh no  --  not seriously  --  but my advice is that you let her stay at home for awhile . HERFORD Nonsense ! This is only a caprice  --  and it would be the worst thing in the world to give in to her . Unless you say  --  as a physician  --  that she 's too in to  --  DR . REMINGTON I do n't say she 's too ill  --  physically . You must decide for yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while and if she is n't asleep I 'll give her a mild sleeping powder . ( He goes to the door and turns . ) Ann , I put her in your arms first  --  and the look that came into your face then was as near divinity as we ever get . Oh , my daughter  --  do n't let the new restlessness and strife of the world about you blind you to the old things  --  the real things . ( He goes out . ) HERFORD ( After a moment . ) She absolutely refuses to tell me why she ran away from school . I said I 'd go up to her again in half an hour , and if she wo n't tell me then  --  she must go back to-morrow , whether she wants to or not . ( A pause ; she looks at TOM . ) You agree with me , do n't you  --  that it 's the only thing to do . p. 109 HERFORD I could n't possibly know as well as you do what you want  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What you want  --  regardless of anything or anybody else . HERFORD ( Rising . ) I am , until somebody can give me a reason  --  a good reason why I should do something else . What you said to me to-night has nothing in it but  --  HERFORD Nothing in it but what you see in it . HERFORD You 've given me nothing to see but a sudden change from all you 've said you believed  --  all we 've lived for  --  worked for . Nothing  --  nothing that could ever come to me could be so hard  --  so bitter a disappointment as the  --  the things you said to-night . It is n't so much what you said as what it means  --  the horrible emptiness it leaves . It changes the whole world . Nothing  --  that can ever come to me can be so hard . Nothing . MILLICENT ( Opening the door . ) Mother , are n't you coming back ? ( MILLICENT wears a soft robe over her night gown . Her hair hangs loose . ) HERFORD Millicent  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't sleep . HERFORD Run back  --  quickly . p. 110 MILLICENT ( Running to throw herself on the couch and tucking her feet up . ) In a minute . I want to stay down here just a few minutes . It 's so quiet upstairs I could n't sleep . I 'm used to the girls . HERFORD You 'll catch cold . MILLICENT Goodness , mother , I 'm roasting . HERFORD Millicent !  --  What shall I do with you ? MILLICENT Is that what you and dad were talking about ? What did Grandfather say ? I do n't care what he says , I ' m not going back to school . You 're on my side  --  are n't you , dad ? HERFORD Whatever your mother says is right , of course . MILLICENT Why do you give up to mother so ? Mother , is it true  --  what Daisy told me  --  that you got the contract for a big frieze and not father ? Is it ? Is it , father ? ( Looking from one to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HERFORD Millicent , go to bed . MILLICENT I think that 's perfectly horrid , mother . How funny ! Why should they give it to you ? I think father ought to have it  --  he 's the man . Do n't you think people will think it 's funny that you did n't get it , father ? I should think it would make people lose confidence in you . ( A pause . TOM stalks out  --  closing the door . ) Is father hurt because you got it ? I should think he would be . p. 111 HERFORD Millicent , I 've had quite enough of this . Go up to bed at once . MILLICENT Will you come and sleep with me ? HERFORD Of course not . MILLICENT Why not ? HERFORD Neither one of us would sleep a wink . MILLICENT That would n't matter . I do n't want to be alone . HERFORD Come now  --  I ca n't wait  --  I wo n't speak to you again . MILLICENT What have you decided about the school ? HERFORD I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go up till you tell me . HERFORD Millicent  --  you will go at once , I say . MILLICENT Oh , mother , do n't be cross . ( Reaching a hand up to her mother 's arm . ) Sit down and talk a minute . HERFORD It 's late . You must  --  MILLICENT That 's nothing . We girls often talk till twelve . HERFORD Till twelve ? Do the teachers know it ? MILLICENT ( Laughing again . ) Oh , mother , you 're lovely ! Do the teachers know it ? Why , do n't you suppose they know that they do n't know everything that 's going on ? They 're pretty wise guys those ladies  --  they know when to let you alone . That 's why the school 's so popular . Come and sit down , mother . p. 112 HERFORD No ! You must go to bed . MILLICENT But I wo n't go back to school . HERFORD You make it terribly hard for me , Millicent . You do n't know what 's good for you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I do expect you to be obedient . MILLICENT But , mother , I tell you  --  HERFORD Do n't be so rebellious . Now come upstairs , please , dear , and  --  MILLICENT But I wo n't go back to school , mother , dear . I wo n't . HERFORD I 'm tired of this . You say I treat you like a child . You force me to . If you do n't want me to punish you  --  go upstairs at once and say nothing more about not going back to school . MILLICENT I wo n't go back . HERFORD Stop , I say ! MILLICENT I know what I want to do . I 'm sixteen . HERFORD ( Their voices rising together . ) You 're my child . You will obey me . MILLICENT But I wo n't ! You do n't understand . I ca n't , mother . I 'm going to be married . ( A pause . ANN takes her hands away quickly and stares at MILLICENT. ) p. 113 HERFORD You silly child ! MILLICENT It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't say a thing like that even in fun . MILLICENT It 's the truth , I tell you . I 'm going to be married . HERFORD Some time you are , of course  --  you mean . MILLICENT No  --  now  --  soon . That 's why I left . That 's why I 'm not going back . I know what I want and I ' m going to be married . HERFORD ( After drawing the chair from the table to the couch and sitting beside MILLICENT . ) What do you mean ? MILLICENT I  --  he  --  we  --  we 're engaged  --  we 're going to be married . That 's why I came home . HERFORD He  --  who ? MILLICENT You  --  you do n't know him . HERFORD ( Scarcely able to speak . ) Who ? MILLICENT He 's  --  he 's perfectly wonderful . HERFORD Who is he ? MILLICENT Now , mother , wait . He  --  he is n't rich  --  HERFORD Well  --  p. 114 MILLICENT He 's poor  --  but he 's perfectly wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HERFORD ( Quietly . ) What does he do ? MILLICENT He  --  he  --  Oh , mother , it 's hard to explain because he 's so different  --  HERFORD What does he do ? MILLICENT Well  --  just now he  --  he drives the motor at school  --  because you see he 's so proud he  --  HERFORD Drives the motor ?  --  A chauffeur , you mean ? MILLICENT People call him that , of course  --  but he is n't  --  ( ANN rises . ) Mother  --  ( ANN goes to the door and locks it  --  goes back to MILLICENT , who has risen . ) Now , mother , do n't look like that . HERFORD Sit down . MILLICENT Do n't look like that . Let me tell you about it . HERFORD Yes , tell me about it . MILLICENT Oh , I  --  hardly know how to begin . HERFORD He runs the motor  --  the school motor , you say ? MILLICENT Yes  --  to the trains , you know  --  and into town and to church . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father ? Why  --  I  --  I do n't know who he is . I 've never met his father . HERFORD What is his name ? MILLICENT His father 's name ? I do n't know . HERFORD What is the boy 's name ? MILLICENT Willie Kern . HERFORD How does he happen to run a motor ? MILLICENT Well , I do n't know just how it happened  --  he 's so clever , you know , and of course he is n't really a chauffeur at all . HERFORD What is he then ? MILLICENT Oh , mother ! He just happens to run the school motor . HERFORD And what did he do before that ? MILLICENT Why he  --  he ran another motor . Oh , now , mother , you do n't understand at all . ( She breaks into sobs and throws herself full length on the couch . ANN sits rigidly . ) Just because he 's poor and clever and drives a motor is no reason why you should act this way . ( Sitting up . ) He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to New York to get a different position . And we 're going to be married as soon as he gets his position , and that 's why I came home  --  to tell you . So there . So you see I ca n't go back to school . ( She rises and starts to the door. ) p. 116 HERFORD Millicent ! Come back here . MILLICENT That 's all there is to tell . I 'm going to bed now . HERFORD ( Rising . ) You know this is the most wild and impossible thing in the world . MILLICENT I do n't . It is n't impossible . I 'm going to marry him . I love him better than you or father or anybody in the world and I ' m going to marry him . HERFORD Stop ! Do you want to disgrace us ? You have disgraced us . How any child of mine could speak  --  even speak to such a person ! How is it possible that a girl brought up as you 've been  --  I ca n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll  --  I do n't know what he 'll do to you . Oh , the disappointment ! The disgrace ! Where 's your pride ? How could you ? How could you ? Millicent  --  if you 'll promise me to give this up I wo n't say a word to your father . MILLICENT No  --  no  --  I ' m going . HERFORD Do n't unlock that door . MILLICENT I want to go now . HERFORD You will never see this boy again . Never speak to him  --  never write to him  --  never hear of him . I shall send you away where he 'll never know  --  p. 117 MILLICENT ( Turning back to her mother . ) You wo n't ! He loves me ! I love him ! He understands me . All that vacation when you would n't let me come home and all the other girls had gone he was just as good to me as he could be . Miss Laurence let me go in town for the mail every day  --  for the ride . HERFORD Alone with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you see  --  she just thinks of him as the chauffeur . He is n't at all , you know . He 's perfectly wonderful . He knew how lonely I was and he  --  we got engaged that vacation . You would n't let me come home . HERFORD Millicent  --  my darling  --  you do n't know what you 're saying . ( Taking MILLICENT back to the couch . ) You  --  you  --  do n't know  --  what you 're doing . MILLICENT Oh , yes , I do , mother . It 's you that do n't know . You do n't understand . HERFORD ( Kneeling before MILLICENT . ) Oh , Millicent  --  my darling  --  why  --  did n't you tell me this , when you said you wanted to come home ? Why did n't you tell me this ? ( Sobbing , ANN buries her face in MILLICENT 's lap . ) MILLICENT ( Not touching her mother . ) I would have told you  --  if you 'd let me come home  --  but you would n't  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we  --  we got engaged . You do n't understand , mother . p. 118 HERFORD ( Lifting her face to MILLICENT 'S and caressing her arms . ) Oh , yes , I do , dear . Yes , I do . I understand . Tell me  --  all about it , dearest . How did it happen ? When did you first know him ? How did you  --  happen to speak to him  --  I mean how did you happen to  --  love him ? MILLICENT Oh , mother  --  why I  --  he  --  I just did  --  he 's so handsome and so nice . You have n't any idea how nice he is , mother ! HERFORD ( Moving closer to MILLICENT . ) Have n't I , dear ? Tell me . Why is he so nice ? What is he like ? Tell me everything , dear . How did it begin ? MILLICENT He  --  the first time I really knew he was different , you know  --  HERFORD Yes , dear  --  MILLICENT Was one Sunday morning I was ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the motor and ran down the steps and fell and he jumped out and picked me up and put me in the motor , and of course I thanked him and we had to wait quite a while for the others , and I found out how different and how really wonderful he was . All the girls are crazy about him . Here 's his picture . ( Drawing out a locket which is on a chain around her neck . ) It 's just a little snapshot I took myself one morning  --  and you ca n't really tell from this how awfully good looking he is . ( ANN takes the locket and looks closely at the picture . ) His eyes are the most wonderful , and his lashes are the longest I ever saw . You ca n't see his teeth and they are  --  well , you 'd just love his teeth , mother . p. 119 HERFORD ( Letting her head sink against MILLICENT . ) Would I , dear ? Have you seen very much of him ? Have you seen him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell me , dear  --  everything . I shall understand . MILLICENT Well , of course , mother  --  I had to see him some place else after school began again and the girls were all back and I was n't going for the mail any more . HERFORD Of course . And where did you see him ? MILLICENT Why , you see  --  it  --  it was awfully hard , mother , dear  --  because I could n't tell anybody . Nobody would have understood  --  except Fanny . She 's such a dear . She 's been so sympathetic through the whole thing , and she has helped me a lot . There is a fire escape out of our room and Mondays and Thursdays at nine o'clock at night  --  HERFORD Oh , my dear  --  MILLICENT What , mother ? HERFORD Nothing  --  go on , dear . MILLICENT At exactly nine I put on Fanny 's long black coat and went down and he was always there and we always went down in the arbor just a little while . HERFORD The arbor ? Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the other side of the drive  --  not far from the house but of course nobody went near it at that time of night  --  in cold weather  --  and  --  and we ' d talk awhile and then I ' d run back . You do n't mind do you , mother ? What else could I do ? HERFORD And  --  he 's kissed you  --  of course , dear ? MILLICENT Of course . HERFORD And you 've kissed him ? MILLICENT Why , of course , mother  --  we 're engaged . HERFORD And what did he say to you there in the arbor ? MILLICENT Well , I ca n't tell you every-thing he said , mother . HERFORD Why not , Millicent ? I 'm your mother . No one on earth is so close to you  --  or loves you so much  --  or cares so much for your happiness  --  or understands so well . I remember when I was engaged to your father  --  I was n't much older than you  --  I know , dear . Tell me what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and strokes her hair  --  choking back her own tears . ) MILLICENT He thinks I 'm pretty , mother . HERFORD Yes . MILLICENT And he thinks I 'm wonderful to understand him and to know what he really is in spite of what he happens to be doing . p. 121 HERFORD Yes  --  And how long did you usually stay there in the arbor ? MILLICENT Oh not very long , Mother  --  only last time it was longer . He teased so and I could n't help it . He  --  he  --  I  --  HERFORD How long was it that time ? MILLICENT Oh  --  it  --  it was almost two hours last time . HERFORD ( Half rising but controlling herself and going back . ) And what did you do all that time ? Was n't it cold ? MILLICENT He made me put his overcoat on . He just made me . HERFORD And he held you close  --  like this and kissed you  --  and told you how much he loved you ? MILLICENT ( Hiding her face on ANN 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother  --  but  --  I  --  to-night , was the night to go again  --  but I  --  HERFORD Yes , dear . MILLICENT I  --  I was  --  afraid to go . Oh , mother  --  ( Throwing her arms about ANN 'S neck . ) Was it wicked to be afraid ? I ran away  --  I wanted to be with you . HERFORD Oh , God ! Oh , God ! Oh , my God ! ( ANN snatches her fiercely in her arms , rocking her like a baby . ) My daughter ! My darling ! My dearest ! You wanted to come to me ! Oh , Millicent  --  my daughter ! My daughter ! What have I done ? ( Someone tries the door and knocks. ) p. 122 HERFORD ( In the hall . ) Ann !  --  Ann ! HERFORD Yes . HERFORD Why is the door locked ? HERFORD Millicent and I are talking . Wait just a few minutes , Tom . And , Tom  --  tell her grandfather not to wait to see Millicent again to-night . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MILLICENT ( In a whisper  --  after listening a moment . ) What are you going to tell father ? HERFORD ( Sitting on the floor by the couch . ) Well  --  you see , dear  --  you 're too young to be married now  --  much too young  --  and  --  MILLICENT Oh , now , mother , if you 're going to talk that way . Wait till you see him . HERFORD That 's just what I want to do . I 've got such a lovely plan for us  --  for the summer . MILLICENT For the summer ? But I want to be married as soon as he gets his  --  HERFORD Yes  --  yes  --  I know , his position  --  And while he 's looking and getting settled this summer you and I will go abroad . p. 123 MILLICENT You 're awfully good , mother , but if you really want to do something for me  --  I 'd rather you 'd give me that money to be married . HERFORD But , Millicent , my dear child  --  I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been working awfully hard this winter and I ca n't go alone , you know . If you wo n't go with me what shall I do ? I 'm tired . You 're the only one in the world who could really be with me and look after me . I need you . MILLICENT Poor mother ! I do n't want to be selfish and if you need me  --  I 'll go . HERFORD Thank you , dear . MILLICENT If you 'll promise me that I can be married when I get back . HERFORD If  --  you  --  still  --  want to  --  marry him when you come  --  back with me  --  you may . I promise . MILLICENT Mother ! I did n't know you loved me so much . ( They kiss each other 's lips . ) HERFORD Did n't you , dear ? ( Rising . ) Now to bed . ( ANN kisses MILLICENT tenderly , as though she were something new and precious . ) MILLICENT What 's the matter , mother ? p. 124 HERFORD Nothing , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) MILLICENT Good night . HERFORD Are you happy  --  my daughter ? MILLICENT Oh , so happy , mother . HERFORD I 'm glad . Good night . ( ANN goes back to the fire . ) HERFORD ( Coming into doorway . ) Not in bed yet ? MILLICENT ( Throwing her arms about her father 's neck . ) Oh , dad , I 'm so happy ! ( She goes out . ) HERFORD ( Sitting . ) Come in , Tom . I want to talk to you about Millicent . HERFORD ( Going to ANN . ) Millicent ? What 's the matter ? HERFORD She thinks she 's in love . HERFORD What ? HERFORD Millicent ! Our baby . She wants to be married . HERFORD What do you mean ? HERFORD That 's why she came home . HERFORD Good Heavens , Ann ! Married ? Millicent ? What has she got mixed up in ? How did it happen ? Who 's the fellow ? How did such a thing happen ? How could it ? p. 125 HERFORD Because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  when she needed me . Do n't say anything , Tom . I ca n't bear it now . I know all you 're thinking . HERFORD Do n't , dear ! Do n't ! It  --  might have  --  happened  --  anyway . HERFORD Oh , the things that can happen ! HERFORD Has she told you everything ? HERFORD Everything . HERFORD What have you said to her ? What are you going to do ? HERFORD I 'm going to take her away  --  and win her till she sees  --  till she gives up  --  of her own free will . I shall have to have the wisdom of all the ages . I shall have to be more fascinating than the boy . That 's a pretty big undertaking , Tom . I wonder if I 'll be equal to it . HERFORD You mean you 're going to give up your frieze and go away with her ? ( ANN nods . ) Can you ? You 're sure , Ann , that 's what you want to do ? HERFORD I 'm only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon just what I can do for her now . I 've looked down deep into her heart . She 's so sweet , so innocent  --  so helpless . Oh , how she needs me . How can I ever be thankful enough I found it out in time ! p. 126 HERFORD I know what all this means to you , dear girl . I wonder if you  --  can ever see it  --  as it is  --  to me ? HERFORD ( Clinging to him . ) Oh , love me , Tom . Love me . ( He holds her  --  kissing her . ) HERFORD ( Moving away . ) Put out the lights . ( She opens the door . TOM turns out the lights . ANN stands in the light , which comes in from the hall and puts out a hand to TOM . He goes to her  --  putting an arm about her .
