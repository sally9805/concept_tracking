Burke , editor of The Catholic World , in which he challenged me to give the volume and page of The Catholic World from which I quoted : " Education must be controlled by Roman Cath011o authorities , even to war and bloodshed . " I naturally suppose Father Burke 's only Object is to find out whether I really have the volume and page of The Catholic World in which the quotation from It is found . I will state directly that I have not . I have written for it . I have three different hooka and pamphlets which contain this special quotation , but none of them gives the volume or page reference . I quoted from a small book entitled " The Church of Rome in American Politics , " a book sent me some years ago from Washington , D. C. , by ik friend . On its cover are these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in part . " On Page 8 of this little book you will find the quotations I made . There are a number of others on Pages 1 ' and 10.
