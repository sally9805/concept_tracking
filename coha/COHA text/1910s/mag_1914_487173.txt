California is certainly the luckiest and most resourceful country in the world . Gold , grain , fruit , wine , petroleum , and tourists have successively and continuously enriched it , and the future is even brighter than the past . The tourist industry , in particular , is sure to grow apace enormously . The Panama Exposition in San Francisco will stimulate it greatly , and it is likely that , while the nations at war will not be able to participate very actively , this loss will be compensated for by the consideration that the great stream of tourists , finding Europe closed , will turn to the West to see their own country . This situation explains the flood of books just now being added to the big library on California previously published . The subject is inexhaustible ; each one of the seven volumes under consideration to-day presents new points of view and is worth reading . Apart from Baedeker , there is no book which gives so much useful information on California for travellers as the first one on our list . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as the routes from place to place within the State , with the cost by rail , boat , or stage , and estimates of hotel expenses , etc . " Considering its longitudinal extent , California is kinder to the automobilist than any State in the Union . " It will soon be possible to motor from the Mexican to the Canadian border and thence from the Pacific to the Atlantic . The time of the year , so far as California is concerned , makes no great difference . There are nearly as many climates as there are counties , and of counties there are fifty-eight , so the tourist can have what he likes . The principal towns and regions most favored by tourists are adequately described in this guide , and there is much incidental information about marvellous fruits , seven-pound radishes , and that sort of thing . San Francisco , made over new , has eight hundredrestaurants , the local flavors of some of which are discussed . Bret Harte 's country is not overlooked , nor does the author forget to describe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a lure that so many books about California have the word Romantic in their title . There is romance a-plenty in the past of the State , and romance in many of its aspects to-day , allied with rare beauty and variety . This romance and beauty form the special subject of Mr. James 's volume , the abundant and excellent illustrations in which ( some in color ) , combined with the persuasive text , make it a potent tract for the region and an entertaining one . The book is the fifth in the See America First series published by the Page Company ( the others being " Old Panama and Castillo Del Oro , " " Three Wonderlands of the American West , " " Houseboating on a Colonial Waterway , " " Panama and the Canal To-day " ) , and its author is already favorably known for half-a-dozen other books on the Southwest . Where his own extensive experience does not seem to him sufficient , he quotes from famous writers , including some interesting accounts of mountain ascents by Muir and others . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it by Californians inspired by their surroundings . The reader is taken along the coast , to the cities , up and down mountain trails , through the deserts , the valleys , the orchards  --  wherever there is romance or beauty  --  generally both . Among the pictures there are photographs of fruits and fish which prove that not all " California stories " of bigness are exaggerations . Mr. James does his best to persuade his readers that there should be many more to enjoy the romance and beauty of California , not only as tourists , but permanently , as settlers . He calls attention to the fact that the British Isles , with an area smaller than California , support over eighteen times its population . Another most abundantly and superbly illustrated book on the same State is the joint production of Sutton Palmer and Mary Austin . How any one can look at these pictures  --  thirty-two of them , all colored  --  pictures of the Yosemite , Lake Tahoe , Tamalpais , eucalyptus groves , Santa Barbara Mission , Santa Cruz Mountains , Shasta , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like that of Redlands , showing the contrast of flowers and ripe oranges below with snow on near-by ranges , which is so delightfully characteristic of Southern California  --  without wanting to rush to the nearest railway ticket office , is beyond comprehension . Sutton Palmer is responsible for these pictures , which are more beautiful and illuminating than photographs , while the text , by Mary Austin , is divided into nine chapters , the titles of which convey a suggestion of their content and spirit : The Sparrow Hawk 's Own , Mothering Mountain , The Coasts of Adventure , The Port of Monterey , Old Spanish Gardens , The Land of the Little Duck , The Twin Valleys , The High Sierras , and The Sage Brush Country . No book on California does the subject justice unless it has a chapter on its trees and flowers , and most of them have one . Charles Francis Saunders devotes a whole book to them . It is not a scientific treatise , nor does it attempt to cover the subject systematically . What the author does is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has delved in old Spanish records  --  but always entertainingly . Here the tourist who is looking forward to a trip will find more miscellaneous facts than elsewhere about the trees , shrubs , and flowering plants that daze and delight every one . Many of them are immigrants , for the Californians delight in importing exotic wayside trees and plants from all parts of the world , as if their own State were not one of the richest of them all . Mr. Saunders has reason to chide the Californians themselves for not knowing  --  though they are so much given to boasting  --  what an important part their country has played in beautifying the gardens of Europe . Not only are they full of California wild flowers , but " before California was discovered gardens were almost deficient in one of their present-day strong points  --  that is , annuals . " Abundant pictures further enhance the charm and value of this book , on which it would be a pleasure to dwell longer if space permitted . Most tourists are glad to know something about the romance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so many of which are Spanish or Indian . Why are the big trees called sequoias ? Why was the second city of the State  --  some now claim for it first place  --  called Los Angeles ? Whence came the name California ? These and hundreds of similar questions are answered by Nellie van de Grift Sanchez , alphabetically and correctly , wherever accurate information was obtainable through patient research , supplemented by information from John Muir and several experts in the universities of the State . Very often the missionaries chose the names still in use ; yet " in many cases the choice of the soldiers has outlived that of the fathers . " Unlike other books of reference , this one can be read through with pleasure from beginning to end . Under La . Brea interesting information is given concerning the asphaltum beds near Los Angeles , which constituted a " death-trap " in the Tertiary Age , and from which nearly a million specimens of animals , including camels and elephants , have been taken . " California , Romantic and Beautiful , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a treatise on the romance or the resources of the State at all , but simply a plea of sixty pages for the collection , preservation , and diffusion of information relating to Pacific Coast history , followed by the Love Story of Concha Arguello , and a poem by Bret Harte . Mr. Davis calls attention to the extraordinary luck of the great Bancroft library of invaluable manuscripts and books in thrice escaping by the narrowest margin destruction by fire . Yet , notwithstanding this collection , and a travelling fellowship for further research recently established , the author thinks that still more should be done before it is too late , and he calls for subscriptions to further this end . The history of California'is , like the State itself , so romantic that it requires no novelist to make it readable . It is needless to say that , nevertheless , Gertrude Atherton 's " intimate history " is more entertaining than most other volumes on its subject , although she does not romance in the least , but sticks to the facts established by other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there is the sure touch resulting from being a native of the State and knowing it thoroughly in all its aspects . There is much that appeals to the imagination . San Francisco , the most interesting city in the Union , is most vividly pOrtrayed ; there is a graphic chapter on gold and the incredible barbarisms of mining life ; and the very names of some of the other chapters suggest the brilliant use the author has made of them : The War , The Terrible Seventies , The Chinese Must Go , Last Phases . One of these last phases is woman suffrage , which , as she notes , was won with the country vote by " the women who had taken motors and visited practically every farmer and hamlet in the State . " CURRENT FICTION . The Demi-Gods . By James Stephens . New York : The Macmillan Co . Patsy MacCann was a travelling tinker , a tramp , and a thief ; and after this concession to the dictates of truth and candor , it may be added , without offence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , a book reviewer . In this capacity he observes : " A good story has to be about ordinary things , but there is n't anybody who could tell what your story was about . " If the present tale is not a good one , judged by Patsy 's canon , it possesses , none the less , many of the characteristics that made the charm of " The Crock of Gold . " It relates the wanderings of MacCann and his daughter Mary , with three angels for steady company , and the occasional companionship of Eileen Ni Cooley , an undesirable , Billy the Music , and a sort of visiting angel , Cuchulain , in somewhat patronizing attendance upon Brien O'Brien . Brien dies twice in these pages , spending the interval in mischief of various kinds and the pursuit of his 16st three-penny piece . It might be supposed that Patsy and the angels would make an oddly assorted party . But no . " The angels were strangely like Patsy MacCann . Their ideas of right and wrong almost entirely coincided with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no prejudices . " Indeed , the proposition that immediately follows seems fairly to afford common standing ground for angels and larcenous tinkers : Civilization , haying built itself at hazard upon the Rights of Property , has sought on many occasions to unbuild itself again in sheer desperation of any advance , but from the great Ethic of Possession there never has been any escape , and there never will be , until the solidarity of man has beenreally created , and until each man ceases to see the wolf in his neighbor . So Archangel , Seraph , and Cherub walk the pleasant Irish countryside for a space , ever and anon elucidating the mysteries of Cosmos by means of stories  --  a method as old as the world . And the patient ass , friend and servant of the company , listens appreciatively , and even , in the ' end , delivers itself of five little stories  --  though how and to whom does not appear . At last the time comes for the angels to " go away " ; and Finaun , the archangel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and depart . But not so Art , the cherub , who , remembering Mary MacCann , rends his beautiful raiment and remains . And so we emerge from the atmosphere of mysticism and rub our eyes as we watch Art and his love pacing down the narrow track , his great arm laid about her shoulder . Pierre Vinton . By Edward C. Venable . New York : Charles Scribner 's Sons . Happy are the story-tellers who can adjust themselves to changed conditions . Is romance dead , just because stalwart youth and tender maiden no longer mate in the old blushing Victorian fashion and live happy ever after  --  even supposing that they do n't ? Not a bit of it . Shall the field of romance be narrowed because divorces multiply and Reno flourishes ? Never . Rather out of the legal separation of two loving hearts will we build up romance anew , and where before was but one wedding , through the beneficent institution of divorce we will make two to grow . This is what Mr. Venable does in " Pierre Vinton : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be said that he does it uncommonly well . How Pierre allowed himself to be divorced , not wanting to in the least , but feeling that it was only the gentlemanly thing to do , as his charming young wife , to whom he had never refused anything , appeared to desire it , is exceedingly well told . The subsequent wooing of the pair , who would never have been sundered if they had duly observed the exhortations of the gentleman who married them , may almost be described as an idyll of divorce . The compromising situation in which they find themselves at the end , and which calls from a mutual friend the warning telegram , " Pour l'amour de Mike , soyez raisonnable , " is quite delightful . Mr. Venable has a light touch , and his pages are illuminated with flashes of quiet humor . Arcadian Adventures with the Idle Rich. - 13y Stephen Leacock . New York : John Lane Co . In the present volume , not the least of Mr. Leacock 's happy fancies is his selection of a title which exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the volume is complete in itself , but they are loosely ' connected by the locality of " Plutoria Avenue , " and the recurrence in them of various personages who inhabit that thoroughfare . Some of these characters are deliciously conceived , with just the touch of exaggeration that is required for satire , but without the distortion that turns the picture into caricature . Dr. Boomer , for instance , the president of the university , is a familiar type , remote as the poles from the cloistered calm that one associates historically with the academic life , a hustling , business-like personage , ever ready with an oration , and keeping a weather-eye always open for benefactions from the wealthy . There is not a little verity in this description of the president 's tactics : " Indeed , it was part of Dr. Boomer 's method to get himself endowed first with premises too big for the apparatus , ' and then by appealing to public spirit to call for enough apparatus to more than fill the premises , by means of which system industrial science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not less to the point is the exposition of certain modern ideals of the function of a university : " It the university offered such a vast variety of themes , topics , and subjects to the students , that there was nothing that- a student was compelled to learn , while from its own presses in its own press-building it sent out a shower of bulletins and monographs like driven snow from a rotary hough . " And this , as a sly dig at " vocational training , " is quite delicious : " A foreign visitor once said that the students looked like plumbers , and President Boomer was so proud of it that he put the phrase in his next commencement address ; and from there the newspapers got it , and the Associated Press took it up and sent it all over the United States with the heading , ' Have Appearance of Plumbers ; Phitoria University Congratulated on Character of Students , ' and it was a proud day indeed for the heads of the industrial science faculty . " Yourself and the Neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co . Only an Irishman could have written this book , and perhaps only an Irishman can fully appreciate it . But there is pleasure in it for any lover of simple and unspoiled human nature . It is a series of sketches , lovingly and minutely detailed , of peasant life in Donegal . The style is that of intimate reminiscence , sometimes a trifle too garrulous , at least for the redder who has not the right store of memories to draw upon . Nearly all the narrative is in the second person ; and this too becomes tiresome if " yourself " is in the least bit of a hurry . But if you are content to read leisurely , you can follow with much quiet enjoyment " Yourself and Herself " through school-days , courting days , and married life to contented old age .

You will spend the day cutting turf in the bog , and will listen in the evening to stories of the Gentle People , and Phelimy Og , and Denis a-Cuinn , and the Grey Man . Altogether it will be your own fault entirely if you do not enjoy yourself . An idea of the style may be obtained from this anecdote of the first day at school : Your hardihood had to stand its final test in the Square Park after school was loosed There , while the other pairs of knights waited their turn , you planted your black bare foot opposite Micky Tummoney 's very black bare foot , and the two of you glared at each other  --  all the more fearfully because neither of you knew what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading unprovoked hostilities , any one of a dozen obliging friends ( agents provocateurs ) , always prompt to further a good cause , extended a horizontal arm between you , saying , " Who der ' spit over that ?

The Hibbert Lectures , May and June , 1913 . New York : Charles Scribner 's Sons . $2 lien After having made a careful study of the life of Mohammed and prepared a sketch of his religious system , Dr. Margoliouth has begun to investigate " the supplementing of the Koran . " The material used is in the main recently printed works of Moslem authors of the third century of the Hegira . An advance guard of present-day Mohammedans has evidently arrived at the point of desiring easy access to their ancient documents , though scarcely any of them are as yet capable of scientific criticism . ' Accordingly they publish texts which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hurgronje , Macdonald , and Margoliouth , are examining with similar intent to that of the many great scholars who have sought to comprehend the origin and growth of Christianity by the interpretation of its early literature . The title of the present book is considerably more ambitious than its contents justify . The author believes , perhaps erroneously , that " Islam was far more a political than a religious system , " but he makes no attempt to follow out the direct line of its political development . Nor does he trace other elements which were equally a part of the singularly unified Mohammedan scheme of life , such as the constitutional , the military , the commercial , the educational , and the literary aspects . Moreover , within his chosen topics , which are the Koran , the Sacred Law , the tolerated communities , and the ethical , ascetic , philosophical , and historical supplements to the Koran , he does not attempt a complete survey , but presents the point of view of a limited number of original authorities . But the material he proVides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in content or in point of view . The Koran and not the Caliphs took the place of the deceased Prophet . For a century and a half it was deemed the only necessary Moslem writing . But a great mass of oral material , interpretative or supplementary , was accumulated rapidly . In time much of this was written down . The author 's general tendency is to minimize the introduction of ideas from outside during the period of oral tradition . Admitting that Mohammed was under some influence from Jews , Greeks , and Christians , he denies that these , or Romans , Hindus , and Persians , had much to da with the unfolding of Moslem thought and life . He is able even to find a sufficient basis for the Sufic development through asceticism to pantheism in Mohammed 's insistence that " there is no God but Allah , with whom nothing can be associated . " It is hard to agree with the view that the early Moslem progress was so unrelated . When an undeveloped people , supplied with a fresh combination of powerfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by great numbers of more advanced peoples , and later is found in possession of views that had existed long among the conquered peoples , it is easier to believe that these views were adopted than that they were rapidly and independently expanded out of the original ideas , however possible an expansion of this kind may be from a logical point of view . Had the writer brought within his ken a larger amount of Moslem material of the fourth and fifth centuries , he could hardly have rejected many evident derivations from Roman law and government , from Persian ceremony and mysticism , and from Greek philosophy and science . Nor is it likely that these influences became operative only as late as the tenth century of the Christian era . Close contact , of certain sorts , especially with Romans and Persians , was established within five years after the death of Mohammed , and relations were thenceforth steadily broadened and deepened with the growth of empire and the bringing in of countless converts . Exception may also be taken to the assertion with which the author begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preached with the sword , for without going into the water one can not learn to swim , and there Is no probationary dip . " For though no unbeliever might in the early days lawfully purchase or touch a copy of the Koran , or enter a mosque , or witness a pilgrimage , there were always alternative ways of becoming acquainted with Moslem belief and practice . In fact , the writer himself admits the existence of several methods of non-forcible conversion ( pp. 132 , 133 ) : among these , however , that of the persuasion of unbelievers by believers finds no place . Is Dr. Margoliouth unacquainted with J. W. Arnold 's convincing book , " The Preaching of Islam " ? In fact , the general criticism may be made that the writer has placed too exclusive reliance upon a few original authorities , and has not sufficiently enlarged his point of view by consulting carefully the works of modern predecessors and contemporaries . Mohammedans and some Christian scholars will hardly be pleased with the assertion that the earliest life of the Prophet " places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and private virtues on the side of Mohammed 's enemies " ; nor can they accept the sharp concluding contrast drawn between the historical and the fictitious Mohammed , of whom the one is made out to be a resourceful but unscrupulous politician , and the other " the legislator , the saint , and the thaumaturge . " Other interesting questions are raised by the writer , which reveal extensive possibilities of critical research into many phases of the vast Moslem civilization The foundations of many familiar statements in regard to it are evidently far from secure . AN OPPONENT OF FEDERAL GOVERN-MENT . Antigonos Gonatas . By William Woodthorpe Tarn . Oxford : The Clarendon Press . 14s. net . This book deserves our attention on several grounds It is the work , not of a professional scholar , but of a lawyer who has made Greek history his avocation ; yet it is distinguished by the rigor of its method and the mastery it evinces of the sources and the scientific literature of the subject . Its central figure is less known even in professional circles than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathetic interpretation he has now for the first time received for two reasons that the general reader can appreciate : he was the patron of Zeno , the founder of Stoicism , and he was the persistent adversary of the first experiment in federal government known to history . Naturally , Mr. Tarn has been alive to the outstanding aspects of his theme . His first chapter , entitled The Teachers of Antigonos , puts Zeno into his historical milieu ; his eighth , Antigonos and His Circle , introduces us happily to the group of poets , philosophers , and historians which the King 's personal interest in their work attracted to his court : Persaios , Zeno 's unworthy deputy ; Aratos of Soli , whose famous poem , the much-translated , horribly dull " Phainomena , " did not merely provide " dry bread for readers surfeited with literary sugarplums , " but represents " the first halting attempt that the world has seen ' with patient plan To justify the ways of God to man ' ? to bring out the Stoic doctrine of Providence " ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has risen steadily with the decline of the notion that history is merely a literary exercise ; Biwa the wandering cynic from Borysthenes , half-mountebank , half-preacher , the coiner of phrases whose " downright vulgarity struck Plutarch no less forcibly than it does ourselves , " the author of the winged words in regard to the dying frog , " The boys stone it in sport , but the frog dies in simple earnest " ? a man of dual nature , an Odysseus in beggar 's rags , thought the great contemporary scientist Eratosthenes . All of these men are considered in this chapter in the light of their personal friendship with Antigonos . In regard to the dEtolian League , Mr. Tarn nowhere takes a very definite position ; he simply describes its growth , and inadequately explains its nature . Of its Achwan rival he has more to say . His attitude to it and to Greek federalism in general is frankly hostile . " The A.chman League in fact , " he says , " was a bit of the Macedonian. empire broken off and fitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a part of that empire had been to act as a counterpoise to Sparta ; and this remained its function , " This is , we think , to minimize greatly the importance of the federal movement ; it is to view it too exclusively from the Macedonian point pf view of Antigonos Gonatas ; and , taken as a whole , Mr. Tarn 's book is nothing less than a consideration of half a century of eventful Greek history from the standpoint of Macedon 's King , That federalism , despite its ultimate failure , was something more than a visionary project or a form of government devised for a bit of the Macedonian empire broken off , is shown by the fact that , notwithstanding Gonatas 's refusal to make any compromises with it , his statesmanlike kinsman , Antigonos Doson , adopted it as the basis of his unification of Hellas , and even went so far as to make Macedon itself a federal league . PUNISHMENT AND REFORM . Those Who Have Come Back . By Peter Clark MacFarlane . Boston : Little , Brown &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By Winifred Louise Taylor . New York : Charles Scribner 's Sons . $1.50 net . ? The science of criminology and the art of philanthropy have done much , in the course of a generation , towards checking the production of criminals , humanizing the state 's treatment of them after conviction , and increasing their chances of reform . Of the theories and methods involved in this progress journalism has made much copy . Is heredity or environment the chief factor in the breeding of crime ? Was Lombroso right about his " criminal type " ? Are a considerable proportion of prisoners innocent , or at least more sinned against than sinning ? Is the whole idea of punishment to be supplanted by an idea of reform and rescue ? The two books before us deal somewhat emotionally with the criminal and his relation to society . The fundamental conviction upon which they both are based is that the " man behind the bars " is a fellow-being and not a monster ; that accident or circumstance , not innate depravity , is ordinarily responsible for his plight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable , under favorable conditions , of becoming a useful member of society instead of a burden upon it  --  of " coming back . " Yet these books are radicallydifferent in source and in spirit . The author of " Those Who Have Come Back " has seen an opening in the case of the criminal for a series of good magazine " stories . " He has caught the peculiar jaunty , snappy style which " gets across " with that immense grammar-schooled public to Which the ten-cent magazine stands for literature . He has chosen a number of instances of persons far gone in vice and crime who have " come back " and " made good " No glamour is to be cast about these crooks qua crooks ; but they are represented as victims rather than degenerates or defectives : As long as we have poverty in our midst desperate want will revolt in desperate deeds , and poverty we shall have until the race has reached a higher average of thrift and efficiency , and industrial conditions are developed on a basis of fairness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moral nature of a man undue pressure of temptation , brought to hear on that link , will cause it to break , even while in his heart the man may be hungering and thirsting for righteousness Miss Taylor 's book is written from a different experience and a different motive . She addresses an audience , not a market . She also believes that " the criminal problem is one of conditions quite as much as ' cases . ' In our large cities , the reservoirs of crime , we are but reaping the harvest of centuries of evil in older civilizations , and in our own civilization as well . " She also has instances to cite of criminals who have come back . " In my preconceived opinion , the most hopeless case I ever assisted surprised me by settling down , under favorable environment , into an honest , self-supporting citizen . " But she has not " got up " her subject as an outsider may . For many years she has studied prisoners and made friends of them . She writes of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her nature , but it belongs also to her method of approaching them : " Doubtless the key to my own position is the fact that I have always studied these prisoners as men ; and I tried not to obscure my vision by looking at them through their crimes . " Her experience makes her indignant at our ruthless legal methods , especially in the cities : " Railroading men to prison is purely a matter of business ; no consideration is given to the individual accused , he is no longer a human being , he is simply a ' case . ' " She also dwells on the cruelties and crudities of prison discipline , the enforced speech of the " third degree , " the more deadly enforced silence of the cells and the prison-yard . Of the more humane methods now coming into use , of the probation system , and so on , she speaks with hopefulness . But the movement has only begun , the great tradition is yet to be broken , and Miss Taylor puts her trust in no half-measures : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , she sums up , " but thousands of individuals and millions of dollars have been sacrificed to wrong methods of punishment ; and if we aim to reform our criminals we must first reform our methods of dealing with them , from the police courts to the penitentiary . " ORIENTAL MYTHS . Myths of the Hindus and Buddhists . By Sister Nivedita and Ananda Coomaraswamy . New York : Henry Holt &; Co. $4.50 ' net . The scope of this volume is ambitious  --  the material is collated with a view to satisfying a popular interest in two of the great religions of India ; but was it wise to assume that a similarity of thought and fancy justifies their being presented as part of some one fabric ? It is not to be expected that two exponents of Hinduism could do justice to Buddhism in so intimate a juxtaposition . The Hindu student is characteristically inclined to exploit Buddhism for the Western reader as one of the manifestations of his own intellectual life . Here , the Buddhist myths are arbitrarily injected into the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter , and without clear explanation to the reader  --  an illogical arrangement . In issuing from Brahmanism , Buddhism carried with it a great stock of notions , mythological and cosmographical , as well as philosophical ; but it had elements of original vitality  --  chiefly its founder 's personality ? which so sharply distinguished it that an assimilation of the new with the old is - unthinkable from the Buddhist point of view . After all , an association may be justified when we come to folk-lore and legend , in which sphere the two religions hold more or less in common , for example , the Ramayana story . As the authors assert , a version of this epic is to be found in one of the J ? takas . It should be remembered that the Jatakas were put into their present shape as late as about the fifth century A. n. in Ceylon ; but the collection existed in a more or less copious form as early as the time of Asoka ( 250 a . C. ) , while the materials embodied date from times immemorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 252 ) is a favorite in early plastic art . It can hardly be said ( p. 245 ) that Buddha 's father was raja of the Sakiyas : authentic Pali sources speak of a , republic . What is meant by the statement ( p. 248 ) that Buddha lived and died a Hindu ? His sneering remarks about the " Brahmins versed in the Three Vedas " are inconsistent with any continued recognition of Vedic authority , which , presumably then as later , was the criterion of orthodoxy . The Hindu stories from the epics are well told and are a tribute to the enthusiasm with which Sister Nivedita entered into Hindu life and thought , in her endeavor to bring Western sympathy and understanding nearer the subject race . Of the beautiful illustrations in the volume more than passing mention might be made . Briefly , the care and scholarship shown by the Indian illustrators are a favorable omen for the establishment of a school in the worthy traditions that obtained during the seventh and eighth centuries , the classic period of Indian art .
