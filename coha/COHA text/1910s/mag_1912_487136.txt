From the long explanation put forth on Saturday by Mr Roosevelt , regarding his position on Trusts and monopolies , it is evident enough that he has become aware of how the public feels about licensing monopolies He is accused , he says , by Gov . Wilson and Mr. Brandeis , of " endeavoring to legalize monopolies by a commission , which would have police power to say to a favored corporation . ' You are legal , ' and to an unfavored corporation . ' You are ' illegal ' " This , Mr. Roosevelt proceeds , is not only not his position , but the antithesis of his position He adds- I am accused of wanting to give the commission the power to fix prices . I do not want to provide that I fancy the commission would be so busy for a time in erforcing laws that it would not want to concern itself ' with prices This last statement looks a bit like begging the question , but let that pass What Mr. Roosevelt did say in his speech of August 6 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reprint of that speech given out from the Progressive headquarters ? Was that " any corporation voluntarily coming under the commission should not be prosecuted under the Anti-Trust law , so long as it obeys in good faith the orders of the commission " " Any corporation " is a fairly broad term What Mr. Roosevelt said in his address to the Ohio Constitutional Convention , last February , was that , where regulation by competition proves insufficient , " we should not shrink from bringing Government regulation to the point of control of monopoly prices " The same declaration , in almost identical language , was made in his widely quoted Outlook article of last November This little inconsistency of Mr. Roosevelt 's is only one of the signs that the Third Party has found its plank on Trusts and monopolies a serious handicap to its campaign . From the first appearance of the " TVust movement , " in its shape of the last dozen years , the American citizen has protested against control of the fortunes of any industry by a corporation or body of corporations , built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppressing competition . He has beard , especially these last ' two or three years of Anti-Trust law prosecutions , a good deal to the effect that the " era of competition is dead " and that its death was essential for industrial welfare . But he has had in his inmost heart the conviction that these assertions were the last line of defence for the very monopolies or potential monopolies which he dreaded . In the light of this conviction , he formed his opinion on the subsequent propositions . When the chairman of the United States Steel Corporation , two years ago , urged continued dominance by such huge trade combinations  --  subject , however , to restraint , through a Federal commission , on the raising of prices for their commodities too high  --  the ordinary American was quick to express his double inference , first , that this proposal was an expedient to perpetuate exactly those conditions which he feared , and secondly , that , if adopted , it would lead the nation far along on the path to the system of state socialism which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the sake of ' preserving trade prosperity , the idea of licensed monopoly might not have become inevitable . But he has listened since then to ex-Senator Edmunds 's exposition of the probability that such a commission , instead of controlling the Trusts , would itself be controlled by them through the politicians He has read Mr. Brandeis 's demonstration that , in point of fact , economies in production and capture of neutral markets have been achieved , not by the Trusts , but by independent ecmpetaive producers . His plain common sense taught him - hat both these views were right . To an electorate in this state of mind came the Progressive party , with its platform advocating precisely that relation between government and monopoly , and with its early campaign speeches reiterating the assertion that the era of competition was and ought to be at an end . In last week 's Independent , Prof. John B. Clark of Columbia writes on " The Parties and the Supreme Issue . " He vows himself a Republican and the descendant of a long line of Republicans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the campaign , he aligns himself with the Democratic Party . That overshadowing issue , he declares , is the treatment of the great business corporations . He rejects the Republican party 's programme on this matter , because those protective duties hick " make exorbitant prices possible in the American market , and leave a Trust free from danger from foreign rivals and able to use its resources in crushing competitors at home , " are upheld by it . Turning to the Third Party , he takes up its notion of letting " good Trusts " alone and regulating prices of their products through an- adn  --  inistrative commission . Tho complexity and difficulty of the plan , its " chances of error and of cori wiling influence , " every one can recognize . But there is a far more serious objection . With the world crowding itself more and more densely with people , the art of extracting a living from it must be practiced more and more effectively We must invent new machinery , discover new raw materials , use new motive power Otherwise humanity will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can guarantee such progress is competition The evidence is readily at hand What motive has monopoly  --  especially monopoly licensed by law but regulated as to prices  --  for progress of this sort ? When a producer , under such regime , lowered the cost of his product , he would merely be inviting reduction of the price of it . The spur of competition gone , the motive for progressive economy would vanish with it . The instinct of such " regulated monopoly , " with competition dead , would be to " adhere to old methods and keep its antiquated appliances . " Monopoly , by the nature of the case , " is hostile to progress " ; the promises of the Progressive platform may easily " amount to a surrender to monopoly , " and " a proposal of price regulation involves some expectation of thus surrendering . " So much for this economist 's verdict on the Third Party 's attitude towards that issue . It is coupled with the frank admission that the Democratic party , through its promise of reasonable reform of abuses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserved and that no corporation should be allowed to become monopoly , offers tim single solution of the problem . " The vital incentive to progress , " concludes this Eopublican critic of the Democratic Platform , " the hope of large future proeu  --  tion , the prospect of a rising level for human life , , are staked on this restoration of the force that insures them . " It may be that Professor Clark has merely expressed in words the suspicions and misgivings already pervading every thinking mind . But it is well to hav , e such indictments of a political declaration framed in convincing language  --  as was done ( with almost equal iduetance , because of old associations ) by Senator Lodge in regard to the party s judiciary plank , and as might be done , if it were worth the trouble , in : egal d to its Populistic declaration on Ate currency . We imagine that when the political history of 1912 is written ' for the next generation , the student will . ; Lc invited to consider the extraordinary incidcnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole electorate was crying out at the rising cost of living , calmly inviting that electorate to ratify a plan for licensing monopolies in the necessities of life . HISTORICAL PARALLELS . Despite the well-known fact that , as John Morley has put it , " historical parallels are a snare to working statesmen , " they continue to be pressed into service . That working statesman , the President of the United States , is the latest to seek comfort in what he supposes to be an analogy between the past and the present . The common opinion to-day is that the Republican party will be beaten in November , if for no other reason , because it is badly split up . But this does not follow , declares Mr. Taft . " Fifty-two years ago , " he remarks in it statement of rather forced good cheer , " seceders from the Union thought they were facing . a divided North and would win an easy victory . " But " history teaches us " that they did not , and in this the President sees a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter , however , to affirm that the year 1860 is a particularly unhappy one for ' the President to cite . For in that Presidential campaign the Republican , party faced a divided Democracy , and expected to- win , and did in fact win , a victory on account of the dissentions of its opponents . If parallels are to be . drawn with fifty-two years ago , this is the one that really applies to the present year of grace . The only alternative is to maintain that Republicans have a monopoly of historical parallels , as of - the other good things of life , and that the Democrats can not win even when they have both history and mathematics on their side . But does not history repeat itself ? " Yes , but usually with a difference ; and to detect that difference is the great task  --  we might almost say the despair ? of those who seek accurate guidance for to-day from yesterday . Most scientific historians of the present time would agree with Lotze that there is no such thing as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to predict the future . The true function of history is not so much to solve present-day questions as to teach us to examine , to be cautious , to weigh evidence ; constantly reminding us that those who are nearest to some great event seldom fully understand it . This is not to deny that historical parallels are highly interesting . They are often very illuminating . But it is always Possible that they may mislead us . No two men , however wide their knowledge or keen their insight , will read the moral the same . Mr. Bryce has touched with his usual mastery upon the fallacies that lurk in historians ' parallels . He gave an amusing illustration which has its significance for what is now going on in the Near East . It was in 1876 , at the time of the great agitation over the Bulgarian massacres and the course which Great Britain ought to pursue , that Mr. Bryce one day met an eminent professor of history . He was a man very fond of talking about historical knowledge as the only true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what followed may be given in Mr. Bryce 's words : I said , " Here is a fine opportunity for applying your doctrines . Party politicians may be divided , but no student of history can doubt which is the right course for the Government to follow towards Russia and the Turks . " " Certainly , " he replied , " the teachings of history are plain ! ' " You mean , of course , " I said , scenting some signs of disagreement , " that we ought to warn the Sultan that he is wholly in the wrong and can have no support from us ? " " No , indeed , " rejoined my friend , " I mean just the opposite . " ? It is probable that the break-up of the Whig party , after 1856 , with its disappearance in the Republican party , has given more aid and comfort  --  and brought more disappointment  --  than any other event in the history of our politics . Innovators and founders of new parties have ever since been arguing and hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the belief that it would do to the Republican party what the Republican did to the Whig In the other political camp , the Populists were confident , about twenty years ago , that they were to push aside or absorb the Democratic party . But it was the Populists who were swallowed and became lost to sight ; and the Prohibitionists have had to give way to the Progressives as the party that is going to be the death of the Republican , as it was of the Whig . No prediction is more frequently heard from Progressives than that 1912 is to stand with 1856 in our political history . They are fascinated by the parallel , which they imagine to be exact in every particular . But the Republican party has several times before this year refused to break up or die , as in decent consideration for the prophets it should have done , and it may again fool those who are sitting by its bedside and expecting soon to enter upon its estate . If it does die , we may be sure that the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To go back to Mr. Taft 's parallel , it can not , of course , be said that a divided party is without exception a beaten party , but the general rule is certainly that way . And in politics men will , after all the subtle reasoning addressed to them , fall back upon what they believe to be experience , averages , and general rules . The thing was neatly stated by Col. Hay in 1896 . A correspondent , anxious as he was for the election of McKinley , wrote him with apprehension about the formation of the Gold Democratic party . He feared it would draw many votes that would otherwise go to the Republicans . Col. Hay , in a private letter , said that it might be so ; he was n't much of a politician , and events might be getting away from him ; but somehow he could n't get over the homely notion that you had ' a better chance when your opponents were divided and quarrelling . A BAFFLING WAR . It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Turkey and the Balkan states have plunged into war . The conflict seemed so preventable . For weeks we had assurances that it would be prevented . Diplomacy was to strain all its resources . The financial world was to interpose obstacles . Reason and statesmanlike prudence were to be made what Kinglake called the Great Tradition  --  would not permit even the conqueror to reap the fruits of victory , would burst upon civilization and take it by surprise . In this attitude of mind attentive observers were strengthened by the activity of the European Governments . It may be that these waked late to the peril , but they bestirred themselves in ways that before have been effective For our part , we do not question the good faith of these diplomatic efforts . It is easy to throw out hints and suspicions of intrigue and secret countermining in such affairs , but in this instance , at least , the interests of the nations concerned were too much at one with their professions to make it anything but an abuse of skepticism to challenge their sincerity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labored earnestly and honestly to avert hostilities . On this point , the the Great Powers were of one mind in taking steps to preserve peace in the Balkans . They were all agreed , he said , in the representations to be made both at Constantinople and to the Balkan states , and spoke of this fact as almost a " guarantee " of peace . The result is nearly as bitter a comment on the prescience of statesmen as was the breaking out of the Franco-German war just after another English-Foreign Secretary , Lord Granville , had assured Parliament that there was not a cloud on the European horizon . To assert of the diplomatic negotiations which were undertaken to prevent the war that they were serious and in good faith , is not , however , the same thing as saying that they were eminent ly skilful . The Great Powers had come to an agreement upon two lines of procedure . The first was to impress in the strongest way upon Turkey the necessity of carrying out the reforms promised by the Treaty of Berlin , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to the Parie Temps , about the manner in which this pressure was to be brought to bear at that this would carry the semblance of a threat , and insisted upon having the representations made individually . To this M. Poincare and M Sazonoff finally assented . But the Turk has of old known how to deal with the Powers when they came one by one . The other action agreed upon by the diplomats was to let the Balkan principalities understand in the plainest way that the Great Powers would not permit a war to bring about , " any change in the status quo in Southeastern Europe " Russia and Austria , as the nations most directly concerned , were chosen to make this representation . If it was strongly made , and the evidence of intention to back it up was perfectly clear , it would indeed seem to take away the motive of territorial enlargement , and by so much to justify the confidence of the diplomatic world that there would be no war That war should have been precipitated , in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have heard much of the wrongs of the Christians in Macedonia , and doubtless they have been grievous . They are put in the forefront of the proclamation of war by the King of Bulgaria , who would give the war the appearance of a sacred crusade . Without denying the grievances and cruelties which he recites , we must yet ask if the skirts of the Christians of that region are entirely clear , and if bloody retaliation , as well as governmental oppression , has not been suffered by Moslems as well as Christians . On this point an educated Turk now in England , Halil Halid Bey , a member of the Young Turkish party . recently said to the Manchester Guardzan : " I wish I could get people ' - honestly to compare the condition of the Christians in Turkey with that of Moslems in Bulgaria . There are still 600,000 , Mohammedans living in Bulgaria , and their condition is intolerable and : abominable . We hear little about that . " The feeling of humanity , confessing itself baffled and cast down by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in various ways . The Red Cross is preparing to take the field . Funds are asked to help relieve the wounded and the destitute . Already moving stories are arriving about the suffering witnessed by military correspondents . The Montenegrin hospital service is wholly inadequate . ' Slackness and filth abound . The surgeons are listless and inattentive . All this , and much more like it , is expected to appeal powerfully to the humane instincts of the civilized world . So it should appeal , and we hope the response may be as generous as the need is great . But we are thrown back by it all upon the original puzzle ? why must humanity be compelled to keep on simply relieving the victims of war , and giving shining examples of self-sacrifice amid its horrible barbarities , yet continue powerless to prevent the recurrence of these savageries ? The best sentiments of mankind can not be forever thwarted in this way . " FREEING " WRITTEN ENGLISH . In the November Harper 's , Professor Lounsbury returns to a subject near his : heart . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ array of bad usage gathered from reputable writers . The confusion of " who " with " whom , " and vice versa , which one readily falls into in conversation , he finds in the , printed page . We infer from the drift of his article that the most flagrant of . these instances does not offend his ear . Sir John Mackintosh , writing to his , daughters in 1813 , says , " I found the whole fashionable literary world occupied with Madame de Stael , whom you ' know was the author , of ' Corinne . ' " We , are told again of Milton 's " than whom , " and are assured that the " it is I , " for-which some of us virtuously hold out against " it is me , " is not the " etymologically correct form " at all . If we insist upon being purists , we should say " it am I " ! In proof whereof listen to , Palemon in Chaucer 's " Knight 's Tale " : I am thy mortal foe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That I will di ? present in her sight . It would not do to retort that possiblyPalemon 's language is meant to reflect the incoherence of his great passion , for undoubtedly Professor Lounsburyhas other examples on hand . We are not so much troubled about the various " irregularities " for which the writer contends ( although many of-them seem hardly fair tests , since theyare taken from conversation , which even among well-educated people is seldom in the form they use in writing ) as we are concerned for the principle involved . It is a small matter that Sir Lucius O'Trigger , in " The Rivals , " should ask , " Who the devil is he talking to ? " or the mother in " Pride and Prejudice " say , " Who is it from ? " Such citations are good arguments ' to fling at the old-fashioned school-marm . There can , of course , be no strict application of logic to language , with no leeway granted for the growth of idiom . As well might logic be imposed upon English pronunciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the one principle are likely to attempt the other . Cambridge still talks of the worthy dame from the West who bought her meat from the " man at the Manhattan Market , " making every " a " as broad as Boston . But we had supposed that the typical pedant was well-nigh extinct , together with his favorite doctrine , " A preposition is a bad word to end a sentence with . " The tendency in teaching has seemed to be much in the opposite direction of late . Time was when grammars were as important text-books as any in the curriculum . Students respected rules for English quite as much as those for Latin . This was the attitude which produced Lowell and Holmes , as well as that slightly stilted but substantial style which nearly every educated gentleman could handle . There is no mistaking it . It looks out sturdily from the majority of volumes of that past generation . Sense of rule , sense of form , guided it and made of it a somewhat conscious medium of art . But re . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of grammar . Lists of selections form the text , and boys and girls are set to imitating various types and manners . What has happened is that the emphasis has been shifted from one of the usually-held factors of good usage to the other . Rule ( which ultimately , of course , gets its authority from the consensus of careful - writers ) has largely yielded to the sway of immediate precedent . Professor Lounsbury is therefore merely in the advance guard of a movement which has become pretty general Just at this tithe when democratic impulses are to the fore , the radical wing of the movement is made to have the look of an emancipation proclamation ? Let ussanction as good usage what the majority of the people write . Precedent , in reality , is sought merely to confirm popular looseness and freedom of utterance . Professor Lounsbury realizes that many persons say " between you and I , " and his scholarship reminds him that this construction is to be found in Shakespeare . What better precedent could one desire ? " Like I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it an error when it has perhaps been used by Defoe ? The principle is dangerous , for every one knows that an amazing list of awkward and careless expressions could be gathered from the range of English masterpieces . Professor Hill of Harvard was not opening himself to ridicule in noting with a chuckle a mistake here and there in George Eliot , Dickens , and others . If present usage ie to be largely controlled by haphazard precedent , the question arises , Where shall we stop ? Would Professor Lounsbury reinstate the eighteenth-century " you was " ? or would he accept the latest ephemeral vulgarity of the Broadway dialect ? The fact is that , if we wish to learn good English , we must go not to the scholar who spends his life cataloguing words and phrases , but to the cultivated man who has trained his sense of language by much familiarity with the standard writers and who has learned to distinguish between what is sporadic and what is normal . In point of fact , rules for written English appear to us to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be thrown up against the encroachment of the colloquial . As matters stand , there is little danger that the written word will drag far behind the spoken word , and therefore fail to reflect accurately the life of the day . We all know how smart it is to fill an article or an essay with the last cry . This can not go on indefinitely without breaking down the structure of English and destroying its use for complicated and subtle expression . Rules , naturally , will not be tyrants in such a matter as a living language , which must grow with the time . And we have no desire to see hindranceg placed in the way of forming those new , robustious combinations which every age has invented . But this is very different from giving sanction to careless thought and speech by recourse to specific example . Suchbroadmindedness amounts to an inverted sort of pedantry which is itself a slave to rule of thumb . CORNER MEETINGS .

At five minutes past eight a militant fife and drum corps parading the sidewalk gives utterance to the earnest desire that it might immediately be transported to Dixie .

At diagonally opposite corners , where the avenue and the street cross , he finds the rival orators at work .

On the fringe of the crowd are the women , most of whom have paused to listen on their way to the drug-gist 's . The corner orator is the victim of a misconception . It is quite unjust to describe his efforts as cart-tail oratory with all that this term implies of undignified , violent , unscrupulous , and ungi propaganda . The charge of bad grammar may hold true , but as for the other counts , we need only compare the corner orator 's methods with those employed by the big guns of the campaigns , Congressmen , Governors , ' and United States Senators . It is the men of light and leading who go in extensively for vague declamation and for personal abuse . The corner orator sel , dom indulges in vituperation . His great strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a dynamic force that make strong men tremble . His memory is phenomenal . He has at his finger ends the number of children in New England and the North Atlantic States between the ages of six and eleven who suffer from adenoids ; the value in millions of dollars of the Columbia River salmon catch under the first Administration of Grover Cleveland as compared with the period since the Spanish-American War ; the percentage of decrease in our importation of German cotton goods and Scotch herrings ; the annual expenditure on army and navy since 1905 , the rise in . New York city 's tax rate during the same period . The bystanders find it rather difficult to follow him in the details of his statistical analysis ; but they add up the value of the salmon catch on the Pacific Coast , the value of German cotton goods , the military and naval expenditure , the municipal tax rate , and the percentage of children with adenoids , and finding that the total runs up into billions they are greatly impressed . It is only in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old-fashioned oratory . Having driven the aforesaid total of billions of dollars deep into the minds of his audience , he lifts his finger again as high as it will go , and asks if any reasonable person can entertain the slightest doubt that the only man to deal effectively with the critical state of affLirs so clearly revealed , is that sterling patriot , that man of the people , that disinterested - patriot , that undaunted champion of popular rights , that courageous , tender-hearted , steadfast patriot , who has always - been on the side of the people against the Trusts , who was born and brought up in the district , and who can confidently be expected to see to it that the national heritage of liberty and equality shall be perpetuated ? William Smith . Sometimes the circle of small boys begins to cheer before the orator pronounces the name of William J. Smith .

In this manner the the diagonal corners wards ten o'clock most of the small boys have been discovered in the crowd by anxious parents , and led off protesting .
