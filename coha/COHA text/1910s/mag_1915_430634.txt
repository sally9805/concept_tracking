 | She lived a solitary , an almost eremitical life , utterly secluded from the contact , and almost from the knowledge , of the great world . No isolation in America today could be quite so complete as that of a lady in a French provincial town a hundred years ago : the same quiet waysides , the same faces at the same corners , the same seasons in their eternal change , the bell of centuries tolling a monotonous succession of births , marriages , and deaths . The varied doings of mankind in hasty cities , kings crowned and uncrowned , new thoughts , new fashions , new vices , new beauty , echoed in that tranquil dwelling , like the far passage of some martial pageant stirring a dream . " Two visits , two letters written , one received , fill a day , " she says ; " fill a day full for us . " She did not complain of the solitude , she loved it : She was born in it , grew up in it , and wished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend to her . Old sunlit walls caressed her with a touch like love 's . " I could take a vow to remain here forever , " she says . " No place could be to me so much my home . " The habit of loneliness grows on her , as all our habits do , until one day , returning to a house quite empty , she exclaims , " You can not think how gaily I took possession of this abandoned dwelling . Here I am alone , absolutely alone , in a place which of itself breeds calm reflection . I hear the passers pass , and do not even turn my head . " In a life so unbroken little movements made a great stir . Twice she sojourned for a few weeks in Paris and she made one brief visit to a watering place in the Pyrenees . On all these occasions she was quick and wide-eyed to catch what went on about her . She responded to great scenes and notable monuments and was not incurious as to the ways of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own habits and returned with undisturbed delight to the places she had always loved . " Repose is what delights me ; not inaction , but the poised quiet of a heart that is content . " Do not imagine that her solitude meant always quiet , how- ever . Such outward peace perhaps fosters inward turbulence , at any rate leaves room for it . Hearts unvexed by the world 's rash hurry have tempests and revolutions and tumults all their own . How many strange soul combats go on in quiet tenements . How many fierce struggles pass unperceived and unrecorded , perhaps not worth recording , yet of immense significance to those who conquer or succumb . " All my days are alike , so far as the outer world goes , " writes Mademoiselle de Guerin ; " but with the soul 's life it is different , nothing could be more varied , more flexible , more subject to perpetual change . " Two main , essential objects of all her inner life and thought kept her in this unceasing agitation . One was her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister whom she loved and cherished . To her father she was a sympathetic companion and a faithful attendant . But Maurice was confessedly more to her than any one else . He was younger than she . She had supplied for him the place of the mother who died early . She tended him , watched over him , guided him , and when he went out into the great world , thought of him and prayed for him perpetually . He was one who well deserved such affection . Sensitive , delicate in health and in feeling , imaginative , finely touched to all the fine issues of genius , his brief life was torn and tortured by alternate aspiration and doubt , by vast dreams of what he might achieve and miserable distrust of his ability to achieve anything . He died young and left behind him a Journal recording these struggles with pathetic fidelity and one short prose poem which has wide harmonies of classic dignity and echoing grandeur , hardly surpassed by the Hyperion of Keats . Who that knows that music can ever forget it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leur lyres sur les pierres ; nmais aucun ? aucun ne J'y a oubliee . " The sister also kept a Journal . But while Maurice 's was addressed to himself or to curious posterity , hers was addressed only to him ; even after death had snatched him from her , only to him . All her inmost thoughts go there , all her hopes , all her sorrows , and to pour them out to him is the great preoccupation of her life . She can say to him things  | she can not say to others . He will understand . He has always understood . With great and with little events it is the same . A sunset walk in the fields and the death of a dear friend ? each alike must be discussed with Maurice . All the emotion each brings with it must be confided to him . Anxiety for his health , for his future , for his happiness is constantly blended with her own daily doings , the whole making a curious tissue of love , as fine and delicate as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Journal from the sister 's is a fruitful lesson in human nature . In her life everything is related to him . In his she is an element , an episode , beloved , delightful , nothing more . Her name hardly occurs in his Journal , even casually . The letters he writes to her are affectionate , and appeal for comfort when he needs it . He was the sun of her life . In his , even before his marriage , she was only a tranquil star , shining quietly , treasured , but not always remembered . She knew this . Love always knows . Looking back , after he was gone , she wonders if she did not sometimes bore him . When she had him with her , the longed for letters used to come , not always bringing what she demanded of them . " How my fingers burned to open those letters in which at last I was to see you . I have seen you , but I do not know you . You open only your head to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inmost of your being , what makes your life , that I hoped to see . " No lack of response made any difference in the sister 's ardent affection , however , unless perhaps to increase the ardor , as sometimes happens in this inconsequent world . Eugenie 's thought was ever on the beloved object , on his reading , on his thinking , on his material welfare , on his varied failures and successes in his efforts to overcome the maddening poverty which hampered his progress . Yet how strange are the vagaries of the human heart . With all her passionate thought and affection , I do not find that she gave much heed to the one interest which was positive in Maurice 's life , his desire to achieve enduring beauty for the delight of men . When a life is devoured by this longing , it measures all things and all people by their sympathy with it and contribution to it . It is perhaps just here that Eugenie failed to evoke the entire response she  | looked for from her brother 's heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after his death , she expressed great interest and some enthusiasm , yet even then her chief anxiety was that he should not be misrepresented , misunderstood , mispraised as pagan rather than Christian , and she did not hesitate to assert that he had no thought of glory and did not desire it . How even our most unselfish love is absorbed in its own point of view ! How hard it is to love others as they would be loved , not as we would be loved ! Eugenie worried perpetually about Maurice 's soul , but very little about his reputation . She had not learned the profound truth and beauty of Madame de Choiseul 's remark : " I have always had the vanity of those I love : that is my fashion of loving . " I wonder whether the young wife from the far Indies , whom Maurice married when death was already beginning to lay its hand on him , had any more sympathy with his ambitions for this world . There is no evidence that she had , though she was tender and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is most curious to observe Eugenie 's feelings towards this new sister-in-law . Even for a mother , who has her own distinct , assured claim , it is hard enough to give up a son she loves . But a sister , with all a mother 's love , but only a sister 's intimacy , can not see the forming of a new and stronger bond without some dread , some repugnance , some coldness at the heart . Eugenie , like all persons who analyze their experience , was naturally inclined to doubt others ' affection because she doubted her own desert . When her friends fail to write to her , she hints her grief about it . When the tone of Maurice 's letters is indifferent , or she fancies that it is , she frets and broods over it . " Do you remember that little short letter that tormented me for a fortnight ? " How , then , did she bear the intrusion of a stranger heart , sure to see into all the hidden places where even she had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how hard it was . Her tone about the new sister might indeed seem to be all praise . She is good , she is beautiful , she is devoted to Maurice , she fulfils all her duties and is a sweet companion and friend . Nevertheless , there is  | the faintest , perfectly unintentional patronage . Her family are not , perhaps , quite all they should be . Her dress , charming , delightful , appropriate , but is it a little startling for a country town , that black velvet hat with an ostrich plume , fit to amaze earth and heaven , as a neighbor puts it ? But we do so want to be friendly with her , to do our part . " I hope Maurice will be happy with her . She is n't just the sort of woman I am used to , for character , or heart , or face . She is a stranger . I am studying her . I am trying to get her near to me , to enter into her life , if she can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soothing the last hours of the beloved one , Eugenie has nothing but praise and affection for her sister-in-law . But who could miss the poignancy of her quiet remark that she lies awake all night and hears the wife ministering to the husband as she herself would like to minister ? It is hard to tell which is more significant , this comment or that of a few weeks earlier : " They are happy . Maurice is a perfect husband . He is worth a hundred of what he was a year ago . He told me so himself . He confides in me just as much as ever . We often talk together intimately . " On one point Maurice 's marriage was as satisfying as it could be , that of religion . His wife did not distract him in any way from his salvation , which would have been hard for Eugenie ; nor yet did she promote it more than the sister did , which would have been even harder . Maurice 's salvation ! That was the object of Eugenie 's daily thoughts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had him under her own motherly wing , all was well . He might perhaps have been too easily diverted , not intensely serious , as she was ; but at least his faith was firmly grounded and she sent him out into the great world , confident that he would be a white soldier of Christ always . Alas , these brothers , how they fail us ! Not that this one really failed , or sinned , or went astray . Most would have thought him virtuous enough , Christian enough . But he took a certain interest in the heresies of his adored teacher , Lamennais , and , to the half-cloistered sister at any rate , he appeared much tainted with the follies and incredulities of an unbelieving age . How she longed to have him back with her , at least in  | page deleted  | other . To one object she addressed herself almost as freely as to the other , and it was matter of regret to her that she did not quite : " I speak as I please to this little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it everything , thoughts , griefs , pleasures , feelings , everything but what can be told only to God , and even then I am sorry to leave anything at the bottom of the box . " After her brother 's death , she recognizes , in a wonderful passage of self-analysis , the huge , the overmastering power of earthly affection , yet at once her permanent instinct blends God with it all in a complete , supreme effort of submission to His will . " Shall we never be rid of our affections ? Neither grief , nor anguish , nor death has power to change us . To love , always to love , to love right down into the grave , to love the earthly remnants , to love the body that has borne the soul , even though the soul has fled to heaven h e a v e n ! All happiness is dead for me on earth . I have buried my heart 's life . I have lost the charm of my existence . I can not tell all that my brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him all my happiness . My future , my hopes , my old age , all were one with his , and then he was a soul that understood me . He and I were two eyes in one forehead . Now we are torn apart and God has come between us . His will be done . " In emphasizing this divine possession of Mademoiselle de Guerin , we must not , however , imply that she was actually unbalanced , or not alive to the common needs and duties of daily life . Her religion was active as well as passive . Even in the more ecstatic rites of spiritual devotion she recognizes a wholesome practical efficacy , as in her striking remark about confession . " What ease , what light , what strength come to me every time I say right out , I was at fault . ' " Such a normal attitude makes one regret more than ever that , in our day , at any rate , those make most use of confession who have very little to confess . In the wide practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was especially active . Yet here too it is evident that she gave not only money but the comfort and the sage , kindly counsel which are worth much more than money , whenever occasion called for them .  | So with domestic pursuits . Though her family were of old , high standing , they were poor , lived simply , kept few attendants , and the daughters of the house were wont to turn their prudent hands to every sort of service . Eugenie had evidently been trained in the methods of careful French housekeeping . She dusts , she mends , she lays the table , she cooks , in emergency she takes the linen to the brook and washes it after the picturesque , muscular European fashion . She finds pleasure in all these doings , also , has a true domestic sense of order and finish and propriety . Nay , she does her washing with real lightness of heart , seeing charms in it which perhaps escape the average laundress . " It is a real joy to wash , to see the fish swim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the leaves , the blossoms floating in the stream . The brook brings so much that is pretty to the toiler who knows how to see . " But even here we note that the toiler 's thoughts were not wholly on her toil , however well she might perform it . She was not born to labor with contented indifference . Her heart was too restless , too eager , too bent on vast reveries beyond the limits of this world 's cleanliness . Therefore she willingly lets her sister be housekeeper and only stands ready to help when needed . If little tasks absorb too much of her time , she complains , almost petulantly . " I have hardly opened a book today . My time has been passed with things quite different from reading , things nothing in themselves , not even worth mentioning , yet which fill up every moment . " And always , through the humblest of such tasks , runs the glowing current of those thoughts which to her were the only reality in a world of tawdry , trivial , incoherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thinks only of Saint Catherine of Sienna , who had a taste for cooking . " It gave her so many subjects for meditation . I can well believe it , if for nothing but the sight of the food and the little burns one gets , which make one think of Purgatory . " For she was thinking , of hell , and purgatory , and heaven all the time , or as I said in beginning , more justly , she was thinking of God , which included them all three , and far more . God entered into every step she took , and every breath she breathed .  | We may trace Him in all her earthly affections . They were deep and strong . We have seen that in regard to Maurice . It was just as true in regard to all others . Her father she cherished tenderly . She knew that he depended on her for everything and she was ready to give him everything at any moment . The deepest workings of her soul she kept from him , because she knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering them even with a certain duplicity she only practiced the precept of one who had penetrated the spiritual life as deeply as she , though from a different angle , " The law of love is higher than the law of truth . " Her friendships for other women , also , were profoundly sincere and lasting . She gives much and asks little , just tenderness shown in a brief letter or a fleeting word . Who has analyzed the passing of friendship more delicately than she ? " It is said that women never love each other . I do not know . There may be deep affections that last only a short time . But I have always mistrusted these , for myself and for those I love . Nothing is sadder than a bit of death in the heart . Therefore , when I see an affection dying , I set to work to rekindle it with all my power . " Hers also is this perfect expression of a heart inclined to tenderness : " Our affections are born one of another . " Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was first . The thought of Him sanctified them . The sense of his presence enhanced and beautified them . Except as they turned toward Him , they could not live and did not deserve to live . " The tenderest affections of the heart , what are they , if they are not bent towards heaven , if they are not offered up to God ? They are as mortal as ourselves . We should love not for this world , but for another . " As with human love , so is it for Eugenie with all other phases of the inner life . By nature she had keen intellectual instincts , liked to read , liked to think , would even have been inclined to think with broad audacity . She had eminently the habit of reflection and analysis which makes solitude fruitful , and also makes it dangerous . What scholar could express the charm of lonely hours with more depth and delicacy than this slightly tutored girl ? " I love to linger over my thoughts , to  | bend over each one and breathe its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Books are a refuge , a resource , a consolation to her . She hates to leave them , even for the brief journeys she is called upon to make . Also , the very interesting catalogue of her limited bookshelf contains some authors of distinctly profane persuasion whom she does not always avoid . Victor Hugo fascinates her . Sometimes , indeed , the quality of the text forces her to confine her attention to the pictures , but again she is wrapt by the adventures of Jean Valjean and the flamboyant mediaevalism of Notre Dame de Paris . She tries to break a long day by an exciting novel , picks The Chamber of Poisons for its title , but finds only disappointment , pet toads , Jesuits turned into hobgoblins , big names in petty places . She has no taste for poisons , she says . Or again , she turns to Sainte-Beuve 's Volupte , having been assured by her confessor that pure minds may pass untainted through strange regions . She likes the book , not perhaps wholly fathoming its depths of morbid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him once , is delighted , and means to read more . Now what could be further apart than the worlds of Moliere and Eugenie de Guerin ? But , in the main , she reads the writers of this world only to condemn them . Bossuet , Pascal , the Fathers , the Imitation , are her daily and nightly company . Such books are all that Christians should read or even recognize . As for the general diffusion of book-learning and education , she deplores it with the real obscurantism of medi2eval superstition . The peasants , she says , were once simple-minded , earnest , reverent , devout . Now they go to school , they read the newspapers , they acquire the superficial jargon of modern education , and as a consequence they are atheistic in their talk and immoral in their lives . The same intense and constant preoccupation with the mystical point of view that affected Mademoiselle de Guerin 's intellectual pursuits entered into her aesthetic enjoyments . Art in its technical form was completely out of her world . She probably saw pictures with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal ; and churches to her were churches , not in any way creations of architectural skill . Music alone  | she approaches with a sort of groping sense of its vast emotional possibilities . But as to these she would undoubtedly have agreed with Cowper that all music not directly intended and employed for the worship of God was corrupting , enervating , debasing . " Oh , if I knew music ! " she cries , in a moment of enthusiasm . " They say it is so good for the disorders of the soul . " Yet it does not touch her . " Nothing in the world has such power to move and stimulate the soul . I know it , but I do not feel it . " And a similar experience calls forth words profoundly characteristic for more than music . " I listened to wonders , yet nothing astonished me . Is there then no astonishment save in heaven ? " But there was one region of beauty in which Eugenie 's soul opened and flowered with the most exquisite delicacy and sensibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtle , dreamy , suggestive landscape of France , which has meant so much to poets and painters , has rarely been felt or rendered with more perfection than by this simple girl who spent her life with flowers and birds and winds and clouds and stars . " I tried to begin a letter to you yesterday , " she says , " but I could not write . All my soul was at the window . " How often her soul was at the window , all ears , all eyes , stirred to wild joy or grief by the breath of light airs , or the dance of blossoms in sunshine , or the drift of autumn leaves . Now it is fair spring weather that delights her , now it is the long and wind-swept rains of autumn . The vast tranquility of summer nights at times befits her mood . And again she welcomes the tumult of great storms and cries out for even thunder to jar the too monotonous quiet . Not the heart of Keats or Shelley was more vividly , more blissfully or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sights , or unknown odors that vanish as quickly as they come . She reads Bernardin de St. Pierre 's description of the strawberry vine , which , he says , would make matter for a volume , with all it relations and experiences . " I , " she says , " am like the strawberry vine , bound up with earth and air and sky , with the birds , with so many things , visible and invisible , that I should never get through describing them , without counting what lives hidden in the folds of my heart , like the  | insects that dwell in the thickness of a leaf . " And again , " I wish my heart did not feel the condition of the air and of the seasons so much that it opens and closes like a flower with cold or sun . I do n't understand it , but so it is , while the soul is incased in this frail habitation of the body . " But nature is never all to her , never enough for her . She must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and beauty of it all , hears His voice in the breeze and in the storm , Feels His hand in the motion of flowers and of stars , or she turns away from the beauty of earth as too apt to distract From the beauty of heaven . " The sky today is pale and languid like a fair face after a fever . This look of languor is full of charm . The blending of greenness and decay , of flowers that open with flowers that fall , of singing birds and creeping brooks , the breath of storm and May sunshine mingled , give an effect of fine fabrics ruffled and tossed together , of sad and sweet at once , which fills me with delight . But this is Ascension day : let us leave earth and earth 's skies ; let us rise above our fragile dwelling place and follow where Christ has gone before us . " In another mood the quiet , subtle sounds of night seem to penetrate devotion with an overpowering tenderness , to waft thought higher even than meditation undisturbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still hear the crickets , the streamlet , and the nightingale , just one , which sings , sings , sings , in the thick darkness . What a perfect accompaniment to evening prayer . " I said in beginning that Mademoiselle de Guerin had no active personal life of her own . This is as true of her perhaps as of any of us . She followed the thought of others and of God , as the shadow follows the sun . At the same time , she was human , she was a woman , she was made of earth , as we all are . It is a study of exceeding interest to watch the stirrings of humanity , even barely perceptible and quickly crushed , in this white , pure vessel filled with the glow of an unearthly adoration . Revolt she seems to have none , doubt none , or only such momentary dimming of the pure flame as serves to make it shine the brighter . It does indeed trouble her a little to reflect that just those consolations which the poor need are given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life , she says , seems inside out and upside down , which was the view of Prometheus and of Satan , but in Mademoiselle de Guerin it does not strike us as Satanic . Also , her questioning of the divine order goes so far as a regret that she can not have her doves in heaven . But this pulls her up with a shock , for in heaven we shall regret nothing ? not even doves . Some shreds of human frailty , some lingering hints of impatience and irritability and nerves , we are pleased to find that even this saint shares with us . How subtly and charmingly does she analyze them herself . " I am not in the mood to write or to do anything amiable : quite the contrary . There are days when the soul shuts itself up like a hedgehog . If you were here , how I would prick you . " And again , in a little different phase : " I am most unsuccessful in dealing with difficulties , and am always in too great a hurry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , I wonder whether her friends really got near her and felt at ease with her . Monsieur Anatole France speaks charmingly of la douceur imperieuse des saintes . Had Mademoiselle de Guerin 's infinite gentleness sometimes a touch of the imperious ? I can hardly prove it . It is rare and subtle and indefinable . But I divine it ? a little . She remarks , with beatific triumph , " I speak to everybody I love of the things of eternity . " She did . And it seems merely prophetic despair to imply that the things of eternity might grow tiresome . But in this world we are only contented with eternal change . There are some special things of absorbing interest to most women . Eugenie de Guerin was a woman . Did she take no interest in these things ? Beauty , for instance ? It does not appear that she had any special charm of feature or carriage . Was she aware of this ? Did it trouble her ? If so , she seldom shows it . Yet there are words here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , she says , she desired passionately to be beautiful , because she was told that if she were so , her mother would love her more . But as she grows older , she thinks only of beauty of the soul . Nevertheless , coming age seems to afflict her with suggestions of ugliness , not of the soul only .  | Dress again . Fair women employ it to enhance beauty , others to create it . Did Eugenie give no thought to what she should put on ? Not much , I confess , beyond an exquisite sense of neatness and good order . Yet here , too , if you watch closely , you get a gleam of human vanity , like the flash of a spangle on a sombre floor . She looks back and reviews the preoccupations of her youth , long since laid aside and forgotten , she says . " Dolls , toys , birds , butterflies I cherished , pretty and innocent fancies of childhood . Then books , talk , jewels and ornaments a little , dreams , fair dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If she had written one , would there have been men in it , fairy lovers such as girls dream , an ideal blend of manly beauty and mad tenderness ? Ve do not know , but here again little things make us suspect . She tells us she does not like novels because the passions are let loose in them ? but she reads them . She pities souls in purgatory because of the terrible impatience with which they await release . What expectation on earth can compare with it ? she says . Not that of fortune , or of glory , or of anything else that makes the human heart pant , unless perhaps it be the longing of the beloved waiting for the lover . And elsewhere she draws a domestic picture of quiet happiness , a little house in the fields , with cows and poultry , and someone , whom ? Not a peasant , she says , like ours who beat their wives . " Do you remember ? ? " But she stops there and does not give the name . In such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she does not mention them here , she does elsewhere , often , with all a born mother 's tenderness . How charming is her dream of how she would rear them and teach them . " If I had a child to bring up , how gently I would do it , how merrily , with all the care one gives a delicate flower . I would speak to them of God with words of love . I would tell them that he loves them even more than I do , that he gives them everything I give them , and besides , the air , the sun , and the flowers , that he made the sky and the beautiful stars . " When Maurice 's child is about to be born , after the father 's death , she cries out in ecstasy , " How I long to have a baby in  | the house , to play mother , and nurse it , and caress it . " Surely the real woman is speaking to us here . Other feminine affairs were of less interest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . General society she shunned , and no doubt lost by doing so . Occasionally she is tricked out and led to a party where she thinks everyone remarks her ill , unaccustomed manner of dancing , the truth probably being that no one noticed her at all . She might certainly have been successful in conversation , for she had wit , refinement , distinction , and was capable of vivacity . But she avoided what she calls the world , with a suggestion of inexpressible disdain , alleging to herself that it was futile , frivolous , and unprofitable . Perhaps a good part of the reason was that she herself was proud and shy and essentially a spiritual aristocrat . " Books are my intellectual passion ; but how few there are that I like . It is just so with people . I rarely meet anyone that pleases me . " When you frequent the world in that spirit , it is indeed unprofitable . One phase of human weakness did take hold of this celestial wanderer and even threaten to disturb her saintly peace , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , subdues it , disclaims it . But no one could take such nice care of expression as she does , could turn sentences so daintily , so vigorously , so effectively , and not take pride in them . She is like Saint Francois de Sales , who announces the loftiest contempt for poor words , but uses the most cunning skill to get all he can out of them . ' Writing is almost a necessity to her , she says . She turns to her pen as outlet for all the struggles and trials and passions of her inner life . " Writing is the sign that I am alive , as that of a brook is running . " She looks to publication , too , makes delicate verses and sends them to a review , which she thinks will print them , if it prints women 's verses at all . Not that she cares for the public , oh , no ! She writes only to please a friend or two , who can appreciate her . And her name must not be used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subtle charm in all this newspaper notoriety , you can hardly call it glory , which does appeal , even to the saints . Then she thinks it appeals too much . All earthly glory is  | page deleted  | bore her . She endures them and keeps a brave face because God bids , but the ennui is there just the same . Nor is it only ennui . She sees a vast amount of positive evil in life . " Pessimism is half of saintliness , " says an excellent authority . It was at least half of Mademoiselle de Guerin 's . Besides general suffering and poverty and cruelty and neglect , she has a set of individual troubles , which seem avoidable , some doubt as to her own salvation and very considerable doubt as to the salvation of others . These things keep dark clouds over her , until the sun has hard work to break through . She speaks perpetually of graves and death , always , to be sure , to draw a moral lesson from them ; but can not moral lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet , Donne , while expressing a preference for the grave , found other matters more attractive still . " I hate extremes , yet I had rather stay With graves than cradles to wear out a day . " But Mademoiselle de Guerin is more than " half in love with easeful death " and inclines to woo him with all the strange fancies of Constance in King John , " Hyppolite talks to me of Marie , of another world , of his grief , of you , of death , of all the things I love so much . " One is disposed to break in on a strain so morbid and abnormal with reminders of " earthlier happy is the rose distilled , " or with the somewhat brutal Philistinism of Horace Greeley 's comment on his dear friend , Margaret Fuller , " A good husband and two or three bouncing babies would have emancipated her from a good deal of cant and nonsense . " But , though Mademoiselle de Guerin might herself have been happier as a normal wife and mother , she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exquisite soul . Let us hope that she now enjoys in perfection that celestial ecstasy which she tasted here at moments and for which she was willing to overlook and abandon every good that earthly life can afford .
