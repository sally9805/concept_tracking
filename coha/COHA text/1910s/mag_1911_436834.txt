LEE had , of course , a liberal education , though we do not know much of his early studies . Those pursued at West Point were largely technical ; but before going to that institution he must have had a good grounding in the classics , for long after , when he was President of Washington College , he used to visit the Greek classes and astonish the students by his familiarity with that language . His general ideas as to educational matters were both broad and solid . During his presidency , while sustaining as far as possible the old traditions of culture , he seems to have taken decided steps in modern directions , that is , toward practical training and individual development , ? steps which meant far more in the South than in the North . ' Nothing , ' he wrote after the war , will compensate us for the depression of the standard of our moral and intellectual culture . ' And again , ' The education of a man or woman is never completed till they die . ' If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better able to judge whether he had literary gifts . As it is , his only bit of formal writing is the brief sketch prefixed to his father 's autobiography . Here , as in so many other things , we see curiously the inheritance of the eighteenth century , its dignified finish , its determination to clothe even common things in lofty phraseology . The elder Lee takes cold because ' a slight , but driving snow which was falling , insinuated itself among the wrappings encircling his throat . ' Where it is more appropriate this breadth of expression often attains to real beauty and grandeur , as in some of the addresses and general orders to the army . ' Soldiers ! You tread with no unequal step the road by which your fathers marched through sufferings , privations , and blood to independence . Continue to emulate in the future , as you have in the past , their valor in arms , their patient endurance of hardships , their high resolve to be free , which no trial could shake , no bribe seduce , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowned their efforts with success will , in His own good time , send down his blessing upon yours . ' The reports , and especially the despatches written in the field , contain no such literary effort . They are terse and clear , saying what is needed , and only what is needed . The familiar letters are less successful as mere writing . They are loose and hasty , and not always correct in grammar and syntax . They are charming , however , when they show the intimate character of the man , and they have often a peculiar grace and playfulness which prove that , serious and earnest as he was , Lee had a keen sense of the comic side of life . ' Would you like to hear of Dick 's apparel ? A little short-sleeved , short-waisted , short-skirted , brown linen coat , well-acquainted with the washboard , and intended for a smaller man than our friend ; a faded blue calico shirt ; domestic cloth pants ; a pair of commodious brogans ; and a hat torn , 501 502 THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , hear him laugh , as he presents himself for a dance , arms akimbo , and you have him before you . . . . He complains bitterly of his present waste of life , looks thin and dispirited , and is acquainted with the cry of every child in Iowa . ' In spite of his deep respect for education , I do not find that Lee had any great love for books or for things purely intellectual . In later years he expressed his lifelong regret that he had not completed his classical education ( in which , however , he had a respectable scholarship ) before going to West Point ' ; and he thanks Worsely for the translation of the Odyssey , in terms which indicate pleasure in the perusal of the original . Among English authors he is said to have been partial to Macaulay , especially the essays , which can hardly be called the mark of a literary temperament , and in writing of his father he once quotes Burke . But it is really remarkable that in so varied and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature , even in its historical aspects . This seems the more curious when we turn to the letters of Harry Lee ? surely as much a man of action as his son ? and find a spirit keenly alive to literary questions , ready to criticize Racine and to delight in Sophocles . So with science . In Lee 's army the soldiers discussed Darwin , and concluded that ' Marse Robert ' was sufficient proof that man was not descended from apes . But I find no evidence that Lee himself ever gave a thought to the vast speculations that were unhinging the world . Perhaps it is worth while to refer in this connection to Mrs. Putnam 's shrewd remark that the Southern slave-holding planter was almost obliged in self-defense to adopt this attitude toward all modern ideas . Even as to his profession , there is no record of Lee 's making it a passionate study . He stood well at West Point , and results would certainly indicate that he did more . But nothing is mid of his ever spending feverish days and nights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battles of Napoleon . Nor do I see that he was in any way sensitive to aesthetic pleasures . While one child assiduously tickled his toes and another narrated the story of The Lady of the Lake , he would occasionally break in with the recitation of long passages of the poem , disconcerting the narratress and boring the tickler . This shows that he liked the poetry of Scott . ( Mark Twain , by the way , believed that Scott 's false chivalry was largely responsible for the Civil War . ) But of other poetry no mention and no trace . I do not remember that the name of Shakespeare occurs once in all he wrote . Novels he disapproved of , as many of us do ? for others . ' Read history , works of truth , not novels and romances . Get correct views of life , and learn to see the world in its true light . It will enable you to live pleasantly , to do good , and , when summoned away , to leave without regret . ' The world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were no novels in it . With painting and with music it is as with poetry . Lee may have enjoyed such things , but he makes no mention of his enjoyment . The nineteenth century had one aesthetic delight peculiarly its own , the appreciation of the beauty of nature . This seems to have made somewhat more of an appeal to Lee ; yet even here his language certainly gives no indication of ecstasy . A quiet Virginia farm , life in the fields and woods rather than in cities , pleased him best ? that is all . ' You do not know how much 1 have missed you and the children , my dear Mary . To be alone in a crowd is very solitary . In the woods I feel sym- pathy with the trees and birds , in whose company I take delight , but experience no pleasure in a strange crowd . ' I enjoyed the mountains as I rode along . The views are magnificent ? the valleys so beautiful , the scenery so peaceful . What a glorious world Almighty God has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how we labor to mar his gifts . ' In short , the bent of Lee 's character was absolutely moral and practical . It is not to be inferred from this , however , that he was a man of no passions , or that his staid decorum resulted from a lack of sensibility . Longstreet thought his weakness as a general was an excessive fury of combat . At any rate , there is plenty of evidence that he had a good hot temper which came to the surface on provocation . Colonel Venable says , ' No man could see the flush come oPer that grand forehead and the temple veins swell on occasions of great trial of patience , and doubt that Lee had the high , strong temper of a Washington . ' He disliked very much to have officers with a grievance allowed to make their way to him . At times this would happen , however . Immediately after one such occurrence ' General Lee came to the adjutant 's tent with flushed face , and said warmly , " Why did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me show my temper ? " ' In the same way he had a great dislike to reviewing army communications , ' and his aides spared him when they could . On one occasion Colonel Taylor had made matters as easy as possible ; but the general ' was not in a very pleasant mood ; something irritated him and he manifested his ill-humor by a little nervous twist or jerk of the neck and head , accompanied by some harshness of manner . ' Taylor became impatient and showed it ; whereupon the general said , ' Colonel Taylor , when I lose my temper , do n't let it make you angry . ' It is a curious coincidence that one of Lee 's few violent explosions of wrath occurred when he found an artilleryman brutally abusing a horse , and that one of the rare recorded outbreaks of Grant was owing to the same cause . It was a propos of Grant also that Lee once spoke sharply after the war , although not in the connection we should expect . One of his university faculty had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' said Lee , ' if you ever presume again to speak disrespectfully of General Grant in my presence , either you or I will sever his connection with this University . ' A particularly interesting example of Lee 's indignation , because we see it , as it were , bursting forth and passing at once under control , is his reference to the desecration of Arlington . ' Your old home , if not destroyed by our enemies , has been so desecrated that I can not bear to think of it . I should have preferred it to have been wiped from the earth , its beautiful hill sunk , and its sacred trees buried , rather than to have been degraded by those who revel in the ill they do for their own selfish purposes . You see what a poor sinner I am , and how unworthy to possess what was given me ; for that reason it has been taken away . ' It was by considerations of this nature that Lee dominated his passions and secured the high temperance and triumphant control which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was no less a spiritual grace than a moral victory . Here again the resemblance to Grant is striking . Every one knows Grant 's quiet comment when someone prefaced a dubious story with the familiar remark , ' I believe there are no ladies present . ' No , but there are gentlemen . ' It is said of Lee also , ' I dare say no man ever offered to relate a story of questionable delicacy in his presence . 504 THE SPIRITUAL LIFE OF ROBERT E. LEE His very bearing and presence produced an atmosphere of purity that would have repelled the attempt . ' Evidence of Lee 's supreme self-control in other directions is hardly needed . The final disaster , surely as overwhelming as could befall a man , did not break his calm or wring from him a complaint except for others . In good and evil fortune alike he strove to maintain the same stoical ? or no , I should say , as he would have wished , Christian ? fortitude . A striking instance of this is narrated by Taylor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something similar is told of Stuart , of Cox on the Union side , and may remain untold of many a private soldier in the armies of the Potomac and of Northern Virginia . It is none the less noble and beautiful in Lee . ' At the usual hour he summoned me to his presence to know if there were any matters of army routine upon which his judgment and action were desired . The papers containing a few such cases were presented to him ; he reviewed and gave his orders in regard to them . I then left him , but for some cause returned in a few moments , and with accustomed freedom entered his tent without announcement or ceremony , when I was startled and shocked to see him overcome with grief , an open letter on his knees . That letter contained the sad intelligence of his daughter 's death . . . . His army demanded his first thought and care ; to his men , to their needs , he must first attend , and then he could surrender himself to his private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared as self-control in great matters , showed in little as exactness , system , accuracy . It is said that in his youth his mother taught him rigid economy ; and throughout life he continued to practice it . He was as scrupulously punctual as Washington , for himself and for others . When young men called on his daughters , he began his locking up exactly at ten o'clock and the callers were expected to take notice . A member of his faculty once came to his office and asked for a certain paper . Lee told him where it could be found . Afterwards he said to him , ' Did you find the paper ? ' Yes , General . ' Did you return it to the place where you found it ? ' Yes , General . ' Mrs. Lee said of her husband that ' he could go , in the dark , and lay his hand on any article of his clothing , or on any particular paper , after he had once arranged them . ' This minuteness seems to have been inborn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' His specialty was finishing up . . . . He drew the diagrams on a slate ; and although he well knew that the one he was drawing would have to be re roved to make room for another , he drew each one with as much accuracy and finish , lettering and all , as if it were to be engraved or printed . ' The biographer quotes this as an admirable trait ; but I have my doubts . A high authority has said , ' Never finish a thing after it is done . ' And I am inclined to think that a prime attribute of greatness is disregarding the unnecessary . In commanding the Army of Northern Virginia for three years , Lee must have sacrificed a world of intellectual if not moral scruples , and it is the more remarkable in him , since he certainly had the germs of what is sarcastically termed the New England conscience . Imagine Cromwell or Napoleon , shortly after such a battle as Gettysburg , writing the following : ' I have been much exercised as to how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for assessors and gatherers in vain . I have sent to find collectors in the counties where I have been , without success . I wish to pay the amount as a matter of right and conscience , and for the bene- // fit of the State , but can not accomplish . . . In addition , I own three horses , a watch , my apparel , and camp equipage . . . . See if you can find someone that can enlighten you as to what I am to pay . ' The same self-control , precision , economy of resource , marked Lee in speech as in other things . There is no abandon in his letters , no freedom , no outpouring , and this unquestionably makes them somewhat colorless . So with his reports . He avoids the first person , wherever possible , and says , ' It was decided , ' It was thought best . ' How different this from the vivacity of Hooker or Sherman . Very rarely does he use brusque expressions : ' It may be only a Yankee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His Grant 's talent and strategy consists in accumulating overwhelming numbers . ' Even his recorded conversations contain little that seems like unrestrained confidence . Thus one is startled when one finds him reported as saying , ' I have never understood why General Sherman has been commended for that march , when the only question was whether he could feed his army by consuming all the people had to eat . ' And the tone of his remarks to Badeau is even more unusual : ' He spoke very bitterly of the course of England and France during the war , and said that the South had as much cause to resent it as the North ; that England especially had acted from no regard to either portion of the Union , but from a jealousy of the united nation and a desire to see it fall to pieces . England , he said , had led the South to believe she would assist them , and then deserted them when they most needed aid . ' Bancroft speaks admirably of ' the onderful power of secrecy of Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the impression that he knew more than he was willing to utter , but Washington seemed to have said all that the occasion required . ' Lee , I think , resembled Washington in this and had an excellent faculty , when he was interrogated , of seeming to say much and saying little . Thus he answered a question about McClellan , ? ' I have always entertained a high opinion of his capacity , and have no reason to think that he omitted to do anything that was in his power . ' And when one of his officers tried to draw him out by speaking rather freely about another , Lee answered , ' Well , sir , if that is your opinion of General ? , I can only say that you differ very widely from the general himself . ' Reserve of this character is always liable to be misinterpreted , and so we get what foundation there is for Badeau 's charge of duplieity . His complaint of this in reference to Lee 's reports seems rather absurd , for the unhappy necessities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from veracity . But Badeau also criticizes Lee 's last correspondence with Grant , probably read and reread as much as any letters ever written in the world . To accuse Lee of intentional deception in any of these is preposterous ; but the letter especially singled out by Badeau , that of April 8 , 1865 , is certainly not direct , simple , and straightforward , any more than is the other important letter in which Lee discusses Jackson 's share in the tactics of Chancellorsville . So far as Lee 's reserve is concerned , however , it must not in any way be attributed to haughtiness or aristocratic superiority . It is true that he , like Washington , found it difficult to throw off his dignity , to mingle freely with his fellows in common intercourse ; but there never was a man who believed more heartily in American liberty , in the absolute equality of all men before 506 THE SPIRITUAL LIFE OF ROBERT E. LEE the law and before God , who would have more entirely accepted Mr. H. D. Sedgwick 's noble definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of lowering : Democracy is the belief that our highest pleasures are increased by sharing them . ' Lee hated parade , display , and ceremony , hated above all things being made an object of public gaze and adulation . His idea of high position was high responsibility ; a superior was simply one who had larger duties , and the mark of a gentleman was a keen sense of the feelings and susceptibilities of others . No one has ever expressed this attitude more delicately then he himself , in a memorandum found among his papers after his death . ' The forbearing use of power does not only form a touchstone , but the manner in which an individual enjoys certain advantages over others is a test of a true gentleman . The power which the strong have over the weak , the magistrate over the citizen , and employer over the employed , the educated over the unlettered , the experienced over the confiding , even the clever over the silly ? the forbearing or inoffensive use of all this power or authority , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will show the gentleman in a plain light . The gentleman does not needlessly and unnecessarily remind an offender of a wrong he may have committed against him . He can not only forgive , he can forget ; and he strives for that nobleness of self and mildness of character which impart sufficient strength to let the past be but the past . A true man of honor feels humbled himself when he can not help humbling others . ' It reminds one of Dekker 's ? The first true gentleman that ever breathed . The thing that puzzles me , as it has doubtless puzzled many , is how much personal ambition had Lee under this august reserve , this firm moderation , this constant sacrifice of self to duty . What led him into the army first ? He is reported to have said in later years , The great mistake of my life was taking a military education . ' Why did he make that mistake ? Was it merely the desire to follow his father 's profession ? Had he a love of adventure and excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of distant glory ? Glimpses of such a passion may be caught in Washington 's youthful letters . I find no trace of it in Lee 's . When his friends display anxiety for his advancement , he discourages them : ' I hope my friends will give themselves no annoyance on my account , or any concern about the distribution of favors . I know how those things are awarded at Washington , and how the President will be besieged by clamorous claimants . I do not wish to be numbered among them . ' Again : ' Do not give yourself any anxiety about the appointment of the brigadier . If it is on my account that you feel an interest in it , I beg that you will discard it from your thoughts . ' By the time the Civil War came , this indifference to honors had grown to be a fixed habit . No one can doubt the sincerity of Lee 's repeated expressions of willingness to serve in any capacity where he could be useful . It is said that when Virginia first joined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a company of cavalry . Later he observed to a restless subordinate , ' What do you care about rank ? I would serve under a corporal , if necessary . ' And to Davis he wrote , after Gettysburg , I am as willing to serve now , as in the beginning , in any capacity and at any post where I can do good . The lower in position , the more suited to my ability and the more agreeable to my feelings . ' But there is a harder test of self- // sacrifice in these matters than even the willingness to forego rank ; and that is patience under criticism . Here , too , Lee is conspicuous . To be sure , Grant asserts that his great rival was not criticized . Less than some others , perhaps , but surely enough . And I think his immunity from it was partly due to the temper in which it was received . One of the finest passages in all his letters relates to this . ' My whole time is occupied , and all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life , be it long or short , will be devoted . Tell her not to mind the reports she sees in the papers . They are made to injure and occasion distrust . Those that know me will not believe them . Those that do not will not care for them . I laugh at them . ' And laughing at them , in his own sunny , kindly way , he told B. H. Hill that the great mistake of the war was in making all the best , generals editors of newspapers . ' I am willing to serve in any capacity to which the authorities may assign me . I have done the best I could in the field , and have not succeeded as I could wish . I am willing to yield my place to these best generals , and I will do my best for the cause editing a newspaper . ' The more widely one reads in the literature of the war , the more one appreciates the greatness of Lee 's indifference to glory , his absolute freedom from jealousy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on both sides ; but one grows heartsick over the petty disputes , the ignominious wrangling which indentifies a grand cause with a little man . In many cases injured merit is only trying to get its rights and perhaps does not deserve blame . But here is precisely the hardest lesson of all . To abstain from justifying one 's self at the expense of others , when one is wrong , is not always easy . To ab stain when one feels one 's self to have been right ? that is the labor and the difficulty indeed . Even in this Lee succeeded , when so many failed . As to his love of adventure and excitement , that , also , rarely appears . All the more significant is the Fredericksburg phrase , ' It is well that war is so terrible , or else we might grow too fond of it . ' Side by side with this I like to put the quiet words , written after the war and very different from what we should expect from a soldier homesick for far-off battle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil life . ' Altogether , a man to whom the ambitions of this world meant very little . Yet it was he who wrote of his daughter , ' She is like her father , always wanting something . ' I wonder what he wanted . It is said that Darwin confessed that all he required for happiness in life was his scientific pursuits and the family affections . It might equally well be said that all Lee needed was the family affections and religion . And now , what about his religion ? Assuredly it was not a religion of sect . It was broad enough to go even beyond the bounds of Christianity and recognize earnestness of intention in those of a different creed altogether . An application of a Jew soldier for permission to attend certain ceremonies of his synagogue in Richmond was endorsed by his captain : " Disapproved . If such applications were granted , the whole army would turn Jews or Shaking Quakers . " When the paper came to General Lee , he endorsed on it , " Approved , and respectfully returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always respect the religious views and feelings of others . " ' Lee was an Episcopalian , but he had no narrow belief in the power of rituals or formulas . One of his friendly ene- 508 THE SPIRITUAL LIFE OF ROBERT E. LEE mies , General Hunt , records that at the time of the excitement over Puseyism , efforts were made in the parish to which Lee belonged to enlist him on one side or the other of the controversy . He resisted these steadily , and on one occasion , when the appeals were especially urgent , he remarked audibly to Hunt , I am glad to see that you keep aloof from the dispute that is disturbing our little parish . That is right , and we must not get mixed up in it ; we must support each other in that . But I must give you some advice about it , in order that we may understand each other : Beware of Pussyism ! Pussyism is always bad , and may lead to unchristian feeling ; therefore beware of Pussyism ! ' He seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military , some pleasant little turn of this kind , which assuaged bitterness and broadened bigotry . Thus , when a lady once complained to him that little Lenten food ? fish , oysters , and the like ? was obtainable in Lexington , he said to her , ' Mrs. ? , I would not trouble myself about special dishes ; I suppose if we abstain from special sins that is all that . will be expected of us . ' Nor was Lee 's religion a matter of dogma or theology . Some speculative doubts appear , indeed , to have beset him in his earlier years , and it is intensely curious to find the shadow of Unitarianism hinted at by one of his devout biographers as keeping him for a long time from the church . ' Although at that time , and for a score of years thereafter , his estimate of his own unworthiness , and some mistaken views of Christ , perhaps , prevented his making an avowal of the Christian faith and becoming a communicant of the church , he was , nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bible , reverence for its Author as revealed therein , reliance more or less implicit upon the Saviour , and prayer secret , but sincere . ' ( The italics are mine ) . When once these difficulties were overcome , however , his acceptance seems to have been complete and unquestioning . He liked sermons to be simple and practical . ' It was a noble sermon , one of the best I ever heard ? and the beauty of it was that the preacher gave our young men the very marrow of the Gospel . ' He liked prayers to be brief and to the point . You know our friend ? is accustomed to make his prayers too long . He prays for the Jews , the Turks , the heathen , the Chinese , and everybody else , and makes his prayers run into the regular hour for our college recitations . Would it be wrong for me to suggest to Mr. that he confine his morn-ing prayers to us poor sinners at the college , and pray for the Turks , the Jews , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' He avoided the discussion of speculative points , whenever possible . Someone asked him once whether he believed in the Apostolic succession . He said he had never thought of it ; and on another similar occasion , ' I never trouble myself about such questions ; my chief concern is to be an humble , sincere Christian myself . ' That humility is the key to this as to many other problems in Lee 's character is indisputable , ? genuine humility . Others might explain the universe and probe the mysteries of God . Surely he need not . Indeed it is recorded that he was reluctant to commit himself on any general matter of intellectual interest . ' He studiously avoided giving opinions upon subjects which it had not been his calling or training to investigate ; and sometimes I thought he carried this great virtue too far . ' Too far , perhaps . But there are so many in these days , in all days , who do not carry it far enough . I // think it is this perfect and unconscious humility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the wild doings of some of his biographers . He has no thought of his own excellences , or of intruding them upon us . No one would have shrunk more than he from being held up as a model of perfection . Even in military affairs , where he knew his ground , the humility is always obvious . ' I could not have done as well as has been done , but I could have helped and taken part in a struggle for my home and neighborhood . So the work is done , I care not by whom it is done . ' But in matters of the soul the great warrior 's self-abasement is as touching as it is manifestly sincere . As we were about to leave his tent , Mr. Lacy said , " I think it is right that I should say to you , General , that the Chaplains of the army have a deep interest in your welfare and that some of the most fervent prayers we offer are in your behalf . " The old hero 's face flushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with choked utterance and deep emotion , " Please thank them for that , sir ? I warmly appreciate it . And I can only say that I am nothing but a poor sinner , trusting in Christ for salvation , and need all of the prayers they can offer for me . " ' Lee 's religion was , therefore , mainly practical . He was most devout and constant in all religious observances , though his son does not conceal a human propensity to slumber during sermon time . He was ardent in prayer both private and public . Such a curious religious democracy as prevailed in his army has probably not been seen in the world since the days of Cromwell . On one occasion he was hurrying with his staff to battle . The firing had begun and the shells were flying . But the cavalcade happened to pass a camp-meeting where some ragged veteran was holding forth in prayer . Instantly the commander-in-chief dismounted , and he and all his officers , with bared heads , reverently took part in the simple worship . Again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1864 to meet Grant at Petersburg , Lee , with a thousand cares and duties on his shoulders , turned aside from the road and knelt in the dust beside a minister , to ask for guidance and blessing . All that I have written of Lee has indeed been written in vain , if it is necessary to point out that his religion was practical , not only in form and observance , but in the deeper touching and moulding of the heart . Perhaps the final test of this is utter and perfect forgiveness of those who have injured or are trying to injure us ; not the forgiveness of the lips ( ' I forgive you as a Christian , ' said Rowena . ' Which means , ' said Wamba , that she does not forgive him at all ' ) , but the forgiveness of broad tolerance , of perfect understanding and sympathy , that is , of love . After the war a minister expressed himself rather bitterly as to the conduct of the North . ' Doctor , ' said Lee to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Love your enemies . " . . . Do you think your remarks this evening were quite in the spirit of that teaching ? ' On another occasion a general exclaimed , ' I wish those people were all dead ! " How can you say so ? ' answered his chief . ' Now I wish they were all at home attending to their own business , and leaving us to do the same . ' And he summed up the whole matter more generally : ' I have fought against the people of the North , because I believed they were seeking to wrest from the South dearest rights . But I have never cherished bitter or vindictive feelings , and have never seen the day when I did not pray for them . ' 510 THE SPIRITUAL LIFE OF ROBERT E. LEE The belief that ' our highest pleasures are increased by sharing them ' certainly finds application more completely in religion than in anything else . No missionary ever had more ardent zeal than Lee for bringing the knowledge of God to all about him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than others , of that reaching down a saving hand from vast heights of perfection which evokes almost a perverse determination not to be saved . Here , as elsewhere , his sweet humility averts any charge of a too aggressive saintliness . ' He one day said to a friend in speaking of the duty of laboring for the good of others , " Ah , Mrs. , I find it so hard to keep one poor sinner 's heart in the right way , that it seems presumptuous to try to help others . " ' Nevertheless , one almost feels as if he cared more for winning souls than battles , and for supplying his army with Bibles than with bullets and powder . Even this solemn aspect of things he could color occasionally with the gentle sunshine of his humor , as when he remarked , on hearing that many of his soldiers were taking part in a revival , ' I am delighted . I wish that all of them would become Christians , for it is about all that is left them now . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears not only in his private talk , but in his public orders . ' The commanding general . . . directs that none but duties strictly necessary shall be required to be performed on Sunday , and that all labor , both of men and animals , which it is practicable to anticipate or postpone , or the immediate performance of which is not essential to the safety , health , or comfort of the army , shall be suspended on that day . Commanding officers . . . will give their attention to the maintenance of order and quiet around the places of worship , and prohibit anything that may tend to disturb or interrupt religious exercises . ' These might be general orders of Cromwell or of Moses . When it came to the guidance of the young at Washington College , in later years , Lee 's fervor became even more marked . ' We had been conversing for some time respecting the religious welfare of the students . General Lee 's feelings soon became so intense that for a time his utterance was choked , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his lips quivering with emotion , and both hands raised , he exclaimed , " Oh , doctor ! if I could only know that all the young men in this college were good Christians , I should have nothing more to desire . " ' You will remember that this man surrendered a great army and saw a nation sink to dust without a tear . The central fact of all religion is doubtless the personal relation to God , prayer . And it is here that I have followed Lee with the deepest interest . In our modern busy life we set God so far apart that we are in danger of losing sight of Him altogether . This springs largely from reverence . We are afraid of soiling sacred things with the dust of every day . The medieval Christian had no such timidity . God was his companion , his friend , to be called on every hour , every moment , if needed . Go back two thousand years to the sweet , simple piety of an Athenian gentleman , Xenophon , ? some call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the divine to direct his comings and goings , to cast down his enemies and support his friends . Just so Lee . God gives the victory . God permits the defeat . God sends rain to mire the Virginia roads . He sends his sunshine to make them passable again . If God is appealed to passionately enough , devoutly enough , humbly enough , we win . If we lose , it is be- // cause we have not honored God sufficiently . But ? but ? what if your cause is wrong and the other right ? What if millions on the other side are praying too , as honestly , as humbly , as zealously as you are ? To set out to kill , to pray God to help you kill those who are devoutly praying God to help them kill you ? it inevitably recalls the eternal contradiction put so vividly by the poet , For prayer the ocean is where diversely Men steer their course , each to a several coast ; Where all our interests so discordant be That half beg winds by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but war always gives them a fierce and startling significance . I trust it will be believed that I do not bring them up in any spirit of mockery . My one interest is to know what Lee thought of them . Did he meet them ? Did he consider them ? Or did he put them aside with the simple concreteness of his practical temperament ? ' I had taken every precaution to ensure success and counted on it . But the Ruler of the Universe willed otherwise and sent a storm to disconcert a well-laid plan , and to destroy my hopes . ' Does he never ask why ? ' I hope we will yet be able to damage our adversaries when they meet us . That it should be so , we must implore the forgiveness of God for our sins , and the continuance of His blessings . ' Does this never sound strange ? Apparently not ; since he repeats it , and repeats it with an inexhaustible and , I can not help adding , an at times exasperating piety . As to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it is naturally less revealed to us . That a relation to God so constant and so intimate should be turned to only for worldly advantage and material benefit is wholly unworthy of a nature so finely touched , and we must believe that the sweetest part of his religion lay in the high rapture and forgetfulness of spiritual communion . He was not one to speak of such experience , however , or to write of it . And we are only told that ' he was emphatically a man of prayer , and was accustomed to pray in his family and to have his seasons of secret prayer which he allowed nothing else ? however pressing ? to interrupt ' ; and again : ' I shall never forget the emphasis with which he grasped my hands as , with voice and eye that betrayed deep emotion , he assured me that it knowledge of prayer was not only his comfort , but his only comfort ; and declared the simple and absolute trust that he had in God and God alone . ' So I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was God . Schleiermacher said that Spinoza was God-intoxicated . It would be indecorous to speak of Lee as intoxicated with anything . But everywhere and always he had God in his heart : not so much the God of power , or the God of justice , or even the God of beauty , but the God of love , tempering the austerity of virtue , sweetening the bitterness of failure , above all breathing loving-kindness into the intolerable hell of war . There have been fierce saints who were fighters . There have been gentle saints who were martyrs . It is rare to find a soldier making war ? stern war ? with the pity , the tenderness , the sympathy of a true follower of Christ . It seems suitable to end with an anecdote , not perfectly authenticated and in some points questionable , but too characteristic of Lee to be neglected altogether . It is told by a Union soldier : ' I was in the battle of Gettysburg myself , and an incident occurred there which largely changed my views of the Southern people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fought and cursed the Confederacy desperately . I could see nothing good in any of them . The last day of the fight I was badly wounded . A ball shattered my left leg . I lay on the ground not far from Cemetery Ridge , and as General Lee ordered his retreat , he and his officers rode near me . As they came along , I recognized him , and though faint from exposure and loss of blood , I raised up my hands , looked Lee in the face , and shouted as loud as I could , " Hurrah for the Union ! " The general heard me , looked , stopped his horse , dismounted , and came towards me . I confess that I thought he meant to kill me . But as he came up , he looked down at me with such a sad expression upon his face that all fear left me , and I wondered what he was about . He extended his hand to me , and grasping it firmly and looking right into my eyes , said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . " If I live a thousand years , I shall never forget the expression of General Lee 's face . There he was , defeated , retiring from a field that had cost him and his cause almost their last hope , and yet he stopped to say words like those to a wounded soldier of the opposition who had taunted him as he passed by . As soon as the general had left me , I cried myself to sleep there upon the bloody ground . '
