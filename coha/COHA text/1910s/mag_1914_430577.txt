THE word " Colonial " has been used so carelessly to describe furniture , that to unthinking persons it often represents that made of mahogany , and in a style which did not come into existence until after the Empire . Taking the year 1776 , when the Declaration of Independence was signed , or , stretching a point , the year 1783 , when the Treaty of Peace was signed , the very last furniture that we can call " Colonial " is that of the Adam style and that inspired by the dawning taste , ? the transition between Louis XV and Louis XVI , ? when the straight line was beginning to supplant the scroll and the spiky curve that had wearied the world in their unrestful riot . Hepplewhite did not come into vogue until 1785 . Properly speaking , the Colonial period closes with Chippendale . It is evident , therefore , that we can not admit Hepplewhite , nor Shearer , nor Sheraton , much less the Empire , Post-Empire , and Early Victorian , under the term that has become altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Half Moon into the waters of Manhattan Island , and the Mayflower landed the Pilgrims on the " rockbound coast " of New England , the prevailing style of furniture in Holland was of the kind we find in the engravings of Abraham Bosse , and in Eng- land of the style that is called Jacobean , in which the influence of the Dutch is very strong . Pieces of carved oak , however , were bequeathed from generation to generation , and were even carried across the sea . Consequently , not a little " Elizabethan " furniture appears in the inventories of both northern and southern colonies , and undoubtedly served as models to native workmen for their simpler productions . ELIZABETHAN AND JACOBEAN One of these persistent types was the " court cupboard , " which took the place of the modern sideboard . Its most general form consists of a chest of three long drawers surmounted by a half-hexagon cupboard ( each of the three panels being a door ) , and the top slab supported by columns . At first this cupboard was more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was subjected to new styles of decoration , such as geometrical panels , egg- or lozenge-shaped ornaments stained black and applied , and back spindles cut in half and laid on in groups ; while the carved acorn bulbs on the columns gave way to black bulbs , or spindles . A carved oak Elizabethan chair , preserved in the Essex Institute at Salem , shows that handsome pieces were brought into the country as early as 1634 ; and when we find a " great chair " mentioned in the inventory of a comfortable house , it is more than probable that this is the kind of article that is listed . Almost a typical Tudor house was that of Governor Goodyear of Connecticut , whose inventory of 1658 shows curtained beds and innumerable hangings , cushions , curtains , and " carpets " ( table cloths , of course ) , a great chair , twelve lesser chairs , three covered chairs , a little chair , six joined stools , six stools , two plain forms , a court cupboard , a side cupboard , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , two round and two small tables , a chest of drawers , brass andirons , silver , pewter , and kitchen utensils . The " drawing table " was composed of extra leaves superimposed on lower ones , which were drawn forward . Then the top leaves fell into the space the lower leaves had made , and the slab was practically continuous . This table was supported on strong legs with great bulbs or globes , which in early days were carved , and at a later period were stained black , or picked out with black threads . At a still later date a new kind of table made its appearance , ? the " gate-legged " or " thousandlegged , " with six , eight , twelve , or even twenty legs . This table could be reduced in size by pushing some of the legs back into the frame and dropping the leaves . The legs were spirally turned , or beaded . The " gate-legged table " was so persistent a form that it lasted into the eighteenth century , and was even made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson is preserved by the Albany Institute . It is more than six feet long and five feet wide and of a deep red mahogany . It was confiscated in 1776 . MAHOGANY IN FURNITURE Mahogany was known at a much earlier period than is commonly supposed . It made its appearance even in the Age of Oak . In a curious little Spanish book published at the end of the sixteenth century a writing desk of curious marquetry is described . " How much did you pay for this escritoire ? " the questioner asks . " More than it was worth : forty ducats , " is the reply . " Of what wood is it ? " To which , the owner answers , " The red is mahogany from Havana ; this black is ebony , and this white , ivory . " When we remember with what amazing rapidity the Spanish colo- nies flourished in the West Indies and on the Spanish Main , and what numbers of ships came and went from Spain to the New World , we can be very sure that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Honduras and Santo Domingo to be made into furniture . It is more than likely that the " Spanish tables , " which appear in Elizabethan writings as articles of luxury , were of mahogany discovered by the followers of Columbus , Cortes , Pizarro , Hawkins , and other adventurers . DUTCH FURNITURE Pioneers coming into a new country would naturally bring the simplest kind of furniture , and depend upon capable hands to fell trees and knock together such articles as they needed . NTen who could build houses in the wilderness could certainly make tables and chairs ; but the first article of conditions agreed to by the city of Amsterdam and the West Indian Company is that " The colonists who are going to New Amsterdam shall be transported in suitable vessels with their families , household furniture , and other necessaries . " The early settlers from the Low Countries were , as a rule , of the poorer class ; but wealthy merchants soon emigrated , and the little town became to the Dutch in the West what Batavia had become to the Dutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequence , bringing in from the Fatherland not only streams of colonists , but merchandise of all kinds ; so that when the Dutch town , with its canals , prim gardens , and houses with " crow-stepped " gables , reached the height of its prosperity , the homes of the wealthiest citizens were filled with handsome furniture , pottery and  | porcelain , fine silver , curios from the Far East , and pictures by the Dutch masters of the time , as the inventories clearly show . The far-sighted Dutch merchants and intrepid Dutch sailors had between them almost captured the trade of the Far East ; and when the treasures of the Orient poured into Amsterdam it was only natural for the merchants to make a market in the New World for them . Therefore , the Arms of Amsterdam , the Spotted Cow , the Sea Mew , the Blue Fox , and other ships arrived with many oriental and domestic goods , and took back not only furs but woods for the skilful cabinetmakers to make up into handsome articles that sometimes crossed the ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Dutch in Holland and the Dutch on the Hudson contained identical articles , and we have only to look at the interiors of Jan Steen , Terburg , Pieter de Hooch , and other " Little Masters " to learn how the rooms of the Dutch colonists were furnished . DUTCH CABINETS In nearly every picture we notice a great kas or armoire . It is simple , ornate , painted , carved , or inlaid . Handsome porcelain usually ornaments its broad , square top . The kas is frequently mentioned in New Amsterdam inventories , and examples survive in old homes . The workmen of the Netherlands were famous for their beautiful cabinets ; and when we remember the passion the Dutch had for collecting tiny objects and curios of all kinds , it is not surprising that the piece of furniture that guarded and exhibited them should be of the utmost importance . Of course , the cabinet was always more or less a luxurious article , ? carved , inlaid , painted , or gilded , ? and its shelves and drawers were beautifully lined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was familiar in the homes of New Amsterdam and Albany . Inventories mention " a small square cabinet with brass hoops , " one " East India waxed cabinet with brass bands and hinges , with four partitions , " " East India cabinet with four black ebony feet , " etc . Inventories describe beds with curtains and valance , which shows plainly that the box-shaped bed of the Bosse engravings was used , and such beds as we see in the Dutch paintings and occasionally in museums . The Dutch also clung to the idea of the bed  | built into the panels of the room , if we may believe travelers . The table always disappeared beneath the cover or " carpet , " usually an oriental rug . The mirror , though a luxury , was not uncommon . Sometimes it was embedded in the center of the architectural chimney , unless a picture ? a sea piece , a landscape , a mythological or historical or biblical scene ? occupied this important place . Tiles , of course , framed the fireplace . Chairs were scarce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We read of oak , cane , matted , Russia leather , Spanish leather , and even ebony chairs . Stools , forms , and benches were numerous ; and the little square foot warmer with its perforated brass top , through which the warmth of the glowing embers inside could penetrate , was universal . It is safe to say that , while a great deal of good furniture was made in New Amsterdam , the handsome examples were imported , and that , with such fine pieces of cabinet work , handsome rugs and hangings , porcelain . and silver , the best type of the Dutch home in New Amsterdam had an air of elegance as well as comfort . ANGLO-DUTCH The political relations of Spain and Flanders naturally led to a great interchange of styles . During the Spanish oppression , when Alva drew his bloody sword in the Low Countries , many Flemings sought refuge in England , and carried thither their skill in carving as well as weaving , and their interpretation of the new styles of the Renaissance in design and decoration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leading spirit at Fontainebleau . The ties between Holland and England were even closer in Puritan days than they were in the " spacious times of Queen Elizabeth " ; and it must be remembered , too , that the Pilgrims brought to the New World tastes that had been tinctured by a long residence in Leyden ( ly ' - den ) .  | Dutch influence continued to strengthen and ultimately to rule in England when William III and Mary ( daughter of the Duke of York , who was just as Dutch in her tastes as he ) ascended the throne in 1689 . William and Mary transformed Hampton Court into a Dutch palace , and gave Daniel Marot ( a Huguenot , who had carried into Holland the style refugie* on the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 ) a free hand to design the furniture and decorate the rooms . Marot also worked through the short reign of Queen Anne ( 1702-1714 ) , and was responsible for the so-called " Queen Anne style , " which may be described as a transition between late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal more of the Louis XIV than the Regency is found in the Queen Anne style ; for Marot was a pupil of Lepautre . The highback chair with the heavy feet and stretchers , the high-backed sofa , the ornate mirror frames , the cabinets on stands , and the high and low case of drawers all found their way across the ocean to American colonial homes . Now we are in a position to see how hard it is to separate the English and Dutch furniture of the seventeenth century , and with what gradual steps we are led into the style of furniture that , for want of a better name , is called Anglo-Dutch . It was a period in which the curve triumphed and in which the touch of the Far East was distinctly felt . Mahogany was the wood that then  | ruled ; but there was also a rage for lacquered furniture and the cheaper " painted and japanned " imitation . Highboys , chests of drawers , desks , screens , and clock cases were made of lacquer , and not infrequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up into furniture in England . We can best follow the progress of the style in the chair . First the leg was somewhat timid in curve and ended in a hoof foot ; then it became bolder in its spring and ended in a claw-and-ball foot , and gradually the stretcher disappeared ; the jar-shaped splat in the back was at first plain , and later , when reduced in size , was perforated and carved ; the top rail became more waved and graceful ; and at length the height of elegance was reached in the famous " Chippendale " type . Another typical piece was the high case of drawers , popularly called " highboy . " This was in two parts , a variant of the chest-uponchest , double chest of drawers , etc . At first it stood on a frame of six spindle shaped legs connected with stretchers ; but this Queen Anne type was succeeded by the high case of drawers placed on a low case supported on cabriole legs . The mahogany highboy , with its brass escutcheons and key plates surmounted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite piece of the eighteenth century . So was the low case of drawers , or " lowboy , " a kind of commode used as a dressing table . These forms were so popular that many high and low cases of drawers were made in cherry , pine , and other cheap woods , stained to represent mahogany . The card table , with its claw-and-ball feet , its round depressions at the four corners for candles , and its wells for the little fish that were used for  | counters , and the tea table , with its revolving top that could be made to fall , also belong to this Anglo-Dutch period . Inventories show that the high-post bedstead was universally used , and varied were its hangings . The idea that . a " Colonial " bed was always draped in white is erroneous . We are now in the middle of the eighteenth century , and there is no sign of a sideboard ! The old court cupboard disappeared long ago ; and , strange to say , there is nothing to take its place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining room , and a long table with drawers was used as a serving table . Even Chippendale does not give us anything that suggests the useful and handsome sideboard . A " sideboard table " with a marble slab was the best that he could do . Robert Adam accompanied his sideboard table with pedestal cupboards surmounted by urns ; but we have to wait for Thomas Shearer and Hepplewhite to unite the board and the pedestals and perfect the form of the sideboard as we know it . Hence there is no such article as a " Colonial sideboard . " CHIPPENDALE The man who seemed to gather all the fashionable tastes of the day and put them into form was Chippendale , about whom until a few years ago there was so much mystery . Modern research has discovered that there were three Thomas Chippendales . The first was a carver and picture frame maker , and the great cabinetmaker and carver of St. Martin 's Lane was his son . He died in 1799 , leaving a son , Thomas , who was also a cabinetmaker ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Toward the end of his life the great Chippendale seems to have been working in harmony with the new Adam craze . Travelers were always impressed with the style and fashion they found in the centers of Colonial life . Boston , Salem , New York , Philadelphia , Annapolis , Williamsburg , and Charleston  | could show many homes of elegance , presided over by men and women of grace and culture . They kept up with the latest taste in everything , ? in clothing , in hair dressing , in silver , in china , and in furniture . They frequently sent their silver to the silversmith to be melted into the newest form , and had their looking glasses recut and refrained to harmonize with the new furniture they bought or ordered . Wealthy colonials seemed to live in horror of not keeping abreast of the times , and visitors often expressed their surprise to see that fashions from London found their way across the ocean before they would reach a country town only a few miles from Charing Cross or Temple Bar . FURNITURE MADE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imported , much of it was made in this country . From the earliest times there were numerous cabinetmakers scattered throughout the colonies , and there were many skilful artisans in the towns . The newspapers of Boston , Annapolis , and New York are full of advertisements . In 1762 , for instance , we find one John Brinner , a " cabinet- and chair-maker from London , " establishing himself at the Sign of the Chair on Broadway , and advertising exactly the kind of articles contained in Chippendale 's book . He tells us , " Every article in the Cabinet , Chair-making , Carving , and Gilding Business is enacted on the most reasonable Terms , with the utmost Neatness and Punctuality . He carves all sorts of Architectural , Gothic , and Chinese ChimneyPieces , Glass and Picture Frames , Slab Frames , Girondels , Chandeliers , and all kinds of Mouldings and Frontispieces , etc . Desks and Bookcases , Library Book Cases , Writing and Reading Tables , Study Tables , China Shelves and Cases , Commode and Plain Chests of Drawers , Gothic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chairs , Sofa-Beds , Settees , Couch and Easy Chairs , Frames , all kinds of Field Bedsteads . N. B. He has brought over from London six Artificers , well skill 'd in the above branches . " Before the middle of the century the Windsor chair had become popular , and many chair  | makers devoted themselves solely to making it in its many varieties . Styles merged into one another . The taste was changing in the height of the Chippendale period ; for the neo-classic style of the Adam brothers was captivating decorators and their patrons . In France , too , ultraclassical tendencies and the straight line show in the models by Delafosse while Louis XV was still on the throne . The doom of the curve was sealed . INFLUENCE OF THE ADAMS There is very little Adam furniture in existence ; but furniture inspired by Adam models was sent across the ocean , and was also made on this side of the Atlantic . When the hard struggle for Liberty was ended and the dark clouds were lifted , Americans were more than ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attic or to the servants ' quarters , so that they might refurnish their homes after the new French styles of Louis XVI , or in the English taste of Hepplewhite and Sheraton .  |
