Correspondence THE " OPPOSITION " OF MR . ROOSEVELT To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : So much is being made of Senator La Follette 's op  --  position to the war that the more vital division of opinion as to the uses to which American victory , when achieved , shall be put is in the way of being overlooked . There is lit  --  tle likelihood that any stop-the-war movement will be able to gain head before that victory has been achieved . There is , however , considerable likelihood that when the moment to formulate terms of peace arrives the advocates of what may be styled a " liberal " peace will find that a large section of the public mind has been hardened against their pro  --  posals as a result of activities rather less conspicuous but far more effective than those of the Senator from Wisconsin . It will be unfortunate if the moulding of public opinion against liberal ideas goes on unopposed because of distrac  --  tions caused by the so-called seditious propaganda of a few should recokn important . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to espouse what Woodrow Wilson opposes and to oppose what the President espouses , has already assumed the leadership of the only opposition which the Administration should reckon important . Mr. Wilson has stated as one of the principal aims of this country that " the world must be made safe for democracy . " Mr. Roosevelt has said more than once , but notably at Johns  --  town , Pennsylvania , on September 30 , that " we did not go to war to make democracy safe . " Mr. Wilson has stated that " we have gone into it with no special grievance of our own . " At Johnstown Mr. Roosevelt directly challenged this : " And we did go to war because we have a special grievance . We went to war because after two years during which , " and so forth . Looking to the future the President , on January 22 , announced that " only a peace between equals can last ; only a peace the very principle of which is equality and a common participation in a common benefit . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ princi  --  ple , and in his reply to the Pope he invited the German peo  --  ple to accept equality in the peace which shall follow this war . " They responsible statesmen believe that peace should rest upon the rights of peoples , not the rights of governments  --  the rights of peoples great or small , weak or powerful  --  their equal right to freedom and security and self-government and to a participation upon fair terms in the economic opportunities of the world  --  the German peo  --  ple , of course , included , if they will accept equality and not seek domination . " Mr. Roosevelt with considerable violence repudiates a peace of equality . At New York on October 5 he seemed to place the President among the " enemies of mankind , " for he declared : " We should make it clearly un  --  derstood that the conduct of Germany has been such that we regard as the enemies of mankind all people who would strive to bring about peace based upon treating Germany , Austria , and Turkey on the one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footing of equality . " The Presi  --  dent has plainly declared the dismemberment of empires " no proper basis for a peace of any kind , least of all for an enduring peace . " In Mr. Roosevelt 's October 5 speech we find the specific declaration that " the only peace that will make the world safe for democracy is a peace based uponthe complete overthrow of Germany and the dissolution of Austria and Turkey , " followed by a detailed exposition of the manner in which that dissolution should be worked out . The President at the very beginning stated : " We have no quarrel with the German people . We have no feeling toward them but one of sympathy and friendship . " But Mr. Roosevelt has put himself in the very forefront of that nu  --  merous body who stimulate the war spirit by exacerbating American feeling towards Germans . This is enough to show hew complete is the antithesis ; how opposed to the President 's attitude towards the war is Mr. Roosevelt 's . The central point of the President 's policy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ity of nations and buttressed by the organization of some sort of international democratic society of nations . He is indifferent to that punishing of Germany which Mr. Roose  --  velt , trusting to the deterrent power of punishment , would make the primary goal of national endeavor . The " peace of overwhelming victory , " which Mr. Roosevelt proclaims es  --  sential , the President does not regard as one likely to en  --  dure . Mr. Roosevelt will be satisfied if together with the overthrow of Germany the United States gains some sort of acknowledgment by European nations of its hegemony in the Caribbean . Mr. Roosevelt looks forward with satisfac  --  tion to a " peace " in which the United States shall remain armed to the teeth . The President will accept such a peace only as the price of failure . " Mr. Roosevelt 's recent tour has served to bring his posi  --  tion before the country . His leadership is affording a rally  --  ing place to those who are out of sympathy with Wilson 's policy . His speeches are furnishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal dislike of the Presi  --  dent is strong . And while so much has been said of the evil effect in Russia of Mr. La Follette 's speeches it may not be out of order to suggest that the effect upon German pub  --  lic opinion of the statement of American aims by Mr. Roose  --  velt ( a far more important personage than Mr. La Follette ) is almost certain to be to narrow the breach between the German people and the German autocracy , an effect rather more disastrous to American success in the war than any  --  thing it is possible to imagine Mr. La Follette accomplish  --  ing . Woodrow Wilson 's conception of American purpose in the war is one requiring the exercise of some degree of imagina  --  tion on the part of the people before it can obtain acceptance . It involves very radical departures from American practice . It necessitates the surrender of certain attributes of Ameri  --  can national independence . It could never win support at all if it were not for the magnitude of the disaster which nationalism has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filment constitutes high adventure . With Mr. Roosevelt in the field against it , the friends of an " enduring " peace , a liberal peace , a peace of equality , a peace of a world made safe for democracy through democratic world organization ? the friends of such a peace had better bestir themselves . The time which is now being wasted in pillorying the inef  --  fective pacifists should be devoted to popularizing an idea which must win its way to acceptance against prejudice and conservatism and the inertia of long habit . Those who rail against the opponents of the war may indeed be playing the game of the opposition to making the war an instrument of liberal progress . For much of the opposition to the war comes from those doubting Thomases who can not conceive of war as such an instrument but whose support of a liberal peace may yet prove valuable , provided they are not destroy  --  ed by prejudice and intolerance in the meantime . Mr. Roose  --  velt 's , not Mr. La Follette 's , is the opposition which liberals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hum , Pittsfield , Mass. , October 18 WAR AND DEMOCRACY ? A FRENCH VIEW To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : In dealing with such a subject my intention is , not to introduce any new solution of my own , but to try to sum up the essential elements in the outlook of the ordinary Frenchman of our times . I shall try to give the view of the young man who has been in the war , for he will be the most active and influential factor in the future . He went to war , it is clear , because France was invaded . But what does " defending France " mean ? It is not only fighting for a country , a flag , a surface of land , a tradition , although these things seem to many worth fighting for . Will the reader agree if I say that it means perhaps , too , defending the land of free invention , discussion , and experi  --  ment for social progress ; a living laboratory where new principles were tried ( at our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps we did not go to war because of that . But still we fought because we loved France , and we loved France because she meant that . In my country , before this crisis , everything was far from being perfect . As a nation we had no aggressive plan at all . There had been a bitter injustice committed upon us , in 1871 , when Germany deprived us of Alsace-Lorraine , and we kept the hope that this would be read  --  justed some time . But few expected that readjustment from a war , since war had proved to mean injustice . And we believed that other peoples had the same attitude to  --  wards war . We came to lose the belief in the possibility of war itself . The generation which followed ' 71 , and which preceded mine , proved to be comparatively indif  --  ferent to the various foreign problems which did not con  --  cern France immediately , because they believed that France could not be involved against her will in an armed con  --  flict . Then came the experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awakening to danger , and to the great modern fact that now everybody is concerned with every  --  thing that happens in the world . In 1904-5 came the Russo-Japanese war . Most of us did not feel that we were strongly affected by it . Still we were . The following year , our Russian ally being weaker , Germany began her aggressive policy in the Moroc  --  can question ; then she provoked brutal incidents in Alsace . In 1908 came the annexation of Bosnia by Austria , against the will of the Servian population . And this was the direct source of the Balkan troubles and of the European war . I was serving as a soldier at that time , and I remember my comrades asking me to explain what was the connection be  --  tween that remote province and their possible going to bat  --  tle against the Prussians ! Many of them did not believe that such a connection existed . Even during the Balkan war of 1912 , many people said in France : " Let those peo  --  ple fight if they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Still , Servian national aspirations meant the end of German ambitions in " Mitteleuropa " ; and in 1914 , in order to crush Servian aspirations , Austria and Germany went to war . . . against us . So there was a connec  --  tion . . . . My deep conviction is that the peril could have been checked in 1913 in the Balkans , if we all had had sufficient information . That is why I believe that the ignorance and indifference of the world is the greatest , worst enemy of mankind and of peace . And , above all , this war has to wipe out international ignorance . Now , what is the present feeling of the Frenchman who has " seen it through " ? I dare say that there is one idea that dominates all others . And it dominates them from such a height that one could say it is not the princi  --  pal idea of our men , but the only one : This war has to be the last one . Everybody is awake to that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but any of our " bonhommes " in any trench of the front , he will tell you sternly , simply : " We do this , and we remain here , and we shall remain to the end , so that our children wo n't have to do it agaiim . " How is that to happen ? We can not yet outline the exact details , but we believe it will happen through a certain common interpretation of democracy ; and that is why we believe in democracy , not as a dream , but as a mighty reality , whose first effect will be to preveint the return of world calamities like this . I say a common interpretation of democracy . And , in  --  deed , if something like a league of nations , a common work for common purpose , is to be brought about , it can be only through a common interpretation of the term which we are now using as a watchword . That term , and all the various notions that it involves , have to be carefully defined , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The more we can express in common now , the easier the task will be at the end of the war , the further we shall be able to carry our first common results . Now let me tell , on my own responsibility , what I mean by democracy , I being independent of political parties , and having observed a little , in various countries of our Western World and of the Near East , during this crisis : Democracy is a name for a common basis ; it is the ground on which every personal , independent , original life can be erected . It is not an end in itself , as the German con  --  ception of the State or the Roman conception of the Empire was . It is a beginning . It is not a ceiling . It is a floor ; the main floor , for all human undertakings to be built upon . It is not a limitation to individuality , it is a pro  --  tection for it . And if I may express my full thought : As a French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for democracy it is be  --  cause it offers the safest and most acceptable and loyal basis for individualism . By individualism I do n't mean egoism and selfish aims : the highest aim for individual life is probably self-sacrifice . But it has to be voluntary sacrifice . Sacrifice to what you choose , and love , and want to serve . It is not a mechanical , artificial state which has been imposed upon you , and in which everything is pro  --  vided , except the possibility of your own choice , or right to a choice . It has been objected that in order to fight we had to Prussianize ourselves . But our hearts have not lost so quickly their love of liberty . We had rather get appar  --  ently Prussianized for a time than to get Prussianized for ever , and the world with us , by permitting the Prussian victory . I hope that I am as far as possible from being paradoxi  --  cal . Democracy is a matter of common-sense , as much as art and private life are matters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I suppose they are , in the mind of a great number , and of most of the fighting men , and only need to be formulated , as they scarcely begin to be . I read in the papers that when General Pershing landed at Boulogne , General Dumas , who is not a diplomat nor a theorist , but the commander of our Northern region , said to him : " Your coming opens a new era in the history of the world . The United States of America is now tak  --  ing its part with the United States of Europe . Together they are about to found the United States of the World , which will definitely and finally end the war and give a peace which will be enduring and fruitful for humanity . " This expresses , I think , the belief of our ordinary French  --  man . And why should that hope prove to be vain ? It is reasonable , on the contrary , since it expresses the will of the overwhelming majority in a matter where the majority will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun as an isolated attempt for conquest , will end in a general cooperation for the main tenance of order . PIERRE DE LANUX New York , October 15 BOOKS Washington 's Aide IN the preface to this memorial work Mr. Humphreys complains of those authors who , for lack of original re  --  search , have not known and spoken of the proper merit of the man whom John Trumbull called " belov 'd of Wash  --  ington . " The new biography is indeed content to rely somewhat largely upon Marshall 's and Irving 's lives of Washington and Lossing 's " Field Book of the American Revolution " for the main outlines of the earlier chapters , but by its considerable use of local histories and its repro  --  duction of many letters from Humphreys which had re  --  mained untouched in the Archives of the State Depart  --  ment and elsewhere it succeeds in casting not a little light upon a figure that was growing very dim . There is par  --  tiality in the picture : Mr. Humphreys appears to be still a Federalist ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Madrid ; he scolds Yale for neglecting certain Humphreys relics ; he does not qualify his assertions that Humphreys was " the most finished scholar among Washington 's aides " and " the best diplomatist which sic the first President of the United States had in his service . " There are , too , frequent inaccuracies of detail . Cotton Mather is credited with a " Magnolia " and Joel Barlow with a " Columbia " ( doubtless only by mis  --  prints ) ; Post est opportunitas calva is rendered " The fu  --  ture is a bare chance . " Can it be in malice that Jefferson is made in one of his letters , herein quoted , to ask for " La historic del arimante D. Christoval Colomb " ? The book contains such sentences as : " The crushing defeat of Gen. Gates , a congressional appointment without con  --  sultation with Washington , at Camden , South Carolina , on August 16 , 1780 , by Lord Cornwallis showed that body its error . " Humphreys 's play " The Yankey in England " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave the worldthe stage Yankee , that homely personage who had appeared as early as 1787 in Royall Tyler 's " Contrast . " It is to be regretted that the life of Humphreys could not have been told more crisply and compactly  --  to be re  --  gretted because he was a man worth a small , sure place in the national memory . A poet called to battle , like John Hay nearly a century later , Humphreys , who became Wash  --  ington 's aide , was stirred , as was Hay , to a noble venera  --  tion for his great master which moulded his character and shaped all his later life . Like Hay also , Humphreys wanted to write a fit biography of his chief , and got permission from Washington himself , who offered to open his records to him . This plan came to nothing , however , and Hum  --  phreys sang Washington 's praises only in verse now for  --  gotten . Of the verse there is little to say except that it utters , in language which is immensely rhetorical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immensely sincere , the ardent expectations of the Revolutionary generation . Historically it is interesting that Humphreys seems to have been the earliest American writer of sonnets . He believed , like  --  wise , that in his life of Israel Putnam ( 1788 ) he was producing " the first effort in Biography that has been made on this continent . " Though he was as wrong in his be  --  lief as he was highfalutin in his book , he founded an heroic legend which still refuses to die . This literary initiative is but symptomatic of the whole man , who was born for action . His biographer perhaps tends to claim for Humphreys the authorship of various plans and documents not always certainly his , but there can be no doubt that he was a good military secretary . Washington dispatched him to Congress with the captured standards of Cornwallis , a most honorable errand ; after the close of the War the General warmly recommended his former aide to the attention of Congress , which sent him to Europe as Secretary to the Commission for negoti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  lar abroad , he came back to the higher honor of being made an inmate of Washington 's household at Mount Ver  --  non and of attending the new President through the per  --  plexities of his inauguration . Washington first appointed Humphreys one of the Commissioners to the Creek Indians and then used him as special secret agent in Europe , whence he wrote back reports full of shrewd observation and notably free from provincialism . In 1791 he was made Minister Resident at the Court of Portugal , the first for  --  eign Minister , not counting charges , appointed under the Constitution . He spent two successful years at Lisbon . After three more years as Commissioner for Algerine af  --  fairs , which he handled with vigor , he became Minister Plenipotentiary at Madrid . Recalled by Jefferson in 1801 , Humphreys gave up his diplomatic career , which had been eminently tactful and unswervingly republican , and turned to " Industry , " the importance of which he had elaborately expounded in verse while at Lisbon . He imported the first flock of merino sheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trumbull put it , Ere age advanc 'd , back to that land he bore The fleecy treasures of Iberia 's shore a service for which he was awarded a medal by the Massachusetts Society for Promoting Agriculture . He built the first important woollen mill in the country at what came to be called Humphreysville ( now Seymour ) , Connecticut , and there founded an industrial village which by its care for the well-being of its employees helped teach
