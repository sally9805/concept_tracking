Time : The present . Nine o'clock , a night in January . Place : A disorderly , ugly room in a miserable little house in a small town in the far West  --  filled with a strange conglomeration of shabby pieces of old furniture ranging in variety from a broken kitchen chair to the remains of a graceful old English desk . The walls , discolored and broken , are decorated with guns , fishing tackle , a skin or two , several good old prints and sketches , and strangest of all , book shelves filled with good literature in well-worn volumes . A high , hideous stove , with a tin tea kettle on top and a soap box filled with coal and a broken shovel beside it , stands between the windows . A small , well-battered trunk , open and half-packed , is near the center of the room , and the chairs about are filled with boots , coats , hats , shirts , and a general mixture of a man 's belongings , shabby and long out of date . Across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of small machinery  --  the tables and a shelf are also filled with them , and on a chair near the trunk is a small model of a certain machine . The room is lighted by two lamps  --  one tin of the commonest variety , and one tall and ornate , a remnant of elegance . The door at R. back is open , showing something of a bare sleeping-room . At Curtain : John Megaw is standing staring at the model of the machine on the chair . He is a very tall , raw-boned Irishman  --  middle-aged  --  with a general air of cleanliness and businesslike energy . He is smoking a pipe , which he takes out of his mouth to call into the inner room in a strong , rich Irish brogue . MEGAW Since you 're goin ' on your wild goose chase , for the love of Heaven , move ! There 's wan thing that wo n't wait fer ye , Terrance O'Shaunnesey , and that 's the train . p. 3 TERRY ( From within ) It might . MEGAW It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they leave you on it a'tall wid the junk you 're after bringin ' wid ye . TERRY Faith , if they knew what they 're carryin ' , they 'd be givin ' me a coach to meself . MEGAW ( Cautiously touching the machine ) Sure , ' t is a damned queer thing you 're startin ' out to make your fortune wid . Me heart goes like lead in me boots when I look at it . TERRY ( Shouting ) Keep your hands off it , John Megaw . MEGAW ( Jumping ) Stop yellin ' , and come out and git on . There ai n't a minute to lose . TERRY ( Coming into the doorway in his shirt sleeves , trying to button a buttonless waistcoat ) If you see a vest with a button on it , let me have it . MEGAW There must be a button or two in the pile . How 's this ? ( Taking a waistcoat from the floor and tossing it to Terrance . ) TERRY ( Catching it and counting the buttons ) Rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's a poor place to stop . ( Terrance O'Shaunnesey is the essence of romantic Ireland  --  careless , improvident , ready to give away his last cent , light-hearted , irresponsible , irascible and irresistible , with his charm and careless acceptance of life 's hard luck . He gets a small wooden box from the table , finds a large needle and spool of coarse black thread among the nails , string , hammer , and various other useful articles , and , sitting near the stove , cuts the buttons off the one vest and begins laboriously sewing them on to the other. ) p. 4 MEGAW Will you tell me why you 're after takin ' the clothes fer forty men ? TERRY Who said I was taking them ? MEGAW An ' ai n't you ? TERRY I am not . MEGAW An ' why are they dumped on the floor ? Sure , you look like a dago an ' his fire sale . TERRY I 'm bequeathing ' em to you  --  to give away . ' T is a good time  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't much you 've looked at since I 've knowed ye  --  but them wheels  --  which has gone to yer head . TERRY ( Moving with his foot the chair which holds the model , and standing before it looking at it with a whimsical smile ) Well , we 'll see whether they 'll ever get further than my head now , and how far they 'll go . ' T is a long , long way they could go  --  if ' t was half a chance they got . MEGAW When I 'm wid you I believe it , Terry . When I ai n't , I do n't . You pull the eyes out o ' me head wid your talk when I 'm listenin ' to ye , but when I shake it off I know it 's divil 's witchcraft . No man in his senses could believe there 's the power and the money in that little contraption you say there is . ( Going to stand beside Terrance to look at the model. ) p. 5 TERRY ' T is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me your thousand dollars to try to start them going . MEGAW I ca n't believe it of meself . I do n't see how you got it out o' me . A cold sweat I waked up in last night , swearin' ' I 'd come and take it away from you to-day before you got on that train to-night . But here you are  --  still got it  --  and me not sayin ' a word . TERRY It is n't too late  --  you fool . It 's yours yet , you know . You 're as free to take it back as the wind that  --  MEGAW ( Giving Terrance a push ) I 'll give you wan in the eye if you say it again . If ' t was ten times that , I 'd make you take it . It  --  it 's got-a be so . ( Looking at the model . ) A thing that a man wid your brains has been tinkerin ' wid day an ' night fer ten years  --  deprivin ' himself food fer  --  pourin ' his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it was alive and could talk back at ' im  --  by God , it 's got to be so or you 'll be a ravn ' lunatic an ' I 'm a bigger one fer believin ' ye . Terrance , me boy , you 've got-a make it go . No Irishman kin sit still in America and die a-rotting . You got-a make thim wheels go an ' show the world what they kin do . Lord , Terry , you would a bin Mayor o ' New York by this time if you 'd a-put into it all you 've put into this . p. 6 TERRY ( Putting the waistcoat on ) That 's what you ought to be , John , Mayor of New York . MEGAW That 's what I would be , too  --  only fer bein ' Mayor o ' Twin Forks . If only I 'd stopped there instead o ' migratin ' out here  --  and put me talents in the great city  --  nothing could have stopped me . TERRY Nothing but the law . MEGAW ' St @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Holding up a pair of checked trousers to think ) I was a great swell when I picked those up . MEGAW Do n't come back West . ' T was a great mistake  --  a great loss to the country when a man like you drifted out here . TERRY And the country does n't seem to give a damn . MEGAW You wid your learnin '  --  look at the books you 've read  --  ( Pointing to the shelves )  --  and the grand voice you had to sing with , and the inventin ' you 've done . Sure  --  sure , ' t is a genius you are  --  gone wrong . If I 'd had the managin ' of you , I 'd  --  TERRY No , you would n't . It could n't be done . p. 7 MEGAW I 'd show you . TERRY I always break the string to the kite when it sails the highest . MEGAW Some woman ought to a ' tied you down . I bet ' t was one that drove you to this . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whole world on account of a woman . TERRY Divil a one . MEGAW Sure , Terry , you 've told me many a lie I 've swallowed , but that nivver did go down . The way you 're hatin ' the women now is a sure sign wan of ' em had you by the nose once . TERRY And ' t would be a damned good thing if you could mind your own business , John  --  which you never were known to do . How 's that ? ( Putting on first a hat and then a cap . ) MEGAW ( Putting clothes in the trunk ) For the love o ' Mike , take that off your head and look as much like a man as possible . Not the dreamin ' , whistlin ' , fiddlin ' kind that used to come from Ireland . Use your brains , not your heart . You 've got your chance now . TERRY There wo n't be a man left in New York I do n't tackle . Sure , ' t is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only  --  ( Turning to his model again. ) p. 8 MEGAW I know . I know . You see , but they wo n't . You 'll have to knock it into ' em . Come along now . How you goin ' to carry it ? TERRY With my two hands  --  how else ? MEGAW Ai n't you going to box it up at all ? TERRY I am not . I would n't trust it out of my sight . There 's a fortune in it as true as I 'm standing here before it . Why , do n't you see , John , when this touches that little spring  --  MEGAW I see , I see . Make thim see it . Come on . Come on . Git your coat on . Come downstairs and I 'll have Mrs. Flynn put out the drinks fer good luck . TERRY ( Getting into his coat ) There 's Annie now , coming up to tell me Mrs. Flynn says it 's time for me to go . Come in , Annie . I know your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at John . She is extremely tall , extremely thin , and extremely faded  --  about sixteen  --  in slatternly clothes , with a braid of hair hanging , and an absolutely blank expression on her pale face . ) I know . Give your mother my compliments and tell her to set out  --  MEGAW The liquor 's on me. p. 9 TERRY On me . No , Annie , I 'm sorry to say , there 's nothing here that will answer your purpose nor enhance your charm and beauty in the slightest degree . ( As Annie 's eyes rove curiously about the room . ) Hold  --  what about that ? ( Taking a tie from the back of a chair ) You can wear it in the form of a bow in your hair or a frou-frou at your throat  --  whichever you fancy . MEGAW Shut up , Terry . Get along downstairs , girl . ANNIE Maw said to tell you to be careful  --  the train might be on time to-night . TERRY Yes , I 'd thought of that . ANNIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm runnin ' this . Go on , will you ? ANNIE Oh ! ( Picking up the tie , she turns slowly and goes out . ) MEGAW ( Taking out his watch ) It 's no joke . You 'll monkey ' round here till  --  TERRY No power on earth could make me miss that train . I 'm going to the end of the rainbow , man . ( He sings as he knocks things about , putting shirts and socks in his bag. ) p. 10 MEGAW It 's the up and the down of you that I 'm skeert of , Terry . You 're in the clouds now , but what you 'll do when the friend you 're layin ' such store by throws you down cold  --  that 's what I keep thinkin ' about . TERRY He wo n't turn me down . Jack is a good old pal and as smart a one as ever grew . His business it is  --  promoting . He always told me if I 'd only stick at one thing  --  not a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his letters how open his arms are to me and my invention . Sure , there 's three fortunes in it . One for me and one for him . And there 's one for you besides , John . Do n't forget that . MEGAW Lord , the silly faith of ye . I ought to be goin ' meself instead of you . Mind they do n't steal it from under your nose , man . TERRY It 's appreciating it you are more and more , John , as the time comes to go . We 'll be ridin ' in chaises this time next year with  --  ( Crosses to chair below stove . ) ANNIE ( Opening the door again ) There 's a woman and a child a-comin ' up the stairs . She says she 's got to see you . MEGAW What in blazes !  --  TERRY A what ? p. 11 ANNIE A woman and a child . She 's a-comin ' ! MEGAW ( Laughing ) Caught wid the goods at last . I always wondered when it would come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know any woman . You tell her she ca n't come up . Do you hear ? She ca n't come . ANNIE She 's a-comin ' . TERRY No , she is n't . MEGAW Do n't kick ' er out . Looks bad . TERRY Shut up , John . MEGAW Oh , stidy now , stidy . Do n't let ' er see you 're skeert . TERRY ( Shouting at Annie ) You tell her  --  ( Annie has stepped to one side and a little old Irish-woman , thin and wiry , comes into the doorway , with a little girl clinging to her side . The woman , who is dressed in nondescript , cast-off clothes , has an air of grim respectability . The child is small , slender , and the wistful face is delicately pretty . Her faded little cotton frock is clean but outgrown , and so short that her knees are bare . On a sleeve of her thin , short coat is a broad band of black . Her hands are bare and red . The hat is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the doorway she hides her face against the old woman. ) p. 12 LIZZIE ( In a very broad Irish brogue ) Which of ye is Mr. Terrance O'Shaunnesey ? TERRY ( After a pause ) Who are you ? LIZZIE I 'm after bringin ' your brother 's child to you  --  him dead since she was born and the mother only dead these two days . There , there , darlin ' do n't cry . ' T is your Uncle Terry you 've got to now . TERRY What ? LIZZIE ' T is true it is . TERRY Where did you come from ? LIZZIE ' T is up the road ten miles at Spring Holler these two years she 's been livin ' only fer the purpose o ' bein ' near you , knowin ' she 'd go off suddint and soon . She always said , said she  --  " Lizzie , he ca n't refuse to take his brother 's child once he sees ' er , an ' me gone  --  no matter what bitter , hard feelin ' there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thim was always her words and  --  TERRY How in the name of Heaven did she know where I was ? LIZZIE Sure , that was the one thing she spent her time knowin ' . Her workin ' her pretty fingers off to keep the soul and body together in the two of ' em . " Lizzie , " says she  --  she says  --  " I 'll hant you to your dying day if you do n't git me darlin ' Patsy to ' im . An ' here she is . Do n't cry , dearie , your troubles are over now . Here 's your Uncle Terry . Go and tell him you 've come to live with him . " ( She pushes Patsy forward and the child advances a little towards him timidly , staring at him wistfully. ) p. 13 PATSY Are you my dear Uncle Terry ? TERRY ( Sitting with a thud in the chair just back of him ) You seem to think I am . MEGAW A pretty mess of porridge . Is she tellin ' the truth ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ah sure , I 'm forgettin ' the letter her own hands wrote to ye . ( Reaching into her skirt pocket and bringing out a letter ) Here , give it to him , darlin ' , beggin ' you in the name of mercy to forgive your brother and be good to his little girl . ( Patsy gives the letter to Terrance and stands watching him as he reads it ) Do n't be judgin ' the wife by your own brother . A bad scamp he must ' a ' been  --  but Heaven 's own angel was she . If iver a saint come down to live on earth , ' t was her . The sweet ways of her !  --  ' T would melt a stone . She was  --  MEGAW Leave off  --  leave off  --  will you ? Is it the truth she is speakin ' ? TERRY ( Finishing the letter and looking at Patsy ) It is . MEGAW ( To Lizzie ) And a damned bad time it is you 've come wid your mess o ' talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thirty minutes . p. 14 LIZZIE ( Aghast ) What ? MEGAW Going on the most important thing he iver done in his life . You git yerself out o ' here and go back where you come from . Do n't you know better than to take a man unawares like  --  LIZZIE ( Wailing ) Oh , moi  --  oh , moi  --  fer the love o ' Heaven  --  TERRY Do n't !  --  do n't ! MEGAW Ca n't you see that ye  --  LIZZIE Oh , moi  --  oh , moi  --  TERRY Do n't  --  do n't , I say . MEGAW There 's a train back in  --  TERRY Hold on ! ( To Lizzie ) You 'll stay here  --  the two of you till I get back . LIZZIE What ? TERRY Or till I write you what to do . Mrs. Flynn will take care of you , and you 'll have these rooms . LIZZIE What ? TERRY This will keep you going for a little while  --  ( Taking two bills from his pocket and giving them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself with a family before you know whether you 'll ever make a red cent or not ? TERRY The saddling seems to be already done . LIZZIE ( To John ) Man , man , have you no heart at all ? MEGAW See here now , we 've had enough of  --  TERRY ( To John ) ' St ! ' St ! ( Turning to Lizzie ) Do n't you see it 's going away I am ? The best I can do is to give you my house . Now if you 'll take her downstairs till I get out , you can take possession when I 'm gone . LIZZIE Oh , but your honor you could n't  --  MEGAW Trot along now and do n't be after hinderin ' ' im more . TERRY Tell Mrs. Flynn you 're going to stay and to give you something to eat . LIZZIE ( Taking up the bag to go ) Oh moi , oh moi ! Come , Patsy , darlin ' . ( Patsy does n't move . There is a pause as she stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? p. 16 TERRY ( Hesitating ) Well , begging your ladyship 's pardon , I 'm going away . PATSY Do n't you love me ? TERRY Ah  --  ' t is very sudden it is . PATSY Mother said I must love you and that you would love me and be very good to me . TERRY I  --  you  --  ca n't you see ' t is goin ' away I am ? PATSY ( With a sudden cry and sob ) Mother ! Mother ! He does n't want me . LIZZIE Darlin ' , darlin ' , do n't  --  do n't , dearie . ( Glaring at Terrance ) Have you no heart at all ? PATSY Mother said he would love me if I was a good girl . ( Looking at Terrance through her sobs ) Did you think I was bad ? TERRY ( To John ) Go down with the old woman and send up some food . MEGAW What are you going to do ? TERRY Do as I tell you . ( Nodding to Lizzie ) Go down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( To John ) Go on . I 'm coming . Shake up a little food and send it up here . p. 17 MEGAW Are you out of your wits entirely ? TERRY Maybe I am . Make haste , will you ? Go on  --  go on , will you now . Move . MEGAW ( Driving Lizzie before him ) Go on  --  go on , will you ? The train 's leavin ' an ' you raisin ' the devil like a man had nothin ' to do but  --  ( Lizzie , talking back at him , precedes him out of the room . ) TERRY ( After a pause , looking down at Patsy , who stares solemnly at him ) Since it 's stayin ' you are , will you take off your hat ? ( She shakes her head . ) No ? Are you cold at all ? ( She nods . ) Bless my soul , maybe it 's frozen you are . ( Throwing some coal on the stove , and shaking the shaker , and pushing the chair nearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , thank you . ( She shivers . ) TERRY Sure , it 's shivering you are . Move a little closer to the fire . ( He gives her a push and touches one of her hands . ) Heaven help us  --  ' t is a bit of ice your hand is . Could n't you  --  ( He drops into the chair near her and gives a tug to her short sleeve which refuses to come down , and then to her skirts ) No wonder you 're freezin '  --  with the length of it . You tell your old woman to buy you something warm enough and long enough to-morrow . p. 18 PATSY She is n't an old woman . TERRY What is she , then ? PATSY She 's my Lizzie-Tizzie . TERRY Is she  --  tizzie ? And what 's your name ? PATSY Patsy . TERRY Well , Miss Patsy-Pat , you do n't seem to be getting much warmer . ( Looking about and then going into the bedroom , he comes back with a red blanket . ) Try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her , with only her head left out . ) PATSY Do you love me now ? TERRY That seems to be a terribly important thing in your life . ' T is much more to the point to keep you from freezing and starving to death , eh ? ( Annie comes in with a small , yellow bowl of bread and milk , and a large spoon . ) Ha  --  ha ! Here 's Annie-Tannie with the food . Bread and milk is it ? Will that do ? ( Patsy nods . ) Well , get it inside of you , quick . PATSY You tied up my hands . TERRY I did that . Here , you feed it to her , Annie . p. 19 PATSY Oh , no ! TERRY What ? PATSY You do it  --  please . ( Terrance , about to refuse , hesitates , and , looking helplessly from the bowl to Patsy , lifts her onto his knee , and takes the bowl from Annie . Annie grins . ) TERRY Get out  --  and shut the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her back to Terrance . ) ANNIE Maw says you 're enough of a blathuskite to miss the train , after all . TERRY ( Shouting ) Shut the door ! ( Annie goes , closing the door without turning . ) PATSY Is she a very bad girl ? TERRY She 's a black sinner . Here , lap this up . Lord , ' t is a young spade she 's brought for a spoon . Open your mouth wide . PATSY That is n't nice . TERRY Never mind your table manners , since we have no table  --  but get this inside of you . PATSY Hold it , please . p. 20 TERRY What ? Oh ! ( He holds the bowl so that she can drink the milk . ) PATSY It 's good ! TERRY Is it now ? ( She takes another long drink . ) PATSY Thank you . ( He gives her several spoonfuls  --  she shakes her head and refuses the last  --  he puts the bowl on the floor . ) TERRY Now ! Getting warmer ? PATSY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . How does it come  --  front or back ? PATSY This way . ( Nodding her chin . ) ( He manages to get the hat off , and puts it on the floor . Patsy yawns . ) TERRY And is n't it about time you were going to sleep ? PATSY Will you tell me a story ? TERRY I will not . PATSY Mother said you would . TERRY Oh , she did  --  did she ? PATSY She always did . p. 21 TERRY Oh ! PATSY About when she was a little girl . You tell about when you were a little boy . ( Putting her head on his shoulder ) I 'm not very comfortable . TERRY The devil you ai n't . What do you think I am ? PATSY ( Taking his arm . He gradually holds her closer ) That 's better . TERRY I 'm glad you think so . PATSY Mother said you did n't have any little girl , and you would n't know how to hold me at first , but that you would learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will ? TERRY Sure , I 've got something else to learn besides this . PATSY You are n't going away , are you ? TERRY It does n't look like it . PATSY I want you to stay . Go on  --  once upon a time  --  when you were a little , little boy , you lived in Ireland and then when you grew up , you got in a big , big boat and sailed and sailed way over here , and then you sang be-a-u-ti-ful songs , and the pretty lady broke your heart , and you went a way , way off . And then what did you do ? p. 22 TERRY In the name of Heaven , who told you that ? PATSY Mother . Go on . What did the pretty lady do ? TERRY Ah , she could n't wait for the songs . They poured their heart out for her and knocked at every door , but the golden door never opened , and she would n't wait . She  --  PATSY What ? TERRY She married the other man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did . PATSY She was a naughty lady . TERRY Do you think so ? Sometimes I think she was and sometimes I think she was n't . Being a woman , she wanted a house to live in and clothes to put on her back  --  songs and dreams and hope and love  --  would n't do . She was wise and I was the fool . They 're like that  --  women  --  tying you down to this and that  --  and when you want to fly a bit , they tell you what a will-o ' - the- wisp you are to believe in , and how money must come in or love will fly out . PATSY ( After waiting ) And then ? TERRY There was n't any " and then "  --  only this  --  ( Looking at the room )  --  and shadows and ghosts in the corners , till the cobwebs began to come and almost shut out the light  --  till one day  --  p. 23 PATSY What ?

PATSY Oh , my  --  TERRY And the threads kept going ' round and ' round till we spun something out of our dream  --  she and I  --  that some day we 're going to turn into gold . PATSY Oh  --  oh ! TERRY But it 's too late to buy the love now , is n't it ? PATSY I love you . TERRY Faith , it 's easy fer a woman to say at any age . PATSY Do you love me ? TERRY And what if I did ? What then ? PATSY Then mother would be happy . ( She grows more and more sleepy . ) She always sings after the story and she said you would . ( A pause , as she closes her eyes and puts her head against his cheek . ) Go on  --  I ca n't go to sleep if you do n't . ( Very softly he sings broken snatches of an Irish song . Her head sinks lower and she sleeps . John opens the door . Terrance shakes his head at him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John takes off coats and hats . Terrance , holding Patsy very carefully , puts her on the sofa as Lizzie and Annie come back . John shows Terrance his open watch . Terrance puts on his hat  --  both men their overcoats . John takes the bag and Terrance the model , putting it in a cover with a strap . They start to the door. ) p. 24 PATSY ( Waking ) Where are you going ? LIZZIE Oh , darlin '  --  MEGAW Now , no nonsense . PATSY ( Getting quickly off the couch and going to Terrance , trailing the blanket after her ) Where are you going ? TERRY I  --  the  --  I 'm going to the train . PATSY Do n't leave me . MEGAW Go on , Terry . Ten minutes you have . PATSY Do n't leave me . LIZZIE Patsy , darlin '  --  PATSY Mother ! Mother !

PATSY ( Throwing the money away ) Take me ! TERRY I ca n't , child . Listen ! ( She throws herself full length on the floor at his feet with a heartbroken scream ) p. 25 PATSY Mother ! Mother ! He does n't love me . ( She sobs convulsively . ) MEGAW ( To Lizzie ) Take her up . Go on . Go on , Terry . LIZZIE Holy mother ! What will become of her ? PATSY ( With a still louder cry ) Mother ! Mother ! TERRY ( Lifting her in his arms , and wrapping her blanket about her ) Lizzie , get your bag and come on . New York 's big enough for all of us . MEGAW What do you mean ? TERRY I 'm going to take her with me . Why not ? It 's all in a life time . MEGAW You 're fool enough to do it , too . Put her down . ( Patsy hugs him tighter . ) Put her down , I say . I 've got you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's right . Push us all . Do n't let me stop . I always fall down at the top . Give me a boost . MEGAW You 'll have to walk over my dead body to get on the train with that child . Put her down , I say . p. 26 TERRY ( To John ) She 's mine , you know . I ca n't step on a child to get there . If the wheels go , they 'll take care of us all . If they do n't  --  they wo n't . Give me that , Lizzie . ( Lizzie gives him the model . ) Careful  --  careful of that . Are you game , Lizzie ? Will you come to the moon with us ? LIZZIE You ca n't shake me off if you take that child . TERRY Good-bye , Annie , and good luck . Keep the fire burning till we 're back .

Lizzie is sitting rigidly on the sofa , mechanically turning the pages of a magazine . Patsy is at the window , looking out .

You 'll have me crazy . I ca n't bring ' im . If I could , I  --  ( There is a loud knock at the hall door . ) PATSY ( Running to it ) Uncle Terry ! ( A Bell Boy comes into the room , holding the door wide open , and Mary Harrington , a tall , slender woman about thirty-five , comes into the doorway . She is very modestly and plainly dressed , but with the unmistakable air of a lady , and has in her personality a certain imperious charm , subdued by her present timidity and the sadness which is in her very lovely face. ) p. 29 BOY A lady to see Mr. O'Shaunnesey ! PATSY Oh ! LIZZIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will you walk in , ma 'm ? Walk in . HARRINGTON ( Coming timidly a step or two into the room ) Is Mr. O'Shaunnesey here ? LIZZIE ' T is a pity now he ai n't .

Go ' long wid you ! ( Brushing him out  --  and closing the door . ) Beggin ' your pardon , ma'am . HARRINGTON ( Looking at Patsy ) Is this  --  Who is this ? PATSY I 'm Patsy and that 's Lizzie . p. 30 HARRINGTON ( Still standing ) Are you Mr. O'Shaunnesey 's little girl ? PATSY No  --  yes . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to heaven and I 've come to live with my Uncle Terry . He 's a very , very , very nice man and he loves me very much . HARRINGTON I 'm sure he does . ( Slowly putting her hand on Patsy 's head ) And do you love him ? PATSY Of course . You would , too  --  if you knew him . HARRINGTON Do you think I would ? LIZZIE Sure , it is the grand man he is  --  but between you and me , a little peculiar . But you 're after knowin ' him yourself , of course . I need n't be tellin ' you . ( A slight pause . ) Ai n't you ? HARRINGTON I  --  I  --  came to see him on business . LIZZIE Did you , now ? Sure , ' t is full of business he is . Set down , ma 'm . Set down . HARRINGTON I do n't think I will  --  thank you . You say you expect him soon ? LIZZIE Always about this time he turns up . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he has n't been here very long , has he ? LIZZIE Three days , it is . HARRINGTON And has he  --  ? You see , I came because he  --  Well , you see , I came about the position of governess . I understand he wants a governess in a great hurry  --  for his little girl . LIZZIE ( Suddenly changing from her affableness to suspicion and fear ) A what is it ? HARRINGTON A governess . LIZZIE An ' what do you mean by that ? HARRINGTON Someone to look after her , of course . To teach her and  --  and help her to be all that her mother wanted her to be  --  I 'm sure . LIZZIE Sure , ' t is misinformed you are entirely . Somebody 's been lyin ' to you , hard . HARRINGTON Oh . . .

I 'd like to see  --  Who 's been tellin ' you this at all ? p. 32 HARRINGTON There evidently is some mistake . You 're her nurse , of course , but she  --  Perhaps Mr. O'Shaunnesey thinks she needs someone else too , now that she 's come to live in New York . LIZZIE Someone else , is it ? Sure , I 'm as good in New York as I was in Five Forks . I 'll show ' im ' t is back I 'll take her quick if he tries any tricks like that on me . Do you want anybody else but Lizzie takin ' care of you , child ? PATSY ( Going to slip her hand in Mary 's ) My Lizzie-Tizzie takes care of me , but I  --  I 'd like you to come to see me . LIZZIE Come here . Come here to me , child . What do you mean makin ' up to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) She loves you better than anyone in the world , of course . There evidently is a mistake .

( Putting out her hand to Patsy . ) I think it would be nice to play with you . Maybe I 'll see you  --  some time  --  some place  --  someway . We never know  --  quite how things will turn out , do we ? p. 33 PATSY Do you know stories ? HARRINGTON Lots of them . PATSY Oh , dear ! I wish you would n't go away . HARRINGTON Thank you .

You 'll forgive me for coming , wo n't you ? You see , I did n't  --  ( There is another loud knock at the door . ) PATSY There he is ! There he is ! ( Running to open it . ) Oh  --  Uncle Terry  --  come in ! Come in ! ( She opens the door and the Bell Boy comes in , almost hidden by the armful of boxes and packages of all sorts and sizes he is carrying . Boxes for dresses , hats , shoes , etc. ) p. 34 BOY For Miss Patsy O'Shaunnesey . PATSY Oh ! LIZZIE What is it at all ? BOY These are for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boxes ) What 's that ? PATSY Oh !

HARRINGTON Some one is getting some presents . How nice ! PATSY From Terry Lerry . He said he 'd send some . LIZZIE He did n't say he 'd send the town .

PATSY You 're a lovely lady . p. 35 HARRINGTON Tell him you 'd like the lovely lady to come to see you , will you ? And give him this for me ?

PATSY ( Dancing about the boxes ) Hurry  --  hurry ! LIZZIE Hold your horses , darlin ' . ( Patsy sits on the floor , opening a hat box . Lizzie begins opening the others , spilling out a bewildering array of gay and elaborate clothes for a little girl . ) PATSY Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Lizzie-Tizzie ! Look  --  look  --  look ! ( Getting the hat box open and taking out a pink tulle hat with roses and streamers . She gets to her feet and puts it on her head , almost disappearing from view as the large hat settles down on her ears . ) Is n't it beau-tiful ? LIZZIE Sure , you 're a lady at last .

LIZZIE ( Opening a shoe box ) To be sure there is . He would n't fergit the shoes an ' him doin ' it handsome . Look at that now . Ai n't thim lovely ? PATSY ( Snatching the white pumps and sitting on the floor to pull off her old ones and put on the new ) This is the kind the princess wears . Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Look  --  look  --  look  --  ( She walks about in the pumps which are much too long for her , holding up the dress , which comes almost to her ankles . ) LIZZIE If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grand man !

PATSY ( Darting after the pink sash of wide beautiful ribbon ) Put it on  --  put it on , please , Lizzie . Quick . Make a big , big bow , Lizzie . LIZZIE If you 'll stand still long enough , I will . Lord , Lord , ai n't it grand ! ' T is so t'ick it wo n't bend . PATSY I wish I could see it . ( Walking out and trying to see the bow in the back. ) p. 38 LIZZIE There 's nivir a child in all the great city dresses finer than that .

PATSY ( Facing the hall door as she stops ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opening the hall door and stopping in amazement . He wears the clothes of Act I and carefully carries his model ) Bless my Irish soul ! Is it the Queen of Hearts has come to see me ? PATSY No  --  no  --  the princess . TERRY Excuse my blunder . Your Highness . ( He is excited and elated . Putting the model on the chair , he uncovers it , and taking letters and drawings from his pockets , puts them on the table  --  going back and forth , examining and comparing the sketches with the model . ) Has Jack been here yet ? LIZZIE He has not . TERRY No message from him at all ? LIZZIE Nothing at all , your honor . A pretty pile o ' money you 've spent this day on that bit o ' flesh . p. 39 TERRY Why not , when ' t is falling into my hands out of the skies ? LIZZIE Is fortune goin ' well fer you , your honor , if I might be so bold as to ask ? PATSY You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his papers at the table ) Sure , ' t is nothing else I can look at with the beauty of it . PATSY And you must be the prince and kneel . TERRY Sure , my keeling days are over long ago . ( Spreading some sketches of his machine on the table . ) PATSY Please , please , Uncle Terry , I want you to  --  so much . TERRY You do ? ( Looking at her and going to her slowly . ) Is it one or both I kneel on ? PATSY Only one . TERRY ( Going down on one knee ) Thank God for that ! PATSY And then he always takes off his hat this way . . . ( Showing him how . ) TERRY ( Taking his off with a wide flourish ) Does he , indeed ? p. 40 PATSY And kisses her hand . TERRY The devil he does ! The gay dog ! PATSY And then they both sit down and she shows him all the beautiful things he has sent her .

' T is the sure way to a woman 's heart . I 'm finding it out a little late . LIZZIE It 's the handsome thing you done by her , your honor . And right you are to want your niece to do you credit in the great city . TERRY Sure , the whole town will be agog with the wonder of it . They 'll never be able to go about their own business when they know about us . PATSY ( Who has been opening small packages ) I 'll put on every single thing , Uncle Terry , and you can see what you like best . p. 41 TERRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do at all . Have there been any ladies calling today ? LIZZIE How could there be ladies callin ' ? TERRY And why not ? Mr. Manning sent to a place where they keep ' em  --  nurses and such . The princess has to have one . LIZZIE Niver ! Niver ! You 'll walk over me dead body first . I promised  --  TERRY Whist ! Whist ! She needs the two of you . LIZZIE Oh , moi ! Oh , moi ! TERRY Not one to take your place , but for a different thing entirely . To teach her manners and reading and writing and all the things a princess knows . LIZZIE And rui n't she 'll be entirely . I know ' em . The good-for-nothin ' , lyin ' , thievin ' lot they are ! TERRY I 'm glad you 're so pleased with the idea , Lizzie . You 'll make it pleasant for the lady . LIZZIE Sure , who is it at all ? Have you got one a-ready ? TERRY Not yet . LIZZIE It 's made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one o ' thim things . p. 42 TERRY It 's shining so bright it 's got into my eyes and gone to my head . LIZZIE Get the woman out o ' your head , your honor . Darlin '  --  he 's goin ' to turn your Lizzie off . What 'll I do ? What 'll become of you ? PATSY A lovely lady came . LIZZIE Oh , moi ! Oh , moi ! TERRY Be quiet , will you ? Did one come at all ? LIZZIE ( Hesitating ) But the one . TERRY What did she look like ? LIZZIE Like she 's seen better days . TERRY We 've all seen those . Well ? LIZZIE ' T is hard up she must be , a lady  --  any wan kin see that wid half an ' eye  --  comin ' here to you fer work . TERRY ' T is sad , it is . An ' when is she goin ' to begin ? LIZZIE ( Rising ) Begin , is it ? Sure , I sent her packin ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Out of the door I sent her . TERRY What ? LIZZIE I did that . p. 43 PATSY She was a sweet lady . She gave me this flower . ( Putting the flower in Terry 's coat . ) TERRY Did she now ? PATSY What 's the matter ? TERRY Um ! Sure , ' t is a flower I have n't seen fer ten years . I used to know a lovely lady loved that kind of a flower . And this one went away , did she ? Why did n't you hold on to her , Patsy ? The next one that comes  --  no matter what she 's like  --  you take her . Do you understand that , Lizzie  --  take her . LIZZIE Oh , moi ! Oh , moi ! Me heart 's broke entirely . ( She wails loudly . There is a knock at the hall door . ) There 's wan of ' em now . Will I leave ' er in at all wid you sittin ' on the floor , looking like a  --  TERRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't look a bigger fool than I am ! ( Lizzie opens the door and Jack McManners enters . He is a very shrewd , good-looking man about forty , extremely well dressed , with a cheerful and agreeable manner , but a certain alert slyness . He carries the model in the cover of Act I. ) TERRY Come in , Jack  --  come in and sit on your thumb . p. 44 MCMANNERS ( Putting the model on the chair ) Well  --  you look as if you were waiting for important news , I must say . TERRY Well , well , well ? Do n't keep me waiting ! How 's it ? What happened ? MCMANNERS I 've seen the great man and he 'll see you tonight . It looks  --  it looks too good to be true . TERRY My God !  --  you 're not jokin ' , boy ? You  --  What did you say ? MCMANNERS It looks like you 've got something there . TERRY God love you ! How could it be ? Do you know what you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MCMANNERS Do n't go to pieces  --  it 's only hope , you know . It 's not the real thing yet , but it looks pretty good , pretty good . TERRY How can it be true , man ? How can it ? What did he say ? What did he  --  here  --  ( Remembering Patsy and Lizzie . ) Get out of this ! Clear all this stuff out . It 's very busy I am . ( Getting on to his feet . ) MCMANNERS Is this your family ? p. 45 TERRY It is that  --  Miss Patsy O'Shaunnesey and Lizzie-Tizzie of Twin Forks . MCMANNERS ( Laughing ) How do you do ? PATSY ( Going to shake hands with him ) How do you do ? TERRY ( Kicking away some of the boxes ) A few necessities we 've been laying in  --  MCMANNERS ( Laughing as Patsy walks away , holding up her dress ) I see . Great style you 're going in for . TERRY What 's the matter with it ? MCMANNERS Nothing at all . Truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it truly amusing , too . What 's the joke ? It 's the best I could buy in your town . MCMANNERS I can see that . LIZZIE Turn ' round and ' round , darlin ' ! ( Patsy turns  --  Jack suppresses a laugh . ) TERRY Well , what do you think ? MCMANNERS It 's very stylish , I should say  --  but perhaps a bit large in effect . p. 46 TERRY Large , is it ? If you could see the size of what she took off , you would n't wonder I got ' em large . Clear out , now , Lizzie , in a hurry . It 's business we 're after . In there , anywhere  --  get ' em out . LIZZIE ( Much injured , beginning to take the things ) Will you give me time ? PATSY Do you want me to go away ? TERRY If it would n't inconvenience you too much . PATSY ( To Jack ) Are you going to stay long ? MCMANNERS It 'll probably seem a long while to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here , Terry-Lerry . You call me when you want me . ( She follows Lizzie through door down left , with her arms full of things . ) TERRY And you say there 's hope ? MCMANNERS Very solid hope . I 've got at the best man in the country for you to convince and get next to . Maybe you think it did n't take wire-pulling to do it . TERRY I bet it did . MCMANNERS He 's the hardest proposition to get at I ever tackled . And harder still when you do get him . You have to shoot quick and hit the first time , or it 's all up . p. 47 TERRY ' T is a wonderful thing you 've done , boy . I ca n't believe my ears . MCMANNERS Well , I do n't mind saying myself it was a pretty good job and a darned quick one . TERRY Quick , was it ? It 's taken my wind entirely . MCMANNERS You see  --  it got him because he thinks it 's come at the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head in his hands . ) What 's the matter ? TERRY The right time ! I 'm thinking the years I sat there with it  --  the days and nights I had no faith and then went at it again , creeping , crawling along . Sure , ' t is the maddest , strangest thing ever happened any man . I 'm going to wake up and find it is n't true . MCMANNERS Do n't begin romancing yet . It is n't clinched , but the first big wedge is driven in  --  and if  --  if I do say it myself  --  it  --  it took a  --  well , you know  --  if I had n't  --  that is  --  I risked an awful lot going to this man . He might have turned me down cold for a fool . I risked an awful lot  --  for you  --  old man . TERRY ( Rising quickly ) Sure you did . Do n't think ' t is not appreciating it from the bottom of my heart I am . You can name your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's very nice  --  awfully nice  --  sounds well . TERRY Eh ? MCMANNERS Sounds well , I say . TERRY Is it only talking you think I am , then ? Here 's my hand on it . MCMANNERS ( Taking the hand Terry thrusts out to him ) Yes , that 's nice , too  --  but , after all , this is business . TERRY Of course it is . The first I 've ever done in my life . MCMANNERS That 's plain enough . Of course , I know you mean what you say . TERRY And the word of a friend is worth more than the bond of a villain . MCMANNERS Well  --  I 'm not so sure about that . TERRY What ? Is it doubting my word you are at all ? MCMANNERS No  --  no  --  no  --  no ! But see here  --  now reduce it to facts  --  after all , we had n't seen each other for a good many years . A few letters have kept us sort of going  --  but now you come out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a ten-foot pole . " Tell it to the marines ! " most people would say , and I take it up and land the biggest man who could handle it  --  and  --  it 's a bit of a leg up to you  --  is n't it ? p. 49 TERRY Leg up , is it ? ' T is my heart and soul you 're after pulling up . As fine a thing as one friend could do for another . MCMANNERS But it is business , you know , and I think we 'd better put a little something down on paper . TERRY Certainly , certainly  --  whatever you say . After all , you do n't know me this long time . MCMANNERS And you do n't really know me . TERRY Oh , yes , I do . That 's different . When it comes to taking your word  --  that 's all right  --  but a bit of paper for you  --  certainly  --  with pleasure . What will you have ? MCMANNERS Well , now , for instance  --  you said something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we say , then  --  if it goes through  --  suppose my share is  --  well , half  --  fifty per cent ? TERRY Why not ? Sure , without you I never would have got to this man at all . MCMANNERS That 's the way I look at it  --  and suppose I give you a check for a thousand  --  and call it an option  --  sort of a retainer ? Meaning you 're not to take this thing to anybody else . p. 50 TERRY ( Laughing ) Sure , ' t is very suspicious of me you are . MCMANNERS Oh , if you feel that way about it  --  TERRY Not at all . Not at all . Why would n't you want some guarantee and you doing the handsome thing ? Of course  --  of course . How will you  --  MCMANNERS ( Sitting at the table ) I 'll draw up a simple little agreement  --  and if we put our names to it  --  we know where we 're at . Do n't we ? ( Patsy comes back , goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Examing the model ) You will . MCMANNERS What ? TERRY You need n't expect me to know whether I 'm coming or going for the rest of my life if ever I see these wheels set moving . MCMANNERS You see , you need somebody to take care of you , and that 's what I 'm going to do . TERRY Faith , ' t is your hands full you 'll have . I always fall down when I get to the top . I warn you of that . ( Patsy has come back  --  still wearing the white dress and with the hat hanging over her back . She goes slowly to stand under Terry 's arm with the old doll of Act I. ) p. 51 PATSY ( Quietly  --  leaning against Terrance ) He did stay a long time  --  did n't he ? TERRY Not very  --  when you think how much he 's done . PATSY What did he do ? TERRY He 's opened the door to Fairy Land ! PATSY Where ? TERRY Right in there . ( Pointing into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep . ' T is so tiny you ca n't see it yet  --  but you will some day when you 'll be walking in . PATSY When ? TERRY Soon  --  soon . Eh , Jack ? ( Jack , writing at the table , does n't hear . ) Do you see the tip of that tiny piece of steel ? PATSY Yes . TERRY ' T is the most precious thing in the world . PATSY As much as me ? TERRY Do n't ask me that , child . For I 'm afraid if I had to answer at this minute you 'd be found wanting . p. 52 MCMANNERS There . If you 'll put your name to that , old man . And here 's the check . It may come in handy just now . TERRY ( Going to sign the paper ) It might . MCMANNERS And will you come and have a bite of dinner with me before we see Stevenson ? TERRY I will that  --  or you with me . PATSY Are you going away ? TERRY Lord  --  Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dear ! MCMANNERS ( As they exchange the papers , check , etc . ) A nice chain you 've put around your neck ! TERRY Neck , is it ? ' T is ' round me feet and under me feet  --  and  --  MCMANNERS What in thunder did you do it for ? TERRY Sure , I do n't know  --  now that I think of it . At the time it seemed the only thing in God 's world could be done . ' T is much obliged I am  --  ( Putting the check in his pocket )  --  and may it be the beginning of many more that will pass between us. p. 53 MCMANNERS ( Getting his hat and going to the door ) Meet me at my place at seven-thirty . All right ? TERRY I 'll be there . Jack  --  MCMANNERS Um ? ( Turning at the door as Terrance pauses . ) TERRY There 's something I want to ask you . MCMANNERS Well ? TERRY Do you ever see  --  do you ever see Mary any more ? MCMANNERS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the people we all used to know . I saw her just the other day , in fact . TERRY Did you , now ? Did she  --  is she  --  is she well , and  --  happy ? MCMANNERS Well enough , I s'pose . I could n't say she looked very happy . She got what was coming to her for what she did to you . It was a rotten deal  --  and it 's a funny shuffle of the cards that you should be on the way to big money at last with one of your dreams that she turned you down for . . . ( Pointing to the machine . ) She 's almost on her uppers . TERRY Oh  --  do n't tell me that ! p. 54 MCMANNERS Certainly she is . She married a rotter . His money was hot air . A sweet time she 's had of it with Harrington . TERRY Oh  --  the shame of it ! The pity of it ! MCMANNERS Do n't tell me there 's still a spark of the old  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did she  --  did you tell her I was here , by any chance ? MCMANNERS Yes . Told her you were here and about to land . TERRY And did she  --  did she  --  What did she say ? MCMANNERS She asked me to say nothing about her at all . That 's why I have n't mentioned her . She seemed glad of your good luck  --  I will say that for her , and  --  and when I told her you needed a governess the worst way , she said she 'd try to find one . Have any of them come , by the way ? TERRY ( Suddenly looking at the flower in his coat ) Maybe she  --  sent the one who  --  MCMANNERS What ? TERRY No  --  it could n't be . MCMANNERS Have you got one ? Have none of them turned up we sent for ? p. 55 TERRY Divil a one . MCMANNERS I 'll ring up the office again for you . It 's a damned nuisance . TERRY It is that . The petticoats of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women in any form is the greatest handicap known to man . PATSY Are you talking about me ? TERRY More or less . MCMANNERS Seven-thirty sharp , mind . Oh ,  --  and have those sketches here  --  ( Going back to table ) This one he said was n't quite clear . Sharpen that up a bit , can you ? TERRY Sure I can . MCMANNERS And bring them with you . TERRY I will that . ( Jack goes out and Terrance sits at the table to work on the sketch . ) PATSY ( Sitting solemnly in a large chair at L. ) Are you busy now ? TERRY I am that . ( Patsy sits motionless , never taking her eyes off Terrance . He works and whistles  --  getting more and more absorbed . At last sees Patsy . ) What are you doing , child ? p. 56 PATSY Waiting for you . TERRY Well , here I am . Have you nothing to do at all ? PATSY Not till you get through . ( With a sigh Terrance goes on working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patsy holds up her finger for her to be quiet , and she sits cautiously on the sofa , near the door , rigidly . Both of them are motionless , their eyes on Terrance . ) TERRY ( Looking up again and seeing both of them ) For the love of Heaven , what are you looking at ? PATSY Are you busy now ? TERRY I am that , and will be for the rest of my life . ( To Lizzie ) Sure , ca n't you find something for her to do but to sit there staring at me ? LIZZIE I 'll do anything you say , sir . TERRY What did you do all the day ? PATSY Waited for you . TERRY Have n't you been out of the house at all ? PATSY No . TERRY ( To Lizzie ) Did n't I tell you to take her out for a walk ? p. 57 LIZZIE Sure , she would n't budge fer fear you 'd be coming in while she was out . TERRY ( Throwing down his pencil and pushing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you take the first one that 's here  --  and keep her till I get back . Do you understand that ? LIZZIE I guess I do . ( She begins to cry quietly . ) PATSY ( Going to Terrance ) You made her cry . TERRY I 'll cry me own eyes out in a minute . Stop it ! ( Shouting at Lizzie . ) PATSY ( Leaning against him ) What makes you so cross , Terry-Lerry ? TERRY Would n't a saint from Heaven tear his hair out by the handful ? PATSY Are you going away with that man ? TERRY I am . PATSY I do n't like him . TERRY That 's a pity . PATSY I s'pose you could n't stay at home with me ? p. 58 TERRY You s'pose right . PATSY If you 'll tell me a story I wo n't cry when you go . TERRY Get out with you . Divil a story do I know . PATSY You told me a beautiful one about when you were a little boy . TERRY Will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me own thoughts a bit ? PATSY I will if you 'll tell me one story . Oh , please , Terry-Lerry  --  I waited so long for you all day . TERRY God  --  love it ! ' T is a little bit of a thing it is to be standing alone in the world , waiting fer the likes of me . Child  --  child , what have I done with you  --  and what would have become of you if I had n't done it ? PATSY Go on : " Once upon a time  --  " TERRY Ah , once upon a time never happened . PATSY What ? TERRY It never happened  --  ' t is only the work-a-day world that goes on . The thing you live in your heart dies and turns to ashes in your hand . PATSY Please  --  just a little one , Terry-Lerry ! ( He begins an Irish folk song , half reciting , and gradually sings it . As he finishes ) p. 59 PATSY ( Throwing her arms about Terry 's neck ) I love you ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you now ? LIZZIE Sure , ' t is a grand singer you are , your honor . TERRY And sure , ' t is great fame I 'm coming into all of a sudden . PATSY You have n't kissed me . TERRY ( Kissing her forehead ) There . PATSY Oh , not that kind . The love-kind . Like this . ( Kissing him on the lips and cheeks . ) TERRY Will you stop ? Faith , your Irish heart is as big as the ocean . ' T is throwing it away you 'll be before many years  --  and somebody 'll take it and throw it back at you . Come along now  --  I 've wasted enough time on you . Get along out of here , will you ? Put it where it belongs and go on . ( Trying to put the hat on her head . ) What ails the thing at all ? PATSY It 's beautiful . TERRY Then ' t is drunk it is with its own beauty . They 're damned queer-looking things . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get them off of her , Lizzie , and back in her own togs , again . I prefer them , I do . Go on  --  get out now . p. 60 LIZZIE ( Rising ) Come , darlin ' . ' T is Lizzie is always glad to have you . PATSY ( Going ) I 'll come back and say goodnight before you go . TERRY You need n't mind . PATSY Oh , I 'll have time . ( She goes in , followed by Lizzie . ) ( Terrance thinks for a moment  --  looks at the flower and goes back to his drawing . There is a soft knock at the door . ) TERRY ( At the table with his back to the door ) Come in ! ( A pause  --  and another knock a trifle louder . ) Come in ! ( Mary opens the door  --  comes in and closes it softly . Without turning ) Well ? HARRINGTON Terry ! ( Terrance springs to his feet and stands staring at her . ) Do n't you know me ? TERRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till you understand . I 've seen Jack  --  he told me you needed someone to take care of your little girl . p. 61 TERRY ( Looking at the flower and back to her ) You  --  HARRINGTON Yes  --  I 've been here before . TERRY Is it  --  someone you know  --  you  --  HARRINGTON It 's myself  --  I want to come . TERRY What ? HARRINGTON Now that I 'm here , I do n't know whether I can say it or not . It seemed so easy and right  --  but it 's hard , after all . I  --  must work at something and I thought it would be easier to come to you than to anyone else in the world  --  because , in spite of everything , you could n't be proud , Terry  --  nor revengeful nor resenting . You could only be understanding  --  and know that , unless I 've grown wiser and sorry , and life meant a bigger , better thing to me than it used to , I would n't be here asking you to forgive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know I can be a little help to you . TERRY I  --  do n't seem to hear quite what you say . ( He looks at her , too dazed to speak , and she sits . ) To work ? What do you mean ? HARRINGTON Just that . It 's what I could do best  --  teach her  --  and make her what she ought to be . She 's a love  --  a love . p. 62 TERRY Come here ? ( She nods . ) Every day ? ( She nods . ) And  --  and  --  HARRINGTON For money  --  yes , like anyone else . Only I 'd do it so much better than anyone else . You do n't know , Terry , how very , very hard it is to get that sort of woman . Why , the taking care of a little tender child is the most precious work in the world . TERRY It is n't possible that you should do it . HARRINGTON Forget it 's me . Just see the sensible , practical , valuable side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am  --  when you might have had to take  --  oh , something quite dangerous and dreadful . Do n't think of anything but that  --  and you 'll get used to the rest . We  --  you  --  life 's full of facts and figures , Terry  --  we have to make up our minds to that . It wo n't be the old you and me . You 'll forget that . I wo n't trouble you . I 'll only be useful . Try me  --  try me  --  just for a little while to see how it goes . TERRY Your husband  --  is he well ? HARRINGTON Very . Your life 's going to be full and busy , Jack tells me  --  and you 've done a strange , wonderful , awful thing , in taking that child upon your shoulders . I could make it all very easy for you and right . Really I could . I hurt you once  --  selfishly , basely . You were hurt because you were fine and sweet , but that 's only a memory now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . It 's the future that matters  --  not the past  --  and I want to do something out of my experience of mistakes that will help you most . I can , because I understand you  --  and what you need most . Be big and sensible and let me. p. 63 TERRY ( Turning away ) Faith , ' t is a strange way you have of jumping over the years and saying this is past and that 's gone and the future must be so and so . You 've been living  --  I 've been alone , remembering . ' T is not so forgiving I am  --  as you think . You do n't know what I want or what I feel or what I need . You ca n't come knocking at a door that has been closed so long , and come into a roomful of ghosts and put ' em all about in a whisk  --  so and so . Life 's not quite so easy as that . I ca n't see it at all , Mary  --  what you suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Oh . . . I 've had two days to think about it , you see . I 've argued it all out and made it possible  --  it seems so right . TERRY Yes  --  but you argued it with yourself alone , with no one to take the other side . I ca n't see it . Life was once a beautiful thing between you and me . That 's gone  --  as you say  --  but because it 's dead and empty does n't mean we can begin again with another thing . It 'll have to stay as it is now . HARRINGTON Everything is possible  --  anything is possible  --  if we only throw away the dead things and take the new . I 'm sorry  --  if it ca n't be that way for us . May I see her  --  just once more  --  just a minute  --  the little girl ? p. 64 TERRY ( Calling ) Patsy  --  come here ! ( Patsy opens the door . ) Come in  --  just you . Shut the door . PATSY ( Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh  --  it 's the lovely lady ! HARRINGTON ( Putting out her hand ) I told you we might meet again  --  some way  --  somehow . Ready for bed ? PATSY Goodness , no ! I have n't had my supper . Could n't you stay and eat with me ? Terry-Lerry is going away and I 'll be all alone . HARRINGTON I wish I could . PATSY Ask her to  --  please , Uncle Terry . TERRY ( After a pause ) Could you ? HARRINGTON I could . TERRY Will you ? HARRINGTON I will . TERRY ( Looking at his watch ) It 's time I was gone now . PATSY Will you take off your hat ? p. 65 HARRINGTON Of course . ( She flings off her coat , hat and gloves quickly  --  and sits , taking Patsy in her arms . ) TERRY ( Strapping up his machine ) It 's off I am with Jack  --  to show a great man my invention . HARRINGTON Is that one of the ones I would n't believe in ? TERRY No  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the old . HARRINGTON You see  --  made because of the old . PATSY What 's your name ? HARRINGTON Mary . PATSY Mary  --  fairy ! HARRINGTON ( Laughing ) Yes . PATSY See my new slippers ? HARRINGTON How pretty . PATSY I love ' em . TERRY ( Having taken his machine and opened the hall door ) You 'll stay a little while  --  will you ? HARRINGTON A very  --  little while . I 'm sorry it ca n't be . Good-bye . p. 66 PATSY Ai n't you glad the lovely lady came back , Terry-Lerry ? TERRY I do n't know . CURTAIN FALLS AS HE GOES OUT . @x Time : One week later than Act II . Four o'clock in the afternoon . Place : Same as Act II . The room is transformed . The furniture arranged in a comfortable , intimate way  --  flowers and plants , books , magazines and papers are about  --  a number of dolls and a Teddy bear  --  a fire in the grate and a general air of home and a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the couch before the fire , sewing on a frock for Patsy . She is wearing a plain dark dress and a small white apron . Her face has more color and less sadness than before . Patsy is on a low seat before Mary , looking at a large picture-book  --  with a row of dolls on the floor before her . She wears a very charming , simple frock . Her hair is well brushed and she is as fresh and well-groomed as a rose . PATSY ( Reading ) C-a-t  --  Kitty . What does the kitty do ? HARRINGTON What do you think ? PATSY She 's jumping . HARRINGTON Um  --  un . PATSY P-l-a-y-s  --  jumping . Terry-Lerry does n't know how well I can read . HARRINGTON Lizzie is afraid I 'm making you too intellectual . Stand up a minute , dearest  --  please . p. 68 PATSY ( Standing while Mary holds the frock up to see the length ) Can I wear my sash with this one ? HARRINGTON That would spoil it . PATSY Why ? HARRINGTON Simple things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that out , does n't it ? PATSY How did you find out ? HARRINGTON By making a great , great mistake and wanting the sashes and showy things . It 's  --  turn ' round . The really beautiful things are in our hearts , my love . PATSY ( Trying to look at her heart ) But we ca n't see them . HARRINGTON Oh , yes , we can . But we have to learn to look with the eyes and the heart too  --  or else the things that are right before us  --  we do n't see at all . PATSY Can you see way into my heart ? HARRINGTON I can  --  and I see little Miss Kindness and little Miss Truth . Those are the things that last forever and ever and ever , Pittie-Pat . Nothing can take them away , and they can make other people so happy if only the other people are wise enough to know  --  before it 's too late . And they 're the only  --  only  --  only things that do make us happy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last button-hole , this will be finished . p. 69 PATSY ( Busily arranging the dolls ) Do you hear that , Hildegarde ? I have to look in your heart and see what 's in it . LIZZIE ( Coming in from bedroom  --  dressed in neat black with immaculate collar and cuffs ) Is it goin ' out again we are today at all ? ' T is four o'clock a'ready . HARRINGTON Oh , yes , Lizzie  --  go now . The sun wo n't last much longer . That is if you think best . LIZZIE Much it matters what I think around here any more . HARRINGTON It matters so much that no one could get on without you . LIZZIE Humph ! ( She turns grimly and starts back into the bedroom . There is a sharp knock at the hall door . Lizzie opens it and Jack McManners comes in quickly . ) MCMANNERS Is  --  Where 's Mr. O'Shaunnesey ? LIZZIE He ai n't here . MCMANNERS ( Moving down to speak to Mary ) He has an appointment . Did n't he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seen him today . p. 70 MCMANNERS ( Turning to Lizzie ) Did n't he ? LIZZIE He did not . Come , darlin ' . ( Patsy follows her into the bedroom . ) MCMANNERS He warned me that he always falls down at the top . But by Jove ! he 's the most unbusiness-like duffer I ever saw in my life . HARRINGTON Was it anything really important ? MCMANNERS Of course . I want another talk with him before he sees Stevenson again . I 'm doing everything in my power to push Terry along . HARRINGTON ( Drily ) I 'm sure you are . MCMANNERS What ? We 're all pushing a bit  --  are n't we ? Terry 's a very good proposition  --  now . Do n't you think so ? You were pretty darned clever , Mary , to  --  to do this . HARRINGTON What do you mean ? MCMANNERS You came back at just the right time and  --  in the smoothest way you could possibly have done it . HARRINGTON Oh  --  is that what you think ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 71 HARRINGTON How dare you say that to me ? How dare you ? MCMANNERS Oh , come now  --  do n't take that pose with me , my dear girl . HARRINGTON How can you think anything so contemptible ? MCMANNERS Oh , bosh ! I admire you for it . I take off my hat to you . HARRINGTON Oh , do n't . MCMANNERS The only thing I do n't see is why you have n't told him your husband is dead . Why you asked me to be mum about that . HARRINGTON So he could n't possibly think me as contemptible as you do . So he 'd know that I came for nothing on earth but honestly wanting to help him . MCMANNERS Oh , Mary  --  it 's all right . It 's all right , dear girl  --  but do n't expect me to believe that lofty and noble motive . HARRINGTON If you ca n't believe the simple decent fact you 're  --  Oh , it 's disgusting . MCMANNERS How long are you going to keep up the bluff ? When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me afraid to now . If you think I could be so horribly low as  --  He wo n't  --  he wo n't think it . p. 72 MCMANNERS Well , I do n't know . Terry 's pretty easy , I admit . But after all , he is human  --  and when a woman throws a man once because he 's a failure and then turns up again the minute he 's a success  --  why  --  HARRINGTON ( Rising ) Ca n't you believe that I 'm so sorry for what I did that I want him to know how ashamed of it I am  --  that I respect him and value his friendship and his forgiveness , and want to help him in the best way I can ? Ca n't you  --  ca n't you believe anything as open and honest as that ? MCMANNERS You 're a wonder . I 've always said you were darned clever , and I actually believe you can get away with it . ( There is a knock at the hall door . ) MCMANNERS Shall I open it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall door . ) BOY A gentleman to see Mr. O'Shaunnesey . MCMANNERS He is n't  --  Oh , hello , Lenox ! ( As Mr. Lenox appears in the doorway . ) Come in . O'Shaunnesey is n't here . Come in . Do you want me ? ( Mr. Lenox is a small , dapper man about fifty-five , very carefully dressed in good style and with a very quick and exact manner . He is just now very much excited. ) p. 73 LENOX If he is n't here , where on earth is he , then ? ( To Mary ) I beg your pardon . HARRINGTON He may come in at any moment . LENOX Extraordinary way to do business . I could n't even get you in your office all day , and I 've telephoned here a dozen times . Finally came out like an errand-boy . HARRINGTON But he did n't know  --  did he ? Who wants to see him ? MCMANNERS That 's all right . I 'll go down with you , Lenox . HARRINGTON Oh , no . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . No one will be in this room . ( She goes in R. , closing the door . ) LENOX ( Looking after her ) Wife ? MCMANNERS No  --  governess . What 's up ? LENOX Why do n't you keep hold of this damned Irishman ? Stevenson wants to see him , and he wants him in a hurry . MCMANNERS ( Excitedly ) Has Stevenson come to a decision ? LENOX Of course he has . And here you are dangling and have n't got your man ready for it . p. 74 MCMANNERS Is he going to take it ? Put it right through ? LENOX You 'll know soon enough . MCMANNERS Oh , bosh ! Do n't try that . There 's plenty in this for you , you know  --  if you come through . I want to know what 's up before I talk terms with Stevenson . ( Lenox hesitates . ) Do n't be a fool , Lenox . It 's up to you to put me wise . That 's your part of this job , or it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want your per cent or not ? What is it ? What 's up ? LENOX It 's bigger than I thought . MCMANNERS What ? LENOX Than I ever dreamed of . MCMANNERS What ? LENOX He 's had copper men with him today who say it will revolutionize copper and by-products . They 're talking in millions . MCMANNERS ( Under his breath ) I can sit tight , then , and hang on . LENOX You can if you can handle the Irishman and keep him from giving it away . MCMANNERS I 'll fix him . Are you sure , Lenox  --  are you sure ? No hot air ? p. 75 LENOX As sure as I ever was of anything in my life . I 've heard it all day . The only hitch will be O'Shaunnesey himself . It 's up to you to get him here quick . If he flounders all over the place  --  MCMANNERS Where on earth is he ? I could wring his neck ! Probably buying flowers instead of tending to his business . You go back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll have him there . If he does n't turn up pretty soon now , I 'll go myself , anyway . LENOX They do n't want you . They want him . MCMANNERS I know , but  --  LENOX You were a duffer to let him out of your sight . ( Patsy opens door at R. and stands listening . ) Why the devil did n't you keep your hands on him and have him ready for just this kind of thing ? MCMANNERS Tell them he 's coming . ( Lenox goes out . ) PATSY Is he scolding you ? MCMANNERS Yes  --  he 's scolding me because that confounded Uncle Terry of yours is up in a balloon instead of being here with his feet on the carpet . PATSY ( Going back into the room ) Oh , Mary-Fairy , Uncle Terry 's gone up in a balloon . p. 76 HARRINGTON ( Coming in from the right ) Is Terry really late for an important appointment ? MCMANNERS Yes , he is . That is , he was to meet me here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him . Ca n't you try to make him realize , Mary , that he must stop this infernally casual way of taking things if he expects me to make him a success ? HARRINGTON I do n't believe in his success . MCMANNERS What ? HARRINGTON I only hope you are n't leading him on into a fool 's paradise . You ought not to have let him think this is going to succeed . It 's a crime to raise his hopes again . He 's put his whole soul into it . This will be the bitterest , hardest disappointment of all . MCMANNERS You wait . You 'll see pretty soon now what I 've done for him . HARRINGTON What do you honestly think , Jack ? Is there the slightest chance of this big man Stevenson taking Terry 's invention ? Is there ? Do n't let Terry believe it if it is n't true . It would  --  He could n't bear another failure . MCMANNERS Just let me take care of this , if you do n't mind . And whatever happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to send some wires . I 'll watch for him down there . But if I miss him , for heaven 's sake keep him here and I 'll be back . ( He goes out . Mary after thinking a moment goes back to couch. ) p. 77 PATSY ( Coming in from R. ) I 'm ready . I 've put on my heavy boots . HARRINGTON That 's right , dear . PATSY Lizzie says for you to put on my hat , because if she does , you 'll put it on some other way . HARRINGTON ( Laughing ) Poor Lizzie ! Pittie-Pat , you must make Lizzie know every day how much you love her and need her . LIZZIE ( Coming back wearing her own coat and hat and carrying Patsy 's coat ) Here you are . Come and git into it . PATSY ( Going to put on her coat ) I love you very much , Lizzie-Tizzie , every day . LIZZIE You do ? Sure , ' t is easy fer you to love anything  --  anything at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back is turned to them . ) PATSY Oh , no , it is n't . I only love people with nice things in their hearts . I 'll have to look in yours . LIZZIE You need n't mind . Here  --  here 's your gloves . ( Terrance comes in from the hall , with a few flowers in a paper. ) p. 78 PATSY Oh  --  it 's Terry-Lerry ! Goodie  --  goodie ! ( A pause as they all look at him . Terrance takes off his hat , looking a trifle shy and conscious . ) LIZZIE ( Insinuatingly ) ' T is back very early you are . TERRY I 'm leaving again in a few minutes . Is it going for a walk you are , Patsy ? PATSY Could n't you come , too ? TERRY Faith , child , I wish I could . I 've got another job than that . PATSY Bye-bye ! I wo n't be long . ( Going to kiss Mary and then Terrance . ) Bye-bye . Could n't you wait till I come back ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . You 've got plenty to take care of you now . LIZZIE Plenty . ( She goes to the door , waiting for Patsy . ) PATSY ( Going out ) Bye-bye , Mary-fairy . HARRINGTON Au revoir . LIZZIE Sure , you ai n't goin ' away fer a year , you know  --  wid your good-byeing . ( Lizzie goes out after Patsy , closing the door. ) p. 79 TERRY ( After a pause ) I 'm going out again . HARRINGTON Are you ? TERRY I came back to get my model . HARRINGTON Oh , yes . ( She sits by the fire again and goes on with her sewing . ) TERRY I was passing the flowers and  --  and  --  HARRINGTON I see . Shall I put them in water ? TERRY You might . ( Mary , taking a bowl from the mantel , goes to table by sofa and , filling it with water from the water-bottle on the table , puts the flowers into it . She bends over , smelling them . They are the same as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  very extravagant . TERRY Sure , they were giving them away on the corner . ( He still stands center , watching her . ) HARRINGTON They 're very beautiful , and I love them and appreciate your thoughtfulness  --  but please do n't do it again . TERRY And why not ? p. 80 HARRINGTON Because  --  it 's  --  it 's  --  it is extravagant . TERRY Sure , ' t was nothing at all they cost . HARRINGTON The room is full of flowers , anyway . Please  --  please do n't do it again , Terrance . TERRY Faith , I will if I want to . And why not , pray ? Why such airs all of a sudden ? HARRINGTON I  --  wo n't accept any more . TERRY You will that . And let me tell you one other thing . You 'll have a taxi at night when you 're going home . HARRINGTON Oh  --  TERRY You 'll not go out alone again at night . That 's settled . HARRINGTON Are you ready ? Jack has been here and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure I 'm ready  --  and waiting for him , the loafer ! Do you hear me ? ' T is foolish airs and nonsense you 're putting on for sensible old friends  --  like us . You 'll have the taxi , I say . HARRINGTON Please do n't speak of it again . TERRY Faith , I will  --  every day . Will you tell me any reason in God 's world why I should n't bring you all the flowers in town and send you home in a coach  --  if I want to ? Are you going to be sensible , now  --  or not ? p. 81 HARRINGTON But it is n't sensible . It 's  --  it 's quite impossible . TERRY Is it , now ? And are n't you after telling me a week ago  --  anything  --  everything is possible if we only throw away the wrong things and take the right ? HARRINGTON Oh  --  TERRY Were n't you after saying only the truth and not the form of a thing matters ? HARRINGTON Yes  --  but  --  TERRY Were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand on old bitter things and refuse to let you come here  --  keeping away from Patsy the thing she needed most ? HARRINGTON But  --  TERRY After making me see it  --  making me let you come  --  after making me see that a friendship built on understanding and faith is worth all the  --  all the  --  everything else in the world , is it fair to turn like this ? It 's falling down you are from the very things you made me see I was a fool for doubting . HARRINGTON Oh , Terry  --  Terry ! How good you are ! But it ca n't be . This is different . TERRY ( Crosses left ) What 's different ? p. 82 HARRINGTON ( Crosses C. ) It 's so nice of you not to see . But anyway  --  you 're spending too much money . TERRY ' T is none of your business how much I 'm spending . That 's what money 's for  --  to spend . HARRINGTON ( Sits center ) Oh , I know  --  I know , Terry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw it go and go  --  and go  --  till there was nothing . That 's where the pinch comes , and the agony . TERRY And that was my fault . If I 'd had this money when I should have had it  --  you 'd have been spared all that . ' T is a great deal I owe you , Mary , and a settlement I 'm going to make upon you . HARRINGTON No one but you could reason like that , Terry . God bless you ! I know you , you see , and it frightens me to see you spend it like this . TERRY Then you 're taking fright at nothing at all . Do n't you know yet I 'm making my fortune ? HARRINGTON Well , are you ? Is it settled ? Has it all gone through  --  safe and sound and solid  --  so you 're sure of it ? TERRY Faith , you talk like a miser , Mary . Of course , I 'm sure . That is  --  as sure as a man can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Sits center ) Oh , your faith , Terrance ! What makes you think it will be all right ? What have they actually said to you ? TERRY Do you think a man like that wastes his time on a thing unless he believes in it ? HARRINGTON No , no  --  of course not  --  but what  --  TERRY Do you think Jack puts money in a thing unless he 's sure ? HARRINGTON Has he put money in it ? TERRY He has . HARRINGTON Much ? TERRY Enough to show what he thinks . Enough to hold his share so nobody else can get hold of it . HARRINGTON What ? TERRY If he wants a half-interest , he must think it 's worth something . HARRINGTON ( Rises ) Has Jack bought a half-interest ? TERRY A  --  he 's  --  to have it . HARRINGTON How ? TERRY Did n't I tell you he 'd paid enough to hold it ? p. 84 HARRINGTON Then he will buy it ? TERRY He 's to have it . HARRINGTON Have it ? How ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did n't he get to Stevenson and bring it all about ? Sure , if it was n't for him there 'd be no  --  HARRINGTON Do you mean you 're giving him a half-interest ? TERRY Certainly I am . HARRINGTON ( Crosses to chair before fire ) Do you mind telling me how much money Jack has put into this ? TERRY ( Sits L. end of couch ) One thousand dollars he 's given me . HARRINGTON After Stevenson had seen it  --  or before ? TERRY After . HARRINGTON Stevenson was interested  --  then he knew . You have n't promised him half ? TERRY Certainly I have  --  and put my name to it . HARRINGTON Terry , be very , very careful . Perhaps you have done a great thing after all and Jack 's trying to get too much of it . p. 85 TERRY How you go on ! Sure , ' t is only half he 's getting , and deserves it . HARRINGTON Deserves it ! TERRY And the other half will be a fortune for me  --  and John Megaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me  --  and you expect to make Patsy an heiress . Oh  --  oh  --  oh  --  I do n't know whether to laugh or to cry . TERRY You seem to be doing a little of both . HARRINGTON Oh , the pity of you and the sweetness of you ! Terry , Terry , there 's nobody like you ! TERRY ( Rises and crosses to table at left ) And I suppose you think a damned good thing that is . ( She laughs and cries a little and tries to take up her sewing . ) May I ask you a question , Mary ? You  --  are you very miserable ? HARRINGTON Oh , no  --  not now . TERRY ( Standing back of chair C. ) But you  --  you 've been unhappy ? HARRINGTON Y  --  e  --  s . But that 's over . I 'm very , happy  --  now . p. 86 TERRY You do n't mind my asking ?

TERRY But you  --  HARRINGTON Now  --  now  --  you promised . We 'll never speak of that again . TERRY ( Back of chair ) All right . That 's a bargain . I 'll just do the things I want to do and we 'll say nothing at all about it . Look at me . Look at me , I say . ( She turns slowly . ) If it is n't right for me to do a bit of kindness for you  --  then the world is a bitter , sorry place , with no truth nor sweetness in it . Is n't that so ? Is n't it ? Answer me . ( They look deeply at each other. ) p. 87 MCMANNERS ( Knocking and opening the door ) Hello , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . TERRY He does ? MCMANNERS Come on . I 'd hate to be late for this gentleman . He would n't stand much fooling with his time . TERRY ( Getting his hat ) Is he going to take it ? MCMANNERS Looks like it . TERRY ( Sorting some sketches on the table ) Sure , my heart 's pounding like a hammer . I do n't know whether my tongue will go or not when I get there . ( Tightening the straps on the model . ) MCMANNERS You 've got your chance now  --  it 's up to you to  --  handle it right . And hurry a little , will you ? TERRY My hands are shaking so I ca n't fasten the thing . MCMANNERS ( Starting to help ) Oh  --  TERRY All right  --  all right . Come on . Wish me good luck , Mary . I 'm off for the top of the mountain at last . A long road it 's been , eh ? p. 88 HARRINGTON I wish you good luck  --  and God bless you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Oh  --  o-o-o ! TERRY ( Quickly taking Patsy in his arms ) Be quiet ! ( To the boy ) What is it ? BOY She was knocked down in the street . ( Lizzie starts to wail again . Mary stops her sharply , moves swiftly to the sofa , arranging the pillows . Terrance puts Patsy on it , kneeling beside her . They all watch breathlessly , Mary standing back of sofa , leaning over . ) TERRY ( Bending over Patsy and brushing her hair away from her face and speaking very softly ) Patsy , little girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( A pause . He bends closer , putting a hand on her heart . ) Get a doctor  --  quick ! ( Jack motions the Boy out . Lizzie drops in a chair by the door , rocking back and forth , moaning , her head in her hands . Mary goes quickly into the bedroom . Terrance feels Patsy 's limbs to see if one is broken. ) p. 89 LIZZIE ( Wailing softly ) Oh , the blessed Virgin save her ! ' T was just crossin ' the street we were and she darted ahead of me . I always hold her tight . Patsy  --  Patsy  --  why was n't it me ? Poor old worthless Lizzie , that would give her life so quick fer you ! Oh-o-o-o ! TERRY Do n't , Lizzie , do n't ! ( Mary comes back with smelling-salts and a spoonful of brandy  --  going to end of couch , she helps Terrance give them to Patsy . ) She has n't moved . ( Patsy moves a little . ) Thank God ! MCMANNERS ( Coming back ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . How  --  is  --  she ? Unconscious ? ( Terrance goes on working with Patsy , not answering . Jack stands anxiously waiting , turning away to look at his watch . ) TERRY Patsy , ca n't you speak to me , dearie ? Do you hear me ? ( Another breathless pause as they watch her . ) PATSY ( Without opening her eyes ) Mother ! ( Terrance lifts her hand to his lips. ) p. 90 TERRY Mary  --  Mary  --  how bad do you think it is ? HARRINGTON ( Trying not to cry ) Ca n't she speak to you ? Talk to her , Terry . ( Mary , unable to speak , puts her hands on Patsy 's feet . ) TERRY Pitty-Pat  --  look at me ! Ca n't you ? Wo n't you open your eyes ? ( He sings very softly snatches of the song he has sung to her in Act II . She moves a trifle again .

( He sinks with his arms about Patsy as the ) CURTAIN FALLS @x Time : Five days later . Late afternoon . Place : The sitting-room in Mary 's flat . It is a small room on the top floor of an old house in lower New York , with a few beautiful things , left from Mary 's prosperous days . The draperies and walls are soft in tone . The mantel-piece is an old white marble one , with a small grate . The books , piano , flowers , etc. , give the room the air of comfort and home , expressive of Mary 's personality , stamped with distinction and individuality . At Curtain : Mary and Jack are in the room . Mary on the couch , Jack in a chair facing her . HARRINGTON But he could n't . He could n't leave Patsy . You could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Patsy while she was in danger . He could n't leave her . MCMANNERS Yes , but  --  that 's all very well  --  but it ruined everything . HARRINGTON Do you mean to tell me that Stevenson has lost all interest in a thing which he was ready to invest in  --  merely because Terrance did n't see him that day ? MCMANNERS That day  --  nor the next  --  nor the next  --  five , it 's been . He threw away his chance  --  simply threw it away . p. 93 HARRINGTON If your great Mr. Stevenson is so changeable as all that , I 'm afraid he was n't as interested in the first place as you seemed to think . MCMANNERS Regardless of how you reason it , my dear , the fact remains that he was ready to sign contracts that day  --  and Terry ruined the whole thing . Not going the one time was all right  --  but five days  --  Great guns ! It 's the limit ! Terry 's a sentimental idiot and that 's all there is about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was his love and tenderness that saved Patsy . As soon as he knew she was out of danger , as soon as the doctor said her back would be all right , we brought her here  --  yesterday it was . Terry 's mind is relieved now  --  so he can go on with his business again . MCMANNERS You said in your note you had a suggestion to make . HARRINGTON If the great Stevenson went as far as that with it , someone else can be interested , too . MCMANNERS That 's easy enough to say . I do n't know whether I can make anyone else believe in it or not . HARRINGTON I happened to find out the other day that you paid Terry a thousand dollars as an option on it after Stevenson had seen it  --  so that was pretty good proof that Stevenson had told you it was a great thing . p. 94 MCMANNERS ( After a pause ) Just what 's your idea  --  Mary dear ? HARRINGTON This . When I found that out , I went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest and you 've tried to trick Terry out of the whole thing . MCMANNERS ( Controlling himself and trying to seem amused ) Well , really  --  your feminine business ability quite staggers me . And what did he tell you ? HARRINGTON He told me to send Terry to him tomorrow , that he is going to patent the machine , and thinks it 's a great invention and will make Terry 's fortune , and I believe you have been trying to get the whole thing away from Terry . I just wanted to let you know that it ca n't be done . MCMANNERS You 're fooled this time . HARRINGTON How ? MCMANNERS So Stevenson has taken you in , too . Made you believe he 's going to take the invention ? HARRINGTON I believe in him absolutely . MCMANNERS Stevenson has got all he wanted to know out of you and fooled you beautifully . p. 95 HARRINGTON I believe in Stevenson . I do ! I do ! MCMANNERS All right . See where he 'll land you . HARRINGTON Stay and talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MCMANNERS ( Going ) You 've got Stevenson  --  you do n't need me . ( He goes out through hall quickly . Mary closes the door , stopping by it a moment , thinking  --  then goes quickly to the bedroom door , opening it very carefully . ) HARRINGTON Oh  --  she 's awake . Hello , sweetheart ! Bring her out , Lizzie , and she 'll be all ready for Terry-Lerry . ( Mary goes to the couch , arranging the pillows , goes into bedroom and comes out with two in dainty muslin covers , patting them into place with the others  --  moving quickly and excitedly about the room , touching and moving things here and there . Taking the flowers from the piano to the table and then putting them back again , having studied the effect . She herself is wearing a simple gown which blends softly into the tones of the room , making her seem a part of it . Lizzie comes from the bedroom carrying Patsy tenderly . Patsy is wearing a rose-colored wrapper over her nighty and an adorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( As she puts Patsy down ) ' T is gettin ' out o ' wan soft nest into another you are , darlin ' . Ai n't that like the down on the back of the swan , now ? PATSY ( Nestling into the pillows ) It 's lovely . This is a pretty house to live in , Mary-Fairy . HARRINGTON ( Going to look at Patsy ) Do you like it , my love ? I 'm glad . PATSY Oh , see the sunshine ! It 's dancing on the carpet ! HARRINGTON That 's what you 'll soon be doing . LIZZIE Heaven be praised ! HARRINGTON Doctor says that little back is going to be strong and well as ever . PATSY Are n't you glad , Hildegarde ? I must wash your apron tomorrow . You look very  --  very untidy . LIZZIE ( Putting the doll in Patsy 's arms ) Why would n't she ? Grievin ' and sighin ' an ' cryin ' ' er eyes out fer you , she 's been . PATSY Nobody can take care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sayin ' that to me  --  only yesterday  --  no , ' t was the day before , it was . She says , says she  --  Lizzie , I ai n't feelin ' good . Me back aches an ' me head aches an ' I 'm in a terrible bad way . An ' do you know what it was she said it was would cure her  --  an ' nothin ' else in the world a-tall ? p. 97 PATSY What ? LIZZIE The lovin ' arms o ' Miss Patsy O'Shaunnesey . An ' , be gorrah ! look at ' er now . Ai n't she the smilin ' , happy thing  --  at the touch of you ? Ai n't ' er heart beatin ' to music  --  wid you lookin ' into ' er eyes ? An '  --  ai n't the whole world doin ' the same thing , because you 're smilin ' at us , darlin ' ? Ai n't your Lizzie the happiest of ' em all  --  ( Lizzie 's voice stops with tears . She turns away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) You crying , Lizzie ? LIZZIE ( Brushing the tears away ) I am not . Sure , I got somethin ' in me eye as big as a house . ( Mary , who has stood at the window with her back to the others , now turns , laughing and wiping her own tears away . ) HARRINGTON We 've all got something in our eyes today , have n't we , Lizzie ? But they 're happy ones . Listen  --  the bell is going to  --  ( A bell rings . ) There it is . That 's Terry-Lerry . Open the door for him , Lizzie . ( Lizzie hurries out through hall . Mary goes to give a final touch to Patsy 's cap , kissing her with excited happiness. ) p. 98 PATSY You 've got roses in your cheeks . HARRINGTON And in my heart . PATSY Why ? HARRINGTON You made them bloom . PATSY I think you 're a pretty lady , Mary-fairy . HARRINGTON Do you , dear ? I 'm glad . PATSY ( Calling ) Terry-Lerry ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary goes quickly to the fire . ) TERRY ( Coming in from hall quickly ) I 'm coming as fast as ever I can . Close your eyes and do n't open them till I 'm there . ( Patsy closes her eyes . He comes in quickly with a pink rose in his hand , going to couch and touching her lips with the rose . ) PATSY I know ! It 's a rose ! TERRY Right you are ! ( Holding up the rose ) I said to the old woman when she held this out to me : Sure I 'll take it . I 'm going to some one who looks just like that . And is n't it the truth  --  if ever I spoke it ? ( Putting the rose against Patsy 's cheek ) p. 99 PATSY It 's Mary-Fairy . TERRY Eh ? ( Looking at Mary ) Be dad  --  it 's the two of you ! ( Mary and Patsy laugh . ) HARRINGTON We like that , do n't we ? TERRY Why , faith , ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's done it . There 's healing in places . ( Looking slowly about the room . ) HARRINGTON Only a few things I loved most  --  saved out of the wreck  --  and the top floor of this old house has a nice , comfortable way with it that makes us suit each other . TERRY That 's it . It suits you . It speaks softly without words  --  like you . ( Looking at Patsy ) She was a fairy , was n't she , to bring you here ? PATSY Of course . ( Mary goes to sit by the window  --  taking her basket of sewing from the window-seat , and begins darning a small white stocking . Lizzie comes from the hall , going toward the bedroom door . ) TERRY How does it feel , Lizzie , to be in a place that shakes hands with you and says  --  ' t is good to be alive ? Eh ? p. 100 LIZZIE ( Stopping near the bedroom door ) What 's that , sir ? TERRY Nothing  --  of any importance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure , most of the talk in the world is that . TERRY Would you be willing to stay in New York now , Lizzie ? Or is it wedded to Spring Hollow you are ? LIZZIE I ca n't say that either Spring Holler or New York has done so much fer me that I need to crack me brain choosin ' between ' em . Is it thinkin ' o ' stayin ' here you are ? TERRY Thinking  --  yes . LIZZIE Where iver she is  --  is the right place  --  fer me . You  --  beggin ' your pardon  --  you wo n't let her git too tired wid the fun o ' sittin ' up ? Will you ? TERRY You 're the boss , Lizzie . LIZZIE ( Sarcastically ) Yes , I am . Sure , I did n't mind givin ' up in some ways  --  once I seen she knowed a few things better than me . ' T is a poor fool do n't know a bigger man than hisself once he sees it . ( She goes into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pointing to the other end of the couch ) You must sit there . TERRY Yes , your majesty . ( He sits with rigid dignity ) A fine day it is  --  without  --  and still finer within . PATSY You have n't said how-do-you-do to Hildegarde . TERRY Think of that , now ! ( Shakes hands with Hildegarde . ) I hope you 're well , ma'am ? You 're looking a bit seedy  --  but if your health is sturdy , ' t is no matter . PATSY ( In a squeaky voice for Hildegarde ) I 'm well . TERRY Thank God for that ! ' T is the real bog turf you are , Hildegarde , a bit of the old sod . PATSY She wants you to tell her a story  --  quick . TERRY She do ? But ' t is very hard of hearing she is at times . PATSY Oh , do n't hurt her feelings . TERRY Not for the whole world . Mary  --  Mary  --  what does anything else matter with the priceless thing sitting here ? HARRINGTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful to tell you when Patsy 's tired of you . p. 102 TERRY It could n't be as wonderful as what I 'm going to tell you . HARRINGTON But not as wonderful as mine . It could n't be . TERRY Oh , yes , it could . HARRINGTON What ? PATSY We 're waiting for the story . TERRY To be sure ! And which one will you have ? PATSY You know . The nicest . The one we love most . Do n't we , Hildegarde ? TERRY Sure , ' t is a very large frog I have in my throat . PATSY Tell him to hop out quick . TERRY ' T is always very quick you want things . Sometimes waiting makes them better . ( Mary looks at Terrance . ) PATSY No . TERRY Well , now , how does it begin ? ( Patsy starts the song for him . Terrance goes on with it , including Hildegarde in his audience . ) PATSY I love it ! Sing it again , please . ( Terrance sings another verse. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terrance finishes ) Thank you . Hildegarde says thank you , too . TERRY And I think Hildegarde is getting a little bit tired . PATSY ( Her head going into the pillow ) Oh , no . HARRINGTON ( Putting down her sewing and going to Patsy ) Remember what Lizzie said . See , Hildegarde 's eyes are almost shut  --  the sandman is coming so fast . Uncle Terry will come and see his children tomorrow . TERRY I 'll be standing on the door-sill , waiting to be let in  --  before you 've had time to wink your eye . HARRINGTON ( Having gone to open the bedroom door ) If you 'll carry them in they 'll be more comfortable in bed again . ( Lizzie comes in from the bedroom and goes above couch , taking the two pillows which Mary brought in . ) TERRY Are you ready , ladies ? ( He lifts Patsy and the doll . ) PATSY Be careful of Hildegarde 's back . p. 104 TERRY I will that ! Are you comfortable , Hildy-Bildy ? PATSY ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bedroom ) Look at Hildegarde hitting me in the eye ! ' T is a good Irish fist she has ! ( He goes in . ) LIZZIE A grand man he is  --  with the heart of a child . Many a night I laid awake wondering what would become of Patsy  --  and him not dreamin ' the load he 'd took on his back . But somehow he 's one of the kind that providence takes care of . And it seems like the Lord had you up his sleeve  --  all the time  --  to slip out when you was most needed . HARRINGTON I  --  wish  --  I  --  could believe that , Lizzie . LIZZIE And why would n't you believe it ? The only thing I 'm worrying about is  --  it ca n't go on ferever . If there was some arrangement could keep it goin ' . HARRINGTON That would be  --  wonderful , would n't it ? LIZZIE It would that . If only you was n't encumbered with another husband  --  you could n't do better . ( Nodding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) ( Mary stands waiting  --  excitedly . After a moment Terrance comes back . He closes the door and comes further into the room . Seeing Mary waiting , he stops . They look at each other for a moment. ) p. 105 HARRINGTON Well , I 'm going to tell my news first . TERRY No , you 're not  --  because what I have to tell you changes anything and everything . HARRINGTON It could n't . What I have to tell will make over the world for you . TERRY It could n't . ( Mary sits on chair at R. of couch . Terrance sits at R. end of couch . ) HARRINGTON Go fast , then  --  I ca n't wait . TERRY ( Much excited ) I thought the great chance of my life for money had come and gone  --  lost  --  with something far more precious left in its place  --  HARRINGTON Yes ? TERRY When Jack told me it was all over  --  that Stevenson had changed  --  I began to see that the loss meant I could n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of that now . You do n't need to  --  TERRY Eh ? HARRINGTON Go on  --  but do n't be unhappy and afraid . It 's going to be  --  Go on . p. 106 TERRY ' T was hard to believe that a man like Stevenson could go so far and throw it all up because I could n't go to him for a few days  --  when he knew the reason . HARRINGTON I 'm glad you saw that . TERRY I began to think maybe Jack had taken advantage of me . HARRINGTON Oh  --  do you know ? TERRY What ? HARRINGTON Nothing . Go on . TERRY And I accused him of this . HARRINGTON Good ! TERRY I was going to Stevenson myself . HARRINGTON Did you ? TERRY When Jack showed me how wrong I was and proved his good friendship all over again . HARRINGTON What ? TERRY What do you suppose he did yesterday  --  Jack ? HARRINGTON What ? TERRY He took all the risk on his own shoulders  --  and bought it himself . HARRINGTON ( Rising ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bought it ? Bought it ? For how much ? TERRY ( Rising ) For ten thousand dollars . HARRINGTON Oh , no ! Oh , no ! TERRY All of that  --  the fine , splendid friend he is . HARRINGTON Terrance  --  you  --  you did n't let him ! TERRY Do you think it was too much I let him pay ? ( Mary sits quickly , turning her back to Terrance . ) I was overcome , too  --  with the relief and the joy of it . Instead of more uncertainty and struggle  --  there it was , safe and sure . Not such a great sum as we talked about when we were excited and hope ran high and we thought in great figures . But enough to make her secure and happy till I can make more . HARRINGTON Oh , Terrance ! TERRY What is it , Mary dear ? HARRINGTON What if Jack is n't taking any risk ? What if Stevenson is going to patent it , after all  --  and Jack knows that and has got it away from you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your head . I 'd rather be dead than think the man lives who could do that to me  --  looking into my eyes as a friend . The agony it was when I doubted him ! No  --  no  --  no  --  I 'm sure now  --  and he 's saved me. p. 108 HARRINGTON Oh , Terry ! TERRY I 'd rather have the smaller sum  --  and know nothing can take it away from her  --  than to go on with the brilliant hopes . That was all right for me  --  but this is different . It 's for her now  --  a little child . HARRINGTON ( Throwing out her arms desperately and moving away  --  with a sob ) Oh , but what you 've lost ! It 's horrible  --  I ca n't bear it ! TERRY ( After a pause ) Mary , do you still think money is the most important thing in the world ? HARRINGTON ( Going to him quickly ) I did n't mean that , Terrance dear , I did n't . You must believe me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  compared with other things . TERRY ( Quietly  --  wistfully ) Oh , the sweetness of life when it 's free enough from both money and need to see the beauty , the beauty which is in feeling . That 's what life is  --  what we feel and dream and believe  --  not what we own . Nothing really great and beautiful was ever measured by money  --  never . If what I 've done ever makes somebody rich  --  the real value of it will be that what I believed in  --  was true . Do you think that , Mary ? p. 109 HARRINGTON ( Bowing her head ) Of course . TERRY Sit down . I have something  --  to ask you . ( Mary sits on the couch at left . Terrance goes to stand at the right end of it . ) There 's ten thousand dollars . Two of it I will send to John Megaw  --  one because it 's his and the other because  --  Well , because he loaned the one to me . ( Mary laughs . Terrance sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand I give to you  --  HARRINGTON Oh  --  TERRY To take care of Patsy  --  ' twill last in your wise hands till I can make more . HARRINGTON Oh  --  TERRY Wait , now . And more I will make because I have her  --  to do it for . If you 'll keep Lizzie  --  and spend it all as you think best  --  making things easier for yourself  --  I 'd stick at another thing I have in my head  --  till it 's perfected  --  and what I 've just gone through will give me courage to believe in success . What do you say ? Do n't you call that good fortune and very wonderful ? HARRINGTON If it is to you  --  yes . Good fortune is what we think it is  --  as you say . p. 110 TERRY Exactly . Will you do it , Mary ? HARRINGTON And what are you  --  going to do ? Go  --  back west to work  --  and  --  live on  --  nothing at all ? TERRY ( Rising and going slowly above couch ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her  --  to work . I do n't believe I could go back to that desolate old room again  --  after seeing  --  this . But  --  I 'll be somewhere 's about  --  busy and  --  happy  --  with a reason and a blessed meaning for living and working . Faith  --  it was a great  --  great high spot in my life  --  when Patsy came into it  --  and seeing you again , Mary , has been another . Let me say it  --  just once . When I tried to make you think you were blotted out and I had grown hard  --  I was trying to hide it  --  which was foolish and stupid . Why should I hide it ? My love for you has been a strong , steady flame  --  lighting the dark places  --  and it will go on filling them all with light now . God bless you , Mary  --  and  --  good-bye  --  for  --  perhaps a  --  some time . I 'd rather not see  --  her again . You tell her .

HARRINGTON I 've been waiting to hear you say it . TERRY Mary  --  do n't . Let it alone now . Let it be  --  as it is . HARRINGTON ( Going to him ) Oh , Terrance , dear  --  I 'm free . I 'm free , or I would n't have come . He  --  died  --  three years ago . TERRY ( In a whisper ) What ? HARRINGTON I  --  do n't deserve this  --  the blessing of your love . Oh  --  what suffering has taught me , dear  --  to know you and to love you  --  and to want you  --  to need you ! TERRY Mary ! HARRINGTON I love you , dear  --  I love you . TERRY I  --  ca n't believe it . HARRINGTON ( Going close to him ) This is the most wonderful of all  --  is n't it ? The priceless thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Terry , dear  --  I 'm so sorry for all the precious years I 've wasted for us . I want to make them up . Let me ! Let me !

( He kisses her . ) More beautiful  --  more wonderful  --  dearer than before ! My love  --  my sweetheart ! HARRINGTON This is life  --  Terrance ! TERRY Yes  --  this is life . Sometimes it all comes true . HARRINGTON Sometimes  --  ( She kisses him again and goes to the piano , playing a few strains of a song . ) Do you remember , dear ? TERRY ( Going to lean over the piano ) Do I remember ? It 's never been out of my heart a minute  --  not a minute .
