Eno:a the southern twilight of my early childhood memories there blazes out the recollection of a tragedy which , Lime and again , returns to trouble the dreams of my old age . I was an eyewitness of the blowing up and destruction by fire of the Princess , the finest steamboat on t he Mississippi in those days . ' ' he night before the disaster my father and mother had kissed me goodbye and gone on board of an old dismantled steam boat , which answered the purposes of a wharf , to await the arrival of the Princess , as they intended to take passage on her for New Orleans . Early the next , morning I wont down to the river to find out if they had yet left . The Princess had just drawn out into the stream , and as I stood watching her as she glided down the river , a great column of white smoke suddenly went up from her and she burst into ( lames . She was loaded with cotton . As though by magic the inhabitants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd I spied my brother-in-law , Charles La None , in a buggy . He called to tile . I jumped in alongside him and we dashed down the river road in the direction of the burning boat . The road was rough and the horse was fast . The high levee on our right shut out the view of the river so t hat we could see only the great coil ' ? L. 119 - NO . Iumn of smoke . On our left were the endless fields of sugar-cane , with an occasional glimpse of a planter 's house set in a grove of pecan trees . At last , in a great state of excitement , We arrived at the plantation of Mr. Conrad . Brother Charlie ' jumped out . of t he vehicle and ran toward the house , while I made t he horse fast . to a tree . then mounted t Ile levee , frOln Where I could see floating bales with people on them ; men in skill 's , from both sides of the river , were rescuing the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levee 1 rushed into the park in front , of Mr. Conrad 's residence , and there saw a sight which can never be effaced from my memory . Mr. Conrad had had sheds laid on the ground amid the trees , and barrels of flour were broken open and the contents poured over the sheets . As fast as the burned and scalded people Were pulled out of t he river t hey were seized by I he slaves , and , while screaming and shrieking with pain ruin fright , they were forcibly thrown down on t he sheets and rolled in the flour . The clothes had been burned off of many of them . Some , in their agony , could not , lie still , and , with the white sheets wrapped round them , looking like ghosts , they danced a wild hornpipe while filling the air with their screams . Terrified by the awful and uncanny scene , I hid behind a huge tree , so that I should not see it , but no tree could prevent me from hearing those awful cries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenly , to my horror , one of the white spectres , wrapped in a sheet , his disfigured face plastered with flour , staggered toward my hiding-place , and before I could run away from the hideous object , it extended its arms toward tore and quietly said , ' Do n't be afraid , Jimmie . It is me , Mr. Cheatham . I am dying , ? hold my hand ! ' And he sank on the turf beside me . Although dreadfully frightened , I managed between sobs to ask the question uppermost . in my mind : ' Can you tell MC where I can find my father and mother ? ' The ghostlike man replied with a cry which scented to wrench his soul front his body , shivered for an instant , and then lay still . A slave pass-Mg by pointed to the body and casually remarked , ' He done dead . ' A Creole negro woman then came running toward me ; she was stout and almost out of breath , but was still able to shout out to MO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; M'sieur La Noue lit clue to vinit unite suite ! ' When I found Brother Charlie , he was ministering to the maimed , but found time to tell me that my parents had taken another boat , and thereby had saved their lives . I returned at once to my home , where I was comforted in the strong arms of Katish , my old black nurse . These vivid leaves , taken at random from the first chapters of Colonel Morgan 's memoirs , set the pace , so to speak , for a life-record of adventure that stands out even in these days , when our ability to react to the prodigies of modern warfare is almost exhausted . James Morris Morgan , as he tells its in the earlier pages of his recollections , was born in New Orleans in 1845 ? the spoiled youngest child of a large family which , when the great decision of 1860 came , was divided against itself . Willful and high-spirited , his first education was drawn largely from the racing stables of his relatives , on whose grea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was offered all ajmointinent as midshipman at Annapolis . The possibilities of a roving sea-life made an instant appeal to him , and , after much trial and tribulation , he squeezed past the examining board into the Naval Academy , where he found himself aboard the school-ship Constitution , with a number of boys as green as himself . Among these were Charles S. Clark , who brought the Oregon round South America during the Spanish War ; Robley I ) . Evans , better known later as ' Fighting Bob ' , Sigsbee , of the Al.aine tragedy in Havana harbor ; Gridley , commander of Dewey 's flagship at . Manila Bay , and others of equal note . Young Morgan was in the midst of his training when the war broke out ? but . here he takes up his own story . By the end of 1860 a dark cloud had settled over our spirits and we no longer spent our few moments of leisure in skylarking , but , instead , discussed the burning question of secession . We did not know anything about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to compose a separate nation . Harry Taylor , afterwards rear-admiral , who was from the District of Columbia , said that he was going with New York because that state had more commerce than any other one , and necessarily would have the biggest navy . He was promptly called down by being informed that no one would be allowed to join any state except the one he was born in , and he was further humiliated by a much-traveled boy who asserted that he had been in Washington , and that t he District of Columbia had only one lit Ile steamboat out of which to make a navy , and that one ran between Washington and Acquits Creek , and she was nal en . Personally , I was insulted by being informed that Louisiana lied been purchased by the money of the other st tes just as a man buys a farm , and that ? therefore , she had no right to secede . This was said in retort . after I had made the boast that by rights many of t he states belonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after day , un- the news came that South Carolina had in reality seceded , and the boys from that state promptly resigned and went home . Then followed the news of t he firing on Fort Sumter . The rest of the lads from the Sou di resigned as rapidly as they could get permission from home to do so ? I among the rest . I passed over the side of the old Constitution and out of the United States Navy , with a big lump in my throat , which I vainly endeavored to swallow , for I had many very clear friends tonong the northern boys ? in fact , affectionate friendships , some interrupted by death but a few others which have lasted for more than half a century . To my surprise , my captain , George Rodgers , accompanied me ashore and to the railway station , telling me , as I walked beside him , that the trouble would end in a few weeks , and that I had made a great mistake , but that even then it was not too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we passed through the old gate opening into the town , ? the gate which I was not to pass through again until my head was white , fifty years afterwards , ? and walked along the street , Captain Rodgers kindly took my hand in his , and then for the first time I realized that I was no longer in the navy , but only a very unhappy littleboy . But the Confederacy was calling me , and I marched firmly on . The call seemed much louder at Annapolis than it did after 1 reached my native land . Al that time I was very small for my age ( fifteen ) , so small , in fact , that I was dubbed ' Little ' NI organ , which nickname has stuck to me to this day despite my five feet nine and a quarter inches in height and over t.tvo hundred pounds weight . With h as much dignity as my size at the time would permit of my assuming , I took my seat in the car and started for Washington . Then I commenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars , all the pay that was due me when I resigned , and there was a thousand miles for me to travel to reach my home ; but what worried me most . was the fear that the authorities would arrest MC if they found out that I proposed to offer my services to the Southern Confederacy . I had no civilian togs , but . I had taken the gold anchors ow my collar , on which they had left dark imprints , and put blue velvet covers , fastened by elastics , over the brass buttons of my jacket . This , with the glazed cover of my cap to hide the silver anchor which adorned its front , constituted my disguise , which I felt sure would be sufficient to enable me to slip through the enemy 's capital without recognition . I was just , beginning to feel comfortable when a motherly-looking old lady on the opposite seat disturbed my equanimity by asking me in a loud voice if I was one of those little Naval Academy boys who were going South . ' ' That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . I had not an idea as to what . I would have to do to reach home after I ar-rived in Washington ; so , to throw the minions of Abraham IAncoln further my trail , I went straight to the house of Captain Henry Maynadier , U.S.A. , all ardent Union man who had 4 RECOLLECTIONS OF A REBEL REEFER married one of my first cousins . I told him that I wanted to get home and had no money , and then , washing my hands of all responsibility , left the rest for him to do . Ile did it . Ile obtained a permit for himself and me to pass through the lines , and , hiring a hack , we started on our adventure . The Union pickets held the Long Bridge ; half a mile below , on the Alexandria road , were posted the Confederate sentries . Of course , with the per- i t , we had no difficulty in crossing t he bridge ; but before we had proceeded very far on the road a man with a gun jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fellow was an Irishman who had formerly done chores at Captain Maynadier 's house in Washington , and , of course , he instantly recognized him , at the same time crying out gleefully , ' Begorra 1 we 'll whip those dirty nigger-loving Yanks now that you are coming with us ! ' The captain said a few pleasant words to him , told him that . I. was going South , and asked hint to see that I did not miss my way to Alexandria where I was to catch the train . IIe also told me to jump out quickly and ordered the driver to turn around . I had hardly reached the ground when the driver put whip to his horses and the astounded picket , recovering from his astonishment , raised his gun . I begged him not to shoot , assuring him that Captain Maynadier was coming South later . Ile clid ? with Sherman ! This occurred in the latter part of April . In November of that year , Captain Maynadier and I were shooting at each other at . Island No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Alexandria , 1 found a great crowd wildly cheering ex-Senator Vigra , who was a volunteer aide on General Beau-regard 's staff and who had received the sword of Major Anderson when Fort Sumter surrendered . Wigfall stood on the rear platform of a car , bowing his appreciation of the enthusiasm . I found an unoccupied seat on the train and was making myself comfortable , when a big , broad-shouldered , stumpy man waddled up to where I sat , and said , ' Sonny , as you are so small and I am so large , I think we will make a good fit for this narrow seat ' ; and , without further ado , he seated himself beside me , first asking me to move so he could have the place by the window . ' 1'lle train started amid wild cheers for Wigfall , the hero of the hour , and at every station where we stopped crowds were gathered , demanding a speech from the great man . The stout fellow with the short legs who was seated beside me apparently took no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts . It was some tinge after dark when we arrived at Lynchburg , Virginia , where the largest crowd we had yet seen was waiting for the train . Many of the men bore torches , but they were not cheering for Wigfall ; they seemed to be in an ugly humor about something . Suddenly there were cries of ' Hang the traitor ! Here is a rope ! Bring him out ! ' as the maddened mob fairly swirled about the car . A man burst through the door , rushed up the aisle to where I sat , and said to my neighbor , ' Are you Andy Johnson 1 ' ' I am Mr. Johnson , ' replied the stout gentleman . Well , ' said the stranger , ' I want to pull your nose ! ' and he made a grab for Mr. Johnson 's face . The latter brushed the man 's hand aside , at t110 same time jumping to his feet . There followed a scuffle for a few seconds , and poor little me , being between the combatants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they wanted to lynch Mr. Johnson was the fact that he was reported to be on his way to Tennessee for the purpose of preventing RECOLLECTIONS OE A REBEL REEFER hat state from seceding . Mr. Wigfall came up to - Mr . Johnson and asked him to go out on the platform with him . Vigrall at . once addressed t he mob and urged t hem to give Mr. Johnson it hearing , which they did . The latter commenced his speech by saying , I am a Finial man ! ' and he talked to them until the train moved off , holding their intention as though they were spellbound . his last words were , I am a Mon man ! ' ? and the last cry we heard from the crowd was , I Lang him ! ' On relating the foregoing incident , to M r , George A. Trenholm , then Secretary of the Confederate Treasury , I expressed the opinion that it was one of the greatest exhibitions of courage I had ever witnessed ; but Mr. Trenholm cast a damper on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Johnson since we were young men . He rode into prominence on the shoulders of just such a mob as you saw at Lynchburg , and no man knows how to handle such a crowd better than Mr , Johnson . I fad he weakened , they probably would have hung him . ' It was the same Andrew Johnson , afterwards President of the United States , who granted Mr. Trenhohn amnesty and a pardon in 1866 . II Continuing my journey , I at last arrived at Montgomery , Alabama , capital of the Confederate , States . My fears that the war would be over before I got there were somewhat allayed , for I had been told positively that . it would not last six weeks before the South finished it victoriously . I found the new capital in a ferment of excitement . Nobody seemed to know exactly what it was about , but it was the fashion to be excited . From every house containing a piano the soul-stirring strains of the Marseillaise floated out of open windows . At the hotel where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big parlor was crowded with men dressed in uniforms designed to the taste of the wearer , so that it looked like a gathering for a fancy-dress ball . On the chairs and window-sills were bottles of wine and glasses , while at the piano sat it burly German who , of course , crashed out the everlasting Marseillaise while his enthusiastic audience sang it . A more ridiculous sight than a lot of native-born Americans , not understanding a word of French , beating their breasts as they howled what t hey flattered themselves were the words of t he song , it was never before any bad fortune to witness . There was a moment 's halt in the music while some one made a war speech . The tired and sweating tier-man musician took advantage of t he respite to get a little air also , and , as he stood beside me , I heard him mutter , ' Dom the Marseillaise ! ' The morning alter my arrival , I went to the Capitol to offer my services , and the sword I intended to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees rushing about the building in a great state of excitement , but with nothing to do . None of them could tell me where I could find the Secretary of the Navy . At last . I ran across an intelligent official who informed me t hat . ' ' here war n't no such person . ' It appeared to be the custom of the attachwhen in doubt , to refer the stranger to Mr. Judah P. Benjamin , the Pooh Bah ' of the Confederate government , then Secretary of State . lie informed me that there was not as yet . any Confederate Navy , and further humiliated me by calling me ' sonny . ' I fowever , he was very kind and took me into 1 he private office of President . Jefferson Davis , who was kindness personified and told me to go home and tell my parents t hat , as soon as the government established 6 RECOLLEClIONS OF A REBEL REEFER a Naval School , I should have one of the first . appointments . I left the presence of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had conic to fight , not 1,0 go to school . I had just left the greatest naval school in the world ? and here the best , they could oiler ? me was a place in some makeshift , academy to be erected in the dim future ! I felt that I had been deceived and badly treated , and I mentally comforted myself with the assurance dna I knew more about drill and tact ics than the whole mob of civilian generals and colonels who thronged the Capitol 's corridors . But r . Davis did not know this . I was a full-blown pessimist by the time I reached my hotel , where I was greeted by the sounds of the everlasting Enfants de la Pattie , ' being hiccoughed as usual in the parlor ; and for the rest , of the day I iterated and reiterated the German 's prayer , ' 1 ) oin the Ma rseillaiser The only way to get from Montgomery to Mobile was by steamboat. ; and all the boats had been seized by the government . for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of die transports , as a favor , allowed not to pay for my passage to Mobile on condition that . I would sleep on the deck , if I could find a place , and supply my own provisions . The boat would start when he received orders , but he did not know when that would be . A two days ' wait followed , during which I stayed on the boat . so as to be sure that I. would not , be left and consequently lose the price of my passage . That was important , as my finances were running low . Confederate money had not yet made its appearance , and gold was even then being hoarded . I had already lost quite a sum exchanging one state 's money for another , as even the paper money issued in one county did not pass at par in the next ( if accepted at all ) ; but everybody was jubilant over the fact that the Confederate Congress had appropriated fifteen millions of dollars to carry the war on to a successful termination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volunteers took possession of the boat 111 ( 1 we were off . The transport . carried no guns , but she was armed with an instrument of torture called a calliope , ' or steam piano , and as she backed out into the river it broke loose , shrieking an imitation of the Marseillaise , which , with few intermissions , was kept up during the two days and nights it took us to reach Mobile . When the calliope did stop , it was very soothing to hear the negro deck-hands break into song with their tuneful melodies . The volunteers were composed of fresh youthful-looking men , and almost every one of them was accompanied by a ' body servant , ' as negro valets were called in the South , They were also accompanied by a great number of baskets of champagne and boxes of brandy . Few aristocrats in those days ever drank whiskey , which was supposed to be a vulgar tipple . They also had huge hampers containing roasted turkeys , chickens , hams , and all sorts of good things , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one to three trunks containing his necessary wardrobe . I saw some of these same young men in the muddy trenches in front of Richmond in 1865 , when they were clothed partially in rags , and were gnawing ears of hard corn , and would gladly have exchanged half a dozen negroes or a couple of hundred acres of land for a square meal or a decent bed to sleep on . HI My record of those crowded clays is so voluminous that I pass over the events of the next few months , which led to my definite appointment as midshipman in t he Confederate Navy . After having a hand in the desperate fighting at Island No. 10 in the Mississippi , ' I was transferred for a short time to the James River , near Richmond , for gunboat duty , and then sent , by doctor 's orders , to Charleston . With all my state pride , I must acknowledge that the article of chills and fever handed to me On the James River was superior to the brand on the lower Mississippi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my strength I hat . the doctor ordered me to show Illyetd f at the Navy Department and ask for orders to some other station . Commodore French Forrest was chief of the Bureau of Orders and Detail , and I real-Iv thought he had some sympathy for my condition when he looked me over . Ile asked me where I would like to be ordered to , and I quickly said that I should be delighted if I was sent to the naval battery at Port . Hudson . The ifinimalore then asked if I had relatives near there , and on my assuring him that my mother and sisters were refugees and were staying at the plantation of General Carter , only a few miles distant , he turned to a clerk and said , ' Make out an order for Midshipman Morgan to report to Commodore Ingraham at Charleston , South Carolina . I don't. believe in having young officers tied to their mothers ' apron-strings . ' Aad so to Charleston I went . Commodore Ingraham , to whom I reported , was the man who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sloop-of-war St. Louis , in the port of Smyrna , hail bluffed an Austrian frigate and compelled her to surrender Martin Kot 7 , a , a naturalized American citizen , whom they held as it prisoner . This act . made Ingraham the idol of t he people at . that time if repeated in t his day CUM ) , it would cost an officer his commission . Commodore I ogre ha in also commanded the Confedera e gunboats when t hey drove the Federal blockading fleet away from Charleston . I was assigned to the Chieora , a little ironclad that . Was being built between two wharves which served as a navy yard . She was not nearly completed , so I was forced to hunt for quarters on shore . Being directed to it miserable boa rd ing-house , which was fourth-rate , and consequently supposed to be cheap , I found that . the cheapest . board to be had was at the rate of forty-five dollars a month , so I did not see exact ly how I could manage it. , as my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel proprietor , when the situation was explained , consented to let me slay for that . sum , on condition that , I would make up the other live dollars if my friends at home sent me ; Lily money . The man was certainly taking a long chance . Where were my friends , : and where was my home ? My mother and sisters were refugees . As for my home , it wits a wreck . Lieutenant . Warley , with whom I had served on the McRae , was the only human being I knew in Charleston , and the great difference in our ranks , as well as our ages , precluded t he possibility of my making it companion of hint ; so , a lonely boy , I roamed the streets of the quaint old city . Evidently the war as yet had had no effect on the style 8 RECOLLECTIONS OP A REBEL REEFER kept up by the old blue-bloods , for I. was amazed to see handsome equipages , with coachmen in livery on the box , driving through the t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long those same line horses would be hauling artillery and commissary wagons , and those proud liveried servants would be at . work wit It pick and spade throwing up breast works ! To my great delight , George I EMI ins , a son of my dearly loved old Commodore , a boy of about my own age with whom I had been shipmate On the - Mississippi River , arrived in town , and I he boarding-house man consented to allow him to share my little room at the same rate charged me . George had been in Charleston only a few days when yellow fever became epidemic . It was the latter part of August and the heat was something fearful . I had no fear of the fever , as 1 had been accustomed to its frequent visits to my old home ; but with Hollins , a native of lEaltimore , it was different . One afternoon he came into our room and complained of a headache and a pain in his back . The symptoms were familiar to me , so I persuaded him to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blanket . I then went quickly downstairs and asked the wife of the proprietor to let . me have some hot water for it foot-bath , and also to give 11W it little mustard . The woman was shocked at my presumption , but consented to give inc the hot . water ; at . parting with the mustard she demurred . As I was about to leave her kitchen , she demanded to know what . I wanted with hot water , and when I told her that my friend had the yellow fever , there was a scene in which she accused me of trying to ruin the reputation of the house , and threatened me with dire punishment from her husband . I made Hollins put his feet . in the hot water and then I went tot ) . nearby drug gist , telling him the situation , and asking him if he would credit me for the mustard , explaining that neither Hollins nor myself had any money . The kindly apothecary gave me the mustard and told me I could have any medicines needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see poet or Lebby , who , he was sure , would at tend to the case without charge . The doctor came and did all that was possible . Poor George grew rapidly worse ; he seemed to cling to me as his only friend , and could not bear to have me leave him for an instant . We slept that night . huddled up together in the narrow bed . The next morning it strange negro man , very well dressed , and carrying a bunch of flowers in one hand and it bundle in t he other , entered the room and firoceeded tx ? nake himself very much at home . Mien asked what his business was , he said he was a yellow-fever nurse . I told him that we had no money and could not pay a nurse , at which he burst . into a broad grin and said that he did not ' Nil n t any money ; that he belonged to Mr. Tren holm , who had sent him there . Through the day all sorts of delicacies continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from , t he reply was , Arr . Trenholm . ' The second night of his illness , George was taken with h the black vomit. , which , as I held him in my arms , saturated my clothes . A shiver passed through his frame and without , a word he died . Leaving my friend 's body in charge of t he nurse , I went in search of Lieutenant Warley , who told me not . to worry about the funeral as Mr.Trenholm would make all arrangements . George Hollins wits buried in the beautiful Magnolia Cemetery , and immediately after the funeral , Mr. Warley told me that . I was not to go back to the boarding-house , but was for the present to share his room at the Mills House , a fashionable hotel . // Iv A few days after the funeral , as I was walking down Broad Street with Mr. Warley , we saw coining toward us a tall and very handsome man with silvery hair . Mr. Warley told me that he was Mr. Trenholm , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my rrictill . I r . Trenholm said t hat . he was only sorry that he could not have done more for the poor boy , and , turning to the lieutenant , said , Warley , ca n't you let this young gentleman come and stay at my house ? There arc some young people there , and we will try to make it pleasant for him . ' I thanked Mr. Trenholm , and told him that I had recently been sleeping the same bed with , my friend , who had died of the most virulent . form of yellow fever , and of course I could not go into anybody 's house for some time to come ; but the generous gentleman assured me that his family had tto fears of the fever and insisted on my accepting his kind invitation . However , 1 did not . think it right to go , and did not accept at that time ; but a day or two afterwards , I again met him , with Mr. Warley , and he said , Warley , I sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would try to make it pleasant for him . ' Mr. Warley turned to me , saying , ' Youngster , you pack your bag and go up to Mr. Trenholm 's house . ' That settled it and I went. , arriving at the great mansion shortly before the dinner-hour . I did not. , however , take a bag with me . If I had owned one , I should have had nothing to put in it . I will not attempt to describe Mr. Trenholm 's beautiful home . For more than half a century now it has been pointed out to tourists as one of the show places of Charleston , and has long since passed into the hands of strangers . I must confess that , as I opened the iron gate and walked through the well-kept grounds to the front . door , I was a little awed by the imposing building , with its great . columns supporting the portico . I could not but feel some misgivings as to the reception I would get , stranger as I was , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not dare run away , and so I timidly rang the bell . A slave , much better dressed than I , and with the manners of it Chesterfield , appeared and showed me into the parlor ; it , 111was very grand , but very lonely , as there was no one there to receive me . I took a seat and made myself comfortable ; it had been it long time since I had sal on it luxurious sofa . In a few minutes , two young ladies entered . Of course . I had never seen either of them before , but the idea instantly flashed into my mind that L was going to marry the taller of the two , who N11110 toward me and introduced herself as Miss Trenhohn . While we were chatting , there arrived it Frenchman , a Colonel i.e Atat , the inventor of the ' grapeshot revolver , ' a horrible contraption , t he cylinder of which revolved around a section of a gun-barrel . The cylinder con t ttined ten bullets , and the grapeshot barrel was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost tear the ; ? m oft ' a man with its recoil . Le Mat 's English vocabulary was limited , and his only subject of conversation was his invention , so he used me to explain to the young ladies how the infernal machine worked . Now that sounds all very easy , but one must remember that . Le INIat was a highly imaginative Gaul and insisted on posing me to illustrate his lecture . This was embarrassing , especially as he considered it polite to commence over again as each new guest entered the room . At last relief 1a1110 when M r . Trenholin arrived with a beautiful lady , well past middle-age , leaning on his arm ; and I was intro 10 RECOLLECTIONS OF A REBEL REEFER ( lured to my hostess , whose kind face and gent le manner put me at my ease at once .

I ) inner over , we assembled in the drawing-room , where we were enjoying music , when suddenly I found myself in a most embarrassing position . Dear , kind IVIrs. l'renholm was the cause of it . Despite my protestations that naval officers were neverallowed to open their uniform coats , she insisted , as it was so warm , that . I should unbutton mine out be comfortable . Unbutton that coat ! Never ! I would have died first . I had no shirt under that . coat : I did not . own one . When bedtime arrived Mr. Trenholm escorted me to a handsomely furnished room . What a sleep I had that night . between those snow-white sheets , and what a surprise there was in the morning when I opened my eyes and saw a man-servant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On a chair there lay a newly pressed suit of civilian togs . I assured the man that he had made a mistake , but he told me that he had orders from his mistress , and that all those things and the contents of a trunk he had brought . into the room were forme , adding that they had belonged to his young ' Mars ' Alfred , ' a boy of about my own age , whose health had broken down in the army and who had been sent abroad . I wanted the servant to leave the room so that I could rise . I was too modest to get out of bed in his presence and too diffident to ask him to leave ; but at last I reflected that everybody must know that I had no shirt. , so I jumped up and tumbled into a bath , and when the body ' servant . had arrayed me in those fine clothes I hardly knew myself . After breakfast two horses were brought to the front of the house ? one , with a lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most . beautiful Arabs I ever saw ( and I have seen many ) ; the other , a grand chestnut , called Jonce Hooper , W110 was one of the most fatuous racehorses on the Southern turf when the war began . He had been bought . by Colonel William Trenholm , my host 's eldest . son , for a charger ; but Colonel Trenhohn soon found that the pampered racer was too delicate for rough field-work in time of war . Miss Troll holm and I mounted these superb animals , and that morning and many mornings afterwards , we went for long rides . In the afternoons I would accompany the young ladies in a landau drawn by a fine pair of bays , with two men on the box . Just , at that time the life of a Confederate midshipman did not seem to me to be one of great hardship ; but my life of ease and luxury was fast drawing to an end .

Suddenly , Mr. Trenhohn came over to where I was laughing and talking with a group of young people , and asked me if I would like to go abroad and join a cruiser . I told him that nothing would delight me more , but that those details were for officers who had distinguished themselves , or who had influence , and that as I had not RECOLLECTIONS OF A REBEL REEFER l done the one thing , and did not possess the other requisite , I could stand no possible chance of being ordered to go . : Ir . ' Frenholm said that was not , the question : he wanted to know if I really wished to go . On being assured that I would give anything for the chance , he returned to Commodore Maury and resumed his conversation about t he peculiarities of the Gulf Stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning from riding , I was handed a telegram which read : Report . to Commodore M. F. Maury for duty abroad . Mr. Trenhohn will arrange for your passage . Signed : S. R. Mallory . Secretary of the Navy . ' It fairly took my breath away ! Mr. Trenholm owned many blockade-runners ? one of them , the lit t le light-draught steamer Herald , was lying in Charleston harbor loaded with cotton and all ready to make an a it empt , to run through the blockading fleet . Commodore Maury , accompanied by his little son , a boy twelve years of age , and myself , whom he had designated as his aide-de-camp for the voyage , went on board after bidding goodbye to our kind friends . About ten o'clock at night , we got under way and steamed slowly down the harbor , headed for the sea . The moon was about half-full , but heavy clouds coming in from the ocean obscured it . We passed between the great lowering forts of Moultrie and Sumter , and were soon on the bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through which the moon shone brightly , and there , right ahead of us we plainly saw a big sloopof-war ! There was no use trying to hide . She had also seen us , and the order Harda-starboard ! ' which rang out on our boat was nearly drowned by the roar of the warship 's great guns . The friendly clouds closed again and obscured the moon , and we rushed back to the pmtect Mg guns of t he forts wit hou t having had our paint scratched . Two or three more days were passed delight fully in Charleston ; then there came a drizzly min and on t he night of t he 11th or October , 1862 , we made another attempt to get through the blockade . All lights were out except . t he one in t he covered binnacle , protecting the compass . Not . ad word was spoken save by the pilot , who gave his orders to t he man at t he wired in whispers . Captain Cowl ter , who commanded t he I lerald , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no desire to be taken prisoner , as he had been proclaimed by t he Federal government to be a pirate and was doubtful about I he 1 rya tment he would receive if he fell into t he enemy 's hands . I 11 MIS convinced t hat the great danger in running t he blockade was in his own engine-room , so he seated himself on the ladder leading down to it and politely informed theengineer that if the engine stopped before he was clear of the fleet , he , the engineer , would be a dead man . As ( ' oxet ter held in his hand a Colt 's revolver , t his sounded like no idle threat .. Presently I heard the whispered word passed along the deck that we were on t he bar . This information was immediately followed by a series of bumps as the little ship rose on t he seas , which were quite high , and then plunging downward , hit , the bottom , causing her to ring like an old tin pan . however , we safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossing in the gale , this little : cockle-shell , whose rail was scarcely five feet above t he sea-level , bucked her way toward Bermuda . She was about as much under water as she was on top of it for most of the voyage .
