OUT of the hurlyburly of material progress and the general destruction of things beautiful there has arisen a colossal sanctuary of wild nature . Four years ago the birth of Glacier National Park created little more than a ripple ; but generations yet unborn will some day celebrate that event . Of all scenic assets of the American people this stupendous park is the greatest , and , like the Grand Canyon of the Colorado , it is in a class by itself . Of the really great scenic resources of this nation , Glacier Park is conspicuously the one that is newest , least known , and least appreciated . In size , beauty , grandeur , and scientific interest it literally staggers the imagination . Fortunately it contains no valuable minerals , no cornfields , no grazing grounds for sheep or cattle , and no valuable water power . On the auction block it would be worth the price of its standing timber , and nothing more . As a scenic wonderland , and a summer playground for forty generations of Americans , it is worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about as well known as Kiateuer Falls , and no more . That is the fault of the advertising men ; but the real loss falls on the public . The remarkable thing about Glacier Park is the unbelievable manner in which so many great features have been brought together by the prod- igal hand of Nature , and set down in that one mountain fastness . It is a bewildering maze of thundering peaks , plunging valleys , mirror lakes , thrilling glaciers , roaring streams , and evergreen forests . Its leading citizens are white mountain goats , mountain sheep , moose , mule deer , and white-tailed deer , and also among those present are black and grizzly bears enough for all visitors . Set down in cold figures , the map area of the park is 1,400 square miles ; but measured as the goat climbs , up and down , its area is at least double that . There are 6o glaciers , and 26o lakes . There are rivers a-plenty ; but their mileage is unknown to man . A SCENIC WONDERLAND The time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two St. Mary Lakes were , either together or separately , a mountain-goat hunter 's paradise ; but the awful mountains beyond them , southwestward , were rarely penetrated . Today there is a good automobile road from Glacier Park Station , on the railway , up to the camp at the foot of Upper St. Mary Lake , 36 miles , and the trip is made by automobile in a little less than three hours . But there is an easier , cheaper , and more beautiful line of approach , by which the heart of Glacier Park is rendered almost absurdly accessible . It is by way of Lake McDonald . Its only fault lies in the fact that through lack of hard labor the visitor may fail to take his blessings at their par value . Your train lands you at Belton , and instantly disappears into the mountains . A ride of three miles over a fine road , through a grand forest , brings you to the foot of lovely Lake McDonald , the key to a large situation . High and rugged peaks encompass the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies beyond . Later on you discover by your own efforts that the answer is Avalanche Basin ,  | three ropelike waterfalls dangling down a lofty mountainside , another lovely lake , and an uncertain number of trout . For the first movement , however , you take ship , and after one hour of fascinating navigation you are landed at the Glacier Hotel , close to those encircling mountains . A log cabin in the shelter of the forest , within striking distance of the hotel , is all sufficient . INTO THE PARK And how does one penetrate to the heart of Glacier Park ? The answer is absurdly easy ; but there are those who prefer the automobile line to Upper St. Mary , because it is easier for the ladies at the beginning . At the Glacier Hotel , guides , saddle-horses , and pack-horses can be obtained that will suit the taste of the most fastidious . Your guide will look after everything save your own personal belongings , and coach you besides in the love of the mountain land . The first day 's journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly on end . " As soon after breakfast as you can orient yourself , you and your guide mount and ride into the forest primeval . In thirty minutes the grandeur of the great Douglas and Engelmann spruces , the firs , hemlocks , white pines , and cedars , grips you , and you realize that you have entered a different world . As the trail winds to and fro while you carom on the  | huge brown trunks , you volley questions at the helpless guide regarding this and that shrub and tree . Your blaseness drops off , and you surrender to the Place and Hour . You recall certain theories that you have read and heard about lumbering in national parks , " cutting out the ripe timber , " et cetera . What ! cut out these " ripe trees , " with merciless ax and saw , and drag these giant trunks through this lovely undergrowth , with endless smash and crash ? Never ! Perish the thought ! From ax and saw and fire may Heaven defend these forests forever ! After three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away down below the Sperry Glacier , and look about for ice . But the guide says indifferently , " Well , I think we 'll go up to Lincoln Peak this afternoon , and try the glacier tomorrow . " This is disappointing , very ; but a good tourist usually humors the whims of his guide . After a mighty luncheon you mount once more , and slowly ride up the side of a great easterly ridge . At last you reach a lofty saddle , beyond which even a mountain horse can not climb . From that point half an hour of hard scrambling lands you breathless and panting on the apex of Lincoln Peak , and then Glacier Park bursts upon you with one resounding crash . It would require pages to describe the magnificent array of peaks and precipices , canyons and cliffs , lakes , streams , and waterfalls that are surveyed in one eye-sweep from the top of that dinky little peak . Lake Ellen Wilson lies miles below , ? so it seems , ? an emerald set in solid rock , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drops 1,200 feet we  | gasped . Far off to the northeast rose Gunsight Peak and Gunsight Pass , leading direct to the Blackfeet Glacier and St. Mary 's two lakes . Nov here is the feature of my story that no reader will believe without an affidavit : When the guide rolled a stone over the precipice at our feet ( facing eastward ) to demonstrate the Boo feet height and depth of it , the fall of the dornick dislodged a living , palpitating white mountain goat . A shaggy old " Billy " of large size went bounding away down the rocky mountainside as if the Old Nick was after him ! I was delighted , because my Boston comrade greatly wished to see a live white goat in its own natural haunts ; which , having been accomplished , he spread his long legs , lifted his arms on high , and shouted to ye crags and peaks : " Thank God that I 'm alive ! " A BIRDSEYE VIEW In Glacier Park there is , so I believe , more geography to the square mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this round earth . Perhaps that is one of the " reasons " of the park . Let us take a birdseye view of it . You find Glacier Park on and in and underneath the Rocky Mountains where they culminate in the great continental divide and fetch up against the international boundary . Of course this means northwestern Montana . With the craziest windings and meanderings imaginable , the  | summit line of the divide fairly bisects the park , and the general trend of the wonderland is from northwest toward the southeast . The Flathead River forms the entire southwestern boundary of the park , 72 miles if measured in a straight line , but much more actually . On a map the rivers and creeks that run down to this stream from the continental divide look exactly like the teeth of a comb . There are 20 of them of first-order rank , and smaller ones innumerable . Along the southeastern ? and the shortest ? boundary of the park runs the Great Northern Railway , chasing along the Flathead River and Bear Creek for 25 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been at Midvale , io miles farther on ; for it is there that the plains resign and the rugged Rockies take entire charge of the situation . The northeastern boundary follows no natural feature ; but in the most reckless fashion cuts across creeks and rivers , dodges in between the St. Nlary Lakes , slides over the western foot of Sherburn Peak , climbs squarely over the top of Chief Mountain , and after a final dash due northward comes up against the Canadian boundary with a bang , and stops . On its wild way northward it separates the Blackfeet Indian Reservation from the park . The international boundary base cuts squarely across Waterton Lake  | amidships , and a huge drainage basin pours a lot of first-class American water into the lap of southern Alberta . Naturally the glaciers , like the mountain goats , inhabit the highest valleys of the continental backbone , and the largest ones are strung on the summit line , like beads on a string . It is thus that you will find , starting in the south , the Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Grinnell , Chaney , Carter , and several others of smaller size . The great central region , from the Blackfeet Glacier up to Grinnell Mountain , is a bewildering , stupendous labyrinth of peaks , glaciers , lakes , and passes , and it is only the finest of the photographs , reproduced on a large scale , that yield even a faint conception of its grandeur and its wonders . Owing to the influence of the continental watershed , nearly all the rivers of Glacier Park run from northeast to southwest , or the reverse , and the lakes do likewise . The fashionable shape for a Glacier Park lake is very long and narrow , and pointed at one end , like the war club of a Matabele ( mah-tah-bay ' - lee ) warrior . THE LAKES Take them all in all , coming or going , I think that after everything has been seen and said the lakes furnish the greatest charm of Glacier Park . The mountains and peaks are the monuments of the ages , the glaciers are the natural curiosities , the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jewels that have been set by the hand of God Himself . Show me the man who is insensible to their charms , and I will show you a Hopeless Case . Seen close at hand , the big ones , like McDonald , are deeply , darkly , beautifully blue , bordered by limpid green . Seen from aloft , the small lakes , Gunsight and Ellen Wilson , embosomed in the high ranges , are like polished emeralds , clear , green , and surpassingly lovely . A lake like Ellen Wilson , as seen from Lincoln Peak on a still and clear afternoon , is enough to make a lump rise in the throat of a marble Buddha . There are a few  | things in scenery that can not be described , and to my mind a high mountain lakelet is one . The clearness of the water along the rocky shores appeals to me . In the Corcoran Art Gallery you can find this charming feature beautifully depicted in Bierstadt 's painting of l'VIount Corcoran . In the best phctographs of the upper end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore is beautifully shown ; but in black and white it lacks the exquisite emerald green of the real thing . The lakes of Glacier Park reveal two distinct types . The first is the large , deep , sea-going lake , like McDonald , from 25o to 300 feet deep , occupying a large basin , and affording much entertainment . The other is the jewel type , like Lakes Ellen Wilson , and Gunsight , too small to navigate and too large to be carried away and mounted in gold , as jewelry . The finest trip in Glacier Park is from Lake McDonald to the permanent camp at the foot of Upper St. Mary ; and in the course of that 42 mile journey of oh 's and ah 's you see the best of both the lake types that I have feebly attempted to describe . That trip is only 42 miles as the crow could fly if he would , from Belton on the railroad . It takes you entirely across the solar plexus of Glacier Park , and discloses the best line of scenic wonders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow into the Pacific , while the waters of Gunsight and St. Mary seek the Atlantic . THE GLACIERS The glaciers of Glacier Park are numerous , widely distributed , and sufficient ; but they are not stupendous , like some of those of that awful area in the Canadian Rockies encompassed by the waters of the Athabasca , Saskatchewan , and Bush Rivers . Those are to be taken as an Englishman  | writes a book about a pleasure trip , ? very seriously . For modest tourists like myself , however , the Sperry Glacier and the Blackfeet do very nicely . Of course no one needs to be told that these park glaciers are of the common garden variety ( i. e. , hanging garden ) , and do not imitate the awful sea-going breeders of icebergs that grow in Alaska , and break away at salt water . The average photographer of scenery fails in glacier pictures in Glacier Park . The best glacier pictures that I have seen were taken by a sportsman . He has done justice to the Sperry crevasses , which lie away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glacier is so near to Lake McDonald that a child of sixteen can attain it ; but the fat man or the timid lady surely needs a rope to give confidence up a certain thirty feet of rock wall that can not be ignored . The Sperry is not by any means a big glacier ; but it is big enough to have given thrills to a great many appreciative tourists out for their first offense . On a drizzling day it seems horribly cold and wet , and the crevasses make you shiver as you imagine falling into one of twenty or thirty feet , head downward ? as a man of whom I read once did , to his sorrow . Yes , he was pulled out ; and , being tough as a wolf , he survived . I know of no one spot in the new wonderland park where the tourist can get so much for so little as in the Sperry Glacier region . On that . short jaunt from Lake McDonald you can get a mighty good series of samples of Glacier Park . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the view of Gunsight region , Lake Ellen Wilson , the glacier itself , and Ava- lanche Basin , into ? the glacier 's water f You can climb down rectly from the gla to Avalanche B but it is a dange and difficult task , good guides advi against it . It is to take horses at Glacier Hotel and to the basin ; but on dripping day you wa all the waterproo there are in the w world . Avalanche Basin a type of many such , = a lovely green lake at the foot of tremendous cliffs , down which three white ropes of water dangle over 3,000 feet more or less ) of naked rocks from the foot of the glacier . Beautiful evergreen forest clothes the scanty lake margin almost to the water 's edge . There are trout in the lake ? plenty of them , fair in size and good fishing . WONDERS OF THE PARK We could in time tell you the elevation , length , breadth , and thickness of each important scenic feature in the park ; but why impose on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most beautiful works , figures jar us all . The best descriptions are those handed out by the camera . Mere words of mine can not add a mite to the speaking beauties of these marvelously clear mountain air photographs of the choicest scenic effects of the American wonderland . In the presence of a superb photo- graph wordy explanations can be an offense . These pictures are more eloquently expressive than any text could be . Each year the wonders and beauties of the great northwestern playground are becoming more accessible . The camps and trails that have been made and laid are very much to our mind . They are absolutely necessary . In 5o years or so some substantial progress may be made in familiarizing the public mind with the beauties of Glacier Park ; but even that is open to doubt . This makes me fretful ; for I know how great a mental struggle is required , everywhere east of the Keokuk dam , to get a half-hitch on an idea of scenery z , 000 miles away , and make a fast turn round a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is why 90 per cent . of the visitors registered at the hotels on Lake INIcDonald hail from westward of St. Paul , and eastern folk are literally not in it ? or at least not much .  |
