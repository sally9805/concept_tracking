Bassett 's " Life of Andrew Jackson , " published in two volumes in 1911 by Doubleday , Page &; Co. , has been taken over by the Macmillan Co. which has brought out an attractive edition in one volume ( $2.50 ) from the same plates . The principal change in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his interview with Jackson , in November , 1829 , about the Bank of the United States . The portrait of Jackson by D. M. Carter , which in the original edition faced page 476 of Volume II , has been omitted ; and the two likenesses of 1845 have , curiously enough , been transposed , but without transposition of the accompanying legends . An interesting subject and an excellent style combine to make Mr. Farnham Bishop 's " The Story of the Submarine " ( Century Co. ; $1 net ) an unusually readable little book . After summarizing the early attempts at underwater navigation and warfare as related by the standard authorities , Barber , Fyfe , Burgoyne , and others , he describes the growth and development of the modern submarine as well as its achievements in the present war . Written for the layman , and possibly for the youth in particular , the work avoids technical details while giving a good general idea , of the submarine 's mechanism and functions . The chapter treating of the supposed methods by which it is trapped or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the plans are on an inconveniently small scale ; otherwise the book is of admirable quality . As Mr. Bishop indulged in one flight of the imagination in spinning the yarn of a supposititious trip in " X-4 , " it seems a pity that he did not take another such flight and forecast , according to his judgment , the future of this new and disturbing factor in naval warfare . " Adventures of a Despatch Rider , " by Capt . W. H. L Watson ( Dodd , Mead ; $1.25 ) , is a record of one man 's experiences in the war from August , 1914 , to February , 1915 , based largely on letters written home during that period . Enlisting at the outbreak of the war as a motorcycle dispatch carrier , the author was with the British expeditionary force in its advance to Belgium , at the battles of Mons and Le Cateau , during the great retreat , and at the battles of the Marne and the Aisne . Then he was transferred to the north , and was present at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to break through to the Channel . The chief impression left by the book is of the utter confusion in the mind of the individual soldier as to what is going on , and of his feel-mg of helpless insignificance . " I started , " says the writer , " with an immense interest in tactics . This has nearly all left me , and I remain a more or less efficient dispatch-carrying animal  --  a part of a machine , realizing the hopeless enormous size of the machine . . . We are all either animals or machines , with little gained except our emotions dulled and brutalized and nightmare flashes of scenes that can not be written about because they are unbelievable . I wonder what difference you will find in us when we come home . " This is the testimony of one who , through his work , had exceptional opportunities to observe the positions of the army . No one participant , writing at the time , can have realized the epic sweep of the great battles and retreats ; the chief source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrative of minor incidents . Capt . Watson is a keen observer , and his story contains many effective bits of anecdote and description . He writes colloquially , at times rather slangily , with some odd solecisms , such as " I was woken up . " His comment on the village of Hinges will at once illustrate his style and suggest some possible linguistic results of the war . When first the corps came to Hinges , the inhabitants were exalted . The small boys came out in puttees , and the women put ribbons in their hair . Now , if you pronounce Hinges in the French fashion , you give forth an exclamation of distressful pain . The name can not be shouted from a motorcycle . So we all called it , plainly and bluntly , Hinges , as if it were connected to a door . The inhabitants noticed this . Thinking that they and their forefathers had been wrong  --  for surely these fine men with red hats knew - better than they  --  the English pronunciation spread The village became ' Ingees , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old pronunciation . The book contains some excellent maps . " Elementary Civics " ( Thompson , Brown &; Co. ) is the title of a small textbook compiled by Dr. Charles McCarthy , Flora ? wan , and Jennie McMullin for use by pupils in the upper grades of American grammar schools . Whether there is any proper place for this subject in the grammar-school programme of studies is extremely doubtful , and this little book will at least serve to strengthen honest doubts in that direction . It has evidently been compiled upon the theory that since boys and girls of grammar-school age can not be expected to understand the complications of government as it actually is , they should be pumped full of platitudes as to what government ought to be . Here is a typical example of what that doctrine leads to : It is very easy for us to look around and criticise the mismanagement of our cities . The really valuable thing is to make helpful suggestions and help to carry them out . Imagine yourself employed by your city as planning expert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. ( p. 73 ) . True enough , the youngster who reads this book will not be altogether wasting his time . He will learn a little about a great many things , from the life of the cave-dwellers to old-age pensions in New Zealand , or scientific forestry in Prussia , or the segregated budget of New York city . He will get even more from the pictures with which the book is well supplied , and which are for the most part well chosen and instructive . But he will not get from it any material appreciation of what our real political problems are , or have been , or are likely to be . The book is so intent upon dragging into its pages everything picturesque or striking that it omits most of the things which are fundamentally important . The first reflection likely to occur to the reader of Miss Florence M. Smith 's " Mary Astell " ( Columbia University Press ) is to ask why a woman so deeply interested in the education of women , and working under the direction of a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith 's style is not only unidiomatic , but is disfigured by Americanisms and even downright bad grammar . However , one has grown accustomed to expect anything but good English from doctoral theses , and the present study should not he censured too severely because it is not an exception . In the matter of knowledge Miss Smith 's work is well up to the average . She has read thoroughly the literature about her subject , and , despite a certain amount of repetition , has made a valuable contribution to the history of woman 's rights Though in no sense an advanced woman in the political sense of the modern suffragette , Mary Astell was strongly convinced of the intellectual equality of her sex , and fought consistently for equal opportunities of education Miss Smith , of course , accepts this thesis of intellectual equality as self-evident . Her work would have had more philosophical value if she had seen fit to examine historically and psychologically the truth of this assumption . Prof. Chauncey S. Boucher 's " Nullification Controversy in South Carolina " ( University of Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " Critical Study of Nullification in South Carolina , " published in 1896 . Professor Boucher has had the advantage of the Jackson , Van Buren , and Hammond papers in the Library of Congress , of the Poinsett papers in the Pennsylvania Library Society , and of a manuscript memoir of Grayson , none of which was accessible to Mr. ( now Secretary ) Houston twenty years ago ; and he has also made use of several extensive collections of pamphlets and of some twenty South Carolina newspapers . These primary sources have enabled him to trace in detail the course of political discussion and the development of public opinion in South Carolina during the Nullification period , and to show , more fully than Mr. Houston was able to do , the parts played by Jackson and other leading actors In these respects the volume is a real addition to knowledge of the subject . The main course of the Nullification controversy , however , remains as Mr. Houston out ; lined it . One misses , in . Professor Boucher 's work , a certain broad view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the important question of the economic conditions which underlay the Nullification movement is only lightly touched . Notwithstanding all that has been written on . the subject , the fundamental difference of view , not merely in regard to the relation of a State to the Union , but also in regard to the essential nature of government itself , which characterized the South in the ante-bellum period , and of which the contemporary newspaper and pamphlet literature holds the invaluable record , still awaits its expositor . We note the inclusion in the bibliography of a number of books , like McCrady 's histories of South Carolina in the Colonial and Revolutionary period , which have only remote bearing upon the events dealt with by Professor Boucher ; and " South Carolina College " is now , of course , the University of South Carolina . " For over twenty years I have found that I leave my library with regret , however long the day has been , and return to it always with delight " These words were written by Mr. John Cotton Dana , librarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any man who can thus write of his chosen calling after the lapse of twenty years is to be congratulated Such enthusiasm will carry him far . Mr. Dana has long been a prominent figure in the world of libraries , for he is a librarian with ideas , the courage to try new methods , and , best of all , he is entirely in sympathy with his public  --  a public to which he hopes to be more helpful day by day . He is a progressive of the best type The problem which he has met , and brought as near solution as any man in the profession , is that of making the public library a thing of real service to the commonalty . He has the vision to see and the ability properly to value the changing conditions among men ; and he endeavors always to have the institution of which he is the guiding spirit meet the needs of to-day with a thought for the probable needs of to-morrow . Nor is Mr. Dana a silent librarian . He has frequently delivered addresses and ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in librarianship , and others , will welcome the appearance of a selection of twenty-seven of these contributions in a volume entitled " Libraries : Addresses and Essays " ( H W. Wilson Co. ; $1.80 ) . A few of the subjects treated are : " The Public and Its Public Library , " " The Failure of Book Reviewing , " " Library Problems , " " What the People Read , " " Making a Library Known , " and " The Country Church and the Library . " One does not need to agree wholly with Mr. Dana to find his chapters both stimulating and interesting . The treatment is very frank and to the point , and the style is never dull . In fact , Mr. Dana at times writes so well that we regret to find that he uses the colloquialism " posted " when he means " informed , " and is even guilty of " I guess " for " I think . " In his essay on " The Failure of Book Reviewing , " he complains that reviews seldom enlighten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In this respect , the present reviewer will prove an exception to the rule by saying that Mr. Dana 's volume is outwardly not what it should be . It is too heavy and in appearance is too much like a textbook on mechanical or electrical engineering Although well printed and subsantially bound , it is not a bookish-looking book  --  as every collection of essays and addresses ought to be . The origin of the flora of the coast of Belgium is the subject of the opening article of the AnizaZes de Ci , dograplize for September , by J. Massart , professor of botany in the University of Brussels . His conclusion is that far more comes from the south than from the north . The methods by which a large tract of marsh land on the west coast of France has been transformed into a cultivated region contributing largely to the agricultural wealth of the country are described by Prof. J. Welsch , of , the University of Poitiers . The conditions , natural , social , and economic , which govern the pastoral life of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. Dedijer , of the University of Belgrade . He recalls the fact that between two and three centuries ago the villagers of Bosnia and Herzegovina were compelled to adopt the Mohammedan religion . But in the summer , when with their herds they went to their mountain pastures , they renounced it for their ancestral religion . " They lived thus for thirty years Christians in summer and Mohammedans in winter . " In his " Instincts of the Herd in Peace and War " ( Macmillan ; $1 25 ) Mr. W. Trotter has worked over two essays previously printed in the Sociological Review  --  has , in fact , written a book around them . He points out that he has " been engaged in trying to apply to the affairs of to-day principles which had taken shape ten years ago . I point this out not in order to claim any gift of foresight in having suggested so long ago reasons for regarding the stability of civilization as unsuspectedly slight , but because it is notorious that the atmosphere of a great war is unfavourable to free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human gregariousness and the instincts that go with it . It is about as convincing as such psychological constructions usually are . Towards the end of his volume the author comes to the consideration of " gregarious species at war , " and , selecting , as the two contrasting protagonists in the present struggle , England and Germany , attempts to picture the " mind " of each in accordance with the contentions which he thinks he has established in the foregoing . Germany is of the type of aggressive gregariousness and , like a dog , must be corrected in a manner which she will understand , namely , by a " thorough and drastic beating . " " The animal must be left in no doubt as to who is the master , and his punishment must not be diluted by hesitation , nervousness , or compunction on the part of the punisher . " " Germany has shown unmistakably the wayto her heart ; it is for Europe to take it . " As for the other protagonist , " the sole basis of a satisfactory morale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England is a true national unity , which is therefore the singular and complete remedy for all the civil difficulties incident upon a great and dangerous war . " The present disaster shows that the development of European civilization has been " radically unsound , " this being the result " of human progress being left to chance , and to the interaction of the heterogeneous influences which necessarily arise within a gregarious unit whose individual members have a large power of varied reaction . " Well , now that we see what is the matter , there will be no excuse for letting it happen again . A second edition of L T Hobhouse 's " Mind in Evolution " ( Macmillan ; $3.25 ) , takes account of the results of advance made in comparative psychology since the original publication of the book . Dr. Hobhouse has come to believe that mind has had an even more extended function in evolution than he had supposed . He thinks that the revolution in biological theory will be found , " as time goes on , to have invested the constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new importance , and in this constitution the fundamental fact everywhere is that the living being is not passive but active , not mechanical in its reaction to things , but assertive , plastic , and , in a measure proportioned to its development , self-determining If this is so , psychology will in the future have a larger part to play than has hitherto been supposed in the study of the rise and decay of forms of life " Concerning the general merits of this well-known book nothing needs to be said Its original thesis is strengthened and its original accumulation of evidence extended A novel and interesting deviation from the ordinary form of the Yale Lectures on Preaching is made by President William De Witt Hyde , of Bowdoin College . in " The Gospel of Good Will as Revealed in Contemporary Scriptures " ( Macmillan ; $1.50 net ) Dr. Hyde takes his text , as the title indicates , from incidents mentioned in well-known recent writings , thus he begins his first chapter , which is on Christ 's Expectation of Men , with a lesson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which he quotes at length , and in the same manner he treats his other topics , religious and economic . The central thought of the Lectures is the power of intelligent sympathy . Various burning questions of the present day are discussed , all with President Hyde 's accustomed frankness and vigor , and the volume appeals not only to preachers , but to all persons who are interested in the moral well-being of society . His theology is broad enough to welcome all whose desire is to live aright . " Christianity , " says he , " is the good news that no sin is too heinous to be forgiven provided the one who has committed it repents . " The proper spirit for international relations he illustrates by a quotation from Prof. F. W. FOrster , of the University of Munich , who in an address to the youth of Germany on the present war says : " Fill yourselves with deepest sympathy for all who suffer in war . . In the union of races will the universal Christ be born in us " By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is by no means dead in our midst . .
