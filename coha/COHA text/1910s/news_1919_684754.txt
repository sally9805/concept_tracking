txt What is the Social Unit experiment of which we are beginning to hear so much ? Bulletin No. 6. issued at the organization headquarters in Cincinnati . enables us to understand it . One picture is of last year 's children 's parade . To the detached view this may seem to have been a very dull affair . It consisted of some 3,000 youngsters of the Mohawk-Brighton district in which the experiment was tried  --  children of wage earners , mainly . Four little marshals led it , each on a Shetland pony . The Superintendent of Schools followed in an automobile which was brimming over with toddlers whose fathers were fighting in France . A parochial school marched under the leadership of the pastor . Eighty automobiles , contributed by the wealthier citizens - of Cincinnati , carried the children who were too young to march . Only one feature was really sensational  --  a cage filled with pelicans . contributed by the Zoo . The folk of the district , lining the curb . shouted and roared with emotion while tears filled their eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will kindle In sympathy . In a land of many and colorless homes , one district has been enabled to know itself through all its varied life , to feel all the warm bonds of human sympathy and to know the inspiration of mutual aid . These three thousand children were the emblems of the new day . There had been a census of them : they had been weighed and thoroughly examined to find- which needed treatment , and the treatment had been supplied . In the process mothers had come to know one another , to . sympathize with one another , to delight in social intercourse on the only true basis of a common work to do . The local lawyers , doctors , ministers . teachers , and trained nurses had ceased to be isolated " professional " people and had become a part of the big social family , intimately known and steadily helpful . When the epidemic of influenza came , the Social Unit met it in the first attack ; . the death rate was 2.0 per thousand , as against 5.2 per thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a theory which is not . as a theory , verY convincing . In our elder democracy of the smaller community , all me : : were known to all , and mutually selfhelpful . Today democracy has ceased to function as a result of the crowding of the modern city and the multiplicity of modern life . It must be made to function  --  and the Social Unit experimenters  --  say that it can be , if only the right people will set out to organize the work and are willing to spend some $7,000 to $17.000 on each district of from 15,000 to 30,000 People . The results of this social self-help are not always as sure as those obtained by organized charity and the visiting worker . The bulletin frankly admits that there are many , difficulties still to be overcome . Yet in the mass the results are simply astounding ? Jut of all proportion to the time and money spent . They have , furthermore . the inestimable advantage of npringing out of the lives of the peoplt : themselves . Democracy function : again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
