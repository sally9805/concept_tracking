txt Canada 's fifth and our first Victory Loan " pulled up more medium savings accounts by the root than we wet of " , writes a correspondent who ought to know . On both sides of the border the best-selling was to the " white , collared class " , which now includes a great many farmers , real and make-believe . On the Canadian aide labor had been on costly strike . It had also subscribed generously to the prior five loans . American labor was not on strike diet when our fifth loan was offered to an unusually well-fed public . But the gesticulatory price lists of a super-heated Government , had , to tell the truth , given the joyful retailer unrestricted access to the pocketbook of the wage-earner . In each country the farmers responded with great gallantry to the government 's urgent request for loans . To many a subscription was as a third crop of the good things which the war had laid up for them . To almost countlessly many more , in spite of the quaint and curious wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a successively accumulating burden . In each country the loan was doubly subscribed . But the " detested bourgeois " will carry the " popular " part of it and pay it off . The grocer , and the grocer 's " boy " and the boy of the grocer 's " boy " will give these loans whatever " popular " peculiarity they permanently retain . A mental note of the fact may prove its own future worth . It should not be assumed and dismissed as self-evident that even the New World can pass from a debt-free status to a per capita liability of $250 , plus a five-fold increase in taxation , without entering on a period of economic reconstruction at home . To toss the fact to one side would be to have its own self-assertive force perhaps most felt when the problems of European convalescence will no longer brook delay . A little boy asked his father why the Egyptian had four large camels pulling one small barrel of water in the Bible picture . The father explained that one camel was worth four barrels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill n camel . Possibly the Egyptian was unduly conservative . Possibly he did not know the traction power of four camels . Yet there is an element , of wisdom in his caution which we may cultivate with profit in our projects in both world politics and world finance .
