at the time of the interview he describes the post of Naval Agent at New York ? an office appreciated by him , as he is frank to admit , for the unrivaled opportunities it afforded for the indulgence of his pet vice of scribbling . At the time when Joseph Bonaparte came to see him he was occupying a house in Whitehall Street which had fallen to the share of his wife upon the death of her father , Peter Kemble , shortly before= " the house , " he writes Irving ( abroad at the time ) , " which we have so often haunted , " and he adds , " If living in a great house constitutes a great man after the fashion of New York , a great man am 1 , at your service .

It is inscribed simply : INTERVIEW WITH JOSEPH BONAPARTE On the return of La Fayette from his tour through the United States , I dined with him in a large company at my brother 's , who was at that time Mayor of the city of New York . Among the guests were the late Cadwallader D. Colden and John J. Morgan , then a member of Congress , and many others whose names it is not worth while to specify . The conversation at table turned on the political situation of France , on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requested information of the General , professing at the same time his inability to comprehend it . La Fayette then entered very frankly into the state of political parties in that country , the Republicans , Carlists , and , lastly , the Orleans party , to which , said he , " I belong . " It will he recollected that during his progress through the United States , La Fayette had uniformly announced himself a Republican , and knowing as I did that the Orleans party had no pretensions to an affinity with Republicanism , this frank avowal excited my surprise at the time and often recurred to my recollection . 1 thought I must have misunderstood the General , and , meeting Mr. Morgan shortly afterward , took occasion to compare notes with him . His recollection perfectly corresponded with mine , and he was equally surprised at the inconsistency of La Fayette 's public with his private declarations . At this period General Charles Lallemand had established a seminary in the city for the education of boys , and my eldest son was one of his scholars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He occasionally dined with my family , and borrowed money which he never repaid . One day after dinner , when no one else was present , the conversation turned on La Fayette , and I then related what he had said at my brother 's table . Lallemand appeared exceedingly surprised and begged me to repeat the conversation , which I did very circumstantially . He made no reply , fell into a reverie , and soon afterward left me . Not long afterward I was somewhat surprised at receiving a message from Joseph Bonaparte expressing a particular desire to see me , and requesting that I would designate the hour for an interview at my house . I complied with his wish , and about twelve o'clock the next day he came alone . After the usual compliments , he proceeded to state the object of his visit . Lallemand had communicated to him the declaration of La Fayette at my brother 's table , and Joseph had called to ascertain if the statement was correct . Perceiving that I was a little surprised , he added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' wishing to know . " I complied with his request , and he then gave me the following curious de-tails : He stated that not long after La Fayette came to this country he paid him a visit at his chateau in New Jersey , and while there had requested a private interview , in the course of which he pronounced France to be on the eve of a revolution which would be fatal to the Bourbon Dynasty , and distinctly and positively proposed to Joseph that if he would advance him two millions of dollars he would make his nephew Napoleon King of France . " 1 confess , " continued Joseph , " that I did not believe him at the time . 1 knew the situation of France was precarious , but had no idea that the revolution was so near at hand , or that La Fayette had the power to direct it so completely as has since appeared . Besides , I had not at my disposal the means he required , for , though rich , the support of various members of my family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exiled friends , left me little beyond my necessary personal expenses . This last was the reason I gave for declining the proposal . It seems , however . that at the moment he was announcing himself to the people of the United States as a Republican , and at your brother 's table as an adherent of the Duke of Orleans , he made me the offer of placing my nephew on the throne of France for the sum of two millions of dollars . I have long believed La Fayette devoid of faith , and now I am satisfied . Future events may give great importance to my knowledge of his character . " In my answer I gave ? him to understand very distinctly that in complying with his request I had no intention of casting the slightest imputation on the character of La Fayette , of whose offer to him I was till now entirely ignorant ; that the General was so intimately associated with our Washington , and had borne so prominent a part in the attainment of cur independence , that no circumstances could ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imputation on his name . Jo-seph assented to this with a bow , but I thought he looked rather disappointed , and our subsequent conversation let me , as I thought , into the secret of the principal object of his visit . I soon perceived that he cherished a deep enmity to La Fayette , whom he considered the great enemy of his brother Napoleon . He proceeded to tell the origin of the General 's opposition , which he denied was founded on any attachment to Republican institutions , but the details arc too long to be inserted here . It must suffice to say that Joseph directly accused him of being the great cause of the surrender of Paris , the abdication of Napoleon , and the subsequent degradation of France . He asserted that La Fayette as vice- president of the Chamber of Deputies took the opportunity presented by the critical situation of Napoleon during the siege of Paris to use all his interest and effort for the purpose of crippling his power at the precise period when the Romans would have created a Dictator . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abdication . Perceiving new restrictions continually proposed for the limitation of that power which should then have been absolute , he despaired of final success , and yielded not so much to the allied armies as to the fetters of La Fayette and his party in the Representative Assembly . Most unquestionably history justifies these assertions , for it distinctly appears that such was the course pursued by the party of which La Fayette was the head . Of his motives , God alone can judge . It was assuredly no time to propose restrictions when nothing but a Dictator could save the state . Our interview lasted upward of three hours , in the course of which Joseph became not only warm , but eloquent on the subject of his brother , although he spoke but indifferent English and I was ignorant of French . He denied that Napoleon was a tyrant . He was the creature of necessity , and his ambition was imposed upon him as a solemn , imperative duty . He stood forth the regenerator of the age and was placed in a situation where to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always going forward . The institutions which he had established in France by his absolute will were yet highly favorable to the freedom and happiness of mankind and especially to the people of France who at that moment were in the enjoyment of rights denied to the rest of Europe . Napoleon was therefore an object of extreme jealousy , of bitter , enduring hate , for he had broken the great Arch of Legitimacy ? he had humbled Kings and exalted the People . His existence and his power were incompatible with the safety of ancient abuses , and hence he knew that no permanent repose could be enjoyed by Europe unless the old established despotisms were so humbled as to be acquiescent , or their systems so modified as to associate harmoniously with that which he had established in France . Inshort , he well knew that all the great powers of Europe were either secretly or openly united against him and that his son could never reign in peace unless the enemies of France were absolutely subdued into acquiescence beforehand . His latter wars , though apparently offensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to disarm enemies who , as plainly appeared in the end , were only waiting for an opportunity to wield them to his destruction . " My brother , " concluded he , " would during the years of his undisturbed reign have been glad of repose for the remainder of his life . But his position and his destiny would not permit . It seems that a great martyr was necessary to lead the way to the freedom of Europe , and none more illustrious than my brother could have been selected from the race of mankind . " There was a Fine bust of Napoleon by Canova in the room , and while Joseph was thus vindicating his brother with eloquent , affectionate enthusiasm , I thought I never saw a more striking likeness than between the two . Joseph was dressed very neatly , but very plainly , in a blue coat and pantaloons and white waistcoat . He had gradually become exceedingly animated , having at length risen from his chair , and , standing directly in front of the bust , could scarcely refrain from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , actions , motives , and destiny will probably remain subjects of unceasing doubt , inveterate controversy . To me it appears that the future history of the world will demonstrate that , with the exception of Washington , he has done more for the liberties of mankind than any other man that ever lived . Whether such was his object , or whether he was only an instrument of Providence in bringing about eventually results which he neither desired nor anticipated , is more then belongs to human sagacity to decide . Joseph spoke with contempt of the pretended private conversations , secret motives , and still more secret interviews of Napoleon with different persons , most especially his brothers , which had been laid before the world in history and memoirs . Among others he instanced a particular account of the interview between himself and Napoleon when the latter sent for him from Naples to Bayonne in order to make him King of Spain , in which the writer had detailed the very words that passed between them . " How should these people know anything about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present but oursel ves ; I have never opened my lips on the subject , and , as to my brother , he never told anything that was not necessary to be known . To show you how much of the matter was known by this writer , I will tell you exactly how it was . You may recollect I was at that time King of Naples . The people were quiet , I may say happy , under my government , and , as for myself , I had no ambition to occupy any other throne . I n this state o f things I was sent for by mybrother and set out for Bayonne without in the least suspecting his object . On my arrival he conducted me to his private closet , and , being a man of few words and little ceremony , abruptly said , ' have sent foryou , Joseph , to make you King of Spain . ' " I replied I had no wish to be King of Spain , or to exchange a quiet , peaceable throne to reign over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their own legitimate sovereigns . I begged him therefore to excuse me and named some of his most distinguished marshals in my stead . But my brother objected . ' Europe , ' said he , ' is accustomed to see my brothers made kings , and will acquiesce in your elevation to the throne of Spain not only because you are already a king , but because you are my brother . The monarchs of Europe who occupy their hereditarythrones , seeing that I have only a certain number of brothers , will perceive that I can not make more than a certain number of kings without going out of my own family , and will therefore submit to their elevation , but if I once begin with my marshals they will not know where I mean to stop , and will combine against me as an absolute measure of self-defense . You must go , Joseph . ' ' But who will you make King of Naples ? ' asked I. " Murat ? he is my brother-in-law . ' " I consented at last most unwillingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Several things occurred in this long interview which convinced me that Joseph looked anxiously , if not confidently , to the elevation of his nephew , young Napoleon , to the throne of France , and that preliminary measures were at that time going on . I took occasion to express my sincere regrets at the course pursued by the Imperial Court toward this devoted youth , who was little less than a state prisoner , a victim to the jealous , dastardly policy of Austria and her allies . Joseph showed me a letter which , being in cipher , he interpreted for me , from which it appeared that the agents of the Napoleon party in France had at length succeeded in opening a correspondence with the young man , who , however , died not long after , and this , 1 imagine , put a final stop to all the hopes of the Bonaparte family in France . Not long after this interview Lallemand had received permission to return to France . and on his departure was charged with important communications which he betrayed to Louis Philippe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Governor of the important frontier post of Strasbourg . When Joseph left me , the impression on my mind was that had he not been Napoleon 's brother he would have passed for a very remarkable man . I had almost forgot to mention that the conversation having incidentally turned toward his chateau at Borden-town , he mentioned as the principal reason for choosing that situation a conversation with Napoleon , I think immediately , or nor long after , Napoleon 's return from Russia . They were alone together , and his brother , laying a large map of the United States on a table , said : " Joseph , it is very probable that the time is not distant when you and I will be forced to seek an asylum in the United States . Come , let us look out the best spot . " After a careful examination they decided that the most desirable place was somewhere between the Delaware and Hudson in the state of New Jersey . Napoleon was destined to a slow and painful sacrifice , but Joseph found refuge in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a home by the recollection of the prophetic interview with his brother . J. K. P. The meeting between Lafayette and Joseph Bonaparte referred to in the " Interview " occurred at Bordentown on the z6th of September , 1824 . The General was under obligations to Napoleon 's brother , if only of a very general and little personal nature . Joseph had been the negotiator of the Treaty of Campo Formio , under which Lafayette had obtained his release from an Austrian dungeon . Furthermore , he had been the guest of Joseph at Mortefontaine on the occasion of the signing of the new treaty between France and the United States , likewise negotiated by Joseph . It was natural that he should turn aside from his triumphal progress to greet his distinguished compatriot now that their respective positions were to a certain extent reversed . The visit is mentioned by Lafayette 's secretary , Levasseur , who , however , describes it only on its external , spectacular side ? the people from the surrounding country swarming over the grounds of Point Breeze to get a look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their children a blessing or other mark of recognition from the illustrious Friend of Liberty . Joseph , the secretary tells us , was good-natured about it ; indeed , he was liberal at all times in allowing the public access to his estate , and was accustomed in particular to receive the people of Bordentown at a great display of fireworks each Fourth of July . The private conversation between the two men occurred in the study before dinner , and is related in substance by Charles Jared Ingersoll , Bonaparte 's friend , in his History of the Second War between the United States and England . Lafayette , according to this statement , began by saying that he regretted i the part he had taken in the restoration of the Bourbons ; their dynasty could not endure , as it clashed too much with national sentiment ; every one was now convinced that the Emperor 's son would be the best representative of the reforms accomplished by the Revolution . A donation of two million francs ( not dollars ) by Joseph , to be placed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be sufficient to place Napoleon II . on the throne within two years ' time . Joseph declined the proposal , partly because of shortness of funds , partly because he mistrusted Lafayette 's ability to carry it out . Ingersoll adds : Joseph and Lafayette parted on the kindest terms , which were never interrupted , although six years afterward they differed as much as ever on Lafayette 's last , and again unfortunate , instrumentality in the attempt to restore a Bourbon monarch . Two discrepancies ? neither of them very important -- may be noted in the accounts of the interview given by Joseph to Ingersoll and Paulding respectively . One concernsthe sum men-tioned , which i s obviously d u e to a misunderstanding ; the other is the omission in the interview with Paulding of any mention of a committee to have the custody of the proposed fund . No one acquainted with Lafayette 's character , however ? particularly with his reputation for lavish generosity and disinterested giving ? could for a moment entertain the hypothesis that the General was proposing a bribe . Almost at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000 and a township of land , voted him by Congress , and discouraged the efforts undertaken in several of the states to offer him money . There remains the question of Lafayette 's sincerity , which , despite Ingersoll 's assertion of their continued friendship , was evidently gravely compromised in Bonaparte 's eyes at the time of his visit to Paulding . Was Lafayette a Republican , an Orleanist , a Bonapartist , or more simply a believer in constitutional liberty , ready to take advantage of any party to secure an advance in the general direction of his ideals ? ' The subsequent correspondence between himself and Bonaparte sheds considerable light upon this pies-don . Immediately upon hearing of the Revolution of 183o , Joseph wrote to Lafayette as the Frenchman who best knew his thoughts , taking occasion at the same time to express entire confidence in his character . Lafayette replied with every evidence of affection and esteem , as well as with considerable frankness . You have been disappointed in me during these latest happenings he writes , not because T had committed myself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to yourself , " Since Lafayette has felt it incumbent on him in view of the existing conditions to relax his well-known and oft- proclaimed preference for completely republican institutions , why has this concession been exerted to the advantage of another family than my own ? Has he forgotten that three million votes have accredited the imperial dynasty ? " . . . The first condition of republican convictions being a respect for the general will , I was prevented from proposing a purely American constitution , the best of all in my eyes ; to have done so would have been to disregard the voice of the majority , to risk civil strife , and to invite a foreign war . If I was mistaken , it was at least against my constant inclination , and supposing that I was actuated by a vulgar ambition , even against what would have been called my own interest . A popular throne in the name of the national sovereignty , surrounded by republican institutions ? that is what we considered practicable .. . . I might confine myself to saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owe to your friendship my full and frank opinion . The Napoleonic system has been radiant with glory , but stamped with despotism , aristocracy , and servitude , and if there be a combination that could make these scourges tolerable and almost popular in France ( which God forbid ! ) , it would he a return of the imperial regime . Besides this , the son of your immortal brother has become an Austrian prince , and you know what the cabinet of Vienna is . There , my dear Count , in spite of my personal feelings toward you , von have the reasons which have prevented me from desiring the re-establishment of a throne whose constant tendency toward ancient errors was demonstrated during the Hundred Days . This was in 183o . May it have been that in 1824 ? six years earlier ? Lafayette , while holding the same opinion , was in doubt whether Louis Philippe or the young Napoleon was more likely to provide the liberal monarchy of which the French nation had need , and , in the throes of that doubt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ? To understand this position one has to remember that the name " Republic " in France was laden still with recollections of the Terror ; that at no time between the close of the great Revolution and the later years of the reign of Louis Philippe would it have entered the region of practical politics to propose a revival of the republican regime . Lafayette himself had recoiled from participation in the later governmental stages of the earlier republic ; conserv- ing his theoretical principles , he had subsequently held aloof from both the Empire and from the Bourbon monarchy he had helped to restore . In America he might reasonably and justly describe himself as a Republican ; to a group of friends at a private table in a discussion of contemporary French politics he might well refer to the Orleanist party as the one to which he " belonged " in the sense that he was compelled to act with its representatives . In the privacy of Bonaparte 's study was he betrayed by the good feeling of the moment ? the AN INTERVIEW WITH sympathetic atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? into a profession of the other alternative ? Or did he only mean to sound Joseph as to the lengths he was prepared to go in an attempt to restore his nephew to the throne ? Lafayette 's biographers all describe him as impulsive and prone to give his confidence on insufficient grounds . To Ingersoll Joseph writes on January 2 , 1831 , that he has sure information that Lafayette proposed the exclusion of the Bourbons in the preceding July , and was willing to assent to the proclamation of young Napoleon , but yielded , after a defense lasting thirty hours , to the arguments of those who wanted the Duke of Orleans . In another letter , written in the following March , he admits , however , that Lafayette has informed him that in his ( the General 's ) opinion the Duke of Orleans alone was in a position to prevent war , and Joseph hints his belief that Lafayette was duped again . Ingersoll says : Joseph always held that on several great conjunctures Lafayette misjudged French interest , welfare , and glory ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army in 1792 ; again by his acquiescence in the Bourbon restoration of 1815 ; and a third time when he helped the Duke of Orleans to the throne : all calamities for his country . That this was Joseph 's final judgment we may well believe . It is not incompatible with a belief in Lafayette 's integrity , which , although shaken for a moment at the time of his visit to Paulding , was in all probability quickly reestablished , as witness his reply to the letter of Lafayette last quoted : I am convinced that on this occasion , too , you have acted as you judged yourself bound in conscience to do . Please believe , my dear NAPOLEON 'S BROTHER S21 General , that I am full of esteem , gratitude , and friendship for you , against wind and tide . That it will also be the verdict of history it may be going too far to assert , yet historians are agreed that Lafayette was more remarkable for his qualities of heart than of head . " A political ninny , " Napoleon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eternal dupe of men and things . " But Taine , taking note of it , writes : With Lafayette and some others one embarrassing detail remains , namely , proven disinterestedness , constant solicitude for the public good , respect for others , the authority of conscience , lovalt'r , and good faith ; in short , ' pure and noble motives . " A weak man , " again he has been called , " overridden by the abstract principles he professed . " But it is not a characteristic of weakness to remain faithful throughout a long career in troubled times to a single ideal , no matter how abstract . Matched by the standard of public men in France who passed from Bourbon to Bonaparte and back again within a space of a few months , he appears a model of consistency . That he was venal , nobody has ever asserted . That he was ready upon more than one occasion to sacrifice himself and his possessions for the cause of liberty is amply admitted . If he contemplated for an instant lending his influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in acceptance of the dictum announced by Joseph himself ? " Individual families have duties to perform in their relation to nations , but nations alone have rights to exercise . " The claim of Napoleon 's son , on this theory , rested upon his proclamation by the deputies in 18r 5 , and was valid only until the nation made another choice .
