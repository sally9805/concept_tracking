WHITE 'S SEVEN GREAT STATES-MEN . Seven Great Statesmen in the Warfaire of Humanity With Unreason . By Andrew Dickson White . New - York : The Century Co. $2.50 net . In a certain sense this book may be regarded as a sequel to President White 's well-known " History of the Warfare of Science with Theology " ; but he here pursues the more vivid and concrete method of teaching by biography . Principles never exert their greatest influence until they are embodied in a man . So Mr. White has chosen seven individuals through whom to illustrate the chief advance in European statesmanship during the past three centuries . The list is significant ; it contains two Italians ? Sarpi and Cayour ; three Germans ? Thomasius , Stein , and Bismarck ; one HollanderGrotius , and one Frenchman ? Turgot . It will be observed that there are no Spaniards and no Britons . 6for the obvious reason that since 1600 Spain has produced no statesmen of the first rank , while the British statesmen have been busy ' in extending and ' perfecting Principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application . This is as true of Hampden as of Chatham and-'Burke , of Pitt as of RUssell and Gladstone . Crom= well , ' the - transcendent British statesman since 1600 , is excluded on the same ground that Napoleon and Frederick are . Having in mind Mr. White 's qualifying phrase ? " in the warfare of humanity with unreason " ? we find his choice well justified ; for this - qualification rules out such statesmen as Alberoni and Metternich , whose strength lay in so combining and controlling the forces of unreason that they postponed the emancipation of humanity . Mr. , White 's method is straightforward . He gives a sufficient biography of his subject ; describes the time and the environment ; and then states , the doctrines which the man put forth , or his achievements in actual statecraft . In this way , he emphasizes what Is really important and omits the superfluous . Several of his essays-=the Grotius , Thomasius , Turga , and Stein , for example  --  are the best in . English on those men , if we judge them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set himself and has consistently observed . The biography of Sarpi also is full of pith , although the account of Sarpi 's posthumdus persecution might ' be , condensed ; and the whole may profitably be supplemented by Horatio Brown 's Taylorian Lecture . Mr. White 's Ca-your , while containing the essential facts , seems less artistically fused - than his Bismarck , which is by far the longest of these studies , and paints what any one save a German idolater must regard as a very sympathetic portrait of the Iron Chancellor . ' Personal and official relations with the man , and a familiar acquaintance of half a century with Germany , have evidently contributed to the success of the Bismarck . - If we inquire what each of these seven men did to entitle him to a place in this group , we get some idea of the horrors from which mankind has emerged during the past three hundred years . Sarpi stands for all time as the champion of secular government against ecclesiastical domination . The arguments by which he resisted the pretensions of Pope Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Greeks , or Anglicans , or any other religionists in a similar situation . What gave edge to the Venetian resistance which Sarpi led was the fact that Venice was a devout Catholic country in matters of religion . The policy of state independence from Clerical rule has gone on penetrating every Catholic nation . At each struggle forward towards liberty the people , by a sure instinct , have sought first " to destroy priestly control . Thereby they follow Sarpi 's example , though they know it not : and Sarpi , we need hardly : point out , had behind him all the great Catholics who agreed with Dante in condemning the blending of secular and religious concerns at'Rome . ' Grotius also prOclaimed beneficent doctrines of universal'application .. Mr. White describes forcibly the awful condition of the world into which he was born , a world in which war was almost the normal state of man , and satanic cruelties were practised Amid this welter of evil Grotius published in 1625 his work , " De Jure Belli ac PaciS , " " the most beneficent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It asserted the rights of non-combatants ; it appealed to arbitration ; it urged that the solidarity of civilized nations imposed upon them the obligation to prevent any of their members from plunging into war to the injury of all ; it preached tolerance . Grotius 's gospel has become so integral a part of the belief of enlightened men and women , that it is hard to realize that there was a time when it was novel and denied . Yet the great hook was speedily put on the Index and kept there ; and militarism was never so scientifically organized as it is to-day . The chief contributions of Thomasius to human progress were his opposition to persecution for witchcraft and to judicial torture . Perhaps it is well that mankind forgets easily , because if they remembered the atrocities which their grandfathers committed they would be paralyzed by remorse ; and yet ; as a warning to what lengths unreason may go , the history of witchcraft ought to be kept fresh . Protestants and Catholics were alike guilty of persecution , but where the victims of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter suffered by thousands . Against this abomination and against procedure by torture Thomasius wrought manfully , and with such success that before his death in 1728 he beheld the tide of reform rising . These three men ? Sarpi , Grotius , and Thomasius  --  strove to abolish evils which did not belong to any particular time , race , or creed : for ecclesiastical truculence , war-lust , cruelty , and intolerance are among the commonplaces of history . But Mr. White 's remaining four statesmen devoted themselves to the more specific task of destroying or transforming feudalism . Thus we find Turgot  --  of whom Mr. White writes with well-merited enthusiasm  --  busied with affairs of commerce and of agriculture , bent on removing unjust taxes , and on opening the door of opportunity to the downtrodden classes . Turgot sought to overthrow neither the King nor the nobility , but to curtail their insatiate greed in order that those who made up the strength of the nation should share in the wealth produced by their labor and should enjoy political rights . Stein performed a somewhat similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task of abolishing the old regime and of creating United Italy . He had to overcome not only class privilege and absolutism , but the tenacious Papal institution and the practical suzerainty of Austria over three-fourth ; of the Peninsula . His work on . one side resembled that of Sarpi , on another that of Turgot , on a third that of Bismarck . Bismarck , indeed , is the one statesman whose inclusion in this group may be questioned . Mr. White hardly makes clear what contribution the Iron Chancellor made to the warfare of humanity with unreason . He unified Germany , and in so doing ' he swept away many medinvalisms , not because they were medieval or unreasonable , but because they interfered with the working of a centralized Imperial government in which the sovereign should be almost an autocrat . Bismarck 's guiding principle was not progress , but reaction . His prototype as a nation-builder is Richelieu ; as a law-maker it is either of the great Hapsburgs , Leopold or Joseph , with their enlightened despotism . Bismarck had no solution save repression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the single wad democracy . His legislation against Socialism was a flimsy makeshift , which failed from the start . In economics , he fell back on protection and subsidies . In his exaggeration of ' militarism he did homage to War  --  the embodiment of inhumanity and unreason . Even in his Kuiturkainpf he seemed to be inspired by policy rather than by principle . If it turns out that mankind can not stand liberty , then Bismarck , as the foremost modern apostle of authority , will have a message for future statesmen ; but if liberty be the , goal towards which evolution journeys , those who trampled on liberty will be regarded as allies of Unreason . Then Bismarck will not be grouped with Sarpi , Grotius , and Cavour , but with the welders of empire by blood and iron . The fame of having unified Germany can never be taken away from him . We wish that Mr. White had surveyed in a final essay the course of statesmanship , which we have so briefly glanced at , and had drawn parallels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . But in these studies he has furnished material from which readers can make their own comparisons . At many points he discusses questions which press upon us to-day . He lights up his very wide range of information with personal anecdotes , and he keeps constantly before us the historical conditions amid which his heroes lived . It is almost needless to say that he confirms his statements by constant reference to sources . No other foreigner , for instance , has read so exhaustively as he in Sarpi literature . And he is essentially fair-minded , although he never hides his detestation of bigotry , superstition , and cruelty . This book ought to do much towards correcting popular misconceptions as to what makes a statesman . Especially in : America is that title bestowed with such indiscriminate profusion that it has come to mean little . An excellent series of biographies deals with some forty American statesmen . Judged by Mr. White 's Seven , only three or four of these forty were of the great breed . His book may also reassure those perons who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another name for volubility . Not one , of these - seven was an haranguer : all of them were men of thought ; Sarpi , Turgot , Stein , Cavour , and Bismarck were men of action , while Grotius and Thomasius proved that a thinker may deserve by his pen to rank among the world 's statesmen . One other fact is shown by Mr. White 's heroes : inflexibility of purpose was a trait common to them all  --  even to Bismarck , who was unblushingly opportunist in his political dealings but steadfast in his authoritarian ideal . We predict for Mr. White 's volume a wide reading among the readers whose opinion counts . CURRENT FICTION . Clayhanger . By Arnold Bennett . New York : E. P. Dutton &; Co . Helen with the High Hand : An Idyllic Diversion By Arnold Bennett . New York : George H. Doran Co . " Clayhanger " is another chronicle of the " Five Towns , " as long and as minute as " The Old . Wives ' Tale " ; and readers who found that provincial epic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edwin Clayhanger is not an exciting person : a sort of Mr. Polly sans humor and inspiration . He is the son , of a self-made printer in Bursley . His education is small , and his travels , up to that middle age at which ( for the moment ) we leave him , have extended several times to London , and once to Brighton . He has some mental ability and more self-sufficiency . The story is told so scrupulously from his point of view that he seems almost to have told it himself . It is all serious business to him ; why should it not be to us ? And if it is also rather . monotonous business , why should we not feel that , too ? Unless for that chance evening at the Dragon , with the Mutual Burial Club , and the vision of the ravishing Florence Simcox  --  unless for this one innocent lapse into a region of fleshly joysClayhanger 's Youth is unrelieved by the sowing of wild oats . Its one dream is escape from the printing-shop , and the achievement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a self-wrought product and can not value the stuff that dreams are made on . Clayhanger junior 's fight for his own future is quickly over . When the old man finally dies ' ? this mercilessly detailed record of his lingering and doddering end the most ' exacting realist of us might wish abridged  --  the time for dreams is past , and the son settles down to middle age , with a middle-aged sister whose share of romance has been far smaller than his own . For in young manhood he has loved and lost a girl of no ordinary type ; and toward the end of this chronicle , just as a crusty and finicking bachelorhood seems to have claimed him , he finds her again . Why she has jilted him years before remains a mystery . That it is not to remain so , and that the unmitigatedjaappiness ever after of the reunited pair is not to be taken for granted , is sufficiently guaranteed by the note appended to these seven hundred pages : The author will in 1911 publish a novel dealing with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage with Edwin . This will be followed by a novel dealing with the marriage . " Helen with the High Hand , " as the sub-title suggests , though it is also a " Five Towns " tale , represents a deliberate relaxation of Mr. Bennett 's scrupulous attention to the not always Cowardly fact ( speaking romantically ) of his provincial scene . Helen and her captive uncle are a charming pair who would be altogether out of their element in an " Old Wives ' Tale " or a " Clayhanger . " They give play to that Puckish spirit over which , when he pleases , Mr. Bennett has full control , but which remains a very real part of him . It has amused him to , chronicle the feats of Helen , and the result is amusing . But we must continue to think that the real business of this versatile writer is the serious business of interpreting his Five Towns in the light of that quiet and , if you will , sombre irony which distinguishes him from Mr. Hardy or Mr. Phillpotts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The Century Co . We had heard of matrimonial bureaus and of **34;752;TOOLONG , but never before of professional love-letters at so much the week . Once having hit upon this novel idea , a less capable mind than the author 's would have directed it to the unhappily married or to those past the marriageable age ; but that a young man engaged to a Boston bud should be the chief subscriber furnishes not only the proper thorn for the rose of romance in this twentieth century , but much the right sort of flourish and bravado , too . One trembles a little for the author when one realizes that she is actually going to put through such a proposition . " The Diary of Adam " was a farcical idea , but many have wished that even Mark Twain had stopped at the mere title . And to write love-letters advertised at the outset to be professional is not easy . Miss Abbott neatly solves the problem by not being professional at all , and by making her heroine  --  the head of " The Serial-Letter Co. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For those who like them , the hero is built on Mr. Davis 's rococo lines ; and though the rendering of poetic justice at the close does not take long , the sentimentally-minded need have no fear of being cheated of a thrill . The Yardstick Man . By Arthur Goodrich . New York : D. Appleton &; Co . The best thing to be said of this story is that the last seventy-five pages are markedly superior to those that precede . This , as novels go , is by no means common . The amiable dilettantism of the author 's previous books has risen to real vigor and sincerity in the portrayal of the financial and moral crisis in which Jones , a " successful " business man , finds himself involved . That he emerges with credit from such a crisis is due to the generosity of a moderately young Lochinvar , Roger Mathewson , a former college acquaintance , who , as an emissary of the Pacific and Eastern Railway , comes in from the West to Manhattan , tactfully declines to run away with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a passing mood of revolt , his unconquerable boyishness to , " Jones.eY 's " aridity  --  defeats the money baron , John P. Carnahan , and , incidentally , Jones , at his own , game of stock-juggling , and then loftily refuses to drive said Jones into bankruptcy . The tale is not unduly spun out , and the style , if not one of distinction , is , at any rate , somewhat above mediocrity . There are several faults in the story , the most grievous of which is the attempted characterization of a college professor , who is on a visit to raise funds for his beloved Credmore . His absurd mannerisms and almost as absurd language are not reflected from the mirror of nature . The author 's sense of humor , for the most part delicate , here plays him false . TILE LETTERS OF ERASMUS . Opus Epistolarum Des . Erasrai Roterodami denuo recognitum et auctum per P. S. Allen , M.A. , Collegii 1VIertonensis Socium . Tom . II , 1514-1517 . New York : Henry Frowde. $5.75 . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertaking ( Watson , January 24 , 1907 ) , commented on the inspiring spectacle presented by the friendly rivalry of two Oxford men at work on the Letters of Erasmus , one printing them in the original , the other in. an English version . The second volume of Mr. Nichols 's translation carried the letters clown to 1517 ( see the Nation , January 12 , 1905 ) , and we now have the Latin text brought to the same year . Of the scholarly zeal of Mr. Allen in his laborious task we shall not speak again at length . But we may note that this Second volume required more care and patience than did the first ; here first we come upon letters which are printed . only from rough drafts . As these were often hasty scrawls with additions wandering up and down the pages and with many deletions , the nicest judgment was-required in forming a text from them . As for the substance of these letters-from August , 1514 ; to , June , 1517 , they are of course largely concerned with matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us very close to the heart of the writer or re . mpient . Here and there one marks a sentence or phrase for the nice turn or the language or for the glimpse it offers-into some aspect of old life . Now and then we seem to get a hint of the new style and model that were to create the , literature of the northern lands , as , for instance , in such a phrase as litteratce voluptatis sensu tangi ( p. 97 ) , or in such a sentence as this : Proinde videbar repperisse rationem ut delicatis anam , i.s hac arte tanquam obreperem et cum voluptate quaque meclerer ( p. 91 ) , in which an attentive ear may catch suggestions of many things to come , down to Sainte-Beuve 's sad comfort in being le Bernier des delicats . Oftener we may hear the forerunner of Voltaire , as in the words of one of Erasmus 's correspondents which might well have come from Erasmus himself : Bed quanivis ccetera fragilis , studio tamen sum o bfirmatissimus ; quae sines res me et rellvit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just the tone one hears in the letters of students to-day ; indeed , it sometimes-almost seems as if that power of reflection and consolation in study was slipping away from our scholars , and books-were becoming-to them more and more a burden . The two most important documents in this volume  --  and in the whole collection ? are the long autobiographical letter to a certain Lambert Grunnius written from London in August of 1516 , and the letter to Martin Dorp , written from Antwerp in May of 1515 . Mr. Allen is inclined to agree with Mr. Nichols in holding Grunnius to be a pure figment , and we have already recorded our opinion that this is the simplest explanation of a thorny question . The letter to Dorp , which makes almost a little book in itself , is Erasmus 's well-known defence of his " MoriE Encomium " and of his desertion of theology for literature . It is-one of the earliest documents in the long battle of the wits that was then opening , and one of the most interesting . Change " theology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hearing by anticipation the quarrel of Pope with his Tibbald . It would be an entertaining study , indeed , with this letter as starting point , to portray Erasmus as the first of the " wits " ? at least the first in northern lands . This letter should not be left without reference to the phrases in it which give an interpretation of Erasmus 's use of the word stultttsa often missed by his critics and biographers . It is that illusion of the heart , appearing to the reason as folly , which " overcomes all the wisdom of the world . " Story or the Great American Fortunes . By Gustavus Myers . Vol . III . Chicago : Charles H. Kerr &; Co. $1.50 . This volume of Mr. Myers 's work takes up the achievements of certain contemporary millionaires ; principally , so far as space is concerned , J. Pierpont Morgan . The book appeared at a moment when three magazines were beginning , each on its own account , a " popular sketch " of Mr. Morgan 's career in serial form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have led the familiar Man from Mars to suppose that the foremost citizen of the Republic was being chronicled . It has never , in fact , been wholly clear whether this unusual amount of description , bibgraphy , and analysis , in the case of a career in high finance , was recognition of the fact , sometimes alleged , that the " multimillionaire " nowadays shares the honors of public pre-eminence with the statesman and the writer of short stories , or was merely an effort to hunt down wickednem in high places The same doubt existed regarding the prolonged embalming of John D Rockefeller in the columns of the same magazines . The historians of Mr. Morgan throw little light on this question . Some of them , like Mr Steffens in Everybody 's , affect the mysterious air of a Sherlock Holmes unravelling the secret crimes of finance . They and the anonymous authorities with whom their long conversations on the subject are reported " laugh cynically , " " mutter , " and " whisper , " as they run upon one or another clue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Turner in McClure 's , apply themselves to a study of inheritances , traits , and environment , as if admitting that the subject of their discussions is interesting solely in himself Most of them , it must frankly be admitted , approach the matter with strong signs of preconceived opinion , not of a flattering character , whose correctness they mean to prove , whether or no . Of this type of discussion , Mr. Myers 's book is pre-eminent We hold no brief for the " multi-millionaires " We have , indeed , Dur selves been assured by high authority in the railway and industrial world , and by authority as far as possible removed from the field of muckraking , that there are few if any of the prodigious American fortunes , the history of whose accumulation would not present at least one chapter of questionable business morality . Be this as it may ; we insist nevertheless that when an historian sets out to tell the story of a man or a ea- ' reer , it is his business to tell it fairly . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ethical considerations , it does not follow that the next action is of necessity similar . But this is precisely what Mr. Myers takes for granted . The presumption with which he examines each successive achievement is that there must have been something wrong about it . Now , to study a great financial operation , with a view to making sure whether it was really a " square deal " or not , is assuredly the financial historian 's duty . But he must also know all the facts and circumstances before he is entitled to pass judgment . Thus , the purchase by Drexel , Morgan &; Co. of a United States government loan in 1877 , and their prompt re-sale of it at an advance of 1 to 4 per cent. , is denounced by Mr. Myers as " one of the very worst cases ever known of the people being betrayed " Perhaps so ; perhaps not . In order to criticise the affair intelligently , it is essential to know what was the real condition of the open investment market where Mr. Myers so confidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without Intermediaries " He gives not the least evidence of having ever examined or considered that question , or the further question , what incidental profits great international banking houses usually get for lending their credit to the placing of loans even for great foreign governments . After this , it is not surprising to find the author denouncing the episode of 1895 , when the tankers are pictured as " compelling " a bond issue and then " milking " the government on the terms . Again perhaps so , and perhaps not ; the terms were certainly harsh . But we find no evidence that the author has ever reflected on the part played by inflation of the currency through the Silver-Purchase Act of 1890 , and by the emptying of the Treasury through the McKinley Revenue Law of the same year . The conclusions arrived at may conceivably be correct ; the method of arriving at them is not deserving of serious consideration . Historically , it is all quite of a piece with Mr. Myers 's offhand acceptance , in a sentence or two , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We should hardly deem it worth while to devote thus much attention to a discussion of the sort , but for the fact that such haphazard assertions and deductions do harm , and do it , not to the men or institutions against which they are supposed to be directed , but to the cause of financial reform which they profess to uphold . That the methods of what has come to be known as High Finance in Wall Street have repeatedly been objectionable in principle , illegal in practice , and utterly demoralizing in influence , is nowadays scarcely a debat able question . The efforts of sound thinkers and independent-spirited legislators have been directed towards punishing such abuses where . they can be punished , and preventing them at all times . The new insurance law and the new trust company law of Gov . Hughes 's State administration ; the Supreme Court decisions under the Anti-Trust Law , at the instance of President Roosevelt 's Administration ; the new powers with which the Public Service Commissions and the Interstate Commerce Commission have been clothed ; the- extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitalization of new enterprises , on recapitalization of old , and on methods of speculation in the stock exchanges  --  all these are steps in the same direction . Further progress in that direction will be achieved , however , not at all through indiscriminate clamor at everything done by great banking interests , but by careful , thorough , and entirely fair examination of every episode involving the old-time financial practices . - Nothing in Mr. Myers 's book is more striking an instance of the wrong way of writing financial history than his description of Mr. Morgan 's part in the panic of 1907 . Two legends have already grown up regarding the incident of October 24 , when the Stock Exchange had approached the point of general suspension of payments , and when J. P. Morgan &; Co. appeared as lenders of $25,000,000 , at high rates , to avert the catastrophe . One , the popular legend , regards Mr. Morgan as a sort of demigod who had answered the prayers of Wall Street and descended upon it in a benevolent shower of gold . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because that statesman gravely expounded it to Congress in 1908 ? assumes the existence of a group of millionaires who create both prosperity and adversity for their own wicked ends , and who caused with that purpose the panic of 1907 , by hiding away $25,000,000 in cold cash , which Mr. Morgan suddenly produced and sold at exorbitant rates to Wall Street , whin he could see no further advantage to be gained . Both conceptions of Mr. Morgan 's part in the panic are picturesque ; Mr. Myers , it hardly need be said , accepts the second . One is as reluctant to destroy either picture as to destroy the time-honored narratives of Romulus and the wolf , or of Joshua and the sun . Such stories make for the winter fireside 's entertainment . But the simple fact , which any one who cared to inquire might have learned , is that on October 24 , 1907 , the New York banks themselves were in a panic ; that they had begun to refuse to lend , in violation of the soundest principles of dealing with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth the desperate sitNation to the banks , enlisting Mr. Morgan 's large personal influence to support him ; that the banks yielded , issuing $25,000,000 in new credits through recourse to clearinghouse loan certificates ; that they fixed a high rate of interest , in line with the well-established rule that only thus could the loans be sure of going to the people who really needed them ; and that Mr. Morgan 's house was employed to offer the bank loans ou the Stock Exchange . Quiet Days in Spain . By C. Bogue . Luffmann . New York : E. P. Dutton &; Co. $2 net . The impression made by Mr. Luffmann 's book is that the author has been sharing the everyday life of the Peninsula , a life still destitute of almost every domestic comfort known to modern civilization . He winters on a small estate in the bleak hills of the Sierra Nevada , and summers in the Vega of Malaga with an old woman who furnishes his table for six and eight pence a week . His book has little to say of cathedrals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notebook of the would-be vagabond who , in search of the glamour and romanticism of Gautier 's time , , snapshots Spain from the third-class window and the casa de huespetles . The author says , " the aim has been to write provincially  --  to set the local fact on its ground . " In this he has succeeded . A- multitude of humble details lend unusual freshness to what is rather a picture than a narrative , with all the continuity and intimacy that distinguish living from sightseeing and reality from pose . That contradictions abound is proof of truthfulness , for Spain is the land of contradictions. , The author is not so happy in his reflections , for it is dangerous to generalize about a whole made up of such parts as Castile , Catalonia , Biscaya , and Andalusia , and it would lead one far afield if one began to answer the challenge of his general statementS . The impress left by the Moor upon Spain is fundamental , but it is absurd to say that " all his the Spaniard 's dreams are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West . His old romances are based entirely on Arabic themes ; his modern stage characters hail from Morocco ; his lover of fiction is under the spell of eyes which have captivated him in Tangier " ( p. vii ) . To affirm that " all decrees are of a suppressive character ; press censorship ; no public meeting ; no free education ; no unions or alliances ; no emigration without permit ; no petitions for work nor demonstrations against rapacious authority " ( p. ix ) , is to convey an altogether false idea of contemporary Spain . The statement that " the fingers are used alike by rich and poor in carrying food to the mouth . . . . In the highest society food is handled a great deal , and it is a mark of attention to be fed from the fingers " ( p. 96 ) , might apply to Persia , but certainly not to Spain . The author 's habit of intruding upon the reader- his personal views of life reminds one of Montaigne , though the manner is not so happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " nothing is important which man may do . It may be necessary for the moment ; at the next a new necessity will arise . Consider what any reform has ever done . Never has there been one which did not increase human misery . " For all this , the book may be heartily commended for its portrayal of provincial life ,  - -  for its homely illustrations of local character , and for the many interesting facts which find no place in handbooks or among the superficial notes of the ordinary traveller . Practical Real Estate Methods . New York : Doubleday , Page &; Co. $2 net . This volume comprises the addresses delivered during the last five years to the real estate classes of the West Side Young Men 's Christian Association of New York . Some thirty different enparts have here expressed themselves upon various real estate problems . Francis E. Ward , former president of the Real Estate Board of Brokers , and Joseph P. Day , the present president , are among the contributors . The public questions pertaining to realty , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawson Purdy and Lawrence Vanier , respectively . An examination of the volume reveals how various are the qualifications needed to equip the successful dealer in real estate . The realty history of the city in general and of particular neighborhoods ; the law of leasing , managing , appraising , condemning , insuring , selling , and building ; the tact for administration ; the diplomacy of commerce ; no less than character , personality , and imagination are all required . Not only the practitioner , as well as the owner and investor , can obtain serviceable suggestions from this symposium ; but the economist also will profit by its perusal . The subject of land in theoretical economics is too imperiously dominated by certain broad and rigid generalizations , such as the assumed limitation of the land supply , the automatic increase of its rent , its comparative freedom from commercial risk , and its supposed coign of vantage as regards the other factors of production . All of these hypotheses are rudely jostled by the testimony of men who make real estate dealing their profession . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invade the forsaken territory , there is often " an actual drop in the value of property so replaced by wholesale establishments " ( p. 202 ) . The agent , it is now universally admitted , seeks the tenant ; not the tenant the agent , as formerly . The trade is evidently as plastic , as mast other commercial enterprises ; and land and its improvements are seen to be quite akin to the other instrumentalities of production . The closet economist 's ideas about land remind one of what Emerson says of the young citizen 's illusion about society : It lies before him in rigid repose , with certain names , men , and institutions , rooted like oak trees to the centre , round which they all arrange themselves as best they can But the old statesman knows that society is fluid ; there are no such roots ' and centres , but any particle may suddenly become the centre of the movement , and compel the system to gyrate round it .
