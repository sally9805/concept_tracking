txt The Net Spread for Belgium . I am in receipt from the German information Service of a copy of the document entitled " The Case of Belgium . " and desire to make the following comment : If Mr. A , Immediately after holding an hour 's conference with Mr. goes away and tells Mr. C ? that he has not seen Mr. B for a month and has no Idea of ills whereabouts , the action , although untruthful , may he sensible . because Mr. A may succeed in producing some desired effect upon the mind of Mr. C. But if . While Messrs . A. B , and C are all together and engaged in open conversation . Mr. A tells Mr. C that Mr. B is not present and that - he does not know Stir whereabouts the action is foolish , as well as untruthful. because in no circumstances will Mr. ' t ' believe ' Mr. A 's statement . Such , it seems to me . Is the German Position in presenting the ' ' case " against Belgium . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sensible enough to regard Germany as devoid of honor and her agreement as worthless , and that they felt themselves compelled to provide against her perfidy . " Surely , in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird . "  - -  Proverbs i .. 17.
