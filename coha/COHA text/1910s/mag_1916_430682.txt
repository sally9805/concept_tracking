WHEREVER the early explorers and colonists approached the shores of America , from the sandy beaches of Florida to the rockbound coast of New England , they were greeted with the sweet fragrance of flowers and shrubs and trees . Barlow , one of the commanders of Raleigh 's expedition , wrote of that landing : " We smelt so sweet and strong a smell , as if we had been in the midst of some delicate garden . The woods were not such as we find in Europe , barren and fruitless , but the highest and reddest cedars , pines , cypresses , and many others of excellent quality . Of grapes we found such a plenty climbing over every shrub and tree and down to the very water 's edge , I think in all the world there is not the like in abundance . " Similar accounts of the New World were sent from every point the wanderers touched ? a verdant , blooming land indeed ! As the wilderness was cleared before the encroaching settlements , fruit and vegetables were planted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stock the larder and to earn a livelihood , left  | the colonists no time for the cultivation of purely ornamental flowers . But it is more than probable that many of the earliest gardens harbored a slip or tender seedling of some cherished bloom that wives and daughters brought with their household goods , to remind them of their old homes beyond the sea . As living became easier , more time could be devoted to the cultivation of flowers . HERB AND KITCHEN GARDENS The intolerant religion of the Puritans forbade the indulgence of joy and gaiety in gardens , as in all things else . Orchards , small fruit and vegetable gardens were planted , and the herb garden near the kitchen was the especial care of housewives . But a garden wherein nothing grew that was not useful might at the same time boast many lovely flowers . On the earliest lists of sweet and bitter herbs for the stew-pot and the medicine-chest were thyme , pennyroyal , marjoram , anise , marigold , feverfew , coriander , rosemary , rue and lavender . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afforded a wealth of fragrant bloom and delightful color . The oldest gardens , therefore , must have been very pleasant plots indeed . There was little plan to them . The plants were generally grown on each side of a straight walk . EARLY FLOWER GARDENS After a time the bit of ground before the house , which was set back from the street within a picket fence , was taken in charge by the housewife and spaded and raked and planted with flowers valued solely for  | their beauty and rarity . Occasionally along some village street we still find traces of these old front door-yards . They were the " company " gardens , planted for show , trim , dignified little beds of flowers behind their stiff box-wood edgings , and damp in the shade of the heavy elm , or cedar , that guarded the entrance . The little square plots , divided with geometrical precision , bordered the entrance walk or displayed neat patterns beneath the windows . Here grew lilies-of-the-valley , blue and yellow flags , pinks and periwinkles , larkspur and tulips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white , or purple , lilac nodded over the fence ; and the strawberry shrub and the snow-ball bush adorned the corners . When the struggle of pioneer days was over and an era of wealth and affluence followed , people began to beautify their homes and surroundings . Part of the land near the house was reserved for pleasure-grounds and was enclosed with high fences . There was no pretence at elaborate design in the planting of the flowers ; but occasionally we find old gardens where box-bordered beds in squares , or circles , are-placed on each side of the central path . Of flowers and shrubs there was great variety . Against the white fence the stately hollyhock nodded its bloom to greet the bright phlox ; and the blue larkspur made pleasant harmony against a border of spicy Scotch pinks , foxgloves , Sweet Williams , Canterbury Bells , wallflowers , rockets , candy-tuft , Crown Imperial , and the beloved oldtime " Piny " ( peony ) . Frequently , a gravel-path , bordered on either side by box , led to a summer house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer house the broad-leaved Dutchman 's Pipe , clambered to mingle with the pink moss rose and the delicate white and yellow  | Scotch roses . The latter , lasting after many other flowers had ceased to bloom , seemed like a dash of golden sunshine in the fading colors of the garden . The summer house was usually a simple little building of latticework ; but , sometimes , it was more substantial and elaborately decorated and carved . Here the fair hostess and her friends used to come on summer afternoons to rest and chat over a cup of tea and look out upon the beauties of the garden . In the designs of many of these old New England gardens Dutch influence is evident . It is hard to tell whether it came through England in the days when that country was copying the ideas of Holland , or whether it was brought directly from New Amsterdam . Dutch taste demanded regular , even divisions of the ground into squares and circles , squares within the squares , and squares about a circle , oblongs and ovals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or wood , or iron-work . The flower-beds were neat , precise and orderly . Each variety of flower was usually grown in a bed by itself and kept exact and neat within the border . GARDENS IN THE SOUTHERN COLONIES In the Southern Colonies there was a different type of garden . The Southern colonists were , generally speaking , men of rank and wealth , sons of gentlemen and lords ; and they lived , not in towns and villages , but on great plantations . There were few cottages with tiny gardens . NIanor houses and park-like enclosures appeared in the earliest days . The pleasure-grounds were fashioned somewhat after the Elizabethan style which prevailed when the Colonists left England , and , as a rule , they were planned by the architect who designed the house . Thus house and garden were parts of an elaborate design , balancing each other in harmony . If the house was square , or oblong , the garden enclosure followed the lines  | of the house . Terraces and broad steps led from one level to the next ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right angles , divided the grounds into rectangular plots . These spaces were filled with grass , or box-bordered " knots " and mazes . The terraces , supported by grass banks or low walls , afforded pleasant promenades from which to view the whole . Shaded walks , and walks between high and neatly clipped hedges passed through " green galleries " and bowers . Some of these bowers were merely rude supports for training vines ; others were pergolas of white posts and cross beams that formed an archway sometimes twenty feet wide and a hundred long . QUAKER GARDENS The gardens of the Quakers in Pennsylvania had an individuality of their own . Towns were laid out so . that each house might have ample room for a garden ; and it was required that the garden should be placed in the center of the lot so the effect of the whole might be that of a green park . In front of the houses double rows and avenues of trees were planted to follow the line of the long , low buildings . Behind them were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of the most beautiful gardens of the New World were planted in these broad , peaceful estates of the Quakers . Old-fashioned flowers and shrubs grew in profusion , carefully confined within their borders and trained to obey their mistress 's will . SHOW GARDENS OF BOSTON It is a long leap from the little beds of transplanted wild flowers  | that thrived beside the log cabins of the Massachusetts settlers , to the gorgeous peristyled gardens of the Twentieth Century that adorn the North Shore today . One of the first accounts of early American gardens was given in 1672 by John Josselyn , who made a study of New England flowers and plants . These first gardens consisted , as we have seen , of simple little beds laid out in woodland clearings close by the simple houses . Here flowers from the woods became acquainted , and seeds and plants that had been brought from England . Even in the early days of the country 's history there were a few rich homes . The Governors of all the colonies lived well and , doubtless , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country prospered , rich homes and gardens increased . By the middle of the eighteenth century showplaces abounded in New England , particularly in Massachusetts , the parent State . Boston , of course , was famed for its gardens . That of the Hancock Mansion is often quoted . It was a carefully tended garden . Tulips , hollyhocks , jessamine besides curious plants beautified the place . But the Hancock , like many of the other fine gardens of Boston , is no longer in existence . FAMOUS SALEM GARDENS The old-fashioned garden of New England reached its highest development in Salem , Massachusetts . John Endicott , the first  | governor of the colony , has been termed the pioneer of garden culture in New England . On his extensive grounds ( now in Danvers ) he planted the daisy imported from England known today as the white weed , and the Dyer 's weed , or Woad Waxen . The latter spread and flourished until it became a menace to the farmer , covering the hillside with brilliant yellow flowers . When General Gage took up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now known as " The Lindens , " there was a beautiful garden at the rear . This was reached through a one path walk , which ended in a summerhouse at the farther end . This garden within the last few years has been restored to its original design , and is today bright with many descendants of the same flowers that were there when General Gage enjoyed it . A hundred years ago , Joseph Cabot laid out at the rear of his house , built in 1748 , one of Salem 's most wonderful gardens . He imported from Holland thousands of bulbs . During the tulip season it was visited by hundreds of persons . This became a festive time in the historic town . In all New England there was never a more beautiful display than the thousands of tulips that were in blossom here in the Spring . The old Saltonstall garden hidden behind a high wall , as were most of the Salem gardens , is reached through an archway covered with vines . It still retains the old time box borders . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands midway down the garden path . Here grow wonderful peonies , many of which are the original plants . The design of the Hoffman garden , which was laid out in the early part of the nineteenth century , has been kept by the present mistress , who loves the flowers no less than the first owners who planted them . In the garden the first camelias were grown , one of the plants being still alive and showing every season an abundance of bloom . There were gorgeous specimens of the New Holland acacia and the smilax which has grown for the first time in New England . Joseph Peabody , whose vessels at one time circumnavigated the globe , bought an estate in Danvers about 1812 . In front of the house his son ,  | Francis Peabody , laid out a charming garden , for which he designed a unique summer-house . Just beyond is another famous garden ? that of Elias Haskett Derby . The Derby garden was one of the most famous in New England . It was noted for its rare fruits and flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature in those days . Many rare bulbs and plants were imported . Here blossomed the first night-blooming cereus , the Cereus Grandifloris , not the flat leaved cactus commonly called by that name . This garden was formal in its arrangement . One of the summerhouses , the work of McIntyre of Salem , is particularly beautiful . A singular feature of this garden was a thatched hermitage concealed beneath a weeping willow . Within , a pallet of straw , some broken furniture and the life-sized effigy of a man appearing to read from a prayer-book afforded a surprise to the visitor . Another famous Salem Garden was laid out in 1822 by Robert Manning , one of the most enterprising and successful fruit cultivators in America . Hawthorne loved to come here and wander up and down the box-bordered paths , drawing inspirations for many a story from the trees and flowers . The orchard contained two thousand fruit trees . GARDENS OF NEWBURY One of the horticulturists who did much to improve Salem gardens was George Huessler , a German , who had served his apprenticeship in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done in Newburyport for John Tracy , who had a fine residence on High Street . A feature of this garden is its flagging of large irregular stones , now moss grown , which form a court-yard just back of the house . The box-bordered posy beds are filled with the same kind of flowers that were planted when the garden was first laid out . The grounds were laid out in terraces . Many  | of the flowers were cultivated in hot beds that covered part of the grounds . Baron de Talleyrand speaks of it in his second volume of travel . More famous is the garden at Indian Hill , West Newbury . The estate on which this garden is situated was the last tract of land conveyed by the Indians to the town of Newbury . This was assigned by the Indian called " Great Tom " in 165o , and since that time it has been occupied by the Poore family . This garden was laid out in terraces , and it was originally known as the " White Garden , " for nothing was allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particular fondness for white , and cultivated , as well as white flowers , a flock of white pigeons , a flock of white sheep , and a herd of white cattle . In this garden grew the white candytuft used for edging , the narcissus , the snowflake , and the Star of Bethlehem . The deutzia and spiraeas also flourished . Today we find there all the old-fashioned flowers popular a century ago . The same gardener laid out the Moulton gardens in Newbury . NEW HAMPSHIRE GARDENS Portsmouth , New Hampshire , has always been celebrated for its gardens . The Ladds , the Sherburnes , the Wendells , the Wentworths and other families took pride and pleasure in their flowers . The garden of the Barrett-Wendell house , built in 1798 , belongs to a later period than the mansion ; but , though not " Colonial , " is still " old-fashioned " and quaint . Martha Hilton , the little serving-maid , who married Governor Bennington Wentworth in the old Wentworth house at Portsmouth , NewHampshire , doubtless loved the garden that belonged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same kinds of flowers  | that grew in the gardens of the Colonial days . Here cinnamon pinks were a feature of the border . Behind them bloomed masses of bachelor buttons , four o'clocks , poppies , and Sweet William . Under the trees , ferns , lilies-ofthe-valley , and rockeries , filled with wild flowers transplanted from the woods , beautified the shady place . Another famous New Hampshire garden was the one planted by Sir Henry Franklin for Agnes Surriage at Hopkinton . Tradition says the first lilacs known to New England were seen here . Records of many flowers imported , among them daffodils and tulips , show how people of that day loved to cultivate flowers . Like Martha Hilton , Agnes Surriage began life as a servant and captivated the fancy of a wealthy gentleman of fashion . Unfortunately , this garden is now only a memory . TOPIARIAN GARDENS At the close of the seventeenth century tree-sculpture became the fashion in England . Trees and shrubs were cut into all kinds of grotesque shapes according to the whims of the topiary , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in American gardens of the period , particularly in the Southern States , where box was chiefly used . A good example of this style of gardening is exhibited at Wellesley by Mr. Hunnewell , who conceived an idea many years ago of laying out his estate as an Italian garden in which topiary effects would be the charm . The gleaming marble steps make a fine contrast with the green of the trees . " It was after a visit to Elvaston , nearly fifty years ago , " Mr. Hunnewell writes , " that I  | conceived the idea of making a collection of trees for topiary work , in imitation of what I had witnessed at that celebrated estate . As suitable trees for that purpose could not be obtained at the nurseries in this country , and as the English yew is not reliable in our New England climate , I was obliged to make the best selection possible from such trees as had proved hardy here ? the pines , spruces , hemlocks , junipers , arborvitae , cedars and Japanese retinosporas . The trees were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth was shortened twice annually , causing them to take a close and compact habit , comparing favorably in that respect with the yew . Many of them are now more than forty feet in height and sixty feet in circumference , the hemlocks especially , proving successful . " This , of course , is not an old garden but it is interesting enough to be considered in this article . Everyone loves a garden . An old writer remarks : " There is not one of woman born without a sense of pleasure when he sees buds bursting into leaf ; earth yielding green shoots from germs in its warm bosom ; white fruit blossoms tinted with rose blushes , standing out in clumps from slender branches ; flowers courting the look by their varied loveliness and smell ; large , juicy apples bowing down the shoots from which they spring ; plants of giant growth with multiform shrubs beyond ; and hollyhocks towering like painted pinnacles from hidden shrines.
