I commence my journal , my dear Elizabeth , with a description of the pain I felt at taking leave of all my friends , or shall I leave you to imagine ? The afternoon has been spent by me. in the most painful reflections , and in almost total silence by my companions . I have thought of a thousand things unsaid , a thousand kindnesses unpaid with thanks that I ought to have remembered more seasonably , and the neglect of which causes me many uneasy feelings . My neglecting to take leave of Sally , has had the same effect ? I hope she did not feel hurt by it , for it proceeded from no want of gratitude for her kindness to me . I did not imagine parting with any friend could be so distressing as I found leaving your ' Mama . I did not know , till then , how much I loved her , and could I at that moment have retraced my steps ! but it was too late to repent . Deacon Wolcott and his wife are very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very pleasant companion ; I do not know what I should do without her . We came on to Butler 's this afternoon , and I came immediately down to Uncle Pond 's and drank tea . Miss W. camewith me and both Uncle and Aunt invited her to stay and sleep with me , which she accordingly did . Cousin Patty has been with me , to say goodbye to all my friends , and to-morrow we proceed to Stamford . Sat . night . D. Nash 's Inn , MIDDLESEX . We had a cold , unsociable ride today , each one of us being occupied in thinking of the friends we had left behind and of the distance , which was every moment increasing , between them and us . We stopt to eat oats at a Tavern in Fairfield , West Farms ; an old Lady came into the room where Miss W. ( whose name , by the way , is Susan , not Hannah , Sally , or Abby ) and we were sitting . Well ! gals where are you going ? ' To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Connecticut ? Why , what a long journey ! do yot ) ever expect to get there ? How far is it ? " Near 600 miles . ' Well , gals , ? you gals and your husbands with you ? ' No , ma'am . ' Not got your husbands ! Well , I do n't know ? they say there 's wild Indians there ! ' The poor woman was then call 'd out to her daughter ( the mistress of the house ) , who she told us has been ill five months with a swelling , and she 341 had come that afternoon to see it launch 'd by the physicians who were then in the house . She went out , but soon return 'd and told us they were cutting her poor child all to pieces . ' She did not know but she should as lieve see a wild Indian as to see that scene over again . I felt very sorry for the poor old Lady ? I could not help smiling at the comparison . The country we pass thro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not describe to you , nor indeed could I ; for I am attended by a very unpleasant tho ' not uncommon , companion , ? one to whom I have bow 'd in subjection ever since I left you , ? Pride . It has entirely prevented my seeing the country , lest I should be known . You will cry ' For shame , ' and so did I , but it did no good : I could neither shame nor reason it away , and so I suppose it will attend me to the mountains ; then I am sure it will bid me adieu ; for you know the proverb , Pride dwelleth not among the mountains . ' I do n't certainly know where this proverb is to be found , but Julia can tell you ? for , if I mistake not , it is on the next page to ' There is nothing sweet , ' etc . I do not find it so unpleasant riding in a waggon as I expected , nor am I very much fatigued with it ; but four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of . October 25 , Monday Cook 's inn , COUNTY WESTCHESTER . I never will go to New Connecticut with a Deacon again , for we put up at every bye-place in the country , to save expence . It is very grating to my pride to go into a tavern and furnish and cook my own provision ? to ride in a waggon , etc. , etc. , ? but that I can possibly get along with ; but to be oblig 'd to pass the night in such a place as we are now in , just because it is a little cheaper , is more than I am willing to do ; I should even rather drink clear rum out of the wooden bottle after the deacon has drank and wip 'd it over with his hand , than to stay here another night . The house is very small and very dirty ? it serves for a tavern , a store , and I should imagine , hog 's pen , stable , and everything else . The air is so impure I have scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The landlady is a fat , dirty , ugly-looking creature , yet I must confess very obliging . She has a very suspicious countenance and I am very afraid of her . She seems to be master , as well as mistress and storekeeper , and from the great noise she has been making directly under me for this half hour , I suspect she has been stoning the raisins and watering the rum . ' All the evening there has been a storefull of noisy drunken fellows , yet Mr. Wolcott could not be persuaded to bring in but a small part of the baggage , and has left it in the waggon before the door , as handy as possible . Miss W 's trunk is in the bar-room unlock 'd , the key being broken to-day . It contains a bag of money of her father 's , yet she could not persuade him to bring it upstairs . I feel so uneasy I can not sleep and had therefore rather write than not this hour . Some one has just gone below stairs after being as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what purpose I know not , unless to go to our trunks or waggon . The old woman ( for it was her who went down ) tells me I must put out my candle , so good-night . Tuesday morn . I went to bed last night with fear and trembling , and feel truly glad to wake up and find myself alive and well ; if our property is all safe , we shall have double cause to be thankful . The old woman kept walking about after I was in bed , and I then heard her in close confab with her husband a long time . Our room is just large enough to contain a bed , a chair , and a very small stand ; our bed has one brown sheet and one pillow . The sheet however appear 'd to be clean , which was more than we got at Nash 's : there we were all oblig 'd to sleep in the same room without curtains or any other screen , and our sheets there were so dirty I felt afraid to sleep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first arrival there ; but before we left them , they appear 'd quite to like us , and I do n't know why they should not , for we were all very clever , notwithstanding we rode in a waggon . Mrs Nash said she should reckon o n't to see us again ( Miss W. and me ) , so I told her that in 3 years she might expect to see me . She said I should never come back alone , that I would certainly be married in a little while ; but I am now more than ever determin 'd not to oblige myself to spend my days there by marrying , should I even have an opport'y . I am oblig 'd to write every way , so you must not wonder at the badness of the writing ? I am now in bed and writing in my lap . Susan has gone to see if our baggage is in order . I hear the old woman 's voice talking to the good deacon , and an ' I beg your pardon ' comes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear to see her again , she is such a disgusting object . The men have been swearing and laughing in the store under me this hour , and the air of my room is so intolerable , that I must quit my writing to go in search of some that is breathable . Having a few moments more to spare before we set out , with my book still in my lap , I hasten to tell you we found everything perfectly safe , and I believe I wrong 'd them all by suspicions . The house by daylight looks worse than ever ? every kind of thing in the room where they live ; a chicken half piek 'd hangs over the door , and pots , kettles , dirty dishes , potatoe bar- rels , and every thing else ; ? and the old woman , ? it is beyond my power to describe her , ? but she and her husband are both very kind and obliging ; it is as much as a body 's life is worth to go near them . The air has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if I had taken an emetic , and should I stay till night I certainly should be oblig 'd to take to my bed , and that would be certain death . I did not think I could eat in the house , but I did not dare refuse ; the good deacon nor his wife did not mind it , so I thought I must not . The old creature sits by eating , and we are just going , to my great joy ; so good-bye , good-bye till to-night . Tuesday Noon Ferry House , near State Prison . It has been very cold and dusty riding to-day . We have met with no adventure yet , of any kind . We are now waiting at the ferry house to cross the river as soon as wind and tide serve . The white waves foam terribly ; how we shall get across I know not , but I am in great fear . If we drown , there will be an end of my journal . SPRINGFIELD , NEW JERSEY Pierson 's Inn ; Wed'y P.M. 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no body 's ' ; for instance , it is nobody 's business where we are going , yet every body enquires ? every toll-gatherer and child that sees us . I am almost discouraged ? we shall never get to New Connecticut or anywhere else , at the rate we go on . We went but eleven miles yesterday and 15 to-day . Our waggon wants repairing , and we were oblig 'd to put up for the night at about 3 oclock . I think the country so far much pleasanter than any part of Connecticut we pass 'd thro ' , but the Turnpike roads are not half as good . The Deacon and his family complain most bitterly of the gates and toll bridges , tho ' the former is very goodnatur 'd with his complaints . Also the tavern expenses are a great trouble . As I said before I will never go with a Deacon again , for we go so slow and so cheap , that I am almost tir 'd to death . The horses walk , walk , hour after hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive till some of us ask when we shall get there . Then he remembers the longer we are on the road the more expensive it will be , and whips up his horses ; and when Erastus , the son , drives , we go still slower for fear of hurting the horses . Since I left I have conceived such an aversion for Doctors , and the words expense , expensive , cheap , and expect , that I do not desire ever to see the one ( at least to need them ) , or hear the others again , in my life . I have the greater part of the time , till now , felt in better spirits than I expected ? my journal has been of use to me in that respect . I did not know but I should meet with the same fate that a cousin of Mr Hall 's did , who like me , was journeying to a new , if not a western country : she was married on her way and prevented from proceeding to her journey 's end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where we stopt to eat , not oats but gingerbread , who enquired , or rather expected we were going to the ' Hio . We told him yes , and he at once concluded it was to get husbands . He said winter was coming on and he wanted a wife and believ 'd he must go there to get him one . I concluded of course the next thing would be a proposal to Miss W. or me , to stay behind to save trouble for us both ; but nothing would suit him but a rich widow , so our hopes were soon at an end . Disappointment is the lot of man , and we may as well bear them with a good grace ? this thought restrain 'd my tears at that time , but has not been able to , since . What shall I do ? My companions say they shall insist upon seeing my journal , and I certainly will not show it to them , so I told them I would bring it with me the first time I came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to them ; but I shall do my utmost to send it to you before I go ? that would be a sufficient excuse for not performing my promise , which must be conditional . BUNSFIELD , N. J. Sat . mom October 57 . We yesterday travell 'd the worst road you can imagine ? over mountains and thro ' vallies . We have not , I believe , had N rods of level ground the whole day , and the road some part of it so intolerably bad on every account , so rocky and so gullied , as to be almost impassable. 15 miles this side Morristown we cross 'd a mountain call 'd Schyler , or something like it . We walk 'd up it , and Mrs W. told us it was a little like some of the mountains , only not half so bad ; indeed , every difficulty we meet with is compar 'd to something worse that we have yet to expect . We found a house built in the heart of the mountain near some springs , in a romantic place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not know , but I suspect they are , and that the house is built for the accommodation of those who go to them ; for no human creature , I am sure , would wish to lice there . Opposite the house are stairs on the side of the mountain and a small house resembling a bathing house , at the head of them . At last the road seem 'd to end in a hog 's pen , but we found it possible to get round it , and once more found ourselves right again . We met very few people , yet the road seem 'd to have been a great deal travelled . One young man came along and caus 'd us some diversion , for he eyed us very closely and then enter 'd into conversation with Mr W. , who was walking a little ahead . He told him he should himself set out next week for Pittsburg , and we expect to see him again before we get there . Erastus enquir 'd the road of him , and he said we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd on till we put up for the night ; he walking his horse all the way and looking bark at the waggon . As soon as we came to the inn , he sat on his horse at the door till he saw us all quietly seated in the house and then rode off . Which of us made a conquest I know not , but I am sure one of us did . We have pass 'd thro ' but 2 towns in N. J. , but several small villages ? Dutch valley , between some high hills and the mountain ; Batestown , where we stopt to bait ; and some others , all too small to deserve a name . At last we stopt at Mansfield , at an inn kept by Philip fits ( a little D. We found it kept by 2 young women , whom I thought amazons , for they swore and flew about ' like witches . ' They talk 'd and laugh 'd about their sparks , etc. , etc. , till it made us laugh so as almost to affront @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BETELEILEM - HANOVER , Oct. 27 . Before I write you anything I will tell you where and how we are : ? we are at a Dutch tavern , almost crazy . In one corner of the room are a set of Dutchmen talking , singing , and laughing in Dutch , so loud that my brain is almost turn 'd ; they one moment catch up a fiddle , and I expect soon to be pull 'd up to dance . I am so afraid of them I dare hardly stay in the house one night ; much less over the Sabbath . I can not write , so good-night . Sunday eve ; sundown . I ran wait no longer to write you , for I have a great deal to say . I should not have thought it possible to pass a Sabbath in our country among such a dissolute vicious set of wretches as we are now among . I believe at least 50 Dutchmen have been here to-day to smoke , drink , swear , pitch cents , almost dance , laugh and talk Dutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ droves , young and old , black and white , women and children . They are all high Dutch , but I hope not a true specimen of the Pennsylvanians generally . Just as we set down to tea , in came a dozen or two of women , each with a child in her arms , and stood round the room . I did not know but they had come in a body to claim me as one of their kin , for they all resemble me ; but as they said nothing to me , I concluded they came to see us Yankees , as they would a learned pig . The women dress in striped linsey-woolsey petticoats and short gowns not 6 inches in length ; they look very strangely . The men dress much better ? they put on their best clothes on Sunday , which I suppose is their only holiday , and ' keep it up ' as they call it . A stage came on from Bethlehem and stopt here , with 2 girls and a welldress 'd fellow who sat between them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next town to a dance or a frolic of some kind , for the driver , who was very familiar with them , said he felt just right for a frolic . I suspect more liquor has been sold to-day than all the week besides . The children have been calling us Yankees ( which is the only English word they can speak ) , all day long . Whether it was meant as a term of derision or not , I neither know nor care . Of this I am sure , they can not feel more contempt for me than I do for them ; tho ' I most sincerely pity their ignorance and folly . There seems to be no hope of their improvement as they will not attend to any means . After saying so much about the peo- ple , I will describe our yesterday 's ride ? but first I will describe our last night 's lodging . Susan and me ask 'd to go to bed , and Mrs W. spoke to Mr Riker the landlord ( for no woman was visible ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we ask 'd Mrs W. to go up with us , for we did not dare go alone . When we got into a room , he went to the bed and open 'd it for us , while we were almost dying with laughter , and then stood waiting with the candle for us to get into bed . But Mrs W. , as soon as she could speak , told him she would wait and bring down the candle , and he then left us . I never laugh 'd so heartily in . my life . Our bed to sleep on was straw , and then a feather-bed for covering . The pillows contain 'd nearly a single handful of feathers , and were cover 'd with the most curious and dirty patchwork I ever saw . We had one bedquilt and one sheet . I did not undress at all , for I expected Dutchmen in every moment , and you may suppose slept very comfortably in that expectation . Mr and Mrs W. and another woman slept in the same room . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open 'd her bed also . After we were all in bed , in the middle of the night , I was awaken 'd by the entrance of three Dutchmen , who were in search of a bed . I was almost frighten 'd to death , but Mr W. at length heard and stopt them before they had quite reach 'd our bed . Before we were dress 'd the men were at the door , which could not fasten , ? looking at us . I think wild Indians will be less terrible to me , than these creatures . Nothing vexes me more than to see them set and look at us and talk in Dutch and laugh . Now for our ride . ? After we left Mansfield , we cross 'd the longest hills , and the worst road , I ever saw : two or three times after riding a little distance on a turnpike , we found it fenced across and were oblig 'd to turn into a wood where it was almost impossible to proceed ? large trees were across , not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could possibly ride . It appear 'd to me , we had come to an end of the habitable part of the globe ; but all these difficulties were at last surmounted , and we reach 'd the Delaware . The river , where it is cross 'd , is much smaller than I suppos 'd . The bridge over it is elegant , I think . It is covered and has 16 windows each side . As soon as we pass 'd the bridge , we enter 'd Easton , the first town in Pennsylvania . Wednesday , Oerber 31 . HIGHDLEBURG , PENN . We pass 'd through Reading yesterday , which is one of the largest and prettiest towns I have seen . We stopt about 2 hours in the town , and I improved my time in walking about to see it . I went into the stores enquiring for a scissor-case . Almost every one could talk English , but I believe the greatest part of them were Dutch people . As soon as we left Reading , we cross 'd the Schuylkill . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thro ' it in our waggon . A bridge was begun over it , but the man broke and was unable to finish it . I was extremely tir 'd when we stopt , and went immediately to bed after tea , and for the first time for a long while , undress 'd me and had a comfortable nights rest . We are oblig 'd to sleep every and any way at most of the inns now . My companions were all disturbed by the waggoners who put up here , and were all night in the room below us , eating , drinking , talking , laughing , and swearing . Poor Mr W. was so disturb 'd that he is not well this morning , and what is more unpleasant to us , is not good natur 'd , and Mrs W. has been urging him this half hour to eat some breakfast . He would only answer , ' I sha n't eat any , ' but at length swallow 'd some in sullen silence , but is in a different way preparing to ride . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended a gentle emetic , or some such thing , to see how he would bear being sick a little , for I could not coax a husband as I would a child , only because he was a little sick and a great deal cross . I trust I shall never have the trial ? I am sure I should never bear it with temper and patience . Mr W. is I believe , . a very pious good man , but not naturally pleasant-temper 'd ; religion , however , has corrected it in a great degree , but not wholly overcome it . Airs W. is an amiable sweet-tempeed woman as I ever saw ; the more I know her , the better I love her . Susan is a charming girl , but Erastus is rather an obstinate boy ; he feels superiour to his father and every one else , in wisdom . Mrs Jackson is a clever woman , I believe , but I have a prejudice against her which I can not overcome . She is very inquisitive and very communicative . She resembles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her looks . She has considerable property and feels it very sensibly . Her youngest son is almost eighteen and has his wife with him , who is not quite as old . They have been married 2 months , and are a most loving couple . I can not help thinking whenever I see them together , of ' Love I Sophia ? ' etc . Her name is Eliza and his , John . The other son is a very obliging but not a very polish 'd young man . I like them all better than at first . Friday morn . I have been very much diverted at hearing some part of our landlady 's history , which she told last night , after drinking a little too much , I suppose . She says she has property if she is not married ; ? she had her fortune told a short time since , and was told to think of a certain gentleman living about 300 miles off , which she did , and thought so hard that a drop of blood fell from her nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd how far she was going ; being told about 300 miles ? well , she said , she really believ 'd her oldest son was the young man she was to have , for he looks just like the one she thought of . The young man- will be flatter 'd no doubt . Sunday eve ; EAST PENSHOW 'S TOWNSHIP , P ? . We left Mr Rees ' yesterday ten o'clock , and after waiting some time at the ferry house , cross 'd the Susquehanna with considerable difficulty . The river is a mile wide and so shallow that the boat would scrape across the large stones so as almost to prevent it from proceeding . We only came 8 miles ; the riding was awful , and the weather so cold that I thought I should perish riding 4 miles . This will do well for us ? 8 miles in 3 days . We put up for the Sabbath at a tavern where none but the servants deign to look at us . When I am with such people , my proud spirit rises and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard is paid to the Sabbath any where in this State : it is only made a holiday of . So much swearing as I have heard amongst the Pennsylvanians both men and women I have never before heard during my whole life . I feel afraid I shall become so accustom 'd to hearing it , as to feel no uneasiness at it . Harrisburgh is a most dissipated place , I am sure , and the small towns seem to partake of the vice and dissipation of the great ones . I believe Mrs Jackson has cast her eyes on Susan or me for a daughter-in-law ; for my part , though I feel very well-disposed towards the young man , I had not thought of making a bargain with him ; but I have jolted off most of my high notions , and perhaps I may be willing to descend from a judge to a blacksmith . I shall not absolutely determine with respect to him till I get to Warren and have time to look about me and compare him with the judges Dobson and Stephenson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's bow . But , in spite of my prejudices , they are very clever . Among my list of cast offs I would rank Dutchmen , a Pennsylvania waggoner , ditto gentlemen . Tuesday night , Nov. 6 . We have only counted 17 miles today , although the riding has been much better than for several days past . We stopt in Shippenburgh at noon . The town contains only one street a mile and a half in length and very thickly built . The street is some part of it pleasant , and some part dirty . I saw in it a handsome young gentleman who was both a Dutchman and Pennsylvanian , yet in an hour and a half I did not hear him make use of a single oath or prophane word . It was a remarkable instance , the only one I have known , and I could not but remark it . We are 4 miles from Strasburgh and the mountains , and one of our horses is ill , owing to Erastus giving him too many oats . Erastus is master rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all any one . He is a stubborn fellow , and so impudent to his mother and sister , that I have no patience with him . We are not as bless 'd as the Israelites were , for our shoes wax old and our cloathes wear out . I do n't know that mine will last till I get there . Saturday morn Nov. 9 . I am now in despair : it continues raining faster than ever . The house full of drunken prophane wretches , the old woman cross as a witch . We have nothing to eat and can get nothing but some slapjacks at a baker 's some distance off , and so stormy we can not get there . Mrs Jackson frets all the time . I wish they would go on and leave us , we should do as well again . Mr Beach and his wife and child and the woman who is with them , are here , and the house is full . It rains most dreadfully and they say it is the clearing-off shower . Oh , if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a dove , how soon would I meet you again ! ' We have never found the wretches indelicate till last evening , but while we were at tea , they began talking and singing in a most dreadful manner . We are 4 miles from Sidling hill , the next mountain ; and a mile and a half from this there is a creek which we must cross , that is so rais 'd by the rain , as to render it impossible to pass it . Saturday night . Our clearing-up shower ' has lasted all day with unabated violence . Just at sunset we had a pretty hard thunder shower , and at dusk there was clear sky visible and the evening star shone bright as possible , but now it is raining fast again . After giving an emetic , I would take a long journey with my intended , to try his patience ; mine is try 'd sorely now . I wish you could just take a peep at me ? my frock is wet and dirty a quarter of a yard high , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my chamber almost the whole day , but was oblig 'd to go down just at night to eat , and look at the sky . I was very much frighten 'd by a drunken waggoner , who came up to me as I stood by the door waiting for a candle ; he put his arm round my neck , and said something which I was too frighten 'd to hear . It is the first time the least insult has been offer 'd to any of us . One waggoner very civilly offer 'd to take Susan or me on to Pitts'g in his wagon , if we were not like to get there till spring . It is not yet cetermin 'd which shall go with him . One waggon in crossing the creek this afternoon , t urn 'd over and very much injur 'd . I 'Ve have concluded the reason so few are willing to return from the Western country , is not that the country is so good , but because the journey is so bad . Mr W. has gone to and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the last time . Poor Susan groans and sighs , and now and then sheds a few tears . I think I exceed her in patience and fortitude . Mrs Wolcott is a woman of the most perfect equanimity I ever saw . She is a woman of great feeling and tenderness , but has the most perfect command over her feelings . She is not own mother to these children , but she is a very good one . I have learn 'd Elizabeth to cat raw pork and drink whisky ; do n't you think I shall do for a new country ? I shall not know how to do either when I end my journey , however . We have almost got out of the land of Dutchmen , but the waggoners are worse . The people here talk curiously ; they all reckon instead of expect . Tuesday eve , Nov. 13. 4 miles east of BEDFORD , PENN . We rode some distance on its the Juniata 's banks , and had the road been tolerable , it would have been pleasant . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will hardly believe me when I tell you we saw some of the worst to-day we have ever found , and some as good as any in this state . I should not have suppos 'd it possible for any thing to pass it . Mrs W. said it seem 'd like going into the lower regions , but I had always an idea that road was smooth and easy . I am sure if it was as bad as that , it would have fewer travellers . We went down , however , till we came to a lower region . It was really awful . We saw some men to-day mending the roads ; I did not think a Pennsylvanian ever touch 'd a road or made a bridge , for we are oblig 'd to ride thro ' every stream we come to . We have been nearly 20 miles to-day , and have been oblig 'd to walk up hill , till we are all very tir 'd . I felt too much so to write , but I am unwilling to omit it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have left ; but that we can not do . Friday night , ALLEGANY M'T'N . After a comfortable night 's rest , we set out on foot to reach the height of the mountain . It rain 'd fast for a long time , and at length began snowing . We found the roads bad past description , ? worse than you can possibly imagine : large stones and deep mud-holes every step of the way . We were oblig 'd to walk as much as we possibly could , as the horses could scarcely stir the waggon the mud was so deep and the stones so large . It has grown so cold that I fear we shall all perish to-morrow . We suffer 'd with cold excessively to-day . From what I have seen and heard , I think the State of Ohio will be well fill 'd before winter . Waggons without number every day go on . One went on containing forty people . We almost every day see them with 18 or 20 ; one stopt here to night with 21 . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill 'd with movers and waggoners . It is a comfortable place , but rather small . One old man has been in examining my writing , and giving his opinion of it in Dutch , to a young fellow who was with him . He said he could not read a word of any thing . He found fault with the ink , but commended the straitness and facility with which I wrote , ? in English . I was glad he had not on his specs . We came but 10 miles to-day , and are yet on the Alleghany . It is up hill almost all the way down the mountains . I do not know when we are down them for my part . I 'm thinking , as they say here , we shall be oblig 'd to winter on it , for I reckon we shall be unable to proceed on our journey , on account of roads , weather , etc . Saturday eye , Miles from LAUREL HILL , PENN . We came but 9 or 10 miles to-day , and are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with half-drunken noisy waggoners . One of them lies singing directly before the fire ; proposing just now to call for a song from the young ladies . I can neither think nor write he makes so much noise with his love songs ; I am every moment expecting something dreadful and dare not lay down my pen lest they should think me listening to them . They are the very worst wretches that ever liv 'd , I do believe ? I am out of all patience with them . The whole world , nor any thing in it , would tempt me to stay in this state three months ? I dislike everything belonging to it . I am not so foolish as to suppose there are no better people in it than those we have seen ; but let them be ever so good , I never desire to see any of them . We overtook an old waggoner whose waggon had got set in the mud , and I never heard a creature swear so ; and whipt his horses till I thought they would die . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Almighty , whose awful name was so blasphem 'd . We also overtook a young Doctor , who is going with his father to Mad River in the state of Ohio . He has been studying physic in New Jersey , but appears to be an uneducated man from the language he makes use of . I believe both himself and his father are very clever . I heard them reproving a swearer . He dresses smart , and was so polite as to assist us in getting over the mud . Susan and I walk 'd on before the waggon as usual , and he overtook us and invited us into the house and call 'd for some brandy sling ; we did not drink , which he appear 'd not to like very well , and has scarcely spoken to us since . He thinks himself a gentleman of the first chop , and takes the liberty of coining words for himself . Speaking of the people in this state , he said they were very ignorant and superstitionary : perhaps you have heard the word before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west of the mountains . Rejoice with me , my dear Elizabeth , that we are at length over all the mountains , so call 'd . I do not suppose we shall be much better off than we were before , as it respects roads , ? for I had just as Hove go over a mountain , as to go over the same distance of any part of the road we have had this fortnight or three weeks . But it sounds well to say we are over the mountains . Nov. 23 ; Friday morn . TURTLE CREEK , PENN . One misfortune follows another , and I fear we shall never reach our journey 's end . Yesterday we came about 3 miles . After coming down an awful hill , we were oblig 'd to cross a creek ; but before we quite came to it , the horses got mired , and we expected every moment one of them would die ; but Erastus held his head out of water , while Mr W. was attempting to unharness them , and Mrs W. and Susan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat by , to see the horse breathe his last ; but was happily disappointed in my expectation . No assistance could be got , till Mr W. waded through the water , and then 2 men with 3 horses came over . We came to this inn , and Mr W. thought it best to stay till this morning . All our company have gone on . Mr Smith invited me to ride with his wife , to Pittsburgh , and I , on some accounts , wish I had accepted his invitation ? indeed I could scarcely get beside it . We found a gentleman ( Doctor , I presume by his looks ) here , who was very sociable and staid an hour with us . He appear 'd to be a man of good information and considerable politeness . We found the landlord very goodnatur 'd and obliging , and his wife directly the contrary . We find the men , generally , much more so than their wives . We are N miles from Pittsburgh , and here like to be . The landlord offers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old folks go on . We got into the Slough of Despond yesterday , and are now at the foot of the Hill Difficulty ? which is half a mile long ; one waggon is already fast in the mud on it , and Mr W. is afraid to attempt it himself . I think I will winter here . Nov. 24 ; Saturday night , 33 miles beyond PITTSBURG . Just as we were getting into the waggon this morning , Mr W. found he had left his great coat 4 miles back , and went back on foot after it , while we proceeded to Pittsburg , which we reach 'd about noon . Mr W. came about an hour after . After getting well warm , Susan and I were going out to view the town , when Mr W. came and hurried us away , as he wished to cross the river before night . From the little we did see of the town , I was extremely disappointed at its appearance . It is not one half as large as I suppos 'd ; but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my own observation . It is situated at the confluence of the 2 rivers , the Alleghany and Monongahela . The town suffer 'd very much by the flood : one house floated down the river ; its inhabitants were in the upper part of it calling for assistance ; none could be render 'd and what became of them I did not learn : I believe it is not known . Wednesday Nov. 48. 7 miles from GREENSBURG , PENN . I have had no opport'y of writing you for 3 days before now . We set out in the rain on Monday , and came on 13 miles ? to a but with a sign up call 'd a tavern ; and such a place ! I found the people belong 'd to a very ancient and noble family . They were first and second cousins to his Satanic Majesty . I could not but wonder that he should suffer them to lead so laborious a life , for they are among his most faithful friends and subjects . Probably they are more useful to him in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their dwelling resembles that of their royal cousin , for it is very dark and gloomy and only lighted by a great fire . No one who is once caught in it , ever wishes to be again . The man is only related by marriage to his lordship . Wednesday eve . The house had only one room in it . There was a number of travellers and we got but one bed ? that was straw or something harder . The pillow case had been on 5 or 6 years , I reckon , so I pin 'd over my hankerchief , and put my night-gown over my frock . We rose an hour before daybreak , got breakfast , and set out in the snow for another hut . We came 101 miles today , and are at a very comfortable inn , just in the edge of Greersburg . We expected to get a little further , to Hart 's tavern quite in the town ; and there I hop 'd to see Judge Austin again , and I determin 'd at any rate to accept his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on with him , for I do not intend to walk 9 miles a day till we get there , if I can help it ? even if it will not hurt me . I wo n't take the good deacon 's word for that . The horses are really tir 'd out and out , and every day by the time we get 4 miles they will stop , and it is extremely difficult to get them on at all ; but it is so expensive hiring a horse to go on , that as long as the waggon alone can be drawn 3 or 4 miles a day , it will not be done ; but I feel provoked , as you will easily see , so I will write no more on this subject . I am so anxious to end my journey , that I have lost all interest about the country I pass through . It snows or rains every day , constantly . I think in good weather the ride from Warren to Pitts'g must be pleasant . If that were at present the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my journey would be pleasanter . ? Thursday eve . 10 miles as usual , has been our day 's ride . I have not walk 'd my 9 miles , but I walk 'd as much as I could . We are in a comfortable house before an excellent fire . It is snowing very fast . Saturday , p.m . ? WARREN ! After so long a time Friday morning we set out early , with the hope of getting to Youngstown at night and to Warren to-night , but 4 miles from Youngstown the horses were so tir 'd they would not stir , so we stopt at a private house for the night , an hour before sundown . We had been in the house but a little time , when Susan look 'd out and told me she thought there was some one after me , and I soon saw Mr Edwards and 2 horses . I was never so happy , I think . ' I ran out to meet him . He came in and set a while , and just at dark we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going with us , so she rode behind him , and I rode the single horse . We reach 'd Cousin Joseph Woodbridge 's about the middle of the eve . They got us a good supper and gave us a bed . Mrs W. is a very pretty woman ( I mean pleasing ) . They have 3 children , and appear to be very well of ( you understand me ) , and happy . They live in a very comfortable log. house , pleasantly situated . A cousin in this country is not to be slighted , I assure you . I would give more for one in this country than for N in old Connecticut . This morning Mrs Todd came over to see us , and urg 'd us to stay and spend the day with her . But spite of her solicitations , we set out for Warren soon after breakfast . My horse was extremely dull and we did not get here till near e oclock . Cousin Louisa was as happy to see me as I could wish , and I think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasanter than I expected , the house better , and the children as fine . Cousin has alter 'd very little , in any way . I found a Mrs Waldo here just going to Connecticut , and lest I should not have another opport'y , I intend sending this by them , without even time to read it over and correct it . I am asham 'd of it , my dear Elizabeth , and were it not for my promise to you , I do n't know that I should dare to send it . I will write your Mama by mail , I have not time for a letter now . My very best love to everybody . I have a great deal more to say , but no more time than just to tell you , I am ever and most affect'ly Yours , M V D ? . Let no one see this but your own family . ( A little over a year after her arrival in Warren Miss Dwight was married to William Bell , Jr. , a wholesale merchant of Pittsburg . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a large family of children , entertaining many friends ; and the family tradition is that she was active and very vivacious.
