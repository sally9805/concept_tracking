Jacobsen 's " Marie Grubbe , " BjOrnson 's " Arnliot Gelline , " and an " Anthology of Swedish Lyrics . " ENRI BARBUSSE 'S " Le Feu , " upon which we coml. mented in our issue of October 11 , has been translated into English with the title " Under Fire , " by Fitzwater Wray and is published by Dutton at $1.50 net . DERTRAND RUSSELL 'S " Political Ideals " ( The Cen- tury Co. ; $1 ) will doubtless be read with anticipation by many persons who sympathize with the author 's pacifist views , as well as by others who , more or less violently opposed to pacifism in any form , are curious to see what new heresies so well-known a pacifist has been able to invent . Both classes of readers will be disappointed . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's admirably written pages , but they are quite incidental to a searching and destructive criticism of civilized society as now constituted and administered , and to an exposition of a new social order towards which every enlightened state ought , in Mr. Russell 's opinion , to aspire . Briefly , the new regime for which Mr. Russell pleads appears to be a mixture , in somewhat uncertain proportions , of theoretical anarchism and a sort of guild socialism . The ownership of property , and in general the whole theory of possession , is a fatal bar to individual development and independence , and leads straight to the domination of a property-holding class , the intrenchment of governmental authority , and ultimately to war . Not in trade unionism , nor syndicalism , nor socialism is a satisfactory remedy to be found , mainly because all such devices and palliatives represent , in the last analysis , only a substitution of one kind of force for another . Precisely what the features of the new society should be is not very clear from Mr. Russell 's intimations , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part to be found in a limited control vested in the workers in each particular industry . Beyond this , the author would seem to favor a virtually complete liberty for the individual in personal conduct as well as in economic and political relations ; the functions of government , which he would by no means abolish , being restrained to the preservation of such liberty and resistance to arbitrary violations of it . As nationality tends to the enhancement as well as to the conservation of possessory rights , the peace of the world will be best insured by the creation of an international state . Mr. Russell 's keen dissection of the evils of modern industrialism and the obstacles to free thought is at least wholesomely disturbing , but we can not discover in his vague constructive suggestions any well-thought-out plan that can be adjudged practically workable . ATIIERINE TYNAN ( Hinkson ) , the Irish poet , novel- ist , and journalist , has made of her cheery reminiscences of the years 1891 to 1911 a good-sized book which she calls " The Middle Years " ( Houghton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of books , has contributed to numberless periodicals , and has corresponded with count --  less literary persons of more or less importance . Her record conveys the impression that she has been delightfully busy , tirelessly interested , and exuberantly happy . Her prime gifts , which richly flavor the volume , are her Celtic blood , her quick warm sympathies , her affection for almost all kinds of men and women and all kinds of flowers and pets . She has the caressing touch which wins the love of dogs and young poets  --  old poets , too , for that matter . Describing her dog Paudeen , she says : " In the midst of the Perivale fields , where there is or was a wicket-gate , one day a whole girls ' school  --  darling , fat , peach-skinned little girls with shining locks  --  knelt down and worshipped him . " There is the quality of emotion that a literary coterie values . " You know how to praise ! " writes Mr. Yeats . " What a good untiring friend you are ! " Another secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admits that it is not in her " to write with difficulty , " even in a perfect hurly-burly of noise and confusion . In favorable circumstances she has been capable of producing two novels between the 6th of May and the 20th of July  --  one of them " good , " the other " not at all bad . " She writes her reminiscences , one suspects , just as she talks  --  without much premeditation , composition , or revision , but with an unflagging gush of high spirits , a full memory , and a chaotic diary . This voluble chatter illuminates nothing steadily and adequately but the swirling mental furniture of one Irishwoman of letters , in the midst of which one catches many a glimpse of notable autographs , letters , photographs , and souvenirs . THE author adored Parnell and the Fenian leader , John O'Leary , and she conveys a sense of those deep personal loyalties which play so large a part in Irish politics and reinforce the cement of race and religion . She worshipped with other young pencraftsmen at the feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. B. Yeats in the days when that high priest of the Celtic Renaissance was still musing on his mission , and she makes two chapters of his letters to her . She gives piquant glimpses of Francis Thompson , Lionel Johnson , and the Meynells , with whom she was in sympathetic relationship . George Moore she did not care for ; nor did she go far with Mr. G. B. Shaw . Her acquaintance with George Wyndham she notes characteristically as " one of the most golden happenings of my life . " Here and there among the slight sketches and personal gossip and anecdote is something of genuine literary interest . For example , this from one of Yeats 's letters : " In the second part of Oisin ' under disguise of symbolism I have said several things to which I only have the key . The romance is for my readers . They must not even know there is a symbol anywhere . They will not find out . If they did it would spoil the art . " This is a delicate art , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin law-giver 's soul . Among the golden sayings of Francis Thompson this is not the least memorable and pregnant : " I despise the conventional modesty of these days , and see no reason why a poet should pretend to see no merit in his own verse , . when in his heart he believes it to be good . When I find a poet doing so , I always exclaim internally : ' What the deuce did you publish it for then ? ' " THE brief description of the Water Service of the Swiss Department of the Interior , in the Annales de Geographic for September , strongly emphasizes the need of a similar service in many of our States . In Switzerland each stream is carefully surveyed and reports are published showing the amount of water carried by them , the area of their ponds and reservoirs , and the use made of them , as well as the erosion caused , and the consequences of the correction of their courses . Especial consideration is given to what is termed the new science of fluvial hydraulics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects treated in this number are the largest Mediterranean lake , Berre , of which a careful study has been made , the resources of fish , seaweed , and lime of the west coast of France , the regions bordering on the Sea of Marmora , and facts showing the gradual desiccation of Senegal . ccip ELUSION and Dream , " an interpretation in the light of psychoanalysis of " Gradiva , " a novel by William Jensen , is an essay of some hundred and twenty pages by Dr. Sigmund Freud , of Vienna , scientific interpreter of dreams and healer of souls ( Moffat , Yard ; $2 ) . It is translated into English by Helen M. Downey and published in one volume with a version of Jensen 's novelette by the same translator , whose competency and conscientiousness are expertly vouched for in an introduction by Dr. G. Stanley Hall , whose artistic competency , however ( the conscientiousness seems evident ) is illustrated in the opening pages of the novelette by such passages as " a tall , slight figure , whose soft , wavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 ) , and " a foreboding of it reached the senses and awoke in remote , sunny places a desire for leaf-green , fragrance and bird-song " ( 15 ) . " Gradiva , " a typical product of Teutonic sentimentalism , is the story of a young archmologist of Berlin who has fallen in love with the antiaue bas-relief of a girl with a peculiarly graceful walk ( hence the name , " Gradiva " ) . After dreaming that he had seen her in Pompeii at the time of its destruction in the year 79 , he seemingly meets the same young woman in Pompeii itself , and the delusion which links the two experiences in one order of things persists until he learns from her that she is his neighbor in Berlin and a playmate of his childhood  --  after which the usual happy ending . Freud treats the story as an interesting and remarkable confirmation , because without scientific intent ? " out of the mouths of babes , " so to speak  --  of his theory of dreams . The author is more clear-headed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And to the prosaic view of unscientific common-sense it would seem that the dreams embodied in the novelette have no more verisimilitude than the usual dreams of fiction or the " brain fever " employed by novelists of a past generation . Freud 's essay , which , by the way , adds nothing to his theory of dreams , reminds one of the German professor 's grave corrections , on the margin , of the errors in German in Mark Twain 's speech . Truly it is an interesting theory which is as well supported by fiction as by fact , and the possibilities of confirmation would seem to be unlimited . Next , doubtless , we shall have a study of the " repressions " which kept the sleeping beauty from waking for a century and an analysis of the erotic motives underlying the noble stoicism of the little tin soldier . UNDER the title " The Folk-Element in Hindu Culture " ( Longmans , Green ; $5 net ) the well-known Hindu scholar , B. K. Sarkar , has made a valuable contribution to our knowledge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle Ages and of the present time . His book of over three hundred pages , of which fifty are devoted to classified indices , might perhaps have been called preferably Hindu Culture in Folk-Religion . It shows how modern religious cults are drawn from a mixture of older culture-forms , indistinguishably mingled , a hodge-podge of Buddhism , Shivaism , and popular rites . History is rather vague to the author ( as is often the case in India ) . He believes that the " analogues and duplicates " of the modern Gambhira festivity in Bengal " crossed the limits of Asia and became established in Europe and Africa . " This festivity , as its name implies , is a dramatic performance based on the worship of a deity worshipped in the inner recess or temple of Shiva , a spring-festival originally , in which drama is employed to castigate those deserving of ridicule as well as to worship the god or goddess ( female form of Shiva ) . It retains the swing-rite , in which worshippers swing with the sun , their backs being pierced with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those devout souls who do not wish to become one with the divine and lose personality : " We want to be become ghosts and enjoy ourselves hereafter . " It is interesting to find that Dharma ( as in China ) has become a goddess ; that Mohammed has become a god ; and that virtuosity led the poets of the Middle Ages to give the prize of poetry to the poem containing the most unintelligible words . The whole volume is full of such odd bits of information together with an illuminating general survey of popular festivals in Bengal . Some inductions are questionable , but the work is to be commended if only for the mass of first-hand material here collected . WRITTEN for a British rather than an American public , David Hannay 's " Diaz " ( Holt ; $2 net ) inspires the confidence born of frank disinterestedness . It makes no pretence at being exhaustive . This is doubly fortunate in the case at hand , since an attempt to plunge too far into the details of Mexican politics for the last half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recrimination , of fulsome praise and abuse , of that impassioned defence and fervent invective of which the contemporary Latin-American historian is both the sponsor and the victim . Mr. Hannay has , in fact , treated his interesting hero with a suitably light touch . He neither eulogizes nor condemns him . He presents facts of population and political development with the insight and sympathy of one who is thoroughly familiar with the winning as well as the repellent side of Spanish-America . Thus he frames Diaz in a Mexican frame , and not , as too many authors are inclined to do , in an American or European frame . Mr. Hannay estimates Diaz as an excellent ruler , but only a moderate statesman . At the same time he doubts whether Mexico can ever hope to produce a better statesman . In other words , through the shortcomings of Diaz he perceives the real measure of the civilization he directed for many important years . BEFORE Mr. Hannay had finished his volume , Diaz was 1. ) dead and Mexico was again plunged into anarchy . This alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the dictator 's life . To many it was not apparent , even so late as 1909 , that Diaz had wrought no permanent change in Mexico . The semblance of order prevailed . The treasury frequently showed a surplus . Mexico 's credit stood high , and it was obviously to the interest ofthose with large financial interests in the country , which they wished to promote , to strengthen in every way the legend that Diaz had accomplished a miracle and established permanent order in Mexico . Perhaps the eighty-year-old dictator himself knew better . It is inconceivable that selfishness should so far have mastered him that he would refuse to make way for another unless he understood Mexico better than his extravagant admirers . He knew that the " Diaz system " would pass out with Diaz . And he was resolved that it should not pass out until every last ounce of his strength failed him . He stuck to that resolve . When he finally gave up the reins , it was rather through the insidious advance of senile decay than through the force of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the importance of the United States in Mexican politics , yet those familiar with Mexican affairs would say that he does not stress it enough . Diaz faced more than one internal crisis . It would be interesting to know just how often he mastered these crises by the simple expedient of threatening an American intervention . Where he could not count on the loyalty of his native Mexicans , he was for long able to count on their fear of the great republic to the north . The phantom of American invasion was often worth more to Diaz than a brigade of infantry . He could unite all factions against an imaginary outside foe . It can at least be said of him that he left the material shell of Mexico better than he found it ; he left the country better known to foreign capital than ever it had been before . If he did not work an internal political miracle , we must measure the scant success of his efforts by comparison with the success of other Latin-American tyrants . Francia left Paraguay inert and inept . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European statesman brings the Balkans into a state of effective self government , our estimate of Diaz will fall correspondingly . IN " Victor Chapman 's Letters from France , " with a me- moir by his father , John Jay Chapman ( Macmillan ; U25 ) , we have the first fruits of what will soon be our American records of the great war . It is to such intimate records of service , graciously given to an appreciative public by their bereft sponsors , that the American historian must turn in the future to catch that elusive but necessary insight to the spirit and temper of a people at war in a just cause . The letters of this young aviator who gave his life for France , before his country had entered the war as her ally , are those of a healthy American boy who threw himself heart and soul into the great adventure . But there is - no missing the fact that all the fire and abandon of American youth , that so persistently robs these pages of their final tragedy , has followed upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is consistently backed by a full realization of the sacrifice and by a determination to pay the price . Thus it is a book that we should like to see in the hands of our youth of both sexes throughout the country .
