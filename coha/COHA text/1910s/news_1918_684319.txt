The meeting had not been extensively advertised , but an hour before it was called to order several hundred soldiers and bluejackets were in front of the hall begging the few policemen , then on duty , to let them into the hall . By 8 o'clock Fifty-eighth Street for half t block on either side of Palm Garden was packed with shouting and yelling soldiers and sailors and civilian e.arnpathizers . The leaders of the disturbers , for the crowd was well organ ? ized , issued instructions like General. ; in command , and one of them was to see to it that no person carr ? ing a re , .. Bag or wearing a red tie , or red rose , was to be permitted to enter the hall without first being deprived of the token .

American , " but there it stopped . They told him they wanted to get into that hall and that they intended to go In whether he wanted them to or not . ? " We like you all right , " Said one of the lenders , " but we want to land a few of those Bolshevist slachc , s ithe trouble makers , and what 's more , we expect to do it . " . uy U:30 o clock the battle outside the ball was in Suit Aogress . Time and time again the soldiers and sailors surged forward , each time to be stopped by we foot-to-foot formation of big policemen who blocked the entrance to the hail , and whose orders were to stand to the last man . " They must not pass , " said Inspector Morris , and , like the French at Verdun , the police held the line against all assaults . Inside the hall there was much excitement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be heard above the applause that followed every reference to Bolshevism and some of the cooler heads within were plainly apprehensive . At one time , a short while before 10 o'clock , the crowd almost got by the police , the doors were pushed half open , and a few of those in the advance guard , did get within . The noise outside swept into the hall in great volume and some of the people sought places of safety on stairs and in remote corners of the hall . It looked bad for the police , ! Alt a second load of reserves arrived in the nick of time , and once more Inspector Morris , who had been tossed about by the crowd , won the battle . The police had been reinforced by reserves from all the middle east side stations , and by hard pushing and much pdrsuasion  --  not a man used his club  --  the soldiers and sailors were forced back into the middle of the street and eventually to the north , side curb . There the police held , and the disturbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fifty-eighth Street was concerned : Accordingly they reformed their columns In Lexington Avenue . and before the police knew What was happening they had pounced upon five or six men , all but one of whom had been . in the Bolshevist meeting . One man , apparently a Russian , with long hair and poetic aspect , was handled in the roughest sort of fashion before the police rescued him . No sooner had they pulled hint away from the angry soldiers and sailors than a second group pounced on two more men whom they had settLleave the hall . They , too , were beaten and their eyes blackened before the police could effect a rescue . A fourth man received similar treatment , and then it was that the innocent man fell a victim to the excited youngsters in uniform . This man Was Walter Wright , a broker of 42 Broad Street . He was walking up Lexington Avenue with a young woman . As he neared Fifty-eighth Street Mr. Wright , seeing the crowd , went across and asked a sailor what the trouble was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Bolsheviks , a great big one , too , " shouted the sailor to Whom Mr. Wright had addressed his inquiry . A moment later a score of men pounced upon the broker . Mr. Wright Is a big , athletic man , but the odds were too great , and he was ? quickly beaten to his knees . They ripped off his tie , tore his topcoat , and blackened an eye before the police could take him from the mob . He was nearly unconscious when rescued . The provost guard , which was summoned after 9 o'clock , arrived on the scene about that time . The guard was a detachment of fifteen men , under command of Lieutenant J. 0 . Gannon and Sergeant John Fredericks . They all wore their flaming red brassards with the letters " P. G. " The guards lost no time getting Into action and soon two soldiers , said to be among the ringleaders , were under arrest . Several hundred men tried to rescue the second soldier arrested , and then for the first time the clubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guards , and so quickly and effectively did they rap heads that the demonstration ended promptly . ' rile only woman who had an unpleasant experience had a little red flag in her hair . When a soldier shouted to her to remove it she obeyed without delay . At least a score of men left the hall without neckties . They had worn red ones . One woman wrapped her redline &; opera cloak in a newspaper and went out into the cold , street in bare shoulders to her automobile . Inside the hall there was much speaking and cheering . The man who spoke longest was introduced as A. Rhys Williams , a newspaper correspondent , and his speech indicated that he had only recently left the land of Lenin() and Trotsky . " In Russia , " he said , " I saw a picture of Abraham Lincoln , and on that Picture was written the word ' Bolshevik . ' " This drew great applause . He defended Bolshevism , and said that Russia was starving because the Allies had gone to the aid of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? to get wheat from Siberia . Bernard and Louis Goldstein , proprietors of Palm Garden , said last night that they had rented the hall to the Bolshevist sympathizers under the impression that it was to be a thoroughly loyal American meeting . " A young woman came to the hall last week in a big automobile , " said Bernard Goldstein , ' and rented the hall for the Woman 's International League . Had we noted then , as we do tonight , , 1 that she had short hair , we would have refused to rent the hall . However , she got a contract , and although we tried to get out of it , we were unable to do so . They came here Saturday and asked us to take down the three big American flags that recorate the hall and we told them nothing doing , and the flags are still there tonight . "
