txt // The question of affinities does not apply only to species ; for we have also to fix the general affinities of all the orders into which groups are united or divided from the comparative point of view . Affinities , although possessing very different values according to the importance of the parts exhibiting them , can none the less be extended to the conformation of the external parts . If the affinities are so great that not only the essential parts , but also the external parts present no determinable difference , then the objects in question are only individuals of the same species . If on the other hand , notwithstanding a large degree of affinity , the external parts exhibit appreciable differences , though less than the essential resemblances ; then the objects in question are different species of the same genus . The important study of affinities is not limited to a comparison of classes , families , or even of species ; it includes also a consideration of the parts of which individuals are composed . By comparison together of corresponding parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of individuals of the same race or the difference between individuals of distinct races . It has , in truth , been noted that the proportions and relations of the parts of all individuals composing a species or a race always remain the same , and so appear to be preserved forever . From this it has been rightly inferred that , by examining detached parts of an individual , one could decide to what species , old or new , these parts belong . This power is very favourable to the progress of knowledge at the present time . But the conclusions drawn from it can only hold good for a limited period ; since the races themselves undergo changes in their parts , in proportion to any considerable change in the circumstances which affect them . As a matter of fact , since these changes only take place with an extreme slowness , which makes them always imperceptible , the proportions and relations of the parts always appear the same to the observer , who does not really see them change . Hence , when he comes across any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the differences which he perceives have always existed . It is none the less quite true that by a comparison of corresponding parts in different individuals , their affinities , nearer or more remote , can be easily and certainly determined . It can therefore be known whether these parts belong to individuals of the same race or of different races . It is only the general inference that is unsound , having been drawn too hastily . This I shall have more than one opportunity of proving in the course of the present work . // Affinities are always incomplete when they apply only in an isolated case ; that is to say , when they are decided from an examination of a single part taken by itself . But , although incomplete , the value of affinities based upon a single part depends upon the extent to which the part from which they are taken is essential , and vice versa . There are then determinable differences among affinities , and various degrees of importance among the parts which display them ; in fact , the knowledge of affinities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important parts of living bodies had been distinguished from the less important , and unless a principle had been found for estimating the true values of these important parts . The most important parts for exhibiting the chief affinities are , among animals , the parts essential to the maintenance of life , and among plants , the parts essential to reproduction . In animals , therefore , it is always the internal organisation that will guide us in deciding the chief affinities . And in plants , it will be in the parts of fructification that affinities will be sought . But in both cases the parts most important for seeking out affinities vary . The only principle to be used for determining the importance of any part , without arbitrary assumptions , consists in enquiring either how much use nature makes of it , or else the importance to the animal of the function of that part . Among animals , whose affinities are mainly determined by their internal organisation , three kinds of special organs have rightly been chosen from among the others as the most suitable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order of importance , as follows : ( l ) The organ of feeling . The nerves which meet at a centre , either single as in animals with a brain , or multiple as in those with a ganglionic longitudinal cord . ( 2 ) The organ of respiration . The lungs , gills and tracheae. ( 3 ) The organ of circulation . The arteries and veins , which usually have a centre of action in the heart . The first two of these organs are more widely used by nature , and therefore more important than the third , that is to say , the organ of circulation ; for the latter disappears in the series after the crustaceans , while the two former extend to animals of the two classes which follow the crustaceans . Finally , of the two first , the organ of feeling has the more importance from the point of view of affinities , for it has produced the most exalt is I of animal faculties , and moreover without that organ muscular activity .. could not take place . If I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // alone are of importance in deciding affinities , I should set forth these parts in their order of importance as follows : ( 1 ) The embryo , its accessories ( cotyledons , perisperm ) and the seed which contains it . ( 2 ) The sexual parts of flowers , such as the pistil and stamens . ( 3 ) The envelopes of the sexual parts ; the corolla , calyx , etc. ( 4 ) The pericarp , or envelope of the seed . ( 5 ) The reproductive bodies which do not require fertilisation . These generally received principles give to natural science a coherence and solidity that it did not previously possess . Affinities are no longer at the mercy of changes of opinion ; our genera classifications become necessary inferences ; and according as we perfect them by this method they approach ever more closely to the actual order of nature . It was , in fact , due to the perception of the importance of affinities that the attempts of the last few years were originated to determine what is called the natural method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nature 's procedure in bringing her productions into existence . No importance is now attached in France to those artificial systems which ignore the natural affinities among objects ; for these systems give rise to divisions and classifications harmful to the progress of natural knowledge . With regard to animals , there is no longer any doubt that it is purely from their organisation that their natural affinities can be determined . It is , in consequence , chiefly from comparative anatomy that zoology will obtain the data for such determination . But we should pay more attention to the facts collected in the works of anatomists than to the inferences which they draw from them ; for too often they hold views which might mislead us and prevent us from grasping the laws and true plan of nature . It seems to be the case that whenever man observes any new fact he is always condemned to rush headlong into error in attempting to explain it ; so fertile is his imagination in the creation of ideas . He is not sufficiently careful to guide his judgment by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we consider the natural affinities between objects , and make a sound estimate of them , we can combine species on this principle , and associate groups with definite boundaries forming what are called genera . Genera can be similarly associated on the principle of affinities , and united into higher groups forming what are called families . These families , associated in the same way and on the same principle , make up orders . These again are the primary divisions of classes , while classes are the chief divisions of each kingdom . // We must then be guided everywhere by natural affinities in composing the groups which result by dividing each kingdom into classes , each class into orders , each order into sections or families , each family into genera , and each genus into different species if there is occasion for it . There is thorough justification for the belief that the complete series of beings making up a kingdom represents the actual order of nature , when it is classified with direct reference to affinities ; but , as I have already pointed out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in that series to help us to distinguish objects with greater ease do not belong to nature at all . They are truly artificial although they exhibit natural portions of the actual order instituted by nature . It should be added that in the animal kingdom , affinities should he decided mainly from a study of organisation . The principles employed for settling these affinities should not admit of the smallest doubt . We shall thus obtain a solid basis for zoological philosophy . It is known that every science must have its philosophy , and that it can not make real progress in any other way . It is in vain that naturalists fill their time in describing new species , in grasping all the shades and small details of their varieties , in enlarging the immense list of catalogued species , in establishing genera , and in making incessant changes in the principles which they use . If the philosophy of science is neglected her progress will be unreal , and the entire work will remain imperfect . it is indeed only since the attempt has been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature that natural science has obtained any coherence in its principles , and a philosophy to make it really a science . What progress towards perfection is made every day in our classifications since they were founded upon the study of affinities ! It was through the study of affinities that I recognised that infusorian animals could no longer be put in the same class as polyps ; that , radiarians also should not be confused with polyps ; and that eon , creatures , such as medusae and neighbouring genera , which Linnauis and even Bruguiere placed among the molluscs , were essentially allied to the echinoderms , and should form a special class with them . It was again the study of affinities which convinced me that worms were a separate group , comprising animals very different from radiarians , and still more from polyps ; that arachnids could no longer classed with insects , and that cirrhipedes were neither annelids nor molluscs . c // Finally , it was through the study of affinities that I succeeded in effecting a number of necessary alterations even in the classification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are closely allied to but distinct from the gastropods , should not be placed between the gastropods and the cephalapods , but between the acephalic molluscs and the gastropods ; since these pteropods , like all acephalic animals , have no eyes and are almost without a head , not even excepting Hyalea . ( V. the special classification of molluscs in Chap . VIII. , at the end of Part I. ) When the study of affinities among the different known families of plants has made us better acquainted with the rank held by each in the general series , then the classification of these living bodies will leave nothing more to arbitrary judgment , but will come more closely into conformity with the actual order of nature . The study of the affinities among observed objects is thus clearly so important that it should now be regarded as the chief instrument for the progress of natural science . CHAPTER III . OF SPECIES AMONG LIVING BODIES AND THE IDEA THAT WE SHOULD ATTACH TO THAT WORD . Ii ' is not a futile purpose to decide definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to enquire if it is true that species are of absolute constancy , as old as nature , and have all . existed from the beginning just as we see them to-day ; or if , as a result of changes in their environment , albeit extremely slow , they have not in course of time changed their characters and shape . The solution of this question is of importance not only for our knowledge of zoology and botany , but also for the history of the world . I shall show in one of the following chapters that every species has derived from the action of the environment in which it has long been placed the habits which we find in it . These habits have themselves influenced the parts of every individual in the species , to the extent of modifying those parts and bringing them into relation with the acquired habits . Let us first see what is meant by the name of species . Any collection of like individuals which were produced by others similar to themselves is called a species . This definition is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely those from which it sprang ; but to this definition added the allegation that the individuals composing a species never vary in their specific characters , and consequently that species have n solute constancy in nature . It is just this allegation that I propose to attack , since clear proofs draw n from observation show that it is ill-founded . The almost universally received belief is that living bodies Constitute species distinguished from one another by unchangeable characteristics , and that the existence of these species is as old as nature herself . This belief became established at a time when no sufficient observations had been taken , and when natural science // was still almost negligible . It is continually being discredited for those who have seen much , who have long watched nature , and who have consulted with profit the rich collections of our museums . Moreover , all those who are much occupied with the study of natural history , know that naturalists now find it extremely difficult to decide what objects should be regarded as species . They are in fact not aware that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the conditions in which are placed the individuals composing it ; nor that some of these individuals have varied , and constitute races which shade gradually into some other neighbouring species . Hence , naturalists come to arbitrary decisions about individuals observed in various countries and diverse conditions , sometimes calling them varieties and sometimes species . The work connected with the determination of species therefore becomes daily more defective , that is to say , more complicated and confused . It has indeed long been observed that collections of individuals exist which resemble one another in their organisation and in the sum total of their parts , and which have kept in the same condition from generation to generation , ever since they have been known . So much so that there seemed a justification for regarding any collection of like individuals as constituting so many invariable species . Now attention was not paid to the fact that the individuals of the species perpetuate themselves without variation only so long as the conditions of their existence do not vary in essential particulars . Since existing prejudices harmonise well with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined that every species is invariable and as old as nature , and that it was specially created by the Supreme Author of all existing things . Doubtless , nothing exists but by the will of the Sublime Author of all things , but can we set rules for him in the execution of his will , or fix the routine for him to observe ? Could not his infinite power create an order of things which gave existence successively to all that we see as well as to all that exists but that we do not see ? Assuredly , whatever his will may have been , the immensity of his power is always the same , and in whatever manner that supreme will may have asserted itself , nothing can diminish its grandeur . I shall then respect the decrees of that infinite wisdom and confine myself to the sphere of a pure observer of nature . If I succeed in unravelling anything in her methods , I shall say without fear of error that it has pleased the Author of nature to endow her with that faculty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quite simple , easy to understand , and seemed confirmed by the constancy in the // shapes of individuals , perpetuated by reproduction or generation . Such are a great number of these alleged species that we see every day . Meanwhile , the farther we advance in our knowledge of the various organised bodies which cover almost every part of the earth 's surface , the greater becomes our difficulty in determining what should be regarded as a species , and still more in finding the boundaries and distinctions of genera . According as the productions of nature are collected and our museums grow richer , we see nearly all the gaps filled up and the lines of demarcation effaced . We find ourselves reduced to an arbitrary decision which sometimes leads us to take the smallest differences of varieties and erect them into what we call species , and sometimes leads us to describe as a variety of some species slightly differing individuals which others regard as constituting a separate species . Let me repeat that the richer our collections grow , the more proofs do we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that noticeable differences disappear , and that nature usually leaves us nothing but minute , nay puerile , details on which to found our distinctions . How many genera there are both among animals and plants , among which the number of species referred to them is so great that the study and determination of these species are well nigh impracticable ! The species of these genera , arranged in series according to their natural affinities , exhibit such slight differences from those next them as to coalesce with them . These species merge more or less into one another , so that there is no means of stating the small differences that distinguish them . I t , is only those who have long and diligently studied the question of species , and who have examined rich collections , that are in a - position to know to what extent species among living bodies merge Into one another . And no one else can know that species only appear to he isolated , because others are lacking which are close to them but have not yet been collected . do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , regularaly graded throughout ; but I do mean that they form a branchseries , irregularly graded and free from discontinuity , or at least free from it . For it is alleged that there is now occasional distinuity , owing to some species having been lost . It follows that species terminating each branch of the general series are connected one side at least with other neighbouring species which merge into n . This I am now able to prove by means of well-known facts . require no hypothesis or supposition ; I call all observing taunts to witness . // Not only many genera but entire orders , and sometimes even classes , furnish instances of almost complete portions of the series which I have just indicated . When in these cases the species have been arranged in series , and are all properly placed according to their natural affinities , if you choose one , and then , jumping over several others , take another a little way off , these two species when compared will exhibit great differences . It is thus in the first instance that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay nearest to us . Generic and specific distinctions were then quite easy to establish ; but now that our collections are very rich , if you follow the above-mentioned series from the first species chosen to the second , which is very different from it , you reach it by slow gradations without having observed any noticeable distinctions . I ask , where is the experienced zoologist or botanist who is not convinced of the truth of what I state ? How great the difficulty now is of studying and satisfactorily deciding on species among that multitude of every kind of polyps , radiarians , worms , and especially insects , such as butterflies , Phalaena , Noctua , Tinea , flies , Ichneumon , Curculio , Cerambix , chafers , rosechafers , etc . ! These genera alone possess so many species which merge indefinably into one another . What a swarm of mollusc shells are furnished by every country and every sea , eluding our means of distinction and draining our resources . Consider again , fishes , reptiles , birds and even mammals ; you will see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species and even genera are separated by the finest differences , so that we have scarcely any foothold for setting up sound distinctions . Is there not an exactly similar state of ' affiairs in the case of botany , which deals with the other series , consisting of plants ? How great indeed are the difficulties of the study and determination of species in the genera Lichen , Fucus , Carex , Poa , Piper , Euphorbia , Erica , Hieracium , Solanum , Geranium , Mimosa , etc. , etc . When these genera were constituted only a small number of species belonging to them were known , and it was then easy to distinguish them ; but now that nearly all the gaps are filled , our specific differences are necessarily minute and usually inadequate . Let us see what are the causes which have given rise to this undoubted state of affairs ; let us see if nature affords any explanation , and whether observation can help us . We learn from a number of facts that , according as the individuals of one of our species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // of life , they become subject to influences which little by little alter the consistency and proportions of their parts , their shape , properties and even their organisation ; so that in course of time everything in them shares in these mutations . In the same climate , very different habitats and conditions at first merely cause variations in the individuals exposed to them ; but in course of time the continued change of habitat in the individuals of which I speak , living and reproducing in these new conditions , induces alterations in them which become more or less essential to their being ; thus , after a long succession of generations these individuals , originally belonging to one species , become at length transformed into a new species distinct from the first . Suppose , for example , that the seeds of a grass or any other plant that grows normally in a damp meadow , are somehow conveyed first to the slope of a neighbouring hill where the ground although higher is still rich enough to allow the plant to maintain its existence . Suppose that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it , reaches little by little the dry and almost barren ground of a mountain side . If the plant succeeds in living there and perpetuating itself for a number of generations , it will have become so altered that botanists who come across it will erect it into a separate species . The same thing happens in the case of animals that are forced by circumstances to change their climate , habits , and manner of life : but in their case more time is required to work any noticeable change than in the case of plants . The idea of bringing together under the name of species a collection of like individuals , which perpetuate themselves unchanged by reproduction and are as old as nature , involved the assumption that the individuals of one species could not unite in reproductive acts with individuals of a different species . Unfortunately , observation has proved and continues every day to ove that this assumption is unwarranted ; for the hybrids so common among plants , and the copulations so often noticed between animals of very different species , disclose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so impassable as had been Imagined . It . is true that often nothing results from these strange copulations , especially when the animals are very disparate ; and when anything does happen the resulting individuals are usually infertile ; but we also know that when there is less disparity these defects do not occur . Now this cause is by itself sufficient gradually to create varieties , which then become races , and in course of time constitute what , we call species . // To assist us to a judgment as to whether the idea of species has any real foundation , let us revert to the principles already set forth ; they show : ( 1 ) That all the organised bodies of our earth are true productions of nature , wrought successively throughout long periods of time . ( 2 ) That in her procedure , nature began and still begins by fashioning the simplest of organised bodies , and that it is these alone which she fashions immediately , that is to say , only the rudiments of organisation indicated in the term spontaneous generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animal and plant were fashioned in suitable places and conditions , the properties of a commencing life and established organic movement necessarily caused a gradual development of the organs , and in course of time produced diversity in them as in the limbs . ( 4 ) That the property of growth is inherent in every part of the organised body , from the earliest manifestations of life ; and then gave rise to different kinds of multiplication and reproduction , so that the increase of complexity of organisation , and of the shape and variety of the parts , has been preserved . ( 5 ) That with the help of time , of conditions that necessarily were favourable , of the changes successively undergone by every part of the earth 's surface , and , finally , of the power of new conditions and habits to modify the organs of living bodies , all those which now exist have imperceptibly been fashioned such as we see them . ( 6 ) That , finally , in this state of affairs every living body underwent greater or smaller changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we call species were imperceptibly fashioned among them one after another and have only a relative constancy , and are not as old as nature . But objections may be raised to the allegation that nature has little by little fashioned the various animals known to us by the aid of much time and an infinite variation of environment . It may be asked whether this allegation is not refuted by the single fact of the wonderful variety observed in the instinct of various animals , and in the marvellous skill of all kinds which they exhibit . Will anyone , it may be asked , venture to carry his love of system so far as to say that nature has created single-handed that astonishing diversity of powers , artifice , cunning , foresight , patience and skill , of which we find so many examples among animals ? Is not what we see in the single class of insects far more than enough to convince us that nature can not herself produce so many wonders ; and to compel the most obstinate philosopher to recognise that the will of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and could alone suffice for bringing into existence so many wonderful things ? // No doubt he would be a bold man , or rather a complete lunatic , who should propose to set limits to the power of the first Author of all things ; but for this very reason no one can venture to deny that this infinite power may have willed what nature herself shows us it has willed . This being so , if I find that nature herself works all the wonders just mentioned ; that she has created organisation , life and even feeling , that she has multiplied and diversified within unknown limits the organs and faculties of the organised bodies whose existence she subserves or propagates ; that by the sole instrumentality of needs , establishing and controlling habits , she has created in animals the fountain of all their acts and all their faculties , from the simplest to instinct , to skill , and finally to reason ; if I find all this , should I not recognise in this power of nature , that is to say in the order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Sublime Author , who was able to will that she should have this power ? Shall I admire the greatness of the power of this first cause of everything any the less if it has pleased him that things should be so , than if his will by separate acts had occupied itself and still continued t o occupy itself with the details of all the special creations , variations , developments , destructions and renewals , in short , with all the mutat ions which take place at large among existing things ? Now I hope to prove that nature possesses the necessary powers and faculties for producing herself that so much excite our wonder . The objection is still raised however that everything we see in living bodies indicates an unchangeable constancy in the preservation of t their form . It is held that all animals whose history has come down to us for two or three thousand years have always been the same , and neither lost nor acquired anything in the perfection of their organs and the shape of their parts . Not only had this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt has recently been made to find special proofs of it ' in a report on the natural history collections brought from Egypt by M. Geoffroy . The authors of the report express themselves as follows : " The collection has in the first place this peculiarity , that it may said to contain animals of all periods . It has long been asked whether species change their shape in the course of time . This question , apparently so futile , is none the less necessary for the history or t he world , and consequently for the solution of innumerable other questions which are not foreign to the gravest subjects of human worship . " We have never been in so good a position to settle this question , // in so far as concerns a large number of remarkable species and some thousands that are not remarkable . It appears as though the superstition of the ancient Egyptians were inspired by nature for the purpose of leaving a record of her history . " " It is impossible , " continue the authors of the report , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserved with its smallest bones and hair , perfectly recognisable , an animal which two or three thousand years ago had in Thebes or Memphis its priests and altars . But without giving rein to all the ideas suggested by this approach to antiquity , we shall confine ourselves to the announcement that this part of M. Geoffroy 's collection shows that these animals are exactly similar to those of to-day . " ( Annales du Museum d'Hist. natter. , vol. i. pp. 235 and 236 . ) I do not refuse to believe in the close resemblance of these animals with individuals of the same species living to-day . Thus , the birds that were worshipped and embalmed by the Egyptians two or three thousand years ago are still exactly like those which now live in that country . It would indeed be very odd if it were otherwise ; for the position and climate of Egypt are still very nearly what they were in those times . Now the birds which live there , being still in the same conditions as they were formerly , could not possibly have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is obvious that birds , since they can travel so easily and choose the places which suit , them , are less liable than many other animals to suffer from variations in local conditions , and hence less hindered in their habits . Indeed there is nothing in the observation now cited that is contrary to the principles which I have set forth on this subject ; or which proves that the animals concerned have existed in nature for all time ; it proves only that they inhabited Egypt two or three thousand years ago ; and every man who has any habit of reflection and at the same time of observing the monuments of nature 's antiquity will easily appreciate the import of a duration of two or three thousand years in comparison with it . Hence we may be sure that this appearance of stability of the things in nature will by the vulgar always be taken for reality ; because people in general judge everything with reference to themselves . For the man who forms his judgment only with reference to the changes that he himself perceives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear to him to be unlimited , on account of the shortness of the existence of individuals of his own species . // Moreover , we must remember that the records of his observations , and the notes of facts which he has been able to register , only extend back a few thousand years ; which is a time infinitely great with reference to himself , but very small with reference to the time occupied by the great changes occurring on the surface of the earth . Everything seems to him to be stable in the planet which he inhabits ; and he is led to repudiate the signs which exist everywhere in the monuments heaped up around him , or buried in the soil which he tramples underfoot . Magnitudes are relative both in space and time : let man take that truth to heart , and he will then be more reserved in his judgments on the stability which he attributes to the state of things that he observes in nature . ( See the Appendix , p. 141 , of my Recherches sur les corps vivants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the modifications which their individuals undergo according as they are forced to change their habits and contract new ones , we are not reduced to a mere consideration of the very short spaces of time comprised in our observations ; for , in addition to this induction , a number of facts collected many years ago throw enough light on the question to free it from doubt ; and I can now affirm that our observations are so far advanced that the solution sought for is patent . I ndeed not only do we know the results of anomalous fertilisations , but , we also now know positively that a compulsory and sustained alteration in the habitats and manner of life of animals works after a sufficient time a very remarkable mutation in the individuals exposed to it . Consider the animal which normally lives in freedom in plains where it habitually exerts itself by swift running ; or the bird which Is compelled by its needs to pass incessantly through large spaces the air . When they find themselves imprisoned , the one in the dens of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cages or back Is , they undergo in course of time striking alterations , especially r a succession of generations in their new state . The former loses a great part of his swiftness and agility ; his body thickens , the strength and subtleness of his limbs diminish , and his faculties are no longer the same ; the latter becomes heavy , can scarcely fly , and takes on more flesh in all his parts . In Chapter VI . of this Part I. , I shall have occasion to prove by I known facts the power of changes of conditions for giving to Wink new needs , and leading them on to new actions ; the power of new act ions when repeated to induce new habits and inclinations ; // finally , the power resulting from the more or less frequent use of any organ to modify that organ either by strengthening , developing and increasing it , or by weakening , reducing , attenuating it , and even making it disappear . With regard to plants , the same thing may be seen as a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of their parts ; so that we shall no longer be astonished to see the considerable changes that we have brought about in those that we have long cultivated . Thus , among living bodies , nature , as I have already said , definitely contains nothing but individuals which succeed one another by reproduction and spring from one another ; but the species among them have only a relative constancy and are only invariable temporarily . Nevertheless , to facilitate the study and knowledge of so many different bodies it is useful to give the name of species to any collection of like individuals perpetuated by reproduction without change , so long as their environment does not alter enough to cause variations in their habits , character and shape . OF THE SPECIES ALLEGED TO BE LOST . I am still doubtful whether the means adopted by nature to ensure the preservation of species or races have been so inadequate that entire races are now extinct or lost . Yet the fossil remains that we find buried in the soil in so many different places show us the remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and among which are found only a very small number of which we now know any living analogues exactly alike . Does this fact really furnish any grounds for inferring that the species which we find in the fossil state , and of which no living individual completely similar is known to us , no longer exist in nature ? There are many parts of the earth 's surface to which we have never penetrated , many others that men capable of observing have merely passed through , and many others again , like the various parts of the sea-bottom , in which we have few means of discovering the animals living there . The species that we do not know might well remain hidden in these various places . If there really are lost species , it can doubtless only be among the large animals which live on the dry parts of the earth ; where man exercises absolute sway , and has compassed the destruction of all the individuals of some species which he has not wished to preserve or domesticate . Hence arises the possibility that animals of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mastodon , of M. Cuvier , and some other species of genera previously known , // are no longer extant in nature : this however is nothing more than a possibility . But animals living in the waters , especially the sea waters , and in addition all the races of small sizes living on the surface of the earth and breathing air , are protected from the destruction of their species by man . Their multiplication is so rapid and their means of evading pursuit or traps are so great , that there is no likelihood of his being able to destroy the entire species of any of these animals . It is then only the large terrestrial animals that are liable to extermination by man . This extermination may actually have occurred ; but its existence is not yet completely proved . Nevertheless , among the fossil remains found of animals which existed in the past , there are a very large number belonging to animals of which no living and exactly similar analogue is known ; and among these the majority belong to molluscs with shells , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us . Now , if a quantity of these fossil shells exhibit differences which prevent us , in accordance with prevailing opinion , from regarding them as the representatives of similar species that we know , does it necessarily follow that these shells belong to species actually lost ? Why , moreover , should they be lost , since man can not have compassed their destruction ? May it not be possible on the other hand , that the fossils in question belonged to species still existing , but which have changed since that time and become converted into the similar species that we now actually find . The following consideration , and our observations throughout this work , will give much probability to such an assumption . Every qualified observer knows that nothing on the surface of the earth remains permanently in the same state . Everything in time undergoes various mutations , more or less rapid according to the nature of the objects and the conditions ; elevated ground is constantly being denuded by the combined action of the sun , rainstars and yet other causes ; everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of streams , of rivers , even of seas change in shale and depth , and shift imperceptibly ; in short , everything on the surface of the earth changes its situation , shape , nature and appearance , and even climates are not more stable . Now l shall endeavour to show that variations in the environment lure changes in the needs , habits and mode of life of living beings , and especially of animals ; and that these changes give rise to moditions or developments in their organs and the shape of their parts . this is so , it is difficult to deny that the shape or external characters every living body whatever must vary imperceptibly , although ! variation only becomes perceptible after a considerable time . // Let us then no longer be astonished that among the numerous fossils found in all the dry parts of the world , and constituting the remains of so many animals which formerly existed , there are so few of which we recognise the living representatives . What we should wonder at , on the contrary , is finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of which the still existing analogues are known to us . This fact , proved by our collections of fossils , suggests that the fossil remains of animals whose living analogues we know are the least ancient fossils . The species to which each of them belongs doubtless has not had time to undergo variation . Naturalists who did not perceive the changes undergone by most animals in course of time tried to explain the facts connected with fossils , as well as the commotions known to have occurred in different parts of the earth 's surface , by the supposition of a universal catastrophe which took place on our globe . They imagined that everything had been displaced by it , and that a great number of the species then existing had been destroyed . Unfortunately this facile method of explaining the operations of nature , when we can not see their causes , has no basis beyond the imagination which created it , and can not be supported by proof . Local catastrophes , it is true , such as those produced by earthquakes , volcanoes and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disorder ensuing from them . But why are we to assume without proof ' a universal catastrophe , when the better known procedure of nature suffices to account for all the facts which we can observe ? Consider on the one hand that in all nature 's works nothing is done abruptly , but that she acts everywhere slowly and by successive stages ; and on the other hand that the special or local causes of disorders , commotions , displacements , etc. , can account for everything that we observe on the surface of the earth , while still remaining subject to nature 's laws and general procedure . It will then be recognised that there is no necessity whatever to imagine that a universal catastrophe came to overthrow everything , and destroy a great part of nature 's own works . I have said enough on a subject which presents no difficulty . Let us now consider the general principles and essential characters of animals . CHAPTER IV . GENERAL PRINCIPLES CONCERNING ANIMALS . ANIMALS in general are living beings with very curious properties , well calculated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinitely varied in shape , organisation , and faculties , are capable of moving themselves or some of their parts without the impulse of any movement from without . Their irritability is due to an exciting rose which in some originates from within , while in others it comes entirely from without . Most of them possess the property of locomotion , and all have parts that are highly irritable . We find that in their movements some crawl , walk , run or leap ; others fly , rising into the atmosphere and passing through wide spaces ; hers again live in the waters and swim about there freely . Animals are not , like plants , able to find close by within their reach the material on which they feed ; and the predatory animals are actually obliged to go forth and to hunt , chase and seize their prey . It was necessary therefore that they should have the power of motion and even of locomotion , in order to procure the food which they require . Moreover , those among animals which multiply by sexual reproduction are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was farther necessary that they should be able to travel about for the purpose of effecting acts of fertilisation , and that the environment should provide facilities for it to those which , like oysters , can not change their position . Thus the needs of animals have endowed them with the property Ulf Wing parts of their bodies , and of carrying out locomotion which subserves their own survival and that of their races . In Part II . we shall enquire into the origin of this extraordinary faculty , as of the other important faculties found among them ; 1 it suffices at present to draw attention to certain obvious points // ( 1 ) Some only move themselves or their parts when their irritability has been stimulated ; but they experience no feeling : these are the most imperfect animals ; ( 2 ) Others , in addition to the movements that their parts can undergo through stimulated irritability are capable of experiencing sensations , and possess a very vague inner feeling of their existence ; but they only act by the internal impulse of an inclination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their will is always dependent and controlled ; ( 3 ) Others again not only exhibit in some of their parts movements resulting from their stimulated irritability ; not only are they capable of receiving sensations , and possess an inner feeling of their existence , but they have besides the faculty of forming ideas , although confused ones , and of acting by a free will , subject however to inclinations which lead them exclusively towards certain special objects ; ( 4 ) Finally , others ( and these are the most perfect ) possess in a high degree all the aforementioned faculties ; in addition they are able to form clear and precise ideas of the objects which affect their senses and attract their attention ; to compare and combine their ideas up to a certain point ; to form judgments and complex ideas ; in short to think , and to have a will that is less bound down and permits them to introduce more or less variation into their activities . Life in the roost imperfect animals has no energy of movement ; and irritability alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital energy increases in proportion to complexity of organisation , there arrives a time when nature has to improve her methods in order to provide for the necessary activity of vital movements ; for this purpose she has utilised muscular activity in establishing the circulatory system , so that the fluids can move with greater rapidity . This rapidity itself is increased in proportion to the increase of the muscular power which works it . Finally , since no muscular activity can take place without nervous influence , this has become everywhere necessary for the acceleration of the fluids in question . Thus nature has been able to add muscular activity and nervous influence to an irritability which was no longer adequate . But this nervous influence , which gives rise to muscular activity , never does so by means of feeling , as I hope to show in Part II . I shall then prove that sensibility is by no means necessary to the execution of vital movements , even in the most perfect animals . The various animals which exist are thus clearly distinguished from one another , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , size , etc. , but , in addition , by the faculties which they possess . Some , such as the most imperfect , are extremely limited // in that respect , having no other faculty but those of life in general , and being unable to move except by a power outside them ; while others have faculties , progressively more numerous and important , up to the most perfect animals , which exhibit a capacity calculated to excite our wonder . These remarkable facts no longer surprise us , when we recognise that every faculty is based upon some special organ or system of organs , and when we observe that organisation gradually becomes more complex as we pass from the most imperfect animal , which has no special organ whatever and consequently no faculty but those of life in general , to the most perfect and richly endowed animal . Thus all the organs , even the most important , arise one after the other in the animal scale , and afterwards become successively more perfect through the modifications impressed on them , by which these organs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are part . Hence , by their combination in the most perfect animals , they constitute the highest degree of organisation , giving rise to the most numerous and important faculties . The examination of the internal organisation of animals ; of the various systems presented by that organisation in the animal scale ; nd , finally , of the special organs , is then the subject of study most . serving of our attention . If animals , considered as productions of nature , are rendered extremely remarkable by their faculty of locomotion , a great many of an are still more so by their faculty of feeling . I have said that this faculty of locomotion is very limited in the most perfect animals , among which it is not voluntary and is only carried t by external stimuli . It then becomes gradually more perfect d ultimately takes its source within the animal itself , and becomes length subject to its will . In just the same way , the faculty of feeling still very obscure and limited in the animals among which it begins exist ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached its eat development it ultimately gives rise in the animal to the ( ties which constitute intelligence . Indeed the most perfect among animals have simple and even coinideas ; they have passions and memory and they dream , that is to say , t hey experience involuntary recurrences of their ideas and of t heir thoughts ; and they are up to a certain point capable learning . How wonderful is this result of the power of nature ! attire thus succeeds in endowing a living body with the faculty of locomotion , without the impulse of an external force ; of perceiving external to it ; of forming ideas by comparison of impressions received from one object with those received from others ; of D // comparing or combining these ideas , and of forming judgments which are merely ideas of another order ; in short , of thinking . Not only is this the greatest marvel that the power of nature has attained , but it is besides a proof of the lapse of a considerable time ; since nature has done nothing but by slow degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as great in our ordinary calculations , an enormous time and wide variation in successive conditions must doubtless have been required to enable nature to bring the organisation of animals to that degree of complexity and development in which we see it at its perfection . If an inspection of the numerous diverse strata composing the external crust of the earth furnishes unimpeachable testimony of its great antiquity ; if the very slow but continuous displacement of the sea-bottom , ' certified by the numerous monuments left everywhere about , gives further confirmation of its prodigious antiquity ; then the belief is justified that the state of perfection at which the organisation of the most perfect animals has arrived , contributes to exhibit that truth in the strongest possible light . But in order that this new proof may be securely based , it will first be necessary to bring into evidence the facts concerning the actual progress of organisation ; it will be necessary to verify if possible the reality of that progress ; finally , it will be necessary to collect the best established facts and to identify nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let us note that , although the term productions of nature is generally accepted for indicating the beings vv which constitute each kingdom , it seems none the less that no definite idea is attached to that expression . Apparently , prejudices of special origin prevent the recognition of the fact that , nature possesses the faculty of herself bringing so many different beings into existence ; of causing incessant though very slow variations in living races : and of maintaining everywhere the general order that we observe . Let us leave aside all opinion whatever on these great subjects ; and to avoid any error of imagination let us everywhere consult nature 's own works . In order to be able to bring under our attention the totality of existing animals , and to place these animals under an aspect easily understood , we must remember that all the natural productions that we can observe have long been divided by naturalists into three kingdoms , under the name of animal kingdom , vegetable kingdom and mineral kingdom . By this division , the existences comprised in each of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some have a very different origin from others . // For some time past I have found it more convenient to employ another primary division which is better calculated to give an idea of the beings dealt with . Thus , I distinguish the natural productions comprised in the three aforementioned kingdoms into two main branches : 1 . Organised living bodies ; 2 . Crude bodies without life . Living beings , such as animals and plants , constitute the first of these two branches of the productions of nature . They possess , as everyone knows , the faculties of alimentation , development , reproduction , and they are subject to death . But what is not known so well , since the fashionable hypotheses do not permit of the belief , is that living bodies form for themselves their own substances and secretions , as a result of the activity and functions of their organs and of the mutations wrought in them by organic movements ( Hydrogeologie , p. 112 ) . What is still less known is that the exuviae of these living bodies give rise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be found in nature , utters of which the various kinds increase in course of time and according to the conditions , by reason of the disintegration which they imperceptibly undergo . For this disintegration simplifies them re and more , and after a long period leads to the complete ration of their constituent principles . These are the various crude and lifeless matters , both solid and uid , which compose the second branch of the productions of re , and most of which are known under the name of minerals . It may be said that an immense hiatus exists between crude matters living bodies , and that this hiatus does not permit of a linear arrangement of these two kinds of bodies , nor of any attempt to to them by a link , as has been vainly attempted . All known living bodies are sharply divided into two special kingdoms , I on the essential differences which distinguish animals from two kingdoms ; and in spite of what has been said I am convinced that these kingdoms do not really merge into one another at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as implied by the zoophyte , nor plant-animals . Irritability in all or some of their parts is the most general characc of animals ; it is more general than the faculty of voluntary ' tents and of feeling , more even than that of digestion . Now all plants , as I have elsewhere shown , are completely destitute of irritability , not , even excepting the so-called sensitive plants nor those move certain of their parts on being touched or brought into contact wtih the air . // It is known that irritability is a faculty essential to the parts or to certain parts of animals , and that it is never suspended or annihilated so long as the animal is alive and the part possessing it has suffered no injury . Its effect is seen in a contraction which takes place instantly throughout the irritable part on contact with a foreign body ; a contraction which ends with its cause , and which is renewed whenever the part after relaxation is irritated by new contacts . Now nothing of this kind has ever been observed in any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sensitive plant ( Mimosa pudica ) , instead of a contraction I observe in the joints of the disturbed branches and petioles a relaxation , which permits these branches and petioles of the leaves to droop , and causes the leaflets themselves to sink down upon one another . When once that sinking has been produced it is useless to touch again the branches and leaves of this plant ; no effect follows . A longish time is required , unless it is very hot , for the distension of the joints of the small branches and leaves of the sensitive plant ; when all these parts will again be raised and spread out , ready to fall together once more upon a contact or slight shaking . I can not see in this phenomenon any relation to the irritability of animals . I reflected however that during growth , especially when it is hot , there are produced in plants many elastic fluids , part of which are incessantly being exhaled . Pence I conceived that in leguminous plants these elastic fluids might accumulate , especially in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they might then distend these joints and keep the leaves or leaflets spread out . In this case , the slow dissipation of the elastic fluids in question set up in leguminous plants by the approach of night ; or the sudden dissipation of the same fluid set up in Mimosa pudica by a slight shaking , will give rise for leguminous plants in general to the phenomenon known under the name of sleep , and for the sensitive plant to that wrongly attributed to irritability . ) It follows from the observations which I shall set forth below , and from the inferences which I have drawn from them , that in general // it is not true that animals are sensitive creatures endowed without exception with the power of producing acts of will , and consequently with the faculty of voluntary locomotion . Hence the definition of animals hitherto given to distinguish them from plants is altogether unsuitable ; in consequence , I have already proposed to substitute the following as more in harmony with the facts , and more suitable to characterise the beings which compose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Animals are organised living bodies , which have irritable parts at all times of their lives ; which nearly all digest the food on which they live ; and which move , some by acts of will , either free or dependent , and others by stimulated irritability . DEFINITION OF PLANTS . Plants are organised living bodies whose parts are never irritable , which do not digest or move either by will or true irritability . We see from these definitions , which are much sounder and more accurate than those hitherto received , that animals are primarily distinguished from plants by the irritability which all or some of their parts possess , and by the movements that they can produce these parts , or which are set up by external causes as a sequence their irritability . It would doubtless be wrong to agree to these new ideas merely nut hority ; but I think that every unprejudiced reader who takes to consideration the facts and observations which I shall set forth the course of the present work will be unable to deny them pretwo over the ancient ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are obviously contrary to all observation . We shall terminate this general outlook upon animals by two somet curious considerations : one concerning the extreme multiplicity animals on the surface of the earth and in the waters , the other concerning the means adopted by nature to ensure that their number shall never become injurious to the preservation of her productions of the general order which should exist . the t V() kingdoms of living bodies that comprising the animals is much richer and more varied than the other : at the same it exhibits more wonderful phenomena in its organisation . ' surface of the earth , the waters , and to some extent even the air are populated by an infinite multitude of diverse animals , the races of which are so varied and numerous that a large proportion of them // will probably always evade our researches . This is rendered the more likely since the enormous extent of water , its depth in many places , and the prodigious fertility of nature in the smallest species will doubtless be for all time an almost insuperable obstacle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invertebrate animals , such as insects for instance , equals the entire vegetable kingdom in the number and diversity of its contained objects . The class of polyps is apparently much more numerous still , but we shall never be able to flatter ourselves that we know all the animals which make it up . As a result of the rapid multiplication of the small species , and particularly of the more imperfect animals , the multiplicity of individuals might have injurious effects upon the preservation of races , upon the progress made in perfection of organisation , in short , upon the general order , if nature had not taken precautions to restrain that multiplication within limits that can never be exceeded . Animals eat each other , except those which live only on plants ; but these are liable to be devoured by carnivorous animals . We know that it is the stronger and the better equipped that eat the weaker , and that the larger species devour the smaller . Nevertheless , individuals rarely eat others of the same race as themselves ; they make war on different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so great , and the succession of generations is so rapid , that these small species would render the globe uninhabitable to any others , if ' nature had not set a limit to their prodigious multiplication . But since they serve as prey to a multitude of other animals , and since the duration of their life is very short and they are killed by any fall of temperature , their numbers are always maintained in t he proper proportions for the preservation of their own and other races . As to the larger and stronger animals , they might well become dominant and have bad effects upon the preservation of many other races if they could multiply in too large proportions ; but their races devour one another , and they only multiply slowly and few at a time ; and this maintains in their case also the kind of equilibrium that should exist . Lastly , man alone , considered apart from all that is special to him , seems to be able to multiply indefinitely , for his intelligence and powers protect him from any limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He exercises a supremacy over them , so that instead of having to fear the larger and stronger races of animals , he is capable rather of extinguishing them , and he is continually keeping down their numbers . // But nature has given him numerous passions which unfortunately develop with his intelligence , and thus set up a great obstacle to the extreme multiplication of individuals of his species . It seems , in fact , that man is himself responsible for continually keeping down the numbers of his kind ; for I have no hesitation in saying that the earth will never be covered by the population that it might support ; several of its habitable regions will always be sparsely populated in turns , although the period of these fluctuations are , so far as we are concerned , immeasurable . By these wise precautions , everything is thus preserved in the established order ; the continual changes and renewals which are observed in that order are kept within limits that they can not pass ; all the races of living bodies continue to exist in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of organisation is lost ; what appears to be disorder , confusion , anomaly , incessantly passes again into the general order , and even contributes to it ; everywhere and always the will of the Sublime Author of nature and of everything that exists is invariably carried out . Before devoting ourselves to showing the degradation and simplification existing in the organisation of animals , when we proceed according to custom from the most complex to the simplest , let us examine ' their true arrangement and classification , as well as the principles ' employed for this purpose . It will then be easier for us to recognise e proofs of the degradation in question . CHAPTER V. ON THE TRUE ARRANGEMENT AND CLASSIFICATION OF ANIMALS . For the progress of zoological philosophy and the object that we have in view , it is necessary to enquire into the true arrangement and classification of animals ; to consider how such an arrangement came about ; to ascertain what principles should be observed in setting up that general arrangement ; and , finally , to investigate what remains to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmony with the actual order of nature . But in order that our studies may be profitable , we must first determine the essential aims of an arrangement and of a classification of animals ; for these two aims are very different in nature . The aim of a general arrangement of animals is not only to possess a convenient list for consulting , but it is more particularly to have an order in that list which represents as nearly as possible the actual order followed by nature in the production of animals ; an order conspicuously indicated by the affinities which she has set between them . The aim of a classification of animals , on the other hand , is to furnish points of rest for our imagination , by means of lines of demarcation drawn at intervals in the general series ; so that we may be able more easily to identify each race already discovered , to grasp its affinities with other known animals , and to place newly discovered species in their proper position . This device makes up for our own shortcomings , facilitates our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us ; but I have already shown that it is a produce of artifice , and that despite appearances it corresponds to nothing real in nature . An accurate determination of affinities between objects will always begin by fixing in our general arrangements the place of the large groups or primary divisions ; then that of the lesser groups , and lastly that of the species or special races that have been observed . Now here is the inestimable advantage accruing to science from a knowARRANGEMENT // ledge of affinities . Since these affinities are the actual work of nature , no naturalist will ever be able or indeed desire to alter the consequences of a recognised affinity . The general arrangement will thus become ever more perfect and less arbitrary , according as our knowledge of affinities becomes greater . The case is different with classifications : that is to say , with the various lines of demarcation that we have to draw at intervals in the general list both of animals and plants . In truth , so long as there are gaps remaining to be filled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet been observed , we shall always find these lines of demarcation , which appear to be drawn by nature herself ; but this illusion will vanish as our observations accumulate . Have we not already witnessed the effacement of a great number , at least in the smaller divisions , by reason of the numerous discoveries of naturalists during the last half century ? Except for the lines of demarcation resulting from gaps to be filled , those which we shall always have to draw will be arbitrary and therefore changeable , so long as naturalists du not adopt some conventional principle for their guidance . In the animal kingdom such a principle is that every class should comprise animals distinguished by a special system of organisation . The strict execution of this principle is quite easy , and attended only with minor inconveniences . In short , although nature does not pass abruptly from one system f organisation to another , it is possible to draw boundaries between cli system , in such a way that there is only a small number of animals ar those boundaries and admitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines of demarcation which sub-divide classes are usually re difficult to establish , since they depend on less important ratters ; and for this reason are more arbitrary . Before examining the true classification of animals , let me endeavour show that the list of living bodies should form a series , at least as arils the main groups ; and not a branching net-work . CLASSES SHOULD FORM A SERIES IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF ANIMALS . Man is condemned to exhaust all possible errors when he examines any set of facts before he recognises the truth . Thus it has been denied t t he productions of nature in each kingdom of living bodies can really be arranged in a true series according to their affinities ; and t there exists any scale in the general arrangement either of animals or plants .. Naturalists , for instance , have noticed that many species , certain genera and even some families appear to a certain extent isolated Z8 ZOOLOGICAL PHILOSOPHY in their characters ; and several have imagined that the affinities among living beings may be represented something after the manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small wellmarked series , called natural families , as being arranged in the form of a reticulation . This idea , which some modern writers think sublime , is clearly a mistake , and is certain to be dispelled when we have a deeper and wider knowledge of organisation ; and especially when the distinction is recognised between what is due to the influence of environment and habits and what is due to the greater or less progress in the complexity or perfection of organisation . Meanwhile I shall show that nature , by giving existence in the course of long periods of time to all the animals and plants , has really formed a true scale in each of these kingdoms as regards the increasing complexity of organisation ; but that the gradations in this scale , which we are bound to recognise when we deal with objects according to their natural affinities , are only perceptible in the main groups of the general series , and not in the species or even in the genera . This fact arises from the extreme diversity of conditions in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions have no relation to the increasing complexity of organisation , as I shall show ; but they produce anomalies or deviations in the external shape and characters which could not have been brought about solely by the growing complexity of organisation . We have then only to prove that the series constituting the animal scale resides essentially in the arrangement of the main groups composing it , and not in that of species , nor always even of genera . The series to which I have alluded can then only be made out among the larger groups ; since each of these groups , constituting the classes and bigger families , comprises beings whose organisation is dependent on some special system of essential organs . Thus each distinct group has its special system of essential organs ; and it is these special systems which undergo a degradation as we pass from the most complex to the simplest . But each organ taken by itself does not proceed so regularly irr its degradations : and less so in proportion to its lesser importance and greater susceptibility to modification by environment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not essential to life are not always at the same stage of perfection or degradation ; so that if we follow all the species of a class we shall see that some one organ of any species reaches its highest degree of perfection , while some other organ , which in that same species is quite undeveloped or imperfect , reaches in some other species a high state of perfection . // These irregularities in the perfection and degradation of inessential organs are found in those organs which are the most exposed to the influence of the environment ; this influence involves similar irregularities in the .. shape and condition of the external parts , and gives rise to so great and singular a diversity of species that , instead of being arranged like the main groups in a single linear series as a regularly graduated scale , these species often constitute lateral ramifications around the groups to which they belong , and their extremities are in reality isolated points . A much more powerful and lasting set of conditions is necessary to modify any internal system of organisation than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that in cases of necessity nature passes from one system to another without a break , if they are closely allied ; it is indeed by this faculty that she succeeded in fashioning them all in turn , passing from the simplest to the most complex . So true is it that she has this faculty , that she even passes from one system to another not merely in two different allied families but in one individual . Those systems of organisation in which respiration is carried on by true lungs are nearer to the systems requiring gills than to those requiring tracheae ; thus , nature not only passes from gills to lungs in allied asses and families , as is seen among fishes and reptiles , but she does even during the existence of one individual : which possesses in turn first one and then the other system . It is known that the frog , in its imperfect condition of tadpole , breathes by gills ; while in its ore perfect condition of frog it breathes by lungs . But nowhere does nature pass from the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then be truly said that in each kingdom of living bodies the ups are arranged in a single graduated series , in conformity with the creasing complexity of organisation and the affinities of the object . is series in the animal and vegetable kingdoms should contain the simplest and least organised of living bodies at its anterior extremity , and ends with those whose organisation and faculties are most perfect . Much appears to be the true order of nature , and such indeed is r order clearly disclosed to us by the most careful observation and extended study of all her modes of procedure . We have seen the necessity of paying attention to the question of affinities , in drawing up our arrangements of the productions of nature ; we we are no longer able to arrange the general series in any way like . Our knowledge of nature 's methods continues to increase proportion to our studies of the affinities between objects or various // groups of objects ; and this knowledge compels us to conform to her order . The first result obtained from the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the two extremities of the order must be occupied by the most dissimilar beings , since they are the most distant from one another from the point of view of affinities , and consequently of organisation . Hence it follows that if one of the extremities of the order is occupied by the most perfect of living bodies , having the most complex organisation , the other extremity of the order must necessarily be occupied by the most imperfect of living bodies , namely , those whose organisation is the simplest . In the general arrangement of known plants according to the natural methods , that is according to affinities , only one extremity is thoroughly known ; and that is occupied by the cryptogams . If the other extremity is not determined with equal certainty , it is due to the fact that our knowledge of plant organisation is much less advanced than our knowledge of the organisation of a great number of known animals . Hence it follows that in the case of plants we have as yet no certain guide to the affinities between the large groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The same difficulty does not exist in the case of animals , and both extremities of their general series are thus definitely fixed ; for as long as importance is attached to the natural method , and hence to affinities , the mammals will of necessity occupy one extremity of the order , while the infusorians will he placed at , the other . For animals then , as well as for plants , there exists in nature an order arising , like the objects which it ; calls into existence , from powers conferred by the Supreme Author of all things . Nature is herself only the general and immutable order created everywhere by this Sublime Author ; she is the sum total of the general and special laws to which that order is subject . By these powers , which she continues unchangeably to make use of , she has given and still continues to give existence to her productions ; she is incessantly varying and renewing them , and thus maintains everywhere the entire order which results . We were obliged to recognise this order of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already in possession of various parts of it , in our better constituted families and genera . We shall now see that in the animal kingdom it is established in its outlines in a way that leaves no scope for arbitrary opinion . But the great number of divers animals that we have come to know , and the brilliant light shed by comparative anatomy on their organisation , now place it in our power definitely to draw up the general list of all known animals , and to assign definitely the rank of the main // divisions that may be established in the series which they constitute . This it behoves us to recognise ; it would indeed be difficult to dispute . Let us now pass to the actual arrangement and classification of animals . THE TRUE ARRANGEMENT AND CLASSIFICATION OF ANIMALS . Since the purpose and principles both of a general arrangement and of a classification of living animals were not at first perceived when these subjects were studied , the works of naturalists long suffered from this imperfection of our ideas . The same thing happened in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others to which much attention was given , before any principles had been thought out to constitute a basis and to guide their labours . Instead of subjecting the classification which had to be made in each kingdom of living bodies to an arrangement which should be quite unfettered , attention was entirely devoted to disposing objects in convenient classes , so that their arrangement was thus abandoned to arbitrary opinion . The affinities among the larger groups in the vegetable kingdom , for example , were very difficult to grasp ; and artificial systems were long made use of in botany . They facilitated the making of convenient classificiations based upon arbitrary principles , so that every author drew p a new one according to his fancy . Thus the proper arrangement of lasts according to the natural method was then always sacrificed . It only since we have recognised the importance of the parts concerned with fruiting , and the greater importance of some than others that the general arrangement of plants began to make progress towards perfection . As the case of animals is different , the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceive : so that several of these groups were identified at the very beginning of the study of natural history . Aristotle indeed divided animals primarily into two main divisions us he called it , two classes , viz. : // This primary division of animals into two main groups was fairly good , but the character taken by Aristotle for discrimination was bad . That philosopher gave the name of blood to the chief fluid in animals which has a red colour . He imagined that all animals which he placed in his second class only possessed white or whitish fluids ; and he thereupon regarded them as having no blood . Such apparently was the first outline of a classification of animals ; it is at luny rate the oldest of which we have any knowledge . But this classification also furnishes the earliest example of an arrangement , though in the opposite direction from the order of nature ; since we may notice in it a progression , though a very imperfect one , from the most complex to the simplest . That erroneous direction has been generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this has clearly retarded our knowledge of nature 's procedure . Modern naturalists have endeavoured to improve upon Aristotle 's division by giving to the animals in the first class the name of redblooded animals , and to those in his second class that of white-blooded animals . It is now well known how defective is this character ; since there are some invertebrate animals ( many annelids ) which have red blood . In my opinion the essential fluids of animals do not deserve the name of blood , except when they circulate in arteries and veins ; for the other fluids are so degraded , and the combination of their principles so imperfect , that it would be wrong to assimilate them to fluids which have a true circulation One might as well attribute blood to a plant as to a radiarian or polyp . In order to avoid ambiguity and hypothesis , I divided the entire known animal world in my first course of lectures at the Museum in the spring of 1794 ( the year II . of the republic ) into two perfectly distinct groups , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I called the attention of my pupils to the fact that the vertebral column , among animals provided with it , indicates the possession of a more or less perfect skeleton and of a plan of organisation on the same plane ; whereas its absence among other animals not only distinguishes them sharply from the first , but shows that their whole plan of organisation is very different from those of vertebrate animals . From Aristotle to Linnaeus nothing of note appeared with regard to the general arrangement of animals ; but in the course of last century naturalists of the highest distinction made a large number of special observations on animals , and especially on many inverteARRANGEMENT // brate animals . Some recorded their anatomy with greater or less fulness , while others gave an accurate and detailed history of the metamorphoses and habits of a great number of these animals ; as a result of their valuable observations , we have become acquainted with many facts of the greatest importance . At length Linnaeus , a man of high genius and one of the greatest of naturalists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for great accuracy in the determination of all kinds of characters , gave us the following classification for animals . He divided known animals into six classes , based upon three stages cr characters of organisation . Except for the inversion displayed by this arrangement as by all others the four first divisions proposed are now definitely established , and will henceforth always obtain the assent of zoologists as to their position in the general series . For this we are primarily indebted to the illustrious Swedish naturalist . The case is different with regard to the two final divisions of the arrangement in question ; they are wrong and very badly disposed . Since they comprise the greater number of known animals of the most varied characters , they should be more numerous . Hence it has been necessary to re-constitute them and substitute others . We have seen that Linnus , and the naturalists who succeeded him , gave very little attention to the necessity for increasing the number of divisions among animals which have a cold serum in place of blood ( invertebrate animals ) , and whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have divided these numerous animals into two classes only , viz. insects and worms ; so that everything hich was not regarded as an insect , that is to say all invertebrate nimals that have not jointed legs , were referred without exception o the class of worms . They placed the class of insects after the fishes , lid the worms after the insects . According to this arrangement of Linnaus , the worms constituted the final class of the animal kingdom . These two classes are still maintained in the same order in all the editions of the Systema Naturae published subsequently to Linnaeus . The essential vice of this arrangement . as regards the natural order of ti4 ZOOLOGICAL PHILOSOPHY animals , is obvious ; it can not be denied that Linnaeus 's class of worms is a sort of chaos in which the most disparate objects are included . Yet the authority of that savant carried so much weight among naturalists , that no one dared to change this monstrous class of worms . With a view to bringing about some useful reform in this respect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invertebrate animals , which I divided not into two classes , but into five in the following order . These classes were then identical with some of the orders which Bruguire had suggested in his arrangement of worms ( which I did not adopt ) , and with the class of insects as defined by Linnaeus . The arrival of M. Cuvier in Paris however , towards the middle of the year III . ( 1795 ) , drew the attention of zoologists to the organisation of animals . I then saw with much satisfaction the conclusive evidence which he produced in favour of the priority of rank accorded to molluscs over insects in the general series . This I had already impressed in my lessons ; but it had not been favourably received by the naturalists of this capital . The change which 1 had thus instituted , from a consciousness of the inadequacy of the prevailing arrangement , of Linnaeus , was thoroughly consolidated by M. Cuvier by the most definite facts , several of which , it is true , were already known but had not attracted ourattention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since his arrival by this savant over every section of zoology , and particularly over invertebrate animals which he called white-blooded animals . I then added in turn new classes to my arrangement ; I was the first to establish them ; but , as we shall see , such of those classes as were adopted were only adopted reluctantly . The personal interests of authors are doubtless a matter of complete indifference to science , and also apparently to those who study it . Nevertheless , a knowledge of the history of the changes undergone during the last fifteen years by the classification of animals is not without its uses : the following are those which I have instituted . First , I changed the name of my class of echinoderms to radiarians , in order to unite with them the jelly-fishes and neighbouring genera . // This class , notwithstanding its utility and inevitableness , has not yet been adopted by naturalists . In my course in the year VII . ( 1799 ) I established the class of crustaceans . At that time M. Cuvier , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with insects ; and although this class is essentially distinct , yet it was not till six or seven years later that a few naturalists consented to adopt it . The following year , that is to say , in my course of the year VIII . ( 1800 ) I suggested the arachnids as a class by itself , easy and necessary to diistinguish . From that time its characters have constituted a sure indication of an organisation peculiar to these animals ; for it is impossible to believe that they arose from an organisation exactly similar to the insects . Insects undergo metamorphosis , propagate only once in the course of their life , and have only two antennae , two eyes with facets and six jointed legs ; while the arachnids never undergo metamorphosis , and exhibit various characters besides which differentiate them from insects . his fact has since been partly confirmed by observation . Yet this class arachnids is still not admitted into any other work than my own . M. Cuvier had discovered the existence of arterial and venous vessels in various animals , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other animals of very different organisation . I immediately took this new fact into consideration for the improvement of my classification ; and in my course in the year X. ( 1802 ) I established the class of annelids , placing them after the molluscs and before the crustaceans , as required by their organisation . By giving a special name to this new class I was able to keep the old name of worms for the animals which have always borne it , and whose organisation was remote from the annelids . So I continued place the worms after the insects , and to distinguish them from the radiarians and polyps with which they can never again be united . My class of annelids , published in my lectures and in my Recherches sur les corps vivants ( p. 24 ) , was several years before being admitted by naturalists . For the last two years however this class has begun to gain recognition ; but since it is held desirable to change the name of it and to call it by the name of worms , they do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no nerves or circulasystcni . In this difficulty they combine them with the class of polyps , although their organisation is very different . These instances of perfection at first attained in a classification , destroyed and subsequently re-established by the necessity of things are not rare in natural science . Linnaeus in fact united several genera of plants which Tournefort had formerly distinguished as in the case of Polygonum , Mimosa , E // Justicia , Convallaria , and many others ; and now botanists are reestablishing the genera which Linnaeus had destroyed . Finally last year ( in my course of 1807 ) I established among invertebrate animals a new class ? the tenth ? that of infusorians ; because after a careful examination of the characters of these imperfect animals , I was convinced that I had been wrong to place them with the polyps . Thus , by continuing to collect facts from observation and from the rapid progress of comparative anatomy , I instituted successively the various classes which now compose my arrangement of invertebrate animals . These classes , to the number of ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simplest as usual , viz. : I shall show , when I come to deal with each of these classes , that they constitute necessary groups , since they are based upon a study of organisation ; and that although races may , nay must , exist near the boundaries , half way between two classes , yet these groups are the best attainable by artifice . They will therefore have to be recognised , so long as the interest of science is our chief concern . By adding to these ten classes into which the invertebrates are divided , the four classes of vertebrate animals identified and determined by Linnaeus , we shall have a classification of all known animals into the following fourteen classes , set out once more in the opposite order to that of nature . // The above represents the true arrangement of animals , and also 1 he classes established among them . We now have to examine a very important problem , which appears ever to have been fathomed nor discussed ; but the solution of which necessary ; it is this : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided , necessarily form a series of groups arranged according to the increasing or decreasing complexity of their organisation . In drawing up this series , ought e to proceed from the most complex to the simplest , or from the simplest to the most complex ? We shall endeavour to give the solution of this problem in Chap . II . which concludes this part ; but we must first examine a very remarkable fact , most worthy of our attention , which may lead us a perception of nature 's procedure , when bringing her diverse productions into existence . I refer to that remarkable degradation of organisation which is found on traversing the natural series of animals , starting from the most perfect or the most complex towards the simplest most imperfect . though this degradation neither is nor can be finely graduated as all show , it so obviously and universally exists in the main groups , tiding even the variations , that it doubtless depends on some general law which it behoves us to discover and consequently to 01 for . CHAPTER VI . DEGRADATION AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE ANIMAL CHAIN , PROCEEDING FROM THE MOST COMPLEX TO THE SIMPLEST . AMONG the problems of interest for zoological philosophy , one of the most important is that which concerns the degradation and simplification observed in animal organisation on passing from one extreme to the other of the animal chain , from the most perfect animals to those whose organisations are the simplest . Now the question arises whether this is a fact that can be established ; for , if so , it will greatly enlighten us as to nature 's plan and will set us on the way to discover some of her most important laws . I here propose to prove that the fact in question is true , and that it is the result of a constant law of nature which always acts with uniformity ; but that a certain special and easily recognised cause produces variations now and again in the results which that law achieves throughout the animal chain . We must first recognise that the general series of animals arranged according to their natural affinities is a series of special groups which result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that these groups are themselves arranged according to the decreasing complexity of organisation , so as to form a real chain . We notice then that except for the anomalies , of which we shall ascertain the cause , there exists from one end to the other of this chain a striking degradation in the organisation of the animals composing it , and a proportionate diminution in the numbers of these animals ' faculties . Thus if the most perfect animals are at one extremity of the chain , the opposite extremity will necessarily be occupied by the simplest and most imperfect animals found in nature . This examination at length convinces us that all the special organs are progressively simplified from class to class , that they become altered , reduced and attenuated little by little , that they lose their // local concentration if they are of the first importance , and that finally they are completely and definitely extinguished before the opposite end of the chain is reached . As a matter of fact , the degradation of which I speak is not always gradual and regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes abruptly , and these changes sometimes involve it in peculiar shapes not related with any other by recognisable steps . Often again some organ disappears and re-appears several times before it is definitely extinguished . But we shall see that this could of have been otherwise ; for the factor which brings about the proessive complexity of organisation must have had varied effects , wing to its liability to modification by a certain other factor acting ith great power . We shall however see that the degradation in uestion is none the less real and progressive , wherever its effects n be seen . I f the factor which is incessantly working towards complicating ganisation were the only one which had any influence on the shape d organs of animals , the growing complexity of organisation would erywhere be very regular . But it is not ; nature is forced to submit works to the influence of their environment , and this environment erywhere produces variations in them . This is the special factor which occasionally produces in the course of the degradation that we were about to exemplify , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progression . We shall attempt to set forth in full both the progressive degradation of animal organisation and the cause of the anomalies in the progress of that degradation , in the course of the animal series . t is obvious that , if nature had given existence to none but aquatic als and if all these animals had always lived in the same climate , same kind of water , the same depth , etc. , etc. , we should then doubt have found a regular and even continuous gradation in the nisation of these animals . Kit the power of nature is not confined within such limits . It first has to be observed that even in the waters she has established considerable diversity of conditions : fresh-water , sea water , still or stagnant water , running water , the water of hot climates , of cold 1 ' 0 ( .8 , and lastly shallow water and very deep water ; these provide ninny special conditions which each act differently on the animals living in them . Now the races of animals exposed to any of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been varied by them all the while that their complexity of organisation has been advancing . After having produced aquatic animals of all ranks and having // caused extensive variations in them by the different environments provided by the waters , nature led them little by little to the habit of living in the air , first by the water 's edge and afterwards on all the dry parts of the globe . These animals have in course of time been profoundly altered by such novel conditions ; which so greatly influenced their habits and organs that the regular gradation which they should have exhibited in complexity of organisation is often scarcely recognisable . These results which I have long studied , and shall definitely prove , lead me to state the following zoological principle , the truth of which appears to me beyond question . Progress in complexity of organisation exhibits anomalies here and there in the general series of animals , due to the influence of environment and of acquired habits . An examination of these anomalies has led some to reject the obvious progress in complexity of animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the production of living bodies . Nevertheless , in spite of the apparent digressions that I have just mentioned , the general plan of nature and the uniformity of her procedure , however much she varies her methods , are still quite easily distinguished . We have only to examine the general series of known animals and to consider it first in its totality and then in its larger groups ; the most unequivocal proofs will then be perceived of the gradation which she has followed in complexity of organisation ; a gradation which should never be lost sight of by reason of the aforementioned anomalies . Finally , it will be noticed that whenever there have been no extreme changes of conditions , that gradation is found to be perfectly regular in various portions of the general series to which we have given the name of families . This truth becomes still more striking in the study of species ; for the more we observe , the more difficult , complicated and minute become our specific distinctions . The gradation in complexity of animal organisation can no longer be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and detailed proof of what we have just stated . Now since we are taking the general series of animals in the opposite direction from nature 's actual order when she brought them successively into existence , this gradation becomes for us a remarkable degradation which prevails from one end to the other of the animal chain , except for the gaps arising from objects which are not yet discovered and those which arise from anomalies caused by extreme environmental conditions . Let us now cast an eye over the complexity and totality of the animal , series , in order to establish positively the degradation of organisation from one extremity to the other ; let us consider the facts presented // and let us then pass rapidly in review the fourteen classes of which it is primarily composed . The general arrangement of animals set forth above is unanimously accepted as a whole by zoologists : who dispute only as to the boundaries of certain classes . In examining it I notice a very obvious fact which would in itself be decisive for my purpose ; it is as follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we are accustomed to consider as the anterior ) we find the animals that are most perfect from all points of view , and have the most complex organisation ; while at the opposite extremity of the same series we find the most imperfect that exist in nature ? those with the simplest organisation and to all appearances hardly endowed with animality . This accepted fact , which indeed can not be questioned , becomes e first proof of the degradation which I propose to establish ; for t is a necessary condition of it . Another fact brought forward by an examination of the general ries of animals and furnishing a second proof of the degradation evailing in their organisation from one extremity to the other of their chain , is the following : The first four classes of the animal kingdom contain animals that e in general provided with a vertebral column , while the animals of the other classes are absolutely destitute of it . It is known that the vertebral column is the essential basis of the skeleton , which can not exist without it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more or less complete and perfect eton . It is also known that perfection of faculties is a proof of perfection the organs on which they rest . Now although man may be above his rank on account of the extreme superioroity of his intelligence as compared with his organisation , assuredly presents the type of the highest perfection that nature attain to : hence the more an animal organisation approaches the more perfect it is . Admitting this , I observe that the human body not only possesses jointed skeleton but one that is above all others the most complete perfect in all its parts . This skeleton stiffens his body , provides Brous points of attachment for his muscles and allows him an endless variation of movement . lice the skeleton is a main feature in the plan of organisation of human body , it is obvious that every animal possessed of a skeleton of a more perfect organisation than those without it . Hence the invertebrate animals are more imperfect than the invertebrate animals ; hence , too , if we place the most perfect animals // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series exhibits a real degradation in organisation ; since after the first four classes all the animals of the following classes are without a skeleton and consequently have a less perfect organisation . But this is not all : Degradation may be observed even among the vertebrates themselves ; and we shall see finally that it is found also among the invertebrates . Hence this degradation follows from the fixed plan of nature , and is at the same time a result of our following her order in the inverse direction ; for if we followed her actual order , if , that is to say , we passed along the general series of animals from the most , imperfect to the most perfect , instead of a degradation in organisation we should find a growing complexity and we should sec animal faculties successively increasing in number and perfection . In order to prove the universal existence of the alleged degradation , let us now rapidly run through the various classes of the animal kingdom . MAMMALS . Animals with mammae , four jointed limbs , and all the organs essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the body . Mammals ( Mammalia , Lin. ) should obviously be at one extremity of the animal chain , viz. that which contains the most perfect animals and the richest in organisation and faculties ; for among them alone are found those with the most developed intelligence . If perfection of faculties is a proof of that of the organs they are based upon as I said above , all mammals ( and they alone are truly viviparous ) must have the most perfect organisation , since it is agreed that these animals have more intelligence , more faculties and a more perfect set of senses than any others ; moreover their organisation approaches most nearly to that of man . Their organisation exhibits a body whose parts are stiffened by a jointed skeleton , which is generally more complete in these animals than in the three other classes of vertebrates . Most of them have four articulated limbs appended to the skeleton ; and all have a diaphragm between the chest and abdomen ; a heart with two ventricles and two auricles ; red warm blood ; free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood passes before being driven to the other parts of the body ; lastly , they are the only viviparous animals , for they are the only animals in which the foetus although enclosed within its membranes is always in communication with its mother and develops at the expense of her substance , and in which the young feed for some time after their birth on the milk of her mammae. // It is then the mammals that must occupy the first rank in the animal kingdom by virtue of their perfection of organisation and greatest number of faculties ( Recherches sur les corps vivants , p. 15 ) . After the mammals we no longer find a definitely viviparous reproduction , nor lungs limited by a diaphragm to the chest and receiving all the blood which has to be driven to the rest of the body , etc. , etc . Among the mammals themselves it is in truth not easy to distinguish what is really due to degradation from what is the effect of environment , manner of life and long-established habits . Nevertheless , traces of the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those whose limbs are adapted for grasping objects have a higher perfection than those whose limbs are adapted only for walking . It is among the former that man is placed in respect of his organisation . Now it is clear that since the organisation of man is the most perfect , it should be regarded as the standard for judging of the perfection or degradation of the other animal organisations . Thus the three divisions , into which the class of mammals is unequally broken up , exhibit among themselves , as we shall see , a conspicuous degradation in the organisation of the animals they contain . First division : unguiculate mammals ; they have four limbs , flat or pointed claws at the end of their digits but not investing them . These limbs are in general adapted for grasping objects or at least for hooking on to them . It is among these that the animals with the most perfect organisation are found . Second division : ungulate mammals ; they have four limbs and the extremity of their digits is completely invested by a rounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose than that of silk leg or running on the ground , and can not be employed either for climbing trees , or for grasping any object or prey , or for attacking and rending other animals . They feed exclusively on vegetable substances . Third division : exungulate mammals ; they have only two limbs these limbs are very short , flat and shaped like fins . Their digits invested by skin and have no claws or horn . Their organisation e least perfect of all mammals . They have no pelvis , nor hind ; they swallow without previous mastication ; finally they it tinily live in the water ; but they come to the surface to breathe They have received the name of cetaceans . Although the amphibians also live in the water , coming out of it occasionally to crawl upon the shore , they really belong to the first division in the natural order , and not to that which comprises the crustaceans . // Henceforth we have to distinguish the degradation of organisation which arises from the influence of environment and acquired habits , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or complexity of organisation . We must be careful therefore about going into too much detail in this respect ; because as I shall show the environment in which animals habitually live , their special habitats , the habits which circumstances have forced upon them , their manner of life , etc. , have a great power to modify organs ; so that the shapes of parts might be attributed to degradation when they are really due to other causes . It is obvious for example that the amphibians and cetaceans must have greatly shortened limbs , since they live habitually in a dense medium where well-developed limbs would only impede their movements . It is obvious that the influence of the water alone must have made them such as they are , by interfering with the movements of very long limbs with solid internal parts ; and that consequently these animals owe their general shape to the influence of the medium they inhabit . But with regard to that degradation which we are seeking among the mammals themselves , the amphibians must be far removed from the cetaceans because their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amphibians then have to be joined to the unguiculate mammals , while the cetaceans should form the last order of the class , as being the most imperfect mammals . We now pass to the birds ; but I must first note that there is no gradation between mammals and birds . There exists a gap to be filled , and no doubt nature has produced animals which practically fill this gap , and which must form a special class if they can not be comprised either among the mammals or among the birds . This fact has just been realised , by the recent discovery in Australia of two genera of animals , viz. : These animals are quadrupeds with no mammae , with no teeth inserted and no lips ; and they have only one orifice for the genital organs , the excrements and the urine ( a cloaca ) . Their body is covered with hair or bristles . They are not mammals , for they have no mammae and are most likely oviparous . They are not birds ; for their lungs are not pierced through and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are not reptiles ; for their heart with only two ventricles removes them from that category . They belong then to a special class . // BIRDS . Animals without mammae , with two feet and two arms shaped as wings ; the body covered with feathers . The second rank clearly belongs to the birds ; for while we do not find among these animals so many faculties or so much intelligence as among the animals of the first rank , they are the only ones except the monotremes which have like mammals a heart with two ventricles and two auricles , warm blood , the cavity of the cranium completely filled by the brain , and the trunk always enclosed by ribs . They have , then , qualities common to mammals , but not found elsewhere ; and consequently affinities with them that are not to be found in any animals of the posterior classes . But the birds when compared with the mammals display an obvious egradation of organisation which has nothing to do with the influce of the environment . They are for instance naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest rank are vided and which belong to a system of reproduction that is no ger found in the birds nor in any of the animals of subsequent ks . In short they are essentially oviparous ; for the system truly viviparous animals , which is adapted to animals of the first k , is not found in the second nor does it again re-appear . Their tus is enclosed in an inorganic envelope ( the egg-shell ) and soon es communication with the mother and can develop without ing on her substance . The diaphragm , which among mammals completely separates somehat obliquely the chest from the abdomen , here ceases to exist , or nines very incomplete . The vertebrae of the neck and tail are the only mobile parts in the vertebral column of birds . Since movements of the other vertebrae that column are not necessary to the animal , they are not performed they thus place no obstacle to the large development of the sternum which now makes such movement almost impossible . The sternum of birds indeed gives attachment to the pectoral muscles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their energetic and almost continuous movements . The sternum has thus become extremely large and carinate in the middle . This , however , due to the habits of these animals and not to the general degradation that we are investigating . The truth of this is exemplified by fact that the mammal called a bat has also a carinate sternum . All the blood of birds passes through their lungs before reaching the other parts of the body . Thus they breathe exclusively by lungs // like the animals of the first rank ; and this is not the case with any known animal after them . We now come to a very strange peculiarity which is connected with the environment of these animals . They live more than other vertebrates in the air , and are almost continually rising into it and passing through it in every direction . They have adopted a habit of swelling their lungs with air in order to increase their volume and make themselves lighter ; and this habit has caused the organ to adhere to the sides of the chest so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , has had to pierce through the lung with its investing membranes and to penetrate every part of the body even to the inside of the great bones which are hollow , and to the quills of the large - feathers . ' It is , however , only in the lungs that the blood of birds undergoes the necessary influence of the air ; for the air which penetrates to the other parts of the body has another use than that of respiration . Thus the birds , which have been rightly placed after the mammals , exhibit an obvious degradation in their general organisation : not because their lung has a peculiarity not found among the former , for this is due like their feathers only to their acquired habit of launching themselves into the air ; but because they no longer have the system of reproduction proper to the most perfect animals , but only that which characterises most of the animals of the posterior classes . It is very difficult to ascertain among the birds themselves the degradation of organisation which we are now studying ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hence it has hitherto been a matter of convention which order should be placed at the head of this class and which at the end . We may reflect however that aquatic birds ( like the palmipeds ) , as also the waders and gallinaceans , have this advantage over all other birds that their young on coming out of the egg can walk and feed . We may pay special attention to the fact that among the palmipeds , the penguins and king-penguins , whose almost featherless wings are merely oars for swimming and of no use for flight , // thus approximate in some ways to the monotremes and cetaceans . We shall then recognise that the palmipeds , waders , and gallinaceans should constitute the first three orders of birds , and that the doves , passerines , birds of prey and climbers should form the last four orders of the class . Now , from what we know of the habits of the birds of these last four orders , we find that their young on coming out of the egg can neither walk nor feed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order of birds ; moreover , they are the only ones which have two posterior digits and two anterior . This character , which they possess in common with the chameleon , appears to justify us in placing them near the reptiles . REPTILES . Animals with only one ventricle in the heart and still possessing a pulmonary respiration though incomplete . Their skin is smooth or provided with scales . In the third rank are naturally and necessarily placed the reptiles ; and they will furnish us with new and stronger proofs of the degradation of organisation from one extremity of the animal chain to the ether , starting from the most perfect animals . In fact , their heart , which has only one ventricle , no longer displays that conformation hich belongs essentially to animals of the first and second ranks , and their blood is cold , almost like that of the animals of the posterior Ranks . We find another proof of the degradation of the organisation of reptiles their respiration . In the first place they are the last animals to eathe by true lungs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this nature in any of the succeeding classes , as I shall endeavour show when speaking of molluscs . Next , the lung has in their case wally very large chambers , proportionally less numerous , and is ready much simplified . In many species this organ is absent in oath and is then replaced by gills , a respiratory organ which is never found in animals of the anterior ranks . Sometimes the two kinds respiratory organs are present together in the same individual . ! tut the strongest proof of degradation in the respiration of reptiles that , only part of their blood passes through the lungs , while the rest idles the parts of the body without having undergone the influence respiration . Finally , among reptiles the four limbs essential to the most perfect mall begin to be lost , and indeed many of them ( nearly all the es ) lack them altogether . // Independently of the degradation of organisation indicated by the shape of the heart , by the temperature of the blood which scarcely arises above the level of the environment , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lung , it is found that reptiles differ considerably among themselves ; so that there are greater differences of organisation and external shape among the animals of the various orders of this class than among those of the two preceding classes . Some habitually live in the air , and of these , such as have no legs can only crawl ; others live in the water or on its banks , sometimes withdrawing into the water and sometimes going into open places . There are some that are clothed in scales and others that have a naked skin . Lastly , although they all have a heart with one ventricle , in some there are two auricles , while in others there is only one . All these differences are due to environment , manner of life , etc. ; conditions which doubtless act more strongly upon an organisation that is still remote from the goal to which nature is tending , than they could do on one more advanced towards perfection . Reptiles are oviparous animals ( including even those in which the eggs are hatched in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and usually very degraded ; their respiration and circulation are less perfect than those of mammals and birds ; and they all have a small brain which does not fill the cavity of the cranium . Hence they are less perfect than the animals of the two preceding classes , and in their turn confirm the fact that the degradation . of organisation increases , according as we approach the most imperfect animals . Within this class of animals themselves , independently of the modifications in their parts due to environment , we find in addition traces of the general degradation of organisation ; for in the last of their orders ( the batrachians ) the individuals , when they are first born , breathe by gills . If the absence of legs observed among snakes were regarded as a result of degradation , the ophidians ought to be the last order of reptiles ; but it would be a mistake to suppose this . The fact is that snakes are animals which for purposes of concealment have adopted the habit of crawling directly on the ground , and their body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its size . Now elongated legs would have impeded their efforts in crawling and concealing themselves ; while very short legs , of which there could only be four since these animals are vertebrates , would have been incapable of moving their body . Thus the habits of these animals have caused the disappearance of their legs ; although the batrachians. // which have legs , are more degraded in organisation and nearer to the fishes . The proofs of the important principle which I am stating will be based upon positive facts ; they will consequently always hold good in contact with the arguments that are brought against them . FISHES . Animals breathing by gills , with a smooth or scaly skin ; the body provided with fins . On following the course of that degradation undergone by organisation as a whole and of the diminution in the number of animal faculties , we see that the fishes must of necessity be placed in the fourth rank , that is , after the reptiles . Their organisation in fact is even less vanced towards perfection than is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most perfect animals . It is true no doubt that their general shape , the absence of a constriction between the head and body to form a neck , and the various fins which for them take the place of limbs , are results of the influence of the dense medium they inhabit , and not of the degradation of organisation . But that degradation is none the less real and very great , as we may convince ourselves by an examination of their internal organs ; so that we are forced to assign to fishes a lower rank than to reptiles . We no longer find in them the respiratory organ of the most perfect animals ; for they have no true lung , and in its place have only gills or vascular pectinate folds arranged on both sides of the neck or head , four altogether on each side . The water which these animals breathe goes in by the mouth , passes between the folds of the gills , and bathes numerous vessels which run there . Now since the water is mixed air or contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the blood of the gills and there achieves the function of respiration . The water then issues through open holes on either of the neck . Note that this is the last time that the respired fluid enters by the animal 's mouth in order to reach the organ of respiration . These animals , like those of the posterior ranks , have no trachea or larynx or true voice ( including even those called grondeurs 1 ) eyelids , etc . These organs and faculties are here lost and are not in found throughout the animal kingdom . Yet the fishes are still part of the division of vertebrate animals ; 1 The Grey Gurnard . H.E. // but they are the last of them and they terminate the fifth stage of organisation , being in common with reptiles the only animals which have : A vertebral column ; Nerves , terminating in a brain , which does not fill the cranium ; A heart with one ventricle ; Warm blood ; Lastly , a completely internal ear , Fishes thus display an oviparous reproduction ; a body without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are not all invariably analogous with the four limbs of the most perfect animals ; a very incomplete skeleton curiously modified and rudimentary in the last animals of this class ; only one ventricle in the heart and cold blood ; gills instead of lungs ; a very small brain ; the sense of touch incapable of giving knowledge of the shapes of bodies ; and apparently without any sense of smell , for odours are only conveyed by air . It is clear that these animals strongly confirm in their turn also the degradation of organisation that we have undertaken to follow throughout the animal kingdom . We shall now see that fishes are primarily divided into what are called bony fishes , which are the most perfect of them , and cartilaginous fishes , which are the least perfect . These two facts confirm the degradation of organisation within the class itself ; for among the cartilaginous fishes the softness and cartilaginous condition of the parts intended to stiffen their bodies and aid their movements indicate that it is among them that the skeleton ends or rather that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order of nature in the inverse direction , the eight last genera of this class should include the fishes whose branchial apertures have no operculum or membrane and are nothing but holes at the sides or under the throat ; finally the lampreys and hag-fishes should terminate the class , for these fishes differ greatly from all others by the imperfection of their skeleton and in having a naked slimy body without lateral fins , etc . OBSERVATIONS ON THE VERTEBRATES . The vertebrate animals , although differing greatly from one another as regards their organs , appear to be all formed on a common plan of organisation . On passing from the fishes to the mammals , we find that this plan becomes more perfect from class to class and that it only reaches completion in the most perfect mammals ; but we may also notice that this plan while approaching perfection has undergone numerous modifications , some of them very large , through the influence of the environment of the animals and of the habits which each            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
