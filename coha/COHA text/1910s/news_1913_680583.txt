txt SPRINKLING WELL DONE . Fifth Avenue Merchants Willing to Pay Private Company . Merchants and property owners on Fifth Avenue do not pay for any Street sprinkling because no sprinkling is done by the Street Cleaning Department . The streets certainly are alternately dry and wet , otherwise they would not be sprinkled at all , and that the sprinkling is unsatisfactorily done can hardly be the case , because hundreds of property owners subscribe to this service yearly . Taxpayers are not compelled to pay a tribute to any concern for this work . because there is no appropriation for the purpose , and the Street Cleaning Department lays no burden on the taxpayers , as there Is no departmental provision made for it . As to the work being done in a haphazard . faulty manner , to use Mr. Friedma n't words , " anybody with eyes can see " that the streets are sprinkled regularly every day . most of them being gone over at least three times daily , and this service Is far from being unsatisfactory or haphazard .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
