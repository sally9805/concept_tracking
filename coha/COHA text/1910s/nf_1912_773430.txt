txt William the Silent , the Prince of Orange ; in England Elizabeth , daughter of Henry VIII , who , during the reign of her sister Mary , was the hope of the English Protestants . In the war , many diverging interests were about to engage . The Dutch desired liberty , England her independence , the cities of France their ancient communal rights , and provincial feudalism its former privileges . But the religions form , which was that of the times , covered all . When we survey the whole from the heights of the Vatican or the Escurial , we recognize the fact that the chief aim pursued in Western Europe during the second half of the sixteenth century was the triumph of the Church , as constituted by the Council of Trent , and the triumph of the king of Spain , her military chief . France , Battlefield of the Two Parties . The First War ( 1562-1563 ) .  --  - The contract , entered into by the two kings at Chateau Cambresis , had immediately been put into execution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the edict of Ecouen threatened the Protestants with death . In Spain Philip II had autosda-fe celebrated in his presence , in order to show the provincial governors that they must grant no mercy to heretics . At Naples and Milan all suspected persons perished . Even the archbishop of Toledo was persecuted for his opinions . Sanguinary edicts spread the terror to the Netherlands , where the creation of new bishoprics notified the population of a stricter surveillance . This declaration of war against heresy was answered as early as 1559 , by acts of the English Parliament , which recognized Elizabeth as the supreme head of the Anglican Church ; by the secularization of all the bishoprics of Brandenburg ; and by the suppression of the religious and military Order of the Sword Bearers of Livonia . Thus did the Reformation consolidate and extend from the Irish Sea to the recesses of the Baltic , despite the thunders of Rome and the threats of two mighty kings . It even tried to win France by the plot of Amboise , which came near success , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . In vain did a great magistrate , L'H6pital , preach moderation and tolerance to those furious men who listened only to their passions . The massacre of Protestants at Vassy ( 1562 ) inaugurated a war which only ended thirty-six years later . During this time France was the principal battlefield of the two parties . The atrocious character of the war was evident from the very beginning of hostilities . As soon as Philip 11 learned that the sword had been drawn , he sent to the south , to Montlue , " the Catholic butcher , " 3000 of his best soldiers and directed others from the Netherlands upon Paris . At the same time the German Protestants gave 7000 men to Conde , to whom Elizabeth also dispatched reinforcements and money . The defeat of this prince at 1 ) reux and the death of the Duke of Guise , who was assassinated before Orleans , restored influence to the advocates of peace . Catherine de Medici granted to the Protestants the edict of Amboise ( 1563 ) . Its principal clauses will be found again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a proof of the uselessness of those thirty-six years of murder , ravage , and conflagration . Catholicism in the Netherlands and in France ( 1564-1568 ) . The Blood Tribunal ( 1567 ) . - The edict of Amboise irritated Spain and Rome . Pius V , who had been grand inquisitor before he became Pope , reproached Catherine for her weakness . During a journey which she made in the south Philip II sent to meet her at Bayonne the most pitiless of his lieutenants , the Duke of Alva , who informed the queen of the policy of his master , which consisted in ridding himself of hostile leaders by assassination . This doubtless was the germ whence the subsequent massacre of Saint Bartholomew developed . The Jesuits were spreading everywhere and were everywhere preparing the way for a mortal combat with heresy . This time it was in the Netherlands that the fire broke out and thence spread to France . The Spaniards poured into the Netherlands . They introduced the despotic spirit among a people whose municipal life had always been very strong . The publication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal for insurrection . The nobles , threatened with the loss of their religious and political liberty , bound themselves by the Compromise of Breda ( 1566 ) to lend each other mutual aid in obtaining the redress of their grievances . The people among whom the Reformation had already made great progress flung themselves with the blind fury of mobs upon the churches , broke the images of the saints , overthrew the altars , and burned the pulpits . Shocked at these demagogical excesses the nobles held aloof , and the revolt , thus isolated , calmed down at once . But Philip decided to make an example . He sent to the Low Countries the Duke of Alva , who instituted the Tribunal of Blood . Eighteen thousand persons perished on the scaffold , among whom were the counts Horn and Egmont . Thirty thousand persons were stripped of their property , 100,000 emigrated , and a ruinous tax destroyed the fortunes of those who remained . These events found their echo in France , where the second civil war broke out ( 1567 ) , marked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil war ( 1568 ) , where Italians hired by Pius V , Spaniards dispatched by the Duke of Alva , and Catholic Germans fought against the Protestants of all countries . At Jarnac Conde was slain , and at Moncontour Coligny was defeated . Thus the victory remained with the Catholics . In France , Catherine resolved to sign the Peace of Saint Germain ( 1570 ) that she might gain time to devise " something else . " In the Netherlands the Catholic triumph was apparently complete , and preparations were carried on for an invasion of England , where since 1563 Spanish gold had been cleverly employed to keep up the agitation . In Spain every attempt to escape from religious and political tyranny was mercilessly repressed . The wrath of the king hung over all . He drove his son to suicide , his wife to death , and the Moors of the Alpujarras to revolt . He established the Inquisition in the Spanish colonies , and from one end to the other of his dominions silence and terror reigned . During this period Catholicism suffered only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall of Mary Stuart ( 1568 ) assured the victory in Scotland to the followers of the Reformation . Dispersion of the Forces of Spain . Battle of Lepanto ( 1571 ) . ? Meanwhile the forces of Spain were being dispersed in all directions . Much money was expended and many soldiers were employed . In Andalusia they fought the Moors who , supported by England , resisted until 1571 . On the Mediterranean they fought the Ottomans , whose progress continued and who conquered ( . Cyrus in 1570 . In the Netherlands they fought the Gueux or " beggars , " who along the coast and at the mouth of the rivers intercepted the Spanish vessels , prevented the provisioning of the strongholds and thus inspired uneasiness in one party and hope in the other . At Naples , at Milan , on the coast of Africa , in the colonies , in Mexico , in Peru , everywhere , , strong garrisons were required and Spain drained herself of men to maintain her domination of the world . The only honorable war carried on was that against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1558 a squadron and army sent against Tlemcen were destroyed . In the following year 15,000 soldiers on 200 vessels tried to capture Tripoli and suffered a frightful disaster . Four years later , the fleet of Naples was overwhelmed by a tempest . In 1565 Suleiman , who had already wrested Rhodes from the Knights , besieged them in Malta , but was repulsed by their Grand Master , La Valette . These efforts of the Ottomans to render themselves masters of the whole Mediterranean forced Philip II to direct a large proportion of his resources against them . After the loss of Cyprus he got together 300 ships manned by 80,000 soldiers and rowers , and his natural brother , Don Juan of Austria , won the famous but useless victory of Lepanto ( 1571 ) . Catholic Conspiracies in England and France. ? Such expenditure of men and money rendered Philip unable to interfere in the affairs of France and England except by plots . The victory of Lepanto encouraged the Catholics . The Duke of Norfolk vainly tried to overthrow Elizabeth and enthrone Mary Stuart , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t h e massacre of Saint Bartholomew . When Darnley , the husband of Mary Stuart , was murdered by the Earl of Bothwell ( 1567 ) and the queen married the assassin , all Scotland rose against her . Mary took refuge with Elizabeth , who treated her as a prisoner ( 1.568 ) . The expiation of such injustice began almost immediately , and England thenceforth was constantly agitated by Catholic plots to deliver the captive . Philip pensioned the English Catholics , who had fled to the continent . He threw open to their priests the seminaries of Flanders , so as to hold the British coast under the perpetual menace of an invasion more formidable than that of an army of soldiers . In 1569 the Pope excommunicated Elizabeth . Thereupon many lords got together a little army , which had as its standard a picture of Jesus Christ with his five bleeding wounds . In the following year a fresh rebellion was repressed like the first . A third unsuccessful attempt was made in 1572 by the Duke of Norfolk , to whom Mary Stuart had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus in England Protestantism made a victorious defense . In France it seemed on the point of perishing . After the peace of Saint Germain Admiral Coligny gained great influence over the mind of the king , the young Charles IX . I4e wished to lead the French Protestants against the Spaniards in the Netherlands , and thus by one stroke end the civil wars in France , and commence a national war against the foreigner . The execution of this sagacious plan was in preparation , when a professional assassin in the pay of the house of Guise severely wounded the admiral . The king was finally persuaded to order a general massacre of the Protestants on Saint Bartholomew 's day , August 24 , 1572 . The unsuspecting victims were butchered by thousands . For this abominable crime the king received warm congratulations from the courts of Rome and Spain . " Be fully assured , ? Philip II wrote , " that in furthering thus the affairs of God , you are furthering your own still more . " This is the countersign of that // atrocious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of piety . Progress of Protestantism ( 1572-1587 ) . ? Protestantism , mutilated and bleeding , rose up stronger than ever . Despite the loss of its most experienced captains and most valiant soldiers , the Calvinist party rushed to arms after the massacre of Saint Bartholomew and at the peace of La Rochelle enforced the recognition of its right to liberty of conscience . That political crime of August 24 was therefore , as always happens , useless . When Henry III , a man of distinguished ability , but of corrupt heart , succeeded Charles IX in 1574 , he found himself face to face with three parties which he was incapable of controlling : the politicians , headed by his youngest brother , Francois d'Alencon ; the Calvinist , who recognized as their leader Henry of Warn , king of Navarre ; and the enthusiastic Catholics , whom Henry of Guise organized into the faction of the league , and who opposed both the king and the Huguenots . Unimportant wars and treaties carry us to the year 1584 , when the Duke of Alencon died . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navarre , the leader of the Protestants , became heir presumptive to the crown . In the war of the three Henrys he consecrated his rights by the brilliant victory of Coutras ( 1587 ) . Thus it seemed that the religious wars in France were on the point of elevating a heretic to the throne of Saint Louis , in spite of the excommunication of the Pope , who had declared Henry of Navarre unworthy to succeed to the crown . In the Netherlands , there was likewise Protestant success . After having long carried on a piratical war which effected nothing , the Gueux undertook war on land which might lead to some result . In 1572 they seized Briel , and the two provinces of Holland and Zealand immediately took up arms . Supported by the Protestants of Germany , England , and France , aided by the nature of their country intersected by canals , above all commanded by William of Nassau , Prince of Orange , who was surnamed the Silent despite his eloquence and who understood quite as well as Coligny , his father-in-law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurgents defended themselves with success . Violence having failed , Philip wished to try mildness and replaced the Duke of Alva . But the army , left without pay and without provisions , sacked the principal cities . The general irritation gave rise to the confederation of Ghent ( 1576 ) , which united for a time all the Netherlands against the Spanish rule . Unfortunately this union could not long be maintained between the ten Walloon provinces , or modern Belgium , which were manufacturing and Catholic , and the seven Batavian provinces , or modern Holland , which were commercial and Calvinistic . Opposition of interests and beliefs was bound to bring about opposition of political views . In 1579 in fact the Walloons , by the treaty of Maastricht , recognized Philip II as their king . On the other hand the northern provinces made a closer union at Utrecht , and constituted themselves a republic , with William of Orange as stadtholder or governor general . Two years later the States General of The Hague , the federal capital of the United Provinces , solemnly sep- , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Philip II had forfeited all authority in the Netherlands . The king set a price on the head of William the Silent . A rascal , who wished to earn this reward , murdered the stadtholder ( 1584 ) , but the liberty of the United Provinces no longer hung upon the life of one man . The Dutch understood how to defend their independence , even against the skillful Farnese Duke of Parma . They were also aided by England , which in 1585 sent them 6000 men , and by France , whither the duke was twice obliged to go to the succor of the League , and where in his second journey he died . Thus the war undertaken by the Catholics in the Netherlands resulted in the establishment of a new people among the nations . England and Spain had not yet grappled in hand to hand combat . But Elizabeth was sending to all the enemies of Philip II arms , soldiers , and money , and by means of bold corsairs was carrying on a disastrous war against Spanish commerce . Drake in 1577 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , captured many // ships , and after making the circuit of the globe returned at the end of three years with immense booty . Cavendish in 1585 devastated the Spanish establishments for the second time , while the Dutch laid waste those of Portugal , which had become a province of Spain . The king could not revenge himself , because his two enemies then had no trading posts or commerce , and there were no vulnerable points outside their territory where he could strike them . Thus against Elizabeth he saw no weapon but conspiracy . The cruel situation created for English Catholics by the queen rendered this easy . In one year 200 persons were beheaded , for the Protestants practiced toleration no more than their adversaries , and on both sides they defended heaven by torture or assassination . A final attempt to kill the queen of England decided her to send Mary Stuart to the scaffold ( 1587 ) . With the head of the niece of the Guises fell all the hopes of a Catholic restoration in Great Britain . Defeat of Spain and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanquished in the Netherlands and in England and menaced in France , resolved upon a supreme effort . As early as 1584 the Guises had treated with Philip II and infused fresh life into the League . He himself exhausted all the resources of his states to organize an army and a fleet strong enough to bring back the Netherlands and England , and after them France , to the Catholic faith , and subject them to the law of Spain . On June 3 , 1588 , the invincible Armada issued from the Tagus . It was to land in England an army of 50,000 men . Storms and the English and Flemish sailors with their fire-ships , in one of the decisive encounters of all human history , got the better of this arrogant expedition . The plan , over which Philip II had toiled for five years and upon which he had meditated for eighteen , was utterly shipwrecked in the space of a few days . At the moment when Philip believed that his Armada was carrying him back victorious to London , Guise , his best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whence the king escaped as a fugitive . But the Spanish fleet once destroyed , Henry III began to hope again . // Ile enticed Henry of Guise to Blois , where he had him murdered . Then joining the heretic king of Navarre , he returned to lay siege to his capital . A monk assassinated him in his camp ( 1589 ) . The Huguenot Henry of Navarre was immediately proclaimed king of France as Henry IV . Though many Catholics abandoned him , 7000 English , 10,000 Dutch , and 12,000 Germans came to his help , which permitted him to hold his own against the Spaniards and Italians who had hastened to the aid of the League . The battles of Arques and of I vry confirmed his fortune and his renown ( 1590 ) . Twice the Duke of Parma endeavored to capture Paris and Rouen ( 1591 ) . But demagogic excesses , the general lassitude , and the imprudence of Philip IT , who demanded of the States General of 1593 the crown of France for his daughter Isabella , the promised bride of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Soon afterward he abjured Protestantism at Saint Denis , " because Paris was well worth a mass , " and was generally accepted as king ( 1593 ) . The League had no longer any reason to exist . It retarded but could not prevent the triumph of Henry IV . Brissac sold him Paris when he expelled the Spanish garrison . A few months later papal absolution consecrated his rights even in the eyes of the leaguers . The chiefs were then compelled to acknowledge him . The Duke of Guise yielded , as did also Villars , Braneas , and Mayenne . But all made him pay for their submission . A brief war with Spain , signalized by the battle of Fontaine Francaise and the siege of Amiens , brought about the peace of Vervins , which reestablished the boundaries of the two kingdoms , on the footing of the treaty of Chateau Cambresis . Three weeks earlier Henry IV had assured peace at home by signing the edict of Nantes , which guaranteed the Protestants liberty of conscience , freedom of worship in their castles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the parliaments of the south , and places of surety . Lastly , they were accorded the right of assembling by deputies , every three years , to present their complaints to the government ( 1598 ) . Thus they constituted a state within the state . RESULTS OF THE RELIGIOUS WARS IN WESTERN EUROPE Decline and Ruin of Spain. ? There is no greater moral lesson in history than that afforded by the reign of Philip II . This man , for the sake of ruling the human will and conscience , devoted to his ambition apparently inexhaustible resources , and an energy that flinched at nothing . Everything seemed legitimate to his mind , devoured by a double fanaticism , at once political and religious . In the task which the Pope and the king pursued in common , the Church was far more the instrument than the end , for Catholic restoration was to result in the consolidation of Spanish supremacy . And when to attain his object Philip II had shed torrents of blood , he found that he had slain neither heresy nor popular liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peninsula . Commerce and industry , which had been cruelly attacked by the expulsion of the Jews and Moors , were still further affected by the monopolies which the government set up . Agriculture was succumbing under the periodical ravages of the flocks of the Mesta . The population , decimated by war and emigration , was also diminished by the multiplication of convents . For all these reasons labor decreased and the country was forced to purchase abroad what it could no longer produce . Thus the gold of America traversed Spain without rendering it fruitful and flowed rapidly towards the productive nations . This explains the astonishing fact that the possessor of the richest deposits of metals in the world was twice obliged ( 1575 and 1596 ) to suspend payment , and that he left a debt of over $200,000,000 . Men had not yet learned that real wealth does not exist in the gold which represents it , but in the labor which creates it . Philip II died in 1598 , four months after the edict of // Nantes and the treaty of Vervins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strengthening of his two great adversaries , Henry IV and Elizabeth , on the thrones which they had gloriously reconquered or preserved . A century later the Marquis de Torey said : " Spain is a body without a soul . " We have seen that Italy shared the fate of Spain . Prosperity of England and Holland. ? The perils from internal conspiracies and foreign war , which England had just escaped , permitted Elizabeth to finish the work of the Tudors by constituting the most absolute royalty which ever existed in the land . As head of the Church she persecuted the Non-Conformists with cruelty . In order that she might more effectively reach their adversaries , the Anglicans delivered over to her the public liberties . The jury was nearly suppressed . In Parliament not a voice dared raise itself against the ministers . " In the trials for high treason which were instituted on the slightest pretext , the courts of justice differed little from regular caverns of assassins . " This is what the War of the Roses , the Reformation , and religious hatreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution was in secret preparation , which was to break out against the second successor of Elizabeth . At least she had developed all the sources of national wealth for her country by favoring commerce and the marine ; by the creation of the Exchange in London ; by the colonization of Virginia , whence were brought the potato and tobacco ; by the immigration into England of the Flemish who fled from Spanish tyranny , and caused their adopted country to profit by their industrial and commercial skill . Under Queen Elizabeth lived one of the greatest dramatic poets of the world , Shakespeare , and a philosopher , Bacon , who brought about a salutary revolution in the sciences by effecting the final adoption of the experimental method . The Dutch , while defending against Philip II their half-submerged land , had already become the carriers of the oeean and the harvesters of the sea . They bartered their tons of herrings for tons of gold , by proRELIGIOUS // visioning with salted viands the Catholic countries where the practice of fasting rendered such food a necessity . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ florins as their share of the taxes . Moreover they carried on an enormous commission trade , taking merchandise where it was cheap and transporting it where it was needed . Philip II closed Lisbon to them . Therefore they sought their Oriental wares at the places of production , and by the conquest of the Moluccas laid the foundations of a colonial empire which the great East India Company , organized in 1602 , developed and strengthened . The two provinces of Holland and Zealand alone possessed 70,000 sailors , through whose hands the entire commerce of Spain and Portugal was destined to pass . Reorganization of France by Henry IV ( 1598-1610 ) . - Henry IV , by the treaty of Vervins and the edict of Nantes , gave France peace at home and abroad . The country 's wounds remained to be healed . The finances were in the most deplorable state . The public debt amounted to almost 1,300,000,000 francs and the income was barely 30,000,000 a year . Henry IV chose for superintendent of the finances the soldier Sully , the faithful comrade of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers disgorge . He himself verified the product of the imposts and fixed then at only a proper amount . In less than a dozen years , although the taxes had been reduced by 4,000,000 , the public service was assured , 147,000,000 of debts had been paid , 8,000,000 worth of domains redeemed , and a surplus of 20,000,000 placed in reserve in the vaults of the Bastile . " Tillage and pasturage , " said Sully , " are the two breasts which nourish France . They are the real mines and treasures of Peru . " Therefore he decreed the draining of marshes , prohibited the destruction of the forests , and permitted the free exportation of grain . Tax collectors were forbidden to seize the beasts or instruments of tillage . And lastly , Olivier de Serres , a great scientific agriculturist , popularized by his works the true maxims of rural culture and economy . Sully despised manufactures , but the king , who was less exclusive , had 50,000 mulberry trees planted and revived the factories of Lyons , Nimes , and Tours , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pottery at Nevers and Paris , concluded treaties of commerce with Holland and England , restored to France the monopoly of commerce in the East , and had Champlain build the city of Quebec in Canada ( 1608 ) . Henry IV longed to restore peace to Europe as he had restored it to France . He conceived the plan of a grand confederation of European states , with a diet to settle international differences . With this aim in view , he was about to begin a war with Austria and had already taken the field with 40,000 men , to determine the succession of Cleves and Juliers , when the dagger of Ravaillac ended his life and saved Austria ( 1610 ) . Such were the results of the formidable enterprise directed by the papacy and Spain against the modern spirit which was awakening . The independence of Europe was saved . Toleration had won its first victory and liberty of the mind could begin . A new state , the United Provinces , was about to treat on terms of equality with the most glorious kings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her future greatness . France was placed by a great prince at the head of Europe . Spain , in conclusion , fell from the hands of Philip II , exhausted and agonizing ; and the Roman Inquisition made of Italy for three centuries the land of the dead . THE RELIGIOUS WARS IN CENTRAL EUROPE , OR THE THIRTY YEARS ' WAR ( 1018-1645 ) Preliminaries of the Thirty Years ' War ( 1555-1618 ) . ? The struggle of ultramontanism against the Reformation after the Catholic restoration effected by the Council of Trent and the papacy , broke out first in Western Europe . Vanquished in France , the Netherlands , EngRELIGIOUS // land , and Scotland , and constrained to submit to the edict of toleration proclaimed at Nantes in 1598 , ultramontanism attempted twenty years later to regain Germany and the countries of the North . The first war had lasted thirty-six years and covered with ruins all the lands situated between the Pyrenees and the North Sea . The second lasted thirty years ( 1618-1648 ) and extended its ravages from the Danube to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Baltic , destroying cities , ruining nations , decimating the population , and bringing back barbarism . Men employed twothirds of a century in murdering each other in the name of the God of charity and love . When Charles V , fallen from the height of his hopes , resolved to abdicate , he first promulgated the peace of Augsburg . This could be only a truce , because it contained an ecclesiastical reservation which forbade any holder of a benefice on becoming a Protestant to retain any church property which he had formerly held . Moreover Lutheranism had split up into a multitude of sects which interpreted differently the question of grace . The universities of Jena , Wittenberg , and Leipzig excommunicated each other in turn , and in the midst of this confusion the Duke of Saxony , a temporal sovereign , arrogated the right of dictating a creed and of expelling or imprisoning all infringers thereof . In 1580 the followers of the Reformation in Saxony and Brandenburg signed a " formula of concord , " to which the three electors and a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which other states of northern Germany rejected . In conclusion , the separation was so profound between the Lutherans and the Calvinists , that the former allowed the Catholics to deprive of his electorate Gebhard von Truehsess , archbishop of Cologne , who had become a Calvinist ( 1583 ) . These quarrels permitted the Catholics to regain ground , thanks to the cleverness of the Jesuits , who from Bavaria , their headquarters in Germany , extended their action to a distance . They caused the Protestants of Aix-la-Chapelle to be expelled , the republic of Donauwerth to be degraded from its rank as an imperial city , and prevented a reformer from becoming bishop of Strasburg . Thus the plan of a Catholic restoration was being carried out in Germany . The uneasy Protestants drew together and formed the Evangelical Union ( 1608 ) . To this their adversaries opposed the Catholic League , the direction of which Austria under feeble princes abandoned to Maximilian , Duke of Bavaria . The succession to Cleves , Berg , and Juliers ( 1609 ) came near setting Europe aflame . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Elector of Brandenburg . When the emperor sequestered the duchies , the Protestants complained and Henry IV was about to uphold them when he died by assassination ( 1610 ) . The contention was prolonged . Neuburg became Catholic ; Brandenburg , Calvinist . The Spaniards entered the country from one side and the Dutch from the other . At that moment the policy of Austria was changed by the accession of Ferdinand II , an energetic prince , who blew up with gunpowder the heretical churches in his states and on one occasion burned 10,000 Bibles . Palatine Period ( 1618-1625 ) . ? The Bohemians , whose privileges he had violated , rose in revolt and chose Frederick , the elector palatine , son-in-law of the king of England , as their king ( 1618 ) . Thus , just a century after the outbreak of the Reformation , began a struggle which repeated in Central Europe what we have already seen in the west ; namely , a political war under the mask of a war for religion . Ferdinand II in fact was determined to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to redound to his personal profit and to render Germany an Austrian province . Frederick was a Calvinist . Hence the Lutherans deserted him , while the Spaniards on the contrary made common cause with the Austrians and their allies . When the battle of White Mountain , won by the forces of the League , delivered Bohemia to Ferdinand II , he committed abominable cruelties . Two centuries later the country still showed the effects of this sanguinary restoration of Catholicism . The proscribed Bohemians were formed into an army by Count von Mansfeld and Christian of Brunswick . They long held in check the Bavarian General Tilly and the Spaniards of the Netherlands who had come to his help . Danish Period ( 1625-1629 ) . - The Protestant ; princes had time to penetrate the designs of Ferdinand and call in the kings of the North , whom the defeat of the German Reformers would leave exposed to the blows of Austria . Christian IV , king of Denmark , was the first to enter the lists ( 1625 ) and occupied the country between the Elbe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Catholic League in that direction , in his rear an adventurer called Wallenstein was bringing to the emperor , who had no army , 50,000 men and later 100,000 , who lived by pillage and whose leader reserved for himself the absolute command . Routed by Tilly at Lutter , and threatened by Wallenstein with being cut off from HoLstein , the Danish king retreated to his peninsula and signed the peace of Liibeck ( 1629 ) . Then northern Germany , despoiled by the edict of restitution and occupied by 100,000 Imperialists , bowed its head before the Austrian power . Wallenstein said openly " that no more princes or electors were needed in Germany ; that everything there ought to be subject to a single king , as in France and Spain . " The French Cardinal Richelieu thwarted this plan . He sent secret emissaries , to arouse the jealousy and the courage of the princes . At the Diet of Hatisbon , he persuaded them to demand the recall of Wallenstein , who was crushing Germany with his requisitions , and to refuse the title of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the same time , he induced Poland and Sweden to conclude a peace , so that the king of the latter , already so renowned under the name of Gustavus Adolphus , might be free to hasten to the succor of the Reformers . Swedish Period ( 1630-1635 ) . - That great captain took alarm when he saw Catholicism and the Austrians obtaining a foothold on the shores of the Baltic . He disembarked in Pomerania ( 1630 ) with 16,000 admirably disciplined men . France could not join him in offensive alliance . But at least she promised him an annual subsidy of 400,000 crowns . When he had conquered l'ornerania , he made his way into Saxony , defeated ' filly at Leipzig ( 1631 ) , and expelled all the Catholic or Spanish garrisons from Franconia , Suabia , the Upper Rhine , and the Palatinate , while the Elector of Saxony invaded Lusatia and Bohemia . Having thus separated the Imperialists and the Spaniards , he entered Bavaria and forced the passage of the Lech , where Tilly was slain . But the emperor had recalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon Saxony , and forced Gustavus to come to its defense . The Swedish king won at Lutzen his last victory , and died in his triumph ( 1632 ) . Skillful generals , his pupils , took his place at the head of the armies . The chancellor Oxenstiern succeeded him in the eouncil . Ferdinand made their task easier by assassinating Wallenstein , of whose ambition he was afraid ( 1634 ) . But that same year the defeat of Bernard of Saxe-Weimar at Nordlingen deprived Sweden of all her German allies except the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel ; and Richelieu considered it necessary to set the armies of France in motion at last . French Period ( 1635-1648 ) . - At first he was unfortunate . The Spaniards crossed the Somme and took possession of Corbie . The court and Paris had a moment of terror . But Richelieu averted the danger , reconquered Corbie , and imposed victory upon his generals under pain of death . La Meilleraye and Chatillon captured Arras ( 1640 ) . Bernard of Saxe-Weimar , bought by Richelieu , conquered Alsace , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to France . D'Ilarcourt won three victories in Piedmont , which was then the ally of the Spaniards . The king himself marched to take possession of Perpignan , which is still French . In order to give Spain occupation at home , Richelieu encouraged revolts in Catalonia and Portugal . The Swedish generals Banner and Torstenson completed the Freneh successes in the west by victories in Brandenburg , Silesia , and Saxony . Guebriant , triumphant at Wolfenbiittel and at Kempen ( 1641-1642 ) , was effecting // his junction with the Swedes , so as to hurl their combined forces upon exhausted Austria , when Richelieu died ( 1643 ) . his death emboldened the Spaniards , who invaded France . Conde routed them at Rocroi ( 1643 ) , at Fribourg ( 1644 ) , at Nordlingen ( 1645 ) , and lastly at Lens ( 1648 ) . Thus the conclusion of the peace of Westphalia was compelled .

Since she was vanquished , whatever she had wished to overthrow still existed . The princes enjoyed full liberty of conscience . Their subjects possessed it only under many restrictions ; for in each state one religion dominated , either Catholic , Lutheran , or Calvinist . No other religious organizations were recognized . These three obtained equality of rights . As to the possession of ecclesiastical property and the exercise of worship , everything was restored in Germany to the condition of 1624 , except in the Palatinate , which was set back to the year 1618 . Thus the territorial acquisitions and conversions , effected since the peace of Augsburg in 1555 , were recognized . In order to indemnify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Two princes of the Church had been the instruments to defeat ultramontanism and the papacy . It was a proof that politics were no longer based upon creed ; , and that temporal interests must henceforth depend solely on themselves . Political Independence of the German States. ? When Wallenstein was pressing upon Germany with his immense army and when Ferdinand II was distributing to his kinsmen the spoils of the princes , one might have thought that the dream of Otho the Great , of Frederick Barbarossa , and of Charles V was being realized , and that the unity of the empire was assured under the absolute authority of the emperor . France and the Swedes dispelled this dream . The German princes and states were assured the right of suffrage in the Diet on questions of alliance , war , treaty , and new laws . They were confirmed in the full and entire exercise of sovereignty in their territory . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided that it was not against the emperor or the empire . Thus the imperial authority was only a title and Germany henceforth formed not a state , but a confederation . For a long time Switzerland and Holland had been foreign to the empire . This separation in fact was formally recognized . Acquisitions of Sweden and France. ? The victors lacked moderation . Sweden caused such territories to be ceded her as placed in her hands the mouths of the three great German rivers , the Oder , Elbe , and Weser . These were useless acquisitions , because she could not keep them . They were dangerous acquisitions , because tempting her to interfere in continental wars , whereby she was to lose her good fortune . France retained Pignerol in Piedmont , that is to say , a door open upon Italy ; also Alsace , a precious possession , and beyond the Rhine Vieux Brisach and Philipsburg , where she had the right to keep a garrison .

Thus the French had on the west , like the Swedes on the north , an offensive position . Germany , divided into four or five hundred states , Lutheran and Catholic , monarchical and republican . secular and ecclesiastical , was of necessity to become the theater of every intrigue and the battleground of Europe . Such , from the same causes , her divisions and anarchy , had been the condition of Italy at the beginning of modern times . If the Bourbons had not inherited the ambition of the Hapsburgs and stirred up against themselves the same coalitions , the peace of Westphalia would have constituted the grandeur of France and the political liberty of Europe . RICHELIEU AND MAZARIN . COMPLETION OF MONARCHICAL FRANCE ( 1610-1661 ) Minority of Louis XIII ( 1610-1617 ) . ?

Richelieu had the genius to continue the work of Louis XI , of Francis I , and of Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years which came near reversing their gains . The feeble regent , Marie de Medici , abandoned both the foreign and domestic policy of Henry IV . Her favorite Coneini alienated the nobles , who revolted in order to force her to purchase their submission by offices and pensions . Then , to disguise their covetousness as a desire for the public welfare , they exacted the convocation of the States General , the last which was convoked before the French Revolution . At this assembly the Third Estate or the Commons showed a remarkable appreciation of the needs of the country . The nobility displayed its insulting contempt for the people , and the court its disdain for reforms . A second rebellion headed by Conde was appeased by bribes to the leaders . Finally Concini was killed and his wife burned alive on accusation of having bewitched the queen mother . Louis XIII and his favorite , the Duke de Luynes , governed no better . The nobles now rebelled in behalf of the mother against the son . A more serious war broke out in 1621 . Incensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the reformers had seized , the Protestants revolted . They planned to found in the marshes of Aunis a French Holland , of which La Rochelle was to be the Amsterdam . De Luynes , who had appointed himself Constable of France , laid siege to Montauban . He failed and was himself carried off ' by a fever . The king succeeded the following year in expelling Soubise from the Isle of Re and the Protestants sued for peace . The treaty of Montpellier confirmed the edict of Nantes , granted them La Rochelle and Montauban as cities of refuge , but forbade their holding any public meeting without the king 's authorization . , Richelieu humbles the Protestants and the High Nobility. ? Richelieu was raised to the ministry ( 1624 ) by the reviving influence of Marie de Medici . He resumed the grand policy of Louis XI and Henry IV . His twofold object was at home to destroy the power of the nobility and the independence of the Protestants , and abroad to humble the house of Austria . Like Louis XI he began too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his different enemies in succession . Two treaties with the Protestants and Spain enabled him to turn all his forces against the nobles , whom , he smote with terrible sentences . Marshal d'Ornano was thrown into the Bastile ; the Count de Chalais was beheaded as a conspirator ; Bouteville , Montmorency , and the Marquis de Beuvron were executed for dueling . At the same time the terrible cardinal deprived the nobles of the high dignities which gave them too much influence . The office of constable was abolished and that of grand admiral was brought in . These acts of severity made the nobles pause . Richelieu found himself free to end with the French Protestants who were upheld by England , although by marrying Henrietta of France to the English king , Charles I , he had flattered himself that he could prevent any such alliance . La Rochelle was besieged . An immense dike closed the port to the English fleets . After RICHELIEU : I. U .11 .

No sooner was La Rochelle subdued than the gr-U-deeM formed about the king a cabal led by Marie d , ? Medici , who did not find her former confessor , Richelieu , suf ficiently docile . When common rumor reported him fallen in disgrace , a final interview with Louis X I restored to him all his influence . The victims of that . " Day of Dupes " were Marshal de Marillac , beheaded for extortion , and Marie de Medici , who retired into exile at Brussels ( 1631 ) .

The final conspiracy , that of Cinq Mars , might have succeeded , had not that favorite of Louis XIII ruined himself by signing a treaty with Spain . Cinq Mars was executed , together with De Thou , his too faithful friend ( 1642 ) . The great minister died during the following year . At home he had overcome every obstacle to the royal authority . Without equaling Sully , he had introduced some order into the finances . He had destroyed many feudal fortresses , and by the creation of intendants ( 1635 ) had diminished the hitherto excessive authority of the provincial governors . Abroad his services had been still more illustrious , as we have seen in the history of the Thirty Years ' War . Mazarin and the Fronde. ?

The regent confided the authority to Mazarin , a shrewd and supple minded Italian , obstinate rather than great . Sent as papal nuncio to France , he had been distinguished by Richelieu , who caused his nomination as a cardinal . A reaction against the severe government of Richelieu immediately set in . Pensions , honors , and privileges were lavished by the " Good Queen , " but they did not restrain the great lords , some of whom formed the cabal of " the Consequential Persons . " The regent , or rather Mazarin , perceived the danger in time . Beaufort was sent to the Bastile , and Vendome , Duchess de Chevreuse , and the rest " to their country houses . " The finances were in extreme disorder . Mazarin had neither financial instinct nor the necessary degree of self-sacrifice . To obtain money two unpopular edicts were issued . Mazarin demanded from the sovereign courts their salaries for four years as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertook to play the part which the English Parliament had just assumed as reformer of the state . It proposed for the royal sanction twenty-seven articles , which forbade the collection of taxes until they had been verified and registered , abolished the office of the intendants , and prohibited any servant of the king being detained in durance for more than twenty-four hours without examination . Just then Conde won the victory of Lens . Mazarin , emboldened by this great success , had three councilors , Charton , Blan.emesnil , and Broussel , arrested during the Te Deum ( 1648 ) . Immediately the people rose ; 200 barricades were constructed , and the court in order to gain time sanctioned the demands of Parliament . At that moment the treaty of Westphalia was being signed . When peace was concluded with Austria , the regent summoned Conde to her presence . Immediately the Parliament party began raising troops . They were joined by many of the intriguing and covetous nobles . After a short war in which the insurgents were constantly beaten , peace was signed at Ruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fronde , so called from a child 's game . The haughty Conde , who had won the victory for the court , rendered himself unendurable to the queen and to Mazarin , who had him arrested . The provincial nobility took up arms in favor of the rebellious prince , and Turenne , drawn into : rebellion by . his passion for the Duchess de Longueville , was vanquished at Rethel by the royal troops . Thus Mazarin was triumphant , when Paul de Gondi , incensed at failing to obtain the cardinal 's hat which had been promised him , rekindled the war of the Fronde . Mazarin was obliged to flee to Liege ( 1651 ) . Fortunately Turenne returned to his allegiance and saved the king by his skill at Bleneau and at the battle of the Faubourg Saint Antoine ( 1652 ) . Conde was compelled to flee to Flanders and entered the Spanish service . The Fronde was ended ( 1653 ) .

Treaty of the Pyrenees ( 1659 ) . ? Peace being established at home , war abroad was prosecuted with energy . Turenne forced the Spanish lines before Arras ( 1654 ) and then won the battle of the Downs , which opened to him the Netherlands ( 1658 ) . Several months later Mazarin signed the treaty of the Pyrenees ( 1659 ) . Spain renounced Roussillon , Cerdagne , and Artois . The . Infanta Maria Theresa married Louis NIV , renouncing all claims on the crown of Spain , but Mazarin so managed matters that the renunciation should be void . In the preceding year he had concluded with many German princes the league of the Rhine , which Napoleon renewed a century and a half afterwards , though without greater profit to France . Mazarin died in 1661 . His administration without being grand had been clever . I3is financial management , disastrous for the treasury , had been lucrative for him and his friends . Nevertheless he left royalty free from all domestic obstacles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in letters and arts . Cor- nei.11e , Descartes , Pascal , and Poussin had long before begun what is called the century of Louis XIV . // Europe in 166L ? Thus France was entering upon the most brilliant reign of her old monarchy . Meanwhile the two defeated powers of the religious wars , Spain and Austria , were dressing their wounds : the former listlessly , for she remained thirty-five years under a moribund king ; the latter with the energy which Hungarian turbulence and the nearness of the Ottomans imposed , yet without either brilliancy or grandeur because of the insignificance of her princes . In Eastern Europe other ambitions were in motion , the Swedes against the Danes , the Russians against the Poles . The Turks from time to time were making terrible invasions , the last threats of an exhausted and declining power . The attention of mankind was not as yet seriously attracted in that direction , but was already fixed upon Louis XIV . On examining the history of England during the Thirty Years ' War we shall perceive that to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperial branches corresponds the political abasement of Great Britain during the same period , condemned to civil war or impotency by the secret or avowed Catholicism of its kings . Accession of the Stuarts. ? James VI of Scotland , the son of Mary Stuart and great-grandson of Henry VII , succeeded Elizabeth in 1603 . He wore the two crowns without as yet uniting the two states in one . He abandoned the Protestant policy which in the preceding reign had saved England . He refused to cooperate in the projects of Henry IV , sought alliance with Spain , and remained almost indifferent to the ruin of his son-in-law , the elector palatine . Nevertheless he upheld Anglicanism against the Catholics , who formed the Gunpowder Plot ( 1615 ) , and against the Non-Conformists , whom lie persecuted without pity . Elizabeth had bequeathed to him absolute power . But a firm and glorious hand is required to exercise unfettered authority and under a vain and feeble prince Parliament was no longer docile . In vain did James send five deputies to the Tower in 1614 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his extravagance rendered necessary , he had recourse to the most shameful traffic , put the court offices and judicial functions up at auction , created and sold titles , and then wasted the riches shamefully acquired upon greedy favorites , of whom the most notorious was George Villiers , Marquis of Buckingham . When the Thirty Years ' War broke out , James took advantage of the perils which Protestantism in Germany was incurring to summon a new Parliament . But the Commons granted subsidies only on condition that justice should be done to the nation 's grievances . The old spirit of liberty , repressed by the Tudors , was awakening . The king again dissolved the assembly ( 1622 ) . Allured by the bait of a rich dowry , he sought for his son the hand of an infanta of Spain . This was a fresh outrage to the keenest feelings of the English people , but the plan failed , thanks to the folly of Buckingham . The marriage of the Prince of Wales with Henrietta of France , sister of Louis XIII , was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the throne of England . James I died in 1625 . He published the True Law of Free Monarchy wherein he expounded the divine right of kings . The Anglican clergy , in its canons of 1608 erecting this right into a dogma , made absolute obedience to the reigning prince an article of faith . Thus the alliance of the altar and the throne against the public liberties was everywhere ratified , even in the heart of the Reformation . Charles I ( 1625-1649 ) . - Charles T , a prince of sedate and pure character , thus found himself from childhood imbued with the principles of despotism . His wife showed the Catholics a preference which wounded the nation . Buckingham , who had contrived to remain the favorite of the son as he had been the favorite of the father , retained an influence which diminished the respect of the country for the king . The struggle with the Commons immediately began afresh . This assembly was composed of the younger sons of the nobility and of citizens of the middle class , who , having grown rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the practice to vote the customs duties for the whole duration of the reign . The lower Chamber granted them only for one year and Charles in anger dismissed the assembly . The Parliament of 1626 went still farther . It impeached Buckingham and was immediately prorogued . In the hope of acquiring some popularity Buckingham persuaded Charles I to support the Protestants of France and conducted a fleet to the rescue of La Rochelle . The expedition failed through the incapacity of the general ( 1627 ) . This check encouraged the Commons , who forced the king to give his sanction to the Petition of Right and addressed to him two remonstrances , one against the illegal collection of the customs duties , the other against his favorite , who was described as the author of the public wretchedness . The king again prorogued Parliament , and John Felton , a fanatic , assassinated Buckingham ( 1628 ) . Charles then called to the ministry Archbishop Laud and the Earl of Strafford , and decided to govern without a Parliament , that is to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without Parliament there were no subsidies , and consequently no means of taking part in the great events which were agitating Europe . This inaction discredited the English government in the eyes of its own subjects . The enormous fines imposed upon opponents and the cruelty of Laud toward the dissenters , as in torturing Leighton and Prynne , intensified the general discontent . The prevailing sentiment was manifest in the intense sympathy shown John Hampden when he opposed the tax of ship-money by legal resistance ( 1636 ) . Scotland had been attacked in its Presbyterian polity by Laud . It protested by an insurrection at Edinburgh ( 1637 ) , and formed the political and religious league of the Covenant ( 1638 ) , against which the English army led by Strafford refused to fight ( 1640 ) . After eleven years without the Chambers , the king // confessed himself vanquished and convoked a fourth Parliament . It refused the least subsidy until justice should be done to the complaints of the nation , and was speedily prorogued . Compelled by necessity the king assembled a fifth Parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Long Parliament . Exceeding its original purpose , it took charge of the taxes and of the judicial authority , abolished extraordinary tribunals , proclaimed its own periodical character , and impeached of high crimes the Earl of Strafford , whose head fell upon the block ( 16.11 ) . Meanwhile a formidable insurrection broke out among the Irish , who slew 40,000 Protestants . When the king asked for means to reduce the rebels , Parliament , replied by bitter remonstrances , and voted the militia bill , Odell put the army under its own control . Charles endeavored to arrest the leaders of the opposition in the very unidst , of the assembly . Failing in his purpose he quitted London to begin the civil war ( 1642 ) . The Civil War ( 1642-1647 ) . - Parliment held the capital , the great cities , the seaports , and the fleet . The king was followed by most of the nobility , who were better trained to areas than the burgher militia . In the northern and western counties the Royalists or Cavaliers were in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; IIi center and the southeast , which were the richest sections , were close together , and formed a sort of belt rotund London . At first the king had the advantage . From Nottingham , where he had raised his standard , he marched upon London . The Parliamentarians , defeated at Edge 1 1 1 1 1 and Worcester ( 1642 ) , redoubled their energy . Hampden raised a regiment of infantry among his tenants , friends , and neighbors . Oliver Cromwell , then beginning to emerge from obscurity , formed in the eastern counties from the sons of farmers and small landed proprietors select squadrons , who opposed religious enthusiasm to the sentiments of honor which animated the Cavaliers . The Parliamentarians , victorious at Newbury , allied themselves with the Scotch by a solemn covenant . Parliament was composed of various parties . The elder were Presbyterians , who though abolishing grades in the Church wished to preserve them in the state , and the Independents , who rejected both the peerage and the episcopacy , both the temporal and religious sovereignty of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Puritanism , such as Levelers , Anabaptists , and Millenarians . Their leaders were clever men . Ablest of all was Oliver Cromwell , an ambitious and sphinx-like genius , a politician , and an enthusiast . With his squadrons surnamed Ironsides , he won the battle of Marston Moor in 1644 and then that of Newbury , which saved the revolution . These successes helped the Independents , although a minority in Parliament , to pass the self-denying ordinance which excluded the deputies from public affairs . This was equivalent to handing over the army to the Independents . Cromwell then prosecuted the war with vigor . The king 's last army was crushed at Naseby ( 1645 ) . while his lieutenant Montrose was beaten by the Scotch Covenanters . The disheartened king withdrew through weariness to the camp of the Scotch , who sold him to Parliament for 400,000 pounds sterling ( 1647 ) . Execution of Charles I ( 1649 ) . ? The Presbyterians would gladly have treated with their captive . Supported by the army , Cromwell " purged " Parliament of the Presbyterian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court of justice , which sent him to the scaffold ( January 30 , 1649 ) . His bloody death caused his acts of violence and perfidy to be forgotten . It revived the monarchical creed of England and royalty again became popular on the day when the head of the king rolled from under the axe of the executioner . The Commonwealth of England ( 1649-1660 ) . Cromwell. ? The Republic was proclaimed . Catholic Ireland and Scotland , who remembered that the Stuarts were of Scottish race , protested against the revolution which had been accomplished . Cromwell subdued the former by an atrocious war . By the victories of Dunbar and Worcester , he forced the latter to recognize the authority of the Parliament of London ( 1651 ) . The new government announced its foreign policy by the daring but sagacious // Navigation Act . Thereby it prohibited the entrance into English ports of all vessels laden with merchandise , not produced on the soil or by the people whose flag the vessel bore . This act remained in force until January 1 , 1850 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her marine .

The Barbary States were chastised ; the Pope was threatened with hearing " the English cannon thunder at the Castle of San Angelo " if his persecution of the Reformed Party did not cease . Thus Cromwell resumed the role which the Stuarts had abandoned , and which Louis NIV was about to abandon , of defender of Protestant interests . Unfortunately for England he retained power only five years ( 1658 ) . His son Richard succeeded , but could not replace him and abdicated after a few months . England relapsed into anarchy . The clever General Monk paved the way for the return of monarchy . He dissolved the Rump Parliament , which had again assembled , formed a Parliament devoted to himself , and the combined Tories and Whigs recalled the Stuarts without conditions ( 1660 ) .

Confronted by such perils , the country had allowed the authority of its kings to increase . But now that Spain was dying and France no longer threatening and the religious questions definitely settled , England wished to reenter her ancient path . Charles II ( 1660-1685 ) . ? Charles II seemed at first to understand the state of the popular mind . He remained faithful to Anglican Protestantism and permitted the Parliament to enjoy its ancient prerogatives .

After the triple alliance of The Hague ( 1666 ) , which his people imposed upon him that they might arrest France in the Netherlands , he sold himself . Louis paid him a pension of 2,000,000 francs until his death . But the fear of anarchy , which in 1660 had prostrated England at the feet of Charles II , had vanished . Little by little , there had been formed in the heart of the nation and in Parliament an opposition , which in 1674 was strong enough to extort the Test Bill . This bill was the prelude to the second and imminent revolution . Let us pause for a time at this point in the history of // Charles II .

Later on we shall trace the events which will hurl the Stuarts from the throne and give to Great Britain the leadership in the opposition to France . // Colbert. ? After the death of Mazarin Louis 11 V announced his intention of governing without any primp minister . This sovereign , then aged twenty-four , throughout his after life kept the pledge which he Lad taken to exercise manfully his royal trade . His was not a great intellect , and yet despite his faults he was a great king . At least during the first half of his reign , he practiced the chief art of sovereigns , which is to understand how to choose good depositaries of their power , Colbert , intrusted from 1661 to 1683 with the finances , agriculture , commerce , manufactures , and the navy , caused all these branches of the national activity to prosper . The period of his ministry is the most glorious in the reign of Louis XIV , for he moderated the king 's ambition and developed the national forces .

Every year he drew up a sort of national budget , and raised the net revenue of the treasury to 89,000,000 . Ile encouraged industry by subsidies , and protected it by tariffs which imposed heavy duties upon similar products from abroad . In order to facilitate business and transportation , internal customs-duties were abolished in many provinces , highways were repaired or created , and the canal of Languedoc was constructed between the ocean and the Mediterranean . He organized the five great commercial companies of the East Indies , the West Indies , the Levant , Senegal , and the North , which competed with the merchants of London and Amsterdam ; and he encouraged the merchant marine by bounties . The military marine developed such vigorous life that in 1692 it became possible to equip more than 300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which furnished 70,000 mariners , the recruiting of the crews was insured . The port of Rochefort was created , that of Dunkirk was bought back from the English , Brest and Toulon were enlarged , and a magnificent colonial empire , founded in the Antilles and in North America , would have delivered that continent to French influence had men understood how to carry out the plans of the great minister . Louvois. ? At the same time Louvois was organizing the army , which he compelled to wear a uniform . He created the companies of grenadiers and hussar corps , and introduced the bayonet . He founded the artillery schools of Douai , Metz , and Strasburg , organized thirty regiments of militia which the communes equipped , and companies of cadets , in which originated the school of Saint Cyr and the Polytechnique . Furthermore he subjected even officers of noble birth to strict discipline . A great engineer and patriotic citizen , Vauban , fortified the frontiers . War with Flanders ( 1667 ) . ?

At the death of Philip IV , availing himself of 4 the right of devolution in force in Brabant , he claimed to inherit the Spanish Netherlands through his wife , Maria Theresa , the eldest sister of the new king of Spain , // Charles H. Holland and England were at first neutral . Spain thus left alone could not defend herself . The French armies in three months ' time captured the strongholds of western Flanders , and in seventeen days in the depth of winter overran all Franche-Comte ( 1668 ) .

The War with Holland ( 1672 ) . - Four years of peace were employed in preparing a terrible storm against a little country , Holland . Colbert , who wished to develop the maritime commerce of France , grew anxious at the 15,000 merchant vessels of the Dutch . Moreover , when he imposed exorbitant duties on their cloths , they retaliated by onerous duties on French wines and brandies . Therefore Colbert did not oppose a war which seemed likely to rid French commerce of a formidable rival . Louvois desired war to render himself necessary . Louis XIV declared it that he might humble those republicans who had just placed a check on his good fortune . Thereby he abandoned the policy of Henry IV and of Richelieu , which was the protection of small states and of Protestantism and opposition to useless conquests .

They deposed and murdered their Grand Pensioner , Jan de Witt , put in his place as stadtholder William of Orange , who opened the locks , flooded the country , and forced the invaders to retreat before the inundation . At the same time he formed a formidable coalition against Louis . Spain , the emperor , many German princes , and even England , though her king was pensioned by Louis , joined Holland . France made headway everywhere . The king in person subjugated Franche-Comte ( 1674 ) .

His abandonment by England decided Louis to accept the treaty of Nimeguen , which awarded him Franche-Comte with fourteen Flemish strongholds , and forced Denmark and Brandenburg to restore all the conquests which they had made from Sweden . Thus France emerged greater than before from a struggle with all Europe . The French northern and eastern frontiers became farther from Paris . But this proudest period of the reign was also the point of departure for the calamities which were soon to follow . The war with Holland had directed against France the coalitions which France had formerly organized against Austria , and had founded the good fortune of William of Orange , who a few years afterwards became king of England .

Other similar mistakes were sure to follow , for after the death of Colbert in 1683 the hard and narrow influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counteracted . " If it hath not pleased God , " said Henry IV , in the preamble to the edict of Nantes , " to permit His Holy Name to be adored by all our subjects in one and the same form of religion , let it at least be adored with the same intent . . . ; and pray ye unto the Divine Goodness that He may make men understand that in the observance of this ordinance exists the principal foundation of their union , tranquillity , and repose , and of the reestablishTHE // ment of this State in its pristine splendor . " These glowing words had worthily inaugurated the new era which Richelieu and Mazarin continued abroad by their Protestant alliances , and at home by their respect for religious liberty . But Louis XIV , intoxicated with his omnipotence and led astray by the fatal counsels of a party , which ( luring three centuries had ruined every cause which it defended , undertook to repudiate the toleration of Henry IV as he had repudiated his diplomacy . As he allowed in his kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , that of the absolute prince , so he wished that there should be but one religion , Catholicism . To convert the Protestants he first sent into the cantons where they were numerous booted missionaries or the dragonades . In 1685 he officially revoked the edict of Nantes . The Reformers were bound to undergo conversion or to leave the kingdom . Their children were taken from them by force to be reared in the Catholic Church . They had furnished to French industries its most skillful workmen . Two or three hundred thousand quitted the kingdom , among whom were 9000 sailors , 12,000 soldiers , and 600 officers . One suburb of London was peopled by these refugees . Berlin and Brandenburg welcomed great numbers . Foreigners became possessed of the secrets of the French manufactures . Among the learned men who during the last century and a half have been the honor of Holland , Germany , England , and even of 1 taly , there are many descendants of the exiles of Louis XIV . THE ENGLISH REVOLUTION ( 1688 ) Awakening of Liberal Ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Protestant powers to the revocation of the edict of Nantes was the English revolution , which hurled from the throne the Catholic James II and placed thereon the Calvinist William III . Charles II had hired himself out to Louis XIV , but England had not ratified the bargain . In 1668 she forced her king to join the Swedes and Dutch in rescuing the Spanish Netherlands . Again in 1674 she compelled him to renounce the French alliance , and then by opposing France to bring about the peace of Nimeguen . The king , defeated on a political question , was defeated again on a question of religion . He was suspected of favoring Catholicism . Therefore Parliament voted the Test Bill , which obliged officials to declare under oath that they did not believe in transubstantiation . Thus public employment was closed to Catholics and their exclusion lasted until 1829 . The Popish plot , imagined by the wretched Titus Oates , and the memory of the fire of London in 1666 which had been attributed to the Catholics , provoked extremely rigorous measures . Eight Jeusits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his seventy years , and the Duke of York , the king 's brother , who had abjured Protestantism , was threatened with deprivation of his rights to the crown . In order to restrain the royal despotism the Whigs or liberals who controlled Parliament passed the famous bill of habeas corpus in 1679 , which confirmed the law of personal security written in Magna Charta , and so often violated . Every prisoner must be examined by the judge within twenty-four hours after his arrest , and released or set at liberty under bail if the proofs were insufficient . Catholic and Absolutist Reaction . James II ( 1685 ) . - Thus Parliament at the same time repressed the dissenters and the court . The English were peacefully effecting their internal revolution when the violent put everything in peril . The Puritans rose in Scotland .

So James II quietly took possession of the throne in 1685 , the year when the edict of Nantes was revoked . His nephew Monmouth and the Duke of Argyle tried hard to overthrow him , but both perished // after the defeat of Sedgemoor , and the odious Jeffries sent many of their partisans to the block . If the Anglican clergy and those among the aristocracy who were called Tories or conservatives were disposed to pardon the Stuarts for their despotism , they had no intention of allowing royalty by right divine , a ( lc() rcx , a rege lex , to bring back Catholicism , which surely would demand restitution of the immense church property which they had seized . When James sent to the Vatican a solemn embassy to reconcile England with the Roman Church , the archbishop of Canterbury protested . He was thrown into the tower with six of his suffragans .

James deserted by all fled to France , and Parliament proclaimed William III king . It first made him sign the Declaration of Rights , which substituted royalty by consent for royalty by divine right , and which contained nearly all the guarantees of a free government : the periodical convocation of Parliament , the voting of taxes , laws made by the joint consent of the Chambers and the king , and the right of petition . A few months later Locke , one of those whom James II had persecuted , set forth the theory of the revolution of 1688 , by recognizing national sovereignty and liberty as the sole legitimate and durable principles of a government .

England had the good fortune , thanks to her insular position and to her traditions , to grasp the principle which was destined to be that of the future . To her wisdom she already owes two centuries of tranquillity amid the ruins which have been crumbling around her . COALITIONS AGAINST FRANCE ( 1688-1714 ) Formation of the League of Augsburg ( 1686 ) . - In the sixteenth century and in the first half of the seventeenth , France took in hand the defense of Protestantism and of the general liberties of Europe against the Hapsburgs of Madrid and of Vienna and against the ultramontanism of the Vatican . But with Louis XIV she threatened the conscience of the adherents of the Reformation and the independence of states . England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty in it , as had done Henry IV and Richelieu . While the Protestants who had been expelled from France carried in all directions their resentment against Louis , he wantonly braved Europe by aggressions made in time of peace . By duplicity he gained possession of twenty cities , among which was Strasburg ( 1681 ) . He treated the Pope with arrogance and compelled the Doge of Genoa to come and humble himself at Versailles . He bought Casal in Italy so as to dominate the valley of the Po , claimed a part of the Palatinate as the dowry of his sister-in-law , opposed the installation of the archbishop of Cologne , and occupied Bonn , Neuss , and Kaiserwerth . The Powers , rendered uneasy by such ambition , formed as early as 1686 the League of Augsburg. which England joined in 1689 . War of the League of Augsburg ( 1689-1697 ) . - Louis directed his first blows against William .

Thenceforth the sea belonged to the English and French commerce was at their mercy despite the exploits of bold captains like Jean Bart . On land the French maintained the advantage . Luxembourg beat the allies at Fleurus , and Neerwinden . Catinat occupied Piedmont and assured its possession by the victories of Staffarde and La Marsa.ille . But France was exhausting herself in an unequal struggle . " Half of the kingdom , " wrote Vauban , " lives on the alms of the other half . " Moreover Charles II of Spain was dying . The Spanish succession was at last about to be thrown open , and Europe needed repose in order to prepare herself for this event . Hoping to obtain peace , Louis instigated dissensions among his enemies . The desertion of the Duke of Savoy , to whom his states and even Pignerol were restored , induced the allies to sign the treaty of Ryswick ( 1697 ) . Louis XIV recognized William III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exception of Alsace whatever had been awarded him , put the Duke of Lorraine again in possession of his duchy , but kept the west of San Domingo , Landau , and Sarrelouis . War of the Spanish Succession ( 1701-1714 ) . - At Madrid the elder branch of the house of Austria was about to become extinct . France , Austria , and Bavaria each disputed the inheritance of Charles IT . Louis XIV asserted the rights of his wife , Maria Theresa , the eldest child of Philip IV . Leopold I had married her younger sister , Margarita . The Elector of Bavaria laid claim in the name of his minor son , the grandson of this same Margarita . The first plan for the partition of the Spanish monarchy , favorably entertained by William , was rejected by Charles TI , who preferred the boy duke of Bavaria . That youth died . France and Austria being thus left as the only claimants , Charles by a will bequeathed his estates to the Duke of Anjou , grandson of Louis XIV , in the hope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this increasing greatness of the French Bourbons . Louis XIV alarmed it still more by preserving for the new king , Philip V , his rights of eventual succession to the crown of Saint Louis . Such succession would have reestablished to the advantage of France the enormous power of Charles V. Louis posted French garrisons in the Spanish Netherlands to the great consternation of Holland . Then on the death of James II he recognized his son as king of England , thereby openly violating the treaty of Ryswick ( 1701 ) . A new league was soon concluded at The Hague between England and the United Provinces . Prussia , the empire , Portugal , and even the Duke of Savoy , the fatherin-law of Philip V , successively joined it ( 1701-1703 ) . Three superior men , Heinsius , Grand Pensioner of Holland , Marlborough , leader of the Whig party in England , a clever diplomat and great general , and Prince Eugene , a Frenchman who had emigrated to Austria , guided the coalition . France had Chamillart to replace Colbert and Louvois . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than her ministers . Austria began hostilities by reverses . Eugene was defeated at Luzzara by the Duke of Vendome ( 1702 ) , as was another imperial army at Friedlingen and at Hochstedt by Villars . But Marlborough landed in the Netherlands , and the Archduke Charles in Portugal . The Duke of Savoy deserted France and the Camisards rose in the Cevennes . The loss of the second terrible battle of Hochstedt or Blenheim drove the French out of Germany ( 1704 ) . The battle of Ramillies gave the Netherlands to the allies ; that of Turin gave them Milan and the kingdom of Naples ( 1706 ) . Toulon was menaced ( 1707 ) . To arrest the enemy in the Netherlands Louis XIV collected another magnificent army . It was put to rout at Oudenarde . Lille surrendered after two months of siege ( 1708 ) . The winter of 1709 added its rigors to the French disasters and Louis sued for peace . The allies required that he should himself expel his grandson from Spain . He preferred to continue the fight . Villars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the meantime Vendome secured the throne of Spain to Philip V by the victory of Villaviciosa ( 1710 ) , and the Archduke Charles , the candidate of the allies , be- // came emperor of Germany by the death of his brother ( 1711 ) . The European balance of power would have been disturbed in a much more threatening manner by his uniting to the imperial crown the crowns of Naples and Spain , than by Philip V at Madrid . Thus England had no more interest in this war . The Whigs who wished to continue it fell from power , and the Tory ministry that replaced them entered upon negotiations with France . Several months later the imperial army was beaten at Denain by Villars . This glorious victory hastened the conclusion of peace , which was signed at Utrecht , by England , Portugal , Savoy , Prussia , and Holland ( 1713 ) . Treaties of Utrecht and Rastadt ( 1713-1714 ) . - Louis accepted the succession as established in England by the revolution of 1688 , ceded to the English the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dunkirk , and agreed that the crowns of France and Spain should never be united on one and the same head . Holland obtained the right of placing garrisons in most of the strongholds of the Spanish Netherlands so as to prevent their falling into the hands of France . The Duke of Savoy received Sicily with the title of king . The Elector of Brandenburg was recognized as king of Prussia , having just purchased that title from the emperor . The latter , left alone , continued the war , but the capture of Landau and Freiburg induced him to sign the treaty of Rastadt ( 1714 ) by which he acquired some of the foreign possessions of Spain , the Spanish Netherlands , Naples , Sardinia , Milan , and the fortresses of Tuscany . France made many sacrifices , but Spain , no longer distracted by her Netherlands , became her natural ally instead of being as for two centuries her constant enemy . This change meant security on the southern French frontier and hence greater strength in the northeast . Louis XIV died shortly afterwards ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XIV the Personification of Monarchy by Divine Right. ? He left the kingdom without commerce , without manufactures , drained of men and money , with a public // debt which would amount at the present day to $1,600 , - 000,000 . Thus the setting of that long reign did not fulfill the promise of its dawn . The acquisition of two provinces , Flanders and Franche-Comte , and of several cities , Strasburg , Landau , and Dunkirk , was a small compensation for the frightful misery which France endured and which she might have been spared , had Louis remained faithful to the policy of Henry IV and of Richelieu . Moreover she had declined in just the same degree as others had risen . Spain had not recovered her strength . Austria still remained feeble .

By the matchless brilliancy of his court , his magnificent festivals , his sumptuous buildings , his taste for arts and letters ; by his lofty bearing , the dignity which he showed in everything , the serene confidence which he cherished in his rights and his superior intelligence , Louis was the most majestic incarnation of royalty . To him is attributed the saying : " I am the state . " In consequence of the energetic centralization which placed all France at Versailles , and Versailles in the study of the prince , the saying was true . IIe firmly believed , and others believed with him , that the property as well as the lives of his subjects belonged to him ; that he was their intelligence , their will , their spring of action ; that is to say , that 20,000,000 of men lived in him and for him . But his errors , his vices , were sacred also , like those of the gods of Olympus whose images filled his palaces . At need the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public treasury his pleasures , and debauchery became a royal institution which conferred on the mistresses of the king rank at court . Such a government might suit the Orient , which knows only force and submits to it with resignation . It could // not last in our Western world , where humanity has come to consciousness of itself and of its lofty rights . By developing manufactures and commerce and consequently the fortunes of his people , and by favoring arts and letters , or in other words the development of the mind , Louis himself paved the way for the formation of two new powers which were destined , first to undermine , then to overthrow his system . ARTS , LETTERS , AND SCIENCES IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY Letters and Arts in France. ? The sixteenth century effected religious reform . The eighteenth was to effect political reform . Placed between these two revolutionary ages , the seventeenth was and has stood forth , especially in France , as the great literary epoch . The generations which live in stormy times rise higher and descend lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflection of a peaceful yet fertile age , where art is its own end and its own recompense . Long before Louis XIV took the government in hand and reigned by himself ( 1661 ) , France had already reaped half of the literary glory which the seventeenth century had in store . Many of her great writers had produced their masterpieces and nearly all were in full possession of their talent . The Cid was acted in 1636 , and the Discourse on Method appeared in 1637 . Thus the magnificent harvest , then garnered by French intellect , germinated and fructified of itself . When under Henry IV and Richelieu , calm succeeded to the sterile agitation of religions struggles , intellectual questions took the precedence over those of war ; and when several great men appeared , all the higher society followed them . People discussed a beautiful verse as formerly they had discussed a handsome gun . They would even have lost themselves in the mental refinements and elaborate subtleties of the Hotel de Rambouillet , had it not been for the manly accents of Cor- neille @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moliere , Boileau , and La Fontaine , the biblical eloquence of Bossuet , the energy of Pascal , and the penetrating grace of Racine . On that roll of honor let us also place the names of Madame de Sevigne for her Letters , of La Rochefoueauld for his Maxims , of La Bruyere for his Characters , of Fenelon for his Telemaque , of Saint Simon for his formidable Memoirs , and of Bourdaloue for his Sermons . Such learned men as Casaubon , Scaliger , Saumaise , du Cange , Baluze , and the Benedictines illumined the confusion of our origin and gave us a better acquaintance with antiquity . Bayle continued the traditions of Rabelais and of Montaigne . Descartes was the great revolutionist of the time , demanding that the mind should banish all preexisting ideas , so as to be free from all prejudice and all error and thus admit only such truths as evidence should invincibly force upon the reason . Through prudence Descartes veiled the eyes of his contemporaries to the consequences of his Method , yet that method became the essential condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it will become the law of the world . At that time France possessed four painters of high rank ; Poussin , Lesueur , Claude Lorraine , and at some distance from them Lebrun ; one admirable sculptor , Puget ; the talented architects , Mansart and Perrault ; and a clever musician , Lulli . Letters and Arts in Other Countries. ? In Italy there was literary as well as political decline . In Spain appeared Lope de Vega and Calderon . The Don Quixote of Cervantes belongs in date and subject to another century when men still thought of the Middle Ages , even though only with ridicule . Then England boasted her glorious literary age with Shakespeare , Milton , Dryden , and Addison . Germany was passing through her age of iron . The Reformation , which had fallen into the hands of princes as Italian Catholicism had into the hands of the Jesuits , seems to have arrested thought . The Dutch Grotius and the Swede Puffendorf settled the rights of peace and war according to the principles // of humanity and justice . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his Leviathan that war was the natural state of humanity and that men needed a good despot to keep them from cutting each other 's throats . This was the theory of absolute power according to philosophy , as I3ossuet had expounded it according to religion . This doctrine was happily refuted by another philosopher , Locke , in his essay on Civil Government . Therein the councilor of William III demonstrated that civil society is subjected to the established power not otherwise than by the consent of the community . " The community , " said he , " can set up whatever government it sees fit . That government in order to conform to reason must fulfill two conditions : the first is , that the power of making the laws , binding upon the subjects as well as upon the monarch , ought to be separated from the power which executes them ; the second is that no one shall be required to pay taxes without his consent , given personally or by his representatives . " " Equality , " he said , in another place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to liberty , so that no one is subjected to the will or authority of another . " This treatise appeared in 1690 , just a century before the French Revolution , of which Locke is one of the precursors . What is the necessity of common consent , established as a principle of all political society , but the recognition of the sovereignty of the nation ! The ideas of the English philosopher , like those of Descartes , were destined to make progress slowly throughout the eighteenth century . Two other philosophers deserve mention for their influence in the realm of metaphysics . They are the pantheist Spinoza , a Jew of Amsterdam , and Leibnitz , the universal genius . In the arts the first rank then belonged to the Dutch and Flemish schools , represented by Rubens , Van Dyck , Rembrandt , and the two Teniers . Spain possessed Velasquez , Murillo , and Ribera , who left no heirs . Italy brought forth Guido and Bernini , who mark the decline against which nevertheless Salvator Rosa was a protest . England and Germany had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The universe is twofold . There is a moral and a physical world . Antiquity traversed the one in every direction . It extended and developed the faculties of which God has deposited the germs in our mortal clay . But of the physical world it knew almost nothing . This ignorance was destined to last so long as the true methods of investigation were unknown . They could be found only after men had become convinced that the universe is governed by the immutable laws of eternal wisdom and not by the arbitrary volitions of capricious powers . Alchemy , magic , astrology , all those follies of the Middle Ages , became sciences on the day when man , no longer halting at isolated phenomena , strove to grasp the laws themselves which produced them . That day began in the sixteenth century with Copernicus , but it is only in the seventeenth that the revolution was accomplished and triumphant with Bacon and Galileo . The former proclaimed its necessity ; the latter by his discoveries demonstrated its benefits . At the head of the scientific movement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth of Copernicus ' system ; Galileo of Pisa , who expiated in the cells of the Inquisition his demonstration of the motion of the earth ; the Englishman Newton , who discovered the principal laws of optics and universal gravitation ; Leibnitz , who disputes with him the honor of having created the differential calculus ; Pascal , the inventor of the calculus of probabilities ; Descartes , equally celebrated as a man of learning and a philosopher , for these mighty minds did not confine themselves to a single study . In their train a throng of men entered eagerly upon the paths thus thrown open . Papin ascertains the power of steam as a motive force ; Weiner , the velocity of light ; Harvey , the circulation of the blood ; and Cassini and Picard fix the meridian of Paris . To the thermometer constructed by Galileo , Toricelli adds the barometer , Huygens the pendulum clock , and science finds itself armed with precious instruments for investigation . Thus in this century three countries were in full deCREATION // cline . They are Germany , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I taly , which persecuted Galileo , and Spain , where we find only painters and playwrights . The two nations , France and England , to whom strength and preponderance had passed , were on the contrary in the full tide of their literary age . CREATION OF RUSSIA . DOWNFALL OF SWEDEN The Northern States at the Beginning of the Eighteenth Century. ? The East and Northern Europe were an unknown region to the Romans and Greeks . In the Middle Ages , the activity of the nations was displayed in countries of the center and west . The Slays and Scandinavians remained generally apart , uninfluential and obscure . The Russians had been subjugated by the Mongols . After long silence the Swedes had burst upon the empire under Gustavus Adolphus like a thunderbolt . Thanks to their victories over the Hernnnns , Poles , and Russians , the Baltic at the middle of the eighteenth century was a Swedish lake surrounded by an extended line of fortified posts . But their domination was fragile . It was constructed in defiance of geography and was surrounded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still stretched from the Carpathians to the Baltic and from the Oder to the sources of the Dnieper and Volga , but its anarchical constitution and its elective royalty rendered it defenseless to the attacks of foreigners . An elector of Saxony was then king of Poland . The Russians were cut off by the Swedes , the Poles , and the duchy of Courland from access to the southern Baltic . Likewise they were separated on the south from the Black Sea by Tartar hordes and by the warrior republic of the Cossacks , unruly subjects of Poland . They were shut in from every direction except toward the desert regions of Siberia . When the powerful republic of Novgorod fell in 1476 , their road was open to the Arctic Ocean and the eastern Baltic . By the destruc388 HISTORY OF MODERN TIMES tion of the Tartars of Astrakan , they had reached the Caspian Sea . At the treaty of Vilna ( 1656 ) they forced from the Poles the cession of Smolensk , Tehernigoff , and the Ukraine . This was their first step toward the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III had abolished in his family the law of appanage , thereby establishing the unity of authority and of the state . On the other hand he had retained it among the nobility , which in consequence became divided and enfeebled . In the sixteenth century Ivan IV spent fifteen years in breaking the boyars to the yoke with that implacable cruelty which won for him the surname of the Terrible , and a ukase in 1593 reduced all peasants to the servitude of the soil by forbidding them to change master and land . Peter the Great ( 1682 ) . ? He , who was destined to be the creator of Russia , in 1682 , when ten years old , received the title of Tsar . Guided by the Genevese Lefort , who extolled to him the arts of the West , in 1697 he went to Saardam in Holland to there learn the art of building vessels . Afterwards he studied England and her manufactures , and Germany and her military organization . At Vienna the news reached him that the Strelitzi had revolted . He hurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel and 5000 beheaded . Then he began his reforms . He organized regiments , in which he compelled the sons of the boyars to serve as soldiers before becoming officers . He founded schools in mathematics and astronomy , and a naval academy , and undertook to unite the Don and the Volga by a canal . A great war interrupted these achievements . The preponderance of Sweden weighed upon her neighbors . At the death of the Swedish king , Charles XI , Russia , Denmark , and Poland thought the time had come for despoiling his successor , Charles NII , a youth of eighteen , and for wresting from the Swedes their provinces on the Baltic ( 1700 ) . Charles forestalled the attack by an impetuous invasion of Denmark . Then he marched rapidly against 80,000 Russians , whom he defeated with 8000 Swedes at the battle of Narva , expelled the Saxons from Livonia , pursued them into Saxony , dethroned Augustus II and forced him by the treaty of Altranstadt to abdicate his Polish crown in favor of Stanislaus Lechzinski . But while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1701-1706 ) , in his rear Peter the Great was creating an empire and forming an army modeled upon what he had seen in the kingdoms of the West . Peter conquered Ingria and Carelia and founded Saint Petersburg ( 1703 ) , so as to take possession of the Gulf of Finland . Charles XII then returned against him . While trying to effect a junction with Mazeppa , the Hetman of the Cossacks , who had promised biro 100,000 men , he lost his way in the marshes of Pinsk and afforded the Tsar time to crush a Swedish relief force . The cruel winter of 1709 increased his distress . His defeat at Poltava ( 1709 ) forced him to flee with 500 horse to the Ottomans . From Bender , his place of refuge , he roused them against the Russians . One hundred and fifty thousand Ottomans crossed the Danube , and Peter , surrounded in his camp on the banks of the Pruth , would have been crushed had not the grand vizier been bribed by Catherine the Tsaritsa ( 1711 ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poland . By this treaty Charles XII was vanquished a second time . He persisted in remaining three years longer in Turkey and then set out again for Sweden , which the northern powers were despoiling . George I of England , Elector of Hanover , was buying Bremen and Verden . The king of Prussia was seizing Stettin and Pomerania . Stralsund still held out . Charles XII threw himself into it , defended it for a month , then returned to Sweden and met his death at the siege of Frederickshall , perhaps by treason ( 1718 ) . He left Sweden exhausted by this war of fifteen years ' duration . She was deprived of her foreign possessions , without agriculture , without manufactures , without commerce , and had lost 250,000 men , the flower of her people , and her ascendency in Northern Europe . This heroic adventurer had annihilated the fortune of his people and ruined his country for a century . // Peter on the contrary was creating the fortune of his empire . By the treaty of Nystadt he granted peace to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their renouncing all claim to Livonia , Esthonia , Ingria , a part of Carelia , and the country of Viborg and Finland . When the ambassador of France implored less onerous terms , Peter replied , " I do not wish to see my neighbor 's grounds from my windows . " Thus Sweden declined and Russia ascended . Thus a twofold example was furnished to the world of what one man can do for the ruin or the advancement of nations not yet capable of controlling their destiny themselves . In 1716 the Tsar undertook another journey throughout Europe . This time he came to France , where he offered to replace Sweden as the ally of France against Austria . Cardinal Dubois , who was the hireling of England , caused the rejection of his proposals . This journey was as fruitful as the first one in developing the resources of Russia . From it she gained engineers and workmen of all sorts , with manufactories and foundries . The Tsar established uniformity in weights and measures , a commercial tribunal , canals , and shipyards . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China , Persia , and India . He foresaw the future of the Amur River , which empties into the Eastern Sea . In order to make the clergy entirely dependent upon him , he replaced the Patriarch by a synod , which he recognized as the supreme head of the Church , and he made of the Russian nation a regiment , by applying the military hierarchy to the whole administration of his empire . His son Alexis was active against these reforms . The prince was tried , condemned to death , and probably executed . At all events Alexis died on the day after his sentence and many of his accomplices perished . " The Tsar Peter , " said Frederick II , " was the nitric acid which eats into iron . " He died in 1725 . Regency of Orleans ; Ministries of Dubois , Bourbon , and Fleury ( 1715-1743 ) . ? The successor of Louis XIV was only five years old .

Through fear of Philip V of Spain , who by birth was nearer to the throne of France than was the regent , Dubois made a close alliance with England , which paid him a pension ; and the spectacle was presented of the French being on their guard against the Spaniards , their friends of yesterday . Suddenly Cardinal Alberoni , the minister of Philip V , revealed his plan of restoring to Spain what the treaty of Utrecht had taken from her . Ile endeavored , by the help of the Ottomans , to keep Austria busy , to overthrow the regent by a conspiracy , and reestablish the Stuarts through the sword of Charles XII . But Prince Eugene defeated the Ottomans at Belgrade ( 1717 ) . The conspiracy against the regent failed . Charles XII perished in Norway . The English destroyed the Spanish fleet near Messina . The French entered Navarre . So Spain found herself crippled by the struggle and France was still under the regent and Dubois . Louis XIV had left behind him financial ruin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onethird was already due . Two years ' revenues had been spent in advance . Though the budget was 165,000,000 francs , the deficit was 78,000,000 . The regent , after having exhausted every other means to no purpose , decided to have recourse to the expedients of Law . That bold Scotch financier had founded a wonderfully successful bank and also the India Company , which , successful at first , ended in a complete failure . By clever maneuvers , the bonds of the company were raised to the fictitious value of 2,000,000,000 francs . The mirage could not
