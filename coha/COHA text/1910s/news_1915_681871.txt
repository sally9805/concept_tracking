txt What of Unmarried Women ? In Cardinal Gibbons 's letter to Mr. Nugent there is only one class of women dealt with ? the married or to-be-married woman . For her there is , indeed ; " glory enough " to be found in the opportunity to make a home , raise a family , and use to the full that " influence which a sensible matron exerts over her husband and sons . " But Cardinal Gibbons takes no account of the woman who has had no chance to marry , whose responsibilities in the parental home hilVO debarred her from seeking the cloister , and who has had , therefore , to work for a living , yet who would like to feel , if only to the extent of one vote , she has the privilege of using her " inspired instinct " on the Side of justice and truth , I am not an advocate of woman suffrage , but this side of the question keeps me from opposing it .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
