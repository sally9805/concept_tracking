The testimony of State Senator Travis , yesterday was the first corroboration of that part of Assistant District Attorney Elder 's story which referred to Gardner 's services in the distribution of the so-called bribery fund . It was the most promising lead the committee- had struck since Mr. Elder 's sensational disclosures were made a month ago . Senator Travis was the successor of Gardner in the State Senate . He was reelected this Fall . A Watermelon to be Cot . " One morning I- was sitting at my desk , " said he . " when one of the men I had seen around the Senate came to me and opened a general conversation . Final-ly he mentioned - the race track legislation . saying that more votes were needed ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juicy watermelon was to be cut . I told him my vote was already pledged for the bill , and 1 that ended the conversation . " Senator Travis explained that the man was a lobbyist whose name was unknown to him . " This same man came to me just before the bill came up and told me that Senator Gardner wanted to speak to me on the telephone . Senator Gardner was on the wire . He wanted me to come see him at the Hampton , but I . told him I would not go there , as I knew what he wanted . He told me that the amount previously mentioned would be paid . " Mr. Bruce wanted to know what amount had been mentioned and by whom . Senator Travis explained that just before he entered the telephone booth to talk with Gardner the mysterious lobbyist had told him that if he agreed to voteagainst the bill he would be paid $25,000 at once and $75,000 more either that evening or the morning after the Senate ' voted on the measure . " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Mr. Bruce . I was having breakfast with Senator Carpenter and Senator Fuller one - morning , and they told me that they had been approached , ' replied Travis . " Senator Gates also told me that ' he had been- approached as I had been , over the telephone . " The lobbyist whose . name he could not remember was described by Senator Travis as being about 5 feet 6 inches in height , with a thin black mustache , and of medium weight . He said he saw him several times after the anti-race track gambling bill passed , but . that he " did not see him at the last session of the Legisislature .

Mr. Bruce wanted to know the purpose of the association . which is generally referred to as the bookmakers ' organization . 1 " The original purpose was to improve the breed of horseS , " Said-Mr . Jones . who had quite a jaunty air . He . declared that 1 the association did not have any interests I in . race tacks or racing ' . stables - or I horses . ' Mr. Bruce asked-him how the as : // BRIBE 61 ? $100,000 OFFERED TO TRAVIS // ? sociation managed to improve the breed of horses . Mr. Jones pondered over that question more than a minute . Finally he replied : ' It 's a long story . I hardly know how to begin . " Another long pause and then : 1 " Well , at one time they contributed to a i ? to a fund through the racing associa1 tIon . " " Is that the end of the long story ? " asked Mr. Bruce with a smile . ? " That seems to be about all there is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile ' and looking greatly relieved . But Mr. ' Bruce had not finished with him . He wanted to know all about the operations of the bookmakers , and Mr. Jones told him that it used to be the custom for the association members to drop 300 tickets at $2 a ticket Into the contribution box at each racing meet . This sum he said was supposed to help pay the purses for the meet . " Why did you buy tickets instead of contributing the money direct ? " asked Mr. Bruce . " We assumed that we had the right to buy tickets , " was the reply . The present Secretary of the Metropoll ' tan Turf Association , said Mr. Jones , was Tim Sullivan , not Senator Timothy D. Sullivan , but another of that name . The association 's headquarters , he said , were at a clubhouse in West Forty-fifth Street . The books of the organization were presumably there . Only Lawyers Were Paid . Just as Mr. Jones thought he wassabout to leave the witness chair Mr. Bruce wanted to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the HartAgnew bill . Mr. Jones looked uneasy . " Well , you know I am under indictment , " he said . He denied that any assessment was made to defeat the antirace track gambling bill , " Well , was any money contributed by any one else personally , or did you make ' any personally , to - hire attorneys or in any other way to place the views of the association before the Legislature ? " in , sisted Mr. Bruce . " That 's a pretty broad question , " replied Mr. Jones . " The Executive Committee had very broad powers and had to I have lawyers sometimes and assessments for them . " Francis R. Hitchcock , Treasurer of the , Coney Island Jockey Club , followed Mr. Jones as a witness . There was a " Mr. Hitchcock " mentioned by Elder as having attended the meeting in Delmonico 's at which the half-million-dollar fund was subscribed . Mr. Hitchcock read a statement , explaining that a subpoena had been made out in the name of his brother , but that he supposed he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Hall to receive the subpoena and to testify ' voluntarily . Mr. Hitchcock said the Jockey ' Club had opposed the anti-race track gambling legislation . Mr. Bruce read him an extract from the testimony of Mr. Elder , mentioning him , or some other Mr. Hitchcock , as having attended the Delmonico meeting . Hobley Argued with Foelker. - T wish to ask you if you are the Mr. , Hitchcock who was present at that dinner ? " he asked . " No , " replied Mr. Hitchcock , and he adder : that , he knew of no action having ' been taken by the Coney Island Jockey Club in connection with the fight on the anti-race track gambling legislation . Ex-Sheriff Alfred T. Hobley of Kings County , who was defeated as the Republican candidate for Congress this Fall , was cross-questioned . He was Republican leader of the Fourth Senatorial District in Kings , and the district was represented by Foelker in 1908 . It will be remembered that ex-Quarantine Commissioner Frederick Schroeder , now a convict in Sing Sing , testified before the committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hand and get him to " vote right " on the HartAgnew bill . Mr. Hobley said that he had two talks with Foelker about the measure , one at the District Republican Club , another at Sta.atsburg , Y. , where Foelker was ill , just before the vete was taken . Hobley said he opposed the bill on the ground that it was a bad party measure and would make many enemies . He said he told Foelker so . In describing his visit to Staatsburg . HobleY said that he told Foelker that he I would imperil his re-election by voting for the bill . " I believe that the passage of that bill I cost the Republican Party a good many votes this last election , " said the ex ' Sheriff . That 's interesting and more or less painful , " remarked Mr. Bruce , and there was a general laugh . Denies What Schroeder Said . " I object to that statement of the witness , " exclaimed Chairman Merritt of the committee . " It did not cost the Republican Party any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told of a trip from Chicago just after the Republican National Convention in 1908 , when Hobley made remarks about Foelker 's having received money , then reyes , terday denied ever having said such a thing . and he read a letter he wrote to reenter two years ago denying the alleged remarks and saying that he always held Foelker in high esteem and considered him an honest man . ' He admitted having a conversation with Schroeder a bout the anti  --  race track Gambling bill . but said that Schroeder had come to him with the request that he influence Foelicer to vote against it . He denied Schroeder 's statement that he said on that occasion : " Leave him to me , " and said that Schroeder was mistaken when he said that ex-State Senator Conrad T-Tasenflug 's name was mentioned as likely in Influencing Foelker . " My only regret is that I did n't get the opportunity to testify before election , " said Mr. Hobley . Mr. Bruce suggested that his testimony would have been welcomed before election . " You had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " suggested the committee 's counsel . Yes , I have only myself to blame , " I replied Mr. Hobley . Hasenflug Denies It XII . Ex-State Senator Hasenflug had listened to Hobley 's testimony , and when the ' ex-Sheriff got through he took the witness chair and said that while he voted against the Hart-Agnew bill he had never been offered money to do so . He denied ever having called Schroeder on the telephone asking him to see Foelker . " You were interested in the defeat of the measure , were you not ? " asked Mr. Bruce . What do you mean ? " said Hasenflug . " You considered the measure not in the interest of the public ? " Well , I talked with many people in my district , and they were against the bill . Senator McCarren was also against it . That 's why I opposed it " He added that he had never talked to any member of the Metropolitan Turf Association about the bill against race I track gambling . 1 State Senator Alfred J. Gilchrist of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track legislation , or that he had ever been approached with ( any offer of a bribe . He voted against the bill , he said , because he - thought it " ineffective and injudicious . " He said , Itoo , that he doubted the whole story that money was paid to any legislator to kill the bill .
