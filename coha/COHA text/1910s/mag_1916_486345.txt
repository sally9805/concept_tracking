THE HAGUE , September 30 The Frankfurter Zeitung has always been noted for its disinterested love of Holland and the Dutch . Even in these expensive days of exorbitant paper prices , it devotes two long columns of its precious space to the disturbance in Djambi , a. district on the east coast of Sumatra , where the native population has risen in arms against the colonial authorities . The article was from the hand of a certain Dr. Max Roloff , " a fully competent judge " of Dutch colonial administration , according to the Frankfurter Zeitung , " as for nearly thirteen years he had been adviser to the Netherlands Government on matters touching the Islam " This blunder of the Frankfurter has caused great amusement to the Dutch , for every Hollander who is interested in his colonies could have told the German editor that , during the period in which Dr. Roloff was supposed to have held that important office , from 1895 to 1908 , no less a person than the famous orientalist Dr. C. Snouck Hurgronje was the official adviser of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportions when the real history of this " fully competent authority " was brought to light . In the year which , according to the Frankfurter Zeitung , marked the beginning of his advisory task , Dr Roloff enlisted as a subaltern officer in the Dutch colonial army . His knowledge of Arabic , acquired during two years ' service in the foreign legion in Algeria , might have helped him to a successful career , but in 1905 he had to appear before the court-martial on a charge of forgery and was sentenced to two years and ninety days ' confinement . That is the man who gets the disposal of two columns of a leading paper to enlighten the German reader on Dutch colonial affairs . It seems as if the present search for substitutes , to which German inventiveness is driven by the British blockade , is not limited to foodstuffs , but has to supply a deficiency of " Deutsches wissen. " as well . If one were to believe Dr. Roloff , the systematic mismanagement of the colonies is responsible for the revolt in Djambi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of bygone days , a copy of Multatuli 's brilliant but tendentious novel , " Max Havelaar " ( 1860 ) Colonial authorities in Holland do not deny that part of the responsibility for the Djambi riots rests on the Government , but that extortion and systematic starvation of the natives , as Dr. Roloff asserts , has driven them to revolt is a downright lie . Dutch officials have sinned by leniency and an unwarranted trust in the loyalty of a newly pacified population . Only so short a time ago as 1907 was Djambi , after six years of fighting , reduced to a state of order and peace . The rule of the Sultan , who until then had been left in power under governmental control , had to make place for direct administration by Dutth officials ; and four years later Resident Engelenburg could boast that Djambi had been reduced to order so far as to justify the abolition of various feudal rights and compulsory services which , before the war , had beenclaimed as their due by the native princes That step appears to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accustomed to slave for despotic masters , became unsettled , and the Government , by giving up all traditional control of native labor , lost its contact with the people it had to rule . Among a populace thus unsettled , preachers of discontent and revolt had an easy game . Fantastic rumors about the war in Europe and of Turkish successes stirred up the naive imagination of the people . They were told that two Turkish men-of-war had appeared within sight of the coast , ready to land Turkish troops at the first summons of the rebels . It is not clear yet from the telegrams whether the action of the " Sarekat Islam , " a native organization officially recognized by the Government , has had a hand in the matter . Dr. Roloff , better informed than any one in Holland , refuses to believe in Mohammedan or Turkish instigation , and adds the transparent hint that " the members of the former Sultan 's house are living , for the greater part , at Singapore , where they receive hospitality from the English . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollanders , whom the intrigues of Herr Kell in Java have made suspicious of German machinations , are to understand from Dr. Roloff 's insinuation that hypocrite John Bull is the real brewer of mischief in the Dutch archipelago . But the revelations in the Dutch press as to the antecedents of Herr Roloff are a sufficient antidote against the venom of his pen . The Djambi affair must not be regarded as a symptom of general discontent in the Dutch East Indies . Just a month ago , on August 31 , Queen Wilhelmina 's birthday , meetings were held in the principal towns of Java to demonstrate in favor of compulsory military service for both Europeans and natives , and representatives of the " Sarekat Islam " took an active part in these assemblies and supported the resolutions that were proposed . Not in all parts , indeed , of the Archipelago does the action of the " Sarekat Islam " run parallel with the wishes of the Government ; an all too zealous activity of the Christian mission under the auspices of the former Governor-General has challenged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no small amount of skill and Persuasion to allay the suspicions that have been raised in certain districts . An honest recognition of the native 's right to choose his own creed might easily dispel these suspicions , but the Protestant zealots at home , who would decry such an admission by the Government as a betrayal of Christianity , form a powerful party in the state which the Government can not ignore . I do not , therefore , urge the importance of the resolutions carried on August 31 ; but the events of that day have , at any rate , not demonstrated strong objections , on the part of the native population , to their taking a share in the defence of the country . That the duty of military service can not be imposed on the Javanese without a simultaneous grant of civil rights is naturally recognized by the advocates of this new course in colonial policy . What is to be the extent of these grants will be a difficult problem to solve , but the Netherlands Government is , evidently , not deterred by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road Major J. van der Weyden , of the General Staff of the Netherlands Indian army , the chief advocate and writer of a book on " Compulsoryservice for natives and the constitution of our defensive power in the Dutch East Inches , " has just sailed for Batavia , for the express purpose , it is supposed , of paving the way for a military organization as proposed by him in the above-mentioned book . Forecasts of the total failure of his plans have naturally accompanied his departure . Your correspondent , Mr. J. F. Scheltema , who , in a letter to the Nation of July 20 , expressed his disbelief in the realization of the noble intentions aired at The Hague , shares his skepticism with a great many of his countrymen . Greed and sloth are , indeed , the besetting sins of the European capitalist in the tropics , and his egoism and inertia are a drag on all progress . But does not the skeptic , while recognizing the need of reform , make himself the accomplice of the greedy and the slothful by submitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly fact of their obstructing power ? Drystubble , that odious incarnation , created by Multatuh , of Dutch mercantilism , is still alive , but why is a belief in the ultimate defeat of his selfish aims to be derided as grandiloquent enthusiasm ? VENIZELOS LEAVES ATHENS ? THE KING 'S WORD ? THE GREEK ISLANDS ? AN OPPORTUNISTIC EDITOR . By JOHIN A. HITYBERS ATHENS , September 27 . At last the great step has been taken and Venizelos has placed himself at the head of the revolutionary movement for national defence . Athens has been strangely quiet since the news became known , on September 25 , of his departure from the Phaleron in the early hours before dawn for Crete . With him went Admiral Coundouriotis , commander-in-chief of the fleet . The quiet that reigns in Athens shows that something unusual has happened ; silence has fallen even on the usually noisy caf  --  s . The news is greedily read , but people are afraid to commit themselves , and publicly give no voice to their real feelings . It is a time of suspense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now develop . That Coundouriotis should be with Venizelos is a heavy blow to the prestige of the King , for if Venizelos to his followers represents the brains , honesty , and strength of purpose of the Greek race , Coundouriotis , without distinction of party , represents to all Greeks the fighting qualities of their race and the best of their navy , of which they are rightly proud . His life has been devoted to service , not to politics , and his name has the glamour and carries the weight of that of a naval hero in Great Britain , or that of a Dewey after the battle of Manila with the American public . For Coundouriotis with the Greek navy played a most distinguished part in the war with Turkey , and he remains one of the popular heroes to-day . At the earnest request of the King , he was Minister of Marine in the Skouloudis Cabinet , but took little part in its councils and professed open contempt for its policy . More than seventy officers of all grades left Athens during the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Defence in Macedonia . On the Atromitos , which carried Venizelos and Coundouriotis , was Mr. Embirikos , the largest ship-owner in Greece , who has dedicated his fortune to the national cause . On the Atromitos and Hesperia went , besides the chiefs , Miaoulis , former Minister of Marine , three naval captains , Brigadier-General Comninos , two superior officers of the First Regiment , the King 's own , of which the Crown Prince is second in command , and many superior officers of all grades . Mr. Venizelos made a statement to the Patris , published the following day . Abbreviated , I quote it as follows : " The struggle we begin to-day does not for the moment assume a movement against the Constitution . I have exhausted all legal means to induce action . We are obliged to form a provisional government , not to abolish the state of things in Athens , but to organize our military forces to defend Greek Macedonia . A schism in. our national unity will be deplored , but the only chance to preserve it is the course I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macedonia to the enemy . I will fight to preserve it the national unity . The proof of my intentions is the fact that I establish national action only where the partisans of my ideas are in the absolute majority . I thus exclude the cause for civil war  --  the state of things established in Athens remains the same . If they persist in their actual path , we will fight to save Greece without them . If they join us , we will be with them side by side . I leave as a soldier who , after vainly persuading his companions , does not turn his arms against them , but takes his arms to fight the enemy " One of the Liberal papers publishes in large text at the head of its columns the words of the oath which the King of Greece took on ascending the throne . No editorial comment follows ; the readers are left to judge for themselves in the face of the events of last year and to-day how far that oath has been kept : I swear , in the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect the dominant religion of the Hellenes , to guard the Constitution and the laws of the Hellenic nation , and to preserve and defend the national independence and integrity of the Hellenic state . On September 20 the year 's recruits took their oath before the King . As much ceremony as possible had been lent to the occasion , but the King , by the address he made to the recruits , converted the ceremony into one of the scenes of the tragi-comedy that is being siayed in Greece to-day . Here are the words of the oath : I swear : to keep faith to my country and to the constitutional King of the Hellenes ; obedience to the Constitution , to the laws and decrees of the state ; submission to my superiors , to execute willingly and without explanation the commands of my superiors ; to defend with faith and devotion and to the last drop of my blood , the flag , never to abandon nor separate myself from it ; to observe strictly the military laws , and to conduct myself at all times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the address the King made to the young soldiers : Recruits ! By the oath which you have taken , you have become soldiers of the Fatherland , soldiers of the King , my soldiers . ( n-Tparu2rrat taiKoi pen ) You must conduct yourselves always as faithful soldiers , you must have faith in your superiors and through them in your King . But faith alone is not sufficient . A blind devotion is necessary to the will of your superiors and through your superiors to your King . When every soldier does what he wishes and believes the country wants , then alas for that army and the country which has such an army . You will hear them say many things to you them includes Venizelos , the Liberal party , the Liberal press , and all opposed to the King 's doctrines only to mislead you , but do not believe them , because they sell their patriotism and are traffickers in their country . They wish to commit crimes which they hide under the mantle of patriotism . Do not believe them . You enter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditions , and you will impregnate yourself with its spirit and devotion , and do not forget the things I have said to you . Do not forget my words Long live the army ! More injudicious words could hardly have been spoken at the present time , but the King and Queen drove away , content with the applause of the thoughtless , and unaware of the bad impression and unfavorable comments that a wider publicity would bring . The Patris , a Liberal paper , speaking of the King 's address on the following morning , said : " The soldiers swore faith to their country and to their constitutional King and to the flag . All these elevated precepts with the religious ceremony attending spoke in the deepest sense of the army being the armed force of the nation , that it is the instrument at the disposal of the national will , of that will of which the King is but the first exponent in a constitutionally organized State . But after the soldiers had taken the oath , they were to learn from the King that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the personal service of the King , ' his soldiers ' dependent on him alone and owing him an exclusive and blind obedience . " The Messager criticises the King severely for his effort to make of the army a Prmtorian . Guard , and for his reference to the political men who have made Greece what it is , as barterers of patriotism and traffickers of their country . So it was with all the Liberal papers . For the base note of personal adulation and flattery we must turn to the Embros : " The King spoke again yesterday to the army , the King , handsome , iron-souled , with the lion 's courage , near His army , His old fighters , His heroes , His noble war companions , to the army of recruits , His new army which proudly enters the iron-souled family ready with their blood to water the incorruptible laurels of ' ilk 's . " The King spoke ! And now His voice was caressing , now trumpet-tongued and thunder-voiced . Most caressing were the words of the King-Father to His own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice His kingly lungs breathed into the chests of the recruits the clarion tones of faith and devotion , the clarion of duty , the clarion of national life . But thunder-tongued was His voice as He denounced the barterers of patriotism , the traffickers in their country , those who have forgotten the oath that the recruits took yesterday . " In the midst of His army , preUminent in courage , in beauty  --  as a light , as a flame yesterday , stood the King . " There is much more to the same effect . A little of this may be amusing to the American reader , more might be nauseous . The writer of the panegyric ends by getting so tangled up that it becomes difficult to trace the subject , predicate , direct and indirect complement . All pronouns referring to the King personally are spelled with a capital letter , as if speaking of the Deity . It is difficult to understand how such a paper has a wide circle of readers among people who are sincere in their daily duties . The irritation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger 's judgment , and he reads with a momentary acquiescence a wicked little vocabulary published in an Italian paper that has just reached Athens . Greek .

All this may apply to the Greece of the King and his followers , to the Greece of the venal press , but what is most representative of the best in the country , what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the rest , remains untouched by this skit . In. the report in the Liberal papers of a recent interview given by the King to the correspondent of the Associated Press , surprise is expressed at his Majesty 's lack of candor in saying : " It is not for me alone to decide what to do in the present juncture of affairs . It is a question for the Greeks in Thrace and Asia-Minor and the islands to arrive at a decision after having carefully weighed the frightful price to be paid in case of war . " The King knows full well that the price has been paid without the chance or opportunity of redemption having been offered ; the thousands of refugees who have arrived from Thrace and Asia-Minor could have informed him of that . Of the 360,000 Greeks in Thrace before the war , but 50,000 remain . The official statistics of the oecumenical patriarchate in Constantinople , dealing with the short period between April and August in 1915 , show that in the districts contiguous to the Sea of Marmora and the Straits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 76,289 ; a complementary list for the peninsula brings the number to over 100,000 . After the young men who remained had been incorporated in the Turkish army the old people , women , and children were deported into the interior of Asia-Minor , despoiled of their property . In the districts to the north and south of Smyrna facing Mytilene , Samos , and Chios more than 100,000 were deported into the interior . I myself saw the arrival at the Pirmus of hundreds of refugees from the coasts of Asia-Minor in . December last year , women and children belonging to a fine race , superior in appearance to a similar number that might be gathered at random in Athens . And nothing struck one more painfully than the apparent indifference of the Athenians to the wanderers . The same scenes have been repeated recently in the case of refugees , women and children , from Eastern Macedonia . What the islands think has been shown by the spread of the revolutionary movement there and in Crete . The text of the resolution voted at the great meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of commission of nine former Liberal Deputies and signed by them . Copies were transmitted by telegraph to the King , the Government , Mr. Venizelos , and the Ministers of the Entente . The manifesto from Mytilene , in common with the islands of Chios , Samoa , Icaria ( somewhat abbreviated ) , is as follows : " Faithful to our native land , to Greece , to the traditions of our nation and race which we have preserved for five hundred years , and profoundly conscious owing to our recent liberation of our duties towards our country and race , we take measure of the enormous evils that have resulted from the recent national policy . We disavow with indignation that policy pursued by the Gounaris-Skouloudis Ministry , whose criminal character where our national interests were concerned has been clearly demonstrated . We declare ourselves earnestly , conjointly with the great majority of the country , in favor of the national policy of Venizelos , and we place ourselves by the side of the three protecting Powers , to whom we are attached by the traditions and interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour a last call to U. M. the King , we pray him to conform to the true sentiments of the nation , and to preach with loud voice the national unity , concentrating all the forces of the nation for the realization of that programme which the will of the nation imposes , and to the triumph of which his action will be the first pledge . " We appeal to the King , as the representative of national unity , to avoid the great disaster which would fatally result by the division of that unity . The nation can not follow a policy contrary to its deepest feelings and one that tolerates in Macedonia the presence of the hated enemy . " We declare ourselves one with those Greeks who see before all else the country invaded and who make of all other obligations but its defence a secondary obligation . " A few days ago the Athenian papers recorded the arrest of the editor of the Palingenesia , of Heraklion , Crete . A letter by Mr. R. M. Dawkins , an English archologist , gives some details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question made a proposal to the English naval commander concerning a change of policy in the conduct of his paper . He stated that the German Legation paid him a lump sum of 24,000 francs , and a monthly subsidy of a thousand francs to pursue a Germanophile campaign in his paper ; that after the war an anti-English propaganda was to be continued and his paper was to be one of the organs of that propaganda ; that if he changed the policy of his paper suddenly , he would lose his readers ; but that if given five weeks he would modify the policy of the paper so that at the end of that time it would be entirely in the English interest . But it was necessary to know if he should be required only to support the Entente , or if he must give his support to Venizelos at the same time . In the latter case the Penngenesia would demand a higher compensation . To facilitate operations , however , he was willing to accept that compensation in kind instead of coin , and asked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the profits was to be turned over to some anti-Venizelist Deputies , relatives of his . He demanded , as soon as the arrangement was completed , a permit to import 250 tons of rice , 250 tons of barley , and 10,000 empty Calcutta sacks , with a special permit to import weekly 60 tons of general merchandise . As soon as his conditions were accepted , his paper should become the official organ of English interests . He made the same proposals to the naval second-in-command of the English fleet in the presence of Mr. Dawkins . When they remarked that the desired change in his opin , ions was due to the withdrawal of Baron Schenck from Athens he stated that he had in his hands the month 's draft for 1,000 francs and he would not give up the Germans till he had come to an agreement with the English . The conclusion was unexpected ; on his own showing he was an active member of the German propaganda and his arrest followed . The Pcaingenesia is awaiting its editor and his relatives must turn elsewhere for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Having worked so long and faithfully for others , William Frank McCombs has been trying this season to do something really worth while on his own account . Widely varying estimates of his chances of success float into Washington , but all agree that , whatever the ultimate outcome , he will have made a highly creditable run , and that , if he gets the coveted Senatorship , he will have nobody to thank for it but himself For he is running , not on the record of the Democratic party as a whole , or of President Wilson as an . individual , but on his own record of success four years ago , when the Presidential race was everybody 's till he came into it with his good horse system . As the first successful campaign manager his party had known for sixteen years , he was in line for about any important office he wished under the new Administration , and the common expectation was that he would be the next Postmaster-General . He would have made a good one , for the postal establishment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Treasury , and business methods are McCombs 's specialty . Instead of that , the glittering gift of the Embassy to France was offered to him and declined . The declination was ostensibly based on the expense to which he would be put in Paris , and the prolonged absence from his country and his law practice which would be necessary ; underneath everything lurked , I suspect , his consciousness that diplomacy , with its labyrinth of secret features , was not the most attractive occupation for a man who has always worked above-ground and whose special strength he s in this methodical use of material open to every one . Although , technically speaking , Woodrow Wilson was first named as a Presidential candidate at Baltimore , in the summer of 1912 , actually he dates his start in the race a good deal further back , for McCombs , as a student of political history and economics in the class of 1898 at Princeton , had picked out his favorite professor as a " coming man " with the same assurance that characterized Daniel Lamont 's recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buffalo ; and the friendship formed in the classroom was kept up actively after the younger man 's graduation , his course in law , and his upbuilding of a practice in New York . Meanwhile , conditions in Democratic politics were ripening for a new departure . Bryan the brass bound and Parker the timid had had their day , and the great body of intelligent Democrats were clamoring for candidates who could cut loose from the old leaders and the old standards and modernize the party . McCombs read the signs aright , and prepared to take advantage of them . He saw that a fresh generation of voters were coming into the foreground of affairs . and that everything depended upon a successful appeal to them . He- knew a great many of them , scattered over the country , and to these he wrote , expressing his views of the situation and his hopes for the future . Their responses he analyzed , entering on a white index-card the name and address of every correspondent who agreed with him , and on a colored card those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cards he filed in their proper order , in a cabinet , till he had within reach of his hand a pretty complete directory of the live young men who were Democrats , near-Democrats , forward - looking independents , and uncertain but possible recruits of every stripe , in the United States , running up well into the hundreds of thousands . When a circular letter or document was to be mailed , or an inquiry to be made , in a certain neighborhood , or an emissary was to be sent there to do active canvassing , McCombs had the local map before him , as it were , and could direct his energies intelligently for producing the surest results This was the way be prepared for and handled the Baltimore opportunity , and landed this man at the head of the party ticket . This was the way he conducted the subsequent campaign . It was by this guide , also , that he was able to distinguish between the real " Wilson , men " and the make-believes , when a host of claimants , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was Lamont 's general method repeated , but with a less crude mechanism . It was also quite in keeping with the personality of its author , which has not a taint of spasmodic emotion in it . His face , with prominent nose , its strong jaw , its wide , full mouth , and its winged eyebrows , impresses you with its seriousness in repose ; only when it lights up with a smile  --  a phase never overworked  --  do you see it at its best . His unconscious trick of looking at you out of the corners of his eyes would , if you did not know the kindness of his nature , make you think he was suspicious of your motives ; but when you notice that the lines in his forehead intensify with this movement , you realize that he is merely trying to make sure of your meaning . He is not an effusive talker , but a prize listener . On the platform he is a ready speaker , free from explosiVeness . In what are commonly styled the arts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern man all through , born in Missouri forty-one years ago , of Kentucky-Alabama parentage , and started on his educational course in a Tennessee school . His Southern-ness permeates his speech , which , in spite of his twenty years in the North , still retains some of the slurring consonants and gentle drawl of his ancestral section . All that he says , however , is matter-of-fact in form , logical in presentation , sane in sentiment , and pleasantly expressed ; indeed , it was his amiable temper and agreeable manner which , in his university days , made him a social favorite in spite of his inability , due to an injury of his childhood which left him permanently lame , to join his mates in their athletic sports . If McCombs reaches the Senate , we shall hear more of him as a committee worker and a general pilot of legislation than as a brilliant performer on the floor . He may not prove a Webster , or an Edmunds , or a Root ; but as a legislator of practical usefulness and a debater with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that he will do New York at least as much credit as Mr. O'Gorman , and probably a good deal more .
