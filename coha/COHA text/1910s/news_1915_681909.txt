txt How the Guard Benefits Employers . Being myself a member of the National Guard and in a position to realize the truth of the statements made in your recent editorial " Employers and Militiamen , " I wonder whether space could be allowed me in your paper to bring to the attention of such employers the following : A man who is a member of the National Guard for five years is exempt from jury duty . During that period of five years his duties as a member of the Guard require that he shall go twice to camp , which means that he must be excused from his occupation for a week each time , and to addition must devote one day a year to rifle practice . That makes a total of nineteen days in five years . The ordinary citizen is liable for two weeks ' jury duty each year , or a total of ten weeks in five years . Leaving patriotism aside , as a purely business proposition , does n't the above show a net saving of time for the employer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Why ca n't they see it ?
