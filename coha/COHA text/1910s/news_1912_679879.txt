txt Why a Federal Child Bureau ? Miss Wald Is quite In error if she thinks that opposition to the bill for a Federal Child Bureau Is confined to Mr. Gerry , Mr. Stillman , and their personal friends . They have merely voiced the disgust of a silent multitude of stanch Americans who believe the country would be helped by a stronger sense of personal responsibility , and that the establishment Of National bureaus and organizations does not stimulate this needed quality . That the Government looks after animals and plants is precisely a reason why It should not look after children . In a democratic state man Is regarded as responsible for the existence of his offspring , and when he neglects his duty to them it would do vastly more good for those In his vicinity to hold up to scorn as a coward or to march him individually to jail than to establish paid societies to minimize his offense and distribute It upon the shoulders of " social conditions .
