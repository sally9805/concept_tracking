 | The stupendous events and the far-reaching effects of the Great War appall and bewilder the human mind . In modern times the advanced development of international trade and international relations has tended more and more to make the whole world one community with all the civilized states interdependent and bound together by a complicated network of interests . Suddenly came a shock which disrupted international relations , destroyed facilities for communication and commerce , cut off producers of raw materials from their markets , deprived factories of the normal demand for their output , and called millions of men from the ranks of industry to the field of arms . In some of the most populous and prosperous regions of the world , production gave place to destruction . The catastrophe was in truth " civilization 's suicide . " Happily the people of the United States are far removed from the scenes of desperate and bloody struggle in which nations are making prodigal sacrifice of property and lives . But we are not unconcerned with the conflict . Perhaps we may not come off unscarred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whatever the future may hold for us , the war has already produced widespread effects upon the welfare of our people . Though any review of such effects must necessarily be provisional and incomplete , facts are already available to throw some light upon the war 's influence upon American industry and commerce .  | Certainly the war has dealt a heavy blow to the cotton producing states of the South . From their farms and plantations came , in 1913 , about 61% of all the cotton grown in the world ; India produced 17% of the year 's yield , Egypt 7% , China 5% , and other countries the remainder . Though our textile industries are important and growing , the greater part of the cotton produced in the United States is exported to Europe . Fortunately for the purpose of comparing the marketing of the 1913 and the 1914 crops , the cotton year was about ended at the beginning of the war . Trade reports of the movement of the staple for the year were practically complete . The total crop of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bales , and it was sold at an average price of about thirteen cents a pound . We exported to all other countries in the fiscal year which ended last summer about 9,500,000 bales for which we received approximately 8610,000,000 . Out of the 9,500,000 bales exported , 8,000,000 bales went to six European countries which engaged in war last August . They were our best customers . In 1913 they consumed about fifty per cent of all the cotton used in the world . Of the crop of that year the United Kingdom , France , Belgium , and Russia bought more than 5,000,000 bales from us . Germany and AustriaHungary took a little less than 3,000,000 bales . In short , these six countries bought of our 1913 crop cotton to the value of over $500,000,000 , and the proceeds , distributed over the South , entered and quickened all the departments of trade and industry . If , prior to last August , there were those who thought that our people could live independent of , and undisturbed by , the quarrels of other nations , their confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer advanced the South looked forward to picking one of the largest ? as it turned out the very largest ? crop of cotton in her history . Prospects were bright for great returns even at moderate prices . But suddenly the news came that our best customers had gone to war , and that the regular channels of international trade were obstructed or closed . At home there was dullness and depression ; abroad our markets were to a large degree lost . We had  | page deleted  | days before the outbreak of war , October cotton was selling in New York at over twelve cents a pound . On July 31 prices fell so badly that the Cotton Exchange suspended trading . When the crop was picked , prices offered to those who were obliged to sell displayed much local fluctuation , ranging in some sections around seven cents a pound . Naturally every grower who could possibly hold his cotton for higher prices decided to do so . The philanthropic " Buy a bale " movement was started to aid those who must sell , and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pound . Here we come to the widespread effects of the cotton situation upon the prosperity of the whole South . With most of the crop remaining in the hands of the growers and with the balance sold at low prices , the usual stream of goods and dollars which flows into the South to pay for the crop was cut off . The planters were unable to pay debts contracted for merchandise , fertilizers , and supplies . Economy was the rule . They had no money to buy new goods from the merchants . In turn , the merchants had to reduce their orders to wholesalers and manufacturers . The cotton being held and not shipped North and to the seaports , the railroads lost freight revenues both on the outgoing cotton and on supplies and merchandise coming in . Thus the war brought severe depression to the whole economic life of the cotton states . Conditions were made manifest in the alarming decrease of the revenues of the great railroads and industrial corporations of the South . Many of them were forced to pass or ' reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected were the Southern Railway , the Seaboard Air Line , the Atlantic Coast Line , the Louisville and Nashville Railroad , and the Virginia-Carolina Chemical Company . Naturally the loss of income was embarrassing to many investors in the securities of such enterprises . Various plans were brought forward to help the cotton growers through their time of difficulty . The " Buy a bale " movement has already been mentioned . Measures were urged upon Congress and the state legislatures for governmental  | loans or aid . Leading society women undertook to make cotton dress fabrics fashionable and to promote the sale of all sorts of cotton products by holding cotton shows . The Secretary of the Treasury ruled in favor of the acceptance of warehouse receipts representing cotton as security for the issue of emergency circulation under the Aldrich-Vreeland act . The banks of the country organized a pool of $135,000,000 to be loaned against cotton stored in warehouses . But owing to the cumbersome regulations for the administration of this loan fund and also to the increase of other credit facilities , an insignificant amount was actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of 1915 the cotton situation was greatly improved . The New York Cotton Exchange re-opened in the middle of November . Greater credit facilities became available to persons who wished to carry or buy cotton . The government provided a system of war risk insurance on American vessels and their cargoes , and by January there was great activity in the exportation of cotton to European countries . The total cotton exports from the United States in January , 1915 , were 1,372,175 running bales as compared with 1,052,272 for the same month of 1914 ; but for the six months ended January 31 , 1915 , the exports were 3,978,329 bales as compared with 6,489,752 bales in the corresponding months of the previous year . Thus the exportation for about half of the present cotton trade year runs about 2,500,000 bales behind the corresponding period of last year . Just now the extreme naval measures taken by Germany and Great Britain make prospects for safe exportation in the immediate future somewhat dubious . However , large credit facilities and the great movement of cotton in January and February have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton and upon the prices offered for it . Since January 1 middling upland cotton has reached in New York a price as high as eight and seventenths cents a pound , and the current price March 1 was about eight and one-third cents . The actual marketing of considerable quantities of cotton even at low prices has materially improved business conditions in the South . Indirectly the South may benefit from the prevailing depression in the cotton trade  | by the incentive given to a more diversified agriculture . The high prices realized this year for grain crops are promoting an increase of the acreage in wheat and corn and a reduction of the cotton acreage . It is to be hoped that the present impetus to diversification in agriculture will have a lasting effect . In contrast with the war 's depressing effect upon the South has been the prosperity brought to the wheat farmers of the West and Northwest . Like the cotton crop , the wheat crop was the largest on record . This great crop came in a year when , on the whole , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below normal . Our crop is estimated at 891,000,000 bushels , or 128,000,000 bushels larger than the crop of 1913 . With the prospect of this huge crop , about ten days before the beginning of the war September wheat sold at 67 or 68 cents a bushel in Chicago . By September 4 the price had advanced to $1.21 a bushel . Later as the crop came to market , wheat prices declined somewhat , but speculation and heavy purchases for export resulted in a high price of $1.67 for May wheat on February 5 . Recently there have been recessions in price , perhaps due in part to government investigations , but especially marked since there has been a prospect that the fleet of the Allies may force the Dardanelles and finally open the way for Russia 's surplus wheat to reach foreign markets from the ports of the Black Sea . Prior to the present year , the largest exports of domestic wheat from the United States occurred in 1902 , when the total was nearly 234,800,000 bushels . Our total available supply of wheat for the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agriculture , was 967,000,000 bushels , consisting of this year 's production of 891,000,000 bushels and 76,000,000 carried over from last year 's crop . Domestic consumption , including seeding , will require 610,000 , - 000 bushels , leaving an exportable surplus of 357,000,000 bushels . Up to the end of January 210,000,000 bushels had been exported . Unless Russian wheat supplies become available at an early date through the opening of the Dardanelles and the Bosporous , it seems probable that the total exports for the year ending June 30 next will be much in excess of 300 , - 000,000 bushels . What remains matter for speculation is the  | exact extent of the export demand of the next few months and its effect on prices . Extraordinarily high prices for wheat were not reached until the major portion of the 1914 wheat crop was no longer held by the farmers . The great profits accruing to holders of grain will in large measure enrich middlemen and speculators . On December 1 , 1914 , the average price of wheat at the farm was 98 cents a bushel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high price of $1.15 . The actual producers of the wheat parted with most of it before it commanded the very high prices of January and February . However , a great many millions of bushels of wheat have been sold by growers at prices ranging above $1.30 . The Department of Agriculture estimates that the wheat reserves remaining on farms March 1 amounted to 152,900,000 bushels . Although recent advances in wheat prices have been for the most part of benefit to the speculators and middlemen , the earlier influence of the war upon the markets gave the farmers a very substantial increase in their returns on the crop . In the middle of December ? before the greatest advance in prices had occurred ? the Department of Agriculture estimated that the value of the 1914 wheat crop was $878,680,000 as compared with $610,122,000 in 1913 . The difference is an indication of the extent of the gain to the farmers . Their good fortune has brought prosperity and business activity to extensive sections of the West and Northwest . While the rest of the country has suffered from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at such points as Kansas City , Minneapolis , and St. Paul have during the fall and winter been running ahead of those of last year , indicating an active state of business . While railroads in other sections have been reducing or deferring their dividends , the railroads of the wheat country have either been increasing their earnings or maintaining them fairly well in the face of otherwise adverse circumstances . Such a railroad as the Atchison , Topeka , and Santa Fe , which serves Kansas and other wheat growing territory , has shown an increase over last year of fifteen per cent in net earnings for the seven months ended January 31 . A leading statistical organization canvassed 128 cities of the United States and  | reported to its mercantile clients in February that there was an increase in business in 22 cities as compared with last year . The following cities it reported as offering " especial oppor-tunities for business compared with other cities of the same size " : Aberdeen , S. D. , Duluth , Minn. , Fargo , N. D. , Kansas City , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Omaha , Neb. and Wichita , Kan . All of these unusually prosperous cities are in the wheat growing sections . The war , in causing high wheat prices , has increased the cost of living for the people of the whole country . An increase of one cent a bushel in the price of wheat means an increase of four or five cents in the price of flour per barrel . In communities where early in the fall high grade flour retailed at from $6.00 to $6.50 a barrel it is now sold at $8.50 or $9.00 . A natural consequence is either an increase in the price of baker 's bread or lighter loaves at the old price . Thus an in-jurious effect of the war is manifest in nearly every household . Not even the consumer of corn bread escapes . The substitution for wheat of corn and other grains increases the demand for them and causes their prices to advance . Large quantities of corn and oats have also been purchased for exportation . So widespread are the effects of higher grain prices that it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigate all the circumstances surrounding the advance of wheat to discover whether or not it has been ' promoted by artificial and unlawful means . Sugar is another commodity whose producers have profited and whose consumers have suffered loss as a result of the war. * In the spring of 1914 refined granulated sugar sold in New York at less than four cents a pound and raw sugar at less than three cents a pound with the duty paid . These were the lowest prices in over a decade . The Cuban crop last year was over 2,500,000 tons , and our domestic beet sugar crop was about 655,000 tons ? both the largest on record . In addition there was a supply of duty free sugar from Louisiana , Porto Rico , Hawaii , and the Philippines which brought the  | page deleted  | producers have a respite from the depressing effects of the gradual removal of the sugar tariff . Cuba with a large crop a c that will be sold at high prices will probably experience exceptional prosperity . This will doubtless enable her to make unusually large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our country an indirect benefit . an : It is possible to make only brief reference to a number of other American industries that have been especially affected by the war . The United States is a large exporter of oils , and the effect of the war upon this trade was instantaneous . As in the case of the cotton industry , important markets were closed . There was doubt as to the position of oil as a contraband of war . Many tank steamer fleets were under foreign registry and flags . Some oil carrying steamers were stopped and taken into English ports . In the face of this situation , the great refineries along the Atlantic sea coast restricted their output and lowered the price paid for crude oil to the producers . Later , progress was made in resuming export trade in petroleum products , although of course the business is subject to the uncertain conditions of wartime . Some tank steamers have been transferred from foreign to American registry , and new steamers have been put into the oil trade . It does not appear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced price paid for crude oil . Other mineral products , whose market has been affected by the war , are copper and coal . About half of the copper produced in the United- States is sold in Europe . Since copper is an important material in the manufacture of ammunition , the war involved much interference with the export trade , especially to Germany . The current price of copper about July the eighteenth was $.13875 per pound . The war caused a fall in prices , and about the end of September copper was selling for $.125 a pound . In recent months large quantities of copper have been sent to Europe and the current price early in March was $.1475 . At the outbreak of the war England put an embargo on the exportation of Welsh coal . This resulted in an increased demand for American coal from foreign quarters , notably South American countries and southern Europe . Later  | the embargo on Welsh coal was lifted , but the war has given a considerable stimulus to the export of American coal . The textile industries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal tar dye stuffs . There are no physical obstacles to securing in this country an abundant supply of coal tar and of its constituents used in the manufacture of dye stuffs . But the dye manufacturing industry involves a great number of patents and secret processes , and the production of a very large number of colors is required . Hitherto we have been content to rely upon the Germans for our supply . Speedy establishment of this industry in the United States would be difficult without the aid of scientific experts from abroad . The German dye factories are located along the Rhine , and their product is exported in times of peace through Antwerp and Rotterdam . When the war broke out , Germany at first placed an embargo on dye stuffs . Certain shipments to the United States were on the way , but during the period from August 15 to September 15 practically no dye stuffs were received . American textile manufacturers were much embarrassed . Representative H. A. Metz of New York made a special trip to Germany on behalf of industries in need of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dyes , and arrangements were made to ship them through Holland . But later , when it was found that dyes were being re-exported from the United States to England , Germany renewed the embargo in modified form . An arrangement was finally made whereby Germany permitted the export of fixed monthly amounts of dye stuffs presumed to be no more than necessary for the immediate needs of manufacturers who had contracts . Recently Secretary Lane of the Department of the Interior has announced the discovery by Dr. Walter F. Rittman , chemical engineer of the Bureau of Mines , of improved processes for obtaining derivatives of coal tar necessary for the dye industry and for the manufacture of high explosives . These processes are believed to be of great importance for the future development of such industries in the United States . However , manufacturing chemists have expressed the opinion that the commercial application of Dr. Rittman 's processes is likely to be a matter of several years work .  | page deleted  | to Europe has brought about a revival of shipbuilding , and every shipyard in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foregoing review of the effect of the war upon various American industries is by no means exhaustive ; many interesting and important examples have doubtless escaped comment . It is , however , clear that the influence of the war has been far reaching and that it has largely affected the welfare of many millions of Americans . The purchases made for export to Europe have created a great balance of trade in our favor . During the early weeks of the war ? before our cotton , wheat and other products began to reach foreign markets ? we were greatly in debt to Europe for an excess of imports over exports , for travelers ' expenses , and for other obligations . England was calling on us to pay , and our financiers were puzzled how to provide gold to settle the balance against us . Foreign exchange sold at remarkably high figures . One expedient to meet the situation was the raising by bankers throughout the country of the $100,000,000 gold fund and the transfer of gold from this fund to an agency of the Bank of England at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were enabled to sell London exchange which the Bank of England caused to be honored by banks in London . Now everything is changed . We are selling food , arms , and clothing to the people of the fighting nations . Our goods are piled up in warehouses at the seaports waiting for ships to carry them to Europe . Ocean freight rates on wheat and other important products are four or five times as high as a year ago . Hence President Wilson 's unsuccessful attempt to secure the passage by Congress of a government ship purchase bill as an emergency measure . In August , the first month of the war , our imports were $19,400,000 greater than our exports . But this condition was soon reversed . In September we exported $16,300,000 more than we imported . Since then , our monthly exports have exceeded our imports by the following amounts : October , $56 , - 600,000 ; November , $79,400,000 ; December , $131,900,000 ; January , $145,500,000 , and the volume of exports is still swelling . Press reports state that on Wednesday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York exceeded $10,000,000 ,  | the largest sum ever recorded in a single day in the history of the customs house . Normally Europe would have to ship large quantities of gold to the United States to make payment for the rapidly accumulating excess of our exports . Sterling exchange has been recently selling in New York at prices lower than ever before . These prices would make gold imports very certain and profitable under ordinary circumstances . But at present the warring nations are clinging to their gold reserves desperately , and the risks of shipping the metal are great . How is Europe then to pay the ever increasing debt for American goods ? Certainly not by sending us manufactures and other products in increased quantities ; that is impossible under present circumstances . Temporarily European nations are financing their purchases in the United States by arranging short time loans and credits with New York bankers . In this way payment is being made for part of the goods taken for export . Both warring and neutral nations are borrowing in New York . Important loans arranged in recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $5,000,000 to Sweden , $15 , - 000,000 to the Argentine Republic , $3,000,000 to Norway , $15 , - 000,000 to Switzerland , and there are rumors of large loans or extensions of credit to England and Italy . In addition to the above , the placing in New York o f more than $50,000,000 in Canadian provincial and municipal loans is evidence of that city 's increased importance as an international monetary center . Issues of Canadian traction and industrial bonds have also been sold in New York . In meeting these financial requirements of our northern neighbors we are taking the place of London . Doubtless these temporary loans and credits given by American bankers to foreign countries will later be settled by the transfer of securities in one form or another . A portion of foreign indebtedness to the United States may be offset by the sending to this country for sale of American bonds and stocks now held by European investors . English holders of South American and Canadian securities may sell them in this country . If the war ends or if our neutrality does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will possibly offer to SOME EFFECTS OF THE EUROPEAN WAR 115  | American creditors long term bonds in settlement of the temporary obligations at present outstanding . If our investors become the owners of such foreign securities , the interest due upon them will become a future item to our credit in computing the international trade balance . Experts believe that for the calendar year 1915 there will be a balance in our favor of at least $600,000,000 ? and probably very much more . This estimate takes into consideration both the visible and the invisible factors that affect the balance . Foreign countries must find a way of satisfying our claim to this large amount . The war has had , and will have , other far-reaching effects upon the economic life of the United States . The closing of the stock exchanges , the decline in the value of standard securities , the probable effect upon the interest rate and its consequences , the derangement of our federal system of taxation , the new openings made for American trade in South America and elsewhere ? all these suggest matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide a field provides abundant material for other occasions and is beyond the compass of a single essay . Enough has doubtless been said to show how greatly our welfare is involved in that of the other civilized peoples of the world and how profoundly the people of the United States are affected by any violent rupture of the fabric of international economic and social relations .
