 | THERE is no Democratic party , " observes one of its pillars , " and Bryan is its leader . " Owing to its dissensions and disorganization during the past few years , it is common enough to gibe at the Democratic party ; and yet it is everywhere conceded by thoughtful men that the Democrats now have within their grasp the greatest opportunity of years . And as one of its leaders said to me : " It is pretty nearly our last chance . If we fail now , we shall go the way of the old Whigs . " In order to arrive at the facts regarding the present state of the Democratic party I have visited several of the so-called " ( Aubtful states " of the Union , where , if anywhere , the Democrats must look for success . In most of the other great states of the North the struggle is within the ranks of the Republican party , Insurgent against Regular ; and in the " Solid South " it is within the Democratic party . But in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree in Illinois , Missouri and Kentucky , the conflict for years has been directly between the two old parties . A study of them , therefore , with a brief view of the national situation as it appears from Washington , should give us a clear idea of the present political drift . What is a political party , anyway ? Burke has given the best definition of its primary purpcse : " Party is a body of men united for promoting by their joint endeavors the national interest upon some particular principle in which they are all agreed . " Burke here makes no reference to the promotion of men as one of the purposes of a party . He evidently regards it as too unimportant even to be included within his definition . No clear issue , with him , no party . In New York State , as elsewhere , real parties have disappeared . That is , a " particular principle " which is the reason for parties , no longer unites bodies of men ; the spirit of life has departed . But the mechanism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of past enthusiasms ; they still perform , though haltingly and with suspicious jangling of the interior machinery , the secondary purpose of parties -- that of electing men to office . When the spirit departs , leaders of original ability and boldness of character , impatient above everything of unreality , depart with it ; and the poor old remnants fall into the hands of the rags-and-oldiron men of politics , who get what they can for themselves and their friends out of the wrecks . When the people , discovering the true condition of their political organizations , begin to revolt , what do they do first ? They turn to the strong man , the hero . They elect to office a sort of modern man on horseback . By hook or by crook they seek to  | avoid the toil of thinking for themselves ; they want authority . So the people in New York turned to Hughes , who is peculiarly the hero of slack currents and cross tides . His very insularity of temperament commends him to a people disgusted with too great subserviency to party names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and traditional justice holds steady the ship of state while the pilots are setting a new course . In such a time of confusion and readjustment as the present , Hughes has been an admirable leader . But the people soon find out that one hero , no matter how strong and wise he may be , is not enough . It is the penalty of a people 's government that , the people must govern . They themselves must think out principles , divide in real parties and progress , as ever , with toil and struggle . As I apprehend it , this is the stage of development at which the people of New York are now arriving . They feel that they must reorganize the parties and work out the new " particular principle " upon which they can divide . Once started , they will make a clean sweep of it . " Tim " Woodruff , William Barnes and all their like among the Republicans , and " Fingy " Conners among the Democrats , must go the way of all second-rate men . Politics is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than business ; it again offers a firstclass problem for first-class brains . And this is a great omen ! Democratic Insurgency in New York At Auburn , in the State of New York , lives Thomas M. Osborne . He was born rich ? he came of the Osborne family which made millions in the manufacture of farm machinery . His sister is the wife of James J. Storrow , who - recently ran for Mayor of Boston . Osborne and Storrow are men of much the same type . Both were educated at Harvard . Both combine in large measure the capacity for large affairs with a taste for the finer things of life . They are representatives , indeed , of a new type in American life ? a type somewhat resembling the English man of affairs , who goes into politics from the highest motives ; and yet a type with notable and interesting differences , which some novelist , eager for a new theme , will some day seize upon . To this type belong such men as Gifford Pinchot , James R. Garfield , William Kent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spreckles , Everett Colby , Winston Churchill , Robert Bass , and many others ? rich men , educated : men , who see in public life the highest opportunities for patriotic citizenship . Like thousands of the ablest Democrats of the country ( and Republicans , too ) Osborne has drifted for many years in the slack tides of political activity . He has done what he could in his own city . He has been Mayor of Auburn , he has been deeply interested as a trustee in that significant experiment in democracy , the George Junior Republic , and he was and is a sincere admirer of Governor Hughes . Hughes means real things to him , as he does to thousands of the thoughtful Democrats throughout the state . When the Public Service Commission was organized , Osborne , though a Democrat , was appointed by Governor Hughes as one of its members at a salary of $15,000 a year . From that lucrative office of great honor and service in the state Osborne has recently resigned . He resigned solely that he might devote his whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party . " This is a conception of politics , " comments the New York World , " that by the ordinary party hack will be taken as a sign of eccentricity . If more Democrats of Mr. Osborne 's standing and character had adopted it the Democratic party in New York would not have sunk to its present low estate . " Osborne thought the time had come for real party divisions on real principles in New York State . " I believe that what the Democratic party needs is to take an affirmative stand on something . I want a party that I can live for . I want something I can vote for . I want a chance to vote for men whom I can support heartily . There is a widespread disgust with the Republican organization , and a widespread distrust of the Democratic organization . There is an independent spirit abroad in the land . If we act with any sense at all we shall be able to elect a Democr itic ticket this fall , and if we do that it means that we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this basis Osborne and the group of men whom he has drawn into the work with him entered the politics of New York . " Fingy " Conners , State Boss The party had , indeed , sunk to low estate . It was dominated by two elements , both bad ? the New York City group led by Tammany Hall and the up-state group directed by a crude , raw , forceful character in the person of the state chairman , William J. Conners . " Fingy " Conners began thirty years ago as a " walloper " on the docks of Buffalo , at a time  | when , as Will Irwin says , they were " as Hibernian as a potato . " In those days he was a thick-set , strong young fellow , " with an accent that shook his cheeks and a coarse , goodhumored face . " By virtue of real qualities of rough leadership he rose through the stage of saloon keeper and small political boss to be the master dockman of Buffalo , employing thousands of men . He was a Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is , it mattered little w h a t banner he fought under so long as the fighting was good . He bought other saloons , he bought a newspaper , he bought a fine house in the suburbs and had his name spelled out in white stones on the lawn , he bought another newspaper , he became the greatest employer of labor on the lakes , and finally he became the dominant leader of the New York State Democracy . And all the way up he has fought his political battles just as he fought the battles of the clocks and the saloons , seizing the nearest bung-starter and hitting the first head that showed itself . A fight always straight ahead , gory , irresistible : Conners is the extreme expression of a type of boss very familiar in recent years in American politics . The Democratic party has been , and still is , especially blessed ( or plagued ) with it . Tweed and Croker were the prototypes , and in large measure to-day the Democratic organization in the North is dominated by just such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall , who is superior to Conners in possessing the genius of silence ; Colonel Guffy of Pittsburgh , who is wealthy enough in his own right to constitute the Democratic party of Pennsylvania ; the calculating Harvey Garber , head of the party in Ohio ; Roger Sullivan , that rampant Irishman who controls in Illinois ; " Tom " Taggart of Indiana , and " Gum-Shoe Bill " Stone of Missouri . Most of the men of this type are rich , and not one of them has the most distant approach to a political principle . They are organization men pure and simple , engaging in politics to fill offices , and to make money out of them . In New York , under the convention system , Murphy and Conners have for . ears controlled the affairs of the Democratic party in the most autocratic and violent manner . In 1906 they allowed Hearst to seize upon the Buffalo convention , and nominated Hearst for Governor . The Struggle to Defeat Conners It was here that Osborne first appeared prominently in New York politics . Disgusted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he called a conference of leading Democrats of the state to protest . District Attorney Jerome , Edward M. Shepard of Brooklyn , J. N. Carlisle of Watertown , and other men of equal prominence were present . In these words , which have in them the ring of a fighting patriotism , Osborne characterized the situation : " We have seen caucuses snapped , as in Broome , Chautauqua , Cortland , and other counties ; proxies forged , as in Orleans and Essex Counties ; conventions purchased , as in Wayne County ; delegates openly bribed for riot and disorder , as in  | Jefferson County ; an attempt to deceive a whole community by a muzzled press , as in Erie County ; newspapers blackmailed as in Monroe and Onondaga Counties ? and who can estimate the amount of lying , blackmail , bribery and corrupt promises necessary to make such a kind of a campaign even partially successful ? We have already suffered enough from the efforts of business interests to purchase control of our party for business purposes ; shall we submit now to the efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for personal purposes ? " Well , Hearst was defeated , largely by this vigorous opposition within the Democratic party itself . But practical politics as represented by Conners was still far from yielding to the idea of politics for principles as represented by Osborne , Shepard , Jerome ; Rice and Bissell . The 1908 convention in Carnegie Hall was conducted with an even more desperate autocracy of violence . Conners worked hand in hand with Tammany Hall . Whole delegations were thrown out and the Murphy-Conners program was driven through with remorseless force . No right of free speech or free action was acknowledged . The really able and thoughtful men of the party were wholly eliminated ; and as was quite to be expected , the Democrats lost the fall elections , Hughes being returned to office by 70,000 plurality over Chanler . The next step in the struggle was taken in June of last year ( 1909 ) . Osborne called together another conference at Albany . It was decided to hold a great meeting of independent Democrats from every part of the state . The response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prevailing party control . On September ninth and tenth about 600 delegates came together at Saratoga . Unlike the Insurgent conference of 1892 , preceding the election of Cleveland , of which the entire expenses were paid by Whitney , these delegates came on their own motion and paid their own way . No members of the old Democratic organization were present . Men from both wings of the party were in attendance , but the Gold Democrats far outnumbered the Bryanites . Speeches were made by judge Alton B. Parker , Thomas M. Osborne , Edward M. Shepard , Judge Herrick , Augustus Van Wyck , Mayor Sague of Poughkeepsie and others . " We meet here with a common purpose , " said Osborne , " to do all we can toward making the New York Democracy once more powerful . respected , and successful ; powerful if its basic principles be duly formulated into policies , respected and successful if organized under men respected and worthy of respect . " " I declare my conviction , " said Edward M. Shepard , " that it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our politics are now suffering . " Democratic League Formed The conference resulted in the formation of a Democratic League with Osborne as Chairman ; and that League is now organizing in every part of the state . A general campaign of education upon Democratic principles is being conducted . And just recently ( February 24th ) the influence of the new element , backed by Tammany ( Murphy having fallen out with Conners ) , has forced Conners to promise to retire . But the new leaders have much to contend with . Theirs is the problem of any group of men who seek to reorganize either of the old parties ; for they must work more or less closely with the old discredited machines which have fastened upon the party names . While Tammany has no political principles whatever , it yet stands for Democracy in New York City . And however high the motives of Osborne and his group , they can not escape the popular suspicion of any movement in which Tammany plays a part . On the other hand , its leaders are cheered onward by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republican organization . Indeed , in spite of Hughes ' election , in spite of Roosevelt 's popularity , there has been a steady drift toward Democratic control for several years . In the elections of 1909 the Democrats gained fourteen mayors of cities , now having twenty-nine mayors out of a total of forty-eight . They also gained five members in the lower house of the legislature . Encouraged by the Saratoga conference and the evident uprising for better things , Democrats in all parts of the state have been getting together as they have not done before in years . In Warren County , up near Lake George , for example , which has gone Republican almost from time immemorial , the Democrats aroused the voters and with comparatively little effort elected a Democratic Assemblyman , Mr. De Long , and swept the entire county ticket , with a single  | exception . From a Republican plurality in the election of 1908 of 1,781 votes Warren County elected a Democrat in 909 by a plurality of 762 votes . Orleans County ( Batavia ) elected a Democratic member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Educational Campaign of the Democrats I saw evidences everywhere of this revival . At Buffalo , for example , I found a lively Young Men 's Democratic Club , the president of which is Francis F. Baker , a lawyer and a Harvard man . They have been significantly endeavoring to educate their members , not in mere organization matters , but in principles and issues . They have had addresses on " Why I Am a Democrat , " by prominent Democrats . They have discussed the policies of Jefferson , Jackson and Cleveland . They have taken up such subjects as the tariff and the policy of centralization in government as against states ' rights . Another influence in New York and throughout the country has been the increasing circulation of a number of Democratic journals such as Bryan 's Commoner , and more recently the National Monthly of Buffalo , which has a circulation of 110,000 . No such journals are maintained by the Republicans , nor have the Republicans made any attempt in New York or elsewhere , so far as I know , toward a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied themselves with trying everywhere to strengthen their organization . For example , the administration at Washington , which is daily growing more alarmed at party conditions in New York , Ohio , Indiana and other doubtful states , has been patching up the old Republican machine in New York . A new man , Mr. Griscom , has come in to head the New York County Committee , but , so far as the idealism of the party is concerned , it is led by Ilughesand he is an Independent . The Democrats have several strong men to put up next fall as candidates for state offices and for Congress . Gaynor , Osborne , Shepard , and Judge Herrick are all talked of for Governor . On the other hand , with Hughes eliminated ( having positively declined to run again ) , the Republicans have no candidate who touches in the least the imagination of the people . Nothing short of the mast extraordinary conditions will prevent a Democratic victory next fall . It is conceivable that if Roosevelt and Hughes , forgetting their old personal differences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly strong candidate , for example Otto T. Bannard , who made a favorable impression as candidate for mayor of New York last fall , they might chance a doubtful victory , but even with this powerful support it would be difficult to offset the strong tide now flowing toward Democratic control . The fatuities of the Taft administration , the Aldrich tariff bill , the Allds-Conger scandal , which seriously involves the Republican members of the legislature , t h e utter disgust with t h e Republican machine , the disgrace of the presence of Depew in the Senate , will be difficult to meet even with the most vigorous Republican tactics . In Ohio , while the situation is similar in its broader aspects to that of New York , the Democrats are in a far better tactical position . In Ohio , as in New York , there is a discredited Democratic machine , having among its pillars some of the most unsavory politicians in the state . There are also many idealistic Democrats , but unlike the conservative New York group led by Osborne and Shepard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men like Torn . Johnson ard New-ton D. Baker of Cleveland and Brand Whitlock of Toledo , and a conservative wing led by Governor Judson Harmon . But the Democrats of Ohio have this advantage over those of New York : they are in control of the state administration . Governor Harmon bears much the same relationship to the Democrats of Ohio that Hughes does to the Republicans of New York . He has been bitterly assailed by Mr. Garber , the leader of the party in Ohio , just as Hughes has been attacked by Woodruff and Barnes in New York . Upon many if not most essential points of conviction and of method , Harmon and Hughes stand upon the same platform , although according to an outworn political nomenclature one must be called a Democrat , the other a Republican . Governor Harmon is of a type very familiar , very easily understood by the present generation of Americans . His history is the history of a legion of successful Americans . Born in a country town , his father a Baptist minister , he was educated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good deal of the color and tang of the common soil . Meeting him for the first time , it seemed to me I had always known him , or men just like him ? just such familiar MiddleWesterners . A bluff , ruddy man ? he is sixtyfour ? partly bald , with crisp , iron-gray hair close-clipped around his solid head ; a stubbly mustache ; heavy , stiff eyebrows ; a keen , lively , shrewd eye ? such is the picture . He stands as straight as a ramrod . He is over six feet tall and weighs two hundred and ten pounds . He is big-bodied , big-chested , big-handed ? his hands are like those of Grover Cleveland ? and he has a square chin , a healthy , robust presence , and a bluff , good-humored way of talking . He looks for all the world like a weath- ered army colonel , to whom life is still sweet . Nor is it surprising to learn that he is an eager horseback rider and a first-class marksman with a rifle . He gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life . And , indeed , he is . His family has grown up and married , he has laid away enough money to keep him in comfort to the end of his days , and , with Mrs. Harmon encouraging him , he has entered upon public life with the peculiar zest of excellent health , a stout heart and high spirits . He likes it , and shows that he likes it . And yet Governor Harmon never sought a public office in his life ; he did not seek the Cincinnati judgeship , nor the seat in Cleveland 's cabinet , nor the governorship . Nor is he now seeking any higher office . He has been an important lawyer in Cincinnati : the sort of a steady , dependable , likable man to whom his contemporaries turn when they have a hard job to be done . Not in any sense a brilliant man ? indeed , he is slow in his mental professes , slow and dogged ? he yet moves along to his results with a sort of irresistible certainty . More than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grover Cleveland . So far as he goes , he is absolutely sure of himself , possessing in high measure the courage of unimaginative honesty . He is very sure of himself on the tariff question , accepting the traditional Democratic doctrine , and he is sure from long training that the law , whatever it is , should be minutely enforced . When he was Attorney-General in Cleveland 's cabinet , for example , he took the law literally as he found it and won the first great case for the government under the Sherman anti-trust act ? the so-called " Trans-Missouri " case ? and he began the " Joint Traffic Association " and the Addystone Pipe cases , both very famous decisions in our law . And it will be recalled that when Roosevelt selected Mr. Harmon and Mr. Judson , as men of the highest public honor and disinterested patriotism , to investigate the Santa Fe rebate cases , Mr. Harmon , discovering that the Santa Fe was really guilty of rebating , wanted to go straight forward in his literally minded , solidly honest way with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though one of them , Paul Morton , sat in Roosevelt 's cabinet . And he would have done it , too , if Mr. Roosevelt had let him go ahead . Upon this case he laid down a fundamental policy in his creed , the creed of the instinctive individualist : " Guilt is always personal . So long as officials can hide behind their corporations no remedy can be effective . When the government searches out the guilty man and makes corporate wrongdoing mean personal punishment and dishonor , the laws will be obeyed . " Strength and Weakness of Governor Harmon His mind , which is without subtlety , never goes a single step ahead of the immediate prob . lem : his politics are all of the out-of-doors sort , perfectly clear and open . He strides straight down the middle of the road , doing his immediate duty as he sees it , not caring too much what people think . Such a type of man , utterly to be respected , is  | excellently adapted to administrative statesmanship . His conduct of his office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval . With a high sense of good order and the force of law , he has dealt with the business problems of taxation , he has cleaned up the state treasury , started suits against former treasurers for interest on state funds , cleaned up the state printing office , and grappled with the management of state institutions , succeeding everywhere exactly as he succeeded when he was receiver for the ruined Pere Marquette and Cincinnati , Hamilton &; Dayton Railroad system , which he recently turned over to its owners , all shiny with fresh respectability , every creditor fully paid . But he has shown , thus far , no genius of the sort so necessary in a time of vast economic and political readjustment , when new principles are to be laid down and new roads blazed in the wilderness and boldly followed . In short , one would scarcely expect of Governor Harmon any large capacity for constructive statesmanship : for he is without political imagination . One has strongly the impression , after talking with him , that when crowded , he would invariably land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mind has no refuge but the traditional . This would , indeed , be the natural course of a man of Harmon 's age and experience , combined with long years of legal training , and an environment of courts and settled business conditions . And while one comes away from a meeting with Governor Harmon with thoroughgoing liking for the man , with high respect for his unusual qualities , one is conscious , also , that he has fired no waiting train of the imagination . More and more such men should and will be attracted into just such great public administrative offices as that of state governor . For our state governments are inevitably going the way of city governments ? out of national politics . There is no earthly reason to-day why the governor of a state should he either a Republican or a Democrat . The chief problems of the states have little to do with the great issues of the national parties ? with the tariff , with the currency , with foreign commerce and foreign relationships , with the greater problems of railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is scarcely a recognizable Republican or Democratic doctrine in the businesslike platform of either Hughes or Harmon , who are to-day perhaps the most successful state administrators in the country . On the other hand , the chief concerns of the states , such as education , the support of penal institutions and asylums , local taxation and the liquor problem , have little or nothing to do with the national party issues . But there are still vast national questions to be decided by partisan action ; and the fact that a man makes an admirable state administrator , or an admirable mayor of a great city , does not necessarily imply that he will make a constructive leader of a great national party . I have considered Governor Harmon so much at length because he is one of the men now most considered as a Democratic leader in 1912 . That his hold on the people of Ohio is strong , and growing stronger , needs no better evidence than the terror which he inspires in the hearts of the Republican leaders . Ohio is Mr. Taft 's state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can not well be handicapped at the outstart by the loss of his own state and by the appearance there of a powerful presidential candidate of the opposite party . Therefore Mr. Taft has had repeated conferences of the Ohio Republican politicians at the White House , and the old leaders have been superseded by Wade Ellis , a shrewd lawyer who has been one of Mr. Taft 's trust prosecutors . This attempted domination from the top , rather than democratic methods within the organization , has made many Ohio Republicans uncomfortable . It smacks too much of the Hanna method of directorship ? which no one in Ohio but Hanna has ever had the genius to operate with success . In short , the political tide in Ohio , as in New York , is undoubtedly setting strongly toward the Democratic party . Mr. Harmon will run again for Governor this fall , and he will undoubtedly receive the votes of a very large number of progressive Republicans as well as the undivided Democratic party vote . National Situation of the Two Old Parties Having thus considered somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing the decided drift toward the Democratic party , it will be profitable to glance for a moment at the national situation . A more cheering combination of circumstances from the Democratic point of view could not have been devised by the greatest politician of them all . Their pathway is truly made smooth of the iniquities of their enemies . Not only in the Middle West . but in several important Eastern states , as I have shown in former articles , the Republicans are facing a widespread and determined factional revolt of the Insurgents and Progressives within their own party . The **29;303;TOOLONG  | Garfield wing of the party is unalterably opposed to the **26;334;TOOLONG wing . At Washington a vibratory administration , already fighting on the defensive , is staggering under a heavy load of unpopular cabinet secretaries ? Hitchcock , Ballinger and Knox . Seeking with weak amiability and dull sincerity for party harmony upon questions of principle which admit of no compromise , it has entangled itself with leaders in Congress who have utterly lost the confidence of the rank and file even of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a notoriously unpopular tariff bill passed in defiance of the preelection promises of the party leaders . It has shaken the people 's confidence by an attitude of complaisant legalism upon the approved policy of conservation , by giving comfort to the enemies of that policy ? men like Ballinger ? and by alienating such supporters of it as Pinchot and Garfield , whom the people trust . And while it has failed to retain the support of the great agricultural population of the West , neither has it secured the unalloyed approval of the powerful monied interests of the East . The general economic condition of the country has also contributed to augment the difficulties of the Republican party . An amazing increase in the cost of living ; the continued formation of enormous trusts and monopolies , which , easily resisting the assaults of the law , continue to cut the juiciest of melons ; the prevalence of bitter strikes and boycotts , and a feverish condition of the money-market , have served to inflame the spirit of unrest which , rightly or wrongly , turns accusingly upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic ? All these conditions have served to enhearten the Democratic leaders . In the present House of Representatives there are one hundred and seventy-three Democrats and two hundred and nineteen Republicans , although of these Republicans from twenty to thirty-five are Insurgents who will sometimes vote with the Democrats , as shown by the conflict in March over the Cannon rules . A change of twentyfive Congressmen at the coming fall elections from the Republican to the Democratic side , will make the I louse Democratic even without any help from the Insurgents . And the Democrats have laid out their plan of campaign with a hope of success that they have not indulged before in years . Such a result as the by election in the Fourteenth Massachusetts District on March 22 , in which a Republican stronghold with a Republican plurality of 14,000 in 1908 was changed to a Democratic plurality of 5,000 , electing Mr. Eugene N. Foss to Congress , furnishes the strongest evidence of the change in public sentiment . If they win the House of Representatives , as seems now more than probable , Champ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will undoubtedly be elected to the speakership to succeed " Uncle Joe " Cannon . In that event , or indeed , in any event , Mr. Clark will be one of the leading candidates for the Democratic nomination for the Presidency in 1912 . Champ Clark of Missouri Mr. Clark is one of the most experienced men in the House . Born in Kentucky , edu-  | cated at the University of Kentucky and at the Cincinnati Law School , he was at one time the president of a small college in West Virginia , at one time the editor of a newspaper , and for years a practicing lawyer . He once worked as a hired man on a farm and later as a clerk in a country store . A man of commanding presence , a read- , forceful and often witty speaker , he has been steadily gathering strength and leadership in his party . His generalship during the fight on the Cannon rules was admirable . Like several of the Republican progressives he has appeared much on the lecture platform . In no sense an original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hammering away at familiar party slogans . He makes a strong point of party regularity , and his look for solutions is always backward . He would use Jefferson 's first inaugural as a part of the platform of the Democratic party . He was one of the heartiest supporters of Mr. Bryan in all of his campaigns , and as contrasted with leaders like Harmon and Shepard he would belong to the radical wing of the party . If I were to characterize him , I should say that he was a traditional radical rather than a constructive radical . Like many Missourians , he has the personal democratic manners and ways of the Westerner with the political point of view of the Southerner . He is sixty years old . Democratic Presidential Candidates So far as the ken of man can now discern , the leading candidates on the Democratic ticket in 1912 will he Harmon of Ohio , if he is reelected as Governor ; the Governor of New York , if a Democrat is elected , who may be Gaynor , Shepard , Osborne , or Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , no doubt , be a number of " favorite sons " advanced , Governor Marshall of Indiana , Senator Gore of Oklahoma , and others . It is not likely that Bryan will appear as a factor . Not only has he himself declared that he is not a candidate , but nowhere in any of the ten states which I have recently visited have I heard a single Democratic leader express a desire that Bryan should run again , or a hope that he could be elected if he did run . The Dominating Fact in American Politics I have endeavored thus to set forth the present political situation in its broadest aspects ; but I have not vet developed what is undoubtedly the central and dominating fact in American politics at this moment . I refer to the growth and power of the Independent vote . Everywhere I went in my recent investigations I found political leaders trying to devise ways of attracting this Independent vote . In New York they said : " If we win , we 've got to put up a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohio the same problem confronts them . Not before in years , if ever , in this country , has there been such a proportion of the voters who hold themselves aloof from both parties and vote as they think . It should certainly be food for thought when we reflect that states like Ohio , Indiana and Minnesota should vote for a Republican president and Democratic governors ; when a city like New York should choose a Democratic mayor and an Independent supporting ticket ; when Oregon should compel a Republican legislature to choose a Democratic United States Senator ; when whole states should pick and choose between regular Republicans and Insurgents .  | Never before was there such a sensitive public opinion . Never before were there so many independent organs of publicity , such as the magazines , and a growing independent newspaper press , of which the so-called Scripps papers are the most notable examples . One of the veteran correspondents in Ohio told me that in all of his experience he never knew a time when newspapers of all shades of political belief were so willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a very real sense this country to-day is being governed by a thinking vote . A group in the South still votes upon national questions with undisturbed subserviency to a party name ; a similar unthinking group votes the Republican ticket in the North . These two groups counterbalance one another , like the paired voters in a legislature ? and the thinking Independents settle the issues . The new direct primary laws and more stringent election laws have given enormously added effectiveness to these Independents . What Do the Independents Want ? It becomes , then , with each party organization , chiefly a problem as to what the Independents want . Politics is merely the judgment of astute men as to what the people have made up their minds to do . For parties never make issues : issues make parties . A demagogue may guess what the people want and make personal capital out of his shrewdness ; but a statesman not only knows what the people want , but he shows them definitely , clearly , and honestly how they can get it . Sometimes he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought , but upon methods proposed . It becomes a question , then , what the thinking people in this country really want , and it is evidently the judgment of the most astute leaders of both parties that the people are to-day decidedly progressive . The great majority of Americans , although prosperous , cool-hearted and calm-minded , have undoubtedly made up their minds that present conditions are wrong morally wrong ? and must be changed . They have it very clearly in mind that monopolistic wealth , instead of controlling the government , as it does now , must be controlled . They believe , with Edmund Barke , that " if we command our wealth , we shall be rich and free . If our wealth command us , we are poor indeed . " Now the politician has readily leaped to this conclusion : he sees that there is no better platform than anti-monopoly and anti-specialprivilege . Both parties want to be thought progressive . It is indeed almost pathetic ? the @#  | desire of the Democrats that the Republicans should remain conservative and allow them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , not a few Republican politicians , all those really responsive to the public will , are out-progressing the Democrats . They , too , are racing for the Independent vote . The worst thing that the Democrats had against Roosevelt was not that they did not approve of most of his policies , but that , being a farsighted politician , he saw where the people were going and forced his party to make its issues accordingly . But a prosperous and enlightened people like ours , if they are radical in their conclusions , are instinctively conservative in their methods of arriving at those conclusions . They do not want a revolution : but they do want progress . So they say to the politicians : " How are you going to reach the things we want ? What do you propose ? " So the parties come forward with their platforms and the people decide whether the remedies suggested will really reach the seat of the difficulty . In 1896 Mr. Bryan , in his free silver issue , advised a tonic rather than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was rejected . Platforms of the Various Parties Only one party now in evidence in American politics has any really comprehensive policy to offer . Whatever may be our hostility to its tenets. the fact remains that the Socialist party is the only one that makes any pretense to having reasoned out our present conditions to an ultimate conclusion . It is the only one that has a literature and a clearly defined doctrine : it possesses the strength of a positive faith . The Socialists say that in order to reach the abuses under which the people groan , the fundamental problem of the control and distribution of wealth must be frankly and boldly met . And they propose definite and sweeping changes in the very basis of industry : they say that industry must be shifted from a competitive to a cooperative foundation , and they declare that society must not only regulate the railroads and other monopolies but must take steps toward ultimate public ownership . But the Republican and Democratic parties in their platforms only propose what they believe to be necessary next steps to cure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus far held the great mass of the people makes it politically evident that the people are not yet prepared for any comprehensive doctrine such as the Socialists propose . In this connection it is worthy of note that the tendency of the Democratic party is now decidedly away from a more comprehensive toward a less comprehensive platform . As I have talked with the leaders I have discovered a growing conviction among them that the issues should be narrowed down ? be made more conservative . " We have failed by the strength , rather than the weakness , of our platforms , " Governor Marshall of Indiana said to me . The tendency , then , is to narrow down the issues to one or two very definite things . Most of the leaders with whom I have talked thought that the tariff should be the chief issue discussed in the coming campaigns . " Whenever we could narrow the issue down to the tariff , " a leading Democrat said to me , " we have always won . " John Sharp Williams on Democratic Issues John Sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the House , thus writes me his vigorous opinion as to what issue the party should stand for . " Drive and drive home always , until victory is won over enemies without and traitors within , the policies of tariff reduction , and the strict and pitiless execution of the anti-trust and interstate commerce laws . Drive home until it shall become a public realization , the fact  | that Protectionism is unjust in its operation , socialistic in its tendency , and , above all , corrupting to politics and to business . " Governor Harmon and Champ Clark would stand exactly upon this platform of a lower tariff and law-enforcement . But several difficulties are here discernible . One of these is the fact that the Insurgent Republicans , who may yet secure control of the party , also stand upon the platform of tariff reduction and law enforcement . LaFollette , Beveridge , Cummins , Clapp , Dolliver , Murdock , Lenroot , Madison , Poindexter and others voted against the Aldrich-Payne tariff bill with quite as much enthusiasm as any Democrat . Another and worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now low-tariff men . Only five Democratic Senators in the fight last year on the tariff bill were really consistent low-tariff men . Only four , Gore of Oklahoma , Rayner of Maryland , Smith of South Carolina , and Shively of Indiana , voted against every increase and for every decrease in the tariff . And some Democratic Senators , like McEnery of Louisiana , were rather consistent high protectionists . In short , nothing better shows the need of a realignment of parties upon issues which really separate them ? which the proposed issues certainly do not ? or the organization of a new party . The Democratic party may , and probably will , win at the coming Congressional elections ; but if it does , it will not do it by virtue of strong affirmative or progressive issues : it will be a negative victory , the result of a revolt from organization Republicanism . In Michigan , where I live , a strong revolt from Republican machine rule is evident , and a strong disapproval of stand-pat members in Congress ; but if the state goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the affirmative virtues of the Democrats , but because of the iniquities of the Republicans , and because many voters believe that better government would result in the state if the opposition party were more robust . It is thus difficult , in spite of the evident desire of the Democrats for a strong affirmative issue , to avoid the conclusion that the party is still seeking negative victories , is still trying to profit by revolt . Most of its issues are expressed in negative terms : anti-tariff , anti-centralization , anti-shipsubsidy , anti-imperialism , anti-monopoly . The Break-up of the Solid South But one great end would probably be served by a sweeping Democratic victory in the corn- ing campaigns : and that is the break-up of the " Solid South . " Only a Democratic victory will do that . For the Southern Democracy is still held together by a dead hand . Place upon its leaders once more the necessity and responsibility of dealing with live issues , and they will immediately divide into hostile camps of conservatives and radicals upon economic issues , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that end is accomplished , we may look for a new alignment in this country between a genuine conservative party and a genuine liberal party ? when patriotic conservatives in the Democratic party may get together with patriotic conservatives in the Republican party , and when patriotic progressives in the Republican party may get together with patriotic progressives in the Democratic party . And the " particular principle " upon which these parties will divide , if it is to thrill the imagination and engage the passionate loyalty of all the people , must be fundamental . It must deal frankly and honestly with the control and distribution of wealth . Is the control of the country 's wealth to be left in the hands of private monopolists who are truly modern kings , or is it to be controlled by the people ? Beneath the tariff question , beneath the agitation over the cost of living , beneath ship-  | subsidies and postal savings banks , lies this monumental problem which can not much longer be escaped . No issue in this country ever grew to prominence with such swiftness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Because it possesses the enlivening breath of reality : it is a plan for stopping the raids of private monopolies . It is nothing more nor less than the demand of the people that the nation shall itself control our natural resources . A similar significance marks the almost irresistible turning of the people , regardless of party , toward the national government , and the demand that the government ? not private monopoly ? shall take hold of the vast irrigation projects , improve the natural waterways , extend the already mighty business of the post-office , on the one hand , in the direction of banking ( the postal savings bank ) , and , on the other , toward the absorption , through the parcels-post , of much of the express business of the country . Right or wrong , these are the tendencies . The federal income tax is another instance ; so is Mr. Taft 's federal incorporation scheme , which was , indeed , first advocated by a Democrat , Senator Newlands of Nevada ; so is the peculiar unanimity of approval with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canal . If I succeed in nothing else in this article , I may perhaps succeed in conveying some idea of the utter political confusion which now exists in this country . Many Democrats belong with the Republicans and many Republicans with the Democrats , and the trail of the Independent serpent is over them all . There is a great buzzing of activity , but no one seems to be going anywhere . The parties would like to fight , but they are all so mixed up that they can not be sure of not killing more of their own followers than of the enemy . Never was there such a need of clear-think- ing statesmanship , never was there such a call for patriotic courage of conviction . One of the most interesting conversations which I have had recently was with President Woodrow Wilson of Princeton University . Be is a Democrat both by tradition , being from North Carolina , and from conviction . But his chief emphasis is upon just this need of clear thinking upon national questions . He condemns backward looking ; he is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no means a nationalist . He believes that the leader should be able to answer the questions of the people not with vague generalities , but with definite propositions well thought out . He makes one extraordinarily interesting proposal : that men who have these great questions close to their hearts shall correspond with one another as did the leaders in the days of the American revolution . A man who publishes his convictions is thereby committed to them , but by discussion and correspondence he may arrive at sounder conclusions . But whatever can be said of the prevailing political confusion , it represents at least the activity of real life , real thought . There is no stagnancy nor indifference , and that is a great omen . Men of the highest ability and probity are coming into politics everywhere . Young men are organizing and fundamental principles are being discussed as they have not been before in years . Sincere and patriotic men in politics , whatever their opinions may be , whether Democrats . Republicans , or Socialists , ? whether Conservatives or Radicals ? are good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics are , first , those who are selfishly indifferent ; and , second , those who prostitute political influence to private gain . And the indifferent are more to be dreaded than those who are actively predatory , for the evil politician soon defeats himself , while the indifferent one rests upon society like a dead weight .
