Today 's debate was on various subjects , including the food question , brewing ? and diplomacy . All hostile amendments against the Premier 's address were withdrawn or rejected . John , Nationalist , read an amendment to the Premier 's address , regretting that no reasoned reply was sent to the Pope 's peace note , and suggesting that this was due to a secret treaty with Italy recently published in Petrograd , which Mr. asserted was calculated to demoralize Catholic soldiers , because it excluded representatives of the Holy See from the peace conference .
