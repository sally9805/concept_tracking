TO the practical man , it seems a far cry from philosophy to life , or vice versa . Nor is he without grounds for his indifferent attitude toward abstract speculation . For like art , philosophy has claimed a right to exist " for its own sake , " and this right it has exercised so freely that too often , in the past , it has been what William James once called it : " a mere reiteration of what dusty-minded professors have written about what other previous professors have thought . " But here as elsewhere there has been a change . The dust is clearing from the minds of the professors . Philosophy is once more seen as a handmaid of life . And this restoration of an all but severed connection between the world of facts and the world of thought has , in turn , brought our practical man to see that he himself has , and needs , a sort of philosophy of his own : some kind of plan or scheme in the back of his head , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which , consciously or unconsciously , he bases his daily conduct . Foremost of those who have helped to produce this new understanding of philosophy as , essentially , a basis for action , must be mentioned the late William James . But speaking at Manchester College , Oxford , not long before his death , this " unchallenged veteran leader of American psychology and philosophy " said : " Without the confidence which being able to lean on Bergson 's authority gives me , I should never have ventured to urge these particular views of mine upon this ultra-critical audience . " The word of any one man , even though he be a James , does not make or maintain a world-reputation . But the same enthusiasm for the greatest living French thinker has been evinced by other men , hardly less capable of giving judgment . To-day the sworn adherents of what is already beginning to call itself Bergsonism are legion , spread all over the civilized world , attracting new recruits daily , and taking their strength from the  | very flower of intelligent , progressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves under the leadership of Bergson with such fervency that those in power have come to fear a general desertion from all the accepted ideals and idols of orthodox , materialistic science . At Jena and Oxford , at Rome and Stockholm , the professors no less than the students are touched by the same sense of a new dispensation . Such diverging , if not actually opposed , movements as Anarchistic Syndicalism and Catholic Modernism proclaim in this quiet , keen-eyed Parisian professor their chosen and inspired prophet . Here in America , three of his principal works have been brought out at once by two different publishers . Such a figure , with all the marks of leadership upon him , must surely fall within the class indicated by Bernard Shaw when he wrote that , " the most pitiful sort of ignorance is ignorance of the few great men who are men of our own time . " Henri Bergson is still a young man , born in 1859 at Paris . In him the cosmopolitan character of modern thought finds a striking symbol , for while we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family that probably lived in Poland once , his parents came to France from Ireland . And though it is dan gerous to ascribe an exaggerated importance to the influence of " time and race and place , " one can not help detecting in him traces both of Celtic mysticism and of Jewish love for clear-cut dialectic distinctions . He himself has risen above race and creed and nationality toward that universalism of spirit which seems to be the common goal of all civilized mankind nowadays . He was educated in the public schools of France , obtaining his naturalization as a French citizen only after he had entered them . At first mathematics cast a spell on him , and while still a boy of eighteen , he won a prize by an essay deemed good enough for publication in a prominent mathematical journal . Through the reading of Herbert Spencer he was drawn from that first love and moved to enter the Ecole Normale , but even after he had become a student of philosophy he had no thought of giving his life to it . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanics and found that time was not allowed to play any part at all in this science , did his common  | sense revolt , causing him to turn his attention to the problem of consciousness itself . And to-day his entire philosophical sys tem stands based on time , or duration , as the chief reality known and knowable to man . Graduating in 1881 , he taught in various high schools and colleges until , in 1900 , he was given the chair of modern philos ophy in the ancient College de France , a Parisian university dating back to the sixteenth century . In 1889 he won his doc tor 's degree by a thesis that did much toward the founding of his reputation as a highly original and daring thinker . And in 1901 he was elected to the Institute as a member of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences . Such are the few landmarks of a career which James described as " commonplace to the ut most , so far as outward facts go . " Professor Bergson 's adventures have all taken place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination and his utter fearlessness of consequences have led him on to one startling encounter after another . He is not a prolific writer , being mainly eager to make each work an adequate expression of the conclusions prompting it . Thus , for instance , one of his briefest works had been twenty years in preparation before at last it appeared in print . So far he has published only four volumes outside of his doctor 's the sis , together with a score of articles and essays . The books of his that have just been brought out here in English translation are : Time and Free Will ( Macmillan ) ; Matter and Memory ( Macmillan ) ; Creative Evolution ( Holt &; Company ) . The last mentioned is his main work , . embodying all the ideas that tend to set his philosophy apart from the systems it threatens to supersede . In their original versions , all his books , including the one not yet translated , Laughter , have reached six or more editions . And one or the other of them has already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a full understanding of his influence , within his own country and be yond it , we must always bear in mind that , as one of his Ger man admirers has expressed it , " he is a personality , not merely the head of a school . " The magnetic quality that emanates both from his person and from his writings , making " old-fashioned professors , whom  | his ideas quite fail to satisfy , nevertheless speak of his talent almost with bated breath , " stands in intimate relation to the fundamental conceptions of his philosophy . And it seems quite natural that a man who has turned from the intellect to intui tion for a solution of life 's riddles should have a style as flexible and as picturesque as that of any poet . In fact , Bergson is a poet , no less than a thinker , and to find proof of it one might turn at random to any one of his pages . Thus only a poet could describe the past as " pressing against the portals of consciousness that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is that tells us of our memories that " these messengers from the unconscious remind , us of what we are dragging behind us unawares " - namely , the past . And finally I want to quote , in this connection , the splendid passage by which he explains the basis and purpose of our reason : " Har nessed , like yoked oxen , to a heavy task , we feel the play of our muscles and joints , the weight of the plow and the resistance of the soil . To act and to know that we are acting , to come into touch with reality and even to live it , but only in the measure in which it concerns the work that is being accomplished and the furrow that is being plowed , such is the function of human intelligence . " Form , however , is merely a means to Bergson ? it holds the same relation to his thought as matter to life , rendering it vis ible and tangible . His chief power lies not in the charm exerted by his words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he makes us feel how life and its various processes are growing more and more intelligible . It is as a philosopher in the highest sense of that term , as an interpreter of life who enables us to live more effectively , that he wins a lasting hold on our attention . Like all innovators , he stands to a large extent alone . His world-con ception is not to be easily disposed of " by reference to some fa miliar ism . " Of course , he continues the best thought of the past , but to us as well as to the future his departures from it are of more significance than his debt to it . The older philosophers made reason king . To them it was synonymous with consciousness . It offered the only acknowl edged road to knowledge , and knowledge gained by any other  | route was not worth having . This master instrument , which they identified with the soul itself , they used principally to prove the unreality of whatever seemed palpably real to ordinary men . Out of the vast surrounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ourselves mere dupes at the mercy of our senses and that very reason which they had enthroned so high above the spectral flow of time and space . To those thinkers of a bygone day only the type was real , not its unique individual embodiment , and the most real thing of all was a pale absolute created out of the stagnant air of their own studies . The revolt against this rationalistic , idealistic philosophy , with its equal contempt for facts and feelings , had begun before Bergson was born , but it was left for him to carry it on to a tri umphant climax . Continuing the work so gloriously started by Schopenhauer , Comte , Mill and Spencer , he has taken liberally from , and as liberally given to , men like James and Dewey , Bou troux and Tarde , Wundt and Ostwald . But as he has outstripped the Utilitarianism and the Positivism of the past , so he has also gone beyond parallel forms of modern practicalism . While placing himself firmly on the new ground won from the enclosing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear to those vague but insistent voices within that so often have lured man 's soul from sober , uninspired thinking into utopian or apocalyptic dreaming . But unlike so many other listeners to the siren song of intuition , he has kept his mind from losing itself in the fogs of purely emotional mysticism . And thus he has reached both the courage and the insight needed to create a new metaphysics , capable of satisfying our own century 's demand for actuality even in its dreams of the unknowable . The very corner-stone of Bergson 's system must be sought in his definition of intellect as " an appendage to the faculty of acting . " We think in terms of action and for the sake of acting . Pure speculation , like " art for art 's sake , " is a mere luxury , while action is a necessity . And we see and conceive the sur rounding world as an object for our action . But in its constant outgoing toward the matter that fills this world , our intellect has been lured on to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could never hope to solve unaided .  | Here we should be left helpless but for the continued pres ence within us of that lower , but complementary , form of con sciousness ? instinct ? which guides the animal world below man . Instinct deals with properties , and not with things ; with life in its protean fluidity , and not with the congealed forms of matter . This kind of consciousness is almost silenced within us , but it glimmers through our feelings , in our sudden sympathies and antipathies , wherever a vital interest of ours becomes involved . Our whole subconscious existence leaps unexpectedly into clear light when Bergson thus contrasts it with our self-conscious rea soning : " We think with only a small part of the past , but it is with our entire past , including the original bent of our soul , that we desire , will and act . " Instinct , as Bergson views it , has access to the inner truths of life , but would never seek them and could never formulate them if left to itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon itself , so to speak ; it becomes disinterested and selfconscious ; it rises to intuition , which transcends intellect , while having to thank intellect for its rise . By trusting ourselves to intuition , we are rendered capable of plunging into that evermoving , ever-changing stream of duration which is life itself . Therefore , a world-conception built up by the intellect alone must necessarily be mechanical , impressing us as a mosaic painfully pieced together ; while a philosophy sprung from intuitive knowledge , out of instinct pushed and controlled by intellect ? a philosophy like Bergson 's own ? will affect us like a living , grow ing plant . Looking at the world in this way , and in this new light , Bergson finds not unity but duality : ever opposed and ever combined , life and matter are locked in never-ending struggle . Within all matter the energy that carries it tends to decline toward its low est level ? toward heat and the absolute zero . Life , on the other hand , strives everlastingly to raise energy to higher and higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspend its descent . From the antagonism of these two tendencies or move ments springs the existence known to us through the testimony of our senses . The main characteristic of matter is extension . It is placed  | in space , and as seen by our intellect , it seems essentially discon tinuous . But this is merely an appearance , growing out of the inability of our intellect to grasp the flow of life except in the form of a series of snapshots , each of which gives us an impres sion of immobile discontinuity . The essential quality of life , on the other hand , is duration , and duration means flow , change , but also continuity , the underlying unity of all existence . For " duration , " says Bergson , " is the continuous progress of the past , which gnaws into the future and which swells as it ad vances . " This is the one reality on which we may build our worldconception ; and time must be held real , both because it is irre versible , and because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never be lost again . Memory is the pres ence within us of the whole past , ever pressing forward for admission , but it is revealed to us in fragmentary form only because the intellect refuses to pick out from the host of memories anything that is not needed for impending action . Each new moment of our lives is seen by Bergson as a com plex state , logically derived but unforeseeable . The element of uniqueness contained in each such state springs from the choice which our intellect makes between reactions that are equally pos sible . " Each human work in which there is invention , " he says , " every voluntary act in which there is freedom , every movement of an organism that manifests spontaneity , brings something new into the world . " Thus , like James , he resists and resents the categorical alternative of the old philosophies , which declared that man must be either the complete master of his fate or its predestined slave . To him life is free within limits ? or , as Schopenhauer expressed it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under necessity . " At the bottom of life itself , this movement that opposes and upholds matter , Bergson sees a vast , universal , groping force , an all-embracing impetus , that he names the elan vital ? the I , ifeUrge . Under the pressure of this impetus , existence is con stantly diverging , sheaf-like , from the common root . Each added divergence implies a search in new directions for some faculty essential to further progress . Thus appear the clear- ages , first between vegetables , designed to store energy , and animals , designed to expend it , and later between animals , moved by instinct , and men , guided by intellect . Existence , viewed in this manner , is neither accidental , as modern science would have us believe , nor shaped according to some preconceived plan , as the older philosophies believed . It is , instead , experimental . The Life-Urge seems to know what it needs only when it has obtained it , and thus life is led into many side-paths and blind alleys , though along its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this vital force and our own relationship to it , as well as to the rest of the universe , are summed up by Bergson in this more than usually lucid and striking passage : " As the smallest grain of dust is bound up with our entire solar system , drawn along with it in that undivided movement of descent which is materiality itself , so all organized beings , from the humblest to the highest , from the first origins of life to the time in which we are , and in all places as in all times , do but evidence a single impulsion , the inverse of the movement of matter , and in itself indivisible . All the living hold together , and all yield to the same tremendous push . The animal takes its stand on the plant , man bestrides animality , and the whole of humanity , in space and in time , is one immense army galloping beside and before and behind each of us in an overwhelming charge able to beat down every resistance and clear the most formidable obstacles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give only a few salient points of Bergson 's comprehensive world-view , and even these I have barely indicated . Concerning the revolutionary bearing of his ideas on future thought ? that is , of their most important aspect ? I shall have no chance to speak here . He himself refers time and again , not to his own philosophy in this connection , but to one that he expects the future to bring us . Of this coming and more deep-reaching elucidation of life he says : " Unlike the philosophical systems properly so called , each of which was the individual work of a man of genius and sprung up as a whole , to be taken or left , it will only be built up by the collective and progressive effort of many thinkers , of many observers also , completing , correcting and improving one another . "  | In other words , the new world-conception will be evolved by the race-mind itself , not by any individual mind , however great and comprehensive . This means that it will be " revealed " in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was thus that the bibles of mankind were produced ? and as we look ahead from our present position , it seems destined that the future shall have its bibles no less than the past ; that life shall continue to pour its revelations into the hearts and heads of men ; and that each new sacred book conceived by humanity shall leave less of life 's secrets undiscovered . It is on the mak ing of these future bibles that men like James and Bergson are ever at work in a spirit of complete , reverential consecration . And it is for the sake of this work that we , in turn , owe them not only reverence but , above all else , attention .  |
