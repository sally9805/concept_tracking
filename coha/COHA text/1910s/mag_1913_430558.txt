 | As soon as I realized that I had met the girl I wanted to marry , I began to save money . At that time her promise had not yet been obtained , either . It is true that it sounds like a paradox to say that a policy of saving money can go hand in hand with a campaign to win a woman 's heart . However , this is not a story , but is my contribution to an experience meeting upon the subject of matrimony and money , and if truth requires that the probabilities be exceeded , so be it . We hear a good deal nowadays about the high cost of living , and about the effects it produces . One of these effects is said to be a reduction in the number of marriages , not among people who really have little money , it is true , but principally among those fairly well off . Incidentally there is a naval regulation saying that a midshipman may not marry . This , until recently , applied to graduate midshipmen on regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , there are no graduate midshipmen because on leaving the Naval Academy they are , under a recent law , immediately commissioned ensigns . However , it is popularly believed in the navy that marriage was forbidden to graduate midshipmen on grounds of general policy more than from financial considerations . But there is a case or two on record in which the Navy Department 's permission to marry was obtained by a graduate midshipman who convinced the department that his bride-tobe was able to contribute a regular allowance to the matrimonial partnership . In some foreign services , such as the German and Austrian , an officer can not marry unless he can show that he has independent means , or that the bride has a dot , the amount being based upon a sliding scale according to rank . In the English army there is a saying to the effect that a lieutenant must not be married , a captain ought not to be , a major might , and a colonel must be . There is a pretty general service opinion that an officer should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this opinion , which is evidently the result of accumulated experience . Some of the reasons which also apply in civil life have special force in the service . It is admitted that a youth will marry a girl that his judgment somewhat matured would refuse to consider . A mistake thus made is especially unfortunate in the service , where the environment and associations at times can not be changed for extended periods . An officer may be ordered to a navy yard , and be assigned quarters in which he and his wife are to live in that yard . Obviously there must be some social intercourse , even tho it be quiet and simple . A call must be made upon the Commandant and Mrs. Commandant ; calls must be received from others in the yard and returned ; and there will be dinner parties , card parties , teas , dances , and miscellaneous social gatherings of all kinds , of varying degrees of formality . Or this officer may be ordered to a ship , and his wife will , when possible , " follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boarding houses , and thrown into the company of other navy wives , and subjected to their not unkindly , but nevertheless keen scrutiny and impartial appraisal . This nomadic existence , when the  | purse is limited , is not an unmixt joy to any woman , however loving , loyal , and well adapted she may be . And a wife illadapted to service surroundings and associates is a thorn in the flesh of any officer , and ultimately will impair his efficiency . Thus , indirectly , and it must be admitted , that even in more direct ways , an ill-chosen wife may reduce the opportunities , increase the perplexities , and mar the career of her officer husband . Also , due to the requirements of naval service , with its extended cruises , its duty on foreign stations and along unhealthy and semi-civilized or turbulent coasts , there are occasional enforced separations between husband and wife for extensive periods . Wives can hardly follow their husbands to the Atlantic Fleet 's winter drills at Guantanamo , Cuba , or up the Yangtse River in China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to Beirut or Alexandretta in the Near East . For an ill-mated couple , if they are that , these separations are good or bad things , according to the view one chooses to take and the results which follow , but it must be admitted that such separations are unfair to a certain type of woman on the one hand , and on the other , that the man 's permanent happiness is hazarded in a way that should be avoided if possible . Furthermore , to return to my subject , and I ask pardon for the digression , a younger officer receives less pay . He is consequently less able to pay the extraordinary expenses that attend a service life . And these expenses are extraordinary , for service people are frequently transients , and travel is expensive and transient rates are high , even if a modest scale of living is not departed from . Frequently things indispensable at one place are securely stored in another and distant place . There is a limit to what one can carry about , but no limit to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inspired by the greatest of aspirations , I was a lieutenant in the navy . I was on a foreign station . My pay was $264 per month . At my request , the paymaster arranged an allotment of my pay , so that $100 a month was deposited to my credit in a bank at home , About eighteen months elapsed before the wedding , and my al , PENDEN ' 1 ' August 14 lotment amounted to the neat sum of $1800 . Not a fortune , but at least I did not have to borrow money to go on my wedding trip . And that has been done . The Girl and I had talked things over and had decided that we would have just the kind of honeymoon we wanted , but that we would not make a special endeavor to see how much money we could foolishly squander . We realized that we had some time yet to live , that money is also needed after the honeymoon , and that we could not ride thru life in a series of taxicabs at New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I think a young married couple should start right out from the first on a financial basis that it definite . We started with a plan that for our life in the navy has proved itself a success without a change . " We " have had duty ashore , living in a government house for about two years , and I have had about two years at sea , since our marriage , during which latter time my wife has been without a fixt abode . Our scheme was simple . It was based upon equity and cooperation . It did not ignore nor conflict with the natural desire to profit by personal frugality , and the necessary condition that " mine " and " thine " should ever be distinct . This is our plan . At the end of each month , our income for that month , including my pay , and money received by either of us from any source whatever , is pooled into one joint amount , or account , and called , for example , " January income . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . First are paid the joint , or common expenses , which we call " house " expenses . These include all expenses that we mutually agree are properly chargeable against us together . The principle observed is that they must have been common expenses , as distinct from individual expenses . For example , when on shore duty , our list of monthly house expenses would include servants ' wages , grocery bills , expenses for the baby , telephone rental , piano rental , papers and magazines , carriages or taxicabs ( when used jointly ) , doctor 's bills , dentist 's bills , water bills , bills for light , and the scores of other household items . If we made a trip together to the city , or to the thea- ter , it was a house expense . For clubs that gave privileges to each of us , a proper proportion of our dues were included as house expenses . When we are not on shore duty the house expenses include the nurse 's wages , her board and cost of travel , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course most items that are house expenses are clearly such . In case of doubt , we decide together . Sometimes some items on a bill are " house " and other items are " individual . " If so , we separate them as required . I do not believe any real difference of opinion can arise and continue to exist as to what are house expenses . When I travel under orders my expenses are house expenses . My mileage allowance becomes part of our monthly income . Any expense that is inherent in the vocation of the bread winner , and not for his personal advantage , we consider a legitimate charge against the house . Were I a doctor , or lawyer , or merchant , my office or store rent , and pay of employees , would be a house charge . That is , the net business income would be considered as our income . If , during the month , either of us has spent money for the " house " this amount is duly included in the house expenses , and reimbursement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course this is all in a bookkeeping sense , and the money is only paid out when our monthly statement is complete , and we know just what final amounts are to be paid . I keep a bank account , and usually pay the bills by check . Also , I sometimes pay my wife what is due her by check , or make her an advance in that way . Or I can make her cash payments , if desired , when we are not separated . Advances are sometimes required by her , due to house expenses she is paying , or she may need the money herself . After the house expenses are paid , what is left of the month 's income is divided equally between my wife and me . These two sums constitute our individual " shares " for any month . These shares are our own personal allowances , to spend as required for our clothing or other things , or to be saved for future needs . By this scheme my wife , equally with myself , can save up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as some women do , have to spend money to get it . By mutual agreement , before dividing our monthly surplus into shares , we sometimes set aside a sum to swell the " house savings account . " This is an account owned jointly to provide for future house expenses . When the entire statement has been completed at the end of the month , I give my wife the money due her , taking into account her share , advances made her , and money due her previously expended by her for the house . This scheme of first paying common expenses , and then making an equal division , has the merit that it encourages both joint and individual economy . If my wife keeps the grocery bills at a low figure , she profits by it . When the monthly " house " bills come in , she looks them over to see that they are correct . One month she saved us an aggregate of over three dollars in correcting mistakes made in small items . It may be objected that she ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be . But a loyal partner deserves half the profits . That is the corollary to the objection mentioned . This scheme makes a real and interested partnership , with genuine and loyal cooperation . It has proven practicable for us for several years under the most various conditions and changes due to navy life . Our accounts have been simple , and easily and correctly kept . ( And arithemetic is not a strong point with my wife . ) Once a month we spend about half an hour settling our accounts . If we are separated , she sends me a statement , and by return mail she receives a condensed complete statement , and a check squaring accounts for that month . I have stated the general principle of our matrimonial money arrangements . We believe it has a wide practicable application , and could be used by others to their great advantage . We both like it after several years ' trial . That it is practicable is proven by the several years ' successful trial that has convinced us of its virtue .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
