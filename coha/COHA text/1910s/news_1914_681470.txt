This is the result of the Government investigation of New Haven affairs which has progressed for more than a year and which , as regards the civil aspect of the case , was settled by a decree to which both sides agreed before it was presented for Judge Mayer 's signature two weeks ago . Charles S. Mellen , who was the chief witness before the Grand Jury and thus gained immunity , was not indicted . The defendants named in the true bill were William Rockefeller , George Maccu-loch Miller , Charles F. Brooker , William Skinner , D. Newton Barney , Robert W. Taft , James S. Elton . James S. Hemingway . Lewis Cass Ledyard . Charles M. Pratt , A. Heaton Robertson , Frederick F. Brewster . Henry K. , Edward D. Robbins , Alexander Cochrane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ De Witt Cuyler , Theodore N.

Some of them were the leaders in New Haven affairs before the road was reorganized , including Mr. Rockefeller , Mr. Baker , Mr. Ledyard , and Mr. Billard . Mr. Brewster , Mr. , Mr. Cuyler , Mr. Milligan , and Mr. Maxwell are still members of the board . Mr. Robbins has been general counsel of the road . Nearly fifty men , some of whom ' are now dead , were mentioned in the indictment , ashaving conspired with the twenty-one , although they were not indicted . Most prominent among them was the late J. P. Morgan . and some of the others were Chauncey M. Depew , Lucius Tuttle , John M. Hall , Richard A. McCurdy , and Alexander J. Cassatt . The punishment for the alleged crime is one year in prison , a fine of $5,000 , or both . The indictment was handed up in the morning to Judge Foster of Louisiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Assistant Attorney General Frank Swacker . R. L. Betts . and James W. Osborne were present for the Government . and Mr. Osborne asked that bench warrants might issue immediately for the defendants . This was ordered by the court , and the Federal officials immediately began to notify the defendants who were in the city . Geoerge F. Baker and Charles M. Pratt , who had with them John D. Lindsay as their attorney , and Lewis Cass Ledyard , who was represented by John G. Milburn. presented themselves before Judge Foster at 2 o'clock . " George F. Baker to the bar , " called Cleric Leary. and the defendants at once stepped forward to offer pleas of not guilty . Assistant District Attorney Robert Stephenson suggested that ten days be allowed to the defendants in which to withdraw their pleas or to demur , but the Judge considered that three weeks would be a more reasonable period . Bail Fixed at *5,000 . Mr. Lindsay suggested that , considering the standing of the defendants , there really was-no reason why they should be required to give bail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's out on bail , " Mr. Baker was heard to remark to Mr. Milburn. who stood beside him , but Judge Foster thought bail should be given . " It would be more regular , I think . " he remarked . - . I 'll make it $5,000 . There can be no hardship in furnishing it in this case . " There was a general laugh , and the defendants withdrew with their counsel to give bail before Commissioner Hough ! ton . This was furnished for them by I the American Surety Company . Hoffman Miller , son of George Macculloch , another of the defendants , rept resented that his fatter was S2 years old and in very poor health , and that it would be a great hardship if he were forced to appear to plead . Mr. Miller , Sr. , is now in Morristown , N. J. , and , of course , will plead not guilty .

The Conspiracy Charge . In addition to these the . Grand Jury stated it believed there were others whose names were unknown to it with whom the men indicted bad conspired to monopolize interstate commerce . This , it was explained in the Indictment , consisted in the common carrier business of transporting passengers and property by railroad , by water . ' and by both from New Jersey . New York , Connecticut , Rhode Islana , marettehusetts . Vermont . Maine , and New Hampshire to other Slates . The indictment gave a list of the transportation companies which it was alleged had been merged in the New Haven system . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston Maine , the Boston &; Albany , the Central New England Railway Company , the Central Vermont Railway Company , the Eastern Steamship Corporation , the Joy Steamship Company . the Merchants and Miners ' Transportation Company , the Maine Steamship Company . the Metropolitan Steamship Company , the New York &; New England Railroad Company , the New York , Westchester S7 , Boston . the New York , Ontario &; ' Western , the Connecticut Company , the Rhode Island Company . and the Rutland Railroad Company . It was noticed that in drawing priminal charges from the development df the . New Haven the Government disregarded the compromise which it reached with the present management of the company in arriving at the settlement of the civil ' dissolution suit . in that it was content with the abandonment by the New ! Hat en of its control over the New England trolley lines , the coast steamship lines , the Merchants and Miners ' - Company . and its connection with the Boston &; Maine and the Boston S. Albany . It left to the Interstate Commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation with the Sound steamship lines , and bad nothing to say about the Central New England , the New York &; New England . . ? ? the Rutland , and thminfew York . Ontario &; Western Railroads , In the indictment the Government ? went back to July 2 , 1890 , and found that front that time until ; the , actual presentation of ' the indictment yesterday there , had been a conspiracy to form a monopoly by acquiring the stock or control of all the subsidiary companies of the New Haven , whether they were left to it in accordance with the civil . decree or net . It ' is likely that the de- ' Pendants will bring this point up in the demurrers which they are expected to file . Question of Immunity . It is believed that some of the defendants may raise the plea that as they have testified on New Haven affairs be , fere the Interstate Commerce Commission they are entitled to immunity . As Mr. Mellen has been the chief witness , before the Grand Jury it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was called upon to give evidence at Washington It was suggested that thereby he had won immunity for himself . Those Who now may put forward the same plea are.Mr . Skinner , Mr. Hillard , and Mr. Cuyler . They were sworn and gave such teetimony as they were asked for . In addition Mr. Ledyard and ' Mr. Robbins submitted to the commission unaworn statements . The men charged with conspiracy , it was alleged , took advantage of the fact that . the New Haven was the only railroad of any importance which led from New York City to the New England Stales , and treated it as a nucleus to " bring as many of said common carriers and their properties and facilities for carrying on said commerce under their influence , management , domination . and ownership , ' The Grand Jury asserted that the measures taken to bring this about were " unfair , undue , unreasonable , and unlawful practices . " Special mention was made of the purchase of the Joy Steamship Company by the New Maven. and the use made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is alleged that the men indicted used ' the ' Joy Company and the United Steamship Company , although the fact that they were controlled by the New Haven was kept concealed , " to engage in such destructive competition for limited times , with suchundeoeirnmuolne carriers as had not come domination and control of said New Haven company , that such common carriers would either be destroyed or compelled to conic under such domination and control . " The Grand Jury summed up the case . by representing that the men indicted used , or threatened to use , the advantage of position of the New Haven " to grasp the commerce riehtfully and normally belonging to " the transportation corporations which the indictment . enumerated . The process which brought the defendants before the courts began with the pressure put on the New York &; New England Railroad Company in 1891 by the New Haven . which resulted in the first investigation of the latter 's methods by the Massachusetts Legislature . This ended in the purchase by the New Haven and the New York Central of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the throwing of the New York &; New England into a receivership . Series of Mergers and Leases . Iii 1893 the New Haven leased the Old Colony Company and formed the first ; agreement with the Boston &; Maine Rail ; road . Meanwhile a series of mergers and leases were in progress , by which the New Haven absorbed small railroad lines in New England , and in 1890 it acquired a majority of the stock of the Boston Terminal Company , ' which controlled the terminals in Boston . In 1004 the New Haven acquired the Central New England , and in the following year the New York , Ontario &; Western . Three years later the Boston &; Maine passed finally under New Haven ownership , and the agreement for the joint operation of the Boston A : Albany a as made wzttl the New 1 ork Central . In June , 1909 , ithe Boston Railroad Holding Company ' , was organized , and in February , 191121 the New York Central sold to the ? Cea- Haven the Rutland Railroad . ** in 1912 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J.

Between . 1000 and 11 ) 03 it took over the New Haven Steamboat Company , the New London Steamboat Company , and the Bridgeport Steamboat Company , ? and in 1904 to ' 1905 it sold its steamship holdings to the New England Navigation Company , which sold them in 1007 to the Consolidated Railway Company , which , in its turn , was merged with the New Haven . In 1011 the Eastern ' Steamship Corporation , another New Raven subsidiary , took over the Metropolitan , the Maine . and the Eastern steamship Companies . and the New England Navigation Company , by secretly buying up the stock of ' the Joy Line , was able to drive out all competition . In this way the New Haven acquired twenty-two of the thirty steamship lines serving New England , Control of Trolley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trolley lines began to disturb the New Haven , and , beginning with the purchase in 1805 of the Stanford Street Railway Company . it by 1900 had obtained the ownership of 1,500 of the 1,65n miles of trolley lines in Rhode Island , and all but 110 miles of the trolleys in Connecticut . In Massachusetts , it had , practically everything south of the Boston &; Albany line and west of Worcester . Then . in 1906. occurred the Westchester deal , by which it acquired the New York , Westchester &; Boston at , approximately . 812,000,000 in , ore than its value , according to the Government . This was merged with the New York &; Port Chester in 1910. and last year earned $400,000 less than its operating expenses . It was remembered that at the annual meeting of the New Haven last week Mr. Elliott had given out some notes with regard to the personnel of the Present board of the company in which five of the men indicted still have seats . Mr. Brewster , who was elected on May 0 , 1907 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the company and had been identified with the financial and industrial life of the community . Praised by Mr. Elliott . Mr. , who has also been a Director since May , 1907. was said by Mr. Elliott to have been helpful to the New Haven in its financing and by.his good advice and criticism . Mr. Cusle ? , whose service on the board dates from October , 1910 , was referred to as a representative stockholder from Pennsylvania with much experience in large corporations and financial affairs , and Mr. Maxwell , who joined the directorate in May , 1911 , was said to have been most active in the last year in trying to better the position of the company . Mr. Milligan , who also became a Director in 11 ) 11 , was praised as a most earnest student of the conditions surrounding the company and for his activity in safeguarding its interests .
