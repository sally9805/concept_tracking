 | The same season that has witnessed the spirited attack on the vogue of O. Henry by Mr. Brownell , at the annual meeting of the National Academy of Arts and Letters , brings to us a biography and criticism by Professor Smith . The volume comes at an opportune time to stimulate the already widespread interest in this writer and to satisfy the curiosity of the public with regard to the details of a life that proves as romantic as any of his stories . It is rather significant that the life of this most unacademic of men should be written by the Poe Professor of English Literature at the University of Virginia ? a scholar who proves himself to be as sympathetic and enthusiastic as any man of the O. Henry type could have been . There is no condescension , no aloofness , but imaginative sympathy of a rare quality . Furthermore , Dr. Smith 's long study of the short story has admirably fitted him for his estimate of the technique and rank of O. Henry 's stories as compared with his predecessors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suggestion of the parallel between O. Henry 's life and the technique of his stories ? a parallel worked out with delicate charm by the author . The quiet and arrestive beginning in Greensboro , the first " guess " based on his life on the ranch in Texas and later in Austin and Houston , the first surprise at the shadowed years of his prison life , and the second surprise in the triumphant conclusion of his last days in New York ? " the culmination of tendencies and impulses that we now know had stirred mightily within him from the beginning " ? these parallels serve as an admirable introduction to the volume . Professor Smith naturally dwells at some length upon his ancestry , his early environment in the then " somnolent town " of Greensboro , and the southern qualities that entered later into his work . Of this life the biographer was himself a part , and he therefore sketches it with rare understanding and sym- pathy . A famous old school where O. Henry read much and drew cartoons of various types and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearing house of the town ? were the real substitute for the more academic training he might have had . He graduated early in the school of human nature . It is not a surprise to close readers of his stories , who have noticed his many literary allusions , to be told of his extensive reading in his early days , although one would scarcely have imagined him " devouring " Hume , Macaulay , Green , and Guizot , or reading Burton 's " Anatomy of Melancholy . " His passionate reading of " dime novels " was happily balanced by his appreciation of standard novels . We are more surprised to learn of his discipline in writing . During the ten or twelve years of his life in Texas , like Hawthorne and Stevenson , he spent much time in writing and destroying until in the fulness of time he came forth master of a fluent and even distinguished style . The widening horizons of his life on a Texas ranch and in all kinds of business at Austin and Houston were suddenly narrowed to the walls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient with the criticism that the biographer should have omitted all reference to these shadowed years ; he could not have avoided the revelation of what had become common report . Furthermore , these years had no little significance in his expanding life ? not otherwise would he have sounded the depths of human sympathy , or passed from the scintillation of his early years to the creative power of his later . A more pertinent criticism is that a more persistent search for material would have yielded more evidence as to the circumstances surrounding his conviction . However the reader is inclined to accept the author 's verdict , he does not feel assured by the evidence in hand . This criticism applies perhaps to other periods of Porter 's life . It may be that the inclination of O. Henry to destroy any material that might furnish literary twaddle after his death or that the space put at the author 's command by his publishers may have precluded a longer biography ; but many readers close the volume feeling that they have not been satisfied .  | page deleted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
