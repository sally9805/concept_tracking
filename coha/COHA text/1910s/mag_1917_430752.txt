 | ONE of the chief objects of my recent visit to China was to ascertain , if possible , the actual attitude of the Chinese people towards Japan . For many years I have held the belief that in the ultimate solution of Pacific problems no factor will be more important than China 's appraisal of Japanese policies and purposes . Needless to say , the ideas and opinions set forth in the following pages are neither authorized nor gratuitous reflections of the official or individual views of those constituting the government of China . Precedent and prudence necessarily restrict official outgivings ; and , as Judge Elbert H. Gary and others have testified , the present government of China is composed of able , prudent men . The Chinese , also , are proverbial respecters of precedent ; none more fine than they when it is a question of observing etiquette . " Proper custom " is still honored in official as well as in private life in China . While , therefore , a distinction should and must be made between official China 's attitude towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care has been taken to interpret as fairly as possible the general disposition of the Chinese on these matters , irrespective of  | class or condition , party affiliation or particular place of residence , north as well as south of the Yangtze valley . Chinese opinions , especially on public matters , are no more difficult to ascertain than are American or European opinions . There is nothing " inscrutable " or mystifying about Chinese character or Chinese manners and methods . The Chinese are very much like other human beings in motive and intent , hard as it seems to be for some foreigners to realize it . The difficulty is chiefly with the foreigner . Also , in the summer of 1916 several events occurred which presented numerous opportunities , each in its own way helping to answer this question ? not a simple one , by any means , although some writers regard it as such . When we speak of the Chinese people , it should be borne in mind , we are discussing almost one-quarter of the population of the world . To ascertain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the merely political elements will not suffice . Probably at no time and in no place has there been , or could there be , less warrant to approach such a question from the merely political angle . The politics of China , of Japan ? of the Orient at large ? resemble a great river flowing through a level country , which , swollen by turbulent tributaries , threatens to overflow its banks . Many things may happen , politically , which might build the necessary dam and utilize to good purpose these converging political tides in the Orient ; many things may happen , politically , to undermine the restraining dikes and river walls and to hasten the inundation . Yet , in spite of or because of this condition of extreme instability , the political elements can not be overlooked . Examining conditions and tendencies as they presented themselves during the avalanche of events which swept China from April to September , 1916 , it became more and more apparent to me that China will come to her final decision very largely , if not wholly , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contravention of vital Chinese moral principles and the conservation or alienation of material resources . China desires a peaceful understanding with Japan ? let there be no misconception as to that . But the terms must be honorable to both parties ; they can not be dictated at Tokyo in denial of Chinese rights and aspirations . Of this fact I am firmly convinced . The attitude of the assembly regarding the Japanese loan of November , 1916 , and its determination not to permit the alienation of the extremely valuable mines as security therefor confirms this view . China desires peace . " The old gods are not yet dead , " and , not merely among the elders but on the lips of her young men , too , I found ample testimony of abiding faith in those ancient principles which might be epitomized : The Spirit is mightier than the sword . The message the Christian missionaries brought to China consolidated and confirmed respect for traditional truths such as " We do not make swords of our best iron , or soldiers of our favorite sons . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor . It is not a peace which might succeed the Manchu by a Tenno . The Chinese people are not too proud to fight . If ill-fortune should so will it that the issue must come to trial by the sword , the Chinese , however reluctantly , will take up the sword ; and , weighing carefully the cost , the dangers , the difficulties , they have no misgivings as to the ultimate outcome . They are by no means lacking in courage , even though they are discreet . A short time before I went to China I had a very interesting conversation with one who has enjoyed exceptional opportunities as an observer of Oriental developments . Relations between China and Japan were strained . Many usually wellinformed Americans assumed that China would yield at all points . " For the sake of the world , I hope not , " said this experienced observer : " China has huge reserves of strength . She might be beaten back temporarily , but she could gather her strength in the interior , where the expense of continual struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers would smother him . The successful conquest of China is an impossibility . " I believe that to be true . The decisive thing , however , is not our American beliefs or deductions , but rather China 's view of the matter . China has made up her mind . She is facing a very difficult situation frankly , thoughtfully ,  | temperately , and with determination ; and on this matter both parties , military and radical , are in full accord . She is sensible of her own past errors ? or , to be more correct , errors thrust upon her by circumstances over which she has had little if any control . She desires , if needs be she will demand , as far as historical conditions make it possible , a clean slate and a fresh start . And she is neither selfish nor revengeful in her present disposition . She recognizes the justice , the prudence , the necessity of considering the rights and requirements of others as well as her own rights and needs . She recognizes particularly the evil consequences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the middle . She is determined that Chinese treaties when freely made shall be sacred things and not scraps of paper . Consequently , she will not buy peace at the cost of nullification of the vested interests legitimately and fairly acquired by any treaty power or its citizens . She recognizes the desirability of concentrating immediate attention upon the development of her vast resources . She is glad to get foreign aid in this work ; but she does not recognize the right of any nation to step in without her free consent and alienate from her people these resources . She recognizes the necessity of reorganizing from top to bottom her entire administrative mechanism . She has already made not a little progress along these lines , aided materially by foreign advice and assistance in many instances , but with a much greater measure of Chinese initiative and executive skill than is even suspected abroad . She welcomes a continuance of foreign advice and assistance . She rejects tutelage under duress . Above all , she declines to become a party to any sort of Asiatic confederation or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Roughly sketched , these are the dominant ideas under which it may be said the people of China are preparing to arrange the general form of their attitude towards Japan . If Japan frames her Chinese policy so as to cooperate with China along these lines , there will be no difficulty , no danger . But if Japan fails to recognize China 's right to have a controlling voice in her own destiny , there will surely be difficulty , there will be danger for Japan . There is no use mincing words about the matter . The new government of China is not swayed by anti-Japanese sentiment . Quite the contrary . In all my talks with Chinese officials I gathered the impression that there is a very deep and sincere desire to aid into being if it may be possible a new era of mutual respect , mutual understanding , mutual confidence . That impression was not shaken by what transpired as a consequence of the unfortunate and reprehensible Chengchiatung affair . Indeed , it was strengthened substantially , because in that matter China 's foreign office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion where unwise Japanese pugnacity revealed itself at its very worst . According to the most trustworthy information , without moral or legal excuse , Japanese soldiers had violated China 's sovereignty . Yet , instead of manifesting resentment ? however warranted ? the Chinese officials exerted @#  | themselves to meet with prudence and with dignity an ugly situation . The Chinese are patient to a fault . But they are not " sheep . " In their quiet , uncomplaining way they bitterly resent some things said about them by superficial judges . For instance , when an American statesman , without any unfriendly intention , of course , quoting an expression used in a letter which he had received from an American friend in China , gave the prominence which is always his popular prerogative to the " sheep " myth , and talked and wrote about " unchinafying " America , the Chinese regretted this very much , because they felt it to be most unfair , though coming from one of their best friends and well-wishers . In the same way , when a New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and the remark was copied by the enterprising Chinese newspapers , anger seethed in many Chinese hearts . Chinese patience can be strained too far . The Chinese feel that Japan is mainly responsible for the tension put upon Chinese patience . Japanese tell us that one of the reasons why they are more competent than Americans to direct the development of China is that they understand the Chinese because they are neighbors , and that we do not because an ocean divides us from China . The assertion is very plausible , on the surface , and it has deceived many influential Americans . As a matter of fact , it is utterly untenable . It is repudiated by the Chinese themselves . It is rejected by those relatively few Japanese who do understand their Chinese neighbors . To my mind this is one of the false assumptions which are at the very bottom of Sino-Japanese troubles and dangers . Chinese say that those who understand them best ? as well , indeed , as they understand themselves ? are a few Americans and Englishmen who have lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ womanhood , and who combine intense loyalty to America or to England with an almost equally intense affection for the Chinese and a belief in the future of China . There is such a thing as being " too close to the picture . " China is a beautiful and extremely valuable picture , and Japan , China 's neighbor , sees only the paint , though she has a very keen appreciation of the " values . " In every essential of national consciousness the Chinese and Japanese peoples are as widely removed as the poles . Their tastes , their achievements , their aspirations are very different . " Bushido , " says that gifted Japanese author , Dr. Nitobe Inazo , the very highest authority on the subject , " made the sword its emblem of power and prowess . When Mahomet proclaimed that the sword is the key of heaven and of hell ' he only echoed a Japanese sentiment . " And of the Japanese swordsmith , declares the interpreter of " The Soul of  | Japan , " he " was not a mere artisan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " he committed his soul and spirit into the forging and tempering of the steel . " Does this suggest the patient , peace-loving Chinese , the " sheep " that is lampooned in American cartoon and stinging paragraph ? Or the dignified scholar , quite possibly a priest whom Durer 's Saint Jerome might well typify ? Or any of the wayside artists whose skilful brush with a few strokes paints to the life the warbling bird or playful kitten ? In Japan " the merchant was placed lowest in the category of vocations . " In China the teacher has been exalted , the merchant has been respected , while " the soldier was placed lowest in the category of vocations . " They regret that they may perforce have to change this order for a time . Politically speaking , the soul of Japan , to-dav , is still what it was under the Amazon Empress , Jingo . Dr. William Elliot Griffs , one of Japan 's best friends and ablest defenders , wrote only a month or two ago : " Seen in the perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swamped in militarism . Japan 's once-splendid scheme of a university in each of the eight great divisions of the empire has come very close to disgraceful failure . Academic freedom is yet far from a reality . Labor has not been honored . Military glory has been transfigured and war-making honored beyond its deserts , while against money-grubbing , at the expense of health and life , there is scarce protection by law . The fighter is still esteemed above the inventor , healer , or artisan . The manifest result is that Japan is still curiously deficient in highgrade machinists , in intelligent mechanics , and in the finer lines of the newer industries . She is far from being able to compete in the more elaborate machinery or products , while her statutes for the protection of the factory laborer are weak apologies for what they should be . " The new government in China owes its existence , mainly , to unwavering Chinese loyalty to Chinese moral law . It owes nothing to Japan but difficulties . It owes 153  | very much to the patriotic persistence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yuan-hung , Premier Tuan Chi-jui , Dr. Chen Chin-tao , Dr. Wu Ting-fang , Mr. Liang Ch'i-ch'ao , Dr. C. T. Wang , General Tsai Ao , and others . The Chinese who represent their ideals think of their country as a national treasure won by courageous adherence to moral ideals . To them it is a choice jade among the gems which the centuries have ennobled in settings fashioned out of the very heartbeats of reverent sons of Han . " Rather be dashed to fragments as a piece of jade than held together as a lump of brick . " In spite of the bickerings and the selfish motives of some of the contestants and such are always found in all countries ? that was in reality the sign under which the opponents of monarchy conquered during the winter of 1915 and the spring of 1916 . It expressed the spirit of China , the great moral force which governs China 's many millions from Hanlin Optimus to common coolie . The man who voiced this phrase , Mr. Liang Ch'i-ch'ao , was a reformer in Canton when Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinese people towards Japan is , perforce , colored by thoughts and memories of this very onesided struggle . They will tell you that most of the present sorrows and humiliations of China are direct consequences of the war ; that it brought down upon their defenseless country the wolf-pack of the land-hungry nations and forged the first link in the yoke of the indemnities . They will tell you that it was the greed of the legations which steeled the hearts of the reformers in 1898 , and which also produced the Boxer tragedy of 1900 . The Chinese who are moulding the new republic have spoken of these things constantly in their friendly gatherings . The emphasis does not lessen as the years pass . As the Chinese of the younger generation note the added respect and prestige that prowess in arms has won for Japan , is it strange that they at times ask themselves if they , too , to win respect and their normal rights , must resort to force rather than rely on reason and justice ? Must they , too , get ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unjust aggression ? They feel that with their four hundred millions , and the bravery and skill that their ancestors often showed , they can win by fighting if they must win that way . I have heard these questions discussed with becoming gravity and modest determination by groups of China 's best young men . And this is merely one reason why I say neither Mancho nor Tenno nor any alien can ever hope to conquer the will of the Chinese people . For the mind of China is at last made up . The truth of the saying as to the movement of large bodies will suggest itself . It applies to the China of to-day and yesterday . In the present political life of China , Mr. Liang is playing the useful part of an interested observer . When he declared against Yuan he gave his word that he would neither seek nor accept office . Before the Yunnan revolution he was among the most active and able members of the Council of State . His first act as a state councillor was to press to a favorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With commendable foresight he urged the importance of seeking immediate and amicable settlement of the Manchurian and Mongolian boundary questions and other vexed Sino-Japanese problems . Japan replied , on the very first opportunity , with the infamous twenty-one demands . In spite of the self-control exhibited , the rage created in Chinese breasts by these demands is something beyond the imagination of the average American . It was but mildly reflected in the millions subscribed to the National Salvation Fund and the National Patriotic Loans , many of the subscribers of which even today do not present for payment their interest coupons . Their " loan " was a free gift . It gave Yuan an opportunity for great public service which a few months later was snatched from him by unwise strivings towards imperialism . Many attempts have been made to justify or to palliate the Peking monarchical movement of 1915 . It is an impossible task . One need not bandy epithets or criticise methods or question motives . I can well believe that some participants sincerely thought that they were acting patriotically for their country 's good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledged to many whom he  | took into his confidence that it was ? if not a colossal crime ? at the very least a monumental , unpardonable blunder . It injured China , cruelly , at a crucial moment in the life of China . Because of one unfortunate factor in the movement it brought into disrepute in China American political advice , American scholarship , and American sincerity in the pursuit of political ideals . Yet , the consequences of this movement have been in some respects favorable . The monarchist argument which chiefly moved the Chinese themselves was the assertion of the urgent necessity for concentrating all the military strength of China under the hand of one man so that " China 's weakness should no longer invite insult . " There was no thought of aggression , so far as I could gather while I was in the Far East ; there was the will to protect China against further aggression . The call of the country had been heard by the shepherd tending his flocks on the great slopes of China 's far west , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small merchant in his tiny shop . Coins , green with hoary age , had been counted out of rusted receptacles and passed from hand to hand until they reached the general fund in Shanghai . The merchant and official stood side by side with the coolie and common outcast as this money was being turned over at the Chinese banks . China 's patriotic reply to Japan was spontaneous and nationwide , extending to the Chinese overseas , who likewise contributed their hundreds of thousands . The fund was the active retort ; the deadly Chinese boycott was the passive retort . The first was most effective in stimulating China 's thorough nationalization ; the second was far more effective in , temporarily at least , restraining the vaulting ambitions of Japan . Among what might be called the numerous " legends " associated with the genesis of the Chouan Hui , the most active agency employed for the promotion of the monarchist plans , was one which received quite a fair measure of credence for some time in Peking . A certain able Chinese was a " power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won a notable reputation for ability as a financial and administrative expert , also as a politician . @# He is now living abroad , but before the decline and death of Yuan he was one of the most influential men in the Chinese capital . Shortly after the presentation of Dr. Goodnow 's memorandum , according to this Peking " legend , " this official received a visit from Dr. Hioki , the Japanese minister , who , it is said , pointed out the very serious character of the growing resentment against Japan , referring particularly to the Salvation Fund and the boycott . He is credited with suggesting to this intimate associate of Yuan that something be done to divert the mind of the people . The latter , according to the story , bethought himself of a subject broached by an earlier visitor , one who sought to play the part of a Chinese Warwick . The subject was the utilization of the Goodnow memorandum ( a purely academic discussion , Dr. Goodnow 's friends in Peking say , written hastily in response to a general question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it ) as a very suitable peg upon which to hang the incipient monarchist agitation . It is asserted by several people who certainly were in the confidence of the more active monarchists that , during this interview , the project was laid before Dr. Hioki , unofficially , of course , and that the Japanese minister was " sounded " with the knowledge and expectation that he would report the conversation to the Japanese foreign office . Be this as it may ( and I do not vouch for the facts ; I only know the rumor ) , the " diversion " developed into a civil war which terminated only with the death of Yuan . Strong as was the resentment against Japan , the moral uprising against Yuan when the monarchist movement developed was still stronger . And in the crisis which was thus precipitated in China , Japanese diplomacy failed to rise to the necessities of the time . The wise course would have been a policy of strict non-interference , leaving the Chinese to settle the matter among themselves . That was the policy pursued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently deliberately and with selfish intent the course most calculated to embarrass and antagonize both parties . It is absurd to say that the revolution  | was promoted or planned in Tokyo . It was not . It was promoted and planned in China . But in many ways which were brought to my attention Japanese officials exerted themselves to intensify the trouble . There is on record , gathered by impartial foreigners , a long list of incidents in Shantung deliberately engineered by Japanese with undoubtedly hostile intent towards China . I have had personally independent accounts by capable observers who understand and speak the Chinese language , confirming many of these incidents ? any one of which might have caused complications disastrous to the plans of both the monarchists and the opponents of monarchy . Some of the worst acts of interference came after an armistice had been declared , when both sides were earnestly trying to compose their differences . The only object that any one , Chinese , American , or European , could see for such moves was to weaken China and to afford an excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more troops , " guards , " into China ? and this was done . It is also true that Japan did not even pretend to discourage the monarchist movement until the de facto government of China was hopelessly committed to the enthronement of Yuan . Then , and not until then , came the protest ? which the Chinese of all parties regarded as a hypocritical impertinence . The saddest chapter of all , however , ? looking at the matter from a broad , impartial standpoint , was the petty , cavilling spirit manifested by Japan in her hour of greatest opportunity . Scarcely was Yuan in his coffin and the popular new President installed when a paltry police-court scuffle was magnified into a cases belli , while Japanese soldiers and Japanese ships of war were employed to overawe the government of China . The Chinese are perplexed by the peculiarities of Japanese diplomacy . " Extratextual " interpretations have not impressed the people of China , who believe with Kung Fu-tze that " Sincerity is the beginning and the end of all things ; nothing suffices without sincerity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what Japanese most unfairly call the Japanese " Monroe Doctrine for Asia . " Japan has already gone vastly beyond any act even most remotely contemplated under our Monroe Doctrine . John Hay declared the true Monroe Doctrine for China . All the world would be glad to see Japan enforce that . The Chinese have , they believe , ample warrant for suspicion . They know that this suspicion is shared by those Americans and Europeans who are best informed as to Chinese and general Oriental conditions . Professor Stanley K. Hornbeck , in " Contemporary Politics in the Far East , " expresses the situation very much as the Chinese themselves feel it : " Whatever her intentions , Japan has accomplished in regard to China at least five things : She has consolidated her own position in her northern sphere of influence , Manchuria ; she has driven the Germans out of their former sphere of influence , Shantung , and has constituted herself successor to Germany 's rights ; she has given warning that she considers Fukien Province an exclusive sphere for Japanese influence ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she stands in a position to menace and to dictate to the Peking government . A glance at the map of north China will show how completely Peking is at Japan 's mercy . In control of Port Arthur and of the Shantung Peninsula , Japan commands the entrance to the Gulf of Pechili , which is the doorway by sea to Tien-tsin and Newchwang . In possession of Tsingtao , Dairen , and ( virtually ) of Antung and Newchwang , Japan thus commands every important port and harbor north of the Yangtse . With the Manchurian railways penetrating the heart of Manchuria and the Shantung Railway extending to the heart of Shantung ? and with the right to extend the latter line to join the Peking-Hankow line , Japan is in a position , should she so choose , at any moment to grind Peking between the millstones of her military machine . So far as strategy is concerned , Japan has north China commercially , militarily , and politically at her mercy . " China can not close her eyes to these facts . Japan herself never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nippon is the soul of the soldier . The reminder is particularly unwelcome in China , just now . @#  | The most significant fact , the most magnificent testimonial of Chinese adherence to principle , supplied during the recent Chinese civil war , was China 's willingness to risk even external menace rather than tolerate domestic disloyalty , an action taken even against the advice of many of China 's best , most sincere friends . Kung-pao was the title given to the imperial guardians of the " days of the empire . " No higher honorary official station was open to a Chinese . Yuan , a lifelong servant of the " Old Buddha , " became Yuan Kung-pao as Tsu Hsi prepared to " mount the Dragon " ( i. e. , to die ) . For an imperial guardian to usurp the Dragon Throne was , in the Chinese mind , an unthinkable thing . It was contrary to Chinese morality . For Yuan to break the oaths which he had taken to uphold the republic was contrary to Chinese morality . In the minds of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon Chinese character through the doctrine enunciated by Mo-ti , a philosopher who flourished more than five centuries before Christ . Mo-ti preached the beauty and utility of love and peace . His views undoubtedly influenced very largely the sages who succeeded him ? Laotze , Kung Fu-tze , and Men-tze . Wrongs , sufferings innumerable , the rude succession of sharp jolts which belligerent aliens have given China , do not seem to have shaken her out of her belief in and respect for love and peace . True it is that the Chinese , like ourselves , have been compelled to resort to measures of military preparedness ; but the difficulties obstructing adequate military preparedness in China are distressingly grave . They are not confined to matters of money or munitions . A nation can not consistently subscribe to pacifism through many centuries without internal as well as external dangers ; and to China one of the internal dangers just now is that of military intrigue . The old-style soldier is often ignorant and vicious because his profession was proverbially under a ban ; sometimes not merely the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the bandits who plagued and preyed upon the millions of peace-practising Chinese . Of such was more than one notorious mili- tary leader who was until recently much under the eyes of the American public in newspaper despatches from China . The Chinese realize that a great deal remains to be done in the way of preaching and practising patriotism in military service before China can risk the creation of an adequate standing army . The Chinese soldier must be taught that his loyalty is to his country and not merely to his general , and that the service is not chiefly a means of livelihood , but rather the performance of a patriotic duty . Lessons of centuries have to be unlearned . Now , for two reasons , chiefly , the Chinese people very deeply resent the pressure which is being put upon them by the Japanese , compelling them to hasten military preparedness . They resent the compulsion , because the time itself is unpropitious to them ; but their resentment is even more largely due to the moral objection . The Chinese know that peace is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , and that hate is bad . And they fear the effect of militarism , not merely upon themselves , but upon the whole world . They do not wish a large army . Yet Yuan Sh'ih-k'ai built up the nucleus of a well-trained army , and well-trained officers of Europe have test : - fied to the good work of China 's army . The last revolution saw in Seeding " ' that the Chinese have in them the power to make in due time a real army . For the present the economic and financial preparedness must take precedence .. But an army will be created if need be , and a strong beginning has been made . If Japan is sincere in her fear of European aggression in China , she will welcome any such preparations . It will never be teed aggressively . That Japan has given the Chinese good . reason to doubt Japanese good to resent the attitude towards China manifested by most Japanese . is frequently admitted by the more conservative observers within the Japanese Empire . While I was in the Orient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of - organizing " Japanese friendship with India " in the interests of business . " The Japan Chronicle , having in mind editorials supporting this campaign printed in the I'orodzu and other Japanese newspapers , made the following caustic comment :  | " It is rather singular that , holding such views as they do about Indian friendship , Japanese journalists and politicians should concern themselves so little about Chinese good-will . There are , from time to time , it is true , pronouncements in favor of improving Sino-Japanese relations , but they seldom take the form of a demand for meticulously respecting Chinese rights . Yet there are 400,000 , - 000 people in China who , unless their human nature is of a different quality from that of the Indians , should be all the better customers of Japan for being on the friendliest possible footing . Indeed , if the Yorodzu 's argument applies to any country , it is to China , which is almost the only land where a boycott has been proved to be an effective means of protest against the doings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We hear little enough of the necessity of maintaining a warm friendship with the Chinese Government , and at the same time refraining from action which may give umbrage to Chinese who are not satisfied with that government . On the contrary , the demand is always that an excuse be found for intervention and for the establishment of the fundamental policy . ' It is curious that simultaneously with Japanese in Peking issuing a manifesto declaring that no other interests in China but those of Japan are worthy of consideration ( a statement frequently made in Japanese newspapers and political speeches ) , a prominent newspaper should argue that Britain has no right to question Japan 's claim to the reversion of the whole of Germany 's and Austria 's trade in India and the East generally , and that , whilst a mythical ancient friendship with India is invoked , the real and undeniable indebtedness of Japan to China is forgotten . " Mention has already been made of Chinese reverence for their fatherland . Often one may see deeply affecting evidences of this devotion . A Chinese leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the soil of his country , and this he will guard as his most precious possession . Laboring hard among strangers , in America or in Europe , he will save his money , no matter how small his earnings , so that if he should die his ashes may be returned to the land which gave him birth . While the sages warned against pampering the flesh , exalting the soul and mind , and deeming the body merely a corrupt thing , at best ? " the stinking bag , " as Sinologues express it ? earth was given place immediately below heaven in the worship and in the thoughts of the people . It was Chinese disinclination to trifle with the earth which retarded so long the opening up of roads and railways and the development of China 's great mineral wealth . Bearing these facts in mind , it is easy enough to understand something at least of how the Chinese are stirred by Japanese efforts to alienate the natural resources of China . There is sentiment in their attitude ; filial piety and patriotism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrewd sense of the practical elements in the matter . The industrial leaders of China can not , under present circumstances , accept as a convincing argument against their own interests the Japanese plea that " Japan must have possession of China 's mines because Japan needs steel so badly that she is compelled to import seventy-five per cent of her metals . " The Chinese are disposed to utilize Chinese ores for works of peace . They feel that Japan is inclined to exploit them against the interests of China and of China 's friends . The way in which Japanese have schemed to seize possession of the Hanyehping properties , including the great Tayeh mines and the Hanyang Iron Works in the very heart of China , has aroused indignation among Chinese industrial promoters , and wageearners , too . The Chinese desire to develop properties like the Hanyehping with American capital and American-made machinery . Japan , they say , interferes with such investments . Japan , they add , is blocking the development of urgently needed new railways , in the same way and for the selfsame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best serve her own interests by co-operating through Japan in China . " They interpret this suggestion as actually meaning Japanese employment of American capital to alienate the resources of China . Is it a wrong interpretation ? The Chinese people are very well informed as to the manner in which Japanese writers and others have labored in/ cessantly to create in America and in Europe false impressions of everything Chinese . Naturally , such unfair propaganda has not served to allay suspicions and remove resentment . The mission of Baron Shibusawa in America was fully reported in China . Numerous Japanese flippancies regarding Chinese technical skill and " the necessity for the employment of Japanese superintendents and foremen " in China produced a very bad impression . And is this strange ? Many of the best judges consider Chinese workmanship and Chinese art distinctly superior to that of Japan . And while the Japanese have shown great skill in military organization , they have nothing that can compare with the great voluntary cooperative companies of Chinese that work thousands of men in the tin mines of the Federated Malay States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooing of American finance for the ultimate undoing of China as " a proposal for an unholy alliance of dollar , despot , and dupe . " Its acceptance by us , they say , would threaten the relegation of the Chinese people to the mean parts of hewers of wood and drawers of water in their own land , when their capacity for leadership in industry is great . The record left in China by the Okuma administration ? whatever may have been the actual intentions of the aged marquis ? was not a good one . The Chinese point to the sharp conflict between Okuma 's words and his acts . " He pledged us peace and friendship , " they say , " and then he struck at the very foundations of our national sovereignty . " Some of the younger men speak of him as " the Japanese Janus . " A Chinese said this of Japan : " She sends her emissaries to the United States to talk to you , Americans , of her great friendship for us and her fatherly interest in our welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we can not hear her because of the noise which she is making in our house with her twenty-one demands . " The appointment of Baron Hayashi , " a substantive ambassador , " to be Japanese minister at Peking awakened very favorable hopes ? they would have been glad to have them expectations ? in China . The baron had won his diplomatic spurs in the Chinese capital . Everything possible was done by Chinese and others to fortify the friendship he expressed towards China . Scarcely had he presented his credentials when these were followed by new demands based upon the act of unwarranted aggression apparently committed , according to Chinese reports , by war-hungry Japanese soldiers at Chengchiatung . Since I returned from the Orient several minor changes have been made in the Japanese legation staff at Peking . In order that Americans may appreciate one of the causes of Japanese diplomatic failure in China , it may be well to reproduce here ( without editing or altering as much as a punctuation mark ) a first-hand Japanese account of how a Japanese official approaches the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , newly appointed counselor of the Japanese Legation in Peking , when about to leave for China , was guest of honor at a banquet given by the Kasumi Club , or the Foreign Office Press Club . In response to a farewell address Mr. Yoshizawa said in part : " China is like an incompetent person whose monetary allowances are limited by the administrator of his property , ' said Mr. Yoshizawa . She has been incompetent to manage her financial affairs in the past and is incompetent now . ' " One is tempted to inquire whether Japan would be competent to manage her financial affairs if foreigners held her customs tariffs down to about three per cent , and tied up other income at will as they did China 's last year . Take hands off China ? and see . The tactful diplomat continued : " There are only two world powers now which can give attention to China in any appreciable degree . They are Japan and the United States . The United States is a rich country and can afford to invest capital in China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . America 's interests in China will grow rapidly . But Japan , for geographical reasons and because of her political and other relations in the past , is in a more convenient position than America to assist China . The responsibility of Japan , therefore , is very great . Japan should treat China as if she were Japan 's own relative . This task requires  | a great deal of patience on the part of Japan . Japan must care for China as a mother cares for her child . It is my idea that we should be patient with China . If she listens to our friendly suggestions , she should be encouraged ; if she does not , she should be chastised as a father punishes his wayward son . I expect to assist Baron Hayashi , my chief , in Peking , with that policy in mind . We should avoid doing things which will only invite the suspicion of the Chinese and foreign nations . ' " The Chinese newspapers , of course , receive such news reports in due course by cable and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discreet " official to the capital of China . Supposing an American official accredited by our government to Japan or by China to Japan should speak of Japan in such impudent , insulting terms , what would inevitably happen ? Would he be persona grata at Tokyo ? Would our government or the government of China overlook such a rank offense against international propriety ? Not likely . A very few Americans appointed to our diplomatic corps have been indiscreet ? although never insulting , as in this case ? and swift and condign has been their punishment , even when the " offense " was more or less technical , and open to reasonable explanation . As a real friend of Japan 's I call the attention of her rulers to these facts . I want to see Japan and China friends as I desire to see America and Japan even closer friends than now . But her government can not expect friendship and confidence when such childishly foolish diplomats run at large unrebuked . A wiser policy , such as was outlined to me in Tokyo , would strengthen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insure her future . Will she not adopt it ? Unless there is a change not only in tone , but in deeds , Japan , with her own hand and pen , has written the brief indicting her policy towards China . Her own acts comprise the evidence in the case . The circumstances surrounding these acts intensify their baleful character and consequences . What must be the sum total of all these cankerous circumstances ? Eating into the sound heart of China , as they have eaten through the years covered by China 's indictment of Japan 's unfriendly course , could there be any effect but one ? Not if the Chinese possessed the patience of Job . The Chinese are , at last , coming into their own . It is much too late for any nation to attempt to stem the flood of Chinese progress . That is the one Star of Hope for China ? she has been misunderstood , her defensive strength underestimated until , at last , Time and the vigorous labors of her youth have tolled the curfew against further aggression or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America never weary of telling of Japan 's marvellous progress during the last few decades . I rejoice to agree with them . But when , after a twelve years ' absence from Peking , I re-entered the ancient walls I did not find the old city . Twelve years had sufficed to build a new Peking , more marvellously changed than our new western cities . I question if the same brief span of years ever witnessed so great improvements in Tokyo . And , most encouraging of all , the change in the awakened progressive spirit of rulers and people was no less marked . In Japan , progress , as we understand it , has been a thing of exotic growth . " More than any Westerner can realize , " says Dr. Sidney L. Gulick , an ardent admirer and eager defender of Japan , in " Evolution of the Japanese , " " the Japanese people have been dependent on governmental initiative from time immemorial . . . . The Occidentalized order now dominant in Japan was adopted , not by the people , but by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In China , the impulse came from below , not from above . The Manchu edicts accepting foreign innovations were compelled by agitation among the Chinese people themselves . The people led , the mandarins merely followed , in China . Not the old government , but the people are building this wonderful new China . And that is one reason why the present situation , while it may and does annoy , does not greatly alarm the Chinese people . I have been surprised at their confidence . They have faith in themselves . They also repose faith in their friends . They will succeed .
