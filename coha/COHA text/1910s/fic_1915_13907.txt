SCENE  --  The main room of a ruined cottage on the outskirts of a small Belgian village . The rear wall has two enormous breaches made by the shells of the artillery . The right wall is partly hidden by a mass of wreckage from the roof , which has caved in leaving a jagged hole through which the sky can be seen . The ceiling slants drunkenly downward toward the right , ending abruptly in a ragged edge of splintered boards and beams which forms a fantastic fretwork against the sky . The floor is littered with all kinds of debris . In the rear wall near the right corner , a window , its panes of glass all broken , with a torn white curtain . No trace of the doorway to the road remains . The larger breach in the rear wall is used as exit and entrance . The left wall , with a door in the middle , is uninjured . Over the door a large black crucifix hangs from a nail . In the center of the room , an overturned table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is beside it . On the right of the table a smashed armchair . The time is about sundown on a September day . Through the breaches in the wall a dark green vista of rolling fields can be seen . Where they meet the horizon they are already shimmering in the golden dust of the sunset . Muffled and far-off , the booming of distant cannon reverberates slowly over the fields . The sound of shuffling footsteps is heard from the road before the cottage and a great hulking old man of sixty-five or so appears at the larger breach in the rear wall . He is dressed in the usual peasant fashion and wears wooden sabots on his feet . He is bent under some burden which , as he enters the room , is seen to be the body of a young man dressed in the uniform of a Belgian infantryman . He lays the body down carefully in a cleared space between the table and the left wall , pillowing the soldier 's head upon his knapsack . The body lies with its feet toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form , his attitude one of abject despair . A heavy sob shakes his round shoulders . He murmurs brokenly : " Charles ! My little one ! " ; then turns abruptly and stumbles to the middle of the room where he mechanically rights the overturned table . He sits down on the chair , and stares at the ruins about him with an expression of dazed bewilderment on his broad face , his round , child-like eyes wandering dully from one object to another . His gaze finally rests on the smashed armchair on the other side of the table , and suddenly overcome by a flood of anguished horror , he hides his face in his hands , rocking from side to side on his chair , moaning to himself like a wounded animal . The slight black-robed figure of a priest appears on the road outside . He casts a quick glance into the room and , seeing the bowed figure on the chair quickly picks his way to the peasant 's side . The priest is old , white-haired , with a kindly , spiritual face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( not hearing him ) God , oh God ! THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  ( laying a thin white hand compassionately on Rougon 's broad back ) There , there , my son ! It is the will of God . ROUGON  --  ( startled by the sound of a voice , jumps up from his chair ) Eh ? ( stares at the priest with dazed eyes ) THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  ( with a sad smile ) Oh , come now , it is n't possible that you 've forgotten me . ROUGON  --  ( snatching off his cap respectfully ) Pardon , Father . I was  --  I did n't know  --  you see  --  all this  --  THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  ( gently ) I have heard of your loss . I understand . ROUGON  --  But take the chair , Father . ( bitterly ) I am lucky to have it left to offer you . THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  ( sitting down ) You must not brood over your misfortunes . Many , a great many , have suffered even more than you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at such a dreadful time as this , and pray to God for strength . We must all bow ourselves before His will . p. 4 ROUGON  --  His will ? Ha ! No , the good God would not punish me so ,  --  I , who have harmed no one . ( furiously ) It is all these cursed Pruss  --  THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  Ssshh ! ( after a pause ) Such thoughts may rest in the heart , but to let them rise to the lips is hardly wise  --  now . ROUGON  --  What matter if they should hear ? I am finished , me ! They can do no more but kill me . ( He sits on the edge of the table . A heavy sob shakes his bowed shoulders . ) THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  ( after a pause during which he gazes sadly at the face of the dead young soldier ) You must not mourn his loss so bitterly . He has given his life for his country . He is at rest with God . You should feel proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is  --  at rest  --  in heaven . And , look you , Father , you remember , this was the day  --  today he was to have been married . THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  ( in accents of deep grief ) True , true , I had forgotten . Poor boy , poor boy  --  and poor Louise ! ROUGON  --  And my poor old woman  --  Ah , good God , what have we done ? All this  --  in one day ! p. 5 THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  Your wife  --  she does n't know ? ROUGON  --  No . This morning , look you , I sent her away . It was Charles who came to me this morning  --  in his new uniform  --  he who lies there so still now  --  he whom they have murdered , those cursed Prussians ! THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  Ssshh ! Would you bring more misfortune upon yourself ? ROUGON  --  ( springing to his feet in a frenzy ) Ah , how I would love to slaughter them , to grind my heel in their fat faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calm yourself , for the love of heaven , my good Rougon ! Will it improve matters , think you , to have you , too , shot ? Do not forget your poor old wife . You must be careful for her sake , if for nothing else . ROUGON  --  ( sullenly slouching back to his seat on the table ) It is hard , name of a dog , it is hard . I feel like a coward , me , to stand by and do nothing . THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  ( in low tones ) Be comforted . The hour of retribution will yet strike . The end is not yet . Your son Charles will be avenged . ROUGON  --  ( shaking his head doubtfully ) There are so many . p. 6 THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  But you were telling me about your wife . You sent her away this morning ? ROUGON  --  If the good God so pleases she is in Brussels by now . For , look you , Charles came to me this morning . " My father " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here today . I have warned the family of Louise and she is to flee with them to Brussels . I have arranged that Mother should go with them ; and you , too , my father . " " But no , " I said , " It is right for your mother . She shall go . As you say , it will be no place for women if there be fighting . But me , no , I shall stay . " " Mind you , then , Father , no shooting ! " Charles said as he kissed me good-bye and ran to join the regiment on the village place , " or they will shoot you like a dog " . THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  You see ! Your son gave you the best advice . Remember you are not a soldier . ROUGON  --  ( proudly ) If I were not too old I should have been in a uniform this long time gone . Too old ! The fools ! As if I could not shoot straighter than all these boys ! THE VILLAGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor Rougon . Someone must gather in the harvest if we are not all to starve . ROUGON  --  ( fiercely ) The harvest ? What is there left ? First it is the French who take away my two fine horses that I have saved up every centime two years to buy  --  and leave me a scrap of paper ; then  --  p. 7 THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  The French are our friends ; in due time you shall be paid . ROUGON  --  Bah , promises ! THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  ( earnestly ) At a time like this all must bear their share of sacrifice . ROUGON  --  All who wanted war , yes ; but we who desired nothing more than to be left in peace to till our fields ? Look you , my Father , why should we be robbed and plundered and our homes blown apart by their accursed cannon ? THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  ( shaking his head , sadly ) God knows . Our poor country is a lamb among wolves . ROUGON  --  ( raising his voice excitedly ) The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where it struck ? THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  No . ROUGON  --  Out there  --  on my barn  --  setting it in flames  --  killing my two cows one of which I was to have given Charles , with half of my farm , as a wedding present  --  burning up all my hay I had gathered for the winter . ( stamping his foot in his rage ) Ah , those dirty beasts ! THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  Ssshh ! They are all around . p. 8 ROUGON  --  And then , look you , the cavalry ride over my fields trampling my grain beneath their horses , the artillery wheels tear up the earth , the cannon blow my home to pieces  --  as you see . ( bitterly ) Harvest ? There is nothing left to harvest but dirt and stones ! THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  ( to change the subject which is rapidly infuriating the old man ) You may well give thanks to the good God that your wife is safe in Brussels . ROUGON  --  They started early this morning , as I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brussels . She is safe , God be thanked . ( with a grief-stricken glance at the body of his son ) But when she knows  --  and Louise who also loved him so  --  Oh , my God ! ( He chokes back a sob . ) THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  God give them strength to bear it . ROUGON  --  ( indicating his son ) He wanted me to go with them . He was afraid I would do something rash if I stayed . But I have been calm . But , name of a dog , it has been hard  --  when I saw them trampling my wheat  --  those pigs  --  when I saw the ashes which had been my barn  --  and this house , as you see , where I had lived so many years  --  this finger itched to press the trigger and send at least one to hell for payment . p. 9 THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  My son , my son ! ROUGON  --  Your pardon , my Father . Had it not been for the promise I had given Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have it hidden in there ( he indicates with a nod of his head the room on the left ) and  --  THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  ( casting an apprehensive glance toward the street ) Ssshh ! Be careful what you say in so loud a tone . Their soldiers are everywhere . But where were you when all this fighting was taking place ? ROUGON  --  I was hiding in the well . I had placed a board across , on which I could stand and see what took place through the chinks in the stones . I wanted to see  --  him . THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  See  --  Charles ? How could  --  ROUGON  --  His part of the regiment was behind the wall in the orchard not one hundred meters away . I could watch him clearly . THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  ( to himself , half-aloud ) Poor man ! ROUGON  --  At first it was all right . Their infantry came up so close to each other that not even a child could have missed them . Bang ! and they were toppled over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I laughed . I thought it was all finished . I could see Charles laughing and talking with his comrades  --  and then  --  ( He stops , shaking his head despondently. ) p. 10 THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  And then ? ROUGON  --  One of their devilish flying machines which look like the great birds flew overhead , far-up . All shot at it but it was too far away . It flew back to them , and a minute later , look you , I saw white puffs of smoke on all the hills over to the west ; then bang ! crash ! I could not hear ; my ears were cracked with the din . There was dust , and falling walls , and my barn blazing . Ah , those accursed cannon ! I climbed out of the well and ran to the barn . THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  In the midst of all those bursting shells ? ROUGON  --  I trembled with rage . I had no fear of their cannon . I remembered only the cow , the pretty little cow , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . Not all the fire-engines in Belgium could have saved it . I ran back to the well . Ssszzz ! went the bullets all round . As I was climbing over I was stunned by a terrible crash . The roof of this house tumbled in  --  as you see . THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  And you remained in the well all during the battle ? ROUGON  --  Yes  --  until I saw Charles fall . He was just aiming his rifle over the wall when I saw him throw up his hands , spin around like a top , and fall on his face . I ran down and carried him back on my shoulders to the well  --  but it was too late . He was dead . ( He stops abruptly , choking back a sob ) p. 11 THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  ( after a pause ) Requiescat in pace . His life was ever a happy one . He never knew the cares and worries that come with the years and the ceaseless struggle for bread . He loved and was loved . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it not better after all  --  as it is ? ( Rougon does not answer . ) Can you not console yourself with that thought ? ROUGON  --  Perhaps . Who knows ? But , look you , it is hard for me  --  and for Louise  --  and most of all for his mother whose baby he was . THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  You all loved him , did everything in your power to make him happy . You have nothing with which to reproach yourselves . ROUGON  --  But now  --  what shall I do ? Look you , it was for him we worked and saved , his mother and I ; that he might never have to know , as we had known , what it is to be poor and hungry . ( despondently ) And now  --  we are old  --  what use to work ? There is nothing left but death . THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  You have each other . ROUGON  --  Yes , we have each other . Were it not for the thought of my poor Margot I had let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VILLAGE PRIEST  --  ( sternly ) I do not like to hear you talk in that manner . You must realize well , that in its time of stress , your country has need of you ; as much need of you as of her soldiers . You must not be rash . You must live and help and bear your part of her burden as best you can . It is your duty . ROUGON  --  Yes , yes , I well know it ; but  --  THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  Above all , you have to exercise control over your hasty temper . You must realize that you will best serve your country and revenge your personal wrongs by living and helping , not by willfully seeking death . You must remember you are a civilian and , according to the rules of war , you have no right to fight . Your part lies elsewhere . Let others shoot the guns . ROUGON  --  ( disgustedly ) Bah ! The children they have as soldiers can not shoot . With my little rifle in there I could pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like my poor Charles . ( scornfully ) Yet they tell me I am too old to enlist ! Dolts ! THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  ( rising and laying his hand on Rougon 's back  --  with solemn earnestness ) My son , before I leave , I want you to swear to me before the God who watches over us , that you will remember what I have said and not allow your temper to force you to violence . p. 13 ROUGON  --  ( sullenly ) I promise . I swear it . THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  ( patting him on the back ) There , now you are sensible , more like yourself . ( He stands looking down at Charles . ) I would advise you as to the burial of Charles . ( Rougon groans . ) Let it be done as secretly as possible . Let us avoid all provocation , and on their heads be it if misfortune happens . Perhaps tonight would be best . ROUGON  --  Ah , no , no , no ! Please , my Father , not yet ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house he was born in , with me . THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  So be it . Tomorrow night , then . You will let me know what time you wish it to be . ROUGON  --  Very well , my Father . THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  And now I must go ; but first let us kneel down and humbly offer up a prayer for the repose of his soul . ( They kneel down beside the dead body . The priest commences to intone a prayer in which the words " Almighty God , " " Merciful , " " Infinite justice , " " Infinite love , " " Infinite pity , " " Thy son Jesus , " " We , Thy children , " " Praise Thy infinite goodness , " stand out from the general mumble of sing-song sentences . Perhaps a sense of the crushing irony of this futile prayer penetrates the sorrow-numbed brain of Rougon and proves the last straw which breaks down his self-control ; for he interrupts the droning supplications of the priest with a groan of agony , throws himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Charles , Charles , my little one ! Oh , why did not God take me instead ! " ) p. 14 THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  ( after a pause  --  wiping the tears from his eyes with his large handkerchief ) Come , come , it is hard , I know , but you must bear it like a man . God 's will be done ! He , too , had a Son who died for others . Pray to Him and He will comfort you in your affliction . ROUGON  --  ( placing his hand gently on his son 's face ) Cold ! Cold ! He who was so alive and smiling only this morning . ( A step is heard on the road outside . The two get hastily to their feet as a young man in the grey uniform of a German captain of infantry appears at one of the gaps of the wall . ) A GERMAN CAPTAIN OF INFANTRY  --  ( entering and turning to the priest ) Are you the  --  ( seeing the body on the floor ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) What is your wish ? A GERMAN CAPTAIN OF INFANTRY  --  ( twirling his blond mustache fiercely to hide his embarrassment ) Again , I ask pardon . I meant no disrespect . ( Taking off his helmet impressively  --  he is a very young captain . ) I honor the brave dead on whichever side they fall . p. 15 THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  ( indicating Rougon who has slunk off to the other side of the table and is controlling his hatred and rage with very apparent effort ) It is his son . A GERMAN CAPTAIN OF INFANTRY  --  Ah ! Too bad ! The fortunes of war . Today , him ; tomorrow , me , perhaps . Are you the cur of the village ? THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  I am . A GERMAN CAPTAIN OF INFANTRY  --  I have been seeking you ever since we occupied the place . THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  I returned but a short time ago from Brussels where I had been called to make my report to the Bishop . I knew nothing of the fighting here or I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many , perhaps , who died needing me . But what is it you wish ? A GERMAN CAPTAIN OF INFANTRY  --  I was sent by the colonel to find you and deliver his orders . There seems to be no one of civil authority left in the village  --  else I should not intrude upon you . THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  I am listening . A GERMAN CAPTAIN OF INFANTRY  --  ( oratorically ) It is the colonel 's wish that you warn the inhabitants against committing any violence against our soldiers . Civilians caught with arms will be immediately shot . ( The priest casts a significant glance at Rougon who scowls and mutters to himself . ) Is that clear ? p. 16 THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  Quite . A GERMAN CAPTAIN OF INFANTRY  --  On the other hand all we demand of you will be paid for in cash . Let all your parishioners return to their work without fear of molestation . We make no war upon the helpless . ( with complacent pride ) I hope I make my meaning clear . I flatter myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( with cold politeness ) You speak it very well , Monsieur . You may tell your colonel that I will do all in my power to impress his words upon the minds of my people  --  not that I respect his orders or admit his right to give them to a man of peace , but because I have the welfare of my people at heart . A GERMAN CAPTAIN OF INFANTRY  --  Good . I will tell him . And now I will say " au revoir " for I , too , have my duties to perform . We march from here immediately . THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  ( significantly ) Adieu . ( The Captain goes out . ) ROUGON  --  ( raging ) Dog of a Prussian ! THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  Silence ! Are you a fool ? ( While he is speaking an awkward peasant boy of about fifteen with a broad face appears at the breech in the rear wall . His clothes are mud-stained and ragged and he is trembling with fear . He breathes in great shuddering gasps . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has dried in reddish-brown streaks. ) p. 17 ROUGON  --  ( hears the noise ) What 's that ? ( They both turn around and see the boy . ) THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  Why , it 's Jean ! Whatever are you doing skulking around like that ? JEAN  --  ( stopping uneasily as if he intended to run away again ) Nothing , nothing . THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  Come over here . ( Jean does not move but stares at him with frightened eyes . ) Do n't you hear me speaking to you ? What is the matter with you ? JEAN  --  ( faintly ) I am afraid . THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  Of me ? Come , this is ridiculous . JEAN  --  ( his lips trembling ) I am afraid  --  of them . Everything  --  blows up . ROUGON  --  Come to the good father when he speaks to you , stupid dolt ! Or I shall find a good strong stick and  --  THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  Hush , you are only frightening him . Come to me , Jean , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest who puts an arm about his shoulders . ) Why , you 're trembling like a leaf ! Did the battle frighten you ? p. 18 JEAN  --  No , no , no ! I do n't know . ROUGON  --  ( contemptuously ) The battle ? He was never near the fighting . It was bad enough for we others without having this half-witted calf around . So we sent him away with the women this morning . ( to Jean ) Answer me , you , how is it you are back here ? JEAN  --  ( trembling ) I do n't know . ROUGON  --  ( roughly ) Name of a dog , what do you know ? Did we send you away with the women this morning or did n't we ? JEAN  --  ( uncertainly ) Yes  --  I went away  --  this morning . THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  Hush , Rougon , you are only frightening the poor fellow . Jean , listen to me and stop trembling . I shall not let anyone hurt you . I have always been your good friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are my friend . THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  Of course I am ; and while I am around there is nothing you need fear . Come now , tell me like a good lad ; you went away with the others this morning , did n't you ? JEAN  --  Yes , Father . p. 19 THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  Then how do you happen to be here now ? Why did you return to the village ? Your clothes are in a shocking state . Where have you been hiding and how did you get that cut on your forehead ? JEAN  --  ( feeling the cut on his forehead with a dazed air ) It hurts . THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  You will come home with me presently and we will wash that nasty cut and wrap it up in a nice clean bandage . Then you may be sure you will no longer feel any hurt at all . But first tell me  --  JEAN  --  I do n't know . I ran and ran  --  and I came here . THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  But something must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , what was it ? JEAN  --  ( vaguely ) We left here and walked a long , long ways . Some rode in wagons but I was walking . ROUGON  --  And did you see Mother Rougon there , and Louise ? JEAN  --  ( in a strange tone  --  with a shudder ) Yes , I saw them , I saw them . ( Rougon gives a grunt of satisfaction . ) THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  Go on , my son , tell us what happened next . p. 20 JEAN  --  We could hear shots . We hurried faster . The horses galloped . The women commenced to scream and cry . Always the firing was louder . We did n't see any soldiers for a long time . Then we came upon lots of bodies  --  men from our army and others dressed in grey . ROUGON  --  ( in growing alarm ) Name of a dog , why did n't you turn back , eh ? JEAN  --  ( vaguely ) I do n't know . ( He drones on in his expressionless voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They wanted us to hurry up and get to Brussels . We beat the horses . The hills were covered with white spots like ,  --  like daisies ; and they floated ' way up in the air . ( He makes a queer awkward gesture upward . ) ROUGON  --  Idiot ! What is all this foolish talk ? THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  ( gently ) It was the smoke from the guns you saw , my child . JEAN  --  ( very slowly  --  trying his best to imitate the exact sound ) Boom ! Boom ! Boom ! I could n't hear what anyone was saying . ( He pauses . ) ROUGON  --  Why do you stop , stupid ? Go on , go on , or  --  ( He shakes his clenched fist at the boy. ) p. 21 THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  Silence , Rougon ! Give the poor lad a chance . JEAN  --  ( in flat , monotonous tones ) Something blew up in a field by the road and threw dirt and stones on us . The horses were afraid . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hill . Lots of the soldiers in our army were there hiding in a long ditch . They shouted for us to run away . Then  --  then  --  then  --  THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  ( anxiously ) Yes ? ( Rougon stands tensely with averted face as if afraid to listen . ) JEAN  --  ( throwing both his arms into the air with a wild gesture ) Then everything around blew up . ( in flat tones ) Something hit me on the head . I laid down for a while . When I got up I could n't see any of the rest . There were bodies all around . I saw Mother Rougon  --  THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  ( clinging to a last shred of hope ) Alive and unharmed ? ( But Rougon has guessed the worst and stands as if in a stupor , clenching and unclenching his big red hands , his features working convulsively . ) JEAN  --  She was lying on the ground . She had a big hole here ( pointing to his chest ) and blood all over  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROUGON  --  ( dully ) Dead ! She , too ! JEAN  --  And Louise had a hole in her head , here ( pointing to his forehead ) and  --  THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  ( distracted with horror ) Enough ! Stop ! We have heard all we care to , do you hear ? JEAN  --  So I ran , and ran , and ran , and ran , and ran . ( His words die away into a murmur  --  He stares straight before him like one in a trance . ) THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  Merciful God , have pity ! ROUGON  --  ( slowly  --  as if the meaning of Jean 's words were just commencing to dawn on him ) So  --  they are gone , too  --  the old woman  --  and Louise  --  ( licks his lips with his dry tongue ) Everything is gone . ( There is a long silence . The priest dabs with his big handkerchief at the tears which are welling into his eyes . Jean wanders over to the breach in the wall and stands looking down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jean darts back into the room . ) JEAN  --  ( waving his arms , cries in terrified tones ) They are coming . They are coming this way ! ( He runs to the right corner of the room and crouches there trembling , seeking to hide himself in the fallen ruins. ) p. 23 ROUGON  --  So  --  they are coming ? ( He strides resolutely across the room and enters the room on left . ) THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  ( alarmed by the expression on Rougon 's face ) Rougon ! Rougon ! What are you going to do ? ( He receives no answer . A moment later Rougon re-enters the room carrying a long-barrelled rifle . ) THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  ( seizing him by the arm ) No , no , I beseech you ! ROUGON  --  ( roughly throwing the priest aside ) Let me alone ! ( He half-kneels beside one of the breeches in the wall  --  then speaks in a voice of deadly calmness . ) They will not pass here . They are going to turn off at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however . ( The rhythmic tramp of the marching troops can be faintly heard . ) THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  ( in agony ) In the name of God I implore you  --  ROUGON  --  Bah , God ! ( He takes careful aim and fires . ) That for Margot ! ( loads and fires again ) That for Louise ! ( Cries of rage and running footsteps are heard . Rougon is reloading his rifle when the Captain and four German privates rush in . Rougon struggles but is disarmed and forced back to the wall on left . He stands proudly , calmly awaiting his fate . One of the soldiers seizes the priest. ) p. 24 THE SOLDIER  --  ( to the Captain ) Was mit dem Priester ? ROUGON  --  ( to the Captain ) The good father did nothing . He but did his best to hold my arm and stop me . It is I alone who did the shooting , Dog of a Prussian ! A GERMAN CAPTAIN OF INFANTRY  --  Is this true , priest ? THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  not for your sakes , but for his own . A GERMAN CAPTAIN OF INFANTRY  --  ( to the soldier ) Las den Priester gehen ! ( The soldier releases the priest . The Captain turns to Rougon . ) If you have a prayer to say , be quick ! ( The four soldiers line up in front of Rougon and face him across the body of Charles . ) ROUGON  --  ( with angry scorn ) I want no prayers ! THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  Rougon ! ROUGON  --  ( furiously ) To hell with your prayers ! THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  ( supplicatingly ) Make your peace with God , my son ! p. 25 ROUGON  --  ( spitting on the floor , fiercely ) That for your God who allows such things to happen ! ( to the Captain ) I am ready , pig ! A GERMAN CAPTAIN OF INFANTRY  --  ( to the soldiers ) Gewehr ! Heraus ! ( The soldiers take aim . ) THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  May God have mercy on  --  A GERMAN CAPTAIN OF INFANTRY  --  Feuer ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , quivers for a moment , is still . The soldiers file out to the road . The Captain turns to the horrified priest . ) A GERMAN CAPTAIN OF INFANTRY  --  ( shrugging his shoulders ) It is the law . ( He follows the soldiers . ) THE VILLAGE PRIEST  --  ( looking down with infinite compassion at the still bodies of father and son ) Alas , the laws of men ! ( The sun has set . The twilight is fading grayly into night . From the heap of wreckage in the right corner comes the sound of stifled weeping. )
