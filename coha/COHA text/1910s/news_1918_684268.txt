txt UNITY IN 1898 AND 1918 . Republicans Now Oppose the President as Democrats Did Then . To the Editor of The New York Times : In reply to Mr. Augustus Thomas 's ' attempt to explain the President 's appeal for the election of a Democratic Congress , ? may I quote the following from a lettet I have just received from an eminent person who ought to know something about this question : In the Spanish war the Democratic leaders were so hostile Wet it was exceedingly hard to get the treaty-of peace confirmed by the necessary majority . In the earns way In the civil war , the Democrats made their campaign on the issue that the war was a failure , but In this war President Wilson at last took the position that I had for two years been urging that we take . The Republicans have furnished the greater percentage of support In Congress for the war , and the Republican leaders have been'those who have given the leadership in the demand for putting war through to the end . Senator Lodge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson . To support the Party to which these Republican leaders belong will be to support the party which is . most resolute and most effective In standing for the war . The Democratic Party was Copperhead in ' 64 , " " In ' 98 ; and , therefore , Lincoln and typified the nationalist Idea as against their opponents . Rut the Republican Party now is more American prewar than Wilson and his party combined . THEODORE ROOSEVELT . Also , may I recall to those who remember the facts and inform those who do not know that previous to the Congressional election in 1898 upward of fifteen State Democratic Conventions had in their platforms definite declarations that the United States should not take any territory from Spain and that such at that time was the accepted prograin of the National Democratic . Party . If a Democratic Congress had been elected in November , 1898 , it is quite true that the Spanish Commissioners at the peace table would have had an effective argument to prevent our securing the Philippines . Does not this fact , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conveniently Ignore , sufficiently explain and justify the Presidential appeal of 1898 ? And is not the situation today the exact opposite ? Indeed , is it not unique , not only in the history of the United States but in the history of almost every other country ? The minority and opposition party today is one whose success can not possibly encourage the enemy or fail to hearten the Allies and to stiffen their demands , RICHARD BARRY . New York , Nov. 1 , 1918 . In other words , the Democrats in 1898 declared their opposition to the war policies of President , just as Colonel Roosevelt and Senator Lodge have now declared , in the name of the Republican Party , opposition to the war , policies of President Wilson . Mr. appealed to the country to support him against the opposition , and the country responded . Mr. Wilson makes a similar appeal , and the Republicans cry out that he has done an unheard-of thing . Possibly the country may be moved to give him the support he asks for , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
