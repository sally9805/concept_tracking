txt PITTSBURGH , July 22 . ? " The Chairman of this convention has been given authority to direct its deliberations and preserve order . The gentleman from Pennsylvania will take his seat . The police will remove him from that if ha does not sit down . Sit down , Sinn was in something like these words that Senator Elihu Root , Chairman of the Republican Convention at Chicago , told William Flinn , the new Bull Moose boss of Pennsylvania , that he had to behave himself , and ever since William has been as gentle as lambkin ever was in a political meadow ; not because William is afraid of Root or any other man , but because ho is prudent . What happened at Oyster Bay to-day nobody here knows  --  it is doubtful that Flinn himself knows  --  but whatever It wee it was important at least from the high moral point of view in politics . ? ? ? It may be said without contradiction that Flinn agrees with Dr. Lyman Abbott and Col. Roosevelt ( see The Outlook , July 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiate , to suggest general principles , and to permit the delegates of a genuine popular convention to deliberate and to determine upon the application of these principles . " Any boss would agree to that , and the people know hat such Is the underlying Principle of the Bull Moose Party . William Flinn is one of the political leaders , however , who keeps his eye on local conditions and thinketh in his heart that it is really almost as important for the Republicans to carry Pennsylvania in November for the State ticket as it is for Col. Roosevelt to secure the Electoral vote of this State . He has been saying that he " was out of it , " but the fact that he violated the Sabbath Day by traveling to Oyster BaY for conference and instructions shows that he Is still very much in it . At least Iv : has sundry friends here who are very much concerned just now about the question of regularity . The State Republicaif ticket is Flinn 's ticket . If there is a break on the question of regularity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morals and according to wellestablished precedent . if not according to the letter of the law , ( which . indeed . is silent , ) the regular Republicans do not see how regularity can be pleaded effectively against the abandonment of the regular Republican ticket for State and local offices . Roosevelt carried the State at the primary election by a large majority , and most of the Republicans named in this State were Roosevelt partisans . The convention at Chicago nominated Taft , and it is held by the Taft people that the Electors in Pennsylvania are bound to vote for him . This is denied by the . Bull Moose Party . The Electors are not , bound by law . They could vote for Wilson if they chose to do so , or for Debs or any other candidate for President : but if they should do so their conduct would shock the civilized sense of the country , if there be any of It left to be shocked . Nominated as Republicans , they would be false to their party and false to themselves should they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much would doubtless be conceded by them . Mr. Roosevelt is the candidate of another party . He has cut loose from the Republican Party , in so many words , and can be voted for by no Elector who ' would retain his status as a Republican . State Chairman Wasson is to meet the , / Chairmen of the central counties of Pennsylvania at Harrisburg on Thursday to conclude his plans for the Presidential campaign . He has suggested that the Electors nominated at the primary run on the Taft ticket and on the Roosevelt ticket also . Roosevelt will not permit such a thing to be done . He will take . the whole cheese or none . That is why Flinn went to Oyster Bay to see him about it , and to talk it over , and that Is why everybody an both sides is nervous and unsettled . As to Just exactly where anybody or anything is at , there is no way that the Republican Electors already nominated can be thrown off the regular ticket , so far as the sharp politicians and legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way by which they can be compelled ; to vote for Mr. Taft , the regular Repub- ; lican candidate for President . It could not be done by force , of course , and it can not be done by law . It can very well be understood that if these Electors should vote against the regular Republican candidate for President they would be canonized by The Outlook as possessing the right sort of moral fibre ; but that is not what William Flinn and his. ? coadjutors are after . They are working for results much nearer home , for the success of the regular Republican ticket ' in State matters , and with them it Is a question of whether it would not be ! better to cast out one of their members ' Into purgatory than to have the whole , party go to Gehenna or wherever it is going . This - is the way it looks just now . The situation may be changed somewhat by what happened at Oyster Bay to-day . There is a suspicion , that is growing steadily , that Mr. Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable prudence in intimate political matters would justify them in granting . In the meantime the Democrats of Pennsylvania are much encouraged by the present conditions . Why not make the Keystone State unanimous for Wilson ? Thus the plague would rest equally on both Republican houses : " and the Star-Spangled Banner "  --  and so on . J. C. H.
