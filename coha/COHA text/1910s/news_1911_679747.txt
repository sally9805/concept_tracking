txt The cost of the schools of New York is necessarily very great Few of our readers who have not given special study to the subject realize how large it is relatively and positively . Last year over 29,000,000 was appropriated . This was by far the largest single appropriation for administrative ' use and was equal to the amount paid for the Police Department , the Fire Department , and the Departments of Health , Charities , and Docks , all five combined . The only thing we spent more money on than on the schools was the public debt , which represents the vast permanent investments of the corporation . This year the tentative budget , the totals of which were published in THE TMES yesterday morning , allows to the Board of Education $7,500,000 more than last year , an increase of about one-fourth . It Is not surprising that the Board of Estimate should scan with the closest scrutiny the uses to be made of this enormous amount of the taxpayers ' money . They will , of course , give proper attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prof. FlAxim of Harvard which has been appointed to assist in the study of all school conditions . it is possible , however , that the work of . this committee may well be too comprehensive and extensive to permit the application of its results , except gradually and through a long period of time . We are ourselves convinced that there are radical changes required in the whole spool system to make it give the greatest good to the greatest number , and especially to the very great number whose needs are the most pressing . But such a change can not be made rapidly and it is probable that no very considerable part of it could be effected in time to be embraced in the provisions of the current budget Wherever it Is practicable , that should be done , but in the meanwhile , it is reasonable that the system as a whole should be provided for , keeping in view the influence on changes ' in the future . One exceedingly important element should noon any ease be lost sightof , 49,02ttat ; 1 , S , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' For example , it , is'stated that , the , average number of pupils in the High School , classes is a little over twenty-seven , while many classes in the elementary schools run above fifty . This ' does not mean simply that the latter get only one-half the benefit to be had ' by the former ; the discrepancy Is very much more than that . The result is a great loss to the community and a cruel wrong to the pupils most ? needing schooling . It has been the aim of the Board of Education , as we understand it , to provide enough teachers to prevent an attendance of over fifty in any class . That is far too high a maximum , but surely the hoard should , if possible , not be forced to exceed it . The problem of distribution is , however , a trying one . At first glance it would ' seem that the maximum of fifty , or even forty , could be maintained by transferring the excess of pupils from large to smaller classes . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reach of the pupils in the large classes . It may often happen , also , that in the schools where the large classes occur I there are not enough teachers and , pert haps , not enough rooms to permit reducing - the size and increasing the number of classes . These conditions are found in this city more frequently because of the rapid movement of pop , ulation . The movement may be one of mere increase , in which case the solution is more schools and teachers , which is simple but necessarily costly . Or it may be that the movement is one of migration and will crowd certain schools while draining others . It has been suggested that the number of teachers required might fairly be determined by fixing , say , forty as the normal size of a. class and then dividing the number of pupils in each grade by forty . But the matter is by no means so simple Rs that . It may fairly be assumed that the present administration , and particularly the Superintendent and his associates , are doing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their considered recommendations are entitled to respect unless specifically shown to be capable of sound amendment This does not at all involve the concession that the entire system does not need very careful revision . It does , and it is heartily to be hoped that the labors of Dr. HA committee may contribute to that result
