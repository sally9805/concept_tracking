AM not writing this paper to glorify advertising . It does n't need it , and I am not sure that it deserves it , although it has made so many fortunes that we have given up trying to count them . Forty years ago a daily newspaper was supported by its subscribers , advertising yielding about thirty-five per cent . of the total receipts ; recently , in the case of a few papers , it has yielded as high as ninety per cent. , and the revenue from subscriptions is almost negligible ; so it is evident that advertising and fortunes are related in the public mind . Now what is the factor in advertising which creates wealth ? Sometimes it is the inherent merit of the thing advertised ; sometimes it is a combination of persistence and pluck ; but in many cases it is merely an understanding of human nature . The advertiser who takes account of the hopes and fears of the public is operating on a system which is almost certain to succeed . It seems to me that valuable lessons may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if at times I speak against advertising , I hope the reader will not misunderstand me . For I believe in advertising ; I glory in advertising ; I love it as Peary loves the North Pole . But the frozen fact about both advertising and the North Pole is that many die in the process of arriving , i and it is useless to invite your friends to make the trip unless you study the conditions , plan the best route , and see that they are properly dressed for the journey . The enthusiast is apt to make two mistakes . The first is to believe that advertising is a weapon of unqualified goodness ; in other words , that all advertising , like all Kentucky whisky , is good ! Some men will claim that the worst advertising is better than none . And so advertising , per se , being always a good thing , he makes his second mistake by claiming that you ca n't have too much of it . If a little advertising is good , twice as ' much is better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and walk before he runs . There are many firms who can advantageously spend a small sum , but not a large one . It is the part of safety to make haste slowly . I was so fortunate as to he able to devote twenty years of my life to trying to solve advertising problems . Some of these were explained in a little book . Imagination in Business , which aimed to prove that the use of imagination was the first essential in advertising . I should like now to go one step farther and say that the second essential is to understand human nature . I look back on the experiences of those twenty years and am amazed to see how inevitably the whole business was intertwined with human nature . My customers included- the halt , the lame , and the blind ; gentlemen with cold hands and cold feet ; men who had tried advertising and found it a failure ; and men with conditions that advertising could n't reach . Along with these came a different class : ? men who had made fortunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladder ; and men who had tried advertising , salted down the profit , and now wanted new methods of publicity manufactured while you wait . It was a mighty interesting mix-up ! One thing was evident : for most of this hungry horde plain advertising would not do . It was my job to find a way of whipping the advertising devil round the stump . I found so many ways that it seemed to me finally as if plain advertising ought never to be plain . It was so interwoven with the complexities of human nature that the proper study for the advertiser was not newspapers and magazines , but man . And that is what I want to emphasize here . I want to urge that the last step needed to make advertising as safe as Government bonds is to harness it to some one of the motives , the instincts , the weaknesses , the passions , prejudices , hopes , or fears of mankind , and then let human nature do the work for you . I want to show that advertising , to be successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor work-a-day world how much has come out of a knowledge of human nature ! Take away from Abraham Lincoln his insight into human nature and you would alter the whole course of history . It was n't his menagerie that made P. T. Barnum the foremost showman of his time ; it was his knowledge of human nature . The patent-medicine man does n't merely sell medicine ; he gambles on the hopes and fears of mankind . Take this away and leave him only his medicine , and his profits would dwindle into insignificance . Even the pickpocket lives on his knowledge of human nature . He knows that the whole secret of his business is inattention , and he finds it in a crowd . Then he wants one supreme moment of misdirection of attention , and to get it he steps on your foot . That is all he needs , and your watch is his . IF I were asked to name the qualities that enter into good advertising , I should say , first , imagination ; second , knowledge of human nature ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somewhere ( and this seems to be a proper place ) I want to say a word to the business houses that employ an advertising - man . There are only two things to do to an advertising-mandevelop him or fire him ! Try developing first . Give him a free hand ! Remember that your progress depends much on him ! Help him to grow ! Tell him that you look to him for ideas . Then in a short time , if he does n't show results , drop him ! There 's no half-way ground in this matter , for an advertising-man who can not be developed by power and responsibility is a drag on the wheels . But when he has studied your business with some success , when he has introduced a Few ideas that have commercial value , when he begins to reckon with human nature for your profit , then remember that he has become an intellectual pgrtner in the business , and ought to be treated accordingly . He is a creator ; and Oliver Wendell Holmes , a profound student of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are hand-forged by Almighty God , while the rest of the world is merely stamped out by machinery . Do n't talk hours or salary to such a man ! Let him fix his own salary ; if it 's a high one , so much the better ! He must work all the harder to earn it . I knew a firm once who employed such a man . He always decided his own salary , raising it or lowering it each year as he felt his work of the past twelve months warranted . The head of the house never questioned that salary , although he was the closest buyer that I ever saw . I asked him once why he let his advertising - man fix his own salary . He looked at me somewhat contemptuously for a moment . Then he said , " I calculate to buy everything in my line of trade a little lower than any other living man ! Beating down prices is my business , and I yield to no man on it . But do me the credit to admit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the price of brains ! " That man realized in a groping sort of way that he was buying something more than a knowledge of newspapers and type display , more even than new ideas . He was buying something whose quality was absolutely dependent on the mental attitude of the seller . He was buying enthusiasm , and that is almost as unpurchasable as instinct or love . He was " developing " his employee , and incidentally getting the largest returns . To come back to the study of human nature , there is a verse in Kipling that I often recall : There is no more fascinating occupation , and none more profitable , than the study of the human " herd instinct , " or , as some writers call it , the group mind . Let me take time for one illustration ? although its connection with advertising is a little indirect . A factory employing over a thousand hands found itself in a position where it needed better co-operation from its employees . There had been no open antagonism , but the " feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workmen to take some interest in the success of the business , to realize all that was being done for them , and to co-operate . Merely as a business investment it was worth ten thousand dollars to get those men solidly behind that business . Now here was a clear-cut problem . Suppose the case is your own ! What will you do ? The man who was consulted about this particular case said , " Put up a letter-box and ask every man to drop into it any suggestion he can make for the success of the business , or any complaint of things not properly done . Offer rewards for helpful constructive criticisms . " Well , the box was put up , and I wish you could ' have seen the contents . It brought nothing but anonymous abuse ? sonic of it of the vilest sort . A few letters were merely contemptuous ; but others were insulting ! It was discouraging to read those attacks and still hope for co-operation . But the man who ordered that letter-box never felt one moment 's uneasiness as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had got to he played sooner or later with those men , before co-operation could come in that factory . It was the " search for the human , " and it was turning out exactly as he had expected . Men with grievances were having a chance to get rid of them ; the atmosphere had been heavily charged , and now it was clearing . Three weeks after the box was started , some man dropped into it a suggestion which was good , distinctly good . A check for $1,5oa was quietly handed to that man as he worked at his bench , with the statement that that was what his idea was worth to the firm . It represented to him the equivalent of two-years ' wages , and to many of them the savings of a life-time . If a bomb haddropped in that factory , it could not have made a greater psychological change . Two more checks a short time later to other workmen , one for $scio and one for $L000 ? and then with only $3,000 spent , the spirit of co-operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking how that business could be helped . One incident transpired which might have made trouble had not the same policy been followed . The president of the company chanced to hear a speech made by one of his workmen at a Sunday night labor meeting , in which he denounced the company for grinding the face of the poor in order to swell its ill-gotten gains . On Monday morning the president called the man to the office , and said , " I heard your speech last night ! " The man smiled grimly , and said , " You need n't trouble to discharge me ; I know that 's what you are going to do ! " The president replied , " That 's where you 're wrong the second time . I did n't call you down to discharge you , but to ask if you , or any of your men , understand figures and accounts . If you do n't , go and get a bookkeeper that does , and bring him here . Three of your men come with him . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workmen , and they realized , to their chagrin , that the company was having quite a hard time to get along . The discontent received a body blow on that day . In both of these cases there was present an element of surprise which always gives added power to any action . Before we leave this subject , some one - may say , " It 's easy to apply improved methods to a small retail business where things are slack , but it 's a very different thing to improve upon the system in some of our large establishments . " I know it is not easy to invent possible economies , to utilize waste products , or discover sources of new income in the highly organized business systems of to-day . But there is not one business in which human nature is not a factor , and with that as a guide , new methods can be discovered . It is in just these larger enterprises that the results of a little thinking grow into high figures . I was employed by two of the most perfectly systematized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Sugar Refining Company . They were both wonderfully organized , but as Mr. Havemeyer often admitted to me the superiority of the Standard Oil Company over his own company in organization , let me take the Standard Oil Company as an example . What can be accomplished there . ' Where will you And a weakness in that wonderful sys.tem ? Yet it is not so long ago that one man noticed a contrast in the stable bills of the different stations as a result of the careless measurements of different hostlers in the feeding of horses . A careful study was made , the proper amount of food to keep such a horse in the best possible condition was determined , and an order was issued that every horse in every stable should he fed , not by measure , but by weight ? just so many pounds and ounces per day . The saving effected . by that innovation amounted to nearly two hundred thousand dollars a year ! This is exactly the sort of thing that close study will disclose in many business establishments to-day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is taken of it in advertising . In all ordinary retailing of merchandise to the public , success seems to favor the men who occupy the opposite ends of the line of fair dealing ; that is , the man who is without any principle and the man who is overburdened with it . The dealer who is seemingly too dishonest to stay in business and the dealer who is seemingly too honest to stay in business are the ones who can make money . i As an instance of the success of " fool honesty , " let me tell a story . I once complained to a horse-dealer that he had lied about a horse he had sold . To make my words doubly offensive I added , " You lied unnecessarily . " At this he was off in a flash . " Never ! " he cried out ; " I never lie unnecessarily . " We had some words about this , and it ended in my wagering that I could sell a horse promptly , at a fair valuation , and without a single lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall , raw-boned animal with a Roman nose and a vicious eye . Apparentlythere was nothing to him but bones and bad temper . I refused to sell him until I knew something about him . The dealer agreed that I could n't sell him according to my prescribed standard of " fool honesty , ' unless I had personal knowledge of him . So I took him away to try him . The first day I had a veterinary look him over ; he said he could n't live more than a month , that his extreme thinness was due to chronic " scouring , " caused by some disease of the stomach . I went back to the horse-dealer and told him the story . I did n't ask him to give me another horse , but I did demand time in which to discover whether the veterinary was right . The dealer confessed that he was a little shy on time ; he had none of it to spare in this case ; he realized that as the old covenant reads , " time is of the essence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspected the horse could n't live , and must be sold quickly . So he could n't grant me any extension of time . I told that dealer what I thought of him . I offered to buy the horse and take my chances of selling . him , if he had the courage to make his bet without a time-limit . I even offered to double the stake . I used every argument and every epithet , and at last he accepted this revised bet . It was agreed that I was to buy the horse , and have as long a time to study and enjoy ( ! ) him as I wanted . Afterward , I was to sell him from the dealer 's stable , in the dealer 's presence , to tell only the truth about him , and to sell him at a fair price within one month after offering him . I paid for the animal and took him away . He was a marvel of unsoundness . He had spavins on both hind legs and splints on both front leg 's . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neutralized each other , for , strangely enough , he did n't go lame . There was only one name possible for him , so I christened him " Bones . " I tried driving him , but there was too much bony structure ; he seemed to rattle at every joint ; it really needed a shoe-horn to slip him into the shafts of a buggy . Then I tried riding him , and here I was delightfully disappointed . With his long , " springy " pasterns , he was as easy as a rocking-chair , while , despite his evil eye and general look of viciousness , he seemed to be gentle . But on that eye he could have brought a libel suit against his face and won a verdict from any rider . Standing fully sixteen and a half hands and looking like the slaughtering war-charger of Attila , it really needed John L. Sullivan on his back to make the ensemble complete . He never went exactly as he was headed . Ile was always reviewing imaginary troops on his right or left side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would gaze at the setting sun and gallop furiously north or south , champing his bit and acting as if the great trouble was scheduled to break out at any moment . But he was a fine humorist ; it was his one little joke ; the trouble never came . At the end of a month he was still alive . In three months he hadrown J so fat that I changed his name to ones . Two months more of unadulterated joy in his society , and then I carried him to the dealer 's stable and placed him on sale . I advertised him twice in the daily papers , and at last a buyer appeared in the person of a middle-aged , kindly , trusting gentleman , who looked as if he might be a small manufacturer in a country town . The dealer looked on with . a leery eye . He waited to hear me describe that horse without telling a lie . But instead of saying anything good about him , I began by calling attention to his defects . I told . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the various " outs " about the horse , for fear he might overlook some of them . Then I pointed out the spavins and the splints and the vicious eye ; I enlarged upon the veterinary 's death warning , and the scours 73 ? " But , " interrupted the man , " he did n't die in a month ! " " No , " I said , " he did n't , and he has n't died since , and he does n't scour any more , and he has n't stomach disease , and he is n't lame , and he is n't in the slightest degree vicious ; he 's just about the kindest , safest , most delightful horse I ever rode . But I wo n't sell this horse to any one without pointing Vo , .. CX X X I V. ? No. 802. - 67 out every defect that I know about him . " Then I told him what I thought of the way in which horses were usually sold by lying horse-dealers . The effect was like magic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he said , " I do n't know anything about horses , but that 's the horse I i want . " He bought and paid for him with almost indecent haste . It transpired that he was a somewhat timid doctor in a neighboring city , who knew little about riding a horse , but just ust been appointed on the governor 's staff . The dealer looked ' very chagrined when he saw the money pass ; I was getting an advance of thirty per cent . over the price I had paid ! Now observe the human nature in that transaction . There was a lot of it , from first to last . But the main point is this : the best way to sell many an article in this world is not to emphasize its merits , but its defects . That sounds paradoxical , but it is true of nearly everything that permits of a personal relation between buyer and seller . Disinterested frankness in the description of your wares is in the nature of a confidence , and confidence instantly establishes such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression of the personality of the seller , the rule holds . Let us analyze the value of truth in that horse trade . Bear in mind that few persons are good judges of horses . My buyer , not knowing horses , was looking for something to guide him . The moment he saw my frankness he felt he had found something he could depend on . The whole transaction , so far as he went , shifted then from the horse to its owner . From that moment he was not sizing up the horse ; he was sizing up me ! When he heard me tell the grim , unpalatable truth about the horse , he was judging . not horses , which he did n't know , but human nature , which he did know . He shook hands and counted out his money ? not in tribute to the horse 's excellence , but to the owner 's honesty . In fact , he was doing what you yourself do when a man comes into your office all aflame with the marvelous richness of a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodes , or amygdaloid , or calco-pyrite , but you do know something about human nature , so you pay no attention whatever to his glowing words ; they go in one ear and out the other . But you watch your man , and notice whether he 's up in the air or whether his two feet are firmly on the ground . In the latter case It 's a fair gamble ; which is the best you can say of any newly discovered copper-mine . But whether it 's selling a horse or floating a copper-mine , the principle is the same , and he who , disregarding his own interests , insists upon pointing out the defects in his property has taken the first sure step in its sale . I believe the gentleman who discovered the sor did value which attaches to frankness of this sort was Mr. John Wanamaker . Mr. Wanamaker 's reputation as an honest man is beyond dispute , so let it not be thought that I asperse his sincerity when I call attention to the remarkable prosperity which he so long achieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mr. W anamaker : " These 25-cent Handkerchiefs are a little dirty . We allow you . to cents for washing them . " ( As a laundry charges only one cent , the liberality of the proposition is appealing . ) Listen to the same story in another key : " There 's no good reason why a few finger - marks should make men 's Linen Handkerchiefs 50 cents each from a dollar . It has done it here just the same . " Here 's another : " Decorated Toilet Sets made up for ' Ivory ' finish . Now and then comes a piece where the ' Ivory ' is not of perfect polish . Possibly one in ten might mistrust it . Just the same , $7449 sets go at $4 . " Another : " Some of the most noteworthy stories by American authors . Bound in cloth , and made to sell at 50 cents . Our price .1-0 cents . Some of the covers may be a trifle soiled . " ( Yes , some of those covers may be a trifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless Mr. Wanamaker insists . ) The use of this kind of disinterested appeal , continued through many years of his advertising , brought him to the very top rung of the prosperity ! adder , - while the business world sat at his feet and learned the commercial value of telling the truth . Remember that it is no question of sincerity or insincerity , but merely of the strong appeal which frankness makes to all of us . The sincerity is almost always taken at its face value . This brings up the general question of the force of the advertising appeal . Now we are coming to close quarters with our subject . The root of all we are seeking . lies right here . You will find a great many men who can prepare advertisements that attract attention ; it takes little skill to do that . You will find a smaller number who can make the advertisement carry conviction ; yet even that is not enough ! You have got to carry your reader beyond conviction , into action . Your appeal must put a hair-cloth shirt on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must arouse him to nothing short of purchase ; for conviction which does not eventuate in action tends only to paralyze the will . It is not enough to prepare advertisements that compel admiration , excite wonder , and delight the reader ; they must sell the goods ! Admiration is of no value unless it records itself on the sales-book . What is the test of a great preacher ? Massillon gave us the answer two hundred years ago : " The test of the preacher , " said he , " is not when his congregation come enthusiastically from church and wildly praise him , saying , ' Oh what a magnificent sermon ! What a wonderful preacher ! ' but when they come quietly out of church saying only , ' I will do something ! ' " You must apply that to your advertising . Not praise , but power ; not compliments , but conviction ; that must be the foot-rule for measuring its performance . The effect of Massillon 's preaching is exactly the effect which you want to produce by your adver-tising . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Massillon by the king ? ( perhaps the greatest ever given to a subject by his sovereign , and that sovereign the Grand Monarque of France ) ? " Father , I have heard many great orators , and I have been satisfied with them ; but , as for you , whenever I hear you , I am dissatisfied with myself ! " Here is the result to strive for in advertising . Make each reader dissatisfied with himself until he follows your suggestion . Massillon was one man in a hundred thousand , and naturally his standard seems high . But on the other hand , he was doing something a hundred times more difficult than the i mere selling of goods ; and it is not too much to insist that no advertising argument is complete if it stops short of making the sale . But now some one will say that advertising can not create a demand . I agree with you . Advertising does not create a demand . It never did ! It never can ! Then why is conviction so i important , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a demand can be supplied ? For this reason : heCause the impulse to action must come under your control , must move at your summons , must be exercised in the hour you select . And then , too , the problem is not so i simple as it looks . Make no mistake ! Advertising does not create a new , previously non-existent demand , but it can and does constantly remind the public of a demand that they had forgotten , or suggest a demand that was not fully realized before . Consideration of the convincing force of the appeal brings us to the writing of advertisements . The advertisementwritera man whose work is seldom appreciated , a man who can save or lose your money without your detecting it ? seldom receives from his employer a ' proper amount of either praise or blame . " Write me a short editorial , Mr. Dana . " said a caller in the office of the New York Sun . And Mr. Dana replied that he had no time to write a short editorial , as it might take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long editorial , for he could do that in a few minutes . Yet every advertisement-writer will agree with me that he has been told a score of times , " Do n't stop to write a long ad . I want to get this all into three inches , so that every one will read it . You can do that easily in ten minutes ! " The man who can put a long ad. into three inches " so that every one will read it , " will probably take half a day in doing it , but if he does it successfully , even in that time , he is worth from three to six times what you are now paying him . It is said that Conan Doyle received for his last Sherlock Holmes stories the sum of fifty cents a word , and Theodore Roosevelt is reputed to have received for his African work the highest price ever paid to an author erne dollar a word ! But the words of an advertisement - writer cost five dollars each to his employer if the advertisement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers . Take the case of a full-page ad. in the three or four Sunday papers of one of our large . cities . When your advertisement writer is able to present his case equally well and reduce his space only one-fortieth , he is worth about twenty-five hundred dollars a year more to you . In other words , saving a tiny finger-nail strip of space across the page of each Sunday paper in your city means half of all the salary you are paying him . The next time he wants a raise of salary , just think of this . To a large percentage of the readers of this magazine , perhaps the most important question about advertising lies at the very threshold of the subject and should have been considered before . That question is whether to advertise or not . Why study the psychology of successful advertising unless you plan to make some use of your knowledge ? " To advertise or not to advertise , " is a problem . The solution awaits you at the end of a path beset with pitfalls . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question , and if you travel on the line of least resistance you will probably end by plunging into advertising as into a fool 's paradise . It is safe to say that most men in business need the spur rather than the rein , yet men will invest in advertising who would not think of taking an equal risk in any other direction . After all , the only path for a man here is the analytical , matter-of-fact , " **28;272;TOOLONG " route . Let us follow the analysis of an advertising proposition from this point of What shall I take for an illustrative view . AN case ? There are so many things to advertise , so many ways of advertising , so many vehicles For spending the money , that no single illustration can be regarded as typical . Let us choose wholly at random . Here on my desk is a letter which reachedme recently from a Friend who is a lawyer in Montreal , asking whether he had better advertise in a United States legal directory . To insert his card will cost fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already taken similar cards ? eloquent testimony that the investment commends itself to their judgment . I do not know the legal directory ? I have never seen a copy of the book ? but with due allowance for my shortcoming let us see what it really offers . Suppose you look at it in this way : The man who must employ a lawyer in Montreal , if he is to advantage my friend and give him a run for his fifty dollars , must , as a sine qua non have subscribed for that directory , or at least know of its existence and consult it for reference . Figuring by the doctrine of chance and taking the chances at par one hundred , we shall ave to elim. inate a certain percentage of the one hundred on that score ; say we take off a modest ten per cent . Next , he may possibly have his correspondent already and so not want my friend ; off comes another five per cent . Next , if he has no lawyer in mind , he may very naturally consult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as against an unknown quantity ; off comes another fifteen per cent . at least . Next he will very likely ask his banker for the name and address of the solicitor the bank employs in Montreal ; another ten per cent . dropped . Other methods may be adopted and the very last idea will be to take as his trusted , confidential representative a " name " from a directory list , for the very good reason that the known is preferable to the unknown . Then , too , there is always a slight chance that the name chosen at random from a directory list may be friendly to the other side . So that , adding all these minus quantities , we get at least fifty per cent . off , and possibly more , before the advertisement is resorted to . Then our man finds the cards of twenty firms from which to choose , so that my friendwill have one chance only in the list of twenty , which reduces the possibility of his being chosen to about two and a half per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars by any direct return in business is so ridiculously small that it amounts to a gamble which no sane man would entertain in any other - speculation . Then how shall we explain the cards of the other lawyers ? Is it vanity , a desire to be noted as " among those present " ? Very likely this enters into the question . Some may suggest that they get an indirect return which can not he traced . But that is exactly what I refuse to believe . In this case all the real benefits to be derived are in plain sight , and such an advertisement must pay its own bills in direct returns , or it is a far cry in the wilderness . My advice to my friend will be Punch 's advice to those . about to marry , " Do n't l " Let us run over a few other " don'ts " in the general advertising field . First do n't imagine that all notoriety is good . Mere attention is not enough , if to procure it you have done anything which repels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coarse , or vulgar , or silly , or sacrilegious . Never sacrifice propriety or a decent self-respect . Be wise without being hard ; be gay without being frivolous . Do n't advertise an article which is incorporated in a larger article , unless you first study the situation with great care . If you are advertising such a product as the springs of a carriage , or the eyelets of a shoe , , make up your mind whether you want to reach the manufacturers through the people or the people through the manufacturers . There are advantages each way , but the methods in one case are totally different from what are needed in the other . In one case you must advertise the article itself ; in the other case the incorporated product . Do n't attempt any campaign which runs counter to fashion . This is setting yourself against human nature , and of course you will fail . Do n't project a plan which contributes in any way , even unconsciously , to rob a man of his satisfaction with himself , with his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not on sentimental or moral grounds , but because you will be bucking against a stone wall without seeing it . That wall is self-respect . You can never reap advantage if you suggest that a man is below others in rank or station . Finally ? and this is a very important " do n't , " ? do n't be afraid of publicity so long as dignity is not sacrificed . There are manufacturers who constantly hold back in their advertising because they themselves lack courage , farsightedness , and impersonality of view . They can not seize upon a bold opportunity . I am reminded of one such lost opportunity in my experience . The story is not without its lessons . It was the case of a furniture-house in one of our six largest cities , and although it contained other furniture-stores , the firm in question , by its persistence in a somewhat individualized form of advertising , had developed a very large business in that locality . Almost from the first I had one ambition for that house , one goal I wanted it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house in the world to dare to insert its advertisements without any signature . We will say that the name was Smith . I wanted them to take the attitude that they had acquired so much of the furniture business in that city . that the words " Smith " and " furniture were there synonymous . If you said " furniture , " you said " Smith 's " ; if you talked of buying furniture you were speaking of Smith 's place . It looked like a hazardous proposition , but every detail had been worked out so carefully that the risk was very slight . The real safeguard lay in the fact that the advertisements were strikingly individualized , that they had appeared for over a dozen years ? always in the same type , always in the same style , always on the same page , always in the same corner . They were as familiar and as official as a trade-mark . But lest some chance reader did not know the name , another safeguard had been arranged . The articles which it Was planned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be bought at any other store in town . So if by accident a customerwent to another dealer , that dealer could not nil the order , and the articles were to be described in such a way that substitution would be neither practicable to the dealer nor acceptable to the customer . From this plan , if successful , great advantages would accrue . The unusual spectacle of such a proceeding was to be " reported " by newspapers all over the country , so that a million persons would learn for the first time that the furniture trade of one of the foremost American cities was controlled by a single house who were now prepared to ship goods to every State in the Union . But you will say , perhaps , that Smith 's did not control the furniture business of that city ! And you are entirely right ? they did not . But on no other hypothesis would it be possible to explain how Smith could advertise in all the daily papers and insert no signature . The action proved the assumption . The advertisement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hint of private interest . Incidentally , the omission of the signature , which consumed nearly an inch of space , would he a saving of one-seventh of the entire advertising expense ? and this was quite an item . Now for the results ! A table was advertised in the newspapers one day without any signature . Smith 's sales-book did not reflect the slightest indication that any omission had occurred in their advertising . They sold nearly one hundred tables on the first day , and received thirty orders by mail . Daily papers in several cities , in half-column editorials , called attention to " this original , daring , and successful experiment in advertising . " But just when it seemed to have passed the experimental stage the company closed its eyes to what I believe was one of the best opportunities to make a name for itself that a retail firm ever had . Can you imagine yourself advertising anything ? dry-goods , for instance ? with no signature attached ? If you can not imagine yourself doing it , then stop and realize what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day for three months , would have made in the retail world .
