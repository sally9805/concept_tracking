AMERICAN manufacturers are to-day paying la one million dollars more a day than they did a ago . This statement is based on the assertion an important official of the Department of Comme who declared that increased wages granted American bor had , in the past six months , added three-hundred lion dollars a year to the payrolls of American industri On every hand , signs of industrial and labor prosperi are apparent . Labor possesses the spirit to attain certain ob'e that have always appealed to it . When it secures hih wages , it then sets out to secure shorter hours . Throuz out the country , labor is now in a constant state of a gression , prepared to fight for what it terms its rig1t : prepared to carry out its policies without regard to t : possible effect on local , state , or national affairs . Greatest and gravest of all labor problems is t which is now affecting the railroads of the country . . this issue of THE FORUM is going to press ( August 15 the four railway brotherhoods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the freight servi are voting on a strike . The railroads have been asked t reduce the basic working day from ten to eight hou A total of 350,000 men have through their unions plac before the railroads demands that will , if they are succe ful , compel the roads to pay out $100,000,000 more eac year in wages to this branch of transportation servic The four railroad brotherhoods have presented demand They will not accept government arbitration . The rai roads must either concede , or face a strike . This is one n the gravest situations that has ever developed in the railroad world . Throughout the country , commercial bodies have been aroused . On every hand , protests are pouring into Congress and to the President to stop any effort on the part of the trainmen to tie up the systems , and to com pel the arbitration of the difficulties . The entire situation is worthy of detailed analysis . The trainmen in their propaganda have claimed that their demands are solely for an eight-hour day , and not for increased wages . Throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad freight day has been fixed at ten ours or 100 miles . The demand for eight hours is accompanied by what is termed a punitive clause that the railroads shall pay time and a half for overtime work . The railroads insist that the change will cost them $100 , - 000,000 a year . By reducing the basic working day to eight hours the men will secure what would be equivalent to a 25 per cent . wage advance , and the overtime based on this increased wage would mean an advance of 87 ? per cent . Let us go thoroughly into the matter . There are 660,000 owners of railroad stock whose total value is S6,000,000,000 . Include bonds , etc. , and the aggregate value is brought up to $15,700,000,000 . The roads each year receive on this investment of six billion dollars a net income of $300,000.000 , or 5% per cent . In 1914 the railroads paid $1,381,000,000 in wages to employees or 45.3 per cent . of the gross income of $3,047,000,000 . The railroads contend that 45 cents out of every dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To take $100,000,000 more out of the earnings each year would deprive the carriers of much more than the gain they have obtained from the 5 per cent . increase in freight rates allowed them . The railroads had to fight tooth and nail to secure this 5 per cent . increase in freight rates ; and now they must fight tenaciously to retain it . What is more , this $100,000,000 would go to only 18 per cent . of the railroad workers . The four brotherhoods with their membership of 350,000 constitute only 18 per cent . of the railroad army . This 18 per cent . now gets 28 per cent . of all the wages paid out by the railroads . The other 82 per cent . receives an average salary of $700 a year , while the brotherhoods secure an average salary of $1,260 a year . Every dollar that the trainmen demand means lower wages for the clerks , the station men , porters , signal men , trackmen and hosts of other employees who get an average wage of S700 a year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York and in the Pennsylvania Terminal in New York expected a wage increase in January 1 , and when it was not forthcoming hoped that they would receive it on May 1 . The trainmen , however , with the power of coercion want whatever the railroads can distribute among their workers . There can be no flat eight-hour work-day for trainmen in freight service . Some trainmen will work more than eight hours , some less . Railroads were built on ten-hour , or 100-mile run basis . Railroad stations are n spaced so nicely apart that a trainmen can quit work at th end of eight hours . For instance , 56 western railroads last year paid the sum of $1,403,038 to engineers and firemen for which they received no return , this payment being made on the " or less " basis . The trainman receives a full ten hours wage whether he works only six hours or ten hours , operates his train 60 miles or 100 miles . But in the event of his working beyond ten hours or running more than 100 miles , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either ten hours , or 100 miles . The wage is fixed on whatever basis will yield the most . An engineer running a fast freight which can travel 150 miles in ten hours will secure a mileage rate . A man running a slow freight train that will only go 75 miles in ten hours will secure 10 hours wages . The entire situation has gone beyond the control of the railroads and the carriers have announced that they will welcome intervention by the government and adjustment of the situation by either the Interstate Commerce Commission or any other body ap pointed for the- work . The Interstate Commerce Com mission would be preferable . It knows what the railroads earn , because it fixes the rates that they can charge . VVhen the problem of adjusting freight and passenger rates was too large for the railroads and the public to adjust for themselves , the Federal Government stepped in and created the Interstate Commerce Commis sion . The Federal Government assumes control of the income of the roads and it can , and will be compelled , to assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phase of politics enters . What administration will be strong enough to placate both the trainmen and the railroads . In past arbitrations , the trainmen contend that they were treated unfairly in the awards . Is there not some significance attached to the fact that the trainmen are making demands in a presidential year . Is it conceiv able that the Wilson Administration will step in two months before election and compel the trainmen to accept arbitration . Bear in mind that 350,000 trainmen are voters ! Every one of them will cry " Hands Off ! This is our own affair ! Meddle and our votes will be lost . " I do not say this in any sense derogatory of the Wilson Administration . Any Administration would be in a similar plight . But 350,000 men are only a small portion of the 100,000,000 population ; and it remains to be seen whether 350,000 can dictate to the remaining 100,000,000 . Our Government can compel arbitration . It proved its right to fix railroad rates and it can prove its right to fix wages . Neither would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arbitrate . They contend that the Newlands Act does not provide for arbitration except in the event of a strike being imminent . As yet , no strike is imminent , they say . A short time ago the Delaware &; Hudson Railroad had a strike on its hands . The trainmen declined to arbitrate and forced the railroad to concede . A railroad strike would tie up every line in the coun try and would plunge the nation into adversity . Our pres ent-day prosperity would be quickly wiped out . Can 18 per cent . of the railroad employees use their power to de prive the remaining 82 per cent . of employment ? A strike as threatened , would paralyze industry . The railroads are the life-blood of our every-day existence . Our foodstuffs would be tied up ; our manufactures could not move ; the raw materials that the factories need could not be ob tained , forcing plants to suspend . Coal would not be available , and even the traction lines would be forced to stop for lack of fuel with which to generate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gulf , the Atlantic and the Pacific would be affected . The situation would be worse than war ; worse than an invading army wreck ing havoc and desolation in its path . From a national railroad strike there could be no escape . Until the firm mind and the firm hand of the Govern ment stepped in and compelled the operation of the roads , a situation approximating what is now considered im possible , the enforced idleness of 100,000,000 people , would be developed . The farmer and the city man would suffer alike . The farmer could not move his products to market . His crops would go to ruin , causing him a double loss . The city dweller would lack foodstuffs , and millions of people would face want owing to the prices that would be charged for the small supply of foodstuffs that are held by stores in the cities . And then what of outbreaks ? Our militia to-day is down in Texas . Three hundred thousand men are on the Mexican border ; and the trainmen could stir up , turmoil , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the opera bouffe republics of the South , unable to maintain order within its borders . We would be unable to control the labor men in their fight for control . Action must be taken by the Government . The trainmen are powerful . They have money in their treasury . They have 3,500,000 other unionists behind them . They believe that in a battle of economic power they can whip the railroads into submission . The railroads will not be the chief sufferers . It will be the innocent third party , the public , that will feel the heavy hand of panic . The Chambers of Commerce of the United States have just asked Congress to direct the Interstate Commerce Commission to stay the railroad crisis . It is pointed out that 350,000 men , wielding the power , control and injure the remaining 100,000 , - 000 population . An eight-hour day would not prevent overtime . If the eight-hour day prevails , the railroads would have to meet it in one of three ways : ( 1 ) Pay the increased wages under present working conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as to shorten the time of train runs ; ( 3 ) reduce the length of trains so that they could be run at higher speeds to escape the penalty of overtime . Now , the first solution would mean adding $100,000 , - 000 a year to the payroll , this enormous sum being taken by 18 per cent . of the railway employees . The reconstruction of roads to shorten the time of freight runs would mean the building of new terminals which would be a physical impossibility . To cut down the length of trains , which is the third course open to the roads , would increase the cost of operation . Four-fifths of all of the tonnage moving in the east is made up of low-grade slowmoving freight carried at the lowest rates in the world . A ton of freight in the east is carried three miles for the cost of a two-cent postage stamp . The trainmen say : cut the trains in two , then there will be no slow trains and no overtime . The long train has been one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in two or three would mean additional crews and greater expense . Why were the great big locomotives conceived if it were not for the handling of the long freight trains ? These long freight trains have held down American freight rates so that they are the cheapest in the world . If two train loads of grain coming from Chicago must be cut into three trains , then three locomotives and three crews must be provided . No matter what alternative is taken , the results would be costly . The Interstate Com merce Commission does not allow the railroads to increase their rates . They contend that the rates are high enough and that the public can pay no more . When 18 per cent . of the trainmen railway employees however de mand $100,000,000 more a year , which is equivalent to a 5 per cent . increase in freight rates both in the East and the West , the Interstate Commerce Commission must be ready to grant higher rates . Slow trains East of Chicago are necessary to keep down the cost of living . Think what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were moved on a fast train so that a trainman would enjoy an eight-hour day ! Sixty per cent . of the tonnage moved East of Chicago consists of coal , ore , coke , stone and other mine products . To the public , there is no difference whether the time of transportation is two days or four days , so long as there is a continual stream coming into the market . There is a difference , however , if the public is compelled to pay 5 per cent . more freight on these commodities ; so that the trains can move quicker , giving the trainmen an eight-hour day . It is the public that pays . Bear in mind the trainmen are only 18 per cent . of the railway employees ! They only move the trains . They do not keep the books , create the tariffs , buy the equip ment , keep the rails in order , make new construction such as terminal station buildings , grading , signaling , repair ing , etc . Their duty is only to move the trains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaded on the cars and is unloaded from the cars . Once the cars are connected in the yards , they are off with no further wor ries aside from those incidental to regular railroading . To disconnect the cars is a matter of a few moments ' work . The trainmen now have the upper hand . When the run is less than ten hours , they demand ten hours pay . When the run is more than 100 miles , they demand pay on a mileage basis . Whichever method of compensation amounts to the highest , that method is the one they demand and secure . Now , are the trainmen poorly paid ? The average wages of the engineers in 1915 were $1,892 a year , the conductors $1,719 a year , the firemen $1,117 a year , and the brakemen $1,013 a year . These figures are not doctored . They represent the actual amount of money given out to the trainmen during 1915 . They get 28 per cent . of the wages paid by the carriers . They get more than the others who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts it , " they control economic power . " The views of Samuel Gompers on the general labor situation are of interest . Throughout his discussion of the situation , the spirit of Socialism inspires : " The shorter workday is a condition which makes possible improvements in all other ways , " says Mr. Gompers . " The shorter workday transforms workers , who have daily worked a long period of time , into different individuals , physically , mentally and socially . It protects the workers against the consequences of over-exhaustion , assures to them time for the upbuilding of strength and the generation of new energy . The railroad brotherhoods have presented a straight demand for an eight-hour day , and in order to force that regulation they have associated with the demand penalties for overtime that would make the managers careful in indiscriminately prolonging hours of labor beyond the standard eight hours . " In reply to the question why the railroad men refuse to arbitrate , whereas the American Federation of Labor has nearly in all previous cases been a strong supporter of arbitration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the representatives of the railroad men for refusing arbitration are extremely significant and have a deep meaning for all workers . President Garretson of the Railway Conductors , stated that under its power the Interstate Commerce Commission did not have authority to consider hours of work and wages of employees , and furthermore there was no intention on the part of railroad men to have a tribunal pass on their demands , for the reason the railway brotherhoods have always combated the idea of a government tribunal to fix wages . " As a result of years of experience the railway brotherhoods have reached the conclusion that their welfare and protection depends upon the exercise of economic power . In presenting their demands , they relied solely upon conferences between representatives of those directly concerned and have repeatedly stated that they preferred , if driven to the last point , to trust their claims to the results of economic action . " Right here I must interrupt Mr. Gompers ' statement . It is all well and good for the strongest to be on top , for the weak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of the railroads , the trainmen are not the strongest . By putting their claims to economic action , Mr. Gompers means that the railroads will suffer more by the loss of earnings than will the trainmen . This of course is natural . Then Mr. Gompers continues : " Now is a great time for the organized labor movement . Estimating progress made , discloses substantial gains in wages , reductions in hours of work and improvement in working conditions . Labor has learned the strength of unions , and the collective protection of economic power . They have learned that those who are necessary to the world 's production need not be the victims of employers ' oppression and greed . They recognize no divine right to exploitation . By enlightened self-interest , cooperation and the experiences accumulated from the experience of years , they have learned to take advantage of opportunities , to press home demands for greater justice and to maintain their power ready for use . Toilers of America , now is the time for activity . Now is the time to make an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , educate and organize . " Labor is on the Offensive . I use only the words of Samuel Gompers and other labor leaders when I say that labor is on the offensive , and with the power that the war-created trade has given them , it is planning to force the manufacturers to concede all of their pet theories , or in any event , as many as labor can ram down the throats of capital . The astute head of the American Federation of Labor declared in speaking at a mass meeting at the Milwaukee Auditorium that is was the aim of the unions to secure more than had already been granted , and " when we get that more , we will want still more . " Mr. Gompers asserted that in this respect labor was no different from the capitalist . " A man making $3.00 a day wants S3.25 . A man with 5800,000 wants $200,000 more , so that he can say that he is a millionaire . And a man with $400,000,000 wants the earth . " Surely , well put , when Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time will manufacturers ever grant the complete ideals of labor with respect to hours of employment and wages . The further Mr. Gompers goes in his demands the nearer to Socialism he approaches . Bearing in mind that labor organizations of the United States have a total membership of only 31/2 per cent . of the total population , 3,500,000 men to 100,000,000 population , the power possessed by the unions to sway conditions in their direction is only at its greatest when manufacturers are urgently in need of help . Labor is to-day on the offensive . It has been on the offensive for over six months and has made progress . The Germans in the early days of the war were on the offensive ; but each foot of ground taken by them has only served to increase the acrimony of the Allies . So with labor ! Each gain of labor has served to make the manufacturers bitter . The day of reckoning is coming . Labor has been belligerent . It has garotted manufacturers . It has forced the accession to its demands . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there must be a readjustment . There must be a restoration to a balance . Using all the experience derived from strikes of the past , labor leaders have astutely carried out their propaganda for the increasing of wages and for the shortening of hours . Ever since the fall of 1915 , when manufacturers of all kinds were appealing for help to fill their orders , labor has pressed home its advantage . Manufacturers made natural concessions to labor . They offered higher wages . These natural concessions were unavoidable , the manufacturers being under the pressure of orders as the production of munitions could not wait any final adjustment of disputes with the unions . In November of 1915 , while talking with a prominent labor leader , I drew out the following startling statement : " This is labor 's opportunity and hour . We will not allow the contracting employers to secure all of the profits of this imperative but transient activity in the production of war supplies . Our demands will not be made all over the country at once . We will start in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New England and the entire country . As fast as we settle one strike , we will take up another . Just like the military strategists , all efforts are to be concentrated at one point and this tremendous pressure that we can exert will quickly remove all obstacles . Then , the steam roller will move along . The present time is the best that has ever happened for us in the last 14 years . To-day there are three jobs for every man and the bosses are crying for help . This is our time , and can you blame us if we take it ? " True to his words , the era of strikes began at Schenectady , at the great works of the General Electric Company . It then moved along to Bridgeport and spread throughout the Naugatuck Valley . It came down to New Jersey , down to Philadelphia , to Baltimore , to Pittsburgh , to Chicago and then west . Everywhere that labor has attacked it has been successful with but one exception , and that was the Westinghouse strike at Pittsburgh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by giving wage increases before being asked . Thus , the United States Steel Corporation gave two wage increases of 10 per cent . each , which will cost it $40,000,000 more each year . A half million steel workers are benefited . The anthracite miners used their power to exact a seven to fifteen per cent . wage increase and a reduction in hours from nine to eight , and tied these gains up in a four-year agreement . Every householder in the east who made a practice of laying in coal early in summer , securing summer prices , found in May of this year that there would be no summer prices . Over S7,000,000 additional was paid out by householders for coal in order to give the anthracite miners their wage increase . I have prepared some figures showing a few of the wage increases . On May 1st last , a column of 100,000 strikers marched in New York , while in the West 125,000 strikers were in line in various cities . Now contrast this with the condition that prevailed a year previous . In April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behalf of the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics , conducted a canvas of its policy holders in New York , to ascertain the number of idle workers . It found that in 155,960 families in New York , there were 45,421 idle people . In December , 1914 , Judge E. H. Gary , as chairman of the Mayors ' Committee on Unemployment , estimated that over 200,000 workers were without jobs in New York City . The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated the unemployment in New York City as involving 442,000 people . About six months ago , when wage advances first began to be announced , the newspapers were printing them in large type displayed on the first page . Wage increases became so frequent that it was not long after that no attention was given to them . The newspapers first seized on the wage increases as evidence of prosperity . To what extent wages have been actually increased no one will ever be able to tell with any marked degree of accuracy . The Government statistics are not wholly complete and accurate ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would add about S100,000,000 to those figures would in all probability come close to the exact figure of wage increases . Wages all over the country have gone up . I talked with a contractor , who has business interests in all the large cities and asked him to what extent he was paying increased wages . He rang a bell and asked a clerk to bring him the wage scale . " Now listen , " he said . " Before the war I could get any number of common laborers in the East at $1 to $1.50 a day ; while in the West , I could get them at $1.25 a day . To-day I am paying carpenters in Chicago 60c. an hour , against 40 to 45c. an hour a few months ago . At Buffalo common labor is being paid 271/2c. an hour against S1.50 a day . At Cleveland I am paying 30c. an hour , at Cincinnati 25c. an hour , at Racine , Wis. , 30c. an hour , at Kansas City , where there is no shortage , 171/2c. an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day , and nonunion $2.50 a day ; at Chicago union wages are 42 ? c. an hour , and non-union 311/4c. an hour . Talk about prosperity . Why , it has hurt my business rather than benefited it ! I specialize in municipal , state and federal work , and with the exception of federal work , my business has decreased in volume . Cities and states are not going to pay high prices for improvements . Materials are high and labor is skyrocketing . Public improvements are paid by taxes , and it is a wise administration that keeps the taxes down when the cost of living is up . " The city of Boston proposed to lay 15 miles of waterpipe this summer and had actually ordered the pipe when the manufacturer received a cancellation of the order , because labor could not be obtained to lay the pipe . The city of New York planned to build several piers on the North River to accommodate 1,000-foot steamers , but had to reject bids three times before prices that came within the appropriation were secured . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could save some money by buying 52,000 tons of steel outright for subway and elevated lines . It got a good price but rejected the bids ; the chairman of the commission asserting that the taxpayers would rather wait for two years for these improvements than pay the high cost for materials . The city of Philadelphia is holding in abeyance elevated improvements that will cost $75,000,000 until labor costs and material prices are lower . In New York City , the Pennsylvania Railroad plans to build a monster hotel alongside its terminal , and has already let the contracts for erection on a percentage basis , but will not allow the work to go ahead until material prices come down . Robert H. Ingersoll , of the famous dollar watch , is head of a company that will build a large hotel in the theatre district . The Statler interests are to build a hotel , while the New York Central will build another hostelry opposite its station . All these projects are held in abeyance . Plans are filed with the building department for over 50 high-class apartment houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not go ahead until costs are lowered . One of the great union contentions is that shorter hours and higher wages act to promote efficiency . This contention is directly in contrast with the results of a canvas conducted by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank . It was ascertained that labor will not work despite the high wages and decreased efficiency has accompanied the increases in compensation . The large manufacturing plants in Pennsylvania and New Jersey reported that it was impossible to secure sufficient men for three eighthour shifts and production had been so severely contracted that some plants were in danger of having bonds for faithful performance of contracts closed . The manufacturers wrote that they had difficulty in keeping men at work . One wrote that the moving-picture houses are filled with workingmen every day in the towns near the large factories , and that there is plenty of evidence elsewhere that labor is not taking advantage of the present situation to benefit itself . Insead of taking advantage of the higher wages to save money or better their condition , a large proportion of the workingmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their usual weekly wage . And even while at work , the employers reported , the men have been lazy and independent . The latter is one of the alarming conditions . Artisans , mechanics and laboring men have lost what small respect they had for their employers . Remonstrance has failed to curb the spread of insolence , instead an effort to stir up the men has led to strikes or the men quitting without notice . " Labor as a whole , certainly north of the Mason and Dixon line and east of the Mississippi , is suffering from a species of insanity , " wrote one large manufacturer . " It does not know what it wants , but it wants more . " A shipbuilder sent in a poster used in England , which he declared represented a condition now prevailing here : " Do n't scab upon the unemployed by working hard , " read the poster . " Slow work means more jobs . More jobs means less unemployment . Less competition means high wages , less work , more pay . Slow down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large steel company wrote : " It is not so much that the men are expecting and demanding high wages , as that they are not inclined to give a reasonable return for wage . They will not take orders from their superiors , and they take many holidays . Laboring men do not seem to take advantage of the situation to improve their conditions . Instead of realizing that the present harvest is likely to be short , working steadily and saving money , they are in clined to be extravagant and wasteful of time . " Another declares : " Not only have rates gone up , but the efficiency of labor has gone down . " A coal mining concern asserted that " in the bituminous field the labor situation is unsettled , and the miners are dissatisfied and seem glad of an excuse to quit their jobs . " A textile con cern declared : " Mills report enough orders to run at ca pacity for some time , but inability to operate more than two-thirds of their plants on account of the shortage and independence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to keep overhead expenses at a minimum , and profits have been and will continue to be cut proportionately unless the price of the product is increased . " A steel maker wrote : " They ( labor ) have become so independent that it is very difficult to keep dis cipline , and instead of attempting to earn more money at the high rates , they simply reduce the amount of work they turn out or else take time off when they have earned the weekly wage to which they are accustomed . " Still another steel plant declared that the uncertainty had prevented it from renewing contracts running a year ahead ; as they could not figure on their labor costs and output . " Summarizing the replies the agent of the Federal Reserve Bank declared : " There is universal complaint that as wages are increased , a large class of wage earners become less productive ; and the failure of industrial plants to make sufficient or reasonable output is preventing the realization of much if any profit from operations . Instead of taking advantage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently not netting much more than formerly , when wages were much lower ; the cost of living for them , as for others , is much higher , and the whole country is suffering a great economic loss through the failure of our industrial plants to produce the volume of goods for which there is at present so great a demand . " Manufacturers of America have not idly stood by and watched labor make inroads . They are working quietly but effectively ; and when the condition of trade is once again normal the retribution coming will precipitate a crisis . It is but natural that the manufacturers should use the whip once the handle comes into their control . Labor is now flogging the manufacturers , and Gompers , Morrison , Walsh , and the rest of the reactionaries are gleefully writing in their labor publications of the accomplishment of labor 's control over capital . Labor has always believed that the welfare work of the employers was merely a snare . The unions have always attacked welfare propositions . The unions do not want the workers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The National Association of Manufacturers at their Convention in May took steps to oppose labor 's domination . It was planned to work actively against legislation that was fostered to labor unions . This work was not to be carried out in a spirit of aggression , but through the power that the concerted effort of American business men can fairly use to protect their interests .
