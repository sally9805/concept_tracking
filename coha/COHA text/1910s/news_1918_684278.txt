txt How much the Republicans have learned since they last had a majority ha the House of Representatives no man can say . We hope that they have learned that the doctrine that the taxpayers exist to be exploited by ? Payne-Aldrich tariffs for the benefit of ' a , group of protected manufacturers contrblling the making et tariffs is no longer accepted in this country . They must have learned , too , that these are days of progress , that reaction should have its limits . The Democrats , we think , have lost control of the House chiefly because they have not forgotten enough . They did not make the wisest use of their power , they were inclined to arbitai  --  iness , they had not forgotten the supine nature of Northern Democrats sevva , ty years ago , and behaved accordingly . A chairmanship given to a Northern Democrat here and there would have done no harm .

Still , it may be Mr. Ceacoe KrrcHIN 's talk rather than his taxes prompted the rebuke . Laying taxes in billions , the author of the bill le'ould be wise to temper his budget speeches with a note of sorrow ; Mr. GLADSTONE often did that . The present Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee always exulted. lie had a fierce joy in taxing wealth , not merely wealth as commonly understood , but wealth in the most modest ilee-7.ees , represented , for example , by tile ability to own a shirt costing more than $1.50 . He openly expressed his purpose to put his taxes chiefly 1:pon the North , because the North had wanted us to go into the war . That was more resented , perhaps , than the taxes themselves . It was an amazing blunder , and we think the regret most prevalent in the country today is that Mr. KITCHIN could not pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we could intimately search the hearts of people we should probably discover that the opposition to President WILSON 'S war policies , the fear that he would be too lenient with Germany , had nothing to do with the return of the Republican majority in the House . The leaders raised that preposterous issue , the people were not moved by it . Nor was Mr. WILSON 'S appeal to the country for a Democratic House the cause of the reversal . It is much more probable that by that appeal he saved many districts to his party . The set of the current was against the Democrats for domestic reasons ; it is reasonable to suppose that his appeal may have stayed its flow in some parts of the country . The Democrats in the House have a strong inclination to Government ownership of railroads and telegraphs and telephones . The experience of the country under Government operation of both these public utilities , we feel confident , has set the people decidedly against Government ownership . They have borne its inflictions patiently , cheerfully , because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means and will be glad to see the end of it . The Republicans will ' have to share the responsibility of attending to this matter and to many other problems on re- , adjustment after the war is over . Some indications of their intentions emu their policies may be found in the choice the new .
