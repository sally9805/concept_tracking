txt President Wilson 's decision to place all the military resources of the natioh , including its deep reservoirs of man-power , at the disposal of General Foch and the , Entente Allies for use when needed in the campaign against Germany , is being followed by definite plans for putting more men In France at the earliest possible moment . Not only is it the purpose of the ' President , as Commander in Chief of the Army , to rush all troops in training over to Europe as rapidly as it can be ! done constantly with the Aatety of they great movement of ; nen involved , but it is the plan to hurry along the second draft and increase the size of the second call to the colors . Several weeks ago ** announced that the basic number for the second call would be approximately 800,000 men . It is , un- . derstood that plans have now been made for nearly doubling the number of . men to be drafted during the next twelve months . The statement ' was made today that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drafted will probably be much nearer 1,50006 , bringing up to more thanI 3,000,000 the total number of men put into Military training by the Governmeq , Including the regulars , National Guard , and national army units . A report was current late this after-noon that General Crowder , the Provost : 51arshal General , had been called upon to supply a much larger number of drafted men in April than had been expected prior to this time . When General Crowder was asked whether the quota . for the second call had been increased beyond 800,000 and he had been called upon to furnish more this month than had been contemplated , he said that he had received no new orders , and that any information regarding draft plans Would have to come from the War Department or from , Maur Gen. March , the Acting Chief of Staff . The aggregate strength of the American forces now abroad and at home , on active duty and in training camps , is between 1,300,000 and 1,600,000 men . This ' Includes regulars stationed In the Philippines , Hawaii and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches of the service , combatant , and noncombatant . Those In the insular possessions will have to be held there , and a certain proportion of the total men available ' ill have to be retained in this country , but the great , bulk of the grand total now Under arms will be sent to Europe las rapidly as possible . Steps have been ' taken to /ibtain the necessary tonnage , for their transportation . The steamers ' seised from Holland and vessels to be - obtained from France will be of considerable help in the present situation . ? Hastening Method of Movement . Originally it was the intention to send troops abroad by divisions after each division had completed its training and to forward replacement troops from time to time . There are a number of divisions now fully trained in the National Guard army and some of the draft army divisions are regarded as sufficiently trained for use in the fighting front . The London official announcement that as a result of communications and conferences among President Wilson , Secretary Baker , Generals Bliss and Pershing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last few days , " large iu , mbers of American battalions " will be sent to Europe during the " coming critical months " and " arrangements for the transportation of these additional forces are now being completed , " is interpreted as meaning that the British Government will contribute tonnage to aid in hastening the movement of treolis to Europe . There are some ' regirnents that can not be used immediately in . the formation of American divisions , and these , under the arrangement , are ' A ) be brigaded with British and French ' , nits as long as the necessity lasts . Under the decisions reached in the last week American troops are moving to the main battle front , and have been fer.the last four nays . Other American units are being put in front line trenches along parts of ' the line not involved in the . present main battle , releasing French veterans for use in the principal operations , The heavy flow of troops to France has been in progressl for several weeks , and arrangements have now been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campo for the Nerr Men . This accelerated movement will open increased facilities in the present training camps for use by men to be obtained under the new draft , and it is now understood to be the plan to place men of the second draft in the trainins  --  xamps as rapidly as the latter van accoihmodate them . The schedules called for sending about 66,000 mon into the training camps during April . This may be increased to 100,000 men . It is not the purpose to call out the entire second quota at once , but to feed large portions of this quota into the camps as fast as they can be taken care of . The suggestion has been made that additional training camp facilities might he obtained by moving Home of the green men to British training camps vacated by men sent to France , but there has ' been no official intimation that this suggestion , is considered acceptable or feasible at this time . The movement of men to France is primarily a matter of tonnage and the number of men in the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great enough to tax all available transport facilities well along Into the Summer months .
