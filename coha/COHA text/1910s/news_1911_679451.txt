txt It is a very interesting case that has been brought before the Supreme Court in Albany in connection with Contreller ? SousiER 's , plan for exempting a lot of places under him from the test of competition and probation . Among these places were those of transfer tax examiners , and application has been made by one of the examiners for an order restraining the Civil Service Commission from making such exemption . Without knowing the ground of the application , we assume that the right alleged by the examiner is that he can not under the law now be dismissed and replaced arbitrarily by the Controller and that it would be an abuse of discretion on the part of the Commission to change the rules so as to permit this . On the general principle of the Constitution and the law , there is ground for this contention . Of course it is an error to say that'a public servant , who is - in the competitive class ' is " pro ! tected " from removal whenever his superior officer thinks be has a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and give the employe an opportunity to explain That is the sole restraint imposed on- removal under the law or the rules , except for veterans . But , also , it must be'aaid that the holder of a competitive position is safer than the holder of an " . exempt position for the simple but potent reason that his.j place can not be filled at will , that his successor must stand the same tests that he did : That is an effective safeguard and was intended to be . A politician at the head of a department is in no haste to create vacancies which he can not fill to . suit himself and " the organization , " vacancies that capable . men , of differing politics or of none , might capture in spite of him . it was the purpose of the civil service law to guard the entrance to office by practical tests , and then to leave the exit quite unimpeded . Especially it was the purpose of the law in no wise to hamper the right of removal when required for the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sominn and granted by the Commission , subject to the approval of the Governor , would wholly upset the working of the law and open wide the way to gross favoritism , partiality , and abuse in appointments and in removals . That is precisely what the Constitution and the law were meant to prevent , and in the light of this purpose it very well may be that the courts will see their way to intervene . The discretion of the Commission , and for that matter that of the Governor , is limited . The Constitution seta forth plainly and comprehensively the sole qualifications for appointment in the entire civil service " merit and fitness . " It declares that these qualifications shall be ascertained by competitive examinations " so far as practicable . " The discretion of the Commission , and of the Governor , is thus sharply defined . It is confined to ascertaining and deciding whether competitive examinations in specific cases are practicable . In the class of cases now before the court the former Commission , with the approval of the then Governor , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been adopted and appointments based on them . It is clearly a matter as to which adjudication by the courts may properly be asked
