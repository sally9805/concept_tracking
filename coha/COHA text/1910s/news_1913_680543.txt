txt Railroad men and their bankers are more hopeful that the Commerce Commishion will allow a small general advance in freight rates than they have been at any time since February , 1911 , when the commission turned them a cold shoulder . At the same time some of the confident assertions made in Wall Street that the carriers have alr ... ady the assurance , or an least the intimation , from the Commission that its decision will be favorable , are pure fantasy . it is only fair to say that such reports are promptly " thrown down " by the railroad officers themselves . That the experience of three years ago will prove extremely valuable this year is the unanimous opinion-of railroad managers . The months of public hearing that they went through then taught them what the rate question really is , besides giving them no little facility in the preparation and presentation of intelligible statistics . Furthermore , the Bureau of Railway Economics at Washington is now at hand to take much of the burden of statistical work off the hands of individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the advantage as to statistical evidence , whereas three years ago they were decidedly at a disadvantage . Erroneous and misleading figures were introduced on.the side of the shippers , not always by the authorized representatives of the . shippers and probably never intentionally by anyone , which were not always as promptly exposed and refuted as they should have been . The attorney for the commission , paid by the United States Government , made himself actively the attorney for the shippers and presented some elaborate statistical tables , which had afterwards to be in part withdrawn as erroneous . An instance of the manner in which inaccurate and misleading general statistics hare been widely circulated as official , to the prejudice of the railroad case , is the comparison made in the earlier rate cases between the dividends paid in 1910 and in other years The same false comparison was innocently repeated by President Garretson before the Economic Club dinner in New York on April 29 . Mr. Garretson said that the returns of the Commerce Commission showed railroad dividends to the amount of $405,000,000 in 1910 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Statistics of Railways for 1910 , which by the way is still the latest volume of the series available , in one of its tables gives ' the dividends of the fiscal year mentioned as $405,000,000 , but this figure is the aggregate of all dividend payments of the year , regardless of whether they were paid to the public or to other railroad companies . In the same voluthe is presented an income account for all the railroads as though they were one system . thus eliminating inter-company duplications , and in this table the dividend paymenta of the same year are given as $294,000,000 , this smaller figure representing the real payment to stockholders . Comparison between 1910 and a year so far back as 1890 , moreover , ignores the fact that during and following the panit : times of 1893 more than half the railroad mileage of the country went into bankruptcy , and that in the succeeding reorganizations it great volume of funded indebtedness upon which the railroads had previously- been paying interest was converted into stock , the hoiders of which in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another consideration in the investments of the railroads in outside properties , largely coal minas , the return . on which have increased in harmony with the expansion of all industrial earnings since the early ' 90s . ? If all the railroads of the country should succeed in raising all their freight rates by 5 per cent. , the gain net earnings an this account would be 5 per cent . on approximately $2,100,000,000 , or ** a gain would scarcely put the net earnings above the level of 1910. when the yearly gross earnings were between $200 , - 000,000 and $300,000,000 less than now . Net earnings after paying taxes . for the entire country , have run for several years as follows : But it will probably be found that the advance can not be applied to all freight . If 80 per cent- can be included the railroads will be content , so that over the country the proposed advance would mean 880,000.000 to $85,000,000 greater net revenues . This is exclusive of gain due to increase in business . So far only the roads in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would mean a gain of $40,000,000 to $45,000,000 . Assuming that the railroads obtain the consent of the commission and are able to apply the 3 per cent . to not less than 80 per cent . of their freight business , the result will be additional borrowing power to the extent of $800 , - 000,000 to $1,000,000,000 for the fifty-four eastern roads , and to the extent of nearly $2,000,000,000 for all the railroads . If railroad men do not exaggerate , it would take that much to enable the railroads to catch up with the industrial procession . But the question is , will they be able to use it that way if they get more revenue . or will rates . wages and supply prices merely resume their seats in the merry-go-round.
