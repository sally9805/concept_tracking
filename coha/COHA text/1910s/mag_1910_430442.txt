A fresh reading of George Ticknor 's letters from Germany , as they appear in an attractive new edition of his " Life , Letters , and Journals , " published b ? Messrs . Houghton Mifliin Co. and provided with an Introduction by Mr. Ferris Greenslet , recalls a period in the intellectual development of this country which is full of interest for the present generation , when so many American students are earning their Ph.D . ' s in German universities . The influence of the German mind over the American mind has played so great a role in our intellectual and educational history that any facts pertaining to its establishment are of interest and value . When the time comes to measure the importance and extent of this influence , these letters of Ticknor will be a valuable source of material . It was in August , 1815 , when the young Bostonian whom Mr. Greenslet calls our first cosmopolitan scholar arrived in Gottingen , where he was to learn the real meaning of scholarship . Ticknor was , however , not the first American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave a published record of his experiences . Benjanmin Smith Barton , of Pennsylvania , later an eminent physician and author of scientific works , had preeeded him at Gottingen , and had taken his doctor 's degree there in 1799 ; also W. B. Astor of New York , and Edward Everett , whom he found there ? a his arrival , preparing himself for the Greek pro .. sorship in Harvard College . It is an interesting fact that Ticknor did not stain his first knowledge of Gottingen from any . , ne of these three countrymen , but from Madame f de Stael 's work on Germany . This famous book , which first saw the light in England in 1813 , diseovered intellectual and spiritual Germany not only for France , but for the English-speaking world as well . The pitiful ignorance of the German language and literature prevailing in this country at that time is shown by Ticknor 's account of his difficulties in of raining some preliminary knowledge of the lanz:age of the country where he had decided to study . : ' sere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : - Jamaica Plains he found an Alsatian , a teacher ' mathematics , who was willing to help him , but ho warned him that he spoke a dialect . He borwed a grammar , French and German , from Edward Everett ; sent to New Hampshire , where he fiknew there was a German dictionary , and obtained h : and after much seeking got hold of a copy of - Werther ? for a reading-book . At Gottingen the young scholar from over-seas found the leading university of Germany , if not i Europe . Founded by George the Second , the university had enjoyed the special protection of the English crown until Hanover was incorporated into estphalia under Jerome Bonaparte . While Napon was pillaging the universities of Jena , Halle , and Leipzig , he spared Gottingen , which , he declared , belonged neither to Hanover nor to Germany , but to the world . The University was equally fortunate in escaping the clutches of Jerome . Ticknor realized at once that he had entered a new world . Among the many distinguished scholars and teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mathematician , and Blumenbach the naturalist , who were attracting students from the whole of Europe . For the first time in his life , says his editor , " he was made to understand and feel what is meant by instruction ; " to know " the difference between reciting to a man and being taught by him . " In a letter to his father he thus writes of his Greek tutor Dr. Schultze : " Every day I am filled with new astonishment at the variety and accuracy , the minuteness and readiness of his learning . Every day I feel anew . . . what a mortifying distance there is between a European and an American scholar : We do not yet know what a Greek scholar is ; we do not even know the process by which a man is to be made one . Mr. Schultze is hardly older than I am . .. . It never entered into my imagination to conceive that any expense of time or talent could make a man so accomplished in this forgotten tongue as he is . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If I desired to teach anybody the value of time , I would send him to spend a semester at Gottingen . Until I began to attend the lectures , and go frequently into the streets , I had no idea of the accuracy with which it is measured and sold by the professors . Every clock that strikes is the signal for four or five lectures to begin and four or five others to close . In the intervals you may go into the streets and find they are silent and empty ; but the bell has hardly told the hour before they are filled with students , with their portfolios under their arms , hastening from the feet of one Gamaliel to those of another , ? generally running , in order to save time . . As soon as they reach the room , they take their places and prepare their pens and paper . The professor comes in almost immediately , and from that time till he goes out , the sound of his disciples taking notes does not for an instant cease . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what in all other languages is called a lesson is called in German an hour . ' You are never asked if you take lessons of such a person ; but whether you take hours ' of him .. .. Visiting , as it is done in our American colleges , is a thing absolutely unknown here . If a man , who means to have any reputation as a scholar , sees his best friend once a week , it is thought quite often enough . " The library of the university was a constant delight to the young student , as well as a reminder of the literary poverty of his own country . Speaking , after his return , of the library of Harvard College , he remarked : " When I went away , I thought it was a large library when I came back , it seemed a closetful of books . " The young barbarian from the West excited interest in the Gottingen world on his own part . Endowed by nature with rare social gifts , he was received into the homes of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Everett , he was elected to the exclusive literary club of the university , a society composed of professors and a few chosen students . In reporting this honor to his father , he writes : " We were taken in as a kind of raree-show , I suppose ,  | and we are considered , I doubt not , with much the same curiosity that a tame monkey or a dancing bear would be . We come from such an immense distance , that it is supposed we can be hardly civilized ; and it is , I am told , a matter of astonishment to many that we are white . " The young American himself may have been a " raree-show " for several distinguished visitors of the university of whom we catch glimpses in the letters . One of them was Wolf , " the corypheus of German philologists , " of whom he writes : " He was curious about our country , and questioned me about our scholars and our scholarship . I told him what I could , ? amongst other things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that he took great pleasure in reading the choruses of z'Eschylus , and that he read them without the aid of a dictionary ! I was walking with Wolf at the time , and on hearing this he stopped , squared round , and said , He told you that , did he ? ' Yes , ' I answered . Very well ; the next time you hear him say it , do you tell him he lies , and that I say so . ' " Ticknor was not in pursuit of a degree ; and after a residence of twenty months he set out again on his travels , carrying with him an unanswered letter of great moment , the offer of the professorships of the French and Spanish languages and of Belles Lettres at Harvard College . Soon after his return from Europe in 1819 , he was inducted with solemn ceremony into these new professorships . At Harvard , then a college of twenty teachers and three hundred students , Ticknor found a state of affairs which would have completely discouraged a man of less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antiquated , the discipline weak ; the governing bodies had fallen into a state of laisser faire , which made any change a slow and painful process . The reforms proposed by the new professor caused a great rattling among the dry bones at Cambridge . But the authorities had no taste for methods made in Germany , and the changes went no farther than his own department . But if Ticknor did not have the gratification of seeing many of his suggestions adopted , to him belongs the honor of giving the initial impulse to the reforms which were finally to change into a university the institution which at that time did not deserve the name of college . Mr. Greenslet calls him " the originator of the university idea in America . " Edward Everett , whom Ticknor had left behind at Gottingen , soon came home , bringing with him more German books for the Harvard library than all the rest of New England possessed . As soon as he was established as professor of Greek , one of his first acts was to urge upon the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purpose of having some promising young scholar in training abroad for service to his alma mater . The suggestion was acted upon , and the choice fell upon George Bancroft , then in his eighteenth year . After three years in Gottingen , Bancroft returned to his native country , in 1820 , with the degree of doctor of philosophy . For a year he was tutor at Harvard ; but failed to receive a permanent appointment , and was also , somewhat later , refused permission to read lectures on history after the German privat docent method , a privilege which would have been granted him in Gottingen Thus Bancroft 's efforts to introduce an important feature of the German university was unshccessfnL and the future historian of his country never lent the distinction of his name to the faculty roll of its leading university . But the would-be reformer of his college is nevertheless entitled to a place in the history of American education . With Dr. Joseph Green Cogswell , also the holder of a degree from Gottingen , he founded in 1823 , at Northampton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely based upon German ideas . After the way had been pointed out , the aspiring young scholars of America began to realize that " homekeeping youths have ever homely wits , " and to follow those pioneers in ever-increasing numbers . It is a noticeable fact that Gottingen was the shrine of most of those early pilgrimages . For the year 1829 the Book of the American Colony ( an organization which still exists ) shows the name of Longfellow followed under the rubric of " Faculty " by " Schone wissenschaft , " an excellent term for the refined learning of Ticknor 's successor at Harvard . Other distinguished names on the colony 's roll-book are Emerson and Motley . It was at Gottingen that Motley formed his famous friendship with Bismarck . Like his predecessors , he had already finished his college course at home , which fact , however , had not made him too serious-minded for the peculiar pleasures of a German fighting corps . After his death , the Iron Chancellor , in a letter to Dr. Holmes , wrote of his old corpsbruder that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he attempted original German poems and had planned a translation of Goethe 's " Faust . " In an account of those early Americans at Gottingen , mention should also le made of F. H. Hedge , whom Dr. Harris has called " the great German scholar thoroughly equipped and fully possessed of the German spirit , the German fountain among the Transcendentalists . " The reader may ask why these first Americans chose the German universities instead of Oxford and Cambridge . One would suppose , without further thought , that Oxford " with her dreaming spires " would have been the intellectual Mecca of such men as Ticknor and Longfellow . The explanation is not far to seek : the English universities have never treated foreign students with liberality ; nor did their peculiar character at the time in question permit of that universality of learning which Madame de Stael emphasized as characteristic of the universities of Germany . " Their teaching begins , " she wrote . " where that of most other nations ends . " To trace the full significance and influence of the ideas brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for study will be an important duty of the future historian of American culture .  |
