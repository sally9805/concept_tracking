The Scene is the living-room of the Fisher home . A scrupulously neat room of the late horsehair and wax flower period.At the back is the " front door , " and near it a window looking toward the street . At the left is a door leading into Marty 's bedroom , and at the right a door leading into a room sacred to Nate.Over Marty 's door is a printed sign , " Trespassers will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law . " On the right wall is a crayon portrait of Nate in G. A. R. uniform . The uniform is draped with small American flags.In the center of the room is a table with two stiff chairs beside it . There are other articles of furniture , including another small table with a drawer in it . Among the knick-knacks on the center table is a plush-covered family album.The time is about ten in the morning of a pleasant spring day.When the curtain rises the stage is empty . Immediately the street doors open and Marty peers cautiously into the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MARTY Hey ! Anybody home ? ( He listens , then goes cautiously to the door at the right , opens it , and listens again . ) Hullo , Nate ! Are y ' in there ? ( Evidently satisfied that the room is empty , he tiptoes across to the door at the left , stands before it , and raps softly and with precision . He then squats down and addresses the occupant of the room through the keyhole . ) P-s-s-s-t ! Toady ! ( Receiving no response , he looks about anxiously and again speaks into the keyhold in a slightly louder voice . ) P-s-s-s-t ! Toady ! p. 3 A SLEEPY VOICE ( from inside ) What d' you want ? MARTY Open the door . It 's me , Uncle Marty . THE VOICE Oh ! ( A bolt is shot , and Toady Fisher stands on the threshold , rubbing his eyes . Marty produces two bottles of beer and a paper bag , which he places on the center table . ) TOADY ( stretching his arms ) Oh hum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( glancing at the clock ) You took yer time about it . MARTY If I 'd snuck so much as a doughnut out of our own kitchen yer Aunt Elmira 'd been wise to us in a minute . She 's tighter than the skin on a prize pig , she is . TOADY Well , what you got ? MARTY A couple of bottles of beer and a fried egg sandwich from Hopper 's Hotel . TOADY ( examining the supplies ) Huh , is that all ? MARTY ( looking into his hat , which he takes off for the first time ) I had a pair of fried fish-cakes in the top of my hat . Guess I must have lost ' em when I tipped it to Mrs. Sprudder down by the corner . p. 4 TOADY ( pulling up a chair to the table ) Say , get me a glass and a plate , ca n't you ? MARTY ( seizing his arm ) No you do n't ; not out here . They 'll spot you sure . TOADY Rats ! Pa would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him for sixty-seven years like I have . TOADY He ca n't pin it on me that I ever seen his fifty dollars . MARTY I reckon everybody knows it left town along about the same time you did . TOADY ( beginning to eat the sandwich ) Well , I ai n't got it now , that 's a cinch . MARTY Look here , who 's running this family reconciliation , me or you ? TOADY ( his mouth full ) Aw , can the prodigal son stuff , can it . MARTY Now , Toady , do n't go and spoil it all . TOADY I would n't have stopped off in no flea-bitten burg like this , only I was sick of bumming my way on freights . All I want 's enough coin to get me to Chicago like a gentleman . MARTY You do n't know how much I 've missed you . Why , I ca n't even take a couple of drinks no more without crying . Go on in there like a good boy , and mebbe I 'll run up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to read . p. 5 TOADY ( getting up ) I give you fair warning . I ai n't going to sit in that hole all day . MARTY You 'll be safe . Even Elmira dares n't put her foot in my room . TOADY ( picking up one of the beer bottles and the sandwich and moving toward the door at the left ) Aw , all right ! All right ! MARTY I 'll steal something nice for your dinner , honest to Gawd I will . Some cold banana pudding . TOADY ( wearily ) All right ! All right ! ( Marty pushes Toady through the door and closes it . ) MARTY Now lock it on the inside . An ' do n't you open your head except I give you the high sign . TOADY ( from inside ) All right ! ( The bolt is shot . Marty listens a moment , then goes back to the center table and picks up the remaining bottle of beer just as the street door opens and Elmira Fisher enters . She has a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice ) Well , what are you doing home at this time of day ? ( Marty , startled , turns and switches the bottle of beer behind him. ) p. 6 MARTY Eh ? ELMIRA You heard what I said . MARTY So help me , I  --  ELMIRA You 've been drinking . I can smell it on you from here . MARTY That 's a nice way for a sister to talk , ai n't it ? ELMIRA I 'd like to forget I was your sister . MARTY I ai n't laying nothing in the way to hinder you trying . ( He makes a move toward the street door . ) ELMIRA Where you going now ? MARTY Mebbe I 'm going back to sweep the courthouse , and then again , mebbe I 'm going fishing . ELMIRA Fishing ! Huh ! MARTY Well , fishing 's respectable , ai n't it ? It 's mentioned in the Bible , ai n't it ? I guess that 'll hold you . The Lord said to his disciples , " Go out and dig bait , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a blaspheming good-for-nothing  --  MARTY Aw , dry up ! ELMIRA You 'll lose your job , and serve you right , too . p. 7 MARTY Need n't let that wear on your nose . I 'm a political appointee , I am . I 've got influence in Forkville . ELMIRA ( turning on him ) Influence ! You 've got influence , all right . Bad influence , that 's what you 've got . It was your influence made a thief out of your own nephew Edward and damned his immortal soul for him . MARTY I ai n't responsible for Toady . He ai n't my son . ELMIRA It do n't matter whose son he is  --  MARTY Aw , lay off ! ELMIRA What 's that you 're hiding under your coattails ? MARTY ( realizing that further concealment of the beer bottle is useless ) Just a plain bottle of beer , registered under the Pure Food Act , to contain five per cent alcohol . ELMIRA I knew it ! So that 's what you keep hidden in that pig-sty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door at the left . ) MARTY ( in alarm ) Hold on there . Where you going ? ELMIRA To bust in that door if I have to take an axe to it . I 'm going to clear this house of every drop of devil 's rum you 've had the indecency to bring into it . p. 8 MARTY ( getting between Elmira and the door ) No you do n't ! I own one-third of this house the same as you and Nate . Take a squint at that sign over my door . " Trespassers will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law . " You keep out of my place and I 'll keep out of yours . Do n't have nothing more to do with me than you can help , and I 'll return the favor , all right . But , by cricky , if you so much as set one of your flat feet acrost that sill , I 'll have a warrant out for you . ( Marty has backed up against the door , and Elmira stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnoticed in time to hear the last line . ) ELMIRA ( to Marty ) You  --  you viper ! NATE ( gruffly ) Here , what 's going on ? MARTY Howdy , Nate . I was just going out . ELMIRA It would be a God 's mercy if you 'd go for good . NATE ( coming toward the table ) It ai n't likely he 'll oblige us that far . What ca n't be helped has got to be endured . MARTY Amen ! That goes for both sides of the family . NATE ( picking up the letter from the table and peering at it ) When did this come ? p. 9 ELMIRA I just fetched it from the post-office . NATE ( feeling in his pockets ) I must have left my specks in my other coat . Here , Marty , where 's it from ? ( He hands the letter to Marty and sits down . ) MARTY ( reading from the corner of the envelope ) Fourteen eighteen F Street , Washington , D. C. NATE Huh ! ELMIRA Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a twitter . I 'm doing this . NATE Well , why do n't you open it ? ( Marty deliberately tears open the envelope and shakes out the letter . ) MARTY ( reading from the letter ) Mr. Nathan Fisher , Forkville , Indiana.Dear Sir : Our Mr. Gray has again looked into the evidence upon which you propose to base your fourth application for pension as a veteran of the Civil War , and we regret that , in our opinion , it is not sufficient to warrant us in going further with the case . The records clearly show that you were drafted into the army March 14 , 1864 , and had not left training camp at the close of hostilities.There is , however , one possibility , to which we call your attention . We understand that the Honorable Bernard P. Foss is a fellow-citizen of yours . Mr. Foss is doubtless well known to you , and if willing to bring his personal influence to bear in your behalf could undoubtedly induce the Board of Pensions to take favorable action.We herewith enclose bill for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfactory and that our suggestion in regard to Mr. Foss will prove helpful.Yours respectfullyDODSON &amp; GRIFFIN , Attorneys-at-Law. p. 10 NATE ( with bitter resignation ) That settles it , consarn ' em ! Old Foss would n't lift a finger if I was drowning . ELMIRA How much is the bill ? MARTY Eighty-seven dollars . ELMIRA The robbers ! NATE ( between his teeth ) That 's it , robbers ! The hull country 's in the hands of a bunch of dirty political crooks . If fellers like Squire Hines and Ted Wilkinson had an ounce of red-blooded patriotism they would n't stand to see a soldier of the Rebellion turned out of his nation 's history . MARTY Haw , haw ! ELMIRA You act like you seen something funny in paying out eighty-seven dollars for nothing . MARTY I reckon it takes a smarter liar than Nate to fool ' em in Washington . NATE Who 's a liar ? Ai n't I marched in every Decoration Day parade for forty years ? Ai n't I a member of the G&amp;dot ; A&amp;dot ; R&amp;dot ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deacon and an officer of the Sunday school MARTY Being a Bo's'un in the Baptist Church do n't entitle you to nothing this side of the Golden Gate . p. 11 ELMIRA You 're a low-down blaspheming likker snake . MARTY Well , as Toady used to say , mebbe it 's better to be soaked in rum than vinegar . ( Elmira begins to whimper . ) NATE I told you never to mention that scalawag 's name in this house . Ai n't it enough misfortune to be cheated out of sixteen hundred dollars back pension and a regular pension twice a month without you forever reminding me that I 'm the father of a thief ? MARTY ( glancing apprehensively at the bedroom door ) You had n't ought to be so hard and unforgiving . Like as not Toady 'll turn out a credit to the family yet . NATE ( bitterly ) I never had an ounce of comfort out of him all the days of his life , and I never expect to . MARTY Supposing he was to come home  --  I 'm only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I 'd have him in jail , that 's where I 'd have him . He 's a liar and a drunkard and a thief . There ai n't anything bad enough to call him , nothing ! MARTY Hold on ! You do n't have to yell . ELMIRA There 's Squire Hines now . p. 12 NATE Eh ! Who ? ELMIRA Squire Hines . He 's coming up the walk ! NATE ( confused between his anger at Toady and his anger over the pension ) He 's another one of ' em , damn ' em ! They 're all of a piece , conspiring to keep a man out of his rights . Darn the hull pack of ' em ! ELMIRA Nate ! NATE He 'd better keep out of here . I got scores to settle with him . MARTY You ai n't thinking of the editorial he wrote the time Toady was up for throwing the dead calf down Eben Fosdick 's well ? The one where he said the father was responsible for the sins of his son ? NATE I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cause you 'd ought n't to blame a newspaper editor for thinking things out in an uncommon way . ( There is a knock at the door . Elmira hesitates and looks at Nate . The knock is repeated . ) NATE ( to Elmira ) You heard him knock , did n't you ? ( Elmira opens the street door . Squire Hines enters pompously with his hat in his hand . The others regard him suspiciously without speaking. ) p. 13 NATE Well ? HINES Mr&amp;dot ; Fisher , sir , I realize that under ordinary circumstances I would not be a welcome visitor in your home . MARTY I guess you 're about right on that . HINES I feel , however , that in view of what has so recently and unexpectedly transpired , all petty rancors and animosities should be swept aside . I come , friends , as the bearer of sad , but glorious news , which to-night will thrill the national conscience and set the hearts of every man and woman in the State beating high with pride and sorrow . ELMIRA Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as brief as possible , my paper has just received a dispatch from the Associated Press , dated this morning . MARTY No wonder you 're excited . I bet it 's about the first time the Bugle 's had a piece of news less than a couple of days old . HINES ( impressively ) Your levity , sir , is ill-timed . The dispatch to which I refer recounts the heroic death of your brother 's only son , Edward Martin Fisher . MARTY Eh ? NATE ( taken back ) How 's that ? p. 14 ELMIRA It 's all a mistake . Toady was n't the kind to expose himself . HINES So I thought myself , Miss Fisher , but I was wrong . Toady , as you so lovingly call him , showed himself , when the crisis came , to be a man of honor fit to take his place beside the heroes of the past . MARTY ( with a glance at the bedroom ) Say , you could knock me down with a feather ! NATE Where did it happen ? HINES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Company of United States Cavalry in which your son had enlisted  --  ELMIRA Now I know it 's a mistake . Toady never rode a horse in his life . HINES ( ignoring the interruption ) I repeat , sir , his company crossed the river under a murderous fire to dislodge a party of snipers . At the very foot of the enemy 's position Edward gloriously gave up his life for our beloved flag , the first American killed . MARTY ( wiping his face with his handkerchief ) Phew ! NATE You 're sure of what you 're saying ? HINES When you have been duly informed of your bereavement by the War Department , the remains will be shipped here for interment , via El Paso , Texas . p. 15 MARTY I never was a funeral fan like Elmira , but this here corpse is one I 'll take a heap of interest looking at . ELMIRA ( to Marty ) You 're a callous , unfeeling reptile . HINES I have no wish to add to your burden of affiction , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond recognition . He was identified only by the card sewed in his uniform . MARTY ( slapping his knee as a light suddenly dawns on him ) Haw , haw , haw ! So that 's it ? ELMIRA ( seizing Marty by the collar ) So that 's what ? MARTY Take your hands off me . I got a right to be upset by my grief the same as the rest of you , ai n't I ? HINES If I may be allowed to say so , your grief ought to be somewhat tempered by the knowledge that your loss has given the youth of America an example of noble and self-sacrificing courage . NATE I knew it . MARTY Eh ? NATE Any son of mine was bound to have the right stuff in him . Yes , sir , I knew it all along . MARTY Well , I 'll be damned ! p. 16 NATE And it 's about time the nation waked up to what me and mine has done for it . HINES That 's just the point I was coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Fisher , to hold a large public demonstration of Pride and Sorrow , a military funeral , the expenses of which , I am authorized to say , will be borne jointly by the Bugle , Congressman-elect Foss , and the Honorable Theodore Q&amp;dot ; Wilkinson , our Democratic candidate for sheriff at the coming county elections . MARTY Seems to me the offer ai n't to be sneezed at . HINES To be perfectly frank , that 's the way I look at it . NATE No ! ELMIRA You mean you ai n't going to let them ? NATE They ca n't pay me off cheap and make a good thing out of it for themselves at the same time . HINES Am I to understand  --  NATE You 're to understand you ca n't make nothing off me . I 've suffered enough for my country and been disowned by it . I ai n't going to sit by and see my own son 's funeral turned into a rally for the Democratic party that would n't lift a finger to get me my just rights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family members and close personal friends attending , and if there 's any credit coming , it ai n't going to the bunch of political shysters that has turned me down . p. 17 HINES I give you my word , Mr. Fisher  --  MARTY Nate 's right for once . If he lets you pull votes for Ted Wilkinson and boom the circulation of the Bugle , there ought to be something in it besides brass bands and immortelles . NATE I 've given my own flesh and blood that might have been a comfort and a support to me in my old age . ELMIRA It 's no more'n right they should do something for him . HINES I 'm deeply pained by your attitude , deeply disappointed . MARTY It do n't seem exactly fair we should deprive the Squire of a chance to make a couple of speeches . HINES The committee are at the Bugle office now , drafting a set of resolutions which we had intended to present later in the day . I feel , however , that under the circumstances any further offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be shy about making a proposition . This ai n't a sensitive family . HINES ( to Nate ) In that case may I venture to suggest that if Mr. Foss would undertake to push your own claim for a pension , and that if the Bugle would draft and circulate a petition endorsing it ?  --  p. 18 ELMIRA Do you mean that ? MARTY There 's sixteen hundred dollars of back pension due him , according to his own reckoning . HINES I dare say the Government will not be niggardly in its recognition of your brother 's patriotic service when the facts are presented by the proper persons . NATE I ai n't saying it 's a bargain . ELMIRA If there was some way of fixing it so as Nate 's pension was mentioned in the resolutions , and Mr. Foss could n't crawl out of it afterwards . MARTY I always said that woman had ought to been a lawyer . HINES Well ? NATE Mebbe , if you could fix it like Elmira says . HINES ( glancing at his watch ) Done ! A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost his unctuousness , and the others have apparently lost sight of the gravity of the event upon which they are basing their bargain . ) I 'll be back in fifteen minutes with the committee . NATE I ai n't promising nothing yet . HINES ( genially ) That , sir , to put it vulgarly , is up to us . Good morning , all . ( He goes briskly out at the street door . Elmira goes to the window and looks after him. ) p. 19 ELMIRA ( thoughtfully ) Eighty-seven dollars from sixteen hundred  --  MARTY I never thought twenty minutes ago I 'd be the uncle of a hero and the brother of a bonyfidy pensioned veteran . ( He fills his pipe . ) ELMIRA Well , it wo n't benefit you none . You 'll pay your keep out of what you can earn for youself , same as ever . MARTY Mebbe so , and then again , mebbe not . ( He strikes a match . ) ELMIRA Do n't you dast light that pipe in here ! MARTY Aw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose an only son , without hearing you two jawing each other . MARTY Yes , and mebbe it 's a darn sight harder'n you think to lose a son like yours . ELMIRA What d' you mean by that ? MARTY There 's a little piece of business has got to be settled amongst ourselves before the Squire gets back with them resolutions . NATE ( suspiciously ) Eh ! MARTY ( going to the bedroom door and opening it ) Hey ! Come out of there . ( Toady appears in the doorway . Nate and Elmira regard him in speechless consternation. ) p. 20 TOADY Howdy , Pa . NATE ( bitterly ) So ! You was n't killed , after all ? MARTY At least his face ai n't any worse mutilated than usual . Come on , Toady ; do n't be bashful . You ai n't buried yet . ELMIRA I might have known there was some mistake . NATE Mistake nothing ! It 's a game they put up on me , the two of ' em . Yes , and Hines was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like as not . TOADY No they was n't . MARTY This here is just a quiet family funeral . ( He begins turning the pages of the family album on the table . ) NATE I 'll  --  I 'll get even with you . I 'll  --  TOADY There 's gratitude for you . ELMIRA I like your impudence . TOADY It ai n't every son has done as much for his old man as I 've done for you , pa . NATE I 'll call the constable and have you in jail.Yes , sir , and I 'll have Marty  --  MARTY You need n't pay no further attention to me . ( He extracts a photograph from the album and goes to the small table , where he opens a drawer and takes out a hammer and some tacks. ) p. 21 NATE ( to Toady ) You heard what I said . Now git ! TOADY I ai n't in no particular rush . You ca n't pin nothing on me . I 'll tell ' em Aunt Elmira swiped your fifty dollars for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of the room , climbs on it , and begins tacking up the photograph in a conspicuous place . ) ELMIRA You 're a deserter from the United States Army . They 'll get you for that , anyhow . TOADY Say , you make me laugh . When I heard old Hiny shooting off that bunk about me wading acrost the Rio Grandy with a flag in my mit , you could have butchered me with a dish rag . MARTY ( pointing with his hammer to the flags over Nate 's crayon portrait ) Will you reach me them flags , Elmira , please ? ELMIRA ( turning ) Eh ? Land of Goshen , what are you doing on my best chair . MARTY Just putting up an old photo of the dear departed for his loving relatives to admire . ( He gets down from the chair and goes for the flags himself . ) TOADY That 's right . You 'd ought to have a decorated picture of the Hero of Santa Maria . I guess you ca n't jump over Uncle Marty for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toady ) I 'm going to get to the inside of this , if I have to shake the skin off you . TOADY Hold on , will you ? I 'm busy . ( He turns to Marty , who has returned with the flags and has begun adjusting them . ) Say , Unk , you 're sticking them flags a little crooked . NATE If Hines and Foss ai n't putting up a game on me , how 'll I look when they find out ? TOADY I guess that 's something you got to figure out for yourself . NATE You 've fixed my chances for a pension . It 's a conspiracy ! ELMIRA Yes , and Marty was in it . MARTY So help me , I never laid eyes on Toady till he came tapping at my window last night . ELMIRA You need n't tell me . TOADY If you all shut up , I 'll give you the straight dope . On the level , I will . MARTY Make it short if you do n't want your pa to have apoplexy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night last winter . ELMIRA What park ? p. 23 TOADY Madison Square Park , New York City . He was a little red-headed feller with bow legs , and say , but he had a bad eye , believe me ! His name was Christian Dane O'Houlihan . ELMIRA What 's that got to do with it ? TOADY For cat 's sake , who 's telling this , me or you ? NATE Let him alone . TOADY " Gee , " I sez to him , " if I had a flossy label like yours , I bet I would n't have to be no free lunch hound . " " If you like it , " he sez , " you 're welcome to it . You ca n't do no worse with it than what I 've done . If I had a nice , plain name like Edward Martin Fisher , I 'd go and enlist in the cavalry with it . " " Go ahead , " I sez , " you 're on . " So we swapped names , and I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the red-headed feller 's getting shipped from Santa Maria , via El Paso , Texas , to be buried at the expense of the local option Democrats of Forkville , Indiana . TOADY I guess that 's about the answer . My name was more unluckier than his'n . ELMIRA What did you come back for ? Why could n't you let the only sensible thing you ever done stay done ? TOADY Oh , I got a heart , all right . I almost had a mind to light out and keep my mouth shut when I saw how puffed up Pa was over having me killed . I 'd have done it , too , only I heard you driving that bargain with Hines about my funeral . p. 24 ELMIRA Well , what do you want ? I know you want something . TOADY I give you just one guess . NATE No , sir , I do n't give him a cent . I 'll be doing my country another service by putting a crook like him behind the bars . TOADY ( cheerfully ) All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pension . MARTY You sort of owe it to the family reputation , Nate , to keep him dead . ELMIRA If your pa gives you twenty-five dollars , will you get out and leave us be ? TOADY Come around to the other ear . You do n't talk loud enough . NATE I tell you I wo n't be a party to no fraud . ELMIRA That ai n't the question . When he 's gone , we can decide what 's best according to our own conscience . MARTY I 'd like to put some money on the way ' Miry 's conscience 'll jump . ELMIRA ( to Toady , paying no attention to Marty ) Suppose he makes it fifty dollars ? TOADY What d' you take me for , a boob ? I guess I know what me and the red-headed feller has done for Pa , all right . Twenty-five per cent cash . Them 's my best terms . ( He turns and surveys the decorated portrait . ) Say , Uncle Marty , that looks swell . p. 25 ELMIRA I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four hundred dollars , or I 'll walk down the street to Hopper 's Hotel , and get drunk where the hull town 'll see me . NATE That 's a fine way for a son to talk to his father . Here 's Hines and Foss , come around to do the right thing , after ten years ' crookedness , and just when it 's all fixed up for me to get my just deserts  --  MARTY Hold on ! ELMIRA Yes , and mebbe your pa 'd have got his pension long ago , except for your carryings on , putting everybody against us . TOADY Do n't make me laugh . Everybody 's heard how Pa tried to buy a substitute when he was drafted , only he could n't raise the coin . NATE That 's a lie , you blackmailing young skunk ! TOADY I got my feelings the same as other people , and just for that word " skunk " it 'll cost you an extra hundred before I leave this house . MARTY They 'll be back here any minute with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll  --  MARTY You 'll get your regular thirty a month all the same . p. 26 NATE ( to Toady ) I 'll  --  I 'll  --  take a stick to you . I 'll beat you till there ai n't a hull bone in your carcass . ( He seizes his stick . ) TOADY All right , sail in . I could lick you with one hand , but I 'll let you beat me if you want to . ( Nate makes a move toward Toady . ) ELMIRA For the love of heaven , Nate , be careful . TOADY Only for every belt you give me I 'll holler like the Bull of Basham . We 'll have all the neighbors in here to see you basting the Hero of Santa Maria . ( Nate stands trembling with rage , the stick clutched in his hand . ) MARTY Walloping the corpse back to life 'll settle things quick enough . ( A band is heard faintly in the distance . Elmira puts her hand suddenly to her heart . ) ELMIRA Glory be ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) MARTY It 's Heinie coming back with his bandwagon load of Pride and Sorrow . TOADY ( cheerfully ) Well , Pa , what 's the good word ? p. 27 NATE You  --  you  --  TOADY I meant to be easy on you , but when they turn the courthouse corner , I 'll have to make it eight hundred for the suspense you 're causing me . NATE ( inarticulate with rage ) You 'll  --  you 'll  --  ( The music grows suddenly louder . ) MARTY There they go around the corner into Main Street . ELMIRA ( wringing her hands ) You better give in , Nate . Three-quarters is better'n nothing . TOADY It ai n't three-quarters any longer . I 've been reasonable and honest , but you 've kind of pushed me too far . I 've got to have eight hundred cold , iron dollars . ELMIRA We ai n't got four hundred to our names , let alone eight hundred . ( The band stops , and there is only the sound of the drums tapping a slow march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pa 's note for eight hundred , six months at seven per cent interest . Seven hundred to the order of Christian Dane O'Houlihan , that 's me , for services rendered , and the rest to Uncle Marty for acting as my agent . How 's that , Marty ? p. 28 MARTY Sounds fair to me . TOADY Marty can hold the notes , and if they ai n't taken up on the dot , I 'll come back and we 'll all get jugged together for defrauding the Government . MARTY ( at the window ) You better decide pretty quick , Nate . They 're almost in front of the house . NATE No , by God ! You ca n't rob a man that 's been honest all his life . I 'll  --  MARTY They 're stopping in the gate . Foss has got his plug hat on . NATE They ai n't here any too quick to suit me . I 'll have the both of you up for robbery and blackmail . ELMIRA You 'd better think what you 're doing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give , ai n't it ? ELMIRA I 'm only thinking what 's best in the end . NATE No , sir ! I 'm honest , and I 'll see you all damned before I 'll  --  TOADY ( soothingly ) It 's all right , Pa . I know you ai n't yourself . I 'm going back in Uncle Marty 's room , and if you want to go through with it , the stuff 's on . I mean it . I 'll skin out tonight and stay a corpse . ( He picks up the bottle of beer from the table . ) Of course if you want me to come and get pinched , all you got to do is call me. p. 29 NATE ( sullenly ) I ai n't saying what I 'll do . ( There is another knock . Toady goes into the bedroom and closes the door softly . Elmira goes to the street door and opens it , disclosing Foss , Hines , and Wilkinson . Foss wears a frock coat and carries a silk hat in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The three dignitaries advance into the room . Behind them is a group of neighbors framed in the doorway . Wilkinson shakes Nate by the hand rather abruptly and awkwardly . ) WILKINSON ( attempting to come at once to the point ) Howdy , Mr. Fisher .
