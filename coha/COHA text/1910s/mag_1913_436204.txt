WHEN I first came into this world the Rihbany clan experienced the usual rejoicing which comes to a Syrian clan when a man-child is born to one of its families . My kindred rejoiced at my advent , not merely because I was a son instead of a daughter , important as that was , but because I was an asset of the clan , a possible reinforcement to their fighting strength , which they had to use often against another powerful clan in the town , called Jirdak . In the Jirdak camp , however , a correspondingly great sorrow was felt . On the same night on which I was born they lost by death one of their most valiant fighters . To be so reduced in power at the same time that the enemy was reinforced with a possible fighter , seemed to the Jirdaks to be a stern heavenly visitation which it was beyond their ability to bear . But so far as I was concerned , the enemies of my people sorrowed in vain . I never lifted a finger against them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me fighting greater battles far , far away from them , but not with carnal weapons . The usual formalities were observed on the occasion of my birth . Friends , both men and women , came to our house in large numbers , into the very room where the day-old babe and its mother lay , to extend their congratulations . They brought their presents with them as did the ' Wise Men ' of old on their historic visit to Bethlehem . They sang and were exceeding glad , because unto them a child was born , a son was given . They were served with wine , coffee , and confections . I was baptized by triple immersion , in the name of the Father , Son and Holy Ghost , and thus adopted by the holy and ancient Greek Orthodox Church as one of her children . When I was forty days old , my mother being permitted again to come into the sanctuary , she carried me to the door of the church , as is the custom , where the robed priest met her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the infant Jesus , and presented me at the altar before the God of my fathers . In our family history I took rank as the fourth of a family of twelve children , five sons and seven daughters . My parents were illiterate , as were their parents before them , and the parents of their parents , for generations . My father was a stonemason , a contractor and builder . He was a man of simple , unaffected dignity , kind-hearted , remarkably industrious and devoted to his family . He was highly respected by his kindred and business associates throughout his life . He always seemed to me to be the type of man who would never willfully and designedly walk in the counsel of the ungodly , nor stand in the way of sinners , nor sit in the seat of the scornful . ' In a business way , however , he was not of the truly sagacious type . Through a wily and decidedly unscrupulous uncle of his , he became involved in certain financial transactions which kept him in debt and perpetual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of eighty . And , oh , that ' debt , ' and the ever-recurring dread ' interest ' at twelve per cent , and the thousand things which my father might have done to escape the evil designs of his uncle ! how they haunted my soul from infancy to manhood , and how I shiver and shrink even now when I recall them to mind ! Every bit of our property was taken away from us by the Frenchman ' who held the mortgage and the hated note , ' after my father had struggled for years , at least , to reduce the debt , but was prevented from doing so by the exorbitant rate of interest he was forced to pay . My mother was in some respects more richly endowed by nature than my father . I grew up to consider her the intellectual leader of the family . She possessed an alert and resourceful mind , was swift both to hear and to speak , humorous , and generous to a fault . In our family troubles we generally looked to Mother for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessed beauty of face and form , and absolute fearlessness . I never knew my mother to fear any situation , or anybody . Only the debt ' oppressed her , because it was foisted upon my father by others . Those who knew her father always testified that she inherited his fearless spirit . From description , I should judge that that grandfather of mine was such a man as Gideon , or Othniel , or Samson of the ancient leaders of Israel . His mighty voice was so heartening to his own clan in battle , and so terrifying to the enemy , that he was known to his generation as Ibrahim the Tiger . ' My mother never forgot to remind me , with great expectations , ' of the fact that I bore her father 's name . She said that his sister picked me up when I was but an hour old , kissed my doughy , wrinkly , primitive face , and named me Ibrahim ? Abraham --  but , rather fortunately , left out the tiger . ' Her action was confirmed at my baptism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not , as is sometimes the case with such women , militate against her feminine qualities . She was always a woman from the tip of her finger to the centre of her heart , and according to the fashion of her time and country an excellent housekeeper . II My father 's house was a typical , common , Syrian house . It was one story high , and consisted of two rooms , a living room and a storeroom . It was built of roughly hewn stone , ' and had one door and two windows , which had wooden shutters , without glass . The roof was the biblical earth-covered flat roof , such as the one on which Peter went up to pray in ancient Joppa . On every Syrian roof there is a stone roller , with which the dirt is rolled down and made hard enough to shed water . ' Rolling the roof ' is a daily task for the man of the house in the winter season . Failure to do this causes the roof to soften and the rain to soak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropping ' is one of the most hateful things to a Syrian household . The writer of the hook of Proverbs did not at all exaggerate the ugliness of the situation ; hen he said , ' Continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious WOIllall are alike . ' The interior of that house of my early childhood appears on the negative of my memory in this shape . On the right as you enter stands a small structure of sun-dried brick , called me ? lulaah . It is about five feet high , six feet long , and a foot deep . On the inner side it is divided into openings of different sizes , and serves the cosmopolitan purpose of a china closet , kettle cupboard , a place for father 's Turkish pipe ? narghile ? and tobacco , and whatever other little articles it may be convenient for the moment to thrust into it . The maukedah ? firepkce ? is at the forward end of this structure . It is such a fireplace as you would build at a picnic : square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , and at one side to admit the fuel . It is built of clay mixed with straw and fine quartz . There is no chimney . The smoke floats in the house with the sufferance of public opinion . The ceiling is black and shining as if it had been varnished . The earthen floor is painted frequently with red mud , and rubbed with a smooth stone until it shines . It is furnished with straw mats , cushions , and , in the water season , soft and fluffy sheepskins . There are no chairs , no bedsteads . The family sit and sleep on the floor . The bed consists of a thick cushion for a mattress , stuffed with wool or cotton , a pillow of the same material , and a quilt for a cover . So when Jesus said to the man he had healed , ' Arise , take up thy bed and walk , ' the man did not have very much to carry . In the dayt ime the beds are either rolled up , each one , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall , or put in a recess in the wall , constructed for the purpose . By the stone pillar stands the large earthen barrel of flour , on top of which is the large basin in which the bread is kept . Back , by the partition which stands between the two rooms , are two or three large , plain wooden chests which form the wardrobe for the whole family . The opposite wall contains many openings in which earthen jars , ' containing the family winter supply of dried fruits , cereals , butter , lentils , beans , crushed wheat , olives , olive-oil , molasses , rice , and other earthly comforts , are placed . By the door , on the left , there is a low wooden bench which holds the fresh-water jars , in which the women of the house carry the water from the fountain , as did the woman of Samaria whom Jesus met at Jacob 's well . There are no pictures on the whitewashed walls . The only ornaments are a shot-gun , an ammunition belt , a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which hang from wooden nails . There are no books of any kind , no musical instruments . The other room contains the wood and charcoal , tools , and so forth . My father 's house did not stand on a street , because streets are unknown to Syrian towns . There was no lawn around the house , no fence , no garden of any kind , no flower-beds . The immediate surroundings were our grove of mulberry trees , consisting of four large terraces , a terrace of grapevines , a large fig tree which bore black figs , a pomegranate tree and an apple tree . On the west side of the house we had a large climbing rosebush , which lifted its flaming top above the roof , and an alder bush , which bore blossoms of delicate texture and sweet fragrance . These bushes were permitted to share the soil with the more useful trees , not simply for resthetic delight , but because their blossoms possessed medicinal properties . At least we thought so , and thoughts are things . The houses of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our house , and had similar surroundings . III Back of our house , and extending some three hundred feet eastward , stood a row of majestic oak trees , which did not belong to us . They were perfect specimens of strength and beauty , and a real delight to the senses and the soul . But , strange as this may seem , the proximity of those trees to our house and my uncles ' houses was very displeasing to our families . In so poor a country as Syria has been for ages , objects of mere intellectual and ensthetic delight savor of vain and vexatious things . The mode of life is severely utilitarian . Only the rich and the Europeans revel in the pleasures of gardens and other great luxuries . To the masses , the only desirable possessions are those things which can be converted into bread and raiment . The owners of those oak trees were of the families more highly favored with the things of this world ; therefore they did not need the revenue which the strip of land occupied by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But our family felt differently about this matter . The oaks shaded a whole terrace of precious , silk-yielding mulberry trees for us , and some grapevines , while their mighty roots drained the soil of its substance . That was a grave situation . It meant for us loss of revenue . The mighty oaks assumed in the eyes of my people the functions of highway robbers , of enemies which never slumbered or slept and which stood at our very door . How to get rid of them was one of those family perplexities which filled my childish mind with disquieting curiosity . My father was offered much advice , gratis , as to how to kill those pernicious oaks . Not being ours , they had , of course , to be killed in some mysterious way . One of my uncles , who was of a rather grasping disposition , felt a decidedly keener antagonism toward the oaks than did my father . At times he looked and swore at them with great avidity . So far as I can remember , the first means which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer , the Oriental 's most natural speech . But , for some reason or other , prayer failed to accomplish the desired results . Then an appeal was addressed to St. John ( I do not recall whether it was the Baptist or the Evangelist ) whose con. vent was in full view from our house , farther down on the slope of the hill . He was promised three piasters ( twelve cents ) and a cruse of pure olive oil to be burned in the lamp which hung in front of his very picture . The understanding was that the saint was to show signs of death in the oaks before any payment was made ; but St. John , for reasons known only to himself , failed to rise to the occasion and do what was expected . That was a severe disappointment . However , there were other means of relief yet to be tried . My father was advised to seek a magician and have him ' blast ' the oaks by his diabolical art . The formula as I heard it stated was this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathe into it the very essence of Satan himself . Then all my father had to do was to step out in the night and sprinkle the enchanted water at the trunks of the oak trees , close to the ground , and they would wither in an incredibly short time . Fortunately for the trees , however , such magicians passed through our town only at long and uncertain interlak , and when one of them happened to be at hand , father was either absent iron ) home , or something else happened to make the moment altogether inopportune for such dangerous operations . One of our cousins urged that an appeal be made to a person having the ' es il eye . ' One having the evil eye was supposed to do great damage by just admiring an object . A fat and sweet baby , a handsome and strong man , a beautiful woman , a very fruitful tree , an abundant crop of silk cocoons , or any other good and beautiful person or thing , stood in constant danger of being injured or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother grab and run away with me ? her beautiful baby ? to the nearest hiding-place , when one who was supposed to ' strike with the eye , ' happened to be passing anywhere near our house . Certainly those oak trees were things to be admired . Then why not secure an evil-eyed person , and bribe him or her to cast upon those trees a blasting look ? However , those persons who were suspected of having the evil eye , for obvious reasons never would admit the fact , and certainly they were not in the market for hire . The last prescription to be considered , so far as I remember , for doing away with the beautiful oaks was the use of mercury . Father was told by those who knew , ' that if he would take an augur and bore a hole in any tree and then pour in the hole a small quantity of mercury ? ' live mercury ' ? the tree would die . Mercury , being very heavy in weight and of such awful , mysterious potency , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ground , course through the roots , and thus destroy all their fibres . That was a simple operation . But father was not the kind of a man to undertake it . He might resort to some impersonal agency of destruction , like prayer or magic , but to do evil himself , to destroy with his own hands , that he would not . He would not assassinate a tree any more than he would a person . So far as I know , the oak trees still stand , and wave their lofty tops over the mulberry trees and the grapevines which were forced away from us by my father 's creditors . IV It must be that the nights I was first aware of in my father 's house made deeper impressions upon my mind than the days , because they offer themselves now to my pen as the earliest bits of my conscious existence . This , I suppose , because of the fear with which they inspired me . I do not recall the time when , as a little child , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of the house , and other objects , did not frighten me whenever I looked at them . Our only source of light was a small kerosene lamp , one of the very first to come to our town after the subtle fluid of the Standard Oil Company reached Syria , shortly before my conscious life began . It was , however , a great improvement on the little olive-oil lamp , the candle ' of the Sermon on the Mount and the Ten Virgins ? an earthen saucer , with a protruding little lip curled up at one point in the rim for the wick . The lamp was placed on the edge of the mekhdaah , just above the fireplace . The corner in its immediate vicinity was reasonably well lighted , but the remoter parts of the living room were veiled with ghastly yellowish darkness . But the most vivid of my early memories of kerosene is very grim . In filling the lamp one night my sister spilled some oil on the earthen floor . In order to amuse me she told me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a match to them and they would burn quickly . As I was doing so one of the little rags fell from my hand on the floor . I thought I saw where it fell and reached down and grabbed something that looked like it . It was a scorpion ! The fiery sting pierced my flesh under the thumb nail . I rolled on the floor , a ball of quivering flesh , with a dart of the bitterest fiery pain , which never abated the whole night , reaching from my thumb to my heart . I feel no hesitancy in saying that when Rehoboam said to the people of Israel , ' My father chastised you with whips but I will chastise you with scorpions , ' he made a telling figure , and the people of that country , which is full of all manner of ' creeping things , ' must have understood him very clearly . Our nights were not tricked into cheerfulness by any of the multitude of means which delight child-life in this age and country . As a child I enjoyed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinctive , but untutored affections and protection of ' a richly endowed mother . But notwithstanding all that , and except on festive occasions , the evenings were very dreary for the little ones . There were no children 's story-books to read , and there was no one who could have read them , if any of them had fallen into our hands . No pictures for the children , and none to cheer the blankness of those whitewashed walls , which the smoke tinged with a murky hue . No toys of any kind . Now and then we fell spontaneously into a fit of laughter , or played a game of hide-and-seek in the dark corners of the room . Now and then we were favored with a tale about a miracle happening in the graveyard , or about ghosts , or wild beasts , which made the very hairs of our heads hiss with fear . Our peevishness and naughtiness had no psychological guidance . ' When bribes , which were by no means of the most persuasive kind , failed , the chief remedy was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Listen ! the hyena is coming ! Coming ! right at the door ! ! ' From the fact that men could ride on his back , we always concluded that the camel must possess at least the imitation of a human spirit . But the hyena , so terrible and so abundant in the surrounding woods and rocky hills , never failed to bring us to terms . This is why , I believe , my earliest memories of the nights in my father 's house claim precedence as I write . And as I reflect on those days now , I realize most clearly how limited , how meagrely inventive , is love without cidture . How almost helpless is sympathy without knowledge . Love is indeed the greatest thing in the world , ' but without knowledge , acquired knowledge ? real culture ? love is like a skilled workman without his tools , a mariner without his chart and compass . But the more joyful memories of those plastic years were stored in my mind in the spring and summer seasons . When the ploughman came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terraces for us , I experienced a delicious sensation . When that rough peasant arrived with his primitive plough on his right shoulder , the yoke hanging from the left shoulder , his long , hard , strong goad ? the same as the one with which Shamgar , son of Anath , slew of the Philistines six hundred men ' ? in his left hand , and his two cows , or oxen , or a cow and an on , walking before him , my childish eyes beheld a most enchanting picture . His laborer ' also came with the ploughman to break the clods behind the plough . ' Judah shall plow , and Jacoh shall break the clods . ' I would stand at a respectful distance , because of their menacing horns , and , with joyous bewilderment , watch those cows , with their eyes enlarged and their backs kinked , pull at the urging and goading of their master , turn the soil and cause the small stones and clods to roll muse tally over the terrace walls . In the latter part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' of the silkworm begin to stir with life in the muslin sack ( their winter quarters ) hanging from the ceiling . Mother takes the sack down , as sin . makes the sign of the cross and implores the divine blessing on the silk crop that is to be . The sack is opened . The t iny worms are transferred to large trays where they are fed on mulberry leaves with conscientious regularity . Holy water is secured from the priest , consecrated especially to protect the previous worms from ants and mice , and sprinkled in the house . With such a sense of security , we proceed to bestow tender and incessant care on the silkworms for forty days , at the end of nhiclr time they cease to eat and begin to spin their cocoons in the bundles of brush especially prepared for them . It is a delight to watch them build their silken houses . My eyes feast , looking at them for hours , watching the web grow from a thin haze to a heavy shell . In a week 's time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cocoons . One of the most luxurious of the bundles is given to the patron saint of the family for his gracious protection of the crop . Some choice cocoons are saved for seed , and the rest of the crop is sold to the spinners . The summer follows and I dance for joy . Our own vines and fig trees , the desire of a peaceful Israel , are laden with fruit . The delicious black figs show their African faces among the large rough green leaves . The grapes and pomegranates afford delightful . larieties . My uncle has an apricot tree near our house . He instructs me ' not to touch it , ' but I do , both for the sake of eating apricots , and to spite him . That was my father 's house in its iat ural Oct t ing and human atmosphere . That was the feeding place and shrine of my early childhood , and these are no memories of it . this trade , and the minority provide the town with its storekeepers , blacksmiths , carpenters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rocky hills which surround ElShweir are crowned with lofty pine trees , the lower slopes are covered with grapevines and fig trees , while groves of mulberry trees form the immediate environs of the town . In its depressed location El-Shweir sees but little of the outside world . Ascending to the summits of the surrounding hills , however , one beholds some of the most beautiful and sublime natural scenery in the world : the rugged and picturesque slopes of Western Lebanon , terminating in luxurious gardens at the sandy shores of the blue and dreamy Mediterranean ; the city of Beyrout , with its white buildings standing on the glittering shore like blocks of silver on a cloth of gold ; a countless number of hills and mountains , groves of pine and olive trees , winding streams , vineyards , and a multitude of towns and hamlets , nestling in the bosom of the hills in all directions as far as the eye can see . The large majority of the houses of El-Shweir were similar to our house . A few houses were two stories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no streets . Syrian towns never were built according to preconceived plans . Each man built on his own piece of land , regardless of general convenience and symmetry . One or two main roads ran winding through the town , and crooked stony footpaths , running from all directions , connected with those roads . In the rainy season the roads became streams of water , mud and slush , and pedestrians picked their way as best they could . The Orient in general has never troubled itself about sanitation , not even in the large cities . At the present time some changes for the better are gradu ally being introduced , but in my early years the country was just as Isaiah and Paul left it . Filth and refuse were thrown everywhere in the roads and around the houses . The dung-hill ' existed by every house . The people knew nothing about germs , and the germs apparently knew nothing about the people . Or rather , the germs did their utmost with the people generations ago , leaving only those who proved germ-proof . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when I was a child it was decidedly primitive . When I think of that portion of my life in comparison with my present state , I seem to myself to have traveled through the lights and shadows of two thousand years . I never knew in those days what a library was ; never saw street lights , glass windows , iron stoves , public halls , newspapers , structural iron of any kind , or anything that rolled on wheels . I had never heard the piano but once ( in the home of an American missionary ) before I came to America . Public education , citizenship , a national flag , political institutions of any description , were as unknown to me as the postulated inhabitants of Mars . VI The social life of the El-Shweir of my childhood was no less strangely interesting . As in other parts of Syria , and as in the days of Israel and Canaan , and the Jews and the Samaritans , the various clans of the town lived on terms of mutual enmity . Seldom did a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rihbany and the clan of Jirdak . To down the other clans seemed to be every clan 's ideal . This I was taught by example and precept from my infancy . Often did I hear a cousin of mine say that he would pay MY FATHER 'S HOUSE the toll-tax for every man who died in the clan of Jirdak . As clans , we lived in accordance with the precept , ' Eye for eve , tooth for tooth , burning for burning , wound for wound , ' and no fawn There was indeed social intercourse between the various clans ; there were common feasts and festivals . But all these were temporary concessions which our contiguous existence and the oneness of our religious faith required . It is not difficult to see , therefore , that under such conditions the ideal man for us was the fighter . The good man , the man wise in counsel , was indeed greatly revered , but he needed the fighter to maintain his supremacy . Of these thoughts my young soul drank its fill . Those men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me as the heights of my climbing ambition . To be like one of them was a dream which seemed to me too good to be realized . And those interclannish fights , which I witnessed in my innocent , plastic days , thrill my soul to its centre , even now , when I think of them . The sight of a few hundred men engaged in a hand-to-hand fight , shouting , cursing , swearing , and inflamed with wrath ; hundreds of women shrieking , children howling in terror ; stones , clubs , and clods flying in all directions , blood dripping from heads and faces , was indeed bewildering , overwhelming for a little soul to witness . The large majority of the men of ElShweir were absent from their homes from spring until late autumn . As a rule they left their home town right after the Easter festival , and scattered all over Syria in pursuit of their trade as stone-masons . In their travels ' in the land of the stranger ' they forgot their clannish animosities and worked and Hied together as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girdles , until their return home . Their families in the mean time lived on credit . Late in the autumn the men returned to town to spend the winter at home in complete idleness . Upon their arrival clannish animosities reasserted themselves in their hearts . Their wives , who stayed at home the year round and kept up their own feminine clannish fights , hardly allowed their returning husbands time enough to put their shoes from off their feet at the door , and their traveling bags from off their backs , before they told them of the many indignities which had been heaped upon their families in their absence , not only by the women and children of the other clan , but also by the old men who remained in the town during the summer . Thus a grave situation was immediately created , and the men made ready to ' clear for action ' on short notice . When my father came home the occasion was deliciously interesting to me . Life took on greater vigor and exhilaration . He brought with him many goodies which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' The sound of the bubbling water in his long-idle narghile , the smell of the Persian tobacco smoked in it , his manly voice , and the sense of added security which his presence gave , were choice pleasures . It was a supreme moment for me when he took down the gun from the wall to clean and oil it . I was always taught that the gun was made by Satan , and I should not touch it , but I never knew the time when I did not take awe-inspiring delight in looking at this product of Satan 's genius . The social pleasures of the people of our town were very simple and unlearned . No literary circles , no lectures , theatres , or receptions ; no **28;582;TOOLONG church suppers , or ice-cream socials to pay the minister 's salary . The social routine was very simple and most favorable to the per- petuation of the juvenile temper . Life did not radiate in broad , intellectual , : esthetic , ethical , and political highways . It had only a few hungers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town gathered in homogeneous groups and feasted themselves on gossip and tales of adventure . Eating and drinking in parties was frequent . ' Tossing the ball ' was a favorite game with the men , which , however , frequently ended in a serious fight . ' Lifting the mortar ' was another heroic feat . A wooden handle was fastened in the hollow of a large stone mortar , and the strong men vied with one another in lifting it with the right arm to the shoulder , or the full height of the arm . Rivalry in this game , also , often precipitated a fight . The game called ' Two-steps-and-ajump ' was an exciting one . A ' mark ' was placed at a certain point . The player made a short run ? ' to gather his strength ' ? until he reached the mark . Then he sprang forward with all his might , two steps and a jump . Another mark was placed where his feet last struck the ground . Thus the men strove to out-distance one another , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all others won the day . The coming of ' the bear and the monkey ' greatly excited the populace . The owner of the animals beat upon his tambourine at a certain spot in the town , to which the multitude hastened . A small sum was granted him by the authorities , out of the tax-money . He made the bear dance ' and the monkey perform antics . He sang songs , the enchanting qualities of which made the animals do certain pleasing things . But the climax of the bear-and-monkey entertainment was reached when some strong man offered to wrestle with the bear . The man comes forward . The bear , urged by his owner , stands up on his hind feet . The wild and the human beast come together . The man 's arms encircle the bear just under the armpits . The owner must see to it that the bear does not bite his antagonist . The battle is joined . The bear snorts and grunts . The man does no less . The crowd sways with every movement of the combatants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a similar manner , stiffen the resolution of the man . Such a battle can not last long . The bear grows weaker , because he has danced long before the fight . The crowd shouts . The man grips the ground with his feet and , with a last mighty push , lands upon the roaring animal ! Men rush forward , extricate the victor from the claws of the angry beast , and proclaim him hero . The owner soothes the misfortune of his vanquished pet . Playing cards was a prevalent pastime . Propounding riddles , like that which Samson propounded to the Philistines , was very popular . Ghost stories abounded . The miraculous workings of saints were often and reverently rehearsed ; the relative strength of the kings of Europe considered , mythical heroes extolled , etcetera , etcetera . VII But the chief social event of the tom n , the summit of social joy to both old and young , was the marriage feast . I always looked forward to a marriage feast as do those who watch for the morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was then that as a child I could do absolutely as I pleased . It was then that my pockets burst with plenty . Sugarplums , nuts , raisins , cakes , and other delicacies fell into my hands in great profusion . The singing , dancing , and sword-playing thrilled every nerve in me . Both in childhood and youth , El , Iiris ? marriage feast ? was to me an expression comprehensive of multitudinous joy . According to the ancient customs of t ; 1 ria , which go back to that wedding of Cana of Galilee and ages beyond it , it is not a wedding day that is appointed , but a wedding festival , which extends er several days , during which time the whole town thinks of nothing else . During the preceding week , a deputation on behalf of the bridegroom 's family , and another on behalf of the bride 's , visit all the chief homes of the carious clans in the town and notify them of the coming event . This is the equivalent of an invitation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may come . Only unfriendly clans or families are omitted and only such refuse to come , even if invited . The parable in the Gospel of St. Matthew of ' a certain king , which made a marriage fur his son , and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding , and they would not come , ' indicates this social peculiarity . The intention of the parable was to show the persistent antagonism of the Jews of the apostolic age to the Christian faith . Though they were ' called ' again and again , they would not come . To refuse an invitation to a marriage feast in Syria , excepting in case of a recent sorrow , is a sign of deep-seated enmity . His wedding day is the supremest day in a man 's life . Marriage to the Syrian Christians is not only a holy sacrament , but an ideal to which all other ideals stand subordinate . The loveliest thing a guest can say to parents at the end of a meal is , ' May we eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grooms i.e. sons . ' Matrimonial expectations are affectinnat cly expressed to boys from early childhood . Whatever service or courtesy a boy renders , he is repaid for it by saying to him , ' May we serve at your wedding ? ' The guests come to the wedding in large groups , of hundreds and of fifties , representing clans and houses . While yet a short distance from the bridegroom 's house they begin singing in groups and in diverse tunes . A large company of the groom 's clan rushes out to meet the approaching throng , with singing and shouts of joy . The two groups meet and merge together , making not only ' a joyful noise , ' but a deafening roar . They march into the house and are met by those within , with similar manifestations of joy . Presently all singing ceases . The relatives of the bridegroom stand in a straight line , with him as its centre and glory , facing their guests who have also fallen in line . The guests , speaking all together say , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allah bless you with many sons and a long life ; Our joy this day is supreme . ' To which the relatives of the bridegroom respond in similar fashion : ' May Allah bless your lives ; May such events happen in your homes ; May all your sons who are needy ( of marriage ) be so blessed and made happy . You have honored us by your coming ! ' The two parties thus give vent to their happy feelings , simultaneously causing a commotion resembling an artillery duel . Only an expert in the etiquette of the occasion is able to comprehend the meaning of the felicitations . This part of the proceedings in the marriage festivities was always most thrilling to me . So many strong men , dressed in their best and many-colored garments , formed for me a rare picture of strength and beauty . My soul expanded and contracted with the rise and fall of their mighty voices . My heart beat tumultuously as the two crowds merged together in happy confusion . My supreme care was to be at a safe distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the fearful points of those swords flashing at the head of the procession . Sunday is the last and greatest day of the wedding festivities . It is the day of the solemnizing of the marriage , and all the town is out . If the ceremony is to take place at the house , then the bride is brought to the house of the bridegroom as Rebekah was brought to Isaac 's house , where the consecration takes place . But if at the church , as is most often the case , then both the bridegroom and the bride are escorted there by the multitude . ' The bringing of the bride ' from her father 's house was a most interesting event to me as a child . Picked men are sent to bring the bride , ' thus echoing the ancient custom of strong men forcing the bride away from her kindred . If the bridegroom is to be grave and reserved in his conversation , the bride is expected to be absolutely silent while the festivities last . She is not to open her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she to close her eyes tightly . That would be humiliating crudeness . She has been instructed carefully to exercise her eyelids with lovely gentleness , until they just touch fringes , with no sign of effort , or stress . The ' drooping eyelids ' of the right kind of a bride are poetized by the Syrians as a superb example of bewitching loveliness . What seemed like an inscrutable mystery to my little mind on such an occasion , was the behavior of the bridegroom and the bride . Where did they get , all at once , such unapproachable dignity ? Were they still such people as we are ? Were they still my cousins ? It did not seem possible . I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw them a few days after the wedding conducting themselves just like other people . The bridegroom 's looks were no longer awe-inspiring . The bride 's eyes were wide open , and the output of her organs of speech seemed unlimited . Shortly after the arrival of the escorting party , who are immediately served with wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat by women attendants and the closest male friends of the bridegroom . The etiquette of the country requires that she walk out of her father 's house extreme . ly slowly . On some occasions the walk of the bride from the innermost part of the room to the door consumes about half an hour . A decorated horse or mule is at the door , on whose back she is lifted by the strong men of the party . Another mule carries the bride 's bed and clothes-chest , and the procession moves slowly toward the sanctuary , amidst great rejoicing . A large concourse of people escorts the bridegroom . When the ceremony takes place in the night , the whole affair assumes a brilliant aspect . Sword-players , singers , musicians , ' torch-bearers and other merrymakers surround the bridegroom , and are distributed also along the procession . The housetops are filed with spectators , largely women and children . They shower on the procession rose-water , flower-water , wheat ( the symbol of fecundity ) , and confections . Waves of zelagheet ? songs peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procession moles with flashing swords , flaring lamps and torches , and an indescribable din of music and song . ' Behold the bridegroom cometh ! Go ye out to meet him , ' and woe to those ' foolish virgins ' who are not ready to join the joyous throng ! The contracting parties meet at the altar , and are joined together in holy marriage by a most impressive ceremony . This done , the mighty host retraces its steps with the happy couple to the house of the bridegroom , where the chief feast of the occasion has been prepared . Food is provided for an um limited number of guests . They come from all the walks of life , from ' the highways and the hedges , ' and the house is literally filled . In the summer season the feast is spread on the housetop , but as most of the weddings occur in the winter , the guests crowd into the house , and eat and drink from an apparently unlimited supply of Syrian generosity . With this feast end the wedding festivities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my earthly life began . So distressingly homogeneous , so unmixed with higher intellec tual and ethical delights , was the life of my people . There was no higher education to rid the mind of trivialities and superstitions , and lead to the higher unity of ideals . No industry to teach the value of time and create a longing for peace . No civic spirit to convert life 's activities into ethical and social values , and lead to the love of law and order , and to cleanliness and beauty of material surroundings . Such was the home of my people when it was first introduced to my consciousness ; out of it I have traveled by devious ways to the vastly various and complex present .
