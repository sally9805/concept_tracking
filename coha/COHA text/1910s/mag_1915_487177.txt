In the following I shall venture the suggestion that the motive underlying the so-called realism is a distaste for consciousness , and especially for the humanistic implications of consciousness . I shall illustrate the point by reference to the " new realism " of recent philosophy , with a side-reference to the realism of fiction . The new realism was formally presented to the world in 1910 in the form of a " Platform " signed by six philosophers of Harvard , Columbia , and Princeton . Among the purposes of the platform was the laudable one of emancipating a bored philosophical world from a bondage of more than two centuries to the obsessions of " epistemology . " The chief of these obsessions , which we inherit both from Descartes and from Locke , is the idea that we are certainly in possession of our mental states , but only doubtfully in possession of the objects supposed to be represented by them . As a result of this obsession , we find ourselves in the position of a man who holds an elevator receipt for wheat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat or for gold , or what not  --  but which can never be made to produce anything but another representative document . Is there , then , an external or " real " world ? The question seems hopeless . Either the problem is meaningless or the assumptions need to be revised . The new realists have undertaken to revise the assumptions . But not content with destroying " epistemology " by forbidding all discussion of the theory of knowledge , the new realist extends his attack to " idealism . " Every one has use at times for some term of malediction . I have heard of a little Quaker boy who called his antagonist " a nasty little You . " A new realist would have called him an idealist . And in his view idealism is exhaustively defined in the statement that " the being of tnings is their being known . " This doctrine has usually been distinguished by philosophers as " subjective idealism . " It is also a question whether the history of philosophy affords an example of a philosopher who has subscribed without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays the part of " the idealist " in the neorealistic drama , appears to have been less interested in denying the existence of things independent of our perception than in proving that they could not be " inert " and " unthinking " things . Nor does it appear that , if we deny that the being of things is exhausted in their being known , we must affirm that being and being known are unrelated . What happens to a thing in being known is a nice and complicated question . The new realist is , however , averse to complications , and finds it simpler to leave knowledge out of the question . And since knowledge is included in the more comprehensive conception of consciousness , it will be still simpler if consciousness as such can be reduced to a position of insignificance , or , perhaps , of nonentity . This is the point at which the neo-realistic argument against idealism and epistemology is reinforced by the argument for the relational theory of consciousness . So far as I know , the origin of the relational theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bearing the suggestive title , " Does Consciousness Exist ? " It is a rather curious reflection that , while most modern philosophy assumes as beyond question that we know our states of consciousness better than we know the things of which they are conscious  --  a view which also seems inescapable to the first reflections of common-sense  --  yet few persons even pretend to tell us what a state of consciousness is . We know what a table is , but what is an idea of a table ? And how does it differ from a real table ? James answers the question by telling us that in substance there is no difference . Our experience yields us but one kind of table , which has to serve both as idea and as real table . It is then one or the other , according to its " context " or relations to other items of experience . Thus ( to change the illustration ) a pile of building material may be followed immediately by the vision of a house ; or the house may come some months later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to convert the materials into a house . In the first relation both materials and house are states of consciousness ; in the second they are objective facts . Apart from these relations , they are neither ; in the language of neo-realism , they are " neutral entities . " According to this view , consciousness  --  that is to say , you and I ? is merely one of countless possible " relations " in an impersonal world of neutral " experience . " With regard to the precise character of the consciousness-relation , neo-realistic opinion is divided ; and the variety of formulation leads one to suspect that the difficulty of defining consciousness as a relation has been slightly underestimated . By one wing , apparently the left wing , consciousness is defined , somewhat darkly , as a relation of " meaning . " The bricks and stones may actually form a house , or they may also " mean " a house  --  which appears to involve the mystical conclusion that bricks and stones have minds of their own . According to the right wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are responded to in the " specific manner " of an organism having a nervous system ; for example , to say that a brick has become part of consciousness may be only to say that somebody has picked it up . This is in accord with the new fashion of treating consciousness as " behavior . " But what may be the " specific manner " of response peculiar to living organisms , is not precisely defined . If it should turn out to be merely an intelligent manner , the work of defining the conscious relation would be still to be begun . I have in mind a lad whose mother , wishing to let him down gently , told him that , while Santa Claus was not a real person , yet the term might fitly be used to refer to the spirit of brotherly kindness supposed to pervade Christendom annually about the 25th of December . The boy 's version , as overheard later , was to the effect that Santa Claus was nothing but a " rotten old spirit . " I fear that , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neo-realists of making us nothing but rotten old relations . And they may also suspect that the term " relation " is only a pleasant way of telling us that , like Santa Claus , we really do not exist . This suspicion may be strengthened by the realistic insistence upon the point that consciousness is a rather casual relation , certainly not more significant than any other relation that might be named ; and perhaps by the subsequent reflection that the typically relational beings are the man in the moon and the bear in the heavens  --  from which the relations constituting ourselves appear to be in no wise different in kind . But if any doubt remained , it has been dispelled by Mr. Holt , who in a recent essay has told us that the mission of the neo-realists was to " abolish " this subjective nonsense about " consciousness . " How shall we explain this aversion on the part of supposedly conscious beings to the fact of their consciousness ? The answer may be found , I think , in the uncritical reverence displayed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role of the philosopher as the critic of science , the new realist aims to win intellectual reputability for philosophy by adopting the scientific point of view . Now , from the standpoint of natural science , consciousness is a peculiarly exasperating fact , a fact seriously disturbing to the scientific unity of the universe . The phenomena of animal life may plausibly be reduced to phenomena of chemical change ; and the neretro +err , . ' , In T , form all the functions of thought . But any admission that these functions are also self-conscious presents an ominous difficulty , amounting , indeed , to an admission of the supernatural . For , if the standpoint of those who are conscious be taken into account , it appears that our knowing what we do involves nothing less than an interference with the course of nature . It is therefore simpler ( and for science the simpler is always the truer ) to banish consciousness from the realm of positive facts and to treat it as an " epiphenomenon . " But it will be still simpler if consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And this is the service undertaken by the new realism . II . The new realism is philosophy in the pose of natural science . If we turn to the realistic novel , we find art in a similar pose . The roman experimental is fiction equipped with all the apparatus of scientific method , a technological vocabulary , a carefully compiled list of facts ( only the bibliography of sources is wanting ) , a disavowal of all theoretical preconception , and a sublime contempt for all human interests  --  with the honorable exception of sex . To dwell upon this aspect of realism would be to repeat much that has been admirably said in a recent article by Prof. Stuart Sherman I shall therefore content myself with pointing the analogy . Historically , the realistic novel is a protest against the older romantic novel with the happy ending  --  which was always the reward of virtue . The romantic happy ending was due , however , less to the natural productiveness of virtue than to some rather irrelevant beneficence on the part of nature or the social order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a moral order , indeed , a supernatural order Yet the supernatural is not finally disposed of by the elimination of happy chance . What if , by the exercise of moral courage , intelligence , and foresight , virtue may produce its own reward ' ? This implies the efficiency of consciousness . And this , as I have suggested , is still , from a standpoint strictly naturalistic , to admit the supernatural . Accordingly , in the strictly scientific novel , consciousness is made ineffective . Either the characters are preternaturally stupid , like the husband of Madame Bovary ( and French husbands in general ) , or they are persons of unusual intelligence whose powers of action are obstructed by introspection . In Russian realism it seems that every one who is not a clod is , like Turgenieff 's chance-acquaintance , a Hamlet ? " of the District Tschigri " or some other district . Dmitri Roudine is uncertain whether he is a hero or a humbug . Neschdanoff , in " Virgin Soil , " is a nihilist who discovers in the end that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Tolstoy 's " War and Peace , " is haunted by a constant sense of not meaning what he says . All this may it seems that in English realism intelligence is similarly inefficient , and indeed especially prone to disaster . Hardy 's " Return of the Native , " for example , is a tragedy of seemingly trivial errors . The dominant note of literary realism is the helplessness of man before the accidents of events ; and in the realistic world events always go wrong . So uniformly , indeed , as to suggest that the dice may be loaded ; or perhaps that a diabetics may have taken the place of the romantic dens ex machsna . Following the young Lucien de Rubempre through several volumes of his sordid career , we hope , of course , to see him win in the end , if only as a fair return for reading so much about him ; just as he is about to grasp success , Balzac destroys him by a single moment of self-forgetfulness . In " The Return of the Native " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a little later , the wife , Eustacia , would have been saved , had she chanced to see Yeobright 's letter . In " A Pair of Blue Eyes " we find a rejected and a repentant lover meeting on their way to a reconciliation with the same beloved , both then to be confronted with her dead body . All of this is more suggestive of a bad dream than of real life . In my own experience , the world of inexplicable mischance , in which we play the part of paralyzed spectators , is the world of nightmare . And when I note the occasions in daily life when nature and circumstance seem most overpowering and inevitable , I find that they are the times when thought is dull and the brain is weary . It strikes me as significant that much of Hardy 's world is the semi-hypnotic world of his brooding and mystical heroes , the world , not of clear consciousness , but of semi-consciousness For in waking life it seems that our consciousness of living does enable us more or less to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , as we have a clear grasp of our situation and a clear self-consciousness with regard to our motives . The world of real living is not inevitable nature , but nature more or less responsive to our purposes . Natura parendo vincltur ; by coming to terms with Nature we make use of her ; and the resultant real world is the fruit of a transaction between two parties . The fault of the happy ending of old-fashioned romanticism was not that it was happy , but only that it was gratuitous ; there was no transaction to support it . I have in mind , for example , Octave Feuillet 's " Roman d'un jeune homme pauvre " ? the story of the young and impoverished marquis who is too proud to propose to the wealthy maid while he himself is without fortune The problem seems insoluble . But happily an apparently worthless legacy turns out to be worth millions . This , of course , is merely stupid . And it is wholly unreal . Yet it is equally unreal to suppose that if man and maid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deterred by the etiquette of fortune . In real life love usually finds a way ; and the happy ending is both the logical and the natural conclusion In all by the fact that the young lady is not at home when the young man calls primed for a proposal . Obstacles are overcome by ingenuity . The task of the novelist is then to provide the ingenuity , and to make it a logical and clearly motived ingenuity . To solve the problem by a dens ex machtna or , on the other hand , to treat it as essentially insoluble  --  both courses are alike unreal . The realism that chooses the latter is no truer of actual life than the romanticism that chooses the former . Such realism describes life , not as life is , but as it ought to be from the standpoint of natural science . III . A similar situation confronts us when we return to the realism of philosophy and science . Realism claims the special support of common-sense , assuming , evidently , that common-sense is both simple and clear . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perceive that it is complicated by at least two motives . If anything is to be called real ( rather than merely imaginary ) , it must be in some sense independent of the person who perceives it ; that is , it can not be wholly his own creation . On the other hand , nothing can be called real which is not in some sense , actual or potential , a part of our immediate human experience . And an experience is called " very real " when it is a vividly conscious experience and gives us a sense of close contact with the object . Realists appear to assume that commonsense will be satisfied with exclusive emphasis upon the objective motive . Realistic science , in particular , which is the model for realistic philosophy , claims the special merit of having emancipated the objective reality from all human interpretation . The first thing that a novice in science learns is to forget that nature is offended by a vacuum or that the iron loves the magnet . Realistic science then goes further and emancipates the reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took to be color or sound is really only vibration ; that heat is really motion ; that , indeed , nothing is " really " just what it is perceived to be . This apparently solid matter turns out in the end to be a collection of countless independent atoms , which a popular imagination takes to be so many colorless ( 2. e. , gray ) microscopic billiard-balls , but concerning which it seems that science can tell us nothing that is intelligible in terms of concrete experience . But a reality wholly unrelated to experience is a little more than even realism asks . Such a reality savors of " metaphysics . " Now , therefore , we learn that science is especially distinguished by the fact that she alone keeps close to actual human experience . It now turns out , somewhat unexpectedly , that matter and energy , atoms , ether , and vibrations , were not real atoms , or what not , but only so many shorthand formulm for stating the order of events in experience . In a word , science is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this should appear to imply an abandonment of the objective principle , we are carefully informed that the character of what we perceive is wholly unrelated to the fact that we perceive it . In other words , realism , in rejecting " metaphysics , " still stands for the unvarnished fact . As I prefer to put it , realism stands for denatured human experience . For without denying that something is meant by an unvarnished fact , it strikes me that the phrase as it stands expresses a contradiction in terms . I may distinguish the fact as presented in your varnish from the fact as it appears to me , and thus , by allowing for your varnish and for mine , procure for the fact some measure of independence . But a fact without any varnish whatever seems to me , if facts are to be related to perception , to be no fact at all ; and how the world is to be described from nobody 's point of view , I can not imagine . When I try to state facts in this fashion I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the favorite philosophical illustration of a very solid fact . Yet when I attempt to describe the chair , I am confronted at once by arms , legs , seat , and back  --  terms that express a human prejudice ; and when I try to dehumanize my description , I seem to find no terms that would make the chair recognizable , none that do not seem to transform a familiar human fact into something rather " metaphysical . " And if it be objected that my way of knowing , or of describing , the chair leaves the real chair untouched , then I am compelled to wonder what that particular reality would be in a world that knew nothing of ohairs  --  in a primitive world , for example , where every one squatted . Something real , I do not doubt ; yet still something intelligible , intelligible now from the standpoint of primitive life . If an automobile would cease to be an automobile in a world without carburetors , I can not see how it could remain an automobile in a world without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be which is wholly unaltered by being known  --  to distinguish what the chair is in itself from what it becomes when known to be a chair , the cold fact from the humanly familiar and effective fact ? I seem to find nothing but that metaphysical , atomic chair  --  the chair as varnished by the scientific point of view ? which is not " really " a chair and is only doubtfully known . It seems , then , that to be a realist is not so simple a task as it appears . We live in a world which we have surely not originated , a real and not a merely imaginary world ; and , on the other hand , we live in a world which , just in being real , is more or less familiar and ( strangely ) more or less responsive to our efforts , and which , in its familiarity and responsiveness , reflects at every point our human point of view . In a word , the real world , for philosophy as well as for literature , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realism in which either of the parties is ignored is a mere pseudo-realism.
