This is the text of the inclosure in Feigl 's letter  --  the terms in which Sulzer was to indorse McCall : I have refrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action had been taken by the Designating Committee . I never thought they would name him . He is a man of absolute independence in thought and action , and no man on earth can control or dictate to him in either of these two aspects . He has but one monitor  --  his conscience . He has been my loyal and steadfast friend . Manly and open in his criticism and advice , I know the man . Those who state to the contrary as to his probable actions do not know him . I know he did not want this nomination . I am fully conisant sic where his ambitions direct . I am highly gratified at the actions of the committee . But above all I am overjoyed with Judge McCall 's consent t .. ) run , because the destiny of the city will be in safe and competent hands . , JR. , STICKS TO-IT . Answers His Family and Repeats His Charge About McCall Loan . William W. , Jr. , son Of the former Police Inspector , issued a statement last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCall headquarters concerning him . He said : " There is no denying the fact that I have a grievance against my father . That grievance is the result of two years of neglect and cruelty at his hands . He opposed my marriage to a good , if poor girl , and when I demanded that I be given back the savings from my salary as confidential attendant to Justice McCall , $4,500 accumulated at the rate of $75 a month for five years and intrusted by me to my sister , Violetta , who manages the household affairs , my father told me that I could n't have that money , as he felt It ought to go to him to reimburse hint for the money he had spent on me as a boy and youth when my Infirmity , hip disease , necessitated a succession of operations . When I lost my position as confidential attendant , owing to Judge McCall 's resignation , I again demanded my savings , and this time my father . who had not spoken to me for more than a year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been boarding in a respectable family , seeking in vain for work . My board money has been paid and I have been allowed seventy-five cents a day by my sister . I do n't drink or dissipate . " My only fault has been that I am a cripple . Since I was ordered from the house . I have ' begun a suit against my sister for the savings I entrusted to her care , and that suit is pending ' now . But I never authorized Mr. Henry Waldman , who gladly accepted a contingency retainer in this suit until he feared the power of my father 's ' influence , to divulge anything concerning our confidential relations as lawyer and client . Now , my father speaks of me as ' that poor boy , ' and , tells how he ; learned months ago from our family physician that I was suffering from pro- I gressive tuberculosis , and was an in-curable paranoiac . Strange then , that , my father should drive me from his , house , this poor , dying boy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living for seven years , and not only saved kl4 , fie0 which this affectionate father ' decided to retain to repay him for his expenses on me in previous years , but had also paid jp $25 a month to the house for my board . My father is a very wealthy man , richer than many people believe . His belated sympathy for my mental and physical condition comes rather late . " I will consent to be examined mentally by any alienists Mr. Whitman names , and am perfectly confident of the result . No one outside of one or two members of my immediate family has ever suggested that I am not fully ressessed of my mental powers . If It is true , and I am insane , then I have been very ungenerously treated by those whose duty it is to look after me . " Justice McCall has dragged in my debts . Very well . When I could n't get my own money from my father and sister , I did go in debt , just as nearly every other court clerk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , borrowing money , or buying things on the instalment plan . and giving notes for the same . Is that a crime ? Naturally when- I lost my position , and still could n't get my own money I could not repay those pending obligations . " Coming down to the subject-matter of my affidavit , I notice one thing , that both my father and Mr. McCall are very particular to limit their denials . My father says he never " advanced Justice McCall any Moneys of any kind for political or campaign purposes , " and Mr. McCall is quoted ag &frying; the same thing . " Why be so particular ? Why could n't both of them have said there never was any 21,000 obligation , that it never was repaid , that there never was any check of the New York Life for this sum paid to my father , and that my father never did deposit such a check to his private account , and never had such a check photographed ? " Two men can get together and agree that a loan between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for another purpose . But the loan speaks for itself . Now I repeat that I often heard my father tell my mother and other members of the family about this $21,000 unpaid obligation , contracted by Mr. McCall when he was seeking the Judgeship , and unpaid by him for six long years , durin ? which , as was often remarked in our family , he must have , had plenty of time and opportunity to I save enough to pay the money back . " I repeat that it was paid hack in 1008 by a check . a photograph of which I saw and handled , and that my father then spoke of its having taken six years to get the money back from McCall . Six from eight leaves two , which brings the date of that loan back to 1f ) ( 12 , and It was in that year that Edward E. McCall ran for Justice of the Supreme Court on the Tammany ticket and was elected . I think any fair-minded man can draw his own conclusions from that . " But let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was running for the Judgeship . I distinctly remember my father telling my mother of the terrible job it had been to get McCall the nomination , because McCall was so little known , and how he ( my father ) had sat up practically an entire night with Big Time ' and ' Little Tim ' Sullivan . urging upon them the advisability of getting Mr McCall the nomination and that he had only persuaded them after a lone strneele . " On account of my infirmity I did little work till Judge McCall made me his confidential attendant , a job my father had been telling me he would get Jud  --  re McCall to give me as soon as the nro law went through , giving each Judge such an appoirtment in the exemnt class . So I used to sit around the house all day , looked upon as somebody of no importance . but I kept my ears open just the same , and stored some things away In my memory that I will never forget . " But it is no use going into further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it mildly , to arise between Judge McCall and my father . I am satisfied to let the nubile judge who is telling the truth . "
