txt The three largest manufacturers of rubber goods in the United States today are U. S. Rubber , Goodyear and Goodrich . They will divide among them during the current year $500,000,000 of business . The rubber industry is now enjoying its greatest boom . Sales are limited only by the capacity of the manufacturer . U. S. Rubber in 1917 reported sales of $176,000,000 , Goodyear sales of $111,000,000 and Goodrich sales of $87,000,000 . On a basis of returns for the first five months of 1918 , U. S , Rubber will do a busine.st this year of at least $225,000,000 , Goodyear $150 , - 000,000 and Goodrich $120,000,000 . U. S. Rubber 's business may run up to 8260,000,000 and certainly will reach that figure if the concern is able to fill its requirements for crude rubber . Goodyear 's gross n:ay run above $160,000,000 . Its business for the first six months of the fiscal year , whicluended May 1 , amounted to $66,000,000 , a gain of 90% over 1917 . Continuance of this gain over the full fiscal year 1918 would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very appreciable part of the business of the rubber companies . In the case of Goodyear , the percentage is about 15% , and the other companies probably do not vary much from this figure . A year ago , the average of war business for these three concerns was less than 2% . Among the articles being manufactured by the rubber companies for the U. S. Government are truck tires , balloons of many types , gas masks , rubber boots , etc . The balloon department of Goodyear is inaldng gigantic strides and some of the dirigibles now being turned out cost $50,000 each to manufacture . The one big worry of the rubber manufacturer today is the curtailed crude rubber supply . Reduced automobile production concerns him not a bit . Manufacturers of tires are hard-pressed to take care of the demand for automobiles built up to January 1 last and capacity operations are as. - sured on this basis alone . U. S. Rubber Co. has sufficient crude on hand to assure capacity operations up to September 1 . Goodyear 's supply will probably carry the company a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiscal year . Goodrich is understood to occupy about the same position . as .1. / . S. Rubber . Probably 75% of the heavy rubber boot business of U. S. Rubber Co. is now given over to Government requirements . Much of the lighter footwear must also be put in the war classification . With increased tonnage of shipping available within a few months , and the possibility of heavy importations of guayule rubber from Mexico , rubber manufacturers say there is hope of straightening out the crude rubber situation when the pinch arrives this Fall . From a stockholder 's standpoint , the holders of securities in these three concerns have little to worry about . Over a year ago . The Wall Street Journal said that there was little chance of U. S. Rubber paying a dividend on the common stock before the end of 1918 . The company is building up a mighty surplus , and the earnings for the two years 1917 and 191S combined , applicable to the junior issue , will be in excess of the present selling price of the stock . Goodrich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its disbursements have never been more than one-third of earnings . The 9% rate appears safe . Goodyear is paying 12% on the junior issue and , with earnings in 1918 running ahead of 1917 , when $61.86 a share was shown for the common stock , the .12% rate should easily be maintained . The rapid growth of the Goodyear company recently necessitated an offering of new preferred stock amounting to $15,000,000 , of which two-thirds has already been subscribed .
