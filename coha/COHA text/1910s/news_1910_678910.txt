txt LESSONS IN ARITHMETIC . Says City Schooling In This Branch Is Inadequate . Your correspondent . Robert P. Green . should receive manifold congratulations upon the line of constructive criticism which he has taken In his articles and contributions upon the educational system of the city . The sanity of his point Of view Is decidedly refreshing after the deluge of impractical , visionary , and futile ideas with which we are visited by the professional educationists . Less education , more efficiently instilled. seems to be the necessary solution . If Mr. ' Green or if any of the school men , lack data upon the utter Inefficiency of the common school training In arithmetic , let them go into the shops and the factories where boys who have gone through the common schools are to be found , and see how many of them remember how to get the decimal equivalents of common vulgar fractions , or how many of them can add , divide , multiply , or subtract fractions . Or let them apply to the various correspondence schools which attempt to teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the correspondence schools trying to teach algebra by mall on the broken straws of a foundation supplied by what the pupil remembers of his far-off lessons in crithmette . Is it any launder that the correspondence schools have had to change and remodel and simplify the course of mathematics , and is it any wonder that they have had to change its place in the series ? What goes by the name of " education " is . In this city at least , a. fearful and wonderful thing , and it would not be recognized by some of our old schoolmasters . Mr. Green 's campaign is needed . Long may he write !
