txt The most vulnerable , vital spot of the whole German Empire is , paradoxically , in France  --  thel small city on the Meuse where the Grosses Hauptquartler , the brains of the whole German fighting organism , has been located for the last few weeks . After a lucky . lash through the forbidden zone of France held by the Germans , I managed to pay a surprise visit to the Great Headquarters , where , among other interesting sights , I have already seen the Kaiser , the King of Saxony , the Crown Prince . Major Lang-1 borne , the American Military Attache ; Field Marshal von Moltke , and shoals of lesser celebrities with which the town is overrun . My stay is of indeterminate length , and only until the polite but insistent pressure which the Kaiser 's secret police and the General Staff are bringing to bear on their unbidden guest to leave becomes irresistible .

There were long stops at every station , while unshaven . Landsturm men on . guard scanned the car windows in search of spies by the light of their electric flash lamps . After many hours somebody said we were now in Belgium . There are no longer any bothersome customs formalities at the Belgian ' border , but the ghost of a house that had been knocked into a cocked hat by a shell indicated that we were in the land of the enemy . Houses that looked as if they had been struck by a western cyclone now became more numerous : A village church steeple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours somebody else said we were in France . Every . bridge , culvert , and . crossroad was guarded by heavily bearded Landsturm men who all looked alike in their funny , antiquated high black leather helmets  --  usually in twos  --  the countryside dotted with cheery little watch fires . In the little French villages all lights were out in the houses . The streets Were barred like railroad crossings except that the poles were painted hi redwhite-black stripes , a lantern hanging from the middle of the barrier to keep the many army automobiles that passed in the night from running amuck . Sedan , ? a beehive of activity , was reached at daybreak . Here most of the Military , plus the field chaplains , got out . From here on daylight showed the picturesque ruin the French themselves had wrought  --  the frequent tangled wreckage of dynamited steel railway bridges ' sucking out of the waters of the river , piles of shattered masonry damming the current , here and there half an arch still standing of a once beautiful old stone footbridge .

Several hours more of creeping over improvised wooden bridges and restored roadbeds brought the post train to the French city that had 20,000 inhabitants before the war which the Kaiser and the Great Headquarters now occupy . Wooden signs printed in black letters , " Verboten " ( forbidden ) , now ornament the pretty little park , With its fountain still playing , outside the railroad station . The paths are guarded by picked grenadiers , not Landsturm men this time , while an officer of the guard makes his ceaseless rounds . Opposite the railroad station , on the other side of the little park , is an unpretentious villa of red brick and terra-Cotta trimmings , but two guard houses painted with redwhite-black stripes flank the front door and give it a look of importance . The street at either end is barred by red , white and black striped poles and strapping grenadiers on guard are clustered thick about it .

Its great attraction for the Kaiser , I am told , is the large secluded garden in the rear where this other " man of destiny " loves to . walk and meditate or , more usually , talk ? though the few remaining French inhabitants could have a frequent of seeing oppor-tuniti him walk in the little closed public park if they were interested , but the natives seem outwardly utterly apathetic . Servants of the Kaiser 's ' household , in green Jager uniforms , *ere loUnging around the door for an early morning : hiring , while secret service men completed the picture by hovering in the ' immediate neighborhood . You can tell that they are German secret service agents because they all wear felt alpine hats , norfolk jackets , waterproof cloth capes and a bored expression .

The Staff Near By . lust around the corner from the aCalser , within stone 's throw of his back door , is another red brick house with terra cotta trimmings  --  rather larger and more imposing . The names of its new residents , " Hahnke . " " Caprivi " and - Graf von Moltke , ? ' are scrawled in white chalk on the stone post of the gateway . Further up the same street another chalk scrawl on a quite imposing mansion informed me that " The Imperial Chancellor " and " The Foreign Office ' had set up shop there . Near by were Grand Admiral von Tirpitz 's field ' ( Wafters . A bank building on another principal street bore the sign , " War Cabinet . " The Great General Staff occupies the quaint old Hotel de Ville . An unmolested ramble showed that all the best residences and business buildings in the heart of the town were required to house the members of the Great Headquarters , who number . in addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department heads . including the Imperial Chancellor , the Car Minister , the Chief of the Great General Staff , the Chief of the ' Naval General Staff , the .

I could not help wondering why the : Allies ' aviators were n't " on the job . " A dozen , backed up by an intelligent intelligence department , could so obviously settle the fortunes of the war by blowing out the brains of their enemy . Perhaps ? that is why the whereabouts of the Great Headquarters is guarded as a jealous secret . The soldiers at the front do n't know where it is , nor the ! man on the street at home , and , of course , its location is not breathed in , the German press . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . " Visitors are not allowed ; neutral foreign correspondents are told by the authorities in Berlin that " it is Impossible " to go to the Grosser Hauptcm artier . Guard Against Air Raid . Two . aeroplane guns are mounted on the hills across the river at a point immediately opposite the Kaiser 's resilience , while near them a picked squad of sharpshooters is on the watch night and day for hostile fliers . To further safeguard , not only the person of the Kaiser , but the brains of the lighting machine , the spy hunt is kept up here With unrelenting pertinacity . We went over the town with a fine-tooth comb and cleaned out all the suspicious characters the very first day we arrived , " said a friendly detective . Thera are no cranks or anarchists left here . Today the order is going out to arrest all men of military age  --  between eighteen and forty-five  --  but there are few , if any , left . We also made a house to house search for arms and collected three wagonloads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now as he would be anywhere in Germany . We know every one who arrives and leaves town . It seems impossible for a spy to Slip in and still more to slip out again through the lines  --  but we are always on the ' watch for the impossible . The fear of spies is not a delusion or a form of madness , as you suggest Here is one %raze of my personal knowledge . A Ger'man boy scout of sixteen , who had . ; earned to speak French and English perfectly at school , volunteered his serVces and was attached to the staff of an army corps . This young chap succeeded in slipping into Rheims , where he was able to locate the positions ' of the French batteries and machine guns and make his way back to our lines with this invaluable information . For this feat the boy received the Iron Cross . After being in the field for six weeks he got homesick , however , and has been allowed to go home for a visit . " Froth a spectacular point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed patrols of ' Thiel 's , dragoons , and hussars occasionally ride through the principal streets to exercise their horses . Occasionally , too , you see a small squad of strapping grenadiers , who break into the goose step on the slightest provocation as when they pass . a General or other officer of the Great General Staff , whom you recognize by the broad red stripes on their " field gray " trousers . There is no pomp or ceremony even when royalty Is running around at large . Thus when the King ' of Saxony I arrived in town a few hours after I did . no fuss was made Whatever . The Saxon King and his staff , three touring car loads , all in field gray , drove straiget to the villa assigned them , and , after reciprocal informal visits between King and Kaiser , the former left to visit some of the battlefields on which Saxon troops had fought , and later paid visit to his troops at the front . For this exploit , the Kaiser promptly bestowed on him the Iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to town . Kaiser at the Front . Even the Kaiser 's heart is not covered with medals , nor does he wear the gorgeous white plume parade helmet nowadays , when going out for a horseback ride or a drive . I saw him come from a motor run late in the afternoon , four touring cars full of staff officers and eersonal entourage  --  and was struck by the complete absence of pomp and ' ceremony . In the second car sat the Kaiser , wearing the dirty greengray uniform of his soldiers in the field . At a distance of fifteen feet , the Over War Lord looked physically fit , but quite sober  --  an intense earnestness of expression that seemed to mirror the sternness of the times . The Kaiser goes for a daily drive or ride about the countryside usually in the afternoon , but occasionally he . is allowed to have a real outing by his solicitous entourage  --  a day and more rarely a night with his troops in the field . " His Majesty is rever so happy as when he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berlin detective told me , " If his Majesty had his way he would be among them all the time . preferably sleeping under canvas and roughing it like the rest  --  eata ing the ? simple ' food prepared by his private field kitchen . But his life is too valuable to be risked in that way , and his personal adjutant , von Plessen , who watches over MS Majesty like a mother or a governess , wo n't let him go to the front often . His Majesty loves his soldiers and would be among them right up at the firing line if he were not constantly watched and kept in check by his devoted von Plessen . " However , the Kaiser sleeps within earshot of the not very distant thunder of the German heavy artillery pounding away at Rheims , plainly heard . here at night when the wind blows from the right direction . No Sign of Cruelty . Of barba  --  ism or brutality the writer saw no signs , either here or at other French villages occupied by Germans . The behavior of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most cases kindly . There are many touches of human interest . I saw about a hundred of the most destitute hungry townsfolk mostly women with little children , hanging around one of the barracks at the outskirts of the town until after supper the German soldiers came ' out and distributed the remnants of their black bread rations to them . It is not an uncommon sight to see staff officers as well as soldiers stopping on the streets to hand out small alms to the begging women and children . Many of the shops in town were closed and boarded me At the approach of the Prussians . but small hotel keepers , cafe proprietors . and tradesmen who had the nerve to remain and keep open are very well satisfied with the German invasion in one way , for they never made so much money before in their lives .. Most of the German soldiers garrisoned here ' have picked up a few useful words of French , all of them can and do call for wine , white or red , in the vernacular . Moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonished to see - even the detectives paying real money for what they drank . Several tradesmen told me they had suffered chiefly at ? the hands of ? the French soldiers themselves ; who had helped ' - themselves freely to . their stock before retreating without paying , saying it was no use to leave good wine for the Prussian swine . I had not prowled around the great headquarters for many hours when the Secret Field Police , patrolling all the streets , showed signs of curiosity and to forestall the orthodox arrest and march to headquarters ( already experienced once , in Cologne ) waited upon Lieut . Col. von Hahnke , military commandant of the city , and secured immunity in the form of the commandant 's signature on a scrap of paper stamped in purple ink with , the Prussian eagle . Commandant Hahnke , after expressing the opinion that it was good that American newspaper men were coming to Germany to see for themselves and hoping that " the truth was beginning to become known on the other side . courteously sent his adjutant along to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and introduce me to Major Nikolai , Chief of Division III . B , in charge of newspaper correspondents and military attaches . Hei e , however , the **27;1185;TOOLONG  --  Iruimcan Pres:012111011 militarism. with the Prussian Major Nikolai In Severe . " Who are you ? What are you doing here ' : How did you get here ? " snapped the Prussian Major . A kind letter of introduction from Ambassador Gerard requesting a aU possible courtesy and ' assistance from the authorities of the countries through which he may pass , " and emblazoned with the red seal of the United States of America . which had worked like magic on all previous occasions , had no effect on Major Nikolai . Neither had a letter from the American Consul at Cologne , nor a letter of introduction to Gen. von Buelow , nor any one of a dozen other impressive documents produced in succession for his , benefit . " No foreign correspondents are permitted to be at the Great Headquarters . None have been allowed to come here . lIf we allow one to remain fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to keep an eye on all of them , " he explained . " You must go back . to Berlin at once . " Reluctant permission was finally obtained to remain one night on the possibly unwarranted intimation that the great American people would consider it a " national affront " if an American newspaperman was not allowed to stay and see the American military attache , Major Langhorne , who was away on a sightseeing tour near Verdun , but would be back in the morning . However , a long cross-examination had to be undergone at the hands of the venerable Herr Chief of the Secret Field Police Bauer , who was- taking no chances at harboring an English spy , in the Hauletguarder disguised as a correspondent . I found Major Langhorne standing the strain of the campaign well , and I gathered the impression that he intended to see the thing through , and that there was much which America could learn from the titanic operations of the Germans .

" The gardener 's daughter , ? a Pretty young Frenohwoman , the only servant who remained behind when the household fled at the approach of the Germans , is both cook and housekeeper , and whiten r arrived 1 found the seven military attaches resolved into a hoard of strategy trying to work out the important problem of securing a pure milk supply for her four-month-old baby . Work consists of occasional motor runs to various points along the long front I was told that recently Major Langhorne ran into some heavy shrapnel and shell fire , and was lucky to get away with a whole skin . When asked to tell about it , Major Langhorne passed it off laughingly as " all in the day 's work . " In spite of the fact that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for national existence , the Great General Staff has found time to give the American Military Attache every possible opportunity to see actual fighting . The foreign military- attaches have made many of their expeditions in company with the small band of German war correspondents , who live in another villa close by . under the constant chaperonage of ' Major von Rohrscheldt . They are allowed to see much but send . little . The relative position of the press in Germany is indicated by the fact that these German war correspondents are nicknamed " hunger candidates , " ? A military expert who was well . posted on American journalism explained to me , however , that the very tight censorship lid was not for the purpose Of withholding news from the German people , but to keep valuable information from being handed to the enemy . He pointed out that the laconic German official dispatches dealt only with things actually accomplished , and were very bare of detail , while . on the other hand , the French and English press had been worth more than several army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be poor journalism , but it 's the right way to make war .
