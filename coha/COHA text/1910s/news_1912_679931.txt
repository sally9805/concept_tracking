txt The I Right Hon. Winston Spencer Churchill , First Lord of the Admiralty , yesterday introduced in the House of Commons the naval estimates for the coming year . The appropriations called for amount to $220 , - 427,000 , a decrease of $1.535,000 from the amount spent last year . The First Lord accompanied the introduction with a straight talk in regard to Germany , promising the augmentation or retardation of British naval construction to correspond with Germany 's naval programme . He said he regretted the necessity of referring specifically to Germany , but continued : " The Germane are a people of robust minds , whose strong masculine good sense and high courage do not recoil from and are not offended by plain , blunt statements of fact if they are expressed with courtesy and sincerity . " Mr. Churchill then went on to tell of the conditions under which naval construction would be carried on during the next few years , prefacing his remarks by the statement that the " two to one " standard was not necessary at present , although it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard ' has been I extended by some of its supporters , " continued Mr. Churchill , " to include the Halted States , and by this means it has lost both good sense and reality . " The First Lord laid down a 60 per cent Superiority in battleships and battle cruisers of the Dreadnought type as compared with the German Navy as a convenient basis for the next four or five years . He said that Great Britain at present possessed an enormous superiority In pre-Dreadnought vessels , but as these declined in fighting value the British ratio of new construction would have ' to rise above the 60 per cent . standard . Every addition Germany made in the way of new ships would accelerate the decline in value of the pre-Dreadnought vessels and necessitate the augmentation of new British construction so as to meet the existing German naval law . Mr. Churchill said that any retardation or reduction of German construction would be promptly followed by a.proportionate measure of reduction in Great Britain . He illustrated this point by sup- , pgoosing that both countries " took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany did Pot build her proposed three ships , she Would not only save $30,000.000 or $33 , - // BRITISH NAVY PLANS DEPEND ON GERMANY // 000,000 , but her action would automatically wipe out no fewer than five British super-Dreadnoughts , which would be more than Germany could hope to do in actual warfare . Referring to the building programme , which includes four large armored ships , eight light armored cruisers , twenty destroyers , and a number of submarines , Mr. Churchill said that : $3,500,000 was to be expended on the construction of sub- , marines this year , and as regarded the light armored cruisers the Admiralty had decided to return to a smaller type of vessel , as being more useful than the recently built vessels of'the Chatham class , ( 5,400 tons . ) He said : " These light armored cruisers will be the smallest , cheapest , and fastest vessels protected with vertical armor ever projected for the British Navy . They will be strong enough and fast enough to overhaul and cut down any destroyer . " Mr. Churchill briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most anxious and most perplexing problems that the British Admiralty had ever had to solve . He recognized its enormous advantages and superiority over coal , ' continuing : " If , as is speedily promised , an internal combustion engine with sufficient power to drive warships is perfected , the advantages will be multiplied three or four times . " Whether , said Mr. Churchill , Great Britain could be sure of obtaining full supplies of oil or could accumulate and store in reserve in Great Britain sufficient for the ever-growing requirements of the navy , which supplies should be protected from both aeroplanes and other injury , was constantly engaging the attention of the Admiralty . Mr Churchill attached great importance to the development of aviation , and said'not many months would pass before regular flocks of naval aeroplanes would be attached for ordinary service to all the various squadrons and other commands . He eulogized British shipbuilding resources , which , he declared , were " largely in advance of those of - any Iother single power in the world There is therefore no danger of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - ? After reviewing the necessity for British naval preponderance , which he de , scribed as purely defensive , and pointing out that as she did not possess a great army Great Britain could not , even if she wished , menace the independence or vital interests of any great Continental State , Mr. Churchill outlined the Government 's plans to bring the existing naval reserves into a condition of greater readiness . Coder the new organization the ships available for home defense are to be divided into three fleets , comprising eight battle squadrons of eight ships each , with their attendant cruiser squadrons , torpedo boat flotillas , and all auxiliaries . An expansion of the force of destroyers and submarines was also announced by the First Lord , who said that this tepee would hereafter be placed under the control of an - Admiral of Patrols . " They Would be combined with a special new system of coast defense which would enable the battle fleets to confine themselves to their prime business of defeating the enemy 's battle fleet without icing diverted by the necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military . The First Lord &so; ** a modest democratization of the navy by the yearly promotion of twenty-five or thirty warrant officers to commissioned rank as Sub-Lieutenants . Mr. Churchill 's statement was received with a general chorus of approval . the only strongly dissenting voice was that of James Keir Hardie , who , in behalf of the Laborites , protested againset the constantly increasing naval expenditure . 11*-declared that this constituted a challenge to other powers , which they were hound to accept , and ' which eventually would lead to war . Lord Charles Beresford said that the programme did not make sufficient pro ? vision for the protection of trade routes . He regarded the mention of Germany as unnecessary ani as sure to provoke that country .
