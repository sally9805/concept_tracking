 | THE Prohibition party , for the twelfth time , is asking the American people for their suffrage . Eleven times have they refused its request , save in relatively insignificant numbers . It has never received in any election more than 265,000 votes . And yet , each successive national election it has declared its principles , nominated its candidates and repeated its demand for recognition . Were it not possest of a great moral vision , expressive of actual human need , and based upon sound principles , it would have died long since . It has lived because it has spoken the conscience of the unselfish and the altruistic . It has so stressed its dominant demand ? the abolition of the liquor traffic , and the divorcement of government , state and federal , from partnership therewith ? that those not affiliated with it have quite generally come to think of it as a party of one principle . If that were true it might well be that it still would be entitled to support , for a single principle may so hold within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's existence and ' entitle it to support . But the Prohibition party , as now constituted , is not a party of a single principle . In fact , it is the only real progressive party left in American politics . It stands for the enfranchisement of women by state and by federal action , not as a matter of expediency or as a thing inevitable ? as the Republican and Democratic parties stand for it ? but because it believes the ballot to be woman 's just due ? her inherent right . It stood for women 's enfranchisement when it cost it votes and lost it prestige . Had it been clothed with power , women would have long since been enfranchised by federal constitutional amendment . The Prohibition party stands for peace with the nations of the world ? peace with honor , peace without the surrender of a single substantial American right . It stands for the establishment of a world court of arbitral justice ? a world court with power , with authority to adjudge justiciable controversies between nations as courts now adjudge controversies between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with power it would exert its good offices for the establishment of such a court . It stands for a world police force back of the world court when established ? a police force great enough to enforce the decrees of such tribunal . It stands for the maintenance of the Monroe Doctrine inviolate . This new world has been dedicated to human freedom , and this nation in a peculiar sense is the trustee of that great right on behalf of every nation within its boundaries . The American people , however , can not claim the benefits of this doctrine and refuse to assume or discharge the responsibilities and the duties which inhere therein . If there is to be no European intervention in the affairs of any American nation under circumstances amounting to disorder and anarchy , then the security of the lives and property of European citizens living or sojourning in American nations must be assured and guaranteed by us . This duty we are performing in some instances with punctilious care , notably in Haiti and San Domingo , and in another , a more notable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have long failed , to perform it , so disregarding our obligations as to justify grave concern when , later , the nations , the property of whose citizens has been confiscated or burned , and the lives of whose citizens have been taken , demand reparation at our hands . If we owe this duty to the citizens of foreign governments living or sojourning in Mexico , we owe an even more imperative duty to protect the  | lives and property of our own citizens who live or sojourn there . In the event of a breakdown of government across the border it is the duty of this government in the interest of civilization to do whatsoever shall be necessary to establish law and order in that distracted land . We are opposed to the violation of the sovereignty of the Mexican people and would countenance no war of aggression against them . But responsible , stable government must be established there , tho armed intervention be required to establish it . THE Prohibition party stands for reasonable military preparedness , but it does not believe in militarism or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military preparedness in a single session of Congress aggregating $625 , - 000,000 is more than " an initial step " toward the preparedness required . If such preparedness is only " an initial step , " and the policy is to be adhered to and continued , the end will be the militarization of the nation . The Prohibition party stands for Americanism . But what is Americanism ? It is difficult to define ; too impalpable perhaps to be defined . But we know that no man , no set of men and no party has a monopoly of it . It is as big as the hundred million men and women who inhabit this land , who think its thoughts , vision its ideals and do its work ? as big as America . It 's the soul and heart of that common impulse that binds us together as a people , and yet goes beyond our own safety and welfare . It believes in the great world fact that all peoples are involved in a common destiny and that international peace and justice between all peoples are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , believing in our high responsibility , not only to ourselves but to all peoples , it is willing to sacrifice , if need be to the uttermost , to defend these ideals and effectuate its aspirations . For two years the nations of Europe have been at death-grips with one another . It is not strange , nor is it uncommendable , that persons born in any of those lands , but now living here , should be stirred by emotions of interest and sympathy for the land of their birth . But that such interest and such sympathy should lead them to indulge in thoughts and expressions of disrespect to the duly constituted authorities of the land of their adoption , or to deeds of conspiracy and acts of aggression against this government , is so repugnant to the spirit of loyalty that is this country 's solemn due , that it can not be tolerated , and should be , wherever and whenever it occurs , repudiated by universal public opinion and supprest by the strong hand of the Government if necessary . The Prohibition party stands for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a right to know the basis of every tariff duty levied . It stands for trade reciprocity with the nations of the world ? the reciprocity of James G. Blaine and of William McKinley . It believes in a tariff based upon scientific investigation and ascertainment , and not on partizan advantage or upon the enhancement of great and powerful corporations and combinations . Duties should be so levied and adjusted as to secure to American labor and American manufacturers such degree of protection as to equalize the difference in wages between the labor entering into any American commodity , and the labor entering into any foreign commodity with which such American commodity is compelled to compete . It stands for the creation and maintenance of an American merchant marine , but it is opposed to government ownership of ships and to the Republican policy of ship subsidies . An adequate merchant marine can be created and maintained without either the one or the other . It can be done by the admission of materials for the construction of ships free of duty , the admission to American registry of ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for transport services , by the reservation to ships of American registry of all shipping from the United States to any of its possessions and by the liberalization of harbor rules and charges and navigation laws . It stands for efficiency in the administration of the national government . The whole administrative machinery of the government should be revised by a board of non-partizan experts to the end that departmental duplication of work and responsibility may be minimized and an adequate and efficient system of supervision and accounting installed . It believes that the budget system should be adopted and that the President should be given power to veto any item in any appropriation bill . There should be an end to the extravagant and shameful misuse of public money in river and harbor and public building appropriations . It stands for arbitration of differences between capital and labor ; " for the prohibition of child labor in factories , mines and workshops ; for an eight-hour maximum day , with one day of rest in seven ; for more rigid sanitary requirements and for such working conditions as shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the protecticn of all who toil by the extension ' f employers ' liability acts ; the adoption of safety appliances for the protection of labor ; and for laws that will permit the just division of wealth which labor and capital jointly produce ; and for provision for those who suffer from industrial accident and occupational accidents and diseases . " THE Prohibition party stands committed to all these things . Taken all in all , they form a broad , progressive and comprehensive movement touching the social welfare , the economic and material interests and the civic life of the American people , and entitle it to the confidence and support of the people at the polls . But while it is committed to these things , it is convinced that they can not be fully effectuated while the alcoholic liquor traffic has governmental license and sanction . While the trade in rum exists there can be established no effective program of social justice , no real conservation of men and women , no triumph of the humanities . In a brief while , many millions of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobriety , will re-enter the industrial life of Europe . Confronted with desperate necessity , the nations there will make superhuman effort to regain the markets they have lost . If , in competition with this new , effective and insistent force , we are to retain industrial and commercial mastery , we ourselves must attain to the highest efficiency . While the traffic in alcohol survives , America can not be efficient nor its people at their best . Nor can there be adequate military preparedness . In case of war we should find what Europe has found , that greater than enemy armies is this foe of humankind . The Prohibition party , of all the political parties of America , is the only one pledged to destroy this traffic , and if given power it will keep the pledge . The Prohibition party stands for the basic , elemental right of the American people to govern themselves . This great primal right of the people is challenged by the traffic in alcoholic liquors , organized , purposeful and arrogant ? a traffic infinitely greater in its wrongs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the face of that challenge both the Republican and the Democratic  | parties are silent , both confess their inability to meet it . Ex-President Taft , in the city of Boston , before the assembled bar of the State of Massachusetts , speaking against the amendment of the Federal Constitution prohibiting the liquor traffic , made the startling statement : It would be a futile and an idle thing to amend the Federal Constitution prohibiting the liquor traffic% because the nation could not enforce the amendment if it made it . Here is a confession made by the highest representative of the Republican party , that representative constitutional government has failed in this nation . If an amendment to the Federal Constitution prohibiting the liquor traffic , or any amendment , made in the slow , thoughtful , orderly process provided by that great instrument for its amendment , representing the crystallized conviction , the purposeful will and the high resolve of the American people , can not be enforced when made , then representative constitutional government fails in this nation . There were those , and of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taft 's confession , did not believe the Republican party would accept his confession or make it its own . W E went to the National Republican Convention at Chicago and begged it to accept the challenge , begged it to make some affirmative declaration on the great issue involved . But it would not ! On the contrary , it refused , wrote a silent platform , and nominated a candidate for President who in all his life , whether as a public official or as a private citizen , has uttered no public word against the traffic or in behalf of the great basic right it challenges ? a candidate who , within the month , has toured the states of Montana and California , where state-wide fights for prohibition of the traffic are pending , and the states of Washington , Oregon and Colorado , where fights are being waged to destroy prohibition already won , and in all the trip of four thousand miles he uttered no word of encouragement or support to the struggling hosts who are fighting there to win an initial victory over this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have already won . If he will not speak in behalf of state-wide prohibition at an hour like this , when in states where the issue hangs in the balance , what right have we to expect national prohibition at his hands if we clothe him with power ? The Republican convention in Chicago refused to accept the challenge of the liquor traffic , or to commit itself in any way to national prohibition because men like Charles Warren Fairbanks , the Republican candidate for Vice-President , had packed the convention with liquor representatives . I make the charge flatly , broadly and purposefully . I challenge him to deny it . In my own city and his , the city of Indianapolis , he deliberately chose as a delegate to the Republican national convention , and as his personal representative , a wholesale liquor dealer . And a few weeks ago , on the occasion of the notification of his nomination for the Vice-Presidency , he chose as the master of ceremonies in his own home , out of all the splendid Republican personnel in. the commonwealth of Indiana , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Vice-Presidency , and his acceptance of the high honor , he has actually refused , tho it was presented to him three several times , to sign a remonstrance against the granting of license to retail intoxicating liquors in his own ward , in the city of Indianapolis ? tho he knew that if he did not sign it , he would be counted in favor of the traffic . His Jew tenant signed it . His butler signed it . But Mr. Fairbanks would not . Can you expect at the hands of this man who would not even give his name to a remonstrance against the traffic in his own ward , the national prohibition of this traffic ? THE Democratic candidates , ' Mr. Wilson and Mr. Marshall , on this first and fundamental issue , are no better . Failing to obtain affirmative action in Chicago , we went to the Democratic convention in St. Louis , and begged it to accept the cnallenge and to declare for national prohibition . But it , too , refused , wrote a silent platform , and renominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the constitutional power of the great office for three years , he has uttered no word and lifted no finger in behalf of prohibition or hinted at acceptance of the traffic 's challenge . We were recently in the State of California , where a state-wide fight is on for prohibition , and we found the enemies of prohibition ? the brewers , the winery owners ? proclaiming the President in their official publications as chief among the statesmen of the country who are opposed to prohibition and in favor of California remaining wet . We did not desire to do the President an injustice . We desired to know his attitude . And that we might know his attitude the campaign manager of the Prohibition party , on the 20th of September , sent the President the following message : You are quoted by the enemies of prohibition in California in their official publications , as chief among those opposed to prohibition . Have they any authority for so using your name ? Prohibition party special train touring the state . It will be a pleasure to announce that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you will so permit . Answer will reach us any time tomorrow , Bakersfield , California , care Prohibition special train . That was weeks ago . All this time the telegram has been in the President 's hands , but he has made no answer . His failure to , answer justifies the belief that the California wets are right , and that the President of the United States prefers that California should remain wet . Speaking in the city of Baltimore a few days after he received the telegram from Mr. Stewart , the President made a declaration which goes far to corroborate the statement of the California wets that he is opposed to prohibition : There is only one thing I have ever been ashamed of in America , and that is its timidity in face of foreign competition . Here we have it at last from the President 's own lips . He is not ashamed of the alcohol liquor traffic with its debauchery , its intimidation , its crime and its civic corruption . And he is not ashamed of the partnership between the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever curst a nation or damned a people . And the Democratic candidate for Vice-President is even worse . As Governor of the State of Indiana , he sent an executive message to the General Assembly imploring it to repeal the county local option law under which seventy-two out of the ninetytwo counties of the state had voted dry and eliminated 3000 saloons , on the ground that , as Governor of the state , he was unable to enforce the law . Upon his recommendation the law was repealed and 2000 licensed saloons returned to the state . There is blood on his hands ? a damned spot that will not out . Such are our principles , and such are our ideals . We believe in them intensely . The welfare of the nation seems to us to be indissolubly dependent upon their effectuation . We shall battle to make them the accepted principles and ideals of a majority of all the people , and in so doing we are discharging , as we believe , the highest duty that can be devolved upon the citizens of a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
