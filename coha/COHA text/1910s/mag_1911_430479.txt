 | FOR a good while before the Supreme Court of the United States rendered its fateful decision in the standard Oil Case , the probabilities of the situation had been actively canvassed in the press and at public gatherings . Wall Street had become quiet as a graveyard , uncertain whether half the stock list might not be wiped out after a little ; manufacturers everywhere were trying to reduce : heir business to the most conservative basis , not knowing how soon they might be crippled past the possibility of carrying gut their contracts . On the other hand , : he grand army of agitators to whom Wall Street is a perennial nightmare and every producing corporation a scarecrow , were bemoaning in advance the timidity of the Court and the inadequacy of the AntiTrust Law . Even the large class of sober citizens who have no speculative stakes at hazard , and whose only interest in corporations is an occasional legitimate investment in one , were more or less disturbed in mind , realizing that innocent and guilty alike would suffer from any widespread damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A crisis was approaching for which the country had been waiting ever since the enactment of the law , when it should be put to its great test , and the highest tribunal in the land should say the word by which the trust of trusts must stand or fall . In that interval of more than twenty years , every man of note who had had a share in the passage of the Act through either house of Congress had disappeared from public life ; Sherman , whose name accident had attached to it , and Hoar , who in his old age had thoughtlessly claimed credit for it , were dead . But there was one person who watched the tumult with a serene spirit . He was not afraid of the Court , for he knew it ; he was not afraid for the law , for he drew it . This was ex-Senator George F. Edmunds . The anti-trust agitation in the United States passed its thirtieth birthday last spring . In March , 1881 , while muckraking as a skilled trade was still undreamed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magazine of the strictest literary sect , famed for its staid antecedents and serious ideals , spread before its readers the " Story of a Great Monopoly , " by Henry D. Lloyd . It was a call to the American people to resist the aggressions of the most powerful industrial combination of the period , the Standard Oil Company . Its extraordinary length of more than seventeen pages challenged general notice ; its method of marshaling its facts and figures showed that its author had entered upon his task in no freakish spirit ; and its unsparing revelation of the means whereby the oil trust had been built up on the wreckage of independent concerns left nothing to guesswork . Every newspaper in the country took up the subject , using Mr. Lloyd 's article as a text . Popular preachers touched upon it in their sermons . The article was reprinted in pamphlet form for wider distribution , and busy men who rarely looked at magazines were lured into discussion of the issue it had raised . A few attempts were made to say a word in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ; the rank and file of the American people had set out to punish somebody , and were not to be diverted to a controversy . For nearly ten years the agitation continued without reaching a definitive stage . In a State here and there legislation was framed for curbing local corporations , but in most instances it was ineffective because it undertook too much , or proved its unwisdom by frightening capital away from the States concerned and into neighbor and rival States . In 1889 an opinion rendered in England by the Court of Appeal in the case of a combination of ship-owners , which had driven an independent competitor to the verge of bankruptcy , declared that the Court could not interfere with " combination and competition unaccompanied by violence or fraud or other like injurious acts , " because no statute in force makes such competition illegal . " This conclusion attracted much  | notice in the United States , and whetted the popular zest for a Federal statute against oppressive combinations , which should apply equally to all parts of the country instead of damaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later the Fifty-first Congress convened , with a Republican majority . In the campaign of the autumn before , the Republicans had promised the voters a new tariff , a new silver law , and a law against trusts . For two of these pledges the House made itself responsible ; in redemption of the other , Senator Sherman , of Ohio , seized the first working day of the session to introduce a bill " to declare unlawful trusts and combinations in restraint of trade and production . " It provided that all arrangements , contracts , agreements , trusts and combinations between persons or corporations made with a view , or which tend , to prevent full and free competition in the importation , transportation , or sale of articles imported into the United States , or in the production , manufacture , or sale of articles of domestic production or domestic raw material that competes with any similar article on which a duty is levied by the United States , or which shall be transported from one State or Territory to another , and all arrangements , contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , designed , or which tend , to advance the cost to the consumer of any such articles , are hereby declared to be against public policy , unlawful , and void . Then followed particulars as to the civil and criminal proceedings by which any participant in the unlawful traffic might be called to account . Mr. Sherman 's bill was referred to the Finance Committee , of which he was a leading member , and , after six weeks ' sojourn there , was reported out with a few verbal amendments , by which , wherever the original had emphasized the tendency of a trust 's activities , the emphasis was switched to the intention behind it . Then every Senator whose political future seemed at all uncertain felt bound to take a hand in further amending the bill , which , after receiving a gash in one place and a plaster in another , came out of the hands of its doctors in almost unrecognizable plight . It prohibited combinations between " two or more citizens or corporations , or both , " but exempted those between " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hours of their labor or of increasing their wages , " and " among persons engaged in horticulture or agriculture , made with a view of enhancing the price of their own agricu ; - tural or horticultural products . " It defined a trust as " a combination of capital , skill , or acts by two or more persons , firms , corporations or associations of persons , or of any two or more of them , " for any one or six different purposes , very minutely specified and described . And all this was followed by eleven sections designed to suppress trading in " futures " or " options " in " wheat , corn , oats , rye , barley , cotton , and all other farm products , also beef , pork , lard , and all other hog and cattle products . " After this orgy of amendment everybody paused for a night 's rest , and the next morning the bill was stretched once more upon the operating table and the Senatorial surgeons fell to work on it . Some one had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the farmers had been protected from the penalties heaped upon all other associations , the Woman 's Christian Temperance Union had been overlooked . Here was a society organized for the avowed purpose of destroying a very flourishing trade , and yet which demanded protection . True , its members had no votes , but they had plenty of men in their families whose votes they might influence . So another amendment was framed , exempting all " arrangements , agreements , associations . or combinations among persons for the enforcement and execution of the laws of any State enacted in pursuance of its police powers . " In the matter of options and futures . too , there had been reprehensible oversights . The farmer who had made a bargain to keep a neighboring livery stable supplied with oats , or a grocery with sausages , for a season , was liable to prosecution for having entered into a contract for future delivery . He must be rescued ; so the prohibition was made inapplicable to " articles to be consumed by the person to whom they are delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealousy of Senators whose constituencies were not predominantly agricultural , and ascramble followed , ending in the inclu- sion , among the commodities in which options and futures were forbidden , of stocks and bonds , cotton prints , woolen goods , steel rails , lead , salt , boots and shoes , lumber , and " all manner of intoxicating drinks . " The debate which preceded these changes was most illuminating . It was shown that under the Sherman Bill any foreign manufacturer who wished to invade this country with his goods , duty free , need merely come here and organize a trust , and immediately all the protection afforded his American competitors by the tariff would be thrown off ; that the bill aimed at punishing combination itself , rather than the wrongful acts committed by combining parties , and required , for the conviction of a culprit , that the prosecutor should prove a combination of three intents ; and that it was liable to punish harmless persons and corporations along with the obnoxious . The attempt to escape from the first of these absurdities by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another absurdity equally bad , since it left aliens free to do what Americans were forbidden to do . Having given the economic quacks all the liberty they could ask , and consumed months of valuable time in discussing kindergarten expedients to no purpose , the clearer heads wearied of the exhibition the Senate was making of itself before the country , and decided to put a stop to it . The Finance Committee had proved its incapacity for handling such a subject , so the real reformers proposed to transfer the bill to the Committee on Judiciary . This drew forth a chorus of jeers . The Judiciary Committee was headed by Mr. Edmunds , of Vermont , and contained much of the best legal talent in the Senate . Not only was it noted for the deliberation with which it moved , but again and again it had refused to report on some demagogic bill designed merely for political effect and with no sober purpose , thus sparing the Senate a blast of scorn from thoughtful citizens . Hence every Senator whom the Committee had robbed of an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slap at it in revenge . One declared that to send a bill there was to consign it to " the tomb of the Capulets . " Another pronounced the committeeroom the " grand mausoleum of Senatorial literature , " and so on . But , after the proposal had been voted down two or three times , and the Senate found itself getting into a worse and worse tangle with every renewal of debate , Senator Valthall , of Mississippi , succeeded in putting through a motion for the change of reference , with instructions to the Judiciary Committee to report within twenty days . The roll-call showed some significant divisions . Mr. Sherman voted in the negative , for obvious reasons . The unusual instructions were regarded by several Senators as casting a thinly veiled reproach upon the Committee , so nearly all who bore a grudge against it voted aye . " On the same ground a majority of the members of the Committee voted " no . " A few Senators who were open to the suspicion of not wishing any legislation at all voted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their disposition to straddle the fence on delicate questions were conveniently absent from the chamber . Instead of consuming its full allowance of twenty days , the Committee reported in six , thanks to sticking at its task both day and evening . Every member of the Committee took part in the discussion , but in the end a unanimous agreement was reached on certain fundamental propositions . One of these was that the only jurisdiction Congress had over such a matter was through its Constitutional power " to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States ; " hence any act , to be sure of passing muster with the courts , must be written around the idea of prohibiting interference with the free movement of commerce . Another was that it would be worse than idle to cumber the Act with definitions , so long as it was practicable to use terms which had a perfectly settled meaning in jurisprudence . A third and highly important consideration was that , if Congress attempted to name the various forms of combination which should be unlawful , not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover a form that had been overlooked , but this very omission would render the Act unequal ' in application , and therefore  | probably unconstitutional . These conclusions account for the generic , as opposed to specific , phraseology of the Act as we know it . Hasty critics have denounced it as vague , but that is probably because they have never studied its history and learned from what a hodgepodge it had emerged . The report of the Committee was made by Mr. Edmunds , to whom had been assigned its final drafting . It struck out everything in the pending bill after the enacting clause , and substituted the new text agreed upon . The meat of the substitute may be found in a few of its sentences , notable for their rigid simplicity : Every contract , combination in the form of trust or otherwise , or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States or with foreign nations , is hereby declared to be illegal . . . . Every person who shall monopolize , or attempt to monopolize , or combine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , any part of the trade or commerce among the several States or with foreign nations , shall be guilty of a misdemeanor . . The word " person " or " persons , " wherever used in this Act , shall be deemed to include corporations or associations existing under or authorized by the laws of either the United States , . . . any of the Territories , . . . any State , or . . . any foreign country . The rest of the Act is in amplification of these elements for technical purposes ; the prescription of penalties , and the statement of what proceedings may be employed to enforce them . The working out of all further details is left to the executive and the courts . No higher tribute could have been paid to the statesmanship which evolved such a measure from the debris of the original bill and its makeshift amendments than the fact that the Senate adopted the Edmunds substitute with but one dissenting vote , after a few hours of friendly exchange of views , in which the only pointed question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Senator who sought the distinction of standing by himself in opposition was Rufus Blodgett , of New Jersey . In the House the substitute passed without amendment , and the President signed it on the 2d of July , 1890 . So , looking over the legislative record , we find that what we know as the Sherman Act is not a Sherman act at all . Mr. Sherman had nothing whatever to do with it beyond holding a place for it on the Senate calendar by putting in an impossible bill of his ' own . If it is to be named in honor of any one , its proper title is the Edmunds Anti-Trust Act , a popular error having played upon it the same trick which christened the Allison Silver Act of 1878 the Bland Law , and the Gorman Tariff of 1894 the Wilson Law . It has never been amended , though there has been more or less legislation supplementary to it . In President Harrison 's administration , which lasted two years and eight months after it became operative , it was invoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight times ; in President McKinley 's administration , three times ; and in Presdent Roosevelt 's , forty-four times . President Taft 's score , up to the present writing , is ten bills in equity and sixteen indictments . Whatever else may be said of the law , therefore , it obviously has left no administration an excuse for inactivity . When Mr. Edmunds resigned from the Senate in 1891 , after a continuous service of twenty-five years , that body lost its most distinguished figure . There were others more picturesque , but none so well equipped in all that goes to make the ideal Senator . He was a man of few words . As an orator there was nothing notable about him except his faculty of crowding a thought into its briefest terms , uttering it in a low but very penetrating voice with none of the conventional tricks of inflection , and limiting his gestures to a somewhat monotonous up-and-down movement of a forefinger which had the same slight and scholarly bend as his shoulders . But every sentence went straight to its mark and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were watching legislation at Washington knew that his opinion of a pending measure was better worth getting than that of any of his colleagues . He had the reputation in those days of being an austere man . Really , he was a generous liver , genial among his friends , fond of good company , and an indomitable fisherman , with all that that implies . What gave him the nickname " Saint Jerome " was doubtless his white hair and beard , his spare habit and stoop , his chilly manner  | of repelling unwarranted familiarities , and his contempt for the ambitions which consumed some of the smaller minds around him . His seat in the Senate had no attractions for him apart from the opportunity it offered for shaping the laws and thus the history of the country . In that field he was unique . Matt Carpenter , of Wisconsin , when President pro tempore of the Senate , once said : " You may put me in the chair blindfolded , and I can tell whether Edmunds is in his seat by the character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is to be absent a few days , all the bills with jobs in them are brought to the front and pushed , but if he is present they are kept in the background . " And the worst that one of his ancient enemies could say of his scrutinizing practice was that " Edmunds is the largest man in little things and the littlest man in large things I ever saw . " But history may be trusted to deal fairly with the author of the anti-polygamy law , and the law fixing the manner of counting the electoral vote , as a rather large man in large things . Though a well-rooted Republican , Senator Edmunds never hesitated to unite with such Democrats as his long-time friend Senator Thurman , of Ohio , in blocking vicious legislation , or in putting through a law like the Pacific Railroad Funding Act , which saved many millions of dollars to the Government . He took the same attitude when , during the Reconstruction period , a bill was before the Senate to relieve of liability those military agents in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ordinary times ; though a new member , he boldly announced that he should vote against such discrimination unless it were limited in application to those States in which the writ of habeas corpus had been suspended . And he proved both his independence and his common sense when , though siding with Sumner and Schurz against President Grant 's scheme to annex San Domingo , and though he fought the plan to seat Pinchback by force as Governor of Louisiana , he never once severed relations with Grant . But his greatest triumph , as an apostle of patriotism before partisanship , was achieved when he won over his Democratic friends to the support of the act creating the Electoral Commission for settling the Hayes-Tilden contest . His reasoning in this instance was based on the psychology of the situation . If Congress proceeded in the regular order to count the electoral vote , it would declare Tilden elected ; on the 4th of March Grant would quite as surely recognize Hayes as the President , elected by virtue of the machinery which the Federal authority had maintained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat by agitation in the interval , would be in no condition to resist an appeal to arms , and another civil war , or at least a long and bloody mob conflict , was bound to result ; the sessions of a non-partisan or bi-partisan commission , on the other hand , giving both sides a temperate hearing , would gradually prepare the people to accept peaceably whatever conclusions were reached . No threats , no wrangling , could have won the Democrats to this plan ? it was the victory of a cool head and a tactful tongue . That a man of such mark should escape being pressed , whether by or against his preference , for the Presidency , was of course out of the question . In the Republican National Convention of 1880 he received thirty-four votes , and ninety-three in 1884 , from delegates who objected to both the leading candidates . His name was used , undoubtedly , because it would arouse , not more enthusiasm , but less antagonism , than any other , and because its owner could be trusted to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no heartburnings , whatever might happen . Since his retirement Mr. Edmunds has never relaxed his interest in public affairs . The Vermont winters being too severe for his health , he first went to Philadelphia to live , and was there called upon from time to time as leader or adviser in movements for the common welfare , like that for international arbitration , that in opposition to the war with Spain and its aftermath , that for the establishment of a stable banking and currency system , and that for the divorce of the civil service from party patronage . In all these enterprises his position was sound and sane , appealing to the judgment , and never confusing  | controversy with abuse , distorting the logical perspective , or wasting valuable energy on ills which have passed the point where they can be remedied . Of late years he has passed more.and more of his time in the gentle climate of Southern California , and this season he has been experimenting with a Pasadena summer , to decide whether he shall make that town his permanent home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind , and apparently in as good bodily condition , as he was a quarter-century ago . He reads the " Congressional Record " every day , thus keeping in close touch with our legislative history in the making , and supplements his reading with correspondence and an occasional interview with old associates in public life . About the only thing which betrays the effect of years is his handwriting , but that was always an object of criticism among his friends . The story is told of a relative who wrote him a letter of inquiry , and , after long waiting , received a response in the handwriting of an amanuensis , running on this wise : Dear Aaron : About two weeks ago I received what I suspect is a letter from you , but having been as yet unable to decipher the writing , I have not arrived at the purport of the communication , therefore can not intelligently send an answer . However , I was glad to hear from you . Love to all . Yours , GEORGE F. EDMUNDS , per C. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Yours received . I never questioned your inability to write intelligently , and , while I know I write a wretched hand , I am thankful I am not obliged to hire somebody else to write for me . Love to you and yours , A. B. M. The attainment of so ripe an age on the meager capital of health with which Mr. Edmunds started life is evidence of his force of will in holding to the rigid discipline he had to lay down for himself . As a young man he was unable to pass muster with the recruiting officers , and hence could not serve as a volunteer soldier in the Civil War . But he used to go out on the Winooski River and row to harden himself , and there has been unearthed a document of that period bearing his signature as president of a baseball club ; indicating that he was resolved not to let Nature 's handicap interfere with his doing his share of the world 's work . In the twenty-one years since the passage of the Anti-Trust Law , Mr. Edmunds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered that Mr. Edmunds led one unsuccessful fight in the Senate . This was the attempt , in 1885 , to compel President Cleveland to submit to that body his reasons for removing a Republican officeholder whose term had not yet expired . It was a tug-of-war rather than a judicial test of a President 's lawful powers , and , if I remember aright , was decided by the vote of one Republican Senator who , after all the debate , sided with the Democrats . The struggle did not affect the respect entertained by the two principals for each other ; for the President could never forget that it was Mr. Edmunds who , though his political foe , had come to him and pleaded , on grounds of the public good alone , that he should not expose his life by making an intended journey at a juncture when party feeling was running very high among the people and " cranks " with homicidal tendencies were everywhere . When all other advisers had failed , Mr. Edmunds succeeded in dissuading him . Vice-President Hendricks was dead , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one with a statutory right to act as President if Mr. Cleveland had been killed or disabled . For all that we can tell , therefore , the Senator 's patriotic intervention at this crucial moment may have saved the country from temporary anarchy .
