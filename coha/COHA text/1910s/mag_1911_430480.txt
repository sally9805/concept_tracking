 |p615  NOW that the expected has happened and Francisco I. Madero has come into his own as President of Mexico , the figure of this quondam idealist and rebel , perched upon the former seat of one of the most powerful of modern rulers , bids fair to loom much larger in the eyes of the world . What will this little man do with the momentous problems and responsibilities so unwillingly left him by his great predecessor ? Madero 's present popularity furnishes no answer to this question , for popular acclaim is notoriously fickle and untrustworthy ? above all , in Latin America . Madero 's predecessor only one short year ago was apparently the most popular hero of Latin America . Now he is a homeless outcast , and the glory of his rule is being pecked to pieces by his ingrate countrymen . In like manner Madero 's overwhelmingly triumphant election to the Presidencyy furnishes no guarantee whatever for his future . If President Madero is as wise as his present flatterers claim him to be , he will remember that the worst ruler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Presidency by the most nearly unanimous vote ever achieved by any popular candidate in Mexico . Four years later Gonzales ended his ignoble Presidential career under a cloud of universal execration and contempt . Even the children on the street spat after him as he passed by . What is left now of the one-time glorious popularity of all those former idols of Mexican acclaim ? Iturbide , Bustamente , Santa Ana , Comonfort , Miramon , Lerdo , and other favorites of the people ? Only the one name of Benito Juarez ? and he an Indian ? has emerged from all that historical ash-heap untarnished by infamy or disgrace . Yet it is an axiom of Latin-American history that the Mexican people ? ignorant , superstitious , unruly , and fickle as they have ever shown themselves to be ? never fell away from their idols of the hour until driven to it by the flagrant dishonesty , treachery , and general corruption of the rulers themselves . It is safe to predict , therefore , that Madero 's fate as a ruler depends wholly upon himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true to himself as an idealist and a reformer , or will he let himself be drawn down to the depths of those other fallen heroes of Mexico , who , starting as self-professed reformers and liberators , ended their careers as hated despots and robbers of the people ? With Madero , as with any other full-grown man , the only way to divine what he may or may not do in the future is to know for a certainty how he has borne himself in the past . What are his antecedents of race and family ? How was he reared ? Who have been his chosen friends and helpmates ? What temptations have beset him , and how did he carry himself ? How much has he suffered ? And , above all , what has he done ? President Madero , as all the world now knows , is a little man . He is barely five feet four in height , and weighs less than one hundred and thirty-five pounds . His figure is slight , his hands and feet are slender and small . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that supports it . His hair , though still brown ; is beginning to grow rather thin . Under the brown mustache can be discerned the sharp lines of a firm but delicately shaped mouth , while a fairly prominent chin is not concealed under the close-cropped beard . Were Mr. Madero an American or a man of Teuton race , he would be called dark . Being a Mexican , he is considered fair . The expression of his face is kindly and intelligent . In conversation his brown eyes light up with a quick , warm look , while his voice thrills with a note of sincerity and candor . Only at moments of stress does it rise to a high , shrill note . In a word , the general impression conveyed by Madero 's personality is that of a sympathetic figure . The Mexicans call him un muchacho sin tico a good lad . " This general verdict is confirmed by those who know him most intimately ? by his former playmates , friends of the family , and some of his more recent comrades in fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lies hidden a character of dogged perseverance , high moral and physical courage , and even fanaticism when it comes to any question of patriotism or righting wrongs.  |p616  Francisco Indalecio Madero was born on October 4 , 1873 , on the Hacienda del Rosario , one of the estates of his grandfather , the late Evaristo Madero , in the State of Coahuila , in northern Mexico . Properly speaking , he should be called Francisco Madero , Junior , since his father , the elder Don Francisco , still lives . There is still another Don Francisco Madero , a brother of the late Don Evaristo . The people of Coahuila commonly distinguished these three Franciscos of the Madero family by calling the old great-uncle Don Francisco Tio , while the father and son go by the respective diminutives of Don Pancho and Don Panchito . The mother , Dona Mercedes Gonzalez Trevino , is a daughter of the great family of landholders on the northern frontier , of which old General Trevino is the most illustrious scion . Don Panchito is the eldest of a large family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him their full support throughout the trying times of his martyrdom and the revolution . Besides all these brothers and sisters there are innumerable uncles , aunts , . cousins , and relatives by marriage , for Don Evaristo , the grandfather , was married twice and reared fourteen children . At a recent reunion of the Madero family , shortly before Don Evaristo 's death , there came together no less than 130 members of the tribe who could call each other first cousins . Almost all the members of the Madero family are well-to-do , while not a few are very rich ; for Don Evaristo not only left behind him a fortune amounting to more than $25,000,000 , but many of his children and grandchildren have contracted marriages with members of other rich hacendado families . All , with a single exception , have married Mexicans . Among them all , so the family boasts , there has never been a single drunkard or criminal . The nearest the family ever came to disgrace was when Don Panchito , on account of his political utterances , was arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family stood behind him and gave him their united support , even though some of them did not share his political enthusiasms . While Madero 's revolution was at its height it was claimed by the Diaz Government that both his father and grandfather had repudiated all of Panchito 's actions and aspirations , and that he had been formally disinherited by his grandfather ; but when Don Evaristo died , shortly before the battle of Juarez , and his will was read , this proved to be false . After the revolution had triumphed it became known that Panchito 's father had aided his son with no less than $400,000 . Other members of the family , particularly Panchito 's brothers Gustavo and Raoul and his uncle Ernesto Madero , gave sums aggregating several hundred thousand dollars . Taking into account his own private fortune staked upon the enterprise , the Madero revolution was found to have been financed for nearly a million dollars by members of the Madero family alone . During the first ten years of his early manhood young Madero devoted himself entirely to the management and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palmira , and Santa Anita , which , under his control , came to be reckoned among the richest and most productive agricultural tracts of northern Mexico . By the introduction of modern agricultural methods and a thoroughly scientific recourse to irrigation , young Francisco Madero was able to introduce and profitably to grow , not only the old accustomed Mexican products of corn , beans , tequilla , and sugar , but also olives , grapes , and raisins , the products of which , in the form of wine and olive oil , have become celebrated all over Mexico . In addition to raising such products , young Madero also took a lively interest in the mineral resources of the family estates , leading to the development by himself , together with other partners , of several rich gold and copper mines , aided by the construction of modern-built stamp mills and smelters . While devoting himself to these profitable pursuits young Madero won an enviable reputation among Mexican landholders by his wise and humane treatment of the thousands of natives employed on the vast Madero estates . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those iniquitous systems of peonage and contract labor which have so long been the curse of the poor natives of Mexico . In particular he won the affection and the loyalty of the men employed by him by an act of heroism , at one time , when he saved the lives of two of his men who were being swept away in the swollen floods of the Rio San Pedro . On this occasion Francisco Madero tore loose from the grasp of others who tried to hold him back , and , with all his clothes on , dived into the rushing flood after the drowning men . All three were swept down stream for nearly a mile , and Don  |p617  Panchito was all but drowned himself by one of the others who dragged him down with him . By the time he succeeded in pulling the second man ashore he was so spent from the violent effort that he lost consciousIn 1900 , in his twenty-seventh year , Panchito came to the city of Mexico , where his parents maintain a handsome city house , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolute character of Dona Sara , as shown during the most trying moments of the revolution , when her husband was imprisoned and became a proscribed fugitive and rebel , is believed by all those who know her intimately to have had a marked influence on the mental development and subsequent career of her husband . From this time , at all events , young Madero began to take a much livelier interest in public affairs and in the fate of his country . He himself thus describes his Like the majority of my countrymen of the better classes , I was living a tranquil life , with all my efforts spent upon my private business , and fully occupied with the thousand futilities which fill up our social life ? an existence , in short , thoroughly flat and sterile . Public affairs concerned me little , and I did not even try to take any interest in them , accustomed as I was to see how all those around me accepted things as they were in a spirit of stoic resignation . Like all the rest , I simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but selfishness . I belonged by birth to the privileged class ; my family was one of the richest and most influential in our native State ; neither I nor any other member of my family had any personal reason for lifting a hand against General Diaz , nor against his Ministers , nor against the governors of our State , nor indeed against any of our local authorities . By all these officials we were invariably treated with distinguished consideration . My criminal indifference ? a characteristic product of the times ? was subjected to a rude shock by the election massacres in Monterey on April 2 , 1903 . This tragedy , which was witnessed by some of my kinsmen and friends , who with their own eyes saw the cowardly ambuscade prepared for the independent voters of Monterey , made a most painful and lasting impression upon me . Immediately after this , Madero took up the cause of the independent voters , first in his own State of Coahuila , and afterward all over Mexico . He founded a new political organization , which he called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same name in almost every state of Mexico . With the help of these clubs he gave a new movement to Mexican politics by introducing our North American procedure of State conventions , culminating in a national convention of the new Democratic party of Mexico held at the capital . By 1905 Madero had become the - acknowledged leader of the only truly independent voters of Mexico , and he now came out openly against the Diaz Government in the gubernatorial campaign of Coahuila . When the political fight was at its height , a warrant was issued for his arrest , but before it could be executed General Diaz sent a private telegraphic order from the capital staying the warrant . Madero 's arrest at this time would have served no purpose whatsoever , since the Diaz Government had the situation so well in hand that Madero and his followers scarcely got a " look in " at the polls . After this defeat Madero went to work harder than ever to prepare for the next Presidential election in 1910 , especially when it became known that General Diaz meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up Raman Corral , one of the most discredited public men of Mexico , as his VicePresident . By way of preparing for this campaign Don Francisco wrote his now famous book , " The Presidential Succession of 1910 . " This book made a tremendous sensation in Mexico . It was published by the authorhimself at his home town of San Pedro in Coahuila , but had scarcely been issued when its sale or distribution was prohibited by the Diaz Government . The printer was cast into prison , and all copies that the Government could lay its hands on were destroyed . Madero 's book owed its sensational effect not only to the fearlessness of its attack upon the existing regime ? a thing unheard of in Mexico for over a generation ? but more still to the simplicity and clearness of its style , to its solid historical arguments , and to the manifest spirit of fairness and justice which inspired its utterances . Owing to the known spiritualistic beliefs of young Madero , it was pretended by his enemies that the book was nothing but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had confessed that he wrote the book in a series of spiritualistic trances at the dictation of one of his dead brothers . Those who circulated this silly story could never have read even the first  |p618  few pages of Madero 's book . So far from reading like a spiritualistic pamphlet , it reads rather like the dispassionate thesis of an unusually well-informed and enlightened modern historian . Even General Diaz himself must have been impressed with the fair and generous tributes paid to him for whatever was good in his Government . Thus in the chapter devoted to Porfirio Diaz we read : It was no personal or family feud , nor other enmity , which led me to write this book . As a matter of fact , I esteem General Diaz , nor can I help admiring a man who , after distinguishing himself in the defense of our country and after enjoying for more than thirty years the most absolute of powers , still bore himself with such moderation that history records but few equals . Furthermore , his private life , simple and irreproachable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of energy which enabled him to display astonishing activities . Under the able and long-continued administration of General Diaz the increase of our commerce has been fabulous ; the sources of our private and public wealth have augmented considerably ; our railway net is extending farther and farther ; our seaports have been improved with magnificent public works rendering them accessible for ships of deep draught ; our big cities have been drained , streets have been paved , and magnificent new public buildings have been erected all over the country . All this is undeniable . In the direction of progress ? economic , industrial , mercantile , agricultural , and mining ? General Diaz has done all the good for our country that he possibly could do . The best proof of our material progress and of the fact that our national finances are in an admirable condition is to be found in the circumstance that the income from our exports in the form of customs and taxes far exceeds the interest on our national debt ; which has increased considerably under the Diaz Administration . This is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idealist blinded by political passion . Having thus rendered unto Caesar what was due to Cmsar , the author was all the better able to arraign the faults and past crimes of Diaz 's Government in a way that was at once terrible and convincing . Inasmuch as Madero 's book was almost totally suppressed by General Diaz , its effect , apart from making Madero a marked man , was all but negative so far as the political campaign of 1910 was concerned . Still , some of its seed fell on good ground , and the reputation for fearlessness that it gave to its author placed Madero in the front rank as the only candidate for the Presidency bold enough to run against Diaz . For a short while General Diaz tolerated this opposition candidacy , but as soon as Madero began to travel about the country organizing anti-Government clubs and making open speeches against Diaz 's re-election things began to happen . One of Madero 's fellow workers , a young lawyer named Roque Estrada , was arrested and taken to prison . Madero furnished bail for Roque Estrada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bail . Immediately after this , on the night of June 7. 1910 , Madero himself was arrested at Monterey . As he was being taken to the penitentiary his wife tried to accompany him , but was beaten back so ruthlessly by the soldiers that she swooned . As soon as she regained consciousness she followed her husband to the penitentiary. where she insisted on spending the night and all of the next day near his cell . She was not allowed to see her husband , however , as Judge Trevino , who had issued the warrant for Madero , had ordered him to be kept incommunicado . The warrant on which Madero was arrested , contrary to the laws of Mexico , contained no formal charge , neither did it bear the signature or the seal of the judge who committed him . A few days later , when the prisoner was formally arraigned , a mass of more or less contradictory charges were preferred against him . First , it was claimed that he had been arrested because he had hurled insults at the police ; next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his escape from justice ; next , that he had incited rebellion and committed criminal libel against President Diaz during a speech made by him at San Luis Potosi . None of these charges was supported by a scintilla of evidence , so at last Madero was recommitted to prison on a charge of having libeled one Juan Orci , a political henchman of Ramon Corral . Madero was kept in prison just long enough to nullify even the last remote chances he might have had in his candidacy for the Presidency . Finally , when the triumphant re-election of President Diaz was once more announced from every part of the Republic , Madero 's friends were allowed to bail him out for the sum of $10,000 . The only reason why Panchito was suffered to live and to emerge from prison , so it was explained by a gentleman of the Diaz inner circle , was because of the presence of so many distinguished foreigners and newspaper correspondents in the capital on the occasion of Mexico 's centennial of independ/ ence in September , 1910 . General Diaz did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any awkward stories of political persecution in Mexico . As soon as Madero was released from prison he betook himself to San Luis Potosi , and there , on October 5 , 1910 , he published his famous cry to arms , formulated on a definite political platform known as the " Plan of San Luis Potosi . " Madero 's " plan " opened with this sentence : " All sovereign peoples , while striving constantly after the ideals of liberty and justice , find themselves compelled at certain moments of crisis to undergo heavy sacrifices . Our dear country has arrived at such a moment . A tyranny the like of which no people should be made to endure weighs down upon us . In exchange for this tyranny we are offered peace . But peace without freedom and without justice is not a blessing but a disgrace . It is better for our Mexican people to fight and to suffer than to continue to enjoy so shameful a boon . " The main principles of Madero 's platform were expressed in the two catchwords , " Effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " plan , " the full text of which contained some three thousand words , Madero pointed out that these desired reforms of honest elections and rotation in office were precisely the promises which Porfirio Diaz made in his famous revolutionary " Plan of Noria , " when he rose against Juarez in 1871 . Other significant reforms insisted upon in Madero 's " plan " were a more equitable distribution of the vast stretches of fertile soil then held in the hands of but a few rich landholders ; free restitution of the land wrested from Indian tribes , such as the Yaquis and Mayas ; liberation of all political prisoners and of all Yaqui prisoners of war condemned to peonage ; abolition of the military practice of making soldiers out of condemned criminals ; and , above all , positive guarantees for the constitutional rights of free speech and a free ptess . Madero 's cry to arms ended with this ringing sentence : " Take up arms , my people , drive the despots from power , recover your rights of free men . Remember our forebears who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stain . Be like them , invincible in war , magnanimous in victory l " When Madero issued this manifesto he fixed the night of November 29 , 1910 , as the date for a general rising . His plan was discovered prematurely , however , and he had to flee the country before that date . His principal fellow-conspirator , Alfredo Dominguez , was arrested in Mexico City , together with several others . Owing to this premature discovery , Madero 's agents in Puebla thought best to make their rising earlier than the date originally set . Thus the revolution broke out on November 20 , with the abortive rising and massacre of Aguiles Serdan and his friends in Puebla . The subsequent history of the revolution centered almost entirely around the personality of Madero . After purchasing large quantities of arms and ammunition in the United States , he went to San Antonio , Texas , and thence to El Paso , where he established revolutionary juntas , backed up by another junta in Washington , D. C. A warrant of arrest for violation of our neutrality laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a handful of his followers , crossed over into Chihuahua and entered actively into the campaign of Chihuahua , which presently extended to the neighboring States of Sonora and Sinaloa . The first battle of any note was fought at Mal Paso , where Pasqual Orozco 's rebels routed a detachment of Federals . The next battle , at Ojinaga , proved a ' reverse for the revolutionists , but they rallied so quickly and became so threatening that new Federal forces under Generals Navarro and Luque had to be sent into Chihuahua . General Navarro , upon his entry into the campaign , suffered a serious reverse at Cerro Prieto . Now General Navarro and his column of Federals were cut off from General Luque , who shut himself up in Ojinaga , where he remained inactive throughout the rest of the campaign . President Diaz was compelled to send out another column of Federals in aid of General Navarro , whose situation had become critical . Meanwhile the revolution gained impetus in the States of Sonora , Sinaloa , Vera Cruz , Tabasco , and Yucatan . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madero shifted his objective from the capital of Chihuahua to Ciudad Juarez , opposite El Paso . Had Madero been more of a strategist he might have captured Ciudad Juarez at this early stage in the revolution , but his forces moved so slowly that a Federal column under Colonel Rabago , who was falling back from  |p620  Casas Grandes , in Chihuahua , was able to fight its way back into Ciudad Juarez . For a while it looked as if the Government would be successful in suffocating the revolution , but Madero 's adherents , though elusive , still gave so much trouble in Chihuahua and Sonora , cutting railways and telegraph lines , helping themselves to horses and driving off cattle , that President Diaz despatched another strong military expedition to the frontier under Colonel Cuellar , one of the most promising officers of the Mexican General Staff . Cuellar and Madero locked horns in an all but decisive battle at Casas Grandes , where both rival leaders were wounded ? Cuellar losing an arm , while Madero was shot through the wrist of his sword arm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the Government organs published stories to the effect that Madero had been killed and that his forces had been utterly dispersed . But the war in Chihuahua somehow went on , and Madero himself reappeared so soon in the field , giving out interviews to American war correspondents at widely scattered points , that the Mexican people all over the Republic came to a realization that this man was too much for Diaz . At the same time Madero 's preliminary work of sending arms and money to his most trusted sympathizers at different points of the Republic began to have telling effect . While the forces under the direct command of Madero were reorganizing in Chihuahua the revolution extended to all the neighboring States , and roving bands of Maderists harassed all the Government 's railways and seaports as far south as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec . By the time that Madero resumed the offensive and marched for Ciudad Juarez at the head of all the various bands raised by Orozco , Vilfa , Blanco , Dosal , Cardenas , aided by strong contingents of American soldiers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's friend Ambrosio Figueroa , in the south , had been able to raise a revolutionary army of more than six thousand men , with which he overran the State of Guerrero and gave trouble even within a few leagues of Mexico City . It was plain to all now that there was no military man in all of Diaz 's army strong enough to stem the rising tide . In despair General Diaz ordered the recall of his former Minister of War and later rival , General Bernardo Reyes , whom he had exiled to Europe . General Reyes obeyed the summons , but it was too late . Fighting of a serious nature was resumed along the northern frontier , and the resulting damage to American interests , especially at El Paso , Douglas , Bisbee , and Nogalez , served to heighten the Mexican people 's dread of foreign intervention on the part of the American " maneuver division " concentrated along the border . Peace negotiations were attempted by the Diaz Government through the medium of Messrs . Braniff , Obregon , and Judge Carbajal , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other relatives of Madero who were furnished with safe conduct through the Federal lines . A brief armistice was concluded , and for a while it looked as if peace might be brought about , especially after Madero 's generous offer to relinquish his Presidential aspirations if General Diaz would promise to resign and would fix a date for his resignation ; but General Diaz was so vague in his concessions that it all came to naught and hostilities were resumed amid mutual recriminations . Rather than risk American intervention at Juarez , Madero now announced that he would withdraw his army from the frontier to march southward upon the capital of Chihuahua . This retrograde movement , undertaken against the better judgment of Madero 's foreign military advisers , Viljoen and Garibaldi , as well as against the protests of such experienced guerrilla fighters as Orozco , Villa , Blanco , and the American soldiers of fortune , was actually begun . At the moment , though , when Madero 's rear guard of Americans received orders to draw off from their trenches close to Ciudad Juarez , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifting of the siege , the Americans got out of hand and a small detachment of them succeeded in rushing the trenches of their Federal enemies and managed to get into the bull ring . Madero , as soon as he heard of this unexpected rear-guard action , tried to stop the fighting , and sent one of his officers with a white flag to propose another truce to General Navarro , the Federal commandant of Juarez , but the bearer of the white flag was shot from his horse , and this so enraged the fighting rebels that they redoubled their efforts and got well into the city . Rather than leave their fighting comrades in the lurch , Pasqual Orozco , Blanco , and Villa , in frank disobedience of Madero 's orders . turned their columns and fought their way  |p621  back into Juarez , to the rescue of their American comrades penned up in the bull ring . The fight had now become so general that Madero had to make the best of it , and , letting all his men enter into the battle , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with such telling effect that the Federal commander lost heart and surrendered . This unlooked-for success , won in spite of Madero , as it were , proved a decisive victory for his cause , and practically ended the was . Though Madero had not shone as a military commander or strategist , a thing he never claimed to be , he shone all the more by his generosity to the vanquished , and by his able administrative acts for the immediate restoration of peace and order in Juarez . Thanks to his firm attitude , there were no deplorable excesses of any kindno drunkenness , no looting , and no bloody reprisals upon helpless men , such as disgraced the revolution in some other parts of Mexico . Madero at Juarez not only brought about an immediate resumption of business by keeping all Government employees , except the actual fighting men , in their regular positions , and by his tactful attitude toward the American authorities across the border , but he also made the city livable again by his wise sanitary measures and by his humane encouragement of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the expenses out of his own private purse . This won him the respect even of his enemies . This esteem was raised to admiration by his high personal courage , shown at the most critical moment of his career , when his most trusted officer , Pasqual Orozco , mutinied and tried to make him a prisoner unless he consented to the massacre of the captive Federal commander and his paroled officers . Through alone and quite helpless in his little tent against the giant Orozco and his armed followers , Madero in this trying moment never yielded an inch , but actually faced down the mutineers by a few quiet words , appealing to their better nature . He followed this up by taking the threatened Federal general single-handed from his scowling guards , after which he conducted him personally to the bank of the Rio Grande , whence General Navarro could cross to the American side and to safety . This one brave act , as well as his magnanimous forgiveness of Orozco 's rash insubordination , won the heart of the Mexican people more for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After this Madero had all the sympathy of the Mexican people , while General Diaz had practically none . The cause of the revolution triumphed by the conquest of public opinion rather than by arms . This alone explains why the loss of a single city on the farthest frontier should have been enough to drive so firmly established a dictator as General Diaz from his throne and from his country . All of Madero 's subsequent conduct , during his triumphant return to the capital and his tour of the country while restoring order and mustering out his troublesome followers , under the interim Presidency of Francisco de la Barra , served to shed further light on his estimable qualities for political leadership , such as honesty , earnestness , fairness , liberality , magnanimity , modesty , and , above all , common horse-sense and kindly tact . Whether these qualities alone , without the glamour of high military achievements and without the fear inspired by the iron rule of the sword , will be enough to hold so fickle and troublesome a people as the Mexicans are remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his full term as President , and if he keeps true to his promise not to try to perpetuate his rule , he will have dons more for his country than did all the wealth of-foreign gold which poured into- Mexico during the long rule of Porfirio Diaz.
