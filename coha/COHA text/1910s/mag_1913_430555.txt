 | Since the United States declared by ordinance on December 4 , 1781 , their acceptance of the law of nations , " According to the general usages of Europe , " we have maintained a diplomatic corps upon eccentric principles peculiarly our own . We have always repudiated the idea that a diplomatist should be a person specially trained or equipt for his business ; we have always refused to give such public servants adequate pay , and we have always failed to provide them with official residences according to the general custom of the world . In a word , our policy has been to entrust the most difficult and the most delicate of all public functions to untrained men , and then to hamper them with every possible drawback . The wonder is that under such circumstances American diplomatists have been able to succeed at all . Only the overshadowing genius of a comparatively few men has saved us from greater humiliations . With our advent as a world-power the entire inadequacy of the old system became more manifest than ever before . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sea , with Western Europe and its problems on the one hand , and the Orient and its problems on the other . We are destined to become more and more the great arbitrating power between the two , and upon that arbitrating power the peace of the world must more and more depend . One of the greatest needs of the United States today is a well-trained diplomatic corps capable of dealing with the mighty problems which our position as a world-power has suddenly cast upon us . We not only have no such corps , but we are doing all in our power to make its existence impossible . After Congress failed to do anything to meet the new conditions , an attempt was made to fill the great vacuum by giving over the great posts to very rich men who in some instances seriously offended the sensibilities of the nation by lavish display . As a consequence of that unfortunate experiment it has recently been found very difficult to induce competent and distinguished men who are poor to follow those who have maintained an ostentatious method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope of making a move in the right direction I introduced not long ago in the House of Representatives , " A bill providing for the leasing and purchasing of suitable official residences for ambassadors and ministers in the countries herein named , and for furnishing and equipping the same . " A short time thereafter that bill was introduced in the Senate without change by Mr. Bacon , of Georgia . This bill did not originate with me ; it was drafted by my friend , Mr. Hannis Taylor , whose long connection with diplomacy and international law specially fitted him for the task . It is the outcome of his experiences and observations while Minister Plenipotentiary at Madrid , where , as a poor man , he was called upon to endure all the hardships and mortifications incident to the existing system . Mr. Taylor 's plan for relief , embodied in the pending bill , was cordially approved by President Cleveland and Mr. Olney , but at that time Congress failed to enact it into law . The pending measure , which should be  | past before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomatic salaries remain as they are ; second , that every diplomat be provided at once with an official residence , leased and furnished at the public expense ; third , that four or five residences be purchased each year , whenever a good bargain can be had . Such is the prevailing custom everywhere . All governments , as a rule , rent unfurnished houses for their embassies and legations and then equip them ; it is an exception when they purchase them . Out of the thirty-six or thirty-seven embassies and legations in Washington only six are owned by the governments occupying them . As we have reasonably good houses in Turkey , Japan and China , it will only be necessary to lease thirty four in order to supply official residences for our ambassadors and ministers throughout the world . At what a small cost this can be done will appear from the following table : Thus it appears that for the very modest sum of $180,000 per annum adequate unfurnished houses may be leased in every capital in the world in which provision has not already been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfurnished houses for one year , with a privilege of renewal for several years more , and then to buy in exceptional cases when a good bargain is to be had .  | Thus it appears that for the very modest sum of $357,000 all of our embassies and legations may be adequately furnished in the thirty-four capitals in which provision should be made . If the foregoing plan could be put into operation at once the entire situation would be unusually relieved . A fisherman is scarcely more dependent in his business upon a boat of his own than a diplomatist upon an official residence provided and equipt by his own government at its own expense . It is the official character of the house rather than its dimensions that give it dignity . In the eyes of the European nothing is more vulgar than a showy palace provided by a diplomatist at his own expense as his private enterprise , because in that way his government is made to appear as a pensioner , a mendicant , dependent upon his bounty . And in that way painful contrast is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomat and his less fortunate successor . Under the plan proposed all such differences would at once disappear . The rich and the poor would be required to live in the same houses , and in substantially the same way . Simplicity , elegance and uniformity would become the rule . A poor man would be able to live in quiet dignity upon what the government provides .
