txt The great news of this convention is not whether Roosevelt or Taft shall be nomlnoted ; rot whether Roosevelt will bolt if he Is defeated ; not the Identity of a possible third , or compromise , candidate ; not the character of the platform . These are interesting and important details of a notable gathering but they are not the vital details . The great news of this con , vention is this : This convention , now in progress in Chicago , marks the passing ' of Republican national conventions of a , similar character . There never will he another convention like this . It is quite possible there never will be another Republican national convention of any kind ; that this is the last , but , whether or not , there never will be another like this one or resembling in any regard the conventions of previous years running away hack to 1860 . Moreover  --  and this Is even more important ? this convention gives a date to the death of the Republican party as it la at present constituted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name Republican may live , but the Republican party that name has ped since 1816 is dead . The funeral services are being conducted in Chicago at the present time . New Political System Here . Take these two propositions in order , beginning with the passing of the present style of convention . There never will be another Republican national convention like this one , or like the one of four or of eight years ago , or those of sixteen or twenty years ago , for the reason that the political system that made conventions easily possible in the past and barely possible now has changed . The old politics is gone . The old politicians have been shifted out of power . A new generation Is almost in command , a new idea prevails , a new system is in process of development . The Republican party is no longer a cohesive , fighting , definite organization . Instead It is really two parties , a stand at or conservative party and a radical or progressive party . There Is n't the slightest doubt if there had Veen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them the old crowd would have a pitifully small representation here , no matter whether Mr. Roosevelt was a candidate or not . So far as that eminent candidate is concerned , he grabbed progressivism , prOgree , siviam did n't grab him . Nor does that mean , necessarily , that the Republican party is overwhelmingly Progressive . It means that the Republican party has outgrown its old systems and its old leaders and that the people demand a new method of selecting their candidates . They demand the right to have a hand in the selection Instead of being told of those selections after they are made . Even Conservatives Want Change . If a census could be made it would be found that the radical element In the Republican party is not so much greater than the con , servative element as bas been claimed . There are many conservative Republicans , but even the conservatives are fully alive to the deficiencies of the present System , and many of . them are as anxious for a readjustment as are the progressives . The fact of It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have advanced beyond the Methods of twenty years ago , and that neither wing is wholly In sympathy with the present methods . It is quite probable that before it comes time to nominate another candidate for the presidency enough more states will have adopted the preferential primary system to make whatever convention shall be held merely a ratification meeting , about the same sort of a gathering as a meeting of the electoral college ; but even if that does not come : or eight years , say , there never will be another Republican national convention where the Republican national committee can make up a temporary roll , and where a preen . ranged credentials committee can have the 4nst word on the confirmation of that roll . There never will be another Republican national convention where delegates from the south , where there are no Republicans In number , and where no Republican electoral votes can be obtained , can hold the balance of power as those delegates do in this conven. tlon . There never will be another Republican national convention where there can be the preconvention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this convention , nor where It will be possible to do what has been done by the national committee at this conventicn . People to Do the Selecting . I say this without criticism of the present committee . ManY of the contests brought before that body were bogus , and trumped up for political effeot . What I mean is that the people will no longer tolerate a system that will give to the national committee the power to name a presidential candidate by selecting delegates to a convention . They will no longer allow one man froM each State to act as a judge and a dictator . They // CONVENTION ENDS RULE OF BOSSES // rstla dot their selecting themselves , or most of them will . The national committee , as a determining factor for candidates , has been shoved out of power . No national committee ever will perform as many national committees have performed in the , past , even without enough primary states . It svfli be deader than a emelt in four years from now . The old cry of " Stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetich . The people will stand by no organization that will not stand by them . And by this I do not mean that the protest is pro-Roosevelt , for it Is greater than that . Mr. Roosevelt adroitly seized a. moment for his own aggrandizement . thad id much greater than he is , great though he may be . He capitalized a cause that existed before he thought of seizing it and that will continue to grow even after he has , retired from view . Mr. Roosevelt projected himself into a , leadership . He did not incite the rebellion , nor did he ever do much toward supporting It until lately , Not a Roosevelt Condition . The condition is not a Roosevelt condition He le merely the incident symptom of the condition . It is a widespread , deep down movement that has worked with much rapidity , in the last four years and will work with even greater rapidity in the coming four years . This Convention , with its contests , itsstrugt gle for delegates , Its parliamentary seesawing , Its lack of determination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new , Its creaking , rusty machinery , its petty politics and its petty ' politicians , its reliance on patronage and . federal officeholders , its coercion and corruption , its methods of twenty years ago , when the people were complaisant instead of contentious , Its bosses , and its bossed  --  this convention is the last of its kind . There never will be another like it . It is quite likely , there never will beanother Of any kind , except as a ratification meeting , but , certainly there never will be another Where a national committee will , have so great power . Those days are gone , Old RepublicanteM Chine . Moreover , to get to the second . proposition , the Republican party , as such , no longer ex-Isle . It is dead . The old Republican party of high protection , of war memories , of nateble achievement has passed . No further proof of that is needed than the convention now in session in Chicago . The opening day . and the second day , as well as the preliminaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention of so recent a data as four or eight years age , ' sabers not onetenth'Of the delegates knew , even by sight , the men who have directed the affairs of the Party for two decades ! Imagine a Republican national convention of even four years . or eight years ago , where James Ill . Watson of 1 Indiana , was floor leader , and the great leaders were Bodes Penrose and Murray Crane and William 13arnes on the one hand , and Herbert S. Hadley . and William Flinn and Francis J. Hems ' on the other ! Imagine a Republican convention where Serene E. Payne and William 0 . Bradlee* were the best who can be put forward to defend a proposition on which the whole Mcraeture of the organization depends ! Imagine a Republican convention where the organization candidate , who is president of the ' United States , has a few adherents and no friends , and whose supporters are supporting him for purely personal , selfish , and political reasons and not for patriotic or party ream= event Old Leaders Now Spectators . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from all parts of the United States , men who have been active leaders In years gone by , are on hand merely as spectators . and where scores of other men active as leaders for years areenot present at all . The new order has passed them by . They are not considered . No matter what kind of &; platform is adopted , no matter who is nominated , no matter whether Mr. Taft is named , no matter whether Dlr . Roosevelt is chosen or bolts , no matter If a third candidate is selected to " save the party "  --  the party that follows Taft , that follows Roosevelt . or that Is " saved " by a compromise will be a new party , or it will be two parties , one a relic and the other a foundation . All this is clearly apparent to any person who has watched the two sessions of tile convention thus far held , who was , ched the preliminaries , both in the states and before the national committee . This uprising that has wrecked the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun before Mr , Roosevelt took advantage of it . It will grow with or without his expert assistance . There Is more to it than there Is to Rooseveltism , who merely types it now , and there is more to it than there is to anti-Thttisni . It is a basic , a fundamental condition . Old Party Ties Outgrown . The country has outgrown the old system . It has outgrown the old party ties . It is Intolerant of organization demands . It has cast the old style politician aside . The people ar , e working with whatever instruments they have at hand6 and some of those instruments are crude , but they will dine the men when they get the condition established , The old time politician Is out of it . This ' convention shows that , for even if the old time politicians succeed to nominating Mr. Taft they have done nothing but nominate him . The people have the say as to his election . And the same will hold true of Mr. Roosevelt . ' There will be politicians , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old style ones . Here is a convention , now being held ) to Chicago , that Is ' epicene , not one thing or the other . It marks the last stand of the old crowd ' and sets out the skirmisil line of the new . Unfailingly it predicts the new alignment that must come . Certainly it points out the fact that must be recognized , the acit that the politics of this country must be readjusted , that there must be a radical party and a conservative party . Inevitably , also , the convention at Baltimore will prove the same contention There are now four parties  --  a conservative Republican and a radical Republican , and a conservative Democratic and a radical Democratic . Four parties can not exist , for no one of the four can hold the majority , and ours is a government by majorities . Every Move Suggests Change . Every word of debate , every bit of strategy , every piece of manipulation , every struggle for votes , every deal with delegates , every speech , every motion , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday . Droved this contention . Nominally , all were either Taft or Roosevelt demonstrations , Really they showed the struggle between the conservatives and the radicals in the Republican party . Absolutely they pointed to the disintegration of the Repub. limn party as it has existed in the past . It makes no difference whether they suocoed In nominating Mr. Taft in this convention or whether Mr. Roosevelt is named by this convention or by a bolting convention he organizes . If Mr. Taft Is named ' the Roosevelt partisans will make their protest on election day , and if Roosevelt Is nominated the Taft men will do the same thing , and it both are named the issue will be clean cut within the Republican party . It will be the same if a compromise candidate is selected , for in the case of a compromise , and after the event of the Baltimore Democratic nomination , there is no doubt that the people will divide , to a large extent , on radical and conservative lines and that the more radical of the two men named by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the radicals in both parties and the conservative will be supported similarly by the conservatives . If Roosevelt head not gone into the tight at ell , and the Republicans were now naming Mr. Taft , as it seemed a few months ago they would do without much opposition , the result would be the same , for the radicals in the Republican party , in that event , would surely support the Demooratie candidate In large numbers , if he ' were radical . Failing such a candidate , there probably would be a third party . No compromise candidate can make a . POhesive party of the Republican party . It is split wide apart . This convention has proved that time and again , and is proving it every minute it Is In
