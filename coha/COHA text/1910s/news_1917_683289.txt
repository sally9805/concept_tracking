txt The Wrong Kind of Criticism . We are a more or less free people , and the privilege of grumbling is doubtless ours , but ? does criticism of a wholly destructive character benefit any one ? Does uninformed faultfinding with the acts , thoughts , and alleged motives of those intrusted with the nation 's work at such a time as this improve the national mot ale ? Does muckraking alone improve service ? Does a man , or an army , or even a Coagress do better work or accomplish more in a given time for ridicule , abuse , and sneers ? As I understand the situation , every one except German sympathizers wants us to do our utmost to wla the war . German sympathizers are either peaceable aliens who keep their mouths shut and their pens locked up or enemies and traitors who , under the law , must themselves be locked up  --  or worse . Giving aid and ? comfort to ? the enemy is a treasonable act . , Statements printed in our newspapers to the effect that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inadequate and ill-equipped , that our army program can not possibly be carried out on time , that our public men are unfit or unpatriotic , that our food supply is short , that our working people are starving , that any quantity of similar lies is true , certainly give comfort , if not aid , ' to such of the enemy as are fools enough to believe them , and , what is much worse and more to the point , tend to the discouragement of such of our own well-meaning citizens as allow their thinking to , be done for them , and may even lead to the serious disturbing of public confidence . By all means let us have the truth , given by those who know the truth . Let us also have all the criticism of a constructive nation that the traffic will bear . Some of it may do good . but the other kind benefits none and disgusts many . A Fourth of July Thought . In today 's issue of The Atlanta Journal appears this ringing sentence : " There is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kings and the Declaration of Independence . " Old America is beginning to realize this . This declaration epitomizes American thought , and is going to bring from America a blow sufficient to put out the worst notion that ever entered the thought of man  --  the Divine Right of Kings .
