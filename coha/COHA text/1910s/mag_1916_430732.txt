 | THE average independent voter , early in November , will go through a fairly simple process . Unless there is some dramatic happening to sidetrack his attention , some sudden accident with Mexico or Germany , his mind is likely to function like this : " The man in the White House has done pretty well . We are prosperous . They argue about why we are prosperous , but we are . We are at peace . They say we ought to have obtained the diplomatic victory over Germany with fewer notes , but I guess it is n't so easy to defend our rights and keep out of war . It is easy to scold about it afterward , but it was a hard situation and Wilson did a pretty good job . Same with Mexico . Some say if he had kissed Huerta on the mouth it would have been easy . It was a bad mess and we have got by , so far . I do n't see much sense in fighting Mexico to help out a bunch that want to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and a half . We know what he can do , and he has learned the business . This fellow Hughes may be all right , but why risk a change unless a powerful reason is put up ? " It is always necessary to bear in mind the difference between the simple voter and the highbrow . The simple voter will elect Wilson , if the situation remains as it is , on the argument of Prosperity and Peace . The President will get a large element of the thinking Independents , on the other hand , including many Progressives , for less simple reasons ? on the ground that he is the liberal leader . Our people are more conservative than any other great nation ? except China ? on the earth . We have little political courage , background , or point of view . We are accustomed to  | viewing with alarm steps ahead that in Europe have become commonplaces . The leader of our liberal movement to-day , President Wilson , would be looked upon as decidedly moderate in any of the great civilizations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the large corporations are against the President , because in their opinion the world ought not to move merely slowly ; it ought not to move at all ; or else it should move backward . They have resented a number of his specific measures , but still more they have resented the determined freedom of his spirit . I know men of the rich Tory type , and am sure that what they hate most is the President 's remoteness from their influence . In the past it has been deemed an honor when a captain of industry , however predatory , asked for the opportunity of putting his ideas before a President . Mr. Wilson , at the beginning of his term , placed these men on the plane of the humblest citizen . He was busy . He had the nation 's work to do . He would see nobody whose presence would distract this accomplishment . On March 5th , 1913 , at 9 o'clock in the morning , he told a friend that , whatever happened , he should protect himself from confusion and distraction and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . A little later he was asked by a friend whether he was willing to see a captain of industry who had some suggestions to make about the proposed Currency Act . " Only , " said the President , " if he seeks the same objects I do . " Being interpreted , that speech meant that he would take advice given in good faith , on how to diffuse and equalize credit facilities ? how to lessen the power of the money trust , ? but he would not waste his strength and darken his mind by taking up the question of whether such an object should be sought at all . He had decided that question before he made his speeches on the new freedom in the summer and autumn of 1912 , and he meant to devote himself not to reconsidering and vacillating , but to accomplishing and fulfilling . It is by his relentless pursuit of his object , in silent confi-  | dence , that Wall Street has been most offended . Why , readers of the YALE REVIEW , do the Republicans find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this year 's campaign ? Certainly it is not because they love Mr. Hughes . They accepted him only because he seemed the most likely weapon to defeat the President and also to elect a Republican Senate . With a Senate led by Smoot , Gallinger , Penrose , and the grand Old Guard in general , they knew that at least no more steps ahead could be taken . Possibly the Currency Act could be amended in favor of Wall Street ; possibly the tariff could be amended in favor of the trusts ; possibly the recognition that labor has human rights and requires human standards could be reversed by repealing the Clayton Act and the Seamen 's Act ; perhaps the rural credits system could be made less satisfactory to the farmer and more satisfactory to the money trust ; probably China , South America , Mexico , might be treated exclusively from the investor 's point of view . All these revisions might or might not be accomplished ; what is certain in their minds is that , with such a Senate , no steps can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be an actuality . If Hughes is elected , the invisible government may or may not be able to bring positive things about . It will at any rate be able to prevent any step of which it disapproves . If you wonder why the vast reactionary elements of this country are so strong for Mr. Hughes , keep that simple explanation in your mind . If the Senate is Republican , the men in control of the most powerful committees will be the Old Guard . Neither Mr. Hughes nor anyone else can prevent that result . It is automatic . In the light of this situation , can you not understand what Mr. Root meant in his ardent pleas to business men to bring about a return of the days when they controlled legislation at Washington ? to the days of Hanna and McKinley ? Can you not hear the righteous tremor in his voice as he exclaimed :  | When we elected McKinley in 1896 , and again in 1900 , it was the business men of the United States who controlled the election . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of men who carry on the great production and commerce and transportation , and who finance the business of this mighty and prosperous country , which elected McKinley and inaugurated and maintained the policies of his administration . . . . We have the Interstate Commerce Commission keeping tab on the railroads . We have the Central Reserve Board of the Treasury Department , and the office of the Comptroller of Currency following every move of the banks . We have the new Trade Commission , which is empowered to go into your factories and mills and inquire into your personal affairs for the purpose of seeing whether you conform to that vague and indefinite standard which they are to apply to trade . We have the Internal Revenue Collector empowered to go into your personal affairs for the purpose of seeing whether your returns for the graduated income tax are full and complete . We have the Pure Food Law , under which a vast range of production is subject to inspection and regulation , into the most minute detail . Everywhere , in every direction , supervision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal to amend the Constitution by putting in a prohibition amendment is the first step towards national control of sumptuary laws directing what shall and shall not be done in every community ; amendments to the Constitution in respect to the franchise , to direct who in every State , shall or shall not have the right to the elective franchise ; and in general the great industrial community of the North and East is more and more being subjected to government control and regulation , by the people of the parts of the country that know little of the business of the country . I say the sceptre has passed . . . . There is a tendency for the railroads to be afraid of the Interstate Commerce Commission , and for the banks to be afraid of the Central Reserve Board and the Comptroller of Currency , and for the express companies to be afraid of the Postmaster General , and for the industrial establishments to be afraid of the new Trade Commission , and for the manufacturers of everything that comes under the Pure Food Law to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical question for the people of the United States , whether that fear is going to control . For if it does , the power will be abused . There is only one way to meet that kind of power and that is with courage . . . . We will not be governed by men who look upon us as unfit to participate in government .  | Mr. Root is an extremely able man and you have there the frankest and ablest statement of the Tory position that is likely to be made . Mr. Hughes , in his speech of acceptance , stated the same position , but stated it with somewhat more caution and discretion . Mr. Root , in adroit and well chosen language , puts the issue squarely . He speaks with sincerity ; with deepest conviction . He most thoroughly believes that for the government to be put in the hands of the general public , and those who represent the disinterested general public , is wrong . He believes that the rich men should decide for themselves what their special privileges shall be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly can not share it . Let the people of the United States really understand the issue and I for one am glad to trust their decision ; I am glad to hear them say whether they prefer to be governed by Woodrow Wilson , and a Congress dominated by him , listening to the voice of the whole country and looking at the welfare of every class , or whether they prefer to be governed by Mr. Hughes , the most admirable gentleman who believes in what Mr. Root has said , and by a Senate and possibly a House that will be only too glad to escape from the austere necessity of justice , and to slide back to the fat and comfortable system of taking their orders from financial kings . Now , what of the Progressives ? What do the four million men and women who voted for Mr. Roosevelt in 1912 think of the attempt to deliver them back to the System in 1916 ? Of the Colonel 's recommendation that they nominate Lodge for President ? Lodge , the incarnated respectability of the old system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance until the delivery could be completed ? The foremost grievance of 1912 was that the Republican Convention did not represent the will of the voters . What did the Bull Moose National Committee represent in 1916 , when it endeavored to deliver hundreds of thousands of the most  | serious voters in the country ? I should like to have any Progressive tell me the difference between that manoeuvre and the so-called stolen nomination of 1912 , except that the move of 1916 was so much more raw . Listen to parts of Mr. Matthew Hale 's report to the delegates to the Bull Moose Convention : Immediately after the convention your National Committee met , discussed the situation and adjourned until June 26th in order that its members might have an opportunity to get in touch with the rank and file of the Progressives throughout the country . . . . During the debate and the roll-call , it was called to the attention of the National Committee that the delegates to the National Convention , or the State Progressive organizations in various States whose votes were finally recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ votes were not allowed to be recorded at all , had gone on record against the endorsement of a Republican candidate : Alabama . Voted for the endorsement of the Republican candidate . The State Executive Committee of Alabama submitted to the National Committee the following resolution : " Resolved : That it is the sense of the State Committee of the Progressive Party in Alabama that if Col. Roosevelt does not accept the Progressive nomination , the National Committee should nominate a candidate of our own party , both for President and Vice-President , and in no event should the National Committee endorse the candidate of any other political faith . " Michigan . Voted for the endorsement of the Republican candidate . The National Committeeman from Michigan called a meeting of Michigan Progressives to ascertain if possible the opinion of the party in Michigan . The men who replied to his summons by coming , passed the following resolution , which was submitted to the National Committee : " We , the members of the National Progressive Party of Michigan , in conference assembled in Jackson , Michigan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are in favor of representing the party . We have a contract with the people which in good faith , we must fulfill . This can only be accomplished by substituting a leader of our own , inasmuch as the name of Charles E. Hughes was received without the least expression of favor when mentioned several times in the Progressive Convention .  | New Jersey . Voted for the endorsement of the Republican candidate . The National Committeeman from New Jersey when voting in favor of the third party ticket ( stating that such action was against his own judgment ) said : " I am instructed by my State to vote for a third ticket . " Virginia . Voted for the endorsement of the Republican candidate . The Virginia delegation to the National Convention met in the Auditorium Hotel on June 10th . The following resolution was passed unani-mously : " First . That our National Committeeman be and is hereby instructed that in case Colonel Roosevelt finally refuses to make the race as the candidate of the Progressive Party for President , we shall insist upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Mr. Hale then gives the evidence that Progressive sentiment was against endorsement in Minnesota , Louisiana , and Indiana , and that New York and Maryland were in doubt . He then adds : The Progressive platform of 1912 provided that the selection of party candidates should be made after consultation with the rank and file of the party and in accordance with their wishes . . . . An attempt by a small group of men to deliver the Progressive Party organization to the Republican candidate in a manner which violates one of the most fundamental principles of the Progressive Party is an affront to the sincerity of all Progressives . This arrogant attempt of George Perkins , Theodore Roosevelt , and William Flynn , through their aids and proxies , to deliver to the Republican Party an army that had been brought together to stand at Armageddon and to battle for the Lord , will appear in an even starker light if we consider what has been done under Mr. Wilson to bring about exactly what was urged in the Progressive platform of 1912 . I speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in the Currency and Tariff Acts , and in the closing of the White House door to back-stairs influence , but of those social ameliorative measures which to the Bull Moose mind meant so much . Consider some examples :  | 2 . The Progressive platform in 1912 demanded as one of its planks the development of the creative power of labor through industrial education in schools . The Smith-Lever Net is perhaps the greatest educational measure ever passed by Congress . It was followed by the Smith-Hughes Bill , providing for the extension of Federal aid for agricultural education in rural schools , industrial education in city schools , Ind the training of teachers for both . 3 . An industrial commission was appointed to get at the sources of industrial unrest . 4 . The McGillicuddie Bill , which passed the House in July , provides for the prevention of industrial accidents to Federal employees . 5 . Involuntary unemployment is a problem towards solving which a start has been made by Federal employment urgencies under the direction of the Bureau of Labor , with . he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also in co-operation with Public Employment Agencies in States and cities . 6 . Congress has emphasized minimum wage standards ' or working women ; prohibition of night work for women ; in eight-hour day for women and young persons ; one day of est in seven for all wage-earners . It has extended the eightlour principle beyond work done by the government to work lone for the government by private firms . 7 . The Administration forced the passage of the KeatingOwen Child Labor Bill . The Children 's Bureau has done excellent work . 8 . The plank on prison reform in the Democratic platform of 1916 is equivalent to that of the Progressive platform n 1912. 9 . The phosphorus match law , protecting the health of he laborers , fulfilled another Progressive demand . These are a few items of the long and creditable list , provng that the present Administration has largely carried out he demands of the Progressive Party , and practically in all .  | cases where it has not yet carried them out it has shown in its platform of 1916 an intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . It happened also that , for other reasons , the Bull Moose were especially interested in the creation of a Federal Trade Commission . The Democrats have given it to them , in the safest , most exact form . The purpose of the Trade Commission Act , as finally passed , was to create a body of experts , clothed with suitable powers , in order to bring about a more intelligent and effective administration of the policy which forbids monopoly and aims at the maintenance of reasonably competitive conditions in industry . As these words are written , Mr. Hughes has said nothing about trusts , their regulation , or the Trade Commission . The powers of the Commission are threefold : regulatory , investigatory , and auxiliary to the courts and to the Attorney-General . Its only regulatory power is to prevent the use of unfair methods of competition in interstate and foreign commerce . Most of the trusts have been built up and have maintained their monopolistic power by the use of unfair methods to crush competitors who , had they had a fair chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed that a commission in constant touch with business , familiar with business practices and their effect , would be able to exercise the power of prevention so as to keep the field of business open to all who have the ability and means to succeed , and to check any tendency to monopoly through abuse of power , before it has become dangerous to the community . Mr. Root is naturally angry , and so are the Old Guard generally ; but Progressives should rejoice . The investigatory power will be mainly useful in gathering detailed and accurate information about various industries which , in time , should be very helpful to the government and also to business men in dealing with industrial problems . The detection of violations of law probably will be less frequently the object of investigation than the diagnosis of  | It has been asserted that Mr. Wilson has not been strong in appointments and that his closest advisers have been weak men . Consider just a few cases . The closest adviser of the President is generally taken to be Colonel House , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and disinterested man . The Cabinet contains the best equipped Secretary of Agriculture we have ever had , and the most resourceful and creative Secretary of the Treasury in our day , if not since Hamilton . An article as long as this could be filled with the briefest outline of what Mr. Houston has done for the farmer and the consumer ; and Mr. McAdoo 's services , in preventing a panic when the war broke out , in his part in organizing the Federal Reserve system , in freeing the treasury from improper influences , in his first step towards South American trade , and in his administrative vigor and efficiency , will be placed high in history . The value of Mr. Lansing in this perilous time is generally understood . The Attorney-General is one of the few lawyers who combine legal standing with a progressive spirit . Secretary Wilson 's organization and conduct of his new department are praised most by those who know most about it . Mr. Lane is one member of the Cabinet who is generally admired even by Republicans . Mr. Baker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary ability , and is recognized by the observant as one of the nation 's coming men . Mr. Daniels , in my opinion , has conducted his department well ; he is the storm centre of attack because many of the army and navy men do not like him , and because his needless ethical observations have helped to blind the public to the excellence of his administration . Mr. Redfield was generally acceptable until lack of judgment in the Eastland matter and the Durant controversy exposed him to fire , and he is certainly putting energy and business experience into his work . Mr. Burleson belongs to a school of politics unlike the rest of the Cabinet , but that is what the opposition clamors for more of . Abroad have been many such men as  | conceivably even before this article sees the light , a desperate Germany may return to submarine barbarism . If she does , a few weeks will see the United States unwillingly at war . If she does not , the Sussex note stands as the Magna Charta of the sea . Think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the vindictiveness shown by Colonel Roosevelt and Mr. Root about Belgium . The one was in the Senate when Belgium was invaded , and said nothing . The other wrote in " The Outlook , " the month after the invasion , the most emphatic support of the President 's position , with barrels of soap for the German-Americans . What despicable hypocrisy , what national shame that these men , for political capital , could attack the President a few months later for a course they had so profoundly justified . It makes an American blush for his politics , when greedy partisan dishonesty refuses to stop at the water 's edge , but would upset even the conduct of foreign negotiations in the hope of getting back into office . Mexico is different . I think Mr. Roosevelt would thoroughly enjoy conquering that little country , telling it how to be good , handing it copy-book effusions , splurging about in uniform , and exhibiting red blood all over the stage . If Judge Gary and Mr. Perkins and Mr. Hearst and Mr. Otis , and other exponents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , told him he was a strong , brave man on horseback , hauling humanity towards the Lord , so much the better ; he would believe it . About Mr. Hughes I ani not so sure . I wish I knew whether in his heart of hearts he agrees with what Henry Lane Wilson , Senator Fall , and Nelson O'Shaughnessy have been telling him about the whole duty of the American people towards the Hearst and Otis ranches and the ordinary Mexican population . If I were to put one of Mr. Wilson 's doings first , I am not sure it would not be precisely his treatment of Mexico , partly because the predicament was the most baffling and required the most courage . The same spirit that at Princeton lowered the lance against social and  | financial caste , that carried on the war in Trenton and at Washington , guided the undertaking to help the Mexicans in their struggle towards freedom , vast as their difficulties were . A coward would have recognized Huerta , the murderous head of an oligarchy owned by foreign money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when so many hazards blocked the path . Many a swashbuckler , physically vivacious , is a coward in the face of moral difficulty and complex , threatening circumstance . Mr. Hughes 's halo , a favorite one with me , suffered when he decided to leave the court to carry the banner of the Tory opposition , but the most grievous blow came in that first brief message , when the only things I could understand were that he desired a so-called strong hand in Mexico , along with a Mark Hanna rule for us . In all the speeches he has made since , I have understood little more . Do n't ask everything of any one man . How would Governor Hughes fare if his state administration were treated as narrowly as he is treating President Wilson ? Those who wish to answer this question should buy " What 's the Matter with New York . " Its subtitle is " A Story of the Waste of Millions . " John A. Hennessy , the author of it , stood on the firing line in the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to point out any inaccuracy in his militant speeches . He knows the state government . Hennessy says of Hughes that he " knew less of the State and accomplished less than any man since the days of Cornell . " Hennessy means on the business side . Hughes did a few valuable things . He made the young men believe in his honesty and determination . He tried hard for direct primaries , even if he failed to get them . He interfered with race-track gambling ? an excellent thing to do . He vetoed the full-crew bill , which took a moderate amount of courage ; also the two-cent fare bill , on good principles ; also an income-tax bill , on what he deemed sound principles ; and he established a public utilities commission , which has done  | something . Personally I put those accomplishments , and the spirit behind them , very high . But what a joke for Mr. Hughes to assault Mr. Wilson for every petty , almost laughably small imperfection he can find with a microscope . Here is Hennessy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In all this turmoil the land sharks got in their work well . Two impossible prison sites and one fake rifle range were among the choice bits put over . The asphalt men fastened themselves upon the new Highway Department and began their famous clean-up . It was in these days of high intellectuals that the famous state printing law was enacted , and sandstone granite owned by Republicans of high renown struck the fancy of state architects . Gravel beds not in possession of Democrats developed a usefulness in public works sufficient to enrich all concerned . Thus , while the Governor was pursuing his altruistic studies in statesmanship , the business instincts of his party 's most active agents were working overtime in the great shadow of the virtuous garb worn by the Chief Executive . Not even the spectacle of convicts sleeping in cots in the chapels of the state prisons could get Mr. Hughes down to a view of the State 's real business . " Mr. Hughes , lacking an issue , has been cavilling like a pedant at a few details raked together from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a wreck that the practically unknown and colorless Dix led the Democrats to victory . " Mr. Wilson accomplished far more as Governor of New Jersey than Hughes did as Governor of New York , and led his party instead of wrecking it . As President he led it to the most splendid legislative record of our time ; and if he is left in office four more years , that big liberal programme will be fully rounded out . A stiff theorist Mr. Hughes is proving , as well as a " 100% candidate . " A stiff theorist he proved as Governor , as well as a man wholly ignorant of most business aspects of his administration . Is  | he the man for whom the voters in a crisis should throw Woodrow Wilson out of office ? Is his the party ? Mr. Hughes has commented on the number of Southerners at the head of committees in the House and Senate , never referring to the fact that they get there by seniority rule . How will that rule work if the Republicans should sweep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee on Appropriations ; Nelson of Minnesota , chairman of the Committee on Banking and Currency ; Henry A. du Pont , chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs ; Penrose , chairman of the Committee on Finance ; Lodge , chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations ; Clark of Wyoming , chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary ; William Alden Smith , chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs ; McCumber , chairman of the Committee on Pensions ; Townsend , chairman of the Committee on Post Offices and Post Roads ; Sutherland of Utah , chairman of the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds ; Smoot , chairman of the Committee on Public Lands ; Gallinger , president pro tern and chairman of the Committee on Rules . With the retirement of Clapp , Borah and Cummins will be the only progressives to become chairmen of important committees , Borah of the Committee on Education and Labor and Cummins of the Committee on Interstate Commerce . LaFollette will have the Committee on the Census , or Civil Service and Retirement , or Indian Affairs . The tariff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Penrose , Lodge , McCumber , Smoot , Gallinger , Clark of Wyoming , LaFollette , and such other names as may be added to the Committee . Fordney of the Chicago Interocean Sugar Trust negotiations , is the ranking member on the Ways and Means Committee of the House . The tariff bill , no matter what a tariff commission might report , will be the Penrose-Fordney bill , and the old fight against privilege in tariff-making will have to be undertaken again .  | The people want more than carping . They want issues . So far it is hard to find any issues save intervention and Mark Hannaism . Many questions are being asked of Mr. Hughes and his answers up to date do not get very far . Here are some of the questions : 1 . Would Mr. Hughes intervene in Mexico ? 2 . If so , would he recognize the titles granted to the great concessionaries under Diaz , or the new titles to smaller holders in the same land granted by Carranza ? An answer to this last question particularly would help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not now . 3 . Would he have broken off relations with Germany at once when the Lusitania went down ? 4 . Would he have fought on account of the invasion of Belgium ? 5 . Would he have put an embargo on arms ? 6 . Does he favor ship subsidies ? 7 . Does he wish to change the Federal Reserve Act and go back to our former financial system ? Does he prefer the Aldrich plan ? 8 . Is the Rural Credit Act a good measure , and if not , exactly what would he prefer ? 9 . Would he like to go back to the Payne-Aldrich Tariff ? What schedules in the Underwood Tariff would he raise ? 10 . Would he urge the repeal of the Seamen 's Act , and , if so , what steps would he take to give to American seamen decent standards of living ? 11 . Would he urge the repeal of the labor clauses of the Clayton Act ? 12 . Does he think the appointment of Louis D. Brandeis to the Supreme Court to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question he can not , for obvious reasons , answer directly , but he can find some way of explicitly stating his position so that we can understand whether the President 's daring stand for progress is altogether abhorrent to him . Maybe all these matters will be delightfully clear before  | this article appears in print ; but I wonder ! Certainly the answers are very , very slow in coming . Why so slow ? Such precise affirmations would help us to know affirmatively what is in the man 's mind . It would help hundreds of thousands to decide whether they ought to throw out a President with so constructive a record as Mr. Wilson 's , who has guided us in peace and honor through such terrific perils , in order to put in his place a man who , thus far , has merely , with lawyer-like ability , presented all the objections that the opposition could rake together , without being willing to tell , so that anybody could understand it , exactly what he would have done , either in domestic reform or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the President 's most skilful opponent , looking backwards with the easy wisdom of afterthought , can not give any convincing picture of the policy he would have followed , is not that the most splendid tribute to the success and satisfactoriness of a policy which had to be decided upon and executed , not when all the facts were known , but when the universe seemed to be crashing around us ? Would it not be a terrible thing in such a crisis to drop so tried a pilot , the man who has seen us safely through , with peace , prosperity , and honor ; who has given us safe progress with understanding and ability ? What dangerous lunacy to allow partisan considerations to prevail at such a moment ! What folly to endanger our welfare and security by dropping the man of trained knowledge , by shifting to the perilous and the unknown ! Americans will not do it .
