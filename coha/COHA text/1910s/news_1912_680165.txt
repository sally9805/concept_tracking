The Mayor spoke of the benefits which doctors have brought to mankind , but he also dwelt occasionally on his own troubles , which earned to be very much on his mind . The doctors , many of whom do not speak English , gave him hearty applause at the end of his address . " I am particularly anxious , " said the Mayor , " that you look over New York . I dare say that in Europe you have heard very bad things about us . You may have feared to come over . Now that you are here look us over  --  the biggest corporate municipality in the world . We have here in your profession much to show you . It 's true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been to build a series of large hospitals all over the city . Cincinnati has a great general hospital , and I believe we have plans for one . " But there is the public library and the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the parks . We have a pretty good city , but an awfully bad Mayor . I have crossed the ocean thirty-six times and have seen all the great cities of Europe . Without wishing to say anything about your cities I will say that New York is one of the most decent and orderly cities M the world , " There are people here who wish to make this city seem the most despicable ' and wicked in the world . And yet they live here . Out of 150 people of that kind I think 149 ought to be Mayor . " I 'm very glad to come here as Mayor of this city . I understand you still have your sea lege on ? if you understand me. 1 see that you do . You 're able to speak a good many languages in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Instead of 200 of you I wish there were 400 of you to welcome . These international congresses for scientific purposes are doing a great deal of good . I would not mention the yellow journals if the Chairman had not lugged them in by the heels , but although you will not find one line about your coming in the yellow journals , that does not mean that this city is not very much awake to your being here . , These international meetings stim , w late the investigation which is doinrae much to advance the study of hygiene and medicine all over the world . Why , it is only a few Years ago that we had the scourge of yellow fever . In New Orleans and other Southern cities it was particularly horrible , but owing to the advance in science we do n't know it any more . Recently we have built the Panama Canal . When De Lesseps went there every square foot became a grave for some man . Now the canal zone is as healthy as New York , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . " So if ' we look back 100 years or 200 or 300 years what a horrible sight the world presented : smallpox , cholera , the black death and strange diseases which consumed half the population of a city in Europe in a few weeks . These have all disappeared . " Regarding yellow fever I understand that it was carried about by the mosquito and so science got hold of the mosquito . Not long ago if a King had smallpox his death was certain . Now we cute a Peasant of it or a poor patient on the east side in New York . " Why , if you keep on nobody will die of anything . We 'll live forever , which will be very monotonous .
