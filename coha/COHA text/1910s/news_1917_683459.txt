It must have been with a heavy heart that Kaiser ICAAL , who longs for peace , signed that duplicate of Kaiser WILHELM 'S reply to the Pope which is Austria 's answer . The two replies differ only in wording : they are identical otherwise , and the identity is of German manufacture , not Austrian . Sift them down and you will find in them , after an unctuous acceptance of the Pope 's desire for the substitution of morality for lust in international relations , nothing but an attempt to take advantage of the Pope 's note to force the disbandment of the British Navy ; and what interest has Austria in that bogus issue of " the freedom of the seas " that should make her go on fighting when she wants peace ? The Pope proposed disarmament ; Germany smoothly " shares his Holiness 's view " that the nations should agree to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the air , " and to secure " the true freedom and community of the high seas " ; for the phrase " the true freedom of the coma ' inanity and high seas " is obviously an error of transmission . This is the only real suggestion for peace that stands out hi the welter of pious words . Austria , too , perforce , whatever terms of peace she . may long to offer , is constrained to suppress them and talk of her desire that the nations should " attain complete freedom of movement on the high seas . " This , then , is the issue of the war as Germany pretends to see it and forces Austria to pretend to see it . But that is not the issue ; the issue is the false and ruthless character of the German Government , which will not leave the world at peace and can not be trusted to keep any promise . The saacoast of Germany , Austria , Turkey , and Bulgaria combined is an infinitesimal fraction of the world 's coast line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrinkage would not be noticeable on any globe or atlas ; search would have to be made for it . Yet they are the only countries that are concerned about " the freedom of the seas . " No other country , enemy or neutral , has ever noticed that its freedom is restricted . Since the world is so well satisfied with the freedom it . has on the seas , is the war to continue until this almost undiscoverable fragment of coast line is satisfied about its own freedom ? But the truth is that Germany is as free on the seas , in time of peace , as England is . The British Navy . a great weapon in time of war and necessary to the safety . of the human race when German aga grdssion threatens it . Interferes in time of peace with no nation 's free use of the seas . What Germany means by securing " the freedom of the seas " is shown in her proposal that there be a " simultaneous and reciprocal " limitation of armaments on land . in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that is the heart , the core , the nub of that whole assemblage of fine phrases . Let Britain disband her navy or reduce it , so that when Germany next sets out to conquer the world she will not find that navy in her way . If a German republic . or a German monarchy responsible to the people , were to propose disarmament and arbitration as a way out of this war , all the belligerent nations would at once censerit , and gladly , to a peace contaat ' should arrange it . But the reason they are fighting Germany is because her Government is not only ruthless but:also false and treacherous ; Weans ? its word is worthless . They will not accept at its hands one More scrap : Of paper , whether that scrap of paper bears old words , such as " the neutrality of Belgium , " or nirW odes , " ' like disarmament and arbitration . " Suppose the present German Government should solemnly agree to arbitrate/all future quarrels , - does any man in his senses suppose that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disarm . would any other nation disarm because of that promise ? ? . r Cardinal.GAspAnaz , apparently seeing which violates it shall be boycotted . But four fifths Of the world it boycotting Germany now for the violation of its agreements , and not only boycotting her but fighting her . Does that deter her ? If it does not deter her now , will it in the future ? No negotiation can be entered into with the present German GoVernment , because it would not carry out any - agreement not to its interest . If the German people will put forward a Government that can be trusted , the world will listen to its proposals id no such skeptical spirit as it listens to those put forward today . If they not do so , then the present Gertnan . Government must be beaten Until it makes no difference what terms it will agree to and what terms it will not . At present . Germany proposes nothing execpt that the war be ended by a promise . on Germany 's part to reduce its army reciprocally with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a promise that England reduce its navy , a promise which Germany would expect/ngland faithfully to fulfill ; and a promise of the- nations to arbitrate in future , a promise that Germany would laugh to scorn the , moment it suited her .. She sees the issue of the war as " the freedom of the seas , " seas that are as free in times of peace to Germany as they are to England , and this is an issue which does not concern in the least the rest of the world , not even Austria . The rest of the world sees the German Government as the issue . The German Government knows it well , and the whole reply to the Pope , dictated in Berlin and . transcribed with forebodings in Vienna , is merely an effort to save Hohenzollernisrn.
