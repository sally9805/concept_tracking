txt The busiest of all the American troop departments these days is the Quartermaster 's , which is working almost feverishly to perfect its system of supplying the men with all the necessities . The work has goneahead so fast that the Quartermaster already has a three months ' supply of all foods within a short distance of the camp and a constant ten days ' supply here . The troops are still eating the dark French bread which is being paid for with American flour , but within , three days bakeries will have been ' established , and the rations will change to white bread with a heavy crust , that makes it transportable and durable . The American Army will , then be the only one in Europe rating white bread . It is today the biggest meat consumer , as the men receive a ration of twenty ounces daily . The American soldiers are now living on the field ration , which consists of twenty ounces of fresh beef daily , or twelve ounces of bacon , OP sixteen ounces of canned meat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft or eighteen ounces of hard bread , or flour or beans ; twenty ounces of potatoes , with a similar amount of onions or tomatoes ; an ounce and a quarter of coffee and three ounces of sugar , with salt , pepper and syrup , as well as prunes , dried apples or peaches or jam . When the supplies all arrive there will also be butter , which will be distributed as an extra on special occasion . The entire plan of the Quartermaster 's Department is to be entirely independent of the French at the earliest date possible , so as to be no burden either to the Government or the population . The department is still trying to decide what to do with the gift made by the Freak ) .

There is a considerable quantity of champagne and red wine for each soldier and officer , but for the present the authorities have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wines would be in violation of the spirit of the recent legislation covering the question of liquor to soldiers . So far , the troops have been rigidly held to water , even though the difficulties of filtering are considerable . Refrigerating plants will be necessary both for water and food supplies , and recommendations for the construction of these plants have already gone forward . Practice today began early , as usual , despite dismal weather . It included anti-aircraft practice , which was pronounced highly successful . The first death occurred at the camp yesterday , when Private Nolan of the infantry was drowned . The latest development of the camp is a Post Office , which will enable men to mail letters either home or to any other point in the world , to keep in constant communication with friends without revealing their exact whereabouts by the tell-tale cancellation mark on envelopes , and to receive mall either through families or friends who do not know what the destination of their letters may be .

Similarly return mail should be addressed to the training camp of the American expeditionary forces , Paris , whence it will be forwarded to the proper address . When the troops left their base they took with them surplus supplies which are now being turned back to the Quartermasters Department headquarters for redistribution , so that there will soon be more than enough of such things as tobacco and similar little luxuries which have been somewhat scarce among some troops and sections . Officers who billeted among the inhabitants are still billeting at the moderate prices that prevail for the majority : They may by request pay one franc daily for quarters and provided they eat at a " hotel " expend seven francs daily for excellent food . Prices are thus kept low to prevent a repetition of events early in the war when allied troops in French territory accustomed to city prices all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them moderate but really enormous rates for everything .
