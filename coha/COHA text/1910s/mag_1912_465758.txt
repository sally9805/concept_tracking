WHEN the Reviewer came in , with a formless bulk of books , large and small , under his arm , something besides weariness in his glazing eye challenged the ever-sympathetic interest of the Easy Chair . " You have got a queer assortment of shapes there . " we said ; and we added , " Well ? " " Yee , " the Reviewer answered , weighed down into the window-seat by his load , " but no queerer than the assortment of kinds . I was just wondering why there could not be some law of the trade which should govern publishers in their output so as to make them give us histories at one season , essays at another , travels at another , poems at another , and BO on , instead of heaping us indiscriminately with them all at once , regardless of the solstice . " " If you really want to know why , " we responded , " we will tell you . It is because no sort of business is governed by any sort of law , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always a bet , a gamble . Publishers , who are probably the best men and the wisest in the world , next to authors , are peculiarly the prey of anarchical impulse . They never know what the public wants ; the public itself does n't know ; and they chance it . That is the reason why now and then they publish a good book . But tell us , 0 Reviewer , do you observe any law in reading books ? Do you read histories exclusively at one season , essays at another , poems at another ? We observe that you left out fiction altogether . " " I never read fiction now if I can help it . I can not possibly rejoice in the happiness of young persons whose passions are rewarded as if they were the only virtues ; and I no longer find a pleasure in having my heart wrung by their disappointments ; though mostly they are such fools that I ought to be glad of it . " " Then what are you doing with Mr. Arnold Bennett 's Hilda Lessways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ah , that is n't fiction . That 's truth , truth about a girl who is as great a fool as any that romance ever imagined , and yet as real as any that walks the world of living men and women . I do n't care what becomes of her ; there are too many of her , for one thing ; there are so many millions of her going on all the time that when I satisfy myself as to what wrong thing she will do next I can pass to the next thing after it with a light heart . I 'll own she keeps me interested . Her author has made a great find in her . He has divined the girl , new to his dreadful trade of novelist , who is generously and ambitiously wishful to be to the world of men what a younger sister tries to be to her elder brother ; she is all will to know , to serve , to devote herself . Of course she is a fool , but she is a sublime fool . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in love with her ; but even at my age I should n't want to marry her . Besides , she is not the only thing in the book . She belongs to a whole order of things which I do n't find falsely noted in a single feature . She is so essentially of her belongings and surroundings and so texturally of the make of her associates that the author is not tempted to work her , to show her off as a phenomenon . As I read the book I was inclined to put it below Claylianger ; but now I do n't know that I should . " " Ah ! And that reminds us of that question of the times and terms of your reading ? You must read a lot . Though , of course , there is such a thing as skipping . " " I do n't skip much ; I never could . I always wanted the agility for it . I do n't say the dishonesty ; I 've been dishonest enough in other ways . But if you want the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly read in bed : to put myself asleep or to keep myself awake ; to fight away from the awful thinking that living comes to when it lasts long , or too long . " At this point we reached for a block of the paper which we keep for lightning-notes , and were about to flash one down , when the Reviewer arrested the bolt . " No , no ! Do n't make that the text of an Easy Chair paper this time . My books happen this time to be more important than my habits of reading . " " Why , what else have you ? " we asked , suspending our pencil in mid-air . " Rather an old book , for me . It 's been out more than six months . The Mediceval Mind , by Henry Osborn Taylor . Do you know it ? " " We must have known it six months ago ; but now we have enough to do in knowing the books of six days ago . We have forgotten it , of course . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your crass patriotism , I wonder you have n't remembered it as a monument of American scholarship , if nothing else . We do n't excel much in studies that penetrate the past to its furthest recesses on given lines of inquiry , direct and divergent , and restore it to us in a synthesis animated by intelligent tolerance and humorous patience . " " Does any other scholarship excel in all those ways ? " " Well , no . One thinks of a German possibly diving deeper but coming up drier . A Frenchman would see things as keenly , but not the fun of them . An Englishman could have as much thoroughness , but he would not have the constant gaiety ? I do n't find another word for it ? the joyous detachment , the delicate bonhomie , the charm ? " " Oh , come ! " we said . " Charm ? in two octavo volumes of more than five hundred pages each , and treating of topics like Greek Philosophy as the Antecedent of the Patristic Apprehension of Fact ; First Stage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monasticism ; The Hermit Temper ; Symbolism ; Latinity and Law ; Ultimate Intellectual Interests of the Twelfth . and Thirteenth Centuries ! " We had possessed ourselves of the books , and were reading at unhandsome haphazard from their tables of contents . The Reviewer waited in smiling security . " Yes , charm , " he insisted . " For those subjects , and others that you have maliciously omitted , embrace the whole of European life for nearly a thousand years , when human knowledge reverently traced itself to the classic world , and devoted itself to an ideal of the spiritual world which this world unworthily adumbrated . Yes , there is fascination in this vision of a time when men lived for a future life in their desire for knowledge , but disavowed all earthly desire for it . You choose to ignore the beautiful and august figures which illumine it , and the amusing personalities which render it tolerable and even lovable in the retrospect , but these incomparable volumes abound in the study of such martyrs and mystics , and poets and zealots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their time , and justly in relation to our time and to all time . You may be so spoiled by modern fiction that you do not care for the appealing realities of the past ? " " Not so bad as that ! " we protested . " You may n't feel the killing pathos of the chapters on Mallard and FIelolse , or the synthetic importance of the chapter on Dante ? " " Yes , yes ; we do , " we put in . " But even you ca n't refuse to enjoy that delicious chapter on The World of Salimbene , or the sub-satirical study of the sentimentalism of St. Francis . I do n't suppose any other time and place than ours would have given the author such a point of view as his , or any other civilization or environment would have produced him , with his peculiar smiling earnestness which is not bound to be always serious , far less solemn . What I feel to be the inalienably American ( I begin to hate that word ) quality of him and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our national nature : he can not help enjoying the absurdity of the inevitable contrasts in his most modern mind , his most occidental mind ; but he does not seek it ; rather it seeks him , and not only obliges him to a smile , but his reader to a burst of laughter . There are places enough betweenwhiles for pity and wonder . The chapter on the Mystic Visions of Ascetic Women , with their realization of Christ as their bridegroom , so exalted , and yet so reduced to the terms of rapturous earthly love ; and that ensuing fine chapter on The Spotted Actuality , mirroring the black and white mundane conditions in which the ultramundane aspirations result through our poor fallible nature , are passages which testify to the author 's inclusive reach , and his subtle ability to express the finest meaning of his facts . Then in that final chapter on The Mediceval Synthesis , which is the most masterly analysis of Dante , the graphic humor of the author culminates in the saying that in the poet 's dedication to Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " " That is charming . But , in two words , what is scholasticism ? " " In two words ! What a monstrously impossible demand ! Read Mr. Taylor , and in five or ten thousand words , but not a word too many , you will know it for a philosophy which abjured reasoning in the very region where believing could not avail . " " It seems to us , " we pondered , " that that way madness lies . ' " " Exactly ! " the Reviewer exulted . " Somewhere in one of his travel-studies , being ' wrought upon in the extreme ' by the insistence of a certain aspect of the Middle Ages , Mr. Henry James confesses that the men of the medieval world seem , to him , simply mad ; and scholasticism seems to have been excogitated by brains that were turned . Men groped so long in the blackness of the Dark Ages that when the kindly light of philosophy from the antique world began to diffuse itself in the aer cieco of their dismal state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . It was a mad world , my masters ! " " And it 's the study of such a world in Mr. Taylor 's thousand pages that you hold out as a supreme pleasure ? What would a tired business man ? " At this the Reviewer exploded in violances unfit for print , but the sum of his explosion seemed to be that if the tired business man had any mind at all he would find more rest to it in that study than in even a musical comedy or some latest phase of symbolic dancing that included bare feet . We laughed tolerantly , but said we did not suppose that , after all , a business man was the dullest or densest of our kind , or of much worse taste than , say , a skilled laborer . Then we took up a favorite thesis of ours , to the effect that the commercial life was more abounding in sweetness and light than it generally bad the credit for ; and as we proceeded , an assenting smile broke over the clouded brow of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we said , " is to find out the truth about it , and perhaps business would appear as attractive and important as scholasticism . Of course we know that just now business men are not the favorite exemplars they were at the time , thirty or forty years ago , when each of us was beginning millionaire . Now , if the story of every great business could be told with the gentleness , the fullness , the fairness of the story of The House of 7farper , for instance ? " " For instance r the Reviewer exclaimed . " Was there ever another business story like it ? " He took the volume from the bulk of books in his lap and shook it illustratively at us . " It 's almost the history of our national literature , of our literary epoch . We began to read and write , to think and feel for ourselves almost at the very time when Harper &; Brothers began to print for us . If they had printed for or from us alone they could not have marketed books enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole Englishwriting world . But before they became Harper &; Cousins and Harper Second Cousins , they made a law to themselves , in the absence of statute , by which they began to pay back to alien authors the forced loans of earlier days ; and nothing is sweeter to read of in this pleasant book than the growth of the kindly relations of these great American publishers with those great English authors . There is hardly one of them but in some friendly form testifies to the kindness which the Harpers were able to establish between commerce and literature by the exercise of the good-will which seemed born in them . They were no Cheeryble Brothers ; they did not squander their substance or affection without reasonable hopes of return ; their benevolence was not sentimentalized ; their motives were practical , qwq
