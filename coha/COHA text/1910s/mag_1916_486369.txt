Mr. Roosevelt 's speech at Wilkes-Barre on Saturday on the Eight-Hour law was very telling on the merits of that question . In the vigor and emphasis with which he dwelt upon the mischief of rushing through a bill of great importance without inquiry or ade  --  quate debate and virtually under duress , he surpassed anything said on that subject by Mr. Hughes  --  whose name , by the way , Mr. Roosevelt forgot to mention . If the Colonel had stopped with his main argument , his address would scarcely be open to criticism . But , of course , he could not let it go at that . He felt compelled to add a good deal of abuse of the President , and insinuation against him . And he had also to explain at wearisome length how infallibly right he himself had always been in dealing with labor troubles . Moreover , in his direct ap  --  peal to labor unions , there is an inevitable air of saying to them : " Do n't forget that Codlin 's the friend , not Short . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have brought an incredulous smile to the faces of his hearers . He declared that if President Wilson had insisted upon arbitra  --  tion , and threatened to use all his power to keep traffic going , " I would have applauded him and supported him . " Persons expert in Curb betting inform us that the odds against that would be at least 1,000 to 1 . The good stuff in Mr. Hughes came out tri  --  umphantly at Louisville . He would not run away from a fair question . He gave it a square answer . With more vigor and with more effect than have marked any of his previous utterances about the sinking of the Lusitania , he gave his audience an idea of what he really thinks of that crime , and what steps he would have taken , if he had been President , to prevent it . The whole de  --  liverance was made man-fashion , and in the spirit which Mr. Thighes 's friends had hoped that he would display more often in this campaign . And the reception of his straight talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew manliness when they saw it . The Republican managers ought to hire that Kentucky heckler to go along on Mr. Hughes 's train and draw from the candidate other utterances as downright as that of last Thursday . Perhaps in time he might be got to echo President Wilson in declaring that he neither courted the favor nor feared the displeasure of any foreign-born group in this country who forgot their American allegi  --  ance . Mr. Hughes , we may add , could dothis with perfect safety . He could not now alienate the bitter extremists among the German-Americans , even if he tried to . They have only one motive  --  to punish Wil  --  son  --  and they would vote for Gen. Brussiloff or Gen. Haig , if necessary , in order to do it . We do n't think the public will take much interest in the row between Norman Hap-good and Victor Ridder . The statements on either hand are not edifying . When it comes down to a petty wrangle , with accusations of lying shot back and forth , over the ques  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote , outsiders can do little more than express their incredulity and disgust . It is a mess which should never have been stirred up . But behind all the per  --  sonalities , and the charges and counter  --  charges , there stands one ugly fact , disclosed afresh by this squabble , in which the pub  --  lic is bound to take a keen interest . And this is the fact that there is an attempt to solidify German-Americans in the coming election , and have their vote cast in blind anger against the President of the United States . This is the really sinister aspect of the case ; and none of the quarrelling about who began it or who sought to get political advantage out of it can alter the bad im  --  pression which has been made and which is deepening every day . And we believe that the more the leaders of the German-Ameri  --  cans brandish their anti-Wilson votes , as if they were so many knives , the greater will be the likelihod that enough resentful Amer  --  icans will be found more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no mistaking the depth of feeling in the attack of John M. Parker , Progres  --  sive candidate for Vice-President , upon that Party 's founder and former leader . Nor will the most completely reconciled Progressive-Republicans deny that he speaks the mind of not a few of the come-outers of 1912 who thought they had enlisted for a war and not for a single campaign . The speech is all the more forcible for its lack of vitupera  --  tion , especially as it is cruelty itself in its use of the deadly parallel between what the Colonel and Perkins said repeatedly and what they did last June . Mr. Parker is under no delusions as to who did the deserting that disrupted the Colonel 's Own Corps , and he is equally clear upon the course to be taken by those still following the colors . Where there is a Progressive party ticket , let the men and women who retain their convic  --  tions on the party 's principles vote for it , regardless of their chances of success . For President , let them vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indig  --  nation at their betrayal by marking the bal  --  lot for Wilson . Both the strength and the weakness of Mr. Parker 's position consist in the fact that he talks and acts like a Pro  --  gressive of 1912 . Defeated for nomination in his own par  --  ty , ex-Gov . Blease , of South Carolina , pro  --  poses to follow the course taken under sim  --  ilar circumstances by other distinguished Americans , including Hearst , Sulzer , and the Colonel , and form a little party of his own . His friends have called a convention for the 24th . The name of the new party , or fac  --  tion , as some South Carolina newspapers dis  --  respectfully term it , has not been selected , but none is necessary . " Bleasites " is already a familiar word outside the State of its origin , as well as within it . Let us have the Bleasite party . That would have the advan  --  tage of candor over the names usually chosen for personal parties , such as the American party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The platform might be a brief phrase , " Just Blease . " But it would be cruel to confine the smallest party to so short a statement of what it is after . Blease has issued several platforms , the latest one , un  --  der date of February 22 , containing a lot of demands with most of which almost every citizen of South Carolina agrees . This deep  --  ens the mystery of six defeats for the ad  --  vocate of these demands , to two victories . It looks as if there must be something about Blease ' himself which is not altogether en-gaging Massachusetts Republicans have defeated a woman-suffrage plank , despite the declara  --  tion in the national platform favoring " the extension of the suffrage to women . " But the debate on the proposal is more interest  --  ing than the action taken . The sponsor for the plank pointed out that there are 4,000 , ? 000 voters wondering which party they shall stand with in the future . " We want their support when the time comes  --  and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise  --  we want their support with the Republican party , " he told the Convention . He was answered by Congressman Welsh , who reminded him that last year , on the referendum , there were 458,000 votes on the question of granting the suffrage to women , and 465,000 votes on the leading candidates for Governor , and that , in this evidently full expression of opinion , suffrage was defeated by 133,000 . There seems to be no doubt that when the people of Massachusetts show that they wish to give the ballot to women , the Republicans will be found standing firmly upon a plank in which the right to it is uncompromisingly asserted . The way to non-partisan election of judges is hard . Chicago voters will be unable to vote blindly for Municipal Court judges by merely making a mark to indicate whether they prefer Wilson or Hughes . They will have to make a mark on a separate ballot if they wish to vote for judges . But as that ballot also is arranged in party columns , the step away from partisanship is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the length of the step , but its direction , that counts in these things , and the politicians showed how they regarded the innovation by attacking it promptly and energetically in the Illinois Su  --  preme Court . The Court refused to hear the plea  --  it is suggested that the reason was that the time before election was too short for a full examination of the issues involv  --  ed . The Legislature will only be proceeding logically if at its next session it finishes the job it has begun by doing away with the party column on judicial ballots . Chicago , like New York , has relied upon the make  --  shift device of bi-partisan tickets for the elec  --  tion of judges , but this year the arrangement fell through in both cities . In a recent bulletin of the Department of Health of New York is a statistical item of special interest . It is that which tells of the low rate of infant mortality in New York city during the first thirty-seven weeks of this year  --  ending September 23 ? in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ber of deaths of-children under one year of age was less by 942 than in the correspond  --  ing period of last year ; and even in the most active period of the epidemic , the four  --  teen weeks from June 24 to September 23 , the deaths of babies were fewer by 385 than in the like portion of 1915 . The explana  --  tion of so remarkable a result which Is sug  --  gested by the Department is that the de  --  crease " would seem to show better care given to babies in general , on account of the anxiety of mothers because of the polio  --  myelitis epidemic . " It is not often that a dark cloud has a silver lining of so sub  --  stantial a character ; but there is no reason that we know of why the extra care given to babies should not account for the result , at least in large part . The reduction of infant mortality which has been going on at so remarkable a rate in New York for many years has been brought about by many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been the patient and energetic work of those who have been spreading among the mothers in the poorer and more ignorant classes knowledge of how their children can be protected against sickness . What these guides have been imparting by express in  --  struction , the presence of a disease which all persons have been told is promoted by negligence and dirt must have impressed with tremendous force . The latest reminder of how great a duty rests on this country in the relief of suffer  --  ing in Europe is contained in a cable dis  --  patch to the New York Times telling of the injury that impends upon 1,500,000 children of school age in Belgium and the subjugated portion of northern France who are suffer  --  ing from inadequate nutrition . As the case is put by Mr. George Barr Baker , of New York , a member of the Commission for Re  --  lief in Belgium , who is conferring with com  --  mittees at Rome on the subject , " the ques  --  tion is either to have a generation of partial  --  ly deficient citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . " It can not be too often stated that , generous as many individuals have been , and incalcula  --  ble as has been the good done by the men and women who have been giving their per  --  sonal services , our aid has not come any  --  where near either the needs of this time of unparalleled calamity or the potentialities of our overflowing abundance . And we shall never come up to what our duty and our opportunity alike direct until there has been somehow organized a systematic collection of funds . There are thousands of Americans who have been prosperous beyond all expec  --  tation and who would be glad to give in generous measure out of their superfluity if their duty and opportunity were effectively brought home to them , but who will not give until it is made plain that there is a clear prospect of accomplishing a grand result by well-concerted action . What is needed above all is a strong and energetic organization di  --  rected towards the raising of money from those in a position to give large sums . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against an economic war after the war of arms to be confused with a plea for an inconclusive peace . Replying to the at  --  tacks which have been made against his warning speech , he points out that in that speech he had taken care to say that the sub  --  ject of policy after the war could not be ex  --  pected to attract much interest at this time , because the attention of the public is " naturally concentrated , first and foremost , upon winning a complete and final victory in the present war . " For peace based on a stalemate or an inconclusive victory , Bryce has no more tolerance than have the foment  --  ers of a policy calculated to perpetuate hate and discord . But what he sees , and what we may be sure minions of Englishmen will be made to see in due time , is that for the victory to be really complete it is essential that what has been gained by unfaltering de  --  termination in the conduct of the war shall not be lost by a short-sighted indulgence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terms of peace or in the nation 's policy after the war . Between those " who preach the doctrine of trade wars to follow the war of arms , and unending national hatreds , " and those who desire that victory shall not only be complete in the field but shall se  --  cure enduring peace and not one which will " sow the seeds of future wars , " says Lord Bryce , the common-sense of the country will judge . A few leaders of opinion , arousing the intelligence and the virtue of the coun  --  try to a sense of the appalling evil that may be invited by a false public policy after the war , may do a service such as it is rarely given to wise and far-sighted patriots to render to their country and to the world . The dispute over the holding up of neu  --  tral mails , though not one of the most im  --  portant , is one of the most vexatious and difficult , that the war has presented to our country . What answer our Government will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now handed to Secretary Lansing by the British Ambassador on behalf of his own and the French Government , or when that answer will be made , it is impossible to say . The difficulty in the case , as in so many oth  --  er issues of the kind , is that elements are involved which are almost irreconcilable . The right to search for matter which , if transmitted to the enemy , would assist him in the prosecution of the war is , in a gen  --  eral way , admitted all round ; the limits to the steps which it is permissible to take in asserting that right are , on the other hand , extremely indefinite and may be the source of endless controversy . The belligerents wish to stretch those limits to the utmost ; the United States , in the interest of neutral rights , seeks to keep them within the bounds set by unchallenged precedent . The most that can be said for the progress thus far made in the correspondence is that it has narrowed the subjects of dispute down to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be accorded to first-class mail carried on neutral ships and marked for a neutral destination , and the question of the contraband or non-contraband char  --  acter of postal money-order lists  --  these lat  --  ter being declared in the Anglo-French note to be virtual transmittals of money , while our own Government asserts that they are merely ordinary letters . The opinion is more or less current in Washington circles that part of the destroyer flotilla which has been sent out from New  --  port has been assigned to the duty of keep  --  ing near the White Star liner Adriatic , so as to render assistance to her passengers in the event of an attack . If this be true , it opens up a most serious prospect in relation to our policy on the issue of submarine " cruiser warfare . " So long as United States ships of war rescued passengers and crews set adrift in open boats near our own shores , the view might be held that the lives of non-combat  --  ants had not been put into serious jeopardy by the submarine 's proceedings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naval com  --  manders were merely making assurance of safety more complete . In mid-ocean nothing of the kind can be said . If a German sub  --  marine destroys a merchant ship far out in the Atlantic , deliberately counting on the performance by the United States navy of a duty which imperatively falls upon . the sub  --  marine under the requirements of interna  --  tional law , a duty in default of ability to per  --  form which the submarine 's act of destruc  --  tion becomes a manifest crime , then our standing by to help becomes an explicit act of assistance to Germany in the destruction of our own legitimate commerce with the Allies . The problem presented by this aspect of the situation  --  even if the conjecture about the Adriatic is altogether without warrant ? is one that demands the instant and ener  --  getic attention of the Administration . " Dismissed " was the word employed in the German official announcement of the re  --  tirement of von Falkenhayn from the post of Chief of the Great General Staff . The quali  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed for duty elsewhere did not , to some observers , atone for the brutality of the original formula . Now it ap  --  pears that von . Falkenhayn 's duty elsewhere was the very important duty of clearing the Rumanians out of Transylvania to be fol  --  lowed , no doubt , by an invasion of Rumania . To that end the two chief engineers of the Russian debtiele of 1915 are cooperating , von Falkenhayn from the Carpathians and von Mackensen from south of the Danube . The former received the opportunity to atone in the field for errors of judgment with re  --  gard to Verdun , and is making full use of his chance . The mystery of the word " dis  --  missed " remains , but the incident does il  --  lustrate the discipline that prevails in the German military system from the bottom up . In England , Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien has gone into virtual retirement , and Gen. French has received the rather nominal post of commander of the home forces . But the Kaiser may remove his generals and yet make use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Personal susceptibilities are not allowed to count . Another of Germany 's organizers of vic  --  tory is no longer at his post . This is Dr. Walther von Rathenau , who was in charge of the industrial mobilization of German re  --  sources , and whom the enthusiastic foreign correspondent was inclined to endow with miracle-working powers . Under Rathenau 's magic wand the synthetic rubber tree burst into sudden bloom and from his silk hat he drew substitutes for cotton and nitrogen and copper at the order of the War Office . Yet the Deutschland did not disdain to car  --  ry back rubber and copper in her limited cargo . We have no facts to account for Rathenau 's leaving his post ; personal rea  --  sons may explain it . The one improbable reason is that he had so well done his work that there was no need of his services for the rest of the war . The magic of Rathenau was the magic of hard work and special training , and of that kind of miracle work  --  er the Kaiser has unlimited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the announcement put forth some time ago by the Associated Press of King Constantine 's decision to enter the war on the side of the Allies was premature . The seizure of part of the Greek fleet by the Al  --  lies , and the demand for the dismantling of the coast defences , show how lively is Al  --  lied distrust of Constantine 's intentions . High-handed the procedure unquestionably is , but it is in line with the collapse of na  --  tional Greek authority which has been long a fact . With Germany making peaceful prison  --  ers of Greek troops , the Allies taking over Greek ships , and half the country in revolt under Venizelos , the dictates of interna  --  tional propriety have long gone by the board . There is , however , this important consideration in favor of the Allies : that popular Greek sentiment , as expressed by Venizelos , is with them , as it has been from the beginning . The contract between the Chinese Govern  --  ment and American interests for the build  --  ing of more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railway extension entered upon during the present year in China , after a two years ' suspension of ac  --  tivity brought about by the war . There are now 6,467 miles of railway in operation , with 2,300 miles under construction , though " construction " has made very little progress in the last two years . Altogether , the Gov  --  ernment 's railway programme calls for 14,500 miles of railway , of which 6,000 miles will be begun when the state of the inter  --  national money market permits . Concessions have been distributed among all the Powers . Since 1913 contracts provide for nearly 2,000 miles of railway under French supervision , 2,100 miles under British supervision , sever  --  al hundred miles in Shantung under German supervision , a Japanese extension of 52 miles in southern Manchuria , and 660 miles of Russian lines in northern Manchuria . The last contract was signed in March . The bal  --  ance sheet for the Chinese Government rail  --  ways in 1915 showed a profit of more than $8,000,000 on receipts of a little more than $56,000,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York Sun sees it , will come in connection with Japanese rights in California . And how is this shown ? By the fact that Count Terauchi " is no doubt sin  --  cere in his statement that he will not de  --  part from the policy of his predecessor . In reality it was not the policy of Count Okuma , but the demand for its effective execution , that was the chief cause of the political dif  --  ferences in Japan . " But what was this pol  --  icy of Count Okuma ? California ? Not at all . Under Count Okuma there have been no controversies over California 's anti-alien laws . The Japanese Government has carried out the gentlemen 's agreement to keep emi  --  grants out of the United States , and this Country has been satisfied . Criticism against Okuma in Japan has been directed towards his Chinese policies . The opposition at Tokio is disgruntled with Japan 's supposed back-down in her demands on the Chinese Gov  --  ernment . A more vigorous policy has been asked for in southern Manchuria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in to do effectively what Okuma did ineffectively , his interests must be directed to China , and not across the Pacific to California . Even if Okuma had been concerned with the Amer  --  ican problem , Terauchi 's advent would have meant a change . He is identified completely with Japanese expansionist plans in Asia .
