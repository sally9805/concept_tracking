txt Before Harriman took bold of the Union Pacific , rebuilt the entire structure , and built its treasury up to $200,000,000 , it was declared by the win who had managed the property from the beginning that the days of the prosperity of the Union Pacific had passed , never to return ; that Argentina and India were in competition with American wheat and other foodstuffs , and that nothing could bring the Union Pacific , and the food of the country through which it ran , nearer than 1,500 miles to the Atlantic sea board . Therefore it was argued Union Pacific was doomed . and must measurably return to the great American desert whence it sprang . Today the great American deserts are looked to as never before for the world food supplies . But there is a future in the food supply of the world which must not be overlooked . The United States is making machinery as never before to aid the agriculture of the whole globe , and President Wilson should have every support in keeping down wheat from unreasonable profiteering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Planted as never before and that if the Winter weather had been more favorable , the North American crop might have gone to a billion and a half bushels , or about onehalf the world 's wheat production . Although Canada will not reach her bumper crop of two years ago , 22 bushels per acre are expected from 15,500,000 acres , the enormous crop for that country of 340,000,000 bushels . Canada today prosperous as never before , and destined to be mon. so . The United States will produce about 900,000,00 ) bushels and the whole continent should produce 1.250,000. - 000 bushels . Last year 's deficient crops were helped oat by the surplus of the previous year . There is now no surplus to speak of and wheat prices may be . well sustained in these war straits . It is , however , an unworthy remark that the Republicans expect to win votes this Fall in the wheat state ; turbed one very eminent lawyer has been because of accubecause Mr. Wilson would not permit higher wheat prices , and the Republicans should promptly repudiate it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support to the war , which must mean full support to the President in every war effort and the curbing of all excesses . We must all look forward to the time when " the great American desert " again faces world wheat competition , and the next competition may be the sharpest in food production and prices that the United States has ever known . When the United States attempts to raise a billion bushels ? I wheat or nearly one-third of the world'a wheat supply , we should understand that there are three spots in the northern hemisphere that properly developed , can each do better than this . They are Siberia in Asia , Russia in Europe , and the undeveloped northern half of this continent . Present war prices are sufficient incentive to their development and eventual competition . England is raising food as never before in this generation , and Ireland is her ally in food production to unprecedented extent . Indeed , the official report from abroad reads that the British food supply from Ireland " has become the most important in point of quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from any country in the world . What Ireland can do with the most fertile soil in the world and most of the Irish in America is astonishing . Iryland and the United States each sent to Great Britain in 1912 for British consumption $130,000,000 in value of food and drink stuffs , and in 1916 the record for the United States was $580,000,000 , while that of little Ireland was $355,000,000 , computing the pound-sterling on the basis of $5 . Although only 10% of the population , Ireland procuces 40% of the cattle and 30% of the pigs of the United Kingdom . The United States will need some of her new ships to meet in England the future food competition with the supply from Ireland .
