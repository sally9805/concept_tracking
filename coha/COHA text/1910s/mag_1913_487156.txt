Travel is well represented this year among the more festivepublications . Thus " Eothen " ( $3.50 net ) comes from Lippincotts with illustrations by Frank Brangwyn , some of these ornaments for chapter-heads , others full-page color plates pasted in . No travel book out of the Orient , published since 1844 , has equalled Kinglake 's for color and humanity and persuasive veracity , and Mr. Brangwyn has not been disloyal to the spirit of his author . Also of the Orient , and suited to the writer 's sense of color and form , and to his powers of varied description , is Pierre Loti 's " India " , of which George Inman 's translation is of recognized quality As issued in Duffield 's new edition ( $2 50 net ) , the book is finely bound and printed , and a score of illustrations are added from the hand of A. Hugh Fisher , A R.E To these last only a qualified commendation can be allowed Of the frontispiece , from a colored painting in oils , we shall not speak ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazy to the destruction of vividness In the case of another Oriental work , Robert Hichens 's " The Near East Dalmatia , Greece , and Constantinople " ( Century ; $6 net ) , with paintings in color by Jules Guerin , author , illustrator , and publisher have joined to make a notable gift-book . To readers familiar with text and pictures as they ? have appeared serially in the Century , the arresting feature of the volume will be its cover , of Byzantine design , in gold and rich colorings ; but the heavy paper , the large , clear type , and the plates upon which the illustrations are printed all deserve praise . Mr. Hichens 's descriptions are of the most freshness in Turkey , which seems to have appealed chiefly to him ; and the same country has wrought with best effect upon the artist . From the " Arabian Nights " we have the " Princess Radoura " ( Doran ; $3 net ) , retold by Laurence Housman in vigorous English , which , while not absolutely disdaining archaic phrases , gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , supply the necessary atmosphere , Edmund Dulac knows how to represent a scene and ? to furnish a decoration at the same time . His pictures tell a story clearly , as if that were their one aim , and yet from central figure to decorative border there is a wealth of color and design . The present series of illustrations is a worthy addition to the notable list that he has to his credit . Turning from the East to the West , we have Walter Tyndale 's " Artist in Italy " ( Doran ; $5 net ) . When the narrator of a journey paints his own pictures of it , there is not likely ? to be any of that discrepancy too often felt between text and illustration . This harmony of conception is , however , the least of the merits of Mr. Tyndale 's work . The places to be depicted , although limited to Venice and the hill towns of Tuscany , are selected with good judgment , and painted with happy skill . The bright colors of the market-places alternate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects of sunlight upon sea and shore . A new joyous edition of " Lorna Doone " is as fixed an event as Christmas itself . This Year Crowell brings out the novel with sixteen illustrations in color by Christopher Clark ( $2.50 net ) . Although the pages are large , the volume is light . The lover of this romance will be gratified to see how faithfully the illustrator has followed the text , while allowing his imagination full play . Other new novels in holiday dress are not lacking . A clean specimen of these , with colored pictures , but with the look of a thing to be handled and read , is Hardy 's " Under the Greenwood Tree " ( Putnam ; $2 net ) . A still more attractive volume from the same house is " Tom Brown 's School Days " ( $3 net ) , which might be ranged among the children 's books if children can be of all ages . Views of Rugby , inside and out , will make the story more vivid for American readers who are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an edition of " Vanity Fair " ( Doran ; $5 net ) , on which great care has been expended by artist and publisher . In case of so live a character as Becky Sharp , who forms ? the centre of most of the illustrations , opinions will always differ as to how she outwardly appeared at the crucial moments of her career . Yet it may be said for Lewis Baumer 's pictures that they are always interesting , dainty , and piquant , and his colors are pretty without being garish . To the four of Thoreau 's books which the Crowell Company has already published with illustrations by Cliflon Johnson , is familiar with Mr. Johnson 's work will not need to have the many careful photographs in the present volume recommended to them . All are taken in or about Concord ; and vary from snapshots of The Farmer with his Scythe and The Woodchopper 's Dinner , to such bits of pure nature as The Snowy Woodland and Moonlight on Lancaster Meadow . For the most part they chime admirably with the text . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a country road , or the gleam of telephone wires across a shady landscape , reminds us of the distance from our day of the author of " Wild Apples , " " A Walk to Wachusetts , " and " The Succession of Forest Trees . " Emerson 's biographical sketch is printed as an introduction , and the book is bound in appropriate russet and green . The transition from Thoreau to Richard Jefferies is a transition from natural Nature to hectic Nature . And not the least hectic of Jeff eries 's books , though with an interest of its own , is the intensely subjective " Story of My Heart . " E. W. Waite 's pictures for this book , in Dutton 's new edition ( $2.50 net ) , should satisfy the most discriminating . They are not over frequent , being only eight in number ; each is a landscape pure and simple , without human figure or scarcely even the suggestion of human life ; and they are of attractive coloring and outline . Mr. C. J. Longman introduces the book with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time ( 1883 ) the work was first going through the press . In Albert B. Osborne 's " As It Is in England " ( McBride , Nast ; $3 net ) there are again lovely bits of English country and country towns . Mr. Osborne has avoided the cities , because , aside from London , which is too big for his purpose , they do n't interest him . We meet the old standbys , the cathedrals , castles , universities , besides a cosey cottage here and there . Though the text is not distinguished , it forms pleasant reading . For a view of nature as the scene of ae . tive life , and for an attractive holiday book , one may take " Winter Sports in Switzerland " ( Dodd , Mead ; $4 net ) . Skating , skiing , tobogganing , " tailing , " known in this country as " hitching , " and all the other out-of-doors games with which Switzerland makes merry in the winter are well caught in colors by C. Fleming Williams . The rich atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent background of color . Merely to look at all this pictured sport makes one breathe deeply and one 's blood tingle . E. F. Benson , who is something of an authority on these subjects , besides being a writer of novels , furnishes the text , which runs to nearly 200 large pages . Not only is he most informing , he is able to convey the zest which ' the topics demand . We regret that there is room for only one sample : Then the glad word goes forth that the lake bears , and you hurry forth to skate on it . But mountain and wood and landscape are all mirrored in it as in perfectly still water , and it is almost incredible that here is ice a foot or two thick . Tremblingly you launch yourself on it , scarcely able to believe in its solidity ; for through that unwavering surface you see every weed and stump under water . The very fishes flit and flick visibly below your feet .

Detmold . If ' at first glance the colors seem a bit too vivid , closer observation will show that they are in reality calculated with great accuracy . Detailed studies of flowers and birds and insects are the subjects chosen . Perhaps the most attractive of Mr. Mosher 's books this season , both for substance and for form , is a reprint of Alexander Smith 's " Dreamthorp , " in clear type on a clean page , and with no nonsense . Mr. Mosher in his " foreword " speaks of a revival of interest in Smith 's poetry and prose . Of the former , we are not so sure ; it is hard to imagine the world taking the paroxysms of " A Life Drama " very seriously again ; but this " book of essays written in the country " is full of good quiet writing , and has never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well to bring out in a separate volume what is perhaps the most successful work of England 's new laureate , " The Growth of Love . " It is here reprinted in old-style Roman face from the unique edition in Fell 's Old English type ( 100 numbered copies ) , published at Oxford in 1890 ; and will serve both as a timely gift and one of enduring worth . Dr. Bridges 's own attitude towards this sonnet-sequence is expressed in number lviii . It may represent , considering his well-known aversion to publication , something more than conventional self-effacement : 0 my uncared-for songs , what are ye worth , That in my secret book with so much care I write you , this one here and that one there , Marking the time and order of your birth ?

Among Mr. Mosher 's other new publications are Gilbert Murray 's translation of the " Andromache " of Euripides , Mary F. Robinson 's " Songs from an Italian Garden , " and " The Sermon on the Mount . " F. Hopkinson Smith has done text and pictures for " In Thackeray 's London " ( Doubleday , Page ; $3.50 net ) . The text is partly Hopkinson Smith and partly Thackeray , and wholly satisfactory , and the twenty-one full-page pictures in crayon are of a gray , shadowy , rain-soaked London . That is the advantage of England 's capital over every other city . For London the artist need not resort to the expedient of blurring clear outlines and breaking rectilinear angles and covering sunshine with a mantle of mist . London offers all that ready made . It certainly has plenty of atmosphere on an autumn day of fog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which fifteen years of fog and soot produce the most deceiving semblance of antiquity ? Nothing can ever be new in London for more than two or three winters . Mr. Smith starts at the inevitable point ? Charterhous.e and Grey Friars and Col.

New York : Charles Scribner 's Sans . $3 net . The emergence of Gobineau at this date illustrates the caprice which sometimes determines fame . George Meredith , writing to John Morley on February 1 , 1906 , says ?

The tardiness of English recognition need not surprise us . On the Continent , however , Gobineau has king been not only well known , but even the object of a vigorous cult . It is from him , a Frenchman , that the Germans have drawn many of their arguments for militarism and their doctrines as to what constitutes a dominant race For twenty years Gobineau societies have flourished in the Fatherland , " Gobinismus " has taken its place in the vocabulary of accepted political and racial truths , Gobineau 's works have been translated into German , and many essays , critiques , and monographs have poured out upon them . In France also Gobineau long since came to his own His " Renaissance , " crowned by the Academy , has passed through six editions , and his seminal ideas have become common property- but he seems to have been accepted there as a politico-literary thinker , as an artist in pen-portraiture , rather than as the apostle of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decadent and the German as a crescent people may account for the fact that his countrymen , with their usual intellectual hospitality , welcome him as a man of letters rather than as a prophet . Born in 1816 of a noble family , Arthur Gobineau was a bookish youth , and a reader and thinker at the age when most of his class devoted themselves to dissipation In 1848 , he served De Tocqueville as secretary Then he entered the diplomatic career , filling minor posts at Berne , Frankfort , and other places He spent three years as first secretary at Teheran , thereby getting material for his " Histoli e des Perses " For nearly twenty years he alternated between short sojourns in Paris and service at Athens , Rio de Janeiro , Stockholm , and the East . He died in 1882 The year before , he fell in with Richard Wagner , who , captivated by Gobineau 's views on aristocracy and artists , published , in the Bayrelither Blatter , an article by him on " Heroism and Christianity . " This led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who soon came to accept as gospel Gobineau 's laws of race supremacy . These had appeared in his epoch-making book , " Essai sur l'm  --  galit ? des races humaines , " the first volume of which was printed in 1853 , and the second in 1855 . This is not the place for a critique of the " Essai " ; suffice it to say that in it Gobineau investigates why some races have achieved greatness while others have remained mediocre , or have even sunk to be the subjects and slaves of the powerful . He concludes that pirrity of stock accounts for these differences , on which what we call moral consider ations have little influence . That a race is strong is proof enough for him that it ought to be strong ; and its aim should be to go on strengthening itself at the expense of its neighbors . This pleasant doctrine harmonized with the desires of tire " superior " peoples of Europe when they set out , a quarter of a century ago , to subdue or assimilate " inferior " peoples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aristocracy , it also fortified the theory of the Superman which has been exploited during the past two decades . In short , Gobineau had assembled the most characteristic elements in Nietzsche 's system thirty years before Nietzsche himself . These would be reasons enough to explain Gobineau 's importance ; and to them should be added the fact that he was the spokesman of conservatism in its life-and-death struggle with democracy One may , however , read his " Renaissance , " published in 1877 , without a knowledge of these details , for in it Gobineau writes objectively , seeking neither to preach nor to persuade , but simply to exhibit the chief figures of that period in typical acts and utterances He uses the dialogue as his medium , a device which lends objectivity to his portraits and has the advantage of sparing the reader long descriptions and explanations . But mere dialogue does not always result in dramatic quality , and on many occasions it resolves itself into monologues in which , as in Browning 's best examples , we can not always separate the author from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suggestion of the knowledge that comes by retrospect , which the actors themselves could not have had . Nevertheless , the total effect is one of verisimilitude : Gobineau has caught the strange drama of the Italian Renaissance in many of its most marked features , and he has painted them with remorseless veracity . Only a doctrinaire , steeped in Gobineau 's theory of racial and individual supremacy , would discover in " The Renaissance " a glorification of the pessimism which culminates in the Superman If Gobineau chose the wickedest period of modern times because it gave the freest play to individuality , he does not hush up the horrors to which unbridled egotism led The moralist can deduce from him a hundred arguments against the soul-killing license of the Renaissance , arguments just as cogent as , and more savory than , those which Dr. Levy , in his introduction , draws from him . Gobineau devotes his dialogues to the careers of Savonarola , Cnsar Borgia , Julius II , Leo X , and Michael Angelo . Round each of these protagonists he groups a host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beginning with Savonarola , he shows how , when the Roman Church had reachindividualism , freed from moral restraints , was to blossom in a thousand beautiful talents , turns out to be the heyday of primitive lusts , passions , and ferocities . Even the artists , whose work alone remains to gladden posterity , seem mere . accessories to the general orgy of Supermen . But Gobineau does not show us , we do not feel sure that he could show , an inevitable connection between moral and social degeneration and splendid achievements in art . Nevertheless , Gobineau keeps the artist constantly in mind . The one figure who comes and goes through his dialogues is Michael Angelo , with whose death , indeed , he regards the Renaissance as closed . If there be any character in his dramatis personce through whom the author himself seems to speak , it is precisely Michael Angelo We cite two characteristic passages : " I am an artist , " says Buonarotti , " and I see in the world only my work , and above all our holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessed be his name  --  has put on the earth so many princes , captains , and podestas , who devour each other . Their only occupation ought to be to do virtuous deeds , punish vice , and protect the arts They do Just the opposite . God . ought to suppress them It is true that then we should fall into the hands of the populace , the vilest beast that ever crawled on the ground " In that last sentence speaks Gobineau , who had seen the blue-bloused Parisian mob swarm up the boulevards in 1848 , and had thereafter loathed Demos in all his forms . So he puts into Michael Angelo 's mouth , at the close of the book , what we may regard as his own summing up of the Renaissance I knew Brother Savonarola , and the aspect of his august face has never vanished from my memory . I have lived by his teachings Either because he demanded too much of us , or because poor Italy presumed too much upon her forces and imagination in her was disproportioned to honesty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet , nevertheless , she felt herself ; sb , was conscious of her superiority over the rest of the world . She despised'other countries and used their resources for her own ends ; they held her in admiration and she knew it . She knew that she was great and dreamed only of becoming greater Her artists .. . you know what they have been ! Now , all is over The fire is extinguished There exists no Italy more Those whom we disdained become our masters The artists have perished I am the last survivor of the holy phalanx ; what they call by the same glorious name we bore are now only traders , and not without impudence It was time indeed to die ! We die ill , miserably What matter ? There have been beautiful souls , glorious souls in this Italy , henceforth enslaved and prostrate . I do not regret to have lived . .. . We leave great things after us and great examples Earth is richer than she was before we came The restraint of utterance which characterizes this farewell belongs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epigrams . He never resorts to rhetoric to heighten his effects . Though the persons and episodes he describes are among the most extraordinary exemplars of romanticism running riot , Gobineau treats them as a classicist . This does not mean that he disdains realistic touches in order to enhance the lifelikeness of his presentation . Take , for , instance , the Florentine citizen who , at the execution of Savonarola , says to his wife . " It was a pretty fine ceremony , and- even imposing ! But I think it 's going to rain . Let 's go home . " To . which she replies " Yes , my dear , let 's go home ! I am afraid of catching cold . " By such a sardonic stroke  --  and there are many of them ? Gobineau reminds us of the tragic contrast be . tween the supreme moments of human passion and historical crisis , and , the indifference with which dull persons behold them . He never falls into the " pathetic fallacy , " for he knows too well the insensibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has at his command the historical facts , he does not always stick slavishly to historical sequence ; for his purpose is , primarily , to interpret the significance of the Renaissance . So he dates the last interview between Michael Angelo and Vittoria Colonna thirteen years after her death , and in other cases he prefers the spirit to the letter of the records . Occasionally , as in the matter of the poisoning of the cardinals by Alexander VI , investigations made since Gobineau wrote have either raised doubts or reversed earlier opinions . But after all necessary qualifications , " The Renaissance " remains essentially a true book , in which one of the most amazing episodes in history is vividly embodied It extenuates nothing ; it sets down naught in malice ; it leaves you , in the main , to draw your own deductions . If Gobineau had possessed Voltaire 's style , it might have been a literary masterpiece ; but even so , one feels that it must have been easier deliberately td satirize wickedness in " Candide " than to spread dispassionately on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of persons who reveal themselves heart and soul to the life . With Gobineau to personalize the Renaissance , and Burckhardt to generalize its manners , customs , and ideals ; one who is not a specialist can come at its essence . Mr. Cohn 's translation , although not distinguished , is readable , and , wherever we have compared it with the French we have found it trustworthy . Dr. Oscar Levy 's introduction , whether in tone or Substance , is most objectionable . That the fastidious aristocrat Gobineau , who detested vulgarians and disdained to take part in controversies or to defend his views in public  --  leaving his books to speak for him  --  should be championed by a ranting atheist , is irony without mitigation . It is not the atheism that he would object to ; it is the crudity , the lack of knowledge , the vulgarity of manner , the raw-turnip flavor . We infer that Dr. Levy , who is Nietzsche 's English sponsor , venerates Nietzsche , Stendhal , and Gobineau as mankind 's supreme products . His introduction deals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aristocracy , with digressions in which he aims bungling sarcasm at the poor god of the nineteenth century , or assails H. S. Chamberlain , or expatiates on the blunders of " the hopeless Nazarene . " These topics , and many others , have nothing to do with " The Renaissance " Of the two recent books included under our title , Professor Woodward 's " Cesare Borgia " deserves commendation as a solid piece of work . He has examined the authorities without prejudice , and , having canvassed the conclusions of modern historians , he gives his own verdict dispassionately He has the historic sense well developed . His printing of the text of a score of documents adds to the value of his volume , in which , while some of the sensational crimes attributed to the Borgias are disproved or doubted , the general charges against them are confirmed . Mr Christopher Hare is too well-known a bookmaker to require an introduction . He is a popularizer of history through the medium of striking personages . In Maximilian I he takes for his hero the Emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and whose policy led him to meddle in Italy . Mr. Hare has perhaps exaggerated " the dreamer 's " ability and good qualities ; but he is justified in exalting the interest of Maximilian 's career CURRENT FICTION . The Passionate Friends . By H. G. Wells . New York Harper &; Bros . Mr. Wells has hit upon an effective expedient for giving this story an individual atmosphere . Middle-aged Stephen Stratton is supposed to write it for the future benefit of his son , still a child at the time of its writing . So far as it is a confession , it is that of one man to another , outside the conventional relation of father and son . He fears that he may never be able to break down that convention in speech , and that with the years he may " become inaccessible as old people are sometimes inaccessible " ? as his own father has been . But confession is not a word that Mr. Wells uses One needs , in whatever shadowy sense , a conviction of sin for that . Stephen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorrow in the past , looksupon himself as a product , a type of family and race , and sadly yet not despairingly predicts for his son , so like him in body and temperament , an experience not unlike his own . There is much in these pages of Wellsian dreaming about a new fraternity , a new social order , a new world-race The man Stratton at last devotes his life to the great vague cause of progress-byunification . But this comes about half by chance  --  humanity being sought as a refuge from the unhappiness . of an individual . The real story is the old story of a man and two women . Lady Mary is the sweetheart and companion of his youth At first glance , she might be the old-fashioned heroine , the shrinking , beauteous one , longing to be wooed , and helpless in the arms of her lover . But her slenderness , her blue eyes , and golden hair , belong to a very modern person . The first kiss of the young pair is as much her doing as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in mind . She has a stronger consciousness of self than he  --  loves him but will not leave her tower for him : " I do n't want to become some one 's certain possession , " she cries , " to be just usual and familiar to any one . No , not even to you . . . . Do n't you see ? ? I want to be wonderful to you , Stevenage , more than to any one . I want ? I want always to make your heart beat faster . I want always to be coming to you with my own heart beating faster . Always and always I want it to be like that . " So she will not have her Stephen , and , to insure that thrilling attachment , engages herself to another man ' It is understood that the marriage is to be nominal , but that does not console Stephen , and he goes off to South Africa It is not his fault that instead of finding the quietus of a Boer bullet , he returns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . Presently there comes a new intimacy with Lady Mary , lapsing from strained friendship into the entanglement of the flesh . Then follow suffering , scandal , and what the narrator somewhat pretentiously calls " tragedy " in the suicide of Lady Mary . Nobody comes out unscathed , least of all the innocent ( but wise ) Rachel , whom Stratton has married , and for whose son he tells his story . Yet , looking back , he discerns in the figure of Lady Mary , in his own figure , " a symbolical value , " not as sinners from whose sin the world may draw a moral , but as victims of a false civilization  --  beings with " a sense of fine things entangled and stifled and unable to free themselves from the ancient limiting jealousies which law and custom embody " There we are ' Mr. Wells . is but another victim , more intelligent than some others , of that passing belief that somehow happiness is to result for humanity from setting the emotions free of restraint rather than from the deliberate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An Avery age Man By Robert Hugh Ben-son New York : Dodd , Mead &; Co . Mr. Benson has adopted in this book one of the most effective of all modes of religious propaganda  --  the method of what one may call the non-argumentative argument He employs all conceivable means for the making of converts to Catholicism save that of direct exposition of Catholic doctrine He is constantly on the verge of exposition , but he goes no further His characters are often found engaged in heated religious argument , but no sooner do we come upon them than some semi-personal issue arises and takes precedence . And yet one does not have the impression that the author is evasive , or that he avoids the main issue because he can not grapple with it On the contrary , one feels that he has held himself back , that , in deference to the proprieties of the novel , he has not tried to create belief in any other way than by showing the effects of faith , and lack of faith , upon character . When , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn of events has its tactical effect . The very fact that the hero does not after all become a convert , is a part of the general scheme of the book , by which Catholicism takes on the charm of a lost cause and a forsaken belief . The Anglican Church stands for worldly success , for propriety and convention ; the Catholic , in some part through the social disrepute that attaches to it , appears a refuge of spirituality and idealism With a fortune newly acquired , but an appropriate place among county families still to make , the hero finds that CatholiciSm would be too much of a handicap in his career , and beats an inglorious retreat He is , after all , only " an average man .

Peter also was full of courage , but he discovered that " princesses were for fairy-tales  --  that girls want Things . " So Peter determined to get rich and overcome - the dragon Things . He left for New York and struggled for success , forgotten and forsaken even by his dream princess . But as he grew richer and overcame the dragon Things , he felt the need or something beyond riches . When he met Eunice Goodward , he thought she was his long-sought princess .

The author knows the trick . TRUE PROSPERITY . Wealth and Welfare . By A. C. Pigou . New York : The Macmillan Co. $3.25 net . It is a popular delusion , declares Professor Pigou , that while economic science itself is a difficult subject , the discussion of practical problems , in which economic forces play an important part , can safely be undertaken without special preparation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this view . The study of economic theory is , indeed , difficult ; but the application of the knowledge which that study wins to the guidance of practical affairs is an even harder task ; for it needs not only a full understanding of the theory , but also the trained judgment that can balance against one another a large number of qualifying considerations . This would be the case even if human life were such that economic welfare and welfare in general were coincident terms . But , in fact , man does not live by bread alone ; and , therefore , besides estimating the probable economic consequences of his action , a reformer needs always to beware lest , in his ardor to promote economic benefit , he may sacrifice unwittingly some higher and more elusive good . Professor Pigou 's analysis of the task constitutes one of the most painstaking economic works of recent years . The wealth and variety , of information which he employs remind the reader of Adam Smith , as does also the subtlety of his dissections . And one might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair of moral philosophy ; yet one must not expect to find here that almost artless diction which characterizes the most complicated discussions in " The Wealth of Nations . " The reader understands at the start that he has a task before him , but he sees also that the task is well worth the effort . This work might almost be called an analysis of human consciousness ; for Professor Pigou begins by telling us that welfare can belong only to states of consciousness , his aim being to make clear the distinctions between economic welfare and general welfare , and to show the interplay of the two . He tells us , for example , that causes that modifyeconomic welfare may influence other parts of welfare , not directly , but indirectly through objective conditions of welfare other than the national dividend . The most important of these conditions are the services rendered by certain objects of natural beauty , and those rendered by persons , for which no money payment is made . The effect of economic causes on objects of natural beauty is illustrated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or gold , the desecration widely wrought by uncontrolled smoke from factories , and the degraded form frequently assumed by public advertisements . Effects or services rendered . by certain people occur whenever economic causes , such as Poor Law or factory regulations , or fluctuations in the demand for men 's labor , divert women workers from factory work or paid home-work to unpaid home-work , in attendance on their children , economical preparation of the family meals , repair or the family clothes , thoughtful expenditure of housekeeping money , and so on . It is clear , in cases of this kind , that the changes that appear in economic welfare result almost entirely from the definition that Professor Pigou has selected for that term , and do not represent ' any considerable . change in total welfare . For the most part , economic causes act upon economic welfare , not directly , but through the national dividend . The gross national dividend consists of the annual flow of those gbods and services that can easily be brought into relation with a money measure , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appropriate allowance for depreciation of capital . If a cause is introduced which makes for an increase in the aggregate size of the net national dividend , provided that the absolute share of no group of members , in terms of the commodities which that group is accustomed chiefly to consume , decreases , the economic welfare of the community as a whole is likely to be augmented . If a cause is introduced which makes for an increase in the absolute share of relatively poor groups of persons , provided that the magnitude of the aggregate national dividend does not decrease , economic welfare is likely to be augmented . If a cause is introduced which diminishes the variability , or inequality in time , of the dividend , and especially of that part of it which accrues to the poorer classes , economic welfare is likely to be augmented . On these theses the present work is built up . The argument is too closely knit , is the product of too many streams of observation and reflection , to admit of recapitulation in remarks of this length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that Professor Pigou has to say is that to keep the national dividead undiminished is the only sure means of safeguarding individual welfare . His chapters on the distribution of the national dividend , in which he discusses at some length attempts to improve the distribution by the deliberate transference of resources from relatively rich to relatively poor persons , reflect powers of analysis of the highest order . We are reminded that the advantage to the real income of the poor , which an act of transference brings about immediately , can only prove an advantage on the whole , if the act does not involve an injury to the magnitude of the national dividend The consequences of artificial and differential wage-rates are here explained , as are also those of direct attempts at transference by philanthropists or the state on behalf of the le-Ss fortunate classes The reader need not be told that a discussion of such points as these strikes at the very heart of the most important practical problems of the present day . There are many theorists who would like to diminish the portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the poorer classes . Professor Pigou does not afford these much encouragement in connection with artificial and differential - Wage rates He does say , however , that there is little doubt that plans could be devised which would enable transference from rich to poor to be made with results advantageous to production . This end could be attained through Government establishment of a national minimum of conditions , below which the fortunes of any citizen are not allowed to fall . Economic welfare , he says , is best promoted by the establishment of a national minimum at.such a level that the direct good resulting from the marginal transference to the poor just balances the indirect evil brought about by the consequent reduction of the dividend . This is admirable , but is it certain that the human mind could be found which could strike this balance ? If not , what would happen ? A. History of Continental cedure , with Special France . By A. Esmein . John Simpson Boston &; Co $450 net This is the fifth volume in the Continental Legal History series , published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although the title-page ascribes the authorship to Professor Esmein , several chapters are taken from the writings of Professors Gar-rand and Mittermaier These have been woven together very deftly , and the book is interesting and instructive No American lawyer can read it without learning many things . He may be surprised , at times , as when he reads onpage 595 . " The criminal procedure is less formal in the United States than in England Technical errors in procedure are immaterial , unless they impair the material rights of the defence " Such statements will make him wonder whether the author is mistaken , or whether our American agitators for reform in criminal procedure have been too much disturbed In the four prefaces and introductions to this volume , the American reader is congratulated upon the opportunity here afforded to gain wisdom from the experience of continental nations It is suggested that " America could benefit by imitating to some extent the mixed type of criminal procedure now in use on the Continent of Europe " , and the assertion is made that " criminal procedure in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Great Britain and Continental Europe . " A careful perusal of the volume has led us to a different conclusion . In our opinion , it warrants the , American citizen in congratulating himself that he is not subject to the criminal law of France or Germany . Undoubtedly , he can learn much from the experience of the French , under their various systems of criminal procedure , but it will be chiefly by way of warning . This appears to be the view of Professor Es-mein , as well as of such statesmen as M Briand and M. Ribot They believe in the public accusatory methods of the English procedure , which are our methods also One of the best historical sketches of the English jury system ( which we have inherited ) is found in this volume , as well as one of the strongest arguments for the retention of that system Professor Esmein has unstinted praise for the members of the State 's Council , who braved the opposition of Napoleon and gained the victory for jury trials , in criminal cases , while he laments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harsh methods of the old inquisitorial system His belief in the value of the jury for criminal trials is unshakable : The jury is one of the institutions , the happy product of history in a particularly favorable environment , which is found to answer the crying needs of civilized humanity Born among the English , adopted . by the French Revolution , it is being propagated gradually along with modern civilization , like the constitutional government and the civil State . A great civilized nation can not renounce it without losing its rank It is , it may be said , one of those conquests which , once achieved , are final . Professor Esmein deprecates the present French rule which forbids a summing up by the presiding judge ; and prefers the English practice , under which the judge " directs the jury as to the-rules according to which their verdict must be rendered , " and uses " his authority to make the jury feel the weight and import of the evidence .

Masterpieces of German Literature Translated into English . Vols . I , II , and III Edited by Kuno Francke and William Guild Howard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still largely an unexplored field to those unfamiliar with the language , and to give English readers a survey of the classic writers through good translations is certainly a commendable plan . It must be said that the publishers of the work before us have , to judge from the first three volumes , missed a rare opportunity , though it is fair to add that the real work of the editors , whose names appear on the title-page , promises to become more apparent in the subsequent volumes . The intrinsic importance of what has so far been done scarcely justifies the elaborate apparatus of editors , especial writers , translators , and consulting boards of foreign authorities , that has been set in motion for this enterprise . We find in the three volumes translations , all well known , of several of the dramatic masterpieces of Goethe and Schiller , together with renderings , also old for the most part , of some of their poems and of various prose writings . Thus , we have of Goethe the " Iphigenia in Tauris , " the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dedication , " the " Prologue on the Stage , " and the " Prologue in Heaven " ) , the " Elective Af &nities,"; and an extract from " Wilhelm Meister 's Travels " ; while of Schiller there is " The Death of Wallenstein " and " William Tell . " Twenty-six poems by Goethe and fifteen by Schiller appear in the collection . Opinions will differ as to the selections made . Of Goethe we have neither " Der Gott und die Bajadere , " nor " Die Braut von Korinth , " nor " Der Zauberlehrling . " The editors have done wisely in availing themselves of Anna Swanwick 's translations of the " Iphigenia " and of " Faust , " and of Ellen Frothingham 's admirable rendering of " Hermann und Dorothea " ; but there certainly was no need of including Lord Lytton 's wooden version of " Der Graf von Habsburg . " Of fresh translations there is little in these volumes , and that none of the best , unless we except Charles Wharton Stork 's spirited rendering of , Goethe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry fares better than prose at the hands of the translators , though Miss Julia Franklin 's version of Goethe 's " Shakespeare und kein Ende " deserves a word of praise ; Professor Coleman 's verse is far more idiomatic than Dr. Louis H. Gray 's translation of Goethe 's " Letters to Wilhelm von Humboldt and his Wife . " The opening sentence of the first letter reads : How many an hour have I thought of You with genuine and lively interest ; and nearly every time I have marvelled at the outrageous intention which correspondents can express , that when far apart they will write to each other once a month . Such handling of Goethe 's prose is unfortunately only too common with English translators . It is the irony of fate that halting phrases should be put into the mouth of the great German to whom the world owes the classic translation of Benvenuto Cellini 's " Autobiography , " of Diderot 's " Le Neveu de Monsieur Rameau , " of Manzoni 's ode to " The Fifth of May , " and Voltaire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how full of charm are his versions of the letters addressed to him by Carlyle and Walter Scott , and how sound his advice to translatorsl The editors have prefixed to the first volume a General Introduction by the eminent critic , Prof. Richard M. Meyer , of the University of Berlin . In itself this is a valuable piece of writing , though by no means an exhaustive survey of the subject , and we fear it will not be found easily comprehensible by English readers unacquainted with the main currents of German literature . At all events , as here presented , what Professor Meyer has to say falls strangely on English ears . It may safely be said that no English or American writer on the subject would have expressed himself as Professor Meyer does . The following passage will make our meaning clear : On the whole , however , German lyric poetry is rather made up of simple formations in the style of the folk-song , especially since the important rhythmic transformation of this material by Heine created new possibilities for accommodating the inner form to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two great simplifying factors have , since Goethe , been predominant in protecting our lyric poetry from unfruitful artificiality ; the influence of the folk-song and the connection with music have kept it more full of vital energy than the too literary lyric poetry of the French , and richer in variety than the too cultivated lyric of the English . Whoever shut the door on the influences spoken of , as did Franz Grillparzer or Hebbel , and , in a different way , Annette von Droste-Hiilshoff or Heinrich Leuthold , at the same time nullified a good part of his efficiency . This is difficult reading , though probably a literal translation ; what the English reader finds cloudy , the German accepts unhesitatingly in the original . The volumes contain valuable articles ' on Goethe and Schiller , by Prof. Calvin Thomas , and there are various other scholarly and readable critical notices .
