txt The 2 Per Cent . Government Bonds . In your editorial article on " The Approaching Bond Issue " you make an excellent argument against extending to the 3 per cent . bonds the Government proposes to issue the circulation privilege now enjoyed by the 2 per cents. , which , as the President recently said , the National banks were obliged to take in 1000 because the Government got them into a corner . But if the Government did the banks a wrong in 1000 by inducing them to take these 2 per cent . bonds at a rate far below the normal investment rate , this wrong ought to , be righted by legislation . And a simple way to do this would be to provide by law that when the present 2 per cents . are not used for circulation they shall bear 3 per cent . interest and vice versa , when the new 3s are used for circulation they shall bear 2 per cent . This would put both the old and the new issues on a. parity for both purposes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elasticity to the inflexibleness of our bank currency , which the Government proposes further to inflate by the use of the new 3 per cent . bonds .
