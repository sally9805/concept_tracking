The Folio American State Papers ( Foreign Affairs ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an index to the annual diplomatic cOrrespondence , which begins in 1861 , has been published . The period between these dates , however , has been without such guide The first step towards filling the gap is taken by the publication of Part I , A to H , of an index to our documents relating to foreign affairs from 1828 to 1861 . This section is a huge volume of nearly 800 pages by Adelaide R Hasse , chief of the public documents division of the New York Public Library . It is published by the Carnegie Institution of Washington The thoroughness of the planthat has been adopted for the Index is indicated by the statement that , in addition to the entry of every paper and also of its writer , every subject handled in this mass of material is listed , even when this means several entries for a single paper . The entire collection of items is arranged in one alphabet , in the manner of the ordinary library catalogue , but the arrangement of individual entries under any head is , as one would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need , of such an index may be judged from the fact that the entries under a topic of so recent and important discussion as " Clayton-Bulwer Treaty " fill more than eight columns . " The Woman 's Who 's Who of America " ( American Commonwealth Company ; $5 net ) is a compilation full of surprises There is , on the one hand , no name so distinguished that one may be sure of finding it , and , on the other , none so obscure that one may predict its omission . A cursory examination reveals the following absences : Grace Ellery Chan-rung , Mary Antm , Elsie Clews Parsons , Anne Morgan , and Lizette Woodworth Reese ; while at the same time many of those who are enrolled appear to have achieved fame by merely being graduated from a college . For all that , the book is useful , whether regarded as a book of reference in the ordinary sense or as something like a national directory of club and college women . If the report is true that familiar histories are usurping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of methods would be natural . Memoir-making , as a rule , addresses itself pretty frankly either to lovers , of gossip or to lovers of romance . The chronicler in this kind who does not leer is prone to ogle . The writer of " Old Court . afe in Spain " ( Putnam ; $2 50 net ) adopts an most voluptuously romantic style What she has to write about is not really " court life " in the common and alluring sense She has simply taken the most striking figures and incidents out of old Spanish history , and dressed them in fustian . Her style is the sentimental-exclamatory : " How great is Spain ' How mighty ! " she begins " From the rugged mountains of the Asturias , their base washed by stormy waves , and the giddy heights of the Pyrenean precipices  --  an eternal harrier between rival peoples  --  to the balmy plains of the South , where summer ever reigns , A world within itself , with a world 's variety , " Her anecdotes , which range from the sixth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dialogue  --  such dialogue as would not have shamed Amadis of Gaul or the great Don himself . That , for example , is an eloquent scene between Bernardo del Carpio- and Alonso the Chaste Bernardo is anxious to learn who his parents are : " Great God ! whence am . I sprung ? The very beasts have dams that suckle them , and is Bernardo alone deprived of the common claims of nature ? " No answer came from the king , no sign , no yielding Bernardo 's question had struck him to the quick " As you pray for mercy , sire , speak one word , " urged Bernardo , the trembling of his lips telling what he suffered . " Are father and mother dead ? " " Both to me , " was the stern answer . " The mortal spark of life can never reanimate the soul dead in sin Question me no more , audacious youth . And think not , because my blood runs in your veins that I will favor your ambition . Rather have I called in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . Were I dead , my spirit would stand as with a flaming sword to shut you out . " " Then sweeter far than life and honour and glory come death ! " exclaimed Bernardo , throwing up Ins arms . " From this day I am a desperate man . My sword is to me the staff of life , bloodshed and carnage the food on which I hve ! Come now over the grey heights of the mountains the Frankish host , and I will meet them as never mortal did his country 's foes ! " If there are readers whose souls do not echo to this strain , the book is not for them Richard Curie , the author of " Joseph Conrad : A Study " ( Doubleday , Page ; $1.25 net ) , who has written two volumes of tales and a book about George Meredith is , more zealous than discreet His facts , he says , have Conrad 's authorization ; and a list here set down of Conrad 's ships and the books inspired by them , is said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nevertheless , we suspect that Conrad 's personal connection with the book and its author may have been of the slightest , limited , very likely , to a casual " interview " or so . It is impossible to believe that the author of " The Mirror of the Sea " has deliberately encouraged the critical as- siduities of an admirer so injudicious . To begin with , his facts are very few . If there were anything which readers of Conrad might have been grateful for , it would have been a filling in of that tantalizingly fragmentary outline of the novelist 's life afforded by his two volumes of reiruniscence . Mr. Curie affects to think this a matter of small account He rehearses very briefly the familiar items about Conrad 's life at sea , and dismisses the twenty years that have followed his retirement from the sea with the remark that " from henceforward his life is mainly the history of his books , and does not concern us " In truth , what really interests this commentator is his commentary He has a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the assumption that little or nothing of value has been written about Conrad , and that it remains for himself to reveal a master to the world . Further , he thinks Conrad is comparatively little read , and that most people who read him misunderstand him . " It seems to me , " he laments ( or exults ) , " that the really poetical and thrilling things in Conrad are largely ignored , and that they are ignored because most of the critics are upon the ' wrong tack . ' " Mr. Curie 's proposed office is to set-these false critics right by supplying a true criticism This is a perfectly respectable thing to attempt ; Unluckily the author goes about his work in a manner both bumptious and patronizing . It is one thing for him to put his fellow-critics in their places , and another for him to pat his idol on the back ; we get the impression that he is really trying to boost Conrad ! As for the substance of his criticism , it offers little that is either fresh or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paradoxical manner of the passing hour For the rest , Mr. Curie has an irritating habit of calling attention to the importance of what he is about to say , proceeding to utter something perfectly clear and obvious , and then lamenting that he has probably been talking over the reader 's head : " I know I put my case roughly . Such impressions are often only highly sensitive reactions and as such ,  - -  rte beyond positive proof . A parrot cry easy to lay hold of , but a mental attitude like a will-o ' - the- wisp . " As nearly as we ro-e out from this book , Conrad is an unsuspected genius , a master of English style , a realist , -a romancer , a psychologist , a pessimist , remarkable for his atmosphere , Ins irony , and so on And Curie is his prophet The third volume of Kluchevsky 's " History of Russia , " translated by C. J. Hogarth ( Dutton ; $2 50 net ) , covers the period from the extinction of the old dynasty in 1598 to the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admirable qualities of Kluchevsky 's work have already been commented on in the Nation ( October 2 , 1913 ) . In his treatment of seventeenth-century Russia the topics that will most interest western readers are the development of serfdom , the rise and fall of a primitive sort of Parliament in the Muscovite state , and the gradual penetration of European ideals into that state . Unfortunately , the translation of this volume is no whit better than that of its predecessor . Two quotations from the first chapter will illustrate the extreme caution with which Mr. Hogarth 's version must be used . Of the following sentence it is hard to make even sense : New Europeanised Russia was , for four or five generations , a Russia merely of Guards ' barracks , Government offices , and country houses , the latter leading to the first and the second through an easy course of scions through native schools or exotic pensions , whence she received , in exchange , retired brigadiers in uniform ( p. 8 ) . The original , though clumsy , is at least clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Russia of guards ' barracks , government offices , and country houses of the gentry . the last the country houses guided their young lads to the first and the second the barracks and offices by means of an easy transforming process literally , distillation in native literally , home-grown schools or exotic pensions ; and in place of these young lads they received back from them the barracks and offices retired brigadiers in uniform . In the following passage Mr. Hogarth not only obscures but reverses the sense of the original : But before that accession came about , the Muscovite Empire experienced an upheaval which shook it to its foundations , and gave the first , and a very serious , check to the onward march of the ideas of which the majority of State orders built upon the extinction of dynasties stand most in need ( p. 13 ) . Kluchevsky 's words are as follows : But before that accession came about , the Muscovite Empire experienced a terrible shock , which shook its deepest foundations This also gave a first and a very painful impulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been " absent in the state order built up by the extinct dynasty . The resemblances between the Babylonian and the Hebrew myths and ideas have often been described . What Prof Morris Jastrow proposes in his " Hebrew and Babylonian Traditions " ( Scribner ; $2.50 ) , as he explains in his preface , is to set forth the differences between them This point has not been ignored by other writers , but Jastrow 's treatment is more detailed than is to be found elsewhere . The volume shows admirable mastery of the material , the analyses and interpretations of the Babylonian mythical stories are particularly interesting . Four points are selected for comparison : the story of creation , the Sabbath , the life after death , and the ethical standard . In these , the author holds , though the two peoples began with about the same mass of myths and religious and moral conceptions , the Hebrews finally passed far beyond their neighbors in elevation and religious effectiveness of thought . As the Babylonian national life wan extinguished by the Persian conquest in the sixth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career of the people is a blank except in the elaboration of the astro ? logical-theological astral cult , comparison between them and the Hebrews as to other conceptions can be made properly only in the period ending with the conquest ; we do not know , Professor Jastrow observes , what Babylonia might have accomplished if its national development had not been violently interrupted  --  it was the group of great prophets ( a body unknown in Babylonia ) that established in Israel the conception of a moral government of the world  --  only , Yahweh 's care was confined to Israel , the welfare of other peoples was not considered In the two histories of creation in Genesis we see , says Jastrow , how far the Hebrew view , under the influence of ethical monotheism , diverged from the earlier conception common to the two peoples . In the first chapter of Genesis particularly , the one God , quite divorced from physical phenomena , accomplishes creation , not as an artificer , but by a word  --  he is a spiritual being . As for man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have dominion over the lower animals ; a Babylonian inscription declares that he was created to worship the gods Dr Jastrow thinks the Hebrew the nobler conception ; but the Babylonian may have in mind that the cult of the divine Powers is the most ' important thing in life , and that man 's task is to be its custodian . The remarkable Hebrew development of the Sabbath is clearly brought out by Jastrow . This day , originally a lunar period ( the day of the full moon ) , a time of transition , it is here called , of doubt and danger , when the favor of the gods was to lie sought , was divorced from lunar changes in the later Jewish period and transformed into a season of rational religious devotion  --  an epoch-making step for the organization of public and private religion . The future life had no attraction for the old Semites , Babylonian and Hebrew ; the historical question is when the doctrine of ethical immortality was adopted by the latter ( it is first distinctly stated in the first century B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as some think , in Ps. xlix and Dr. Jastrow regards it as a natural evolution of Jewish thought , helped on by Persian and Greek influences , Finally , as to the ethical development , the ethical codes of Babylonians and Hebrews were virtually identical , the divine Powers favored moral goodness , and the blessings sought were chiefly national and physical ; but in the later Jewish writings we have a more definite sense of sin , desire for moral purity , and the hope of sniritual communion with God . Scattered throughout the volume are illumining expositions of customs and ideas , the whole forming a picture of the pre-Christian Semitic religious life ; note , for example , the discussions of the pessimism of Gen hi and the skepticism of Job and Ecclesiastes The ethical idea finally reached by the Jews , says Jastrow , was perfection of character as the end of existence . As a manual for college use " A History of Philosophy , " by Frank Thilly , professor in Cornell University ( Holt ; $2.50 ) , possesses two important advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more encyclopiedic as a whole and more systematic and complete in its exposition of individual philosophical theories . But it suffers from the defects inevitable to so comprehensive a plan in that the treatment of many minor writers is too summary to be very illuminating , while the greater philosophers , notably Plato and Aristotle , hardly receive adequate interpretation . There are some defects , also , that are not inevitable . As a piece of exposition , the book is no more than a good example of mechanical work . Although the writer intends to consider the thinker as well as his times , his point-by-point analysis hardly takes account of the personal motives and conflict of motives , such as the conflict of considerations presented by the complex relations of form and matter to Aristotle and by Berkeley 's subjective and objective idealism , which give unity to the very contradictions of a philosophical system and make it personally intelligible And the style is rather colorless and loose . Thus " the scholars of the church found in this basal conception realism a splendid buttress upon which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Only a pragmatist could say ( 365 ) that Puffendorf " introduced natural law into Germany . " It is a little disturbing to find Socrates replying to a quotation from Ovid , and prosaically false to think of Plato 's Eros as the " love of truth . " There is a notable rise in vigor both of style and of thought at the Point where , as a conclusion to the " History . " the author appends his admirable address before the Philosophical Association in defence of rationalism . For the moment our interest in American achievements on the Isthmus is almost entirely overshadowed by our concern in matters transatlantic . It is doubtful whether many readers will care to find the time to read " Panama and the Canal : the Story of Its Achievement , Its Problems , and Its Prospects , " by Willis J. Abbot ( Dodd , Mead ; $2 net ) . We have already had a number of books on Panama , and there appears to be no particular excuse for this one . Apparently every author who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write and make words It is easy to get quantities of good pictures , and after watching the laborers " make the dirt fly " and being courteously treated by Col Goethals 's polite assistants , there are few more agreeable tasks than to sit down and tell about it . It must be said in fairness that the present volume is very comprehensive and omits little which the curious reader desires to know of a voyage to Panama and what may be seen after one arrives . It is gossipy and readable , but hardly worth reading . " Big Business " a few years ago preferred to keep as much as possible in the dark Its ways were devious , and it had no desire to court public opinion Evidently recent events have changed all that , for here is the first volume of a series entitled The Romance of Big Business . It is called " Conquest of the Tropics : The Story of the Creative Enterprises Conducted by the United Fruit Company , " and was written by Frederick Upham Adams ( Doubleday , Page ; $2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been known to fame as the author of " The Kidnapped Millionaires " and " The Bottom of the Well , " should have been selected as the apologist of the United Fruit Company , is a little difficult to see , although there may be a subtle connection here . Perhaps it was felt that a romanticist would do more justice to this colossal and well-managed enterprise than a more sober historical writer . It must have been rather hard on the novelist to have to close his book with a categorical interview with the President of the Company , but Mr. Adams 's account of the President 's " frank answers to nay rather pointed questions " is a little bit too disingenuous . The volume is well illustrated , and ought to be widely distributed by the United Fruit Company . The most interesting part of the book is the romantic rise of Minor C. Keith , that pioneer of so many broad-minded and successful efforts to develop Central America                   @ @
