txt Park Music Appreciated . I feel obliged to write a word of praise for the very nice music rendered by a band every Saturday evening for two hours in St. Nicholas Park at 149th Street . All of the pieces rendered are classical or patriotic , and from the applause of those sitting and standing around the park and sitting at windows of the homes within a radius of two or three blocks it seems to be generally appreciated . I can sit in my window and hear it very plainly without the exertion of dressing even for the street and having to stand for the two hours . I wonder if the people generally appreciate how much is done in this great city of ours for their comfort and pleasure , without any direct cost whatsoever to them ? I , for one , am duly appreciative , and this letter will voice the sentiments of many , I am sure .
