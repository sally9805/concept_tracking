THE state of motherhood represents the strongest contrasts in human society . From the joy of the madonna to the bitterness of the wearer of the scarlet letter , the distance is almost infinite . In one the pain of the body is swallowed up by the glory of new life ; in the other , physical pain is weighed down by mental torture and blush of shame . The constant challenge is being thrown to the American people to lessen pain and suffering , and in many ways it finds a quick response ; but the greatest interest is aroused only over those reforms that do not far invade the sphere of human , selfishness . We are enthusiastic in reforming conditions that do not affect us , and that , if removed , leave us untrammelled in the routine of our daily lives : for example , it is not difficult to extend the juvenile court to new sections and communities , but it is difficult to pass laws restraining the exploitation of working children . The selfishness that is exhibited by our pockets frequently finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last thirty-six months attempts have been made to abolish the so-called vice districts in many of our large cities , but everywhere there has been sturdy opposition . Nor has this opposition always sought honestly to curtail the spread of vice , for it is more than a suspicion that many men have been haunted by the possible loss of opportunity for carrying on the habits of degraded vice . Perhaps no other social condition reflects the persistence of men to prevent the advent of an ideal plan of solution so much as does the status of the unmarried mothers . It is the current belief that in the United States the number of unmarried mothers and illegitimate children is comparatively small , and there have been sound reasons for this conclusion ; but a study of the subject in order to ascertain the magnitude of the problem and its many ramifications and intricacies has been given but little attention . That an evil once of minor importance , might , with the changing years and with the multiplex forms of twentieth century life , develop into a constantly increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the average age when women marry has risen about four years , while the status of women in industry , recreation , amusement , social life and the rights and opportunities of women have been revolutionized . The woman 's movement has gained its impetus within this time and men , instead of condemning it , now tolerate its purpose and frequently approve . In Europe statistics on illegitimacy have been gathered for many years , but until recently they have not been put to practical use . In the United States , apart from the regularly recurring decennial census , no systematic vital statistics were gathered until about 1850 . Several eastern States then provided for annual birth and death records , but the published reports consisted largely of figures , without much attempt at analysis . Interest in information gradually developed and some men , no doubt , were impressed with its practical value . In Massachusetts the first figures relating to illegitimacy date from 1854 , and it is no accident that in 1858 the State Medical Society of Connecticut requested the State Librarian , who prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scope of his work and to include in his tabulation facts relating to still births , illegitimacy , plural births , nativity of parents and colored population . Although some of these facts were wanted because of their interest to the physician , others were desired because of their sociological import . The physicians whose social outlook prompted them to make this request were heard , and the statistics for the year 1858 contain information relating to illegitimate births . How nearly complete the figures were can not be now ascertained , but it is interesting to know that one out of every 127 births was reported as illegitimate . Although the Massachusetts statistics on illegitimacy are no longer published , the Connecticut records have been continued up to the present time , and these afford the only series of American statistics on illegitimacy that cover a period of fifty years or more . Michigan , whose vital statistics have been so helpful to the student and the sociologist , differentiated illegitimate births in its first annual report on births and deaths , issued for the year 1868 . It reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six-tenths of one per cent . of all the births . Within ten years , several other States have begun to measure the volume of illegitimacy among their population , and occasional cities are likewise making the needed classification . The results obtained by the different States are indicated in the following table : We do not vouch for the general accuracy of these figures ; we merely present the computations that have been made . The recorded rates for Connecticut have fluctuated somewhat and have risen slightly ; Michigan has more than doubled its original rate ; the remaining States have not gathered facts a sufficient length of time to measure the trend . Interesting and perhaps significant is the difference between Ohio and Connecticut , the rate of the former State being almost twice that of the latter ; and yet the highest proportion given is less than two per cent. , while the lowest figure for any European country is 2.6 per cent . ? the rate in Ireland . Nevertheless , we can not soothe our feelings with such comparisons , since illegitimacy abroad is not quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem of our unmarried mothers proves how weak and imbecile has been our work so far . American problems are not spread out over the country with an equal degree of thickness . If they were , our people would more easily arrive at conclusions . Problems are partly localized ; for example , labor difficulties are confined to industrial sections , congestion is a city phenomenon , and the chief lack of amusement facilities is in the country . Likewise illegitimacy tends to concentrate its evil effects , even though its causes were relatively uniform through our land . This conclusion is indicated by the figures that appear in connection with the following list of cities :  | At first glance it appears that the rates of illegitimacy in metropolitan centres are from 5o to roo per cent . higher than in the various States . The city seems to be a spot where vice incubates and sin walks unashamed , but a microscopic view of the facts does not reveal these conditions . The negro must be treated separately . A few short years of political freedom preceded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ! How can we expect moral conditions equal to those among the whites ? In Washington with its hundred thousand negroes every fifth baby is born out of lawful wedlock , and in St. Louis , where nearly 900 babies arrive every year , 15 per cent . are not legitimate . But in Caucasian Vienna , 30 per cent . of the babies are reported as illegitimate and in Paris , 25 . Although few negro women migrate to distant communities to be confined , among the whites the practice is most common . Country girls go to the large cities , a few to attempt to procure abortion , the larger proportion to find a maternity hospital , and daughters of the well-to-do city dweller often escape to other towns or cities , but the preponderance of traffic is city-ward . An analysis by the writer of the illegitimate white births in St. Louis during the years 1911-13 inclusive , yielded the astounding fact that at least one-half of the mothers were non-residents of the city . Of the births among resident white women , two per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly over four per cent . Here we have a city of refuge to which fly more than 250 women every year , and they come from distant towns and cities as well as from the neighboring sections . That much of the recorded illegitimacy in other cities is due to the influx of women from the outside necessarily follows . Probably the pro  | portions are not so high as those in St. Louis , because of the convenient location of the city for this species of human gravitation . Nevertheless , we must not assume that the vice and irregularity of a city are measured by the illegitimate births within that city chargeable against its residents . The number who temporarily leave the city is unknown , as well as the frequency of another vice , in fact a crime , abortion . Unlawful motherhood may be a badge of comparative virtue . Far more vicious and degraded is the woman who flings her challenge to motherhood and then turns to the physician for an escape from the consequences that she has incurred , but her history is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does the devotee of virtue pass her by with his eyes protected with moral blinkers as he does the nobler woman who refused to commit cwo wrongs in an effort to right herself . Facts about mothers must be considered in the light of responsibility of fathers , since the solution of the problem depends largely on the success of efforts to make fathers realize that their sins will prove costly to them . Heretofore , the burden has been borne by mothers . Hereafter , fathers must be brought to terms . The age of unmarried mothers throws light on this necessity . Is she that wan-faced hopeless girl just melting into womanhood , or has she reached the full amplitude of her mental powers ? Has she been ignorant of the meaning of her life , or is she fully resolved to undergo any risks that may pertain to habits of immorality ? Some significant conclusions are apparent in the following summary of figures for two American cities and for the Grand Duchy of Baden , Germany : There is a striking similarity between the figures for St. Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent . of the girls have not reached 16 and more than one-fifth of the total  | number are under 18 . More than one-half of the girls and women fall before they reach the age of 21 . If we consider the few years in which this large volume of illegitimacy must express itself , we can not but be impressed with the heavy rates that prevail in these early years of life . Before the age of 21 there are at most but six years of opportunity for vice ; but beyond this time lie 20 to 25 years of lifetime available for misuse with consequences terminating in unlawful motherhood . The greatest temptations confront the American girl when she has reached her , eighteenth birthday . Not yet ready to marry , she nevertheless toys with the other sex and only too frequently yields her body to the tempter . Her physical beauty has reached its choicest blossom , but her mind and morals are often powerless to counteract the seductiveness of beauty . The girl of 19 comes next , and she too is caught in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One-half of the illegitimate births occur among girls from 17 to 21 years of age , but occasional tragedies are revealed among girls who are mere children in age and of still more tender years in mind . A little negro girl of 12 , without the semblance of a home , wandering to and fro , falls into the trap of the seducer ? a child-mother , grim with the desperation of worthless living . A white girl , only 13 , born in Russia , after coming to America loses her moral balance and her grip on virtue , and the birth certificates are required to omit the name of the father of her child . And so on , beginning with the " teens " and ending in the forties . The figures for Baden are interesting because of the contrast which they afford . And while the volume of illegitimacy is greater than in the United States the age distribution also is decidedly unlike ; here we find almost no girls under the age of 16 , while the percentage under i8 is less than four , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 . Furthermore , the age of greatest frequency is not 18 , when the mind is still so immature , but 21 , when greater mental stability has been acquired . Apparently the general incidence of illegitimacy in Baden is from two to three years later than in the two American cities quoted . The immature girl is relatively safe , while unlawful motherhood is embraced chiefly by women who have passed the highest age of consent established in any American State . Al- though the causes for these differences can not be easily determined , the fact of their existence is a challenge to further study ; for a first step in our American programme of preventing illegiti macy consists in the protection of every girl who is under 18 years of age . Folly breeds folly and vice begets vice , but the disaster that accompanies illegitimacy would seem to crush all incentive to its repetition , and yet this is not the case . Lost virtue may indeed cease to struggle , but the social humiliation and the economic hardships that follow ? these are the influences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1913 , 25 girls , ro of whom were white , each gave birth to a second illegitimate child before reach ing the age of 21 . Several of these had not arrived at their seventeenth birthday . One domestic 20 years of age was three times a mother , and an actress of equal age had a still-born baby which represented her third confinement . Among older women the repetition of immorality is still more common , due no doubt , in part , to the hopelessness of struggling against the dis favor which they encounter everywhere . Finally , they abandon themselves to the life they so unwittingly entered . Occasionally entire families of illegitimate children are discovered . Next to the age of mothers , the condition of most absorbing interest is their occupation . No American figures have ever been published in answer to this question , and as the facts herein given pertain to a single city no generalizations are warranted . However , they will serve as an indicator and a guide . In the three years , out of 2,095 illegitimate births 6o per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household servants . Three-fifths of the entire number of mothers were engaged in one branch of industry , but throughout the United States this branch employs less than 15 per cent . of all the working women . Apparently it yields more than its due proportion of the cases , making allowance for any abnormal conditions that may exist in any one section of the country . This condition holds true in Chicago , where the Judge of the Court of Domestic Relations discovered that 51 per cent . of the women involved in the bastardy cases handled in 1913 were domestic servants . At once , two questions of grave import arise to trouble the seeker of knowledge and  | the sociologist . Is domestic service a morally extra-hazardous occupation ? Is the class of women employed in this branch of industry mentally and morally inferior ? Answers to these ques tions must be left in abeyance for the present , although a number of relevant observations can be made . The domestic servant has no natural protector and her opportunities for social life are seriously handicapped . Usually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of low morals is almost unavoidable . The domestic working in the home is of all working girls most nearly without a home . The social position of the domestic in the country and small towns is , however , much more favorable than in the cities . That labor does not flow freely from manufacturing and mercantile occupations into domestic service is well known and suggests the probability that the mental types are somewhat different . Federal statistics show a prepon derance of domestics among working girls appearing before the juvenile court . These facts , however , do not necessarily indicate moral inferiority , as the effects may have been due largely to the conditions under which the domestics have been compelled to live . On the whole , low standards of morals are not proved and a heavy burden seems to rest on the environment of the domestic servant . Although the factory workers rank second , they constitute not more than one-fourteenth of the entire group . In view of the masses of women that have entered the manufacturing in industry , so small a proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saleswomen or store girls . Counting every girl who might possibly qualify under this group of workers , we find not more than three per cent . Since so large a propor tion of all are domestics , the percentage engaged in other occu pations must necessarily be small , but the laundress , the seamstress , the milliner and the waitress are very much in evidence , and no doubt exceed their proportion of the cases . Skilled trades and professions are but feebly represented . Several bookkeepers and stenographers are included , as well as a few nurses , actresses and musicians . Indicative of the obloquy that is attached to unlawful motherhood and of the need of seeking some place of refuge is the record of the teachers , who represented over one  | per cent . of the total number . Nearly all of these have come from some small town or village where their ruin was apparently consummated . Likewise , most of the students and school-girls recorded were brought to the city temporarily for purposes of confinement . The higher the social station , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere ; among the very poor , removal from home is not only impossible , but the motive is less . Seven-tenths of the entire number , regardless of pre vious residence , patronized the institutions and maternity homes with which the city is supplied . It is because of this fact that a heavy cost is entailed upon the city . The number of marriages that have been consummated is almost negligible , and the support given by putative fathers is notoriously small . Almost the entire burden , therefore , has fallen upon the unfortunate girls , their relatives , and philanthropy . The immediate interest of the public depends on the cost of its philanthropy , but the ultimate interest must be based on the need of perfecting our standards of morality and of lifting human beings to higher levels . These few facts are only a beginning , but facts are the neces sary basis for a programme of reform . Yet knowledge , although it may be power , is not momentum . It is really nothing more than potential energy , and unless a people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . European statistics have portrayed knowledge for decades , but the genuine attack on illegitimacy was not begun until within the last decade . Since then , Germany and Scandinavia have begun to strive for fundamental measures of prevention . American States have done but little , yet a progressive law here and another there shows we are slowly awakening to the need . But unlawful motherhood furnishes its own retribution , while unlawful fatherhood escapes , only to continue its work of demoralization . No programme of attack is complete unless it demands that the father bear his share of the burden . Legislation is not pro gressive unless it strikes this keynote . Make illegitimacy costly and burdensome , and it will decline . It is not a woman 's problem , nor is it a man 's problem , but it is a question of human beings with sex impulses , and unless the aggressive sex is restrained , we can not hope to root out the evil .  |                  @ @ @
