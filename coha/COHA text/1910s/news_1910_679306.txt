txt Mr. CARNEGIEL was not more famous for his young partners than is Mr. Monoerz . Only the other day he commandeered the services of Mr. DAVISON , and now he loses the services of Mr : G. W. I oxuis , who aspires to new usefulness in a field of more than personal interest . Mr. ** as is well known , has always been interested in theoretical as well as practical finance , and in the interest of the workingmen as well as that of their employers . He has lectured on these subjects at more than one university , and he has devised the largest as well as the most successful of all profit-sharing schemes . On the side of the corporation he has committed himself to regulation by the Government , and to the anticipation of Government regulations by doing voluntarily all that can reasonably be asked by Government . Regulation has no terrors for corporations like the one whose policy has been largely 4guided by its former Chairman . of finance . And if the Steel Corporation has had a minimum of labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same spirit that it has dealt with the GovernmentWithin a day or two a pension system for superannuated employes has been announced and a profit-sharing system of interesting the employes in the welfare of the Corporation has long been operative . This record is interesting in connection with the statement that the author of these and other similar plans designs to give his new leisure to the promotion of better feeling between labor and capital . It will be admitted that this ambition is laudable , and adequate to employ any capacity any man possesses . The exacting employer and the unreasonable employe have between them rather entangled than settled their relations . It will be interesting to see what may follow the efforts of a practical man , with a record of competency and sympathy on both sides . With experience- in each camp , and a thorough detachment resulting from his retirement , it may be hoped that Mr. PEREINS will do some good in ; his new field , even though he may not reach an ultimate solution of problems as old as the world , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , let us say , as human ' nature in the world .
