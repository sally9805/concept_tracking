txt If the Navy Departs Yesterday 's ment , it seems , ' can get Ships the consent of Con= gress , it will be glad for Targets . to sell all of our warships that are out of date , according to the standard of efficiency among firstclass nations , to countries like Turkey , that can not afford ? to have the ' best of vessels and must be content with those which have been " marked down " as not of this season 's style or slightly damaged . That seems to be a sufficiently businesslike plan , and though to carry it out might excite criticism as In some ways incompatible with our proclaimed love of universal peace and our determination to get it , Congress would n't be apt to mind a little thing like that . But the department will hang on to Its second and third best ships unless it can be clearly understood that the money ' they bring is to be added to , not form a part of , the regular appropriations for new construction and the Increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displease the Congressional mind  --  for reasons not all bad . To permit it would almost certainly lead to the condemnation by enthusiastic naval men of ships before even their present short lease of life had ' expired . There would be no economy in that , except as economy Is viewed by those who see it nowhere except in the potential and somewhat problematical savings involved in having bigger and better ships than anybody else . If we do not sell our old ships , the only profitable way to get rid of them , apparently , is to use them for targets . The canvas screens so much shot at are unsatisfactory in that they tell nothing except as to accuracy of marksmanship . Firing ' at armor plate set up on shore does n't tell what the navy really wants to know about the power of its guns , since reduced charges are used and the angle of the hits can not be conveniently varied . Even real ships for targets do not quite content the professionals when they are so far out of date as to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Scientific American , In discussing this subject , goes so far  --  whether In jest or earnest ? as to say that only a truly modern warship , embodying all the latest improvements and of the largest size , would be an ideal subject for target nraetice . It does n't suggest that this ideal target should he fully manned when bombarded , but obviously that would be the WaV actually to duplicate the conditions of real war  --  and to reduce the whole argument jo highly desirable absurdity . Acceptance of fees by Clerical clergymen for performing Fees marriage , burial , and . Tipschristening services was and warmly defended by a Correspondent whose letter we printed yesterday . Perhaps his defense was a little more warm than successful . He made out something of a case , indeed , for the taking of fees from persons not members of the clergyman 's own congregation  --  persons who contribute nothing for his support in the regular way , and who want of him nothing except the exercise In their behalf of his ministerial and official powers on these infrequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these extra-congregational people is reasonable , nobody would assert that to take it lowers ciprical dignity , or would deny . for that matter , the propriety of insistence on getting it . But  --  a fee is one thing and a tip is another , and quite different . If the clergy had , and where the clergy have , a fixed schedule of charges for these services , there could be and is no complaint or criticism , except of course as to the amount of the charges , If more than some can afford to pay . When the size of the clergyman 's fee , ' however , is " whatever the gentleman pleases , " exactly as is the waiter 's or the barber 's , he should not be surprised if it be called by the same name or if it become a subject of derision by light minds and of occasional grieved reproach by those serious and reverent . Our correspondent said that ministers turned their fees over to their wives , and also that most ministerial salaries are so low that to cease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These are undeniable statements , but they are not obviously relevant to the discussion . Probably the best defense that can be made of the custom is insistence on the fact that it is a custom  --  one long established and widespread , as well as one that has been followed , whether with submission or approval , few know , by Innumerable good men , at least as regardful of dignity anti the essential proprieties as are they who call these fees " tips " and unseemly . That does n't quite prove that the custom ever was , is , or ever will be right or wise , but a large probability in its favor can thus be raised . It is hardly necessary to consider our correspondent 's effort to establish an analogy between the fees of clergymen and those of doctors and lawyers . The doctors and lawyers do not take " whatever the gentleman pleases , " nor do they do nothing and try to look pleasant when the gentleman pleases to keep his money in his pocket . United States District The Problem Attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s kCler to his facts when he Bank said that the bank employes who testified against MORSE have not since been able to get positions in other banks . Whether or not he was also right in his deductions from these facts and the implications he based on them remains , unfortunately , a matter of some doubt . The bankers , after showing some inclination to deny that the facts were as stated , afterward contented themselves with denying the deductions and implications . Not one of them , so far as we have noticed , explains the non-employment of these men as due to their demonstrated inability to resist temptation or " pressure " to take part In wrongdoing and their willingness to remain where it is going on . That would have been perfectly and easily tenable ground , and why it wasanit taken it is hard to understand . The matter as It stands is an unpleasant one , and it will not be settled until it has been settled right ? by a clear exposition of the whole truth , that is.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
