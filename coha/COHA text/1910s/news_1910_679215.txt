Har- ' mon , came to earth just before 5 o'clock to-night , roughly twenty-five hours after his start and just about twenty-two miles . from Chicago . He had made three attempts at flight to . reach this point near East Chicago , Incl. , and the entire period since his start yesterday had been a. chapter of accidents .

" said Ely , in response to.a question over the longdistance telephone from a TreiEs reporter who had been waiting for him on THE 144 NEW Yon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What am I going to do ? Why , I 'm going through . of course , and I 'm go , ing to win that prize . I 've got the time yet with an even break of luck , and I , think that must be coming to me to make up for the bad luck I 've had so far . " - The Day 's First Accident . Ely 's first accident to-day Occurred just an instant or two after he arose- . from Beverly Hills , where he had drooped the night before . The evening hours and , . those of this early morning were devoted to repairing the engine and the front wheel of the biplane 's chassis , which had been broken yesterday when Ely made his second attempt to rise . He was to - have started at 7:30 o'clock this morning . but spent some time in testing out his engine , and it was not until 8:23 that he actually rose from the ground easily to the accompaniment of the plaudits of a crowd of several hundred , among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile when his engine , which had missed yesterday because of the clogging of the needle pin in his carburetor , began to miss again  --  this time because the feed pipe con-netting the gasoline tank with the carburetor had broken loose from Its fastenings . " It must have been shaken loose by the rough ground over which I had to travel before I could mount into the air , " explained Ely later . Whatever caused the accident it made prompt descent imperative . Ely picked a spot for landing in a field ahead and succeeded in getting over this field with his i rapidly wasting power , only to find that a deep ditch lay directly in the path  - -  which his biplane must take . With even one last ounce of power he might have escaped it , but his engine was dead . There was nothing to move the biplane , and he was compelled to let it fall to the ground as gently as he could . It struck the turf and rolled forward toward the ditch , Ely jamming on the brakes which retard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his craft . however . It shot forward , the front wheel dropped into the ditch , and the craft practically came a cropper . lily was flung from his seat and sent rolling over the ground a dozen feet ahead of Ins machine . The front wheel of the machine was smashed , and as this support gave way the front control plunged nose-on into the turf . There was a rending , tearing noise , and the bamboo and oil-coated silk was ripped and torn . When Ely rose to his feet i was to confront a wrecked aeroplane . Meantime the crowd which had seen the start was rustling to the airman 's aid . When they came up . a man was sent forward to the special train , which was waiting on the main track at Gary . Glenn H. Curtiss , a passenger on the special train , with Mrs. Ely and Ely 's two me- . enames taking sonic spare parts , took an automobile for the scene of the accident . Repairs were completed . : sirs . Ely returned to the train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station heard that the flier was up again and might be expected at any moment . He did not appear , however , and it was 3:45 before anything Was heard from him . Then came the report . The Second Accident . " He 's dropped in East Chicago , " was the flash which the railroad station agent at Gary received . " Fell like a bullet out of the sky . " More messages followed , and at 6 o'clock the telephone bell in the station rang , and it was Ely himself on the wire . " I 'm all right . Tell my wife , " were his first words . " The machine 's smashed , though , and I ca n't get out of here until to-morrow . Don ' t know what 's the matter , but my engine stopped again . " A relief e part started immediately by trolley ear for party unfortunate flier , who had reporied that lie was only five miles from Gary , while the special train tea med back into Chicago . Ely was foetid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between that town and Wniting . His craft was badly stints lied . the front control for the second time in the day having been wrecked and almost torn from the rest of the biplane . Ely was worn looking and tired as well as disgusted with the luck that had pursued him . " Do you know , " he exclainwrl , " I could see Gary from the seat of my biplane Just before 1 was forced to alight . I was getting along nicely , more than 1,1 ) 00 feet in the air , and was just getting ready to look out for the white-painted roof of the special train when my engine began to miss . I tell you I was discouraged , I thought of my ill-luck of y  --  sterthey and of this morning and prayed to myself that presently all the cylinders might h get . working again . I was to have no such luck . however . Instead of improving the engine got worse , and presently I realized , that I would have to come to the ground . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little time to pick Out a landing place , and the result is that I 'm in tins swamp . Once again my landing was bad , this time because of the nature of the soil into which the wheels settled . So once more I found myself : pitched out on my face with the front of my craft a wreck . " I suppose it 'll take me- till to-morrow noon to get the car in shape to go again , but once I do , look out . I 'm going to beat it just as far and as fast as I can . It wo n't be my fault if I do n't make R. fine mileage , and after that if the luck holds I expect to keep up nearly sixty miles an hour right into New York . " Do you know , " he added . " I have a sort of suspicion that perhaps the- gasaline I am using is not Just the right sorts . If it had ( any foreign substance in it or were not pure it would have just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass . do n't know what made her miss this last time , the connections are all right and the carburetor is worklog well . I suppose I 'll learn that tomorrow . Right row I 'm too tired to look ; however I 'M be on the job in the morning . " Ely is spending the night in East Chicago to be near his machine to-morrow morning . Curtiss and his mechanics are with him . Tiv y expect to see the airman well on his way againby noon to-morrow .
