txt Mrs. Helen Jenkins , about whom have whirled millionaires , detectives , customs men , and others in the story brought to light by the discovery of the alleged smuggling of jewels for her to the value of $156,000 , replied yesterday to certain statements made about her by Mrs. William A. Russell , who was living with her at the Hotel Lorraine when the celebrated theft of $300.000 worth of diamonds took place in December , 109 . Among other things Mrs. Russell was quoted as saying that Mrs. Jenkins is an adventuress , and that W. J. Sutherland , Superintendent of the Mooney &; Boland Detective Agency In Chicago , was about I the rooms and corridors of the hotel for a week berore the robbery which he was afterward called in to solve . Mrs. Jenkins was seen at the Wells ! more , Broadway and Seventy-seventh Street , on her return from an automobile ' trip last night , and was asked to tell of her acquaintance with Mrs. Russell and the facts of the theft and return of the I jewels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December , 1909 , " she said , " I was called to the telephone one day by Judge W. S. Foltz of New Castle , Penn. , whom I knew and who is a man of high standing socially and in business . He said he wanted me to meet a friend of his , whom he described as a charming woman , who was with him at the Waldorf . I went I there , and we all had luncheon together . We started for a drl ; e ni my car . Mrs. Russell was chilly , and we stopped at the Lorraine so that I could lend her a fur coat . While she was : n my room she sat on the bed and cried . She said sho had ; left her husband , and that she had used I up all the money she had and would have j to leave the Waldorf . She said she had no means of going elsewhere , and could not return home . I felt very sorry for her , and it ended by my asking her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " She was with me about a month . ; She had been there only a few days when one of her daughters came to see her . I felt so sorry for her that I suggested to the daughter that it be arranged for her to go home . My sole idea was to help bring about a reconciliation with the husband . The daughter did not encourage the idea , saying that it wee . impossible . The next day one of the eons came and then the other son and daughter . All of them began to make their headquarters in my apartment and took many of their meals there , including late suppers . Of course , I paid for all the meals , and I also gave the girls spending money from time to time and bought them simple little gowns when they had social affairs to attend for which they were not prepared . They all agreed it was impossible for Mrs. Russell to return home . " This went on until the time approached when I was expecting Mr. Allen  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  back from Europe . On the Tuesday before the robbery occurred I told Mrs. Russell she would have to go . On the Saturday in question , Dec. 11 , I was going for a drive at 3 o'clock , returning in time for tea at 5 , to which I had invited a number of friends , including Mr. Foltz and Mr. Collins . Mrs. Russell went out on an errand for me and had not returned when I left in my car . She came in soon after and was in the apartment when I returned . The jewelry was gone from the cedar chest in which I kept it with some other things . " I telephoned the manager of the hotel and asked him to notify the police . He declined to do so , and as the next best thing I decided to call up the Pinkerton Detective Agency , I do n't know whether the manager changed his mind or how the police were notified , but a few minutes after the Pinkerton men came Lieut . Braun arrived from Police Headquartei'a . Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioning them about the robbery , including Mrs. Russell , at which I protested . " On Sunday I stayed quietly at home and on Monday morning I drove up to Arrowhead Inn to consult a fortuneteller . You know , we women all believe in them . Lieut . Braun told me afterward that Mrs. Russell telephoned him that I was going there with the missing dia'monds to turn them over to a man . While I was in a room with the fortune-teller he and two plain clothes men burst in . They looked foolish when they saw nobody but us two women in the room . I had trorgbt Mrs. Russell anu she was waiting for me . The police took that opportunity to put us through the third degree , ' Mrs. Russell and myself , and they made vs spend the lest of the day that way . " When we got back in the evening there was a telegram from Mr. Sutherland , offering his services . He had also tried to get toe by telephone from Chicago . I had known Mr. Sutherland it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Allen , but I had not teen hint or heard from him since I had left Chicago several weeks before . He had not been around the place , as Mrs. Russell says . Lieut . Braun had returned with me , and while he was still tta re Mr. Sutherland again called on the telephone from Chicago . He told me not to worry , that the jewels would be recovered , but I must leave it to the Mooney &; Boland Agency and get rid of the PInkertons whom I had called in . He also said there would ' be no expense to me. was embarrassed and subsequently told Mr. Dougherty , the Pinkerton superintendent , just what Mr. Sutherland had kaid . He said it was all right ; that probably Mr. Sutherland would recover the jewelry and the Plnkertons were withdrawn . Mr. Sutherland arrived in New York Wednesday morning and took charge of the investigation . He and Mr. Collins told me Mr. Allen did not intend to see me again , but was willing to make a settlement . Both of them seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diamonds . I told them that if Mr. Allen wanted to leave me it was his privilege to do so , and that I had no claim on him and desired no settlement from ' him . I insisted , however , that I wanted my the way things were going , and engaged Robert C. Morris as my attorney , which displeased Mr. Sutherland and Mr. Collins very much . Mr. Sutherland went back to Chicago , and after a time I got word from him that the diamonds had been recovered and that I should come and Identify them . " I went with Lieut . Braum and my sister . At Englewood , just before we got to Chicago , Mr. Collins boarded the train and told me to get off there . We did so , and a. motor car that was waiting for us took us to Mr. Sutherland 's home . There he and Mr. Collins again talked to me of a settlement . They wanted me to sign a release of Mr. Allen and drop the investigation of the robbery . Finally they took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorney , came there , and we all went to the Mooney &; Boland agency to identify the diamonds . To my surprise they produced a number of loose stones , which I refused to identify without the settings . It was also evident that some of the stones were missing , and Dlr . Sutherland said a man named Koshock had bought them for $4 , Z00 , and we would have to get them back from him . Of course , they were worth much more . In order to do this , Mr. Sutherland said , I would have to employ the firm of attorneys headed by Judge MeEwen , as they were the only ones who could reach Koshcck 's lawyer , a man named Davis , to whom 10 per cent of the value of the stones recovered would have to be paid . This was to he based on an appraisal which Mr. Sutherland said he would have made . " I returned to New York , and a few days later was notified that the jewelry had been recovered . I went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , and so were Mr. Collins , Mr. Morris , and Lieut . Braun . The settings had been recovered and some of the other jewelry from which the stones had not been unmounted . There were fire big stones missing from a necklace , three from a ring , ' and several smaller stones . I was told that the jewelry recovered had been appraised at *120,000 , on which the commission to Davis was to be $12,500 , although I do n't know what the extra $51 ) 0 was for . I was also told that Koshock was to get back the $.4,500 he had paid for some of the stones . I told them not to pay it , but Mr. Sutherland said it had been paid already . " All the expenses were to he deducted from the settlement I was to get from Mr. Allen , they said . The return of the jewels and the settlement were all made part of one transaction . The settlement was $72 , - 000 . I do n't know how they arrived at that sum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the diamonds , giving me about $31,000 . Subsequently Judge came to my house in Eighty-sixth Street and offered me *1,500 more on account of the gems thee had not been recovered , which I accepted . " I simply tell you the facts . I do not cafe to draw any inference as to how the jewels were stolen . " It is true . as Mrs. Russell says , that I was on calling terms with several young girls whose families are prominent in society during the time his wife was staying with ma at the Lorraine . It was I ' who dropped their acquaintance after the robbery and the ' charges and countercharges that were made . I did not wish to embarrass them , and when some of them called afterward I excused myself . " As to Mrs. Russell 's statement that I had two children in Chicago , to whom I wrote letters , the children are my sister 's , and not mine .
