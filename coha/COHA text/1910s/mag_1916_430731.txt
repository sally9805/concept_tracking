 |p614  IN a recent issue The New York Call , which is perhaps the most influential socialist newspaper in the country , prints on its editorial page a two-column article under the " display " heading : " The Riddle of the Socialist Universe . The writer is Mr. Joshua Wanhope , a socialist of marked lucidity , who is , I understand , one of the editors of The Call . The purpose of the article is to show that the socialist movement in the United States , as in Europe , has been forced by events into a position of self-contradiction , from which it must extricate itself at short order , on peril of intellectual bankruptcy and political collapse . This emergency has been precipitated by the " preparedness " movement . The socialist party is a peace party ? absolute . Only a few months ago , by a referendum vote running more than fourteen to one , it amended its constitution to read : " Any member of the socialist party elected to an office who shall in any way vote to appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expelled from the party . " Now , on the other hand , it is orthodox socialist doctrine , as everybody knows , that the capitalistic system as it exists H Europe and America commits the business-world to an international belligerency that necessarily tends toward war . Of course it is to be understood that the hope of socialists everywhere has been that their movement of universal pacification would out-run the belligerency of business , and that socialists would arrive at the high places of power in time to forestall a general military mobilization . So long as socialists were able to entertain such a hope , there seemed to be no necessary contradiction between the two articles of the socialist creed . They could , with a good conscience and without prejudice to patriotism , go on saying in one breath . first , that capitalism makes war , and second , that socialists must not have anything to do with the fighting . But now that hope has been cancelled out in Europe . And in the United States also  |p615  it seems to have departed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since American socialists , like their confreres in Germany , France and England , have no notion of separating their party from their country , they are now brought face to face with a staggering contradiction . How now can they say that capitalism is drawing their country swiftly toward violent collision with foreign states ? and say also that they will do nothing to defend her ? That is an impossible position . When the menace of war stood far off , it was possible to declare that socialism was a sufficient shield to ward away the danger . But now the danger is near . Socialists are driven to confess that the socialist shield is not yet ready , nor will it be soon . It will take much time . And the peril will not wait . Socialists like Mr. Wanhope are brave and honest enough to admit that they are bewildered . Shall they recant their pacific doctrine and turn in to help the country arm , as Mr. Charles Edward Russell advises ? At that price they can purchase the right to say : " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world of the danger of universal shipwreck , and of the need to be prepared . " Shall they on the contrary hold fast to the gospel of peace , renouncing their seemingly proved and seasoned theory of the war-ward drift of modern business ? Or is there some tertium quid , some high Hegelian synthesis that can lift them out of their dilemma ? The case is exigent . There is no time to lose . Mr. Wanhope hangs out his signal of magnanimous distress . There is no unmanly flinching , nor any false shame . He declares that the present position of the socialist party " can not stand the test of reality , " and that if no better position can be found the party will " have to acknowledge a stale-mate , and acknowledge that the Gordian knot can not be cut by us . " Again he says : " Who can formulate a solution . . . that is practicable , a position that can be reasonably and consistently maintained ? He will be the master-mind of . the socialist movement of America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outsider , ineligible to that great award , I venture to offer a few well-considered aids to reflection , which if rightly  |p616  used may have power in them to save what is true and social in socialism . I submit the following propositions : In all countries that derive their ostensible governments from the ballot-box , the modern business system is the predominant force in politics . I mean of course the system based on capital , credit , contract and corporate organization , in and through which nearly everybody nowadays does his day 's work and makes his living . And the point is that the working-order has become much stronger than the voting-order . The sufficient reason why this business-system has not been voted out of existence by socialists , is that it has always been able to identify its interests with the short-run interests of a majority of the voters . In the nature of things this must continue to be the case . There is no prospect that majorities will anywhere , or at any time in the near future , acquire spiritual or economic strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision and valor , the bird in the hand for the two in the bush . The worse the system , the harder it is for the mass of the people to take any sweeping political action against it . The development , within the last two or three generations , of this delicate , powerful and all-comprehensive working-organization has about it a kind of fatality or finality that must be faced . The vain attempt to vote the business-system out of existence ought to be given up . Whatever may be the case under a military autocracy , the fact remains that in democratic countries the existing organization of industry and commerce ? or something like it ? is going to continue for an indefinite period to attach to itself the fortunes of a majority , and is going to control the government . Socialism , so far as it undertakes to overrule the business-system by the massing of votes , is indeed something less than a stale-mate . But it does not follow that the spirit and purpose of socialism ? its insistence upon the socializing of the economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . On the contrary , this spirit or purpose will , I am confident , escape from its  |p617  present bafflement and bewilderment , on the day that socialists quit trying to vote the business-system out . The thing to do is to make terms with reality . Socialists should accept the inexpugnable fact that the fortunes of the majority are bound up in the business system ? and they should undertake to socialize the system . There is really nothing else to do , since the working-organization has so completely conquered and subjugated the voting-organization . Socialists are right in saying that , as it stands , the businesssystem is belligerent and commits the nations to war . They are wrong if they persist in saying that the system can not be reformed and made social , or if they fail to perceive that its present belligerent and unsocial character violates its own constitution . The fact is that the business-system must be regarded as unbusinesslike , unscientific and self-contradictory ? until it ceases to be belligerent and becomes the agency of a community-of-interest , crossing class-lines and political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution , narrows down to this : By what strategy of revival and reform may the socialists hope to restore our belligerent business-system to its " constitution of peace " ? If such a programme can be framed , socialists can go on saying that the actual tendency of the business-system is warward ; but that they are all for peace , and are determined to turn the tendency the other way . Thus socialism can be saved from the maw of the sphinx . And the intellectual integrity of socialists will be vindicated . In considering such a programme , first let it be observed that a working-system accepted by most men as a thing of natural justice , but which does in fact breed war between classes and nations , must have in it some hidden spring of perversity that needs a searching eye to see . The presumption is raised that the system may be all right in its ground-plan , but is not working normally . And that , I submit , will turn out to be the acknowledged fact . The ground-plan of the business-system is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicidal tendency that runs counter to the constitutional principles of industry and trade , as  |p618  understood and approved by honest men . Certainly most people can not see that the system as it stands is framed to harbor privilege . On the contrary , it seems to them to be an admirable scheme for releasing the productive forces of society , and giving to each man place and promotion according to his power to " deliver the goods . " Thus the rectification of the system will simply bring to reality a state of affairs that the mass o casual and unobservant men suppose actually to exist . It will then be discovered that this modern social order of capital , credit , contract and corporations ? compared with the various imperial , parliamentary and feudalistic systems of social coordination and control ? is the only form so far known to history that is absolutely unamenable to privilege . You can put privilege into any of the more ancient forms of social-control without destroying them ; they may last comfortably enough for centuries . But you can not put privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial panics of increasing violence and exhaustion , bitter class-struggles , ferocious foreign wars . The modern business-system , when infected with monopoly , loses its natural shape and poise , and can find no stable footing . In a vain effort to recover its equilibrium it strives forward through misfortune to disaster , and can not rest until it has involved the whole world in unparalleled calamity . The war-ward tendency of business is a violent distemper ? like that of a Texan steer that has eaten the locoweed . The socialists , who were first to discover this tendency , should also have been first to see that the belligerency of the business-system is not constitutional to it ? that it is a disease , a curable disease . Rightly considered , it is a compliment to any human institution that it goes mad when you put privilege into it . So the programme of social recuperation must find the most vital organ of business and propose a regime of health for it Socialists have generally failed to locate this most vital organ because they have thought about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the times . Thus in branding the bad thing as " capitalism " they have wholly missed the  |p619  point . It is not capitalism that is the matter with us . The evil is not in private initiative , private property in tools , or personal and non-official control of great industries . The truth is that the capitalist , as ruler of society , is almost as archaic as the landlord . No longer as the mere owner of land or of tools may one reach the place of highest power . The sovereignty of modern business lies in the control of industry and commerce through the administration of credit . They who have power to give or withhold financial power , in whose hands it is to decide what wheels shall turn and what wheels shall not turn , and who are able to give every man his rating in the market-place ? they are the masters of politics ; and by our default of social sense for the ordering of social processes , they are the rulers of the modern world . These private administrators of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangements . It is in their power , for example , to take the tools away from millionaire tool-owners . And such a thing as the " single tax " need not cause them a qualm , since they alone could pay the rents and dispose of the public revenues . Imagine a state ? say the state of California ? in which landlordism had ceased to exist through the public appropriation of all " economic " rents , in accordance with the Henry George formula . Then imagine the abolishment of all capitalism also , by " act of God , " some greater San Francisco fire and earthquake that had swept away the whole material equipment of productive enterprise throughout the state . Society would then be thrown back upon its immaterial equipment ? upon the complex of creative capabilities , of technical and scientific talents , which is the historical heritage of the people of the state of California . Let it be noted that these " incorporeal hereditaments " ? this immaterial equipment ? is the quintessence of all economic and political power . It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the power to put the immaterial equipment of a people in array ? or in disarray ? is the ultimate definition of social authority . In the case supposed , therefore , the immaterial equipment  |p620  would be sufficient for the restoration of the apparatus of civili. zation ? food , clothes , housing , the means of transportation and so on . The practical question would be , How is this equipment to be composed and assembled ? Individuals in isolation couod do next to nothing toward restoring the apparatus of civilization . The problem would be to effect the social correlations necessary for the re-creation of ranches , mines , mills , etc . Now as things stand in the mentality and habit of the United States , our devastated California could re-establish its necessary correlations in only one way . Let us see what that way would be : Capitalists ? i. e. , the owners of tools and productive materials ? would have nothing to say about it ; for there would be no tools and materials , and consequently no such ownership , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? by grace of Henry George . Does anybody suppose , therefore , that Californian society would start fresh and free , that it would be delivered from old habitual task-masters and from the yoke of privilege ? Is there any likelihood that its farmers , mechanics , chemists , artists , engineers and industrial organizers would conspire together in local communities , saying to one another : We have in our own minds and bodies the immaterial equipment of civilization , out of which a new and sufficient material equipment can be created in a year , or two or three . If at first we need corn or clothes and a shovel or two ? or even a gang-plough or a mining plant ? such things can be got from our neighbors to the Eastward , on the security of these same incorporeal values which are the basis of all wealth . Let us establish new credit-centres , for the administration of a rousing finance that shall put every man on his mettle , and really make things move . Let all of us back the notes of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goods . That would be a business-like arrangement and a sensible thing to do . But who that has observed and reflected upon the tortuous mentality of modern business communities , can suppose that anything so business-like and sensible would actually be done ? No , it may be said with confidence that in such a case as that supposed it would hardly occur to the business-communi-  |p621  ties of California to improvise banks or credit-centres devoted frankly to the production of goods . The reason is that Californians , like other Americans , are accustomed to do business from credit-centres that are operated in the interest of a creditorclass . And the idea of working a bank for the building of a town or the raising of the living-standard would be regarded " very fine for the millennium , " but for present and practical purposes , altogether visionary . The plain fact is that in all matters relating to large-scale production and distribution of goods , our modes of action and habits of thought have been adjusted to an impersonal and complicated custom of peonage . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being instituted by others than the people to whom the community owes money , or as being prosecuted for any other purpose than the increase of the community 's debt to such people . Thus our unfortunate Californians must not be expected to understand that all the intrinsic powers of modern finance are lodged in their own bodies . Their mechanics , engineers and industrial organizers have not acquired the habit of getting together on their own account for financial purposes . They lie under the general persuasion that finance begins with having a lot of money , and ends in an inscrutable mystery that no layman should hope to fathom . Therefore the thing that the Californians would actually do in the face of their emergency , is this : They would resort to certain leisurely and sedentary persons called bankers ? persons generally quite unapt and uninterested in the out-door processes whereby the earth is subdued and cities built , and skilled only in the processes whereby the claims of creditors are fastened upon the apparatus of civilization . These persons , acting as curators and trustees of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against society at large . Or if the documents had been lost their substance would persist in memory , and could be proved in court . It is upon these debt-certificates and the memory of claims against tools and materials that had ceased to exist , that the new fabric of Californian civilization would be constituted . Yes , it is true . So far as any reconstructive operations on a  |p622  considerable scale were concerned , the ranchers , mechanics , engineers and industrial organizers would twirl their fingers and kick their heels in bewilderment ? until the trustees of their creditors should say : Go on . So now ? having effected for our Californians this dubious deliverance from their imaginary plight ? let us return to the riddle of the socialists with a fresh affirmation of the truth that neither the landlord nor the capitalist is ruler of the modern world , that the working organization or business-system is the predominant force in modern politics and that the most vital function of business is finance ? the administration of credit . My point is that socialists have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving for the socialization of finance and the abolishment of the hampering and destructive peonage that is the central absurdity of the existing social order . The class-struggle is not due to free competition in industry or to the principle of private enterprise ; it is due to private appropriation of the most public of all social offices ? the administration of credit . A study of the mechanism of modern banking should yield appreciation of the fact that now-a-days banks control commerce as well as credit , since the bank by its discount arrangements virtually buys the goods from the seller and sells them to the buyer . The marketing of goods is indeed part of the creditprocess . The monopoly of credit and the monopoly of commerce are one and the same thing . Consequently the socialization of credit must include the social control of the market . We arrive therefore at the conclusion that the programme of a regenerated socialism should be the emancipation of personal enterprise in all the avenues of production , through the establishment of new social centres of credit , for the control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that the voltage of enterprise is abnormally low even in times of " prosperity . " The volume of enterprise is not sufficient to absorb more than a fraction of the working-forces of society . The existence of an unemployed class must perforce reduce the whole @#  |p623  body of wage-workers to a condition of servile dependence , mitigated by labor-organization and perpetual class-war . The social problem is to be solved by raising up in every community a social institution of credit and commerce , strong enough to check and cancel out the struggle for wage-lowering and price-raising power , and to turn the whole volume of social energy into an intense rivalry and competition for value-producing power . The rise of the modern credit system has so unsettled and fluidized the one-time solid estates of landlord , capitalist and money-lender , that a great social change releasing the fettered hands of the producers of real values , can now be accomplished with astonishing swiftness and ease . Indeed , as a civilized man , concerned with the maintenance of order and social continuity , one might hesitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method whereby financial control may be made to change hands ? were it not for the fact that only men of valor and worth can possibly turn the trick . The modern business-system is a social order that works so close to chemistry and physics and the elemental laws of human nature that the leverage of its control in every community gravitates to the strongest group that stands ready to receive it . If in the United States to-day this control is generally exercised by groups of men whose strength is mercantile and mercenary , rather than social and scientific , it is because such men are most representative of the actual American public , and because the men of social and scientific ability are not yet grouped . In any community that can develop a social centre devoted to the practical arts and the raising of the standard of living , the power of finance and the control of business can be made to pass , in a matter of months or weeks , out of the hands of manipulators and promoters , and into the hands that are fitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished on a large scale in Europe , in all the countries that have been taught by war the social feebleness and futility of plutocratic finance . If socialists are to turn their attention to this transplacement of the credit-centre , they must of course become more social . They must stop fighting for a class and must fight for society . They must set up a militant standard of art and science  |p624  ? the standard of the university and the public school ? and must rally to it all the people of every class who want to do better work as well as get better pay , and who are able to take a direct emotional interest in civilization . But there are socialists that will say : All that is too fine for the facts . The unsocial forces press too hard . The battle for life on the part of the oppressed and disinherited is too fierce . Labor can not stand for civilization and better workmanship until the exploiters yield ground . As things stand there is no elbow-room for social service and science . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of labor is as hard as the fight now waged by Germany or France . Yet these manage to clear a space for civilization ? behind the lines . The socialists in America can do so . It is a matter of strategy and discipline . Thus the strategy of the fight for a social socialism may require that socialists give a part of their energy to the backing up of organized labor . The labor movement , with its grim struggle for living-wages and a little chance to think , may be considered as a battle-line , holding the frontier of the new democratic society . But behind that cordon there should be free spaces worth fighting for ? a fair land with green fields , and the rising towers of the capital of a new country that can be loved . If the socialists would set their hands to the building of that city , they would escape from the devouring sphinx . They would not even be stale-mated.                   @ @
