txt Action by the I Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds this morning has brought the Democratic House face to face with the question whether or not it will make this session of Congress the most expensive the country has ever seen in times of peace . In spite of every argument from Chairman Morris Sheppard of Texas and an extraordinary appeal from Oscar W. Underwood , the Democratic leader of the House , who appeared to urge restraint upon the Democratic members , the committee was 11 to 2 for reporting a General Public Buildings bill . Mr. Underwood voted against the Dollar-a-Day Pension bill that passed two days ago , while Speaker Champ Clark supported it , but to-day 's action of the Buildings Committee means the first personal defeat Ur . Underwood has met in his conservative leadership of the House . The estimates of Secretary Fisher of the Department of the Interior credits the Pension bill with an increase of $75,000 , - 000 annually in Government expenditures if it becomes law , and in view of the deluge of bills already introduced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town and city in the country , it would be considered extraordinary if this bill is held down to the $40,000,000 mark . At this rate , as Mr. Underwood and Mr. Sheppard assured the committee this morning , this session will go on record as the most extravagant of any Congress . From a political point of view the line taken in appropriations by the Democrats has a particularly sinister aspect from the known fact that should the " pork bar'l " bills pass , Mr. Taft will be found waiting for them with his veto . If the Democrats should be able to put the Pension bill through the Senate , as they have through the House , and get it signed by the President , the political effect of such an obvious political sop would be doubtful . But every one knows that the President will veto it . The Democrats will be blamed ? as they have been blamed already by their own leaders  --  for breaking their economy pledges , and still no money will reach the districts . The same thing will happen in regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it will go to President Taft . The last time a public buildings bill of the old-fashioned variety reached the President it came from a Republican House . The bill carried with it items essential to the carrying on of work already begun and the President signed It . but he accompanied his signature with comment of a sort that Republicans were not accustomed to get from a Republican President . He promised flatly that if ever such a measure came to him again he would veto ? t . Since then the President has demonstrated his courage in the use of the veto  --  whether wisely or not  --  and it can be stated without doubt that he will veto this bill . That Mr. Underwood fully realized the serious situation which confronts his party in the House was manifest by his earnestness to-day . When he left the committee after the overwhelming vote against him he repaired to the Committee on Appropriations , where he saw Chairman Fitzgerald , who vainly opposed the Pension bill , and other prominent Democrats . They joined in their condemnation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it off . The most pertinent srggestion was that a caucus be called later to direct the committee not to report the bill . Mr. Underwood has never failed in bringing a caucus around to his views , but in trying to stop this measure , which affects nearly every district , it is admitted that he will have the fight of his life . Mr. Sheppard found this morning that his committee was beyond his control , and he at once appealed to the party leader . Mr. Underwood came , and he talked to that committee in the most serious fashion . He referred to the Pension bill and urged them not to make the first Democratic Congress in sixteen years the most expensive the country had ever seen in times of peace . Mr. Sheppard followed him in the same strain and the test came . Mr. Barnhart , an Indiana Democrat , who supported the Chairman throughout , moved to delay the bill . The Republicans , glad to furnish rope of a Democratic hanging , voted against the motion , and with the aid of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Ashbrook of Ohio , killed it to the tune of 8 to T. Then the motion to report a bill this session was made , and the landslide began . By a vote of 11 to 2 the motion prevailed . Only the Chairman and Mr. Barnhart voted against the measure . In the effort to hold the bill down Chairman Sheppard appointed a sub-committee to draft rules limiting appropriations for towns and cities according to their size . His highest hope is to keen the bill below the $20,000,000 mark , and that hope is not very strong . Most members have ' bills of their own for local appropriations pending , and the rules must be drawn to let those bills through . They will naturally carry with them a flood of similar measures introduced by Representatives not on the committee . " I want to see the Democratic Party put forth a Public Building bill that shall have no taint of ' pork ' about it , " said Chairman Sheppard . " I did not believe we should report such a bill this session . but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill that makes proper provision for the prompt execution of the work ordered by Congress and that provides for fireproof and hygienic structures instead of firetraps . We will be ready to work out such a. bill next session . But aside from that , we should not fly in the face of our promise to the people by piling up appropriations this session in excess Of ally Republican Congress that preceded us . When you come to think about what has been done by bpth arties in Congress of late , one is almost compelled to wonder what objection there is left to the initiative and referendum . Certainly it would seem that the people are more conservative than their representative . " Republicans are delighted at the prospect . They have been secretly laughing at the Democrats since the passage of the Pension bill , and congratulating themselves that it did not pass when the p Reublicans were in coost - of m voted for themeasure , nt itrol. is true . andthe they will get , what benefits may come from it . while they know that the blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parallel to the course the Democrats are following on their first - entrance to the Federal Treasury , in the they followed when they got back course to the " pork bz. ? r'l " in New York . There they set o new pace in appronriations and ' lost the State at the first election . The Possible effect of a similar course in Washington is reviving Republican hopes .
