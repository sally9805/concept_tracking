txt The Board of Directors of the New Haven Railroad decided unanimously last night that no dividend should be paid on its stock for the current quarter When asked if this meant a suspension of dividends for some time to come Howard Elliott . Chairman of the board , said the future must take care of itself . The passing of the dividend follows forty years of distributions of never less than W. per cent . Up to and including September , 1913 , the New Haven had paid to its stockholders 130 dividends in all , aggregating $158,477,817 . The company was incorporated in 1872 , end the next year paid 10 per cent. , which rate was maintained until 1595. with the exception of 1K9 , when 7% was paid . Beginning with 1896 the rate was reduced to S per cent. , and remained un changed until last June , when the stock was put on a 6 per cent basis . Two payments were made at this rate , the last on Sept 30 . The failure to declare any ' December dividend was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few days ago . At the annual stockholders ' meeting two months ago Mr. Elliott staled that the management hoped to maintain dividends at the rate of 4 per cent . The stock was then on a G per cent . basis , and Mr. Elliott 's statement was taker ' as notice of a reduction and the stock sagged off in the market . After hanging around 75 or 76 for some time it had a recovery to about SO . Stocli . Fell to New Low Record . Last week detailed figures of the results of ol.eration of the New Haven and all its suosidiaries for July , August , September , and October were made public They showed a material falling off from the preceding year , and there began lc be talk that a dividend for the last quarter might be omitted . Financial analyses appeared showing that even a quarterly dividend of 1 per cent . would be more than was earned , and there were rumblings of an injunction suit against the payment of any unearned dividends by interests that had attacked the proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Tuesday of this week a new low record of 71% was reached . Still the . general- expectation was that 1 per cent . would be declared for the quarter , and yesterday the stock recovered ; opening at 724 and closing at 72% . The low for the day was 713/4 and the high was 7514-E ; large proportion of the 5158,000,000 of stock in the hands of the public is held by institutions , estates , and individuals in New England , where for many years it had been regarded as the premier gilt-edged security . Many persons of moderate means have all their money invested in New Haven stock , and there was much talk last night of the sorry Christmas in store for these investors , following the reduction in tile dividend last Summer . Have ** Less to Spend . The quarterly dividend paid on Dec. 31 , 1912 , amounted to $3,578 , bS5 , so that the stockholders will be short just that much of the money they received on account of the distribution ordered : portly before Christmas last year . Dividends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent. , as 2 per cent . was paid in March . 1% per cent . in June , and W. per cent . in September . This is of importance in connect:on with the status of New Haven bonds as savings bank investments . Many States , including New York and those in New England , restrict such fond investments to obligations of cora'panies which have paid at least 4 per cent . for from five to ten years . Chairman Elliott said this was one of many points considered by the Directors , and he pointed out that the present action would not affect the status of these bonds because of the 5 per cent . distribution in the first three quarters . : ins attention was called to the fact that while the calendar year is the basis for the law in this State , in some of the New England States the fiscal year of the company is the basis . In the fiscal year beginning July 1 only lee per cent . has been paid . The fiscal year is not over yet , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status of the Londs depends on the preceding . fiscal year Their present status therefore depends on the fiscal year ended June 30 , 1912 , in which more than 4 per cent . was paid . " Morgan and Baker Absent . The meeting- of the board at which the dividend was passed lasted two and a half hours . Of the twenty-seven Directors , only six were absent . One of these was J. P. Morgan , who is in Europe , and the others were Edwin Milner of Moosup , Conn. ; James S. Elton of Waterbury , Frederick P. Brewster of New Haven , Henry K. ? of Stamford , and George F. Baker of New York . Those present were William Rockefeller and John T. Pratt of New York , Charles F. Brooker , Ansonia ; William Skinner , Holyoke ; D. Newton Barney , Farmington ; Robert W. Taft , Providence ; John L. Billard , Meriden ; T. De Witt Cuyler and Samuel Rea , Philadelphia ; Chairman Elliott and Laurence Minot , Boston ; Arthur T. Hadley , James S. Hemingway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Ha7ven ; Edward Milligan , Hartford ; Francis T. Maxwell , Rockville ; Morton F. Plant , Groton ; W. Murray Crane , Dalton ; James L. Richards , Newtonville , and Galen L. Stone , Brookline . Mr. Morgan was the only member of the Executive Committee absent . The announcement of the action of the Directors , made by Mr. Elliott , hinted at a coming sale of New Haven properties , which is to be expected as an outcome of the conferences between himself and ** General over the disintegration of the alleged transportation monopoly . Chairman Elliott 's Statement . Mr. Elliott said : The Directors have given much thought to the question of the dividend to be paid Dec. 31 . The New Haven is a strong company , owning valuable property , real estate and securities worth many millions of dollars . Some of this real estate and the property represented by the securities and the securities themselves can , in time , be marketed , and thus strengthen the cash resources of the company . It is very difficult to sell property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is unwise to attempt to do so until general conditions are better . During the calendar year 1913 the road has already paid dividends of 5 per cent. , amounting to $8,657,261.50 . For the four months of the fiscal year , July 1 to Oct. 31 , 1013 , the income available from all companies upon which the New Haven can draw , not counting the Boston &; Maine , Maine Central , and Merchants ' &; Miners ' Transportation Company , which need all their resources , is , in round numbers , $3,300,000 : estimating that the net income for November and December will be $500,000 , makes a possible total income for six months of 33,800 , - 000 . Deducting from this the 1 *per cent . dividend , $2,356,768 , paid Sept. 30 , leaves 81,533,231 , all of which is required for working capital . Trolley Lines to be Segregated . The company is now entering upon those months where the volume of business is apt , under normal conditions , to be less than during the months July to November inclusive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has resulted in increases in pay that will increase expenses for the present rascal year between $800,009 And 11.000,000 for the same number of employes . The improvements to which the company is already committed , in the interest of safety , efficiency , and greater convenience to the public , will take large sums of money . There are important lawsuits and investigations pending , the results of which are uncertain in their effect upon the general financial and corporate condition of this property . The Directors feel , therefore , that the welfare of the company , of its stockholders , and of the territory Served by the various lines will be conserved better under all the conditions now confronting the company by not declaring at this time a dividend . The Directors authorized the Chairman to arrange for a separate management of the Connecticut trolleys , and that L. S. Storrs , now Vice President of the company , be made President . This is one more step in arranging for close detailed supervision of the various properties in which the New Haven is interested , Mr. Elliott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Boston &; Maine and other properties , on the ground that negotiations were in progress with the Attorney General . Some of the special committees appointed several weeks ago to study this subject had made their final reports , he said , but nothing would be done by the company except in consultation with Mr. . Maine Central Pays $1.50 a Share . Meeting in Portland , Me. , yesterday the Directors of the Maine Central , a subsidiary of the New York , New Haven &; Hartford , declared the regular quarterly dividend of $1.50 a share .
