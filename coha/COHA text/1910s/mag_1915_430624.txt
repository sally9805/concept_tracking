 |p476  REVERIE OF A SPORTSMAN I SET out one morning in late August , with some potted-grouse sandwiches in one pocket and a magazine in the other , for a tramp toward Causdon . I had not been in that particular part of the moor since I used to go snipe-shooting there as a boy ? my first introduction , by the way , to sport . It was a very lovely day , almost too hot ; and I never saw the carpet of the moor more exquisite , ? heather , fern , the silvery-white cotton grass , dark peat turves , and green bog-moss , all more than customarily clear in hue under a very blue sky . I walked till two o'clock , then sat down in a little scoop of valley by a thread of stream , taking rise from an awkward-looking bog at the top . It was wonderfully lovely . A heron rose below me , and flapped away ; and while I was eating my potted grouse I heard the harsh cheep of a snipe , and caught sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bog . That must have been one of the bogs we used to shoot , ' I thought ; and having finished my snack of lunch , I rolled myself a cigarette , opened the magazine , and idly turned its pages . I had no serious intention of reading ? the calm and silence were too seductive ; but my attention became riveted by an exciting story of some man-eating lions , and I read on till I had followed the adventure to the death of the two ferocious brutes , and found my cigarette actually burning my fingers . Crushing it out against the dampish roots of the heather , I lay back with my eyes fixed on the sky ; thinking of nothing . 476 Suddenly I became conscious that between me and the sky a leash of snipe high up were flighting and twisting , and gradually coming lower ; I appeared indeed to have a sort of attraction for them . They would dash toward each other , seem to exchange ideas , and rush away again , like flies that waltz together for hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower and lower over me , I could almost swear I heard them whisper to each other with their long bills ; till presently I absolutely caught what they were saying : Look at him ! The ferocious brute ! Oh , look at him ! ' Amazed at such an extraordinary violation of all the laws of Nature , I was about to rub my eyes and ears , when I distinctly heard the Go-back , go-back ' of an old cock grouse , and on turning my head cautiously , saw him perched on a heathery knob within twenty yards of where I lay . Now , I knew very well that all efforts to introduce grouse on Dartmoor have been quite unsuccessful , since for some reason connected with the quality of the heather , the nature of the soil , or the over-mild dampness of the air , this king of game birds most unfortunately refuses to become domiciled there ; so that lecould hardly credit my senses . But suddenly I heard him also : Look at him ! Go back ! The ferocious brute ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just below ; and there , sure enough , was the first hare I had ever seen out on the full of the moor . I have always thought a hare a jolly beast , and not infrequently felt sorry  |p477  when I rolled one over ; it has a way of crying like a child if not killed outright . I confess , then , that in hearing it , too , whisper , Look at him ! The ferocious brute ! Oh , look at him ! ' I experienced the sensation that comes over one when one has not been quite fairly treated . But just at that moment , with a warm stirring of the air , there pitched within six yards of me a magnificent old blackcock , ? the very spit of that splendid fellow I shot last season at Balnagie , whose tail my wife now wears in her hat . He was accompanied by four gray hens , who , settling in a semi-circle , began at once , Look at him ! Look at him ! The ferocious brute ! Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with candor that I regretted the many times that I have spared gray hens , with the sportsmanlike desire to encourage their breed . For several bewildered minutes after that , I could not turn my eyes without seeing some bird or other alight close by me : more and more grouse , and black game , pheasants , partridges , ? not only the excellent English bird , but the very sporting Hungarian variety , ? and that unsatisfactory red-legged Frenchman which runs any distance rather than get up and give you a decent shot at him . There were woodcock too , those twisting delights of the sportsman 's heart , whose tiny wingfeather trophies have always given me a distinct sensation of achievement when pinned in the side of my shootingcap ; wood-pigeons too , very shy and difficult , owing to the thickness of their breast-feathers , and , after all , only coming under the heading of sundry ' ; wild duck , with their snaky dark heads , that I have shot chiefly in Canada , lurking among rushes in twilight at flighting time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; excellent eating too , with red pepper and sliced oranges in oil ! Certain other sunA SPORTSMAN 477 dries kept coming also : landrails , a plump , delicious little bird ; green and golden plover ; even one of those queer little creatures , moorhens , that always amuse one by their quick , quiet movements , plaintive note , and quaint curiosity , though not really , of course , fit to shoot , with their niggling flight and fishy flavor ! Ptarmigan too , a bird I admire very much , but have only once or twice succeeded in bringing clown , shy and scarce as it is in Scotland . And , side by side , the alpha and omega of the birds to be shot in these islands , a capercailzie and a quail . I well remember shooting the latter in a turnip-field in Lincolnshire ? scrap of a bird , the only one I ever saw in England . Apart from the pleasurable sensation at its rarity , I recollect feeling that it was almost a mercy to put the little thing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , was that loon or Northern diver that I shot with a rifle off Denman Island , as it swam about fifty yards from the shore . A handsome bird ; I still have the mat it made . One bird only seemed to refuse to alight , remaining up there in the sky , and uttering continually that trilling cry which makes it perhaps the most spiritual of all birds that can be eaten , ? I mean , of course , the curlew . I do n't think I ever shot one . They fly , as a rule , very high , and seem to have a more than natural distrust of the human being . This curlew ? ah ! and a Blue Rock ( I have always despised pigeon-shooting ) ? were the only two winged creatures that one can shoot for sport in this country , that did #not come and sit round me . There must have been , I should say , as many hundreds altogether as I have shot in my time ? a tremendous number . There they sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side to side , just as I have seen penguins doing on the films that explorers bring back from the Antarctic ; and all the time  |p478  repeating to each other those amazing words : Look at him ! The ferocious brute ! Oh , look at him ! ' Then , to my increased astonishment , I saw behind the circles of the birds a number of other animals besides the hare . At least five kinds of deer ? the red , the fallow , the roe , the common deer , whose name I 've forgotten , that one finds in Vancouver Island , and the South African springbok , that swarm in from the Karoo at certain seasons , among which I had that happy week once in Namaqualand , shooting them from horseback after a gallop to cut them off ? very good eating as camp fare goes , and making nice rugs if you sew their skins together . There , too , was the hyena I missed , probably not altogether ; but he got off , to my chagrin ? queer-looking brute ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Though , like everybody else , I 've done such a lot of it , I ca n't honestly say I 've ever cared much for shooting rabbits , though the effect is neat enough when you get them just right , and they turn head over heels ? and anyway , the prolific little brutes have to be kept down . There , too , actually was my wild ostrich ? the one I galloped so hard after , letting off my Winchester at half a mile , only to see him vanish over the horizon . Next him was that bear whose lair I came across at the Nanaimo Lakes . How I did lurk about to get that fellow ! And , by Jove ! close to him , two cougars . I never got a shot at them , never even saw one of the brutes all the time I was camping in Vancouver Island , where they lie fiat along the branches over your head , waiting to get a chance at deer , sheep , dog , pig , or anything handy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with their greenish cats ' eyes ? powerful-looking creatures ! And next them sat a little meerkat ? not much larger than a weasel ? without its head ! Ah yes ! ? that trial shot , as we trekked out from Rous 's farm , and I wanted to try the little new rifle I had borrowed . It was sitting over its hole fully seventy yards from the wagon , quite unconscious of danger . I just took aim and pulled ; and there it was , without its head , fallen across its hole . I remember well how pleased our boys ' were . And I too ! Not a bad little rifle , that ! Outside the ring of beasts I could see foxes moving , not mixing with the stationary creatures , as if afraid of suggesting that I had shot them , instead of being present at their deaths in the proper fashion . One , quite a cub , kept limping round on three legs ? the one , no doubt , whose pad was given me , out tubbing , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat-box , and forgot it , so that I was compelled to throw the whole stinking show away . There were quite a lot of grown foxes ; it certainly showed delicacy on their part , not sitting down with the others . There was really a tremendous crowd of creatures altogether by this time ! I should think every beast and bird I ever shot or even had a chance of killing , must have been there , and all whispering , Look at him ! The ferocious brute ! Oh , look at him ! ' Animal lover , as every true sportsman is , those words hurt me . If there is one thing on which we sportsmen pride ourselves , and legitimately , it is a humane feeling toward all furred and feathered creatures ? and as every one knows , we are foremost in all efforts to diminish their unnecessary sufferings . The corroboree about me which they were obviously holding became , as I grew used , to their manner of talking , increasingly audible . But it was the quail 's words that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said ; said I was good , too ! ' I do not believe ' ? this was the first hare speaking ? that he shot me for t  |p479  that reason ; he did shoot me , and I was jugged , but he would n't touch me . And the same day he shot eleven brace of partridges , did n't he ? ' Twenty-two partridges assented . And he only ate two of you , all told ? that proves it . ' The hare 's words had given me relief ; for I somehow disliked intensely the gluttonous notion conveyed by the quail that I shot merely in order to devour the result . Any one with the faintest instincts of a sportsman will bear me out in this . When the hare had spoken there was a murmur all round . I could not at first make out its significance , till I heard one of the cougars say , We kill only when we want to eat ' ; and the bear , who , I noticed , was a lady , added , No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quite clear , I caught the quacking words of a wild duck : We eat every worm we kill . ' Then again from the whole throng came that shivering whisper : Look at him ! The ferocious brute ! Oh , look at him ! ' In spite of their numbers , they seemed afraid of me , seemed actually to hold me in a kind of horror ? me , an animal lover , without a gun ! I felt it bitterly . How is it , ' I thought , that not one of them seems to have an inkling of what it means to be a sportsman , not one of them seems to comprehend the instinct which makes one love sport just for the ? ' I was going to add the skill and ? er ? danger of it , ' when the hare spoke again . Foxes , ' it said , kill for the love of killing . Man is a kind of fox . ' A violent dissent at once rose from the foxes , till one of them , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as we can , but we should always carry them off and eat them ourselves , if man gave us time ? the ferocious brutes ! ' You can not expect much of foxes , but it certainly struck me as unfair the way he thus put his wanton destructiveness off A. SPORTSMAN 479 on man , especially when he must have known how carefully we preserve him , in the best interests of sport . A pheasant ejaculated shrilly , He killed sixty of us one day to his own gun , and went off that same evening without eating even a wing ! ' And again came that shivering whisper : Look at him ! The ferocious brute ! Oh , look at him ! ' It was too absurd ! As if they could not realize that a sportsman shoots almost entirely for the mouths of others . But , after all , one must remember that altruism is a purely human attribute . They get a big price for us ! ' said a woodcock , especially if they shoot us early . I fetched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds ! The modern sportsman knows nothing of what happens after he has shot them . All that is left to the butler and the keeper . Beaters , of course , and cartridges must be paid for , to say nothing of the sin of waste . I would not think them so much worse than foxes , ' said a rabbit , if they did n't often hurt you , so that you take hours dying . I was seven hours dying in great agony , and one of my brothers was twelve . Were n't you , brother ? ' A second rabbit nodded . But perhaps they 're better than gins , ' he said . Remember mother ! ' Ah ! ' a partridge muttered , foxes at all events do bite your head off clean . But men often break your wing , or your leg , and leave you ! ' And again that shivering whisper rose : Look at him ! The ferocious brute ! Oh , look at him ! ' By this time the whole thing was so getting on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed at them ; but a weight as of lead seemed to bind me to the ground , and all I could do'tvas to thank God that they did not seem to know of my condition , for , though there were no man-eaters among them , I could not tell what they might do if they realized that I was helpless , the sentiments of chivalry and zn 480 REVERIE OF  |p480  generosity being confined to man , as we know . Yes , ' said the capercailzie slowly , I am a shy bird , and was often shot at before this one got me ; and though I 'm strong , my size is so against me that I always took a pellet or two away with me ; and what can you do then ? Those ferocious brutes take the shot out of their faces and hands when they shoot each other by mistake , as we see from a distance ; but we have no chance to do that . ' A snipe said shrilly , What I object to is that he did n't eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in on toast at the fifth course ; it was n't dignified . ' Ferocious brute , killing everything he sees . ' I felt my blood fairly boil , and longed to cry out , You beasts ! You know that we do n't kill everything we see ! We leave that to cads , and cockneys , and Italians . ' But just as I had no power of movement , so I seemed to have no power of speech . And suddenly a little voice , high up over me , piped down , He 's right there ; they never shoot us larks . ' I have always loved the lark ; how grateful I felt to that little creature ? till it added , They do worse ; they take and shut us up in little traps of wire till we pine away ! Ferocious brutes ! ' In all my life I think I never was more disappointed ! The second cougar spoke : He once passed within spring of me . What do you say , friends ; shall we go for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go for him ! Ferocious brute ! Oh , go for him ! ' And I heard the sound of hundreds of soft wings and pads ruffling and shuffling . And , knowing that I had no power to move an inch , I shut my eyes . Lying there motionless , as a beetle that shams dead , I felt them creeping , creeping , till all round me and over me was the sound of nostrils sniffing ; and every second I expected to feel the nip of teeth and beaks in the fleshy parts of me . But nothing came , and with an effort I reopened my eyes . There they were , hideously close , with an expression on their faces that I could not read : a sort of wry look , every nose and beak turned a little to one side . And suddenly I heard the old fox saying , It 's impossible , with a smell like that ; we could never eat him ! ' From every one of them came a sort of sniff or sneeze as of disgust , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hyena mutter , He 's not wholesome ? not wholesome ? the ferocious brute ! ' The utter relief of that moment was entirely swamped by my indignation that these impudent birds and beasts should presume to think that I , a British sportsman , would not be good to eat . Then that beastly hyena added , If we killed him and buried him for a few days , he might be tolerable . ' An old cock grouse called out at once , Go back ! Let us hang him ! We are always well hung . They like us a little decayed ? ferocious brutes ! Go back ! ' Once more I felt , from the stir and shuffle , that my fate hung in the balance ; and once more I shut my eyes , lest they might be tempted to begin on them . Then , to my infinite relief , I heard the cougar ? have we not always been told that they were the friends of man ? ? mutter , Pah ! No ! It 's clear we could never eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , we do not touch ! ' All the birds cried out in chorus , No ! That is crow 's work . ' And I felt that I was saved again . Then , to my horror , that infernal loon shrieked , Shall we not kill him and have him stuffed ? specimen of , Ferocious Brute ! Or fix his skin on a tree , and look at it ? as he did with me ! ' For a full minute I could feel the currents of opinion swaying over me , at this infamous proposal ; then that old blackcock , the one whose tail is in my I.  |p481  wife 's hat , said sharply , Specimen ! He 's not good enough ! ' And , once more , for all my indignation at that . ratuitous insult , I breathed freely . ' Come ! ' said the lady bear quietly : ' Let us dribble on him a little ; and go . The ferocious brute is not worth more ! ' And , during what seemed to me an eternity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little saliva , looking into my eyes the while with a sort of horror and contempt , then vanished on the moor . The last to come up was the little meerkat without its head . It stood there , and , since it could neither look at me nor drop saliva , said , God forgive you , ferocious brute ! I was very happy ! ' And it too withdrew . And from all around , out of invisible presences in the air and the heather , came once more the shivering whisper , Look at him ! The ferocious brute ! Oh , look at him ! ' I sat up . There was a trilling sound in my ears . Above me in the blue a curlew was passing , uttering its cry . Yes ! Thank heaven ! ? I had been asleep ! My nightmare had been caused by the potted grouse , and the pressure of the Review , which had lain , face downwards , on my chest , open at the page where I had been reading about the man-eating lions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows what tricks of disproportion little things will play with the mind when it is not under reasonable control . And , to get the unwholesome taste out of my mouth , I at once jumped up , and started for home at a round pace .
