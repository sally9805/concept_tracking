ON the 23d of October , 1788 , Francis Hopkinson writes to Thomas Jefferson , Minister Plenipotentiary to the Court of France , anent certain " vinegar " which Mr. Jefferson had promised to send him and which has not yet arrived . " It will be a great Regale , " says he , " and very acceptable to me . I thank you for it heartily . I hope it will not loose its way ? but it is long coming . " Mr. Hopkinson then mentions that he in his turn is about to make a present , namely , of a book of songs ? " words and music all my own ; the music is now engraving , when finish 'd I will do myself the Pleasure of sending a copy ro Miss Jefferson . " The " Seven Songs " were sent in due season , and the harpsichord for Patsy Jefferson 's use had preceded them , according to the bill of lading which is preserved among the Jefferson papers , having been " Shipped by the Grace of God in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August , 1787 . " And so God send the good Ship to her desir 'd Port in Safety , Amen . By these means it came about that Patsy Jefferson sat at her harpsichord one day early in 1789 , in Paris , playing one of these Hopkinson songs to her father ? the last song of all , beginning : Mr. Jefferson " looked toward the fire , " where sat his second daughter , a little girl ten years old . She was " all in tears . " He asked her " if she was sick . " She said , " No , but the tune was so mournful . " Nor was it perhaps strange that the demure little girl should be sensitive to the woes of a lone traveler  - -  she could not , indeed , have felt inexperienced by way of the passage perilous herself . In July , 1784 , two years after their mother 's death , Patsy had accompanied her father to France , while Lucy and Polly Mary , two and five years old , remained in Virginia at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Jefferson 's sister . Mr. Jefferson had not been more than a month in Paris when these two children and Mrs. Eppes 's children contracted the whooping-cough , of which Lucy Eppes and Lucy Jefferson both died in November . News of this did not reach Mr. Jefferson until January z6 , 1785 . He then began to arrange to have Polly sent to him , writing letter after letter to Mr. and Mrs. Eppes , anticipating every difficulty by the most detailed instructions , and these difficulties were not a few . First there were the " equinoxes , " on whose account she must set sail from Virginia " in the months of April , May , June , or July . " Then a safe sailing-vessel must be chosen , " one that should have performed one voyage at least , but not be more An RigIlts Reserved , than four or five years old . " Some responsible person must attend her . " A careful negro woman , as Isabel , if she has had the smallpox , would suffice under the patronage of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eppes under date of August 3o , 1785 . On the zoth of September he writes to the little girl herself : I wish so much to see you that I have desired your uncle and aunt to send you to me . I know , my dear Polly , how sorry you will be , and ought to be , to leave them and your cousins ; but your sister and myself can not live without you , and after a while we will carry you hack again to see your friends in Virginia . Inthe meantime you shall be taught here to play on the harpsichord , to draw , to dance , to read and talk French . . . You shall have as many dolls and playthings as you want for yourself , or to send to your cousins when you shall have opportunities . Two days later he writes to Mrs. Eppes : Would to God the great step was taken and taken safely ; I mean that which is to place her on this side of the Atlantic . . . . Kiss dear Polly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we find the little person most concerned taking cognizance of these letters and others of a like nature in a manner both vigorous and to the point . DEAR PAPA says she , ? I long to see you , and hope that you and sister Patsy are well ; give my love to her and tell her that I long to see her , and hope that you and she will come very soon to see us . I hope that you will send me a doll . I am very sorry that you have sent for me . I do n't want to go to France , I had rather stay with Aunt Eppes . Aunt Carr , Aunt Nancy , and Cousin Polly Carr are here . Your most happy and dutiful daughter , Potty JEFFERSON . DEAR PA-PA , ? I should be very happy to see you , but I can not go to France , and hope that you and sister Patsy are well . Your affectionate daughter . Adieu . MARY JEFFERSON . And again , with a quite Jeffersonian persistence : DEAR PAPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you must come to Uncle Eppes's. house . POLLY JEFFERSON . In spite of these finalities the letters still go on , and the catalogue of obstacles continues , with every possible provision for their removal from Pony 's path across the sea . Among the most serious dangers was perhaps that to be apprehended from the Algerians , who had captured two American vessels late in 1785 and were holding " twenty-two . of our citizens in slavery . " " I do not think the insurance against them on vessels coming to France will be worth one-half per cent. , " says Mr. Jefferson , " but who can estimate the value of a half per cent , on the fate of a child ? . . . so that unless you hear from myself ? not trusting the information of any other person on earth ? that peace is made with the Algerians , do not send her but in a vessel of French or English property ; for these vessels alone arc safe from prize by the barbarians . " At the storm-center was another deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote to Mrs. Trist , " You would have found her ; among the most amiable women on earth . doubt whether you would ever have got away from her . " The kind Aunt Eppes , while recognizing the august parental authority , was nevertheless a natural partisan of Polly , not only from motives of intense anxiety , but also because she dearly loved the littlegirl she had mothered so lung . Toward the end of March , 787 , she writes : I never was more anxious to hear From you than at present , in hopes of yuur countermanding your orders with regard to dear Polly . We have made use of every stratagem to prevail on her to consent to visit you without effect . She is more averse to it than I could have supposed . Either of my children would with pleasure take her place for the number of good things she is promised . However , Mr. Eppes has two or three different prospects of conveying her , to your satisfaction , 1 hope , if we do not hear from you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed you by my dear Polly , who I most ardently wish may reach you in the health she is in at present . I shall be truly wretched till I hear of her being safely landed with you . The children will spend a day or two on board the ship with her , which I hope will reconcile her to it . For God 's sake give us the earliest intelligence of her arrival . So the day came , and Polly went on board accompanied by her little friends . " While the child was one day asleep , " Miss Randolph tells us , " they were all taken away , and before she fairly awoke the vessel had cut loose from her moorings and was fairly launched on the tedious voyage before her . " Meanwhile , on the other side of the water , preparations were made to receive her . She must be taken charge of in London , and to that end , six months before her arrival , Mr. Jefferson sends to Abigail Adams a letter ; of which , as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge is torn , leaving parts of some of the words missing . PARIS , Dec. 21 , 1786 . DEAR MADAM , ? My friends write me that they will send my little daughltcr to me by a vessel which sails in May for England . I have tlaken the liberty to tell them that you will be so good as to take her ! under ! your wing till I can have no-tice to send for her , which I shall do exlpress in the mo-ment of my knowing she is arrived . She is about 8 years old , and will be in the care of her nurse , a black woman , to whom she is confided with safety . I know your goodness too well to scruple the giving this direction before I had asked your permission . I beg you to accept assurances of the constant esteem with which I have the honor to be , Dear Madam , your most obe-dient and most humble serv't , TH . JEFFERSON . Early in March Mr. Jef-ferson set off for the South of France on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Toulon he writes to Patsy , now quite at home in the school in the Abbave Royal de Panthe-mont in Paris : " Our dear Polly will certainly come to us this summer . . . When she arrives she will become a precious charge on your hands . The dif-ference of your age , and your common loss of a mother , will put that office on you . " Patsy , from her convent , which was to be Polly 's home in Paris , too , wrote eagerly to her father in her turn about the little sister 's corning . But it is Mrs. Adams in London who experiences the real ex-citement of the little girl 's arrival , and out of a manila-paper case , among the uncatalogucd manuscripts of the Library of Congress , she speaks for herself and for Polly , in a letter to Mr. Jefferson : LONDON , fuse 26 , 1787 . MY DEAR have to congratulate you upon the safe arrival of your Little Daughter , whom I have only a few moments ago received . She is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her countenance , but at present everything is strange to her &; She was very loth to try New Friends for old . She was so much attached to the Captain and he to her , that it was with no small regret that 1 separated her from him , but I daresay I shall reconcile her in a day or two . I tell her that I did not see her Sister cry once , she replies that her Sister was older and ought to do better , besides she had her pappa with her . I shew here the seal obscures the word your picture . She says she can not know it . How should she when she should not know you . A few hours acquaintance and we shall be quite Friends I daresay . I hope we may expect the pleasure of another visit from you , now I have so strong an inducement to tempt you ; if you could bring Miss Jefferson with you it would reconcile her little Sister to the thoughts of taking a journey ; it would be proper that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nurse whom you expected to have attended her was Sick and unable to come . She has a Girl of about 15 or i6 with her , the Sister of the Servant you have with you . As I presume you have but just returned from your late excursion you will not put yourself to any inconvenience or Hurry in coming or sending for her ; you may rely upon every attention towards her and every care in my power . I have just endeavored to amuse her by telling her that I would carry her to Sadler 's Wells ; after describing the Amusement to her , with an honest Simplicity , " I had rather , " says She , " see Captain Ramsey one moment than all the fun in the World . " . . . Miss Polly sends her duty to you and Love to her Sister and says she will try to be good and not cry , so she has wip 'd her eyes and lay 'd down to Sleep . believe me dear Sir Affectionately yours , &c; &c; A. ADAMS . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of mind . On the next day she writes again : LONDON , Jun. 27 , 1787 . DEAR SIR , ? I had the Honour of address-ing you yesterday and informing you of the safe Arrival of your Daughter . She was but just come when I sent off my letter by the post , and the poor little Girl was very unhappy being wholly left to Strangers ; this , however , lasted only a few Hours and Miss is as contented to day as she was miserable yesterday . She is indeed a fine Child . Ihave taken her out to day and purchased her a few articles which she could nut well do without &; I hope they will meet your approbation . The girl who is with her is quite a child , and Captain Ramsey is of opinion will he of so little service that he had better carry her back with him , but of that you will be a judge . She seems fond of the child and appears good Natur 'd . . you will find it , I imagine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did to get her from the Captain . She stands by me while I write and asks if I write every day to her pappa ? but as I have never had so interesting a subject to him to write upon The page is torn off here . Eight days after this , a Frenchman named Petit , Mr. Jefferson 's housekeeper , who afterward came to America in that capacity , arrived with instructions to convey Polly to Paris . This , from the point of view of Polly and her new friend Mrs. Adams , was not so easy . So Mrs. Adams writes immediately : LONDON , July 6 , 1787 , MY DEAR SIR , ? If I had thought you would so soon have sent for your dear little Girl , I should have been tempted to have kept her arrival here from you a secret . I am really loth to part with her and she , last evening , upon petit 's arrival , was thrown into all her former distress , and bursting into Tears told me it would he as hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been so often deceived that she will not quit me a moment lest she should be carried away , nor can 1 scarcely prevail upon her to see petit : tho ' she says she can not remember you yet she has been taught to consider you with affection and fondness , and depended upon your coming for her . She told me this morning , that as she had left all her friends in Virginia to come over the ocean to see you she did think you would have taken the pains to have come here for her &; not have sent a man whom she can not understand . I express her own words . I expostulated with her upon the long journey you had been , &; the difficulty you had to come and upon the care , kindness and attention of petit , whom I so well knew , but she can not yet hear me . She is a child of the quickest sensibility and the maturest understanding that I have ever met with for her years . She had been 5 weeks at sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first day of her arrival she was as rough as a little sailor ; and then she had been decoyed from the Ship , which made her very angry ; and no one having any authority over her I was apprehensive I should meet with some trouble , but where there are such materials to work upon as I have found in her there is no danger . She listened to my admonitions and attended to my advice and in two days was restored to the amiable lovely Child which her Aunt had formed her , in short she is the favourite of every creature in the House , and I can not but feel , Sir , how many pleasures you must lose by committing her to a convent ; vet , situated as you are , you can not keep her with you . The Girl she has with her wants more care than the Child and is wholly incapable of looking carefully after her , without some Superiour to direct her . As both Miss Jefferson Sr the Maid had cloaths only proper for the Sea , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should have done had they been my own to the amount of about eleven or r z Guineys ; the particulars I will send by Petit . Captain Ramsey has said that he would accompany your daughter to Paris , provided she would not go without him , but this would be putting you to an expence that can perhaps be avoided by petits staying a few days longer ; the greatest difficulty in familiarizing her to him is on account of the language . I have not the heart to put her into a carriage against her will and send her away from me almost in a Frenzy , as I know will be the case , unless I can reconcile her to the thoughts of going ; and I have given her my word that petit shall stay until I can hear again from you . Books are her great delight , and I have furnished her out a little library , and she reads to me by the hour with great distinctness and comments on what she reads with much propriety . Four days more and Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wrote you last I did not know that petit had taken places in the Stage and paid for them ; this being the case I have represented it to your little Daughter and endeavor 'd to prevail with her to consent to going at the time appointed . She says if I must go I will but I can not help crying so pray do n't ask me . I should have taken great pleasure in presenting her to you here , as you would have then seen her with her most engaging countenance . Some lines of an old Song frequently occur to me as different objects affect her . What she thinks in her Heart You may read in her Eyes For knowing no art She needs no disguise . I never saw so intelligent a countenance in a child before , and the pleasure she has given me is an ample compensation for any little services 1 have been able to render her . I can easily conceive the earnest desire you must have to embrace so lovely a child after so long a separation from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next week upon a journey into the CounTHE ROMANTIC VOYAGE ty of Devonshire , has prevailed with me to consent to parting with her so soon , but most reluctantly I assure you : her temper , her disposition , her sensibility are all formed to delight , yet perhaps at your first interview you may find a little roughness , but it all subsides in a very little time , and she is soon attached by kindness . I enclose a memorandum of the articles purchased . I have desired petit to Buy me 12 ells of black lace at 8 Livres per ell &; dozen of white &; one of coloned gloves . Col. Smith will take them when he returns . You will be so good as to iet me hear from my dear little Girl by the first post after her arrival . My love to her sister , whom I congratulate upon such an acquisition . . . . With sentiments of the highest esteem , I am , dear Sir , your Humble Servant , A. ADAMS . It is pleasant to think of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feathers , " arriving safely , at last , at her journey 's end . How glad we are that Mrs. Adams could not resist the " blew sash ribbon " ! There appears to be very little by way or description of Polly 's face and features in the records we have . Mr. Randall , however , gives a clue in saying that she had " that exquisite beauty possessed by her mother ? that beauty which the experienced learn to look upon with dread , because it betrays a physical organization too delicately fine to withstand the rough shocks of the world . " At least we may be sure that little Polly afforded a pleasant sight to the eyes of her father and sister , from whom she was never long separated afterward while she lived . During her first week with her father , Patsy came and stayed with her , " leading her from time to time to the convent until she became familiarized to it . " In 1784 , after a visit to this convent at the time when Patsy Jefferson first took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had written in her journal : " This is considered the best and most genteel convent in Paris .. . There are three princesses who are here for their education , and are distinguished from the others by a blue ribbon on the shoulder . " Here we must leave our little Polly , " perfectly happy , " her father assures Mrs. Eppes on the 28th of July , only eighteen days after she had come to her brave decision : " If I must go I will , but I can not help crying . " Through all the changes and chances of life this little creature of smiles and tears kept Mrs. Adams 's affection , in spite of that lady 's later grievances against Mr. Jefferson ; and the news of the death , in April , 2804 , of Maria Jefferson Eppes , a young matron not yet twenty-six , leaving a son and a little Polly of her own , brought the first word of sympathy for many years from Abigail Adams to Thomas Jefferson .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
