SCENE : Drawing Room of the residence of DOCTOR SEELIG . Two small sofas set at right angles to the fireplace form a kind of inglenook . At the outer ends of the sofas are two marble pedestals , each surmounted by an antique vase . Time : An afternoon in late September . VEDAH SEELIG , a young girl , is at the piano and playing . After a few bars there is the sound of a door closing . VEDAH listens , then speaks . VEDAH Papa ? DR . SEELIG Yes . VEDAH Alone ? DR . SEELIG Alone . He enters from the hall . VEDAH meets and kisses him . Mother home ? VEDAH She is lying down . DR . SEELIG Is mother ill ? VEDAH Only resting . DR . SEELIG Ah  --  where is the tea ? VEDAH It is n't time . DR . SEELIG Regarding his watch . Quarter of five . VEDAH Laughing . But no company . p. 3 DR . SEELIG Company ? My dear Vedah . Tea with me is not a function  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing . Holland . HOLLAND Pausing at doorway . Yes , sir . DR . SEELIG Tell the butler  --  some tea . HOLLAND goes . VEDAH Now , Papa . DR . SEELIG Affectionately imitating her . " Now , Papa . " You want to drive me into dissipation . VEDAH But the others will think they 're late . DR . SEELIG I sha n't grudge them that accuracy  --  they are late . I do n't wonder at some of them , but I 'm astonished at De Lota . VEDAH Pause . De Lota ? DR . SEELIG Yes . VEDAH Is Mr. De Lota coming ? DR . SEELIG I asked him to come . VEDAH Why ? DR . SEELIG Meet your artist  --  VEDAH But , Papa  --  DR . SEELIG Playfully . Well , scold me. p. 4 VEDAH But  --  Papa . DR . SEELIG First to famish for a little tea  --  and then to be reprimanded for inviting a prospective son-in-law . VEDAH I do n't want Mr. Burrill and Mr. De Lota to meet . DR . SEELIG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SEELIG Why not ? VEDAH I have n't told anybody of my engagement to Mr. De Lota . DR . SEELIG Well ? VEDAH Well  --  he carries himself so  --  so  --  DR . SEELIG Proudly ? VEDAH So much like a proprietor that it 's hard to explain to others  --  strangers especially . DR . SEELIG By " strangers especially " you mean Mr. Burrill ? VEDAH Yes . DR . SEELIG Is Mr. Burrill 's opinion important ? VEDAH His refinement is important . DR . SEELIG Refinement ? VEDAH Yes  --  the quality that you admire in men  --  the quality that Mr. De Lota sometimes lacks . p. 5 DR . SEELIG When  --  for example ? VEDAH I 've just told you . DR . SEELIG Well , tell me again . VEDAH When he gives the impression of  --  of  --  owning me . DR . SEELIG Pause . But after all , is n't there a compliment in that ? VEDAH There 's considerable annoyance in it . DR . SEELIG Oh  --  A butler enters , gets tea table , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ De Lota announced your engagement his manner might  --  seem more natural  --  to strangers especially . VEDAH I do n't wish it announced . DR . SEELIG It was to have been announced in September , was n't it ? VEDAH I know  --  but I 'm waiting . HOLLAND Appearing in doorway and announcing . Mrs. Clayton . MRS . ELINOR CLAYTON , a blonde and blue-eyed woman of delicate charm and distinction , enters . VEDAH Elinor ! Kisses her . How good of you to come so early . p. 6 ELINOR Doctor . DR . SEELIG Shaking hands with MRS . CLAYTON . Elinor . ELINOR Seeing the empty tea table . Am I the first ? VEDAH The very first . DR . SEELIG If I 'm not  --  counted . ELINOR You 're first in every situation , Doctor . To VEDAH . I hope to have a moment with your father before the others call . VEDAH Professionally ? ELINOR Do n't I look the invalid ? How 's your mother ? VEDAH Fine , thank you . ELINOR And to see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . VEDAH I 'll leave you together while I tell Mama . She goes out . ELINOR Sitting . When I came to see you last time  --  ? DR . SEELIG Yes ? ELINOR You told me the truth about myself ? DR . SEELIG My dear Mrs. Clayton . p. 7 ELINOR Of course you did as far as you told me anything , but I thought you might be withholding something . DR . SEELIG I do n't know a woman in better physical condition . He takes a chair beside her . ELINOR Well , I want you to give me something to make me sleep . DR . SEELIG Sleep ! ELINOR I wake about four in the morning and  --  stay awake . DR . SEELIG How often has this happened ? ELINOR Ever since I came to see you  --  and a week before that . DR . SEELIG ' M  --  Pause . Anything troubling you ? ELINOR No . DR . SEELIG Do you stay wide awake or  --  only partly so ? ELINOR Awake . DR . SEELIG Thinking ? ELINOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  everything . DR . SEELIG But principally  --  ? ELINOR Principally  --  Pause . That old trouble at Atlantic City . p. 8 DR . SEELIG Anything in Frank 's conduct to revive that ? ELINOR No  --  but  --  DR . SEELIG What ? ELINOR I think  --  sometimes that I felt that trouble more than any of us  --  even I thought I felt it . DR . SEELIG You forgave Frank , did n't you ? ELINOR Yes  --  but it was a good deal for a wife to overlook . DR . SEELIG You mean you did n't forgive him ? ELINOR I mean the hurt was deeper than I knew  --  deeper than I could know except as time taught me its depth . DR . SEELIG Your thoughts on that are what wake you in the early morning ? ELINOR And keep me awake . DR . SEELIG Well , let 's talk about it . ELINOR I do n't wish to talk about it , Doctor . She moves to a seat near the window . DR . SEELIG In surgery we sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on the surface only . The treatment is to re-open it entirely . A mental trouble has its analogy . Better talk of it . He goes to a seat beside her . Frank was foolish . Under the law you might have abandoned him to his folly . In that case , with his temperament  --  Pause . Two years ? He 'd have been  --  well  --  " a failure " is too gentle a description . As it is , consider his advancement in the two years  --  his development  --  power . All due to your wisdom , my dear Elinor  --  to your wisdom and forbearance  --  to your love for him  --  Pause . That sums it up  --  you do love him . p. 9 ELINOR Earnestly . Yes . DR . SEELIG Frank is important  --  he influences public opinion with his magazines and papers . He addresses an audience of two millions , let us say . In the great scheme of the world Frank is a factor  --  a big factor  --  is n't he ? ELINOR Yes  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there you are . Your abiding love for him made all the difference between success and failure . All the forces radiating from Frank really do so because of your loyalty at a supreme moment . That 's a large commission , is n't it ? The fates made you their chosen instrument  --  their deputy . If Frank had n't needed help you could n't have given it , could you ? ELINOR Of course not . DR . SEELIG Rising energetically . Well , do n't regret having been useful  --  be proud of it . ELINOR But a man who has once committed such a fault  --  may do so again . DR . SEELIG Pleasantly . You 're assuming that we learn nothing from our mistakes  --  we men . ELINOR Well , do you ? p. 10 DR . SEELIG Smiling . As a physician  --  I 'd hate to tell you how much . ELINOR I could n't go through it again . DR . SEELIG You wo n't have to . ELINOR Going to SEELIG . And you wo n't give me anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of view something ? ELINOR Yes , if I can take it . DR . SEELIG You did take it . I saw the care go out of those eyes  --  and the peace come into them . ELINOR Pause . You 're a dear . She gratefully and impulsively takes SEELIG 'S hand . VEDAH May I come in ? DR . SEELIG Yes . VEDAH enters . VEDAH Mama wants you to come up , Elinor . ELINOR Yes  --  As VEDAH starts with her . Oh , I 'll go alone . VEDAH But do n't desert me entirely . ELINOR goes out . DR . SEELIG Mama not coming down ? p. 11 VEDAH No . The BUTLER enters with tea service  --  lighted lamp , etc. , which he puts on the table and goes out . DR . SEELIG When did you first meet Mr. Burrill ? VEDAH With you  --  at his exhibition . DR . SEELIG That was in September . VEDAH Yes . DR . SEELIG Pause . Vedah , I want to help Mr. Burrill  --  VEDAH He has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take down my beautiful vases De Lota gave us . He caresses a vase on one of the pedestals . VEDAH They 're deadly  --  DR . SEELIG And put up Mr. Burrill 's statuettes  --  VEDAH That 's helping ourselves . DR . SEELIG I 'm going to enlist Clayton in Mr. Burrill 's fight with the architects . VEDAH That 's " copy " for Clayton 's . DR . SEELIG But Mr. Burrill is Pause. not a Jew . p. 12 VEDAH Pouring tea . There 's no race nor religion to art , is there ? DR . SEELIG There frequently is to the artist . Tenderly . Careful , my pet . Remember  --  your happiness will be  --  with your own race . VEDAH gives SEELIG his tea . HOLLAND Appears and announces . Mr. Burrill . VEDAH Show Mr. Burrill in . HOLLAND goes . DR . SEELIG Second call this week , is n't it ? VEDAH Yes . DR . SEELIG You know , he has some rights . VEDAH You mean  --  ? DR . SEELIG His heart  --  Enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good afternoon . BURRILL How do you do ? They shake hands . DR . SEELIG How are you ? BURRILL Fine , thank you . DR . SEELIG Any more news of the court house decoration ? p. 13 BURRILL Nothing different . VEDAH How will you take your tea , Mr. Burrill ? BURRILL Submissively . I take it only because I admire its preparation . DR . SEELIG We still struggle along with our vases . He indicates the vases on the pedestals . BURRILL I understand your reluctance to move them . DR . SEELIG Only waiting for your statuettes . BURRILL They have n't come ? DR . SEELIG No . VEDAH I think they did , Papa . Something dreadfully heavy came this morning . DR . SEELIG Well ! VEDAH I was afraid to unpack them . BURRILL Laughing . They 're bronze . VEDAH gives BURRILL his tea . She then goes to the door and pushes the electric button . DR . SEELIG Do you know Clayton  --  the publisher  --  Clayton 's magazine ? BURRILL Reputation . DR . SEELIG He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . The BUTLER enters . VEDAH The expressman brought a package this morning ? BUTLER Yes , M 'm  --  two statues . VEDAH How do you know ? BUTLER I opened it . VEDAH You opened it ! BUTLER Looking to SEELIG . Mrs. Seelig told me to open it . VEDAH Mama told him to open it . Would you have thought it ? DR . SEELIG To BURRILL . How was the box addressed ? BURRILL To you . DR . SEELIG Dryly . I would have thought it  --  yes  --  VEDAH Bring the statuettes here . BUTLER They are in Mrs. Seelig 's room . VEDAH I 'll go with you and get them  --  Excuse me  --  VEDAH and the BUTLER go out . DR . SEELIG I 've asked Clayton to drop in on his way uptown . BURRILL I shall be glad to meet him . p. 15 DR . SEELIG Mrs. Clayton is here . Have you met her ? BURRILL No . DR . SEELIG She was a Miss Hoover . Judge Hoover 's daughter . BURRILL Nodding . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunate , that notoriety . BURRILL Ca n't be agreeable . DR . SEELIG Prosperity tries a man more than poverty does  --  BURRILL So I 've read  --  DR . SEELIG Clayton makes two millions a year from his publications  --  BURRILL Think of it ! DR . SEELIG His temptations were proportionate to his sudden success and  --  well , she is a most sensible woman . BURRILL Forgave everything I believe . DR . SEELIG Not too meekly  --  I assure you  --  but  --  they have a little boy and  --  as I say  --  she is a most sensible woman . As for Clayton  --  well I guess Clayton is sufficiently contrite . VEDAH and the BUTLER re-enter , the BUTLER carries two bronze figurines . p. 16 VEDAH Indicating a pedestal . I think the girl on that pillar  --  And the man on that one  --  DR . SEELIG I 'd put the girl here  --  VEDAH Why ? DR . SEELIG See it first . He takes the female figure from the BUTLER who places the male figure on the floor and goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DR . SEELIG Placing the statuette on the tea table . Your figures are even handsomer here , than at the exhibition . BURRILL The room helps them . DR . SEELIG With the statuette which he displays . Look , Vedah ! Is n't she graceful in every view ? VEDAH She is . DR . SEELIG Do you know your nymph reminds me of those stunning little things by Theodore Riviere ? BURRILL That 's very interesting . The girl that posed for this was a model for Riviere . DR . SEELIG Playfully . Well , there you are  --  I shall set up as a connoisseur . p. 17 VEDAH You promised to bring her photograph . BURRILL I have brought it . DR . SEELIG Half anxiously . But  --  posing ? BURRILL Oh , no  --  street costume . DR . SEELIG Oh  --  BURRILL There  --  He takes a photograph from his pocket and hands it to VEDAH . DR . SEELIG Sitting comfortably . I do n't know why sculpture is so much more modest than photography  --  but  --  it is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does that explain it ? BURRILL Does n't it ? DR . SEELIG I do n't know  --  I 've never been an artist . VEDAH Nor a photographer . DR . SEELIG Nor , for that matter , a beautiful female model . VEDAH Carrying the photograph to SEELIG . See , Papa  --  is n't that face angelic ? DR . SEELIG It is  --  It is  --  To BURRILL . And I dare say the lady herself was  --  Indicates abandon. p. 18 BURRILL No  --  she was n't a bad sort . She has a right to the face . VEDAH With girlish enthusiasm . Those eyes , Papa ! And that beautiful nose and mouth . Why , anybody could love her . BURRILL Well  --  a good many did . VEDAH Of whom does she make you  --  think ? DR . SEELIG Some player . VEDAH Duse . SEELIG nods . BURRILL The resemblance is often remarked . VEDAH She should have been an actress . BURRILL Shaking his head . She tried acting and failed . VEDAH Did you see her ? BURRILL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance in his theater , but  --  she was only a model . DR . SEELIG Yes , if Antoine could n't make her act . VEDAH returns the photograph to BURRILL . BURRILL But  --  a fine girl for all that  --  warm hearted  --  most greatful to the man who had got her the change . VEDAH Well , if anybody got me a place in Antoine 's theater I 'd be grateful . She returns to the statuette examining it closely . I 'm sorry we ca n't see her mouth . p. 19 DR . SEELIG You ca n't Also examines the statuette . BURRILL No  --  our early Greeks played with those pipes tied to the face . VEDAH I 'm going to put her on her pedestal . BURRILL Let me . He takes the statuette from the table . VEDAH Take your old vases , Papa . BURRILL Old vases ! DR . SEELIG Taking the vases from the pedestals . The finest specimens in America , Mr. Burrill . BURRILL Exquisite  --  where did you find them ? DR . SEELIG Benjamin De @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and music for Clayton ! BURRILL Charming . DR . SEELIG I shall promote them to my library . He goes toward the door . I  --  I regard them somewhat as a bribe . BURRILL A bribe ? VEDAH Expostulating . Papa ! DR . SEELIG De Lota gave them to me  --  and in the same interview asked me to  --  to become his father-in-law  --  an intimate and antique relation  --  a time-honored method . Regards vases . Ah , well . SEELIG goes out through the library door. p. 20 BURRILL Dashed with the news . His father-in-law . VEDAH You had n't heard ? BURRILL shakes head , avoiding her gaze . Why , yes . Pause . May I pour you some more tea ? BURRILL No , thank you . He walks away . VEDAH Do you know Mr. De Lota ? BURRILL No . VEDAH He wrote that beautiful notice in Clayton 's about your work . BURRILL Moodily at window . I know his articles , of course . VEDAH Sha n't we put up the dancing man too ? BURRILL Rousing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the second pedestal . VEDAH They go well there , do n't they ? BURRILL Very well . VEDAH Attendant spirits of my fireside . BURRILL They are honored . VEDAH Do you know why I like them ? BURRILL Why ? p. 21 VEDAH Impressively . They are just a girl and a man  --  nothing more  --  with their pan pipes  --  their freedom  --  the joy of existence  --  BURRILL Forcing a gayety . That sounds like paganism . VEDAH I am a pagan . BURRILL And the gentleman ? VEDAH Mr. De Lota ? BURRILL Yes . VEDAH Mr. De Lota  --  is a Jew . BURRILL Pause . Well , I 'm a pagan myself  --  a Walter Pater pagan . VEDAH Oh , yes . I , too , must have the sunshine , the poetry , the festivals . BURRILL And you saw somewhat of that in my little figures ? VEDAH Yes  --  BURRILL You hinted as much that day at the exhibition  --  thousands had walked by and looked at their catalogues  --  but you  --  only you  --  interpreted them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . VEDAH I wonder if you know  --  that we  --  Pause. p. 22 BURRILL We what ? VEDAH Were never introduced to each other . BURRILL I hug that to my memory . VEDAH A friend offered  --  but I fibbed . I said I knew you already . An introduction would have been  --  well  --  Rises impatiently . BURRILL What ? VEDAH A strait-jacket on your dancer . She pauses and comes near him . But it has been wrong to make you call here , has n't it ? BURRILL Has it ? VEDAH Tell me . BURRILL With renewed fervor . Not if they are really to be the attendant spirits . VEDAH Evading his manner and going to the first statuette . Why did you get her a place in Antoine 's theater ? BURRILL I did n't . VEDAH Then how do you know she was grateful ? BURRILL The man who got her the place  --  afterwards committed  --  committed a crime and was on trial in Paris . Mimi had then become a model and was posing for Riviere and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Riviere  --  me  --  everybody  --  to the court house in a frenzied effort to free him . p. 23 VEDAH Maybe she loved him . BURRILL I think not  --  simply gratitude for his interest . But that 's a rare virtue . MRS . ELINOR CLAYTON returns to the room . VEDAH Mrs. Clayton , may I present Mr. Julian Burrill , the sculptor . ELINOR Mr. Burrill . She gives BURRILL her hand . VEDAH Mrs. Clayton is the Mrs. Clayton . ELINOR You must look as though you knew . BURRILL My struggle is to conceal my knowledge  --  ELINOR To VEDAH . All that you 've told me of him seems to be true . BURRILL So quickly ? VEDAH One or two lumps ? And look at my Greek playmates . ELINOR Seeing the statuettes . Charming . To VEDAH . Two please . She turns to the dancing nymph . Think of wanting to vote when one may do that : BURRILL Exactly . VEDAH And cream ? p. 24 ELINOR Lemon please . To BURRILL . You 're a dangerous man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BURRILL That 's a servile portrait . ELINOR Really ? VEDAH Show Mrs. Clayton the photograph . BURRILL Passing the photo to ELINOR . Model . ELINOR I know this woman . VEDAH Resembles Duse . ELINOR In Paris . BURRILL Yes . ELINOR She writes for the papers . BURRILL I hardly think writes for the papers . ELINOR French papers  --  yes . And she represents Mr. Clayton 's publications . BURRILL I should n't have thought it . VEDAH You 've met her ? ELINOR A moment  --  yes  --  in this same hat and gown . She hands the photograph to VEDAH . Mr. Clayton said she spoke no English though she understood it fairly . Frank introduced her as a writer  --  she smiled assent  --  p. 25 BURRILL Reclaiming the photograph . Possible . HOLLAND Entering and announcing . Mr. De Lota . BENJAMIN DE LOTA enters . He is a tall  --  aggressive and intellectual Spanish Jew of thirty-five years or so . HOLLAND goes out . VEDAH Good afternoon . DE LOTA Taking her hand with much manner . Vedah . VEDAH Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . ELINOR nods to him . VEDAH And let me introduce Mr. Burrill . DE LOTA Mr. Burrill . The men shake hands . BURRILL Seriously . I 've an impression of having met you in Paris . DE LOTA I 'm often there . VEDAH Some tea ? DE LOTA Not any , thank you . To ELINOR . I thought Frank was to be here ? ELINOR He is. p. 26 DE LOTA Good . To BURRILL . Doctor Seelig has told Frank  --  Mrs. Clayton 's husband  --  about your now with the architects . BURRILL I hardly call it a row . DE LOTA Better call it a row and make it a row or you 'll never get a chance at the big sculpture . Once let a ring do all the work and you young fellows can starve or be journeymen . Thank God , Clayton 's a Westerner , believes in the open shop . BURRILL We want his influence , but not to involve him . DE LOTA Magazines must print something . He goes to ELINOR . Frank will clasp him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wo n't he ? ELINOR How do you spell steel ? DE LOTA I follow the market . To VEDAH . Where 's Papa ? VEDAH Finding the post of honor in his library for your vases . DE LOTA Noting the pedestals . Oh  --  yours ? BURRILL Yes . DE LOTA Regarding the dancing girl . Charming . ELINOR Does she impress you as a co-worker ? p. 27 DE LOTA Co-worker  --  no  --  co  --  respondent  --  yes . ELINOR I mean as a fellow member of the profession ? DE LOTA Which profession ? ELINOR Journalism . DE LOTA By nothing except the willingness to increase her circulation . VEDAH Mrs. Clayton says the lady represents your magazine in Paris . DE LOTA I dare say I 'm dull  --  but  --  ? BURRILL Not the statuette  --  the model  --  Mimi Chardenet . DE LOTA Mimi Chardenet  --  Europa ? BURRILL Yes . DE LOTA Was Mimi your model ? BURRILL nods . I might have knows it . He turns admiringly to the bronze . ELINOR Why do you say " Europa ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quat'z Arts ball this year . ELINOR Europa  --  mythological , is n't it ? DE LOTA Yes . VEDAH As ELINOR looks to her . I remember something of Europa in our literature class  --  must be all right . p. 28 DE LOTA Disappointingly proper . ELINOR But the lady at the ball ? DE LOTA Costume  --  well , somewhat less than this . ELINOR Less ? DE LOTA Nodding . Without the pipes  --  mounted on a sleek black bull which the students led about the ball room . ELINOR Show Mr. De Lota the photograph . DE LOTA Taking photo from BURRILL . That 's Mimi . ELINOR Let me have it again . DE LOTA gives ELINOR the photograph . BURRILL Can she possibly have also written ? DE LOTA Mimi a blue stocking ? I leave it to you . ELINOR Frank knows this woman . DE LOTA Your husband ? ELINOR Yes . DE LOTA Of course . I introduced him . ELINOR I was sure of it . DE LOTA is startled by ELINOR 'S seriousness . DR . SEELIG Calling from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DR . SEELIG You and Mr. Burrill come here a moment . VEDAH To BURRILL . He wants us  --  To others . He does n't know you are here . DE LOTA Do n't disturb him on my account . VEDAH Your vases anyway  --  I expect  --  BURRILL Excusing his going . Pardon . ELINOR nods . VEDAH and BURRILL go to the library . DE LOTA Alone with ELINOR . Well ? ELINOR Well ? DE LOTA We do meet , do n't we ? ELINOR Vedah did n't tell me you were to be here . DE LOTA The Doctor invited me . ELINOR Meetings of this kind  --  I ca n't help . DE LOTA But you wo n't ask me to your home . ELINOR Frank asks you . DE LOTA I 'll come when you ask me . ELINOR I sha n't ask you . p. 30 DE LOTA Why ? ELINOR Pause . You know why . DE LOTA I do n't . ELINOR Going to the statuette . This model  --  you say you introduced Frank to her ? DE LOTA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELINOR Where ? DE LOTA Paris  --  Quat'z Arts ball . It was her pose as Europa that caught  --  Frank 's  --  caught his eye . ELINOR I remember the newspaper comment the day after . On that particular night  --  Frank went to a meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce . DE LOTA So did I. At those student dances the interesting things do n't begin until midnight . ELINOR I see . DE LOTA Insistently . But you 're changing the subject . Frank and I see a good deal of each other at the office . He begins to think it strange I do n't accept his invitations to the house . ELINOR Why have n't you ? DE LOTA He said he wanted me to call , to know you better  --  Smiles . I saw you 'd told him nothing  --  so  --  I await your invitation . p. 31 ELINOR You were away when Frank and I first met . DE LOTA nods . Away when we married  --  DE LOTA nods . I suppose all husbands ask their wives if they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and goes to the window . DE LOTA Pause . And you said  --  ? ELINOR I said no . Smile if you wish but  --  I had n't loved anyone as I loved him . DE LOTA Following . Naturally . ELINOR So what I said was true . DE LOTA By the feminine standard  --  yes . ELINOR That 's one of the things I always disliked in you , Ben . DE LOTA What ? ELINOR Your talk of feminine standards and masculine standards . In morals there is just one standard . DE LOTA Laughing . Were there many other things you disliked in me ? ELINOR This is one other . DE LOTA What ? ELINOR Your mood of cat-like cruelty . p. 32 DE LOTA Cruelty  --  cat-like ? ELINOR Yes  --  cruelty  --  and it goes with your smile . That is like a cat 's  --  your manner is like a cat 's . When you play the piano it is a cat walking on the keys . DE LOTA There were times , however , when you asked me to play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOTA Elinor  --  He starts impulsively toward her . ELINOR Avoiding him . No  --  DE LOTA Regarding her with admiration . Damn it  --  we 'd have been happy together  --  you and I. ELINOR No . DE LOTA The history of my people supports me . ELINOR Spanish history ? DE LOTA Jewish history . Our girls have often been unhappy when they 've married outside . But our men  --  have absorbed the women of other races . ELINOR You must n't talk to me in that strain . She walks angrily away . DE LOTA A man in sentimental bankruptcy may at least enumerate his assets . We would have been happy . p. 33 ELINOR No . DE LOTA One of us would have been happy , of that  --  I 'm sure . I loved you , Elinor , because you were a queen  --  me you sacrificed because  --  Pause . I was a Jew . ELINOR And because you are a Jew you still speak of it . DE LOTA Exactly . ELINOR But you must cease to speak of it . DE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . I will never be alone with you again . DE LOTA Interposing . Then I must tell you now . ELINOR Commandingly . Play something or I shall leave . DE LOTA Thank you  --  I prefer this way myself . He laughs and goes to the piano which he plays brilliantly and with passion . SEELIG , VEDAH and BURRILL re-enter in turn and join ELINOR Enter HOLLAND who whispers to SEELIG . SEELIG goes out with HOLLAND and returns with CLAYTON as piano ceases . p. 34 VEDAH Meeting CLAYTON and shaking his hand . We feared you were forgetting us . FRANK Never  --  He nods to his wife. my dear . VEDAH Mr. Clayton , may I present Mr. Julian Burrill . FRANK To BURRILL . I thought you an older man . VEDAH He is . BURRILL laughs . FRANK In the Salon six years ago , were n't you ? BURRILL Yes . FRANK Medal , if I remember ? BURRILL nods . CLAYTON turns to SEELIG with a shrug . DR . SEELIG No justice at all in the discrimination of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest work . She indicates the dancing figurine . FRANK Charming . ELINOR Do you recognize the lady ? FRANK Playfully . I 'd like to . p. 35 ELINOR Mimi Chardenet . FRANK Chardenet ? ELINOR You must remember  --  rode the black bull at the Quat'z Arts ball . A swift glance passes between DE LOTA and CLAYTON . FRANK Ah , indeed . To BURRILL . From that celebrated model . BURRILL nods . ELINOR To BURRILL . Let Mr. Clayton see the photograph . BURRILL I ca n't think it would interest him . CLAYTON tries to engage SEELIG in conversation . ELINOR Oh , yes . To CLAYTON . Frank ! CLAYTON turns to her . Look at this photograph  --  please . To BURRILL . BURRILL Reluctantly yielding the photograph . Miss Seelig had some curiosity about it . FRANK Oh , yes . ELINOR Mr. Burrill was inclined to doubt that the lady represented your magazines . FRANK Evasively . Oh , that arrangement was never completed  --  discussed but  --  He returns the photograph to BURRILL. p. 36 DE LOTA Trying to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . ELINOR Regarding the bronze . So it appears . DE LOTA I mean she could think . Antoine told me that she caught the meaning of a line  --  as quickly as any woman that ever came into his theater . VEDAH Starting at the name . Antoine ? DE LOTA Yes , Antoine the manager . I got her a place in his company . VEDAH When was that ? DE LOTA Oh , nine or ten years ago before she posed professionally . VEDAH looks to BURRILL who avoids her inquiry . FRANK She said she would write of the theater . ELINOR Well  --  I must go . VEDAH Really ? Am I to be the only woman in this council of war ? ELINOR Leave it all to the men , my dear . FRANK The car 's at the door  --  take it if you wish . ELINOR Frigidly . I 'll walk , thank you . Pause . Mr. Burrill , I 'm very glad to have seen you . p. 37 BURRILL Thank you . ELINOR And your model  --  well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DE LOTA turns to her . As you also know the lady , Mr. De Lota  --  you shall tell me more of her . I hope you 'll call on us . She gives DE LOTA her hand . DE LOTA I 've been promising Mr. Clayton to do so . ELINOR You must  --  Going with VEDAH to the hall  --  You 'll bring Mr. Burrill to see me too ? VEDAH Delighted , Mrs. Clayton . VEDAH and ELINOR go out . DE LOTA I put my foot in it  --  but  --  hang it , I was completely off guard . Mrs. Clayton said " Why Frank knows this woman " and I blurted " of course  --  I introduced him . " Turns to BURRILL for confirmation . FRANK Forget it . DR . SEELIG Trouble ? FRANK En promenade with the girl  --  Elinor met us . I said business . DR . SEELIG Seriously . ' Mmm . Too bad after  --  the  --  the other trouble so soon . p. 38 FRANK Damn it  --  a man ca n't go to Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know the world I live in . I publish three magazines and a metropolitan newspaper . DR . SEELIG The wife met you walking with the woman ? FRANK That 's all  --  To DE LOTA with some anxiety . You told her nothing more ?

SEELIG Suppose we go into the library  --  I 've your papers there , Mr. Burrill . FRANK Yes . The men start to the library . VEDAH Mr. Burrill ! I 'll send Mr. Burrill immediately . BURRILL To SEELIG . You permit me ? SEELIG pauses , regards VEDAH intently . DE LOTA , CLAYTON and SEELIG go out . p. 39 VEDAH In sudden alarm . He is the man  --  I saw your face when he said he had introduced this girl to Antoine . BURRILL Antoine 's name startled me  --  that was all  --  and  --  VEDAH You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did  --  many times . VEDAH You think you saw him in that court room  --  on trial for a crime . BURRILL Evasively . No  --  no . VEDAH The man on trial had spoken to Antoine for the girl . BURRILL A dozen men may have done that . Engagements in the theater require many introductions . VEDAH I read the doubt in your heart . You 're not the conventional coward that most men are  --  tell me . I am promised to marry Benjamin De Lota  --  does n't that mean anything to you ? BURRILL Mean anything !  --  He starts impulsively toward VEDAH , stops and after a moment 's effort at self-control says calmly and tenderly . I love you ! VEDAH inhales quickly , her glance falls before BURRILL 'S look , she turns irresolutely toward the room into which DE LOTA has gone  --  a pause. @x SCENE : Lounging room of MR .

DE LOTA enters from the dining room waving a lace handkerchief playfully . DE LOTA Found ! Lady 's handkerchief  --  no marks . MRS . SEELIG Extending her hand . Thank you . DE LOTA Withholding the handkerchief . On one consideration . To ELINOR . Mrs. Seelig says the talking machine has spoiled  --  Celeste Ada  --  for her ears  --  To MRS . SEELIG .

Hands libretto to DE LOTA . VEDAH Going out with ELINOR . Papa will probably be here before you get away . ELINOR goes upstairs talking with VEDAH . They disappear . p. 46 BURRILL As DE LOTA starts to music room . Mr. De Lota  --  were you in Paris eight years ago ? DE LOTA Returning . Yes  --  and twenty-eight years ago  --  I 'm there every year . BURRILL Did you ever  --  visit the Cour d'Assizes ? DE LOTA Occasionally  --  if some interesting case were on  --  BURRILL I remember one very interesting case  --  A husband punished his wife  --  and also her lover  --  by imprisonment . DE LOTA The French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentenced to a year 's imprisonment . DE LOTA He was fortunate  --  the court in its discretion might have given him two years . BURRILL You are more minutely informed on the subject than the average American . DE LOTA I am more minutely informed on most subjects that the average American . I know somewhat of character  --  of men 's temperaments and motives , Mr. Burrill . And your interest in my life at Paris is very serviceable just now . BURRILL Indeed ! p. 47 DE LOTA Indeed yes . I 've been at a loss to understand the change in Miss Seelig 's deportment toward myself . I was charging it to your superior attraction . I see it was due to your power of insinuation . BURRILL I have insinuated nothing about you . DE LOTA You have been direct ? BURRILL I 've avoided discussing your life in Paris . DE LOTA That is wise , Mr. Burrill . In fact , you could do only one thing that would be more wise . BURRILL Yes ? DE LOTA Avoid discussing any of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DE LOTA Thank you ! He turns away . BURRILL Following . Except with one person . DE LOTA You mean  --  the lady ? BURRILL I mean you . I expect to discuss them with you rather frankly . DE LOTA I shall be pleased . He throws the libretto on the table and confronts BURRILL . ELINOR Entering . Ready , Mr. De Lota ? p. 48 DE LOTA Smiling . You excuse me ? BURRILL nods . DE LOTA disappears in the hallway . ELINOR I wish you were going with us . BURRILL I wish I were . CLAYTON re-enters from the music room . ELINOR You 'll see Dick , wo n't you ? FRANK Yes . ELINOR He 's not started to undress yet .

CLAYTON offers to kiss her . No . FRANK Still cross patch ? ELINOR We ca n't laugh it off , Frank . FRANK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't tread my sensibilities into the mire by your affairs with other women and expect me to smile at cue . FRANK Women !  --  One girl  --  and a man 's natural curiosity about her type . Hang it  --  there must be some freedom . p. 49 ELINOR Do you suggest more than you 've had ? FRANK I suggest domestic peace  --  or any other punishment than this deadly sulking . ELINOR You 've admitted you went to the woman 's room . FRANK Admitted nothing . I candidly told you I had gone there  --  told you in order that you might know all . ELINOR All that you were willing to tell . FRANK I ca n't keep pace with your imagination . ELINOR Your wish to have me " know all " is six months after the fact and when her photograph accidentally exposed you ! FRANK If you 're kicking on the tardiness of your news service , I 'm with you . ELINOR I 'm resenting your breach of faith . FRANK Do n't assume any covenant , my dear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promises after the affair of two years ago ? FRANK I did n't promise to stagnate . I 'm a publisher with a newsman 's curiosity about the world he lives in . ELINOR And what of a woman 's curiosity ? FRANK Colossal ! But not privileged . Curiosity of that kind in a woman is idle and immoral ! p. 50 ELINOR And in a man ? FRANK A man 's on the firing line  --  a woman 's in the commissariat . ELINOR Which is a fine way of saying you have a license for transgression that your wife has not . FRANK If you will  --  yes . ELINOR After a defiant pause . You 're mistaken . DE LOTA enters in wrap and carrying his hat . DE LOTA Ready ? ELINOR Yes . To CLAYTON . You 'll go up to Dick occasionally ? FRANK Certainly . ELINOR Calls .

SEELIG What is a father for  --  with his magazines and newspapers  --  if he ca n't carry a little boy upstairs , eh ? Goes with MISS DOANE after CLAYTON who carries DICK upstairs . VEDAH Looks sick , does n't he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wants his mother . If Papa says he 's ill I can go to Mrs. Clayton 's box and let her know . BURRILL Yes . VEDAH Have you noticed the disposition of our two parties ? BURRILL Disposition ? VEDAH Mr. De Lota escorts Mrs. Clayton . BURRILL Mr. Clayton does n't care for the opera . VEDAH Some of my friends have been good enough to comment on the frequency of Mr. De Lota 's calls . BURRILL Pause . Do you care ? VEDAH A woman 's natural  --  pride . BURRILL But  --  heartaches ? VEDAH shakes head . Does Mrs. Clayton know of your engagement ? VEDAH No . Pause . Have you done what I asked you ? BURRILL What ? VEDAH A letter to Paris . BURRILL There 's none to whom I could write  --  on such a subject . VEDAH Your model friend  --  she is still there ? p. 54 BURRILL I suppose so . VEDAH Why not a line to her ? BURRILL Evasively . She owes me nothing . VEDAH Well  --  ? BURRILL She 'd probably take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VEDAH Why " forward "  --  has he left the country ? BURRILL Quickly recovering . Probably  --  or perhaps not  --  but  --  either way  --  nothing accomplished . VEDAH Either way nothing lost . Wo n't you try ? BURRILL Disturbed . It is n't a manly thing to do  --  even against a rival . VEDAH Smiling . Thank you . BURRILL Why ? VEDAH Rival . BURRILL Well ? VEDAH So far you 've said only that you loved me . BURRILL You do n't resent  --  rival ? VEDAH Does any woman ? BURRILL With quick look about . You know , if there were n't so many doors here  --  Approaches her. p. 55 VEDAH Retreating .

VEDAH Resuming the interrupted talk with BURRILL . But write to that girl . BURRILL Smiling . I did say I loved you . VEDAH A month ago . BURRILL Yes . VEDAH And now ? BURRILL There is n't any stronger word or I 'd use it . VEDAH Seriously . It is n't a thing a man says to a girl  --  betrothed to another man  --  is it ? BURRILL Not generally . VEDAH That is another proof that you recognize Mr. De Lota as that man of the court room . You must  --  do something . BURRILL Easily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're engaged  --  are n't we  --  he and I ? p. 57 BURRILL I 've said I love you . VEDAH Yes . BURRILL And you 've listened to it  --  because  --  you love me . VEDAH Pause . Well ? BURRILL Shaking head . Not Mr. De Lota . I shall marry you  --  so what difference does it make what he did in Paris ? VEDAH I know my father . Mr. De Lota is of our faith , there would have to be good reason for breaking with him now . CLAYTON comes downstairs with MRS . SEELIG . BURRILL Breaking the engagement  --  would mean no distress to you ? VEDAH In half coquetry . Why have I listened to you ? Enter MRS .

FRANK He 's at the head of the hospital for crippled children but great in diagnosis  --  medicine  --  anything . BURRILL Heidelberg , Miss Vedah tells me . FRANK Getting a cigar . Postgraduate yes  --  but New York family . Father left him ten millions . BURRILL Might have struggled through with that . p. 59 FRANK His heart makes him a doctor . If ever I go to Heaven and that old Jew is n't there I 'll ask for a rain check . BURRILL Lights cigarette . I understand they receive Jews . FRANK Heaven ? BURRILL nods .

Well  --  I 'll leave this envelope for them  --  they may care to see it when they come in . Seeing SEELIG . How 's the boy , Doctor ? DR . SEELIG Quite ill  --  poor baby . BURRILL Too bad  --  To SUTTON . I 'll speak with the Doctor a moment . SUTTON bows  --  and goes out . BURRILL You have a minute or two ? DR . SEELIG Still seated at ' phone table . I 've sent for some medicine  --  and am free until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thank you , Doctor , for your interest in my work . DR . SEELIG It 's been a pleasure , Mr. Burrill . BURRILL It 's been a lesson to me . DR . SEELIG Lesson ? BURRILL Nodding . I 'm reprehensively ignorant on most subjects , especially religion and  --  well  --  your interest in sculpture  --  your toleration of it surprised me . DR . SEELIG Why ? BURRILL I 'd always thought there was something in your tenets that forbade any graven image . DR . SEELIG Only as objects of idolatry I think . The words are : " Nor bow down and worship them . " As works of art I do n't know any prohibition . My dear old father was a very orthodox believer  --  closed his office on Saturday and all that  --  but he was a liberal patron of the arts . In fact , I do n't know a Jew among a fairly extensive circle  --  that feels as you  --  as you feared , Mr. Burrill . BURRILL You are not so orthodox as your father then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got a contrary impression . p. 73 DR . SEELIG From Judge Hoover ? BURRILL From Miss Vedah . DR . SEELIG Vedah ? BURRILL Yes . It is of her I wish to speak . DR . SEELIG Ah ! BURRILL I would n't speak of her  --  if  --  if I did n't think a mistake was being made , Dr. Seelig . DR . SEELIG A mistake ! BURRILL Yes  --  I mean that my own feelings are not my sole guide . I think that Miss Vedah  --  likes me . DR . SEELIG I 'm glad you see it . I have cautioned her myself  --  and now perhaps you will aid me . BURRILL I speak to you about it as a matter of honor . You  --  you 've been so ready to invite me to your house and all that  --  and  --  DR . SEELIG And to tell you early of Vedah 's engagement ? BURRILL Yes  --  so my duty is to be a trifle old fashioned , if you will , and to tell you that  --  I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can . DR . SEELIG Her regard ? Only that ? BURRILL I 've no right to speak for her  --  so  --  p. 74 DR . SEELIG Has Vedah said more ? BURRILL I 've said more . She knows that I love her . DR . SEELIG You told her so ? BURRILL Yes . DR . SEELIG Then this caution to me is somewhat late , is n't it ? BURRILL But unavoidably . If I did n't think she cared more for me than for  --  the man to whom she 's engaged , I do n't think I 'd have spoken . DR . SEELIG You mean to me ? BURRILL To either of you . DR . SEELIG Why not first to me ? BURRILL Until I was sure there was no need to distress you , as I felt you would be , as I feel you are . Walks away as having said all that is possible . DR . SEELIG Pause , slowly rises and approaches BURRILL . In asking your patient understanding , Mr. Burrill  --  I am fortunate that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DR . SEELIG Most sculptors think in large symbols . The little span of human life takes its true proportion . p. 75 BURRILL This life is all I 'm sure of . I fear its rather important to me . DR . SEELIG It 's all any of us is sure of . Pause . I 'm not a religionist , Mr. Burrill  --  but  --  Pause . It has been wisely written , " Of all factors that make races and individuals what they are the most potent is religion . " It would be a very sorry world without it . BURRILL There can be more than one religion , however , ca n't there ? DR . SEELIG There should be . Even to grind corn there must be two millstones . And for the world to grow in religion there must be more than one idea . Pause . The belief in one God is the trust given to the Jew  --  the precious idea of which every Jewish woman is custodian and which to transmit  --  the Jew suffers and persists . You see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . BURRILL Yes . DR . SEELIG The Christian faith itself needs our testimony . It is built upon our foundation  --  and whenever a daughter quits us the religious welfare of the whole world is the loser . BURRILL I do n't see that . DR . SEELIG Pardon the pride , which our proverb says " Goes often before a fall " and let me call your recollection to the nobility of this trust which a Jewish girl abandons if she marries elsewhere . BURRILL nods . A pause . When Egypt worshiped Isis and Osiris and Thoth , Israel proclaimed the one God . When India knelt to Vishnu and Siva and Kali , Israel prayed only to Jehovah and down past Greece and Rome , with their numerous divinities from Jove to Saturn , Judah looked up to one God . What a legacy  --  what a birthright ! How small our personal desires grow in comparison . As a sculptor , who writes in bronze that all time may read , what message can you leave if one so grand as this fails of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DR . SEELIG I was sure of it . Is it too much to ask that a girl shall have time to think of this ? BURRILL No , sir ! I shall say nothing to her more than I have said , which is I love her and I know she loves me . SEELIG bows slowly , BURRILL respectfully acknowledges the bow . ELINOR enters excitedly , sees BURRILL and SEELIG and quickly passes to the music room . HOOVER comes in . HOOVER Nervously . Mr. Burrill  --  you will have to excuse Mr. and Mrs. Clayton tonight ? BURRILL I know  --  good night . Goes quickly out . HOOVER turns helplessly toward SEELIG , who with a gesture of comprehension , goes upstairs . As SEELIG goes , ELINOR enters by the other arch . ELINOR Do n't leave me , father . She walks excitedly . HOOVER I wo n't . But I 'm not only your father  --  I 'm your attorney  --  a counsellor . Let me have the truth , Elinor . The door was locked ? ELINOR Sitting . De @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to open it when Frank came . p. 77 HOOVER But why there at all ? Why in De Lota 's rooms ? ELINOR Just plain madness . Twice at dinner the conversation got onto Mr. Burrill 's sculpture . Frank has had an affair with Burrill 's model . Rises and walks ; throws her cloak onto the table . HOOVER When ? Not since the trouble of Atlantic City ? ELINOR This year in Paris  --  I 've made him almost admit it . De Lota introduced them . Tonight when we found the Underwoods could n't go  --  and we were alone for the evening , De Lota and I  --  he proposed seeing some Japanese carvings he has in his rooms . HOOVER But , Elinor  --  you 're not an infant . A proposal of that kind is only a mask for lawlessness . ELINOR I am lawless . He claims the right to follow his fancy and does follow it  --  my right is equal . He introduced me to this very woman on the Boulevard  --  but I did n't strike her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELINOR Like a cheap bully . The front door is slammed violently . CLAYTON enters , pale with excitement . FRANK You came here , did you ? p. 78 ELINOR Why should n't I ? You have n't made it such a sanctified temple that I 'm unworthy to enter it . FRANK To HOOVER . She ca n't stay . HOOVER Going to CLAYTON . See here , Frank . You 're in no state of mind to make any important decision . FRANK The facts make the decision  --  HOOVER You have n't got the facts ? FRANK I 've got all I can stand and we wo n't vulgarly discuss them . I decline to live with an adulteress . ELINOR I 'm not that  --  but I am an indignant and cruelly neglected woman . FRANK She 's your daughter . Now take her from my house or  --  I 'll have the servants do it ! Strides into the music room . ELINOR Impetuously . Coward ! His house  --  HOOVER Elinor  --  that 's not the way . ELINOR I have n't worked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consulted and agreed upon . His house ! You know that every investment  --  HOOVER He does n't mean it . He 's excited beyond control  --  any husband would be . p. 79 ELINOR In every tight place it was your legal advice that  --  HOOVER We ca n't go into that now , my dear . Humor him  --  avoid a scene before the servants . I 'll take you to a hotel and  --  ELINOR Hotel ! The cruelty of it  --  turned like a common woman onto the street . Sinks overwhelmed into a chair . HOOVER Only a day or two . If things were only as you say at De Lota 's we can get Frank to believe us  --  ELINOR After what I 've forgiven him ! Oh , dad  --  HOOVER Do n't  --  do n't ! Change your gown and we 'll go . Tomorrow will put another color on everything . Helps her up and leads her protesting toward the hall . ELINOR Resentfully . The injustice of it  --  ! The cruelty  --  ! The  --  SEELIG comes downstairs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SEELIG Pardon  --  HOOVER Trying to pass . Mrs. Clayton is n't well . SEELIG enters . DR . SEELIG Taking ELINOR 'S hand . I see  --  but come from the hall . Dick will hear you . p. 80 ELINOR Dick ? DR . SEELIG Yes . ELINOR Dick 's ill  --  ? I 'll go to him . DR . SEELIG Restraining ELINOR . One moment  --  To HOOVER . You go to him . HOOVER The situation here , Doctor  --  DR . SEELIG I think , Judge Hoover , I comprehend the situation here , please go . HOOVER goes upstairs . ELINOR As SEELIG brings her further into the room . I ca n't leave without seeing my boy . DR . SEELIG Leave ! Slowly . No  --  no  --  but you must be calm when you go to him . There must be no excitement whatever . ELINOR Hysterically . I ca n't be calm and go away from him  --  if he 's ill . You know the boy , Doctor . How much we are to each other  --  all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SEELIG I know . ELINOR It 's too much to bear  --  Falls weeping into the chair at fireplace . CLAYTON enters p. 81 FRANK With suppression . If there 's any man , Doctor , your people should have run straight with  --  I 'm the man . DR . SEELIG My people ? FRANK Pointing to ELINOR . Locked in Ben De Lota 's rooms . DR . SEELIG My people ! Pause . A Jew ! FRANK Vehemently . A Jew . DR . SEELIG Pause . There was another Jew  --  if one of His people may quote Him  --  Puts hand on ELINOR 'S head . " Are you to cast the first stone ? " FRANK I 'm no hypocrite  --  I never subscribed to his code  --  and I 'll not begin the living hell  --  of life with a dishonored woman . ELINOR Rising defiantly . I 'm not dishonored . I only claim the right you exercise for yourself to go where life interests me . If it 's honorable and moral for you  --  it 's equally honorable and equally moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have fully earned by your visit to Ben De Lota 's room . I 'm going to make your equality complete . From now on , you 'll protect yourself and you 'll earn the substance your vanity squanders. p. 82 ELINOR Ah !  --  DR . SEELIG Interrupting ELINOR 'S outburst . One moment  --  do n't speak , my child . Pause . Calms ELINOR to her chair . Your difference must wait . Just now Mrs. Clayton must be composed . FRANK Explosively . We 're past the consideration of her nerves . Just now Mrs. Clayton must take what she needs for the night and leave  --  her trunks will follow her . Goes to the push button and rings . DR . SEELIG In masterful calm . No Frank  --  she shall not leave . FRANK She 'll not  --  DR . SEELIG She shall not . FRANK Angrily . What have you got to do with it ? DR . SEELIG Every thing ! There 's a little boy upstairs  --  no one shall move him until I give permission , and his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gave it him . Enter SUTTON . FRANK Pause . SUTTON  --  Pause  --  SEELIG looks sharply and steadily at CLAYTON. pack my valise  --  and send it to the Club . p. 83 SUTTON Yes , sir . Goes out . FRANK Leaving the room . Good night , Doctor Seelig . DR . SEELIG Quietly . Good night . ELINOR still seated turns weeping to SEELIG who embraces her paternally. @x SCENE : Library in house of DOCTOR SEELIG . Door at back lets into Drawing Room which formed the first act .

VEDAH Together after all the talk and tears and family councils . p. 85 BURRILL Have there been tears ? VEDAH Nodding . Some . BURRILL You poor dear . VEDAH I 've tried so hard not to care for you . BURRILL Have you ? They sit together on the sofa . VEDAH Yes . Read the persecutions of my ancestry and blamed it all on yours and then said , with Mercutio , " A plague on both your houses . " BURRILL I hope you are as incurably smitten as Mercutio was when he said that . VEDAH I think I must be . Was n't there something about a church door ? BURRILL You angel ! VEDAH Our critics write that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? VEDAH And I fear it 's true . I have a great envie to have the noted American sculptor in our box and all the opera glasses saying , " Vedah Seelig ! She 's caught him at last . " BURRILL Have you manuvred greatly ? VEDAH Shamelessly  --  not even introduced to you . BURRILL I know it  --  but we 've met , have n't we ? Kisses her. p. 86 VEDAH Resisting tardily . That is n't being done , you know , until the engagement is announced . BURRILL How does one tell ? VEDAH I suppose  --  one does n't tell ? BURRILL What have you been doing since I saw you ? VEDAH Home mostly . You know Mrs. Clayton is visiting us ? BURRILL Mrs. Clayton ? VEDAH And little Dick . He has the room that was my nursery . I 've spent a lot of time with Dick .

SEELIG Vedah 's our only child , Mr. Burrill , and my first wish is to see her happy  --  but  --  p. 89 VEDAH Mama means that any unhappiness of mine would n't matter if she had another daughter . MRS . SEELIG Mr. Burrill understands me , I 'm sure . BURRILL I do , Mrs. Seelig . MRS . SEELIG But Doctor and I agree that Vedah should think calmly . VEDAH That 's expecting a good deal . MRS . SEELIG The Doctor is  --  going to  --  well , not let you see so much of each other , and I want to prepare you , Mr. Burrill , for his talk with you . Enter HOLLAND . HOLLAND Mr. De Lota and Judge Hoover . MRS . SEELIG Judge Hoover ! Excuse me . Follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

SEELIG goes into the drawing room closing the door after her . ELINOR You two come  --  here together . HOOVER I brought Mr. De Lota  --  yes . p. 91 ELINOR Why ? HOOVER Sit down , my dear . It 's going to take more than a minute . ELINOR sits . And you  --  DE LOTA. sits . When have you heard from Frank ? ELINOR Anxiously rising . Do n't they know where he is ? HOOVER Good Heavens , Elinor  --  do n't answer my question by asking another . ELINOR But do n't they ? HOOVER Do n't who know where he is ? ELINOR Anybody . HOOVER Hundreds I suppose  --  but have you heard from him ? ELINOR No . HOOVER Does n't he ask after little Dick ? ELINOR He ' phones Doctor Seelig every day . HOOVER But you ? ELINOR No . Pause . HOOVER Frank has instructed Colonel Emory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ELINOR Oh ! p. 92 HOOVER You expected it , did n't you ? ELINOR Not after his conduct with this second woman  --  this sculptor model in Paris . HOOVER That was n't condoned , eh ? ELINOR Not after I discovered it . HOOVER What  --  what proof have you of that affair ? ELINOR He admitted it . HOOVER Quickly . He did ? ELINOR Almost . HOOVER I fear " almost " wo n't go in court . ELINOR And  --  Mr. De Lota knows it . He told me so . DE LOTA As HOOVER turns to him . My opinion . HOOVER You told Mrs. Clayton that , did you ? DE LOTA My opinion  --  yes . HOOVER Have you and she met since  --  Clayton and I  --  came to your hotel ? DE LOTA No . HOOVER Communicated ? DE LOTA shakes head . Oh  --  then you told her  --  this opinion of yours with an idea of its influence upon her ? p. 93 DE LOTA I answered her questions . HOOVER And a damn fine mess you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd better get to the purpose of our call . HOOVER Perhaps . To ELINOR . I do n't need to tell you , Elinor , that this thing 's awkward for me . ELINOR I know . HOOVER The other side can subpna me  --  and my testimony ca n't help you  --  Pause . If we go about it rightly , however , Colonel Emory thinks Frank can be persuaded to let you get the decree . ELINOR No . HOOVER No ? ELINOR The reason for not getting a divorce two years ago is much greater now . HOOVER You mean  --  ? ELINOR I mean Dick . HOOVER It 's better for Dick to have the blame fixed on his father than upon you . ELINOR I 'm not guilty . HOOVER My dear Elinor , I 'm your father  --  and  --  and I believe you  --  but Pause . I 'm an attorney and I have been a Judge . The case is against you . p. 94 ELINOR To De Lota . You know I 'm not a guilty woman . DE LOTA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must face the situation as it is .

Do n't  --  do n't do that . It is n't what any of us hoped for some years ago  --  but it 's a devilish sight better , my dear , than it all looked last month . ELINOR There ca n't be such injustice in the world  --  that he may go unscathed and little Dick and I  --  no  --  no  --  I ca n't live and have it come to that . I wo n't consent to any such arrangement of it all . HOOVER It 's little Dick I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all I am thinking of . He 's like his father  --  it 's his father 's name he 'll carry through his life and I 'm not going even to propose to blacken it . HOOVER What are you going to do ? ELINOR Defend myself  --  defend my boy 's mother . HOOVER Against the boy 's father ? ELINOR Yes . HOOVER And if the court gives Clayton a decree of divorce ? ELINOR Then I shall live  --  live so that he 'll see some day he was mistaken . HOOVER There 's one point we must n't overlook . Dick 's how old ? ELINOR He 's seven . HOOVER The court may award his custody to Clayton . ELINOR Greatly agitated . Oh no ! Father ! They wo n't  --  they ca n't do that . HOOVER I do n't know .

If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to take the boy . p. 96 ELINOR Divorce ! DE LOTA And no certainty it can be kept quiet . ELINOR You mean the papers ? DE LOTA Yes . If Mr. Clayton lets you get the decree  --  only the Chardenet girl will be named . ELINOR rings push button by fireplace . HOOVER What are you doing ? ELINOR Tell Mrs. Seelig  --  DE LOTA No  --  no  --  HOOVER Why ? ELINOR Because Doctor Seelig has told her nothing . Enter HOLLAND . HOOVER One minute . HOLLAND Going . Yes , sir . ELINOR Holland  --  ask Mrs. Seelig to come here . HOLLAND goes . HOOVER Wait till Frank decides . ELINOR I 've decided . HOOVER But you may reconsider . DE LOTA Yes  --  why tell her now ? ELINOR She has a right to know . p. 97 HOOVER What right ? ELINOR A wife 's right  --  a mother 's right . The right of a woman who has taken an outcast into her home . HOOVER You were not an outcast , Elinor  --  you could have come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gone to a hotel . DE LOTA I beg of you , Elinor  --  wait  --  or at least do n't tell everything . My position in this house is  --  peculiar . HOOVER Your position ? DE LOTA Yes  --  a tacit engagement to  --  Vedah . ELINOR Oh ! How vile it all makes me . DE LOTA The more reason to be careful . Enter MRS . SEELIG . MRS . SEELIG My dear ? HOOVER Cautioning . Elinor ! MRS . SEELIG What is it ? Starts to ELINOR . ELINOR Wait  --  Pause.  --  until I tell you  --  Pause.  --  doctor told you only that it would be good for Dick to come here ? Nothing more ? p. 98 MRS . SEELIG Nothing . ELINOR Not  --  my trouble  --  with Frank ? MRS . SEELIG No  --  and do n't you tell it , my dear , if it agitates you . Besides , Frank has lots to worry him . We must n't judge too quickly . ELINOR He wants a divorce . MRS . SEELIG He does ? ELINOR Nodding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  father has just told me . MRS . SEELIG Because Looks at HOOVER who nods toward DE LOTA . Frank 's jealous  --  of Benjamin ? To ELINOR . ELINOR I had no idea Vedah was engaged to him . Oh , it 's too  --  too horrible . MRS . SEELIG What ideas men can get in their heads . ELINOR No , I 'm to blame , Mrs. Seelig . I deserve it all  --  I did go to his rooms  --  the Doctor knows . MRS . SEELIG Your rooms  --  DE LOTA nods . Together ? DE LOTA Yes . MRS . SEELIG But , my dear Elinor  --  p. 99 ELINOR The Doctor believes me  --  I was crazy  --  rebellious  --  vengeful  --  striking back  --  bitterly resentful of deceit Frank had been newly guilty of . I went as much in the name of all women despitefully treated as I did in assertion of my own freedom . And then  --  I came to my senses . I 'm not guilty or I would n't be in your home  --  MRS . SEELIG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SEELIG . MRS . SEELIG Quietly . She 's just told me . DR . SEELIG To HOOVER . Col. Emery called on me this afternoon . HOOVER Then you know ? DR . SEELIG Yes . HOOVER Naturally somewhat of a shock . Indicates ELINOR . DR . SEELIG Yes . HOOVER We have n't any right to expect less from Clayton . ELINOR No right ? Did I divorce him two years ago when he was guilty  --  really guilty ? Did I ? HOOVER No ! You made a scene with the woman and got a rotten lot of newspaper notoriety  --  but the offense you condoned . p. 100 MRS . SEELIG And a man that 's been forgiven all that should n't talk about divorce if his poor wife loses her head for a minute . It 's unbearable the privileges these men claim  --  and the double standard of morality they set up . DR . SEELIG These men ? MRS . SEELIG All of them . And that woman dramatist with her play was right . It is " a man 's world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my dear . ELINOR You think I should , be made to suffer ? DR . SEELIG I think you do suffer . ELINOR That my offense is less forgivable than Frank 's was ? DR . SEELIG Pause . You have my pity , Elinor , and shall have my help but I ca n't lie to you . ELINOR That I 'm more guilty than he ? MRS . SEELIG Pause . Do n't ask that of a Jew , my dear  --  however liberal in his religion he pretends to be . My father was an orthodox Rabbi  --  I know . DR . SEELIG What do you know ? MRS . SEELIG Our ancient law  --  from which all your ideas come . A man 's past was his own . He was not forbidden as many wives as he wanted , but if a poor girl had made a mistake and concealed it from these lords of creation , she was stoned to death unless she was the daughter of a priest  --  in which case she was to be burnt alive . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SEELIG Elinor . Pause . Do you hear that rattle of the railroad ? ELINOR Yes . DR . SEELIG All over this great land thousands of trains run every day starting and arriving in punctual agreement because this is a woman 's world . The great steamships , dependable almost as the sun  --  a million factories in civilization  --  the countless looms and lathes of industry  --  the legions of labor that weave the riches of the world  --  all  --  all move by the mainspring of man 's faith in woman  --  man 's faith . ELINOR I want him to have faith in me . DR . SEELIG This old world hangs together by love . MRS . SEELIG Not man 's love for woman . DR . SEELIG No  --  nor woman 's love for man , but by the love of both  --  for the children . ELINOR Dick ! DR . SEELIG Men work for the children because they believe the children are  --  their own  --  believe . Every mother knows she is the mother of her son or daughter . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake that knowledge . Every father believes he is a father only by his faith in the woman . Let him be however virtuous , no power on earth can strengthen in him a conviction greater than that faith . There is a double standard of morality because upon the golden basis of woman 's virtue rests the welfare of the world . p. 102 ELINOR Have I  --  lost everything ? DR . SEELIG Frank must be convinced of your love and your loyalty . ELINOR I do love him . DR . SEELIG Of course . To DE LOTA . Why are you here ? DE LOTA To  --  do anything that is in my power  --  to assure Mrs. Clayton that she will have my protection if  --  it comes to the worst . DR . SEELIG Well  --  that 's where it would be . DE LOTA And there must be some things you want to say to me ? DR . SEELIG There are . HOOVER To SEELIG . Clayton 's always had great respect for your opinion , Dr. Seelig . DR . SEELIG I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SEELIG . You ' phoned me that Mr. Burrill  --  MRS . SEELIG He 's there . Indicates living room . DR . SEELIG Have you seen your grandson , Judge Hoover ? HOOVER No . ELINOR You must  --  Dick 's asked for you  --  Rises . Come . p. 103 DR . SEELIG On your way out I 'll see you again . HOOVER and ELINOR go out . DR . SEELIG To MRS . SEELIG . You entertain Mr. Burrill a moment . MRS . SEELIG He does n't lack entertainment . DR . SEELIG What ? MRS . SEELIG Vedah 's with him . DR . SEELIG Starting to door . I thought we 'd agreed about that ? MRS . SEELIG Does n't this trouble make a difference ? DR . SEELIG It ca n't affect our decision concerning Burrill . MRS . SEELIG Not before Vedah . SEELIG goes to living room . DE LOTA Perhaps the trouble can be fixed , Mrs. Seelig  --  if the doctor talks to Clayton . MRS . SEELIG It ca n't be " fixed " as you call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell Vedah ? MRS . SEELIG I wo n't have to tell Vedah , she loves this artist . DE LOTA But to marry a Christian ! MRS . SEELIG When she might have you . p. 104 DE LOTA It 's taught me something . MRS . SEELIG No doubt . But , I wo n't sacrifice my girl to finish your education . Re-enter SEELIG with BURRILL . DR . SEELIG Mr. Burrill is going . He first wishes to speak with Mr. DE LOTA . MRS . SEELIG Why ? DR . SEELIG Sarah ! MRS . SEELIG Pardon . BURRILL A business matter , Mrs. Seelig . If you are leaving , Mr. De Lota , I 'll walk with you  --  if you permit . DE LOTA I have some business with Dr. Seelig . BURRILL Could you spare us a few minutes ? DR . SEELIG Well ? De Lota ? DE LOTA With pleasure . DR . SEELIG Going . Sarah . MRS . SEELIG In undertone . You told him ? SEELIG nods . Goes out with MRS . SEELIG . DE LOTA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to retire from this , Mr. De Lota , without exposure . p. 105 DE LOTA Good of you . BURRILL Miss Seelig believes that you have served time in a penitentiary . DE LOTA You told her that ? BURRILL I had n't met you when I told Miss Seelig that the man who got an engagement in Antoine 's Theater for Mimi Chardenet had been in prison . Then you came into the room and told the rest yourself . DE LOTA Miss Seelig 's belief is based on those two remarks ? BURRILL Yes . DE LOTA Reinforced , I suppose by your own opinion . BURRILL I have tried to conceal my opinion . DE LOTA What is your opinion , Mr. Burrill ? BURRILL That I saw you sentenced in the Cour d'Assizes to a year 's imprisonment . DE LOTA And you threaten to say so ? BURRILL I hope I 'm a little cleaner than that , I threaten nothing . DE LOTA What is it you 're doing ? BURRILL I foresee trouble  --  I inform you of it . DE LOTA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? p. 106 BURRILL Yes ! I foresee your answer failing to satisfy . I foresee her doubt grow deeper  --  I foresee her going to her father with that doubt . DE LOTA And then ? BURRILL I foresee Doctor Seelig asking what I know . DE LOTA Ah ! Now we have it . Disguised , but still the threat . You tell Doctor Seelig your belief . BURRILL I shall decline to express my belief . DE LOTA Same thing , is n't it ? Your reluctance and your shrugs being quite as convincing . BURRILL You can hardly ask me to lie for you . DE LOTA Miss Vedah may believe me . BURRILL No , she has asked me more than once to write to Paris . DE LOTA It would make this bluff of fair play very convincing if you did write to persons whose names I can furnish you . BURRILL You mean arrange a deception . DE LOTA I mean write  --  show Miss Seelig your letters . Wait  --  show her the answers . BURRILL You make it pretty hard to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm unworthy to marry this girl . p. 107 BURRILL I know you are . DE LOTA Pause . I 'm going to tell you the truth about that Paris affair . BURRILL I do n't care to hear it . DE LOTA You do n't want the truth ? BURRILL I do n't want your confidence . I wo n't be bound by it . DE LOTA You 're a man 's man , Burrill  --  you fight in the open . Your part in this architect 's row shows that . Now , in fair play  --  Telephone rings . BURRILL Someone will come to answer that . Our interview 's at an end . DE LOTA Wait . Goes quickly to telephone and takes receiver from its hook . They may not come . Pause . I have served a year in a French prison . Captain Dreyfus served even longer for the same prejudice . BURRILL Your crime was proven . DE LOTA I 'm as good as you , Mr. Burrill , or any bachelor that spends his several years in Paris . That imprisonment was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a male ingenue . Doctor Seelig knows I 've had my wild oats and I 'll make a clean breast of it  --  my sufferings for my race will not be held against me . Vedah Seelig is a Jewess , remember , and  --  p. 108 BURRILL Be still , she 's a clean , high-minded girl  --  she 'll forgive adultery in you no quicker than she 'd forgive it anywhere . DE LOTA You think so ? BURRILL I do . DE LOTA And that belief determines you to bring it to her knowledge ? BURRILL It is already brought to her knowledge . You did that . DE LOTA And you make the consequence as sinister as if it had been planned ? BURRILL I wo n't conspire to hoodwink a girl into marrying you . Enter SEELIG . Pause . DR . SEELIG That ' phone rang ? DE LOTA Yes  --  I was going to answer it . DR . SEELIG I answered it  --  on the branch  --  upstairs . I heard what you were saying . BURRILL Through that ? DR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DE LOTA I was telling Mr. Burrill a story  --  for a magazine . DR . SEELIG To BURRILL . Is that true ? p. 109 BURRILL I ca n't answer you . DR . SEELIG In prison ! DE LOTA The man I was quoting . DR . SEELIG Why should a man in a story say : " Vedah Seelig is a Jewess , remember . " Why should Mr. Burrill interrupt you to defend her ? BURRILL Good day , Doctor . BURRILL goes . DR . SEELIG Your confession  --  just now  --  Indicates ' phone . DE LOTA At that time in Paris , with public hatred at a white heat , an obsolete law was dug up to persecute a foreigner and a Jew . DR . SEELIG What law ? DE LOTA Imprisoning a man on the complaint of a woman 's husband . DR . SEELIG We are fortunate to learn it . DE LOTA There are some Jews I 'd expect to condemn me  --  apostates , renegades , that join the wolves , but not you . That imprisonment was my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big enough to see that and dismiss it . As for the offense itself  --  well  --  you know men , Doctor Seelig . You 're a physician  --  not a Rabbi . DR . SEELIG Clayton 's home was not your first adventure ? p. 110 DE LOTA I did n't know this man in Paris . DR . SEELIG You knew Clayton ? DE LOTA Yes . DR . SEELIG That 's enough . DE LOTA And Mrs. Clayton ? DR . SEELIG What of her ? DE LOTA You brought her here . DR . SEELIG Well ? DE LOTA You excuse her and condemn me ? DR . SEELIG Pause . There is a cynical maxim that every country has the kind of Jews it deserves . This generous New York deserves the best . A Jew has destroyed the home of a benefactor , a Jew intimate in my own home approved by me and mine . I shall do what I can to repair that destruction . DE LOTA There 's some extenuation . DR . SEELIG What ? DE LOTA This engagement to Vedah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love . There was one other  --  when I was much younger . The father of the Christian girl was a Jew-baiter . DR . SEELIG Well ? DE LOTA I was thrown over  --  not because I was n't a man  --  not because I had n't ability  --  nor ambition  --  nor strength  --  nor promise of success but  --  I was a Jew . p. 111 DR . SEELIG You will pay that price  --  the price of being a Jew  --  almost every day of your life . DE LOTA I know  --  in money  --  in opportunity  --  in sensibilities  --  yes ; but that time I paid it  --  with all those and  --  more . Pause . Consider then the temptation when that woman who had thrown me over and married her Christian found that she still could listen to the Jew . DR . SEELIG Pause . This would be a proud moment for me , Benjamin , if one of my own people had told me that story just as you have told it except  --  that his revenge had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . CLAYTON enters violently . FRANK To HOLLAND who restrains him . Do n't put your hand on my arm . Seeing DE LOTA . I thought so . DR . SEELIG Interposing . Thought what ? FRANK I called you on the ' phone  --  I heard that dog 's voice . DR . SEELIG One moment  --  To DE LOTA , who confronts CLAYTONGo . DE LOTA starts out. p. 112 FRANK He came here to see her . DE LOTA Angrily returning . Yes . To see her ! DR . SEELIG Loudly and again interposing . I said go . DE LOTA sullenly goes . FRANK And you stand for it . Your house . DR . SEELIG Judge Hoover was with Mrs. Clayton  --  also Mrs. Seelig  --  then I. FRANK And my boy . Where was Dick ? DR . SEELIG In his room . FRANK Well , I want him . He sha n't be corrupted by their damned assignations . DR . SEELIG His first call , Frank , and his last . FRANK That part of it does n't interest me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason . FRANK I thought they 'd get together on that . Well  --  I want Dick . Pause . Send for him , please . DR . SEELIG In a minute . He 'll be glad to see you  --  but you must n't say anything before him you 'll regret . FRANK I promise . I just want him , that 's all . p. 113 DR . SEELIG He 's with his mother , you know . FRANK Well ? DR . SEELIG And Judge Hoover is also with Elinor . FRANK What of it ? DR . SEELIG Nothing  --  except  --  well , the boy . There must n't be a dispute , Frank . FRANK Say that to them . DR . SEELIG And you ca n't treat Mrs. Clayton as though she were a guilty woman . FRANK Why ca n't I ? DR . SEELIG Because in the first place she is n't guilty . FRANK Is n't ? DR . SEELIG No . FRANK She fools you , Seelig . DR . SEELIG The physician who takes a woman through the sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ca n't be deceived , Frank , and in the second place you have forfeited the right to judge her  --  you came into court yourself unclean . FRANK And therefore ca n't resent adultery . DR . SEELIG Her defiant visit to De Lota 's rooms was n't adultery . FRANK Damnation ! when a woman 's gone that far , the specific degrees of her behavior are n't important . p. 114 DR . SEELIG They 're very important , especially when they show recovery . A woman who stops at the edge of the precipice instead of taking the headlong plunge , must n't be thrown into the gulf  --  and that by the man she herself had already rescued  --  by the man whose brutality forced her into the peril . FRANK Brutality ! DR . SEELIG A word ill chosen  --  I meant bestiality  --  who are you to pass sentence upon her ? FRANK Unfortunately the man who married her . DR . SEELIG Why ! Dismiss the moral view of marriage . Consider it only as our modern and manly and commercial mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more . FRANK What then ? DR . SEELIG Why , even then your position is that of a thief  --  a confessed embezzler  --  complaining in his hypocrisy of what ?  --  that his partner 's books appear inaccurate . That is the proportion . On the sacred side of the relation you are doubly guilty  --  guilty of your immoral conduct  --  guilty of your base example and guilty of goading a good woman into desperate things . For God 's sake , Frank Clayton , cleanse your mind of its masculine conceit , prejudice , selfishness and partiality  --  recognize your own destructive work  --  admit it  --  regret it , unto it , and ask a good woman 's forgiveness . CLAYTON laughs ironically . HOOVER and ELINOR enter . Her appearance stills CLAYTON , as he turns and sees her . p. 115 ELINOR Frank ? Extends her hand pleadingly . FRANK Well ? ELINOR I 'm in the dust  --  forgive me . DR . SEELIG In undertone . Judge  --  Starts out , HOOVER following . FRANK Checking them . No  --  none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repentance . ELINOR You  --  you 're not going to drag the  --  the whole story into the courts . FRANK I 'm going to  --  Pause. do only what is necessary . ELINOR Sits  --  speaks with effort at control . As we forgive  --  those that trespass against us  --  FRANK It 's too late to adjust matters with a few appropriate quotations . HOOVER You wo n't waive any right by a reasonable delay . DR . SEELIG None  --  so for pity 's sake , Frank , tell Colonel Emory to wait . FRANK I 've retained my own counsel  --  I do n't ask other advice . p. 116 ELINOR Brokenly . Why  --  why do you come to see me ? FRANK I do n't ! I came because your friend Mr. De Lota was here with you . ELINOR Frank ! HOOVER I brought De Lota . FRANK Explosively . I do n't object . Then with fateful control . I 'm just going to take Dick out of the muck , that 's all . ELINOR Dick ! HOOVER Bristling . The law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father  --  do n't  --  do n't . We must n't talk of law and its wrangle over Dick . Frank 's perfectly right . If I were meeting Mr. De Lota after the terrible mistake of that night Dick should n't be in my care at all . Turns to CLAYTON . It  --  it was on account of the suit  --  that 's all . If you let Colonel Emory do that cruel thing without believing me . Father brought him  --  Dick was n't here . I said that I would n't bring up my jealousy of that woman in Paris  --  nothing to blacken the name of Dick 's father  --  did n't I ? Turns to HOOVER. p. 117 HOOVER She did . ELINOR Again to CLAYTON . You must see Dick  --  but leave him here , Frank , until you know the very truth  --  about  --  it all . You get him , father  --  HOOVER Going . Of course . I 've seen fifty cases that looked worse than this smoothed out by a little patience . ELINOR Anxiously . Get Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HOOVER Turning . De Lota 's statement to me , Frank , was identical with Elinor 's . FRANK Never mind . HOOVER Coming back . I 've got to mind  --  you 're not informed . Elinor and De Lota were friends before you ever came to New York . ELINOR tries to silence HOOVER . FRANK Friends ? ELINOR Pause , and as CLAYTON glares at her . Yes . To HOOVER . Get Dick . Go  --  do n't say any more . HOOVER goes . p. 118 FRANK Accusingly . I introduced De Lota to you only a year ago . ELINOR I know , but  --  FRANK Why pretend you were not acquainted ? ELINOR I  --  I was considering his feelings . FRANK What do you mean by that ? ELINOR Before I knew you  --  we were engaged . FRANK Engaged ! ELINOR He and I. Father objected on account of De Lota 's race  --  and  --  Father forbade me ever to speak of it in his hearing . When you and I met I was still oversensitive about it and  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do . You ca n't square it . I see it now . I 've been a dupe for years and years . ELINOR I never saw him again until you brought him home . FRANK Do n't , I 'm through with it . Going . ELINOR Frank  --  do n't go  --  wait ! See Dick ! FRANK Turning . Dick . ELINOR You must see your boy . p. 119 FRANK My boy ! How do I know he 's my boy ? ELINOR and SEELIG both exclaim . ELINOR Oh ! DR . SEELIG Frank ! FRANK You 've lived a lie about that blackguard all along until I trap you in his room . ELINOR But Dick  --  our baby Dick . For God 's sake , Frank , do n't say a thing like that . FRANK Why not , if it 's here  --  here  --  Striking forehead . And hell itself ca n't burn it out . DR . SEELIG At the door . Frank  --  it 's the boy . FRANK No  --  no ! Turns and goes rapidly out by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What have I done ? I did n't know  --  I did n't know . DICK To ELINOR . Where 's Papa ? ELINOR With a heartbroken cry . Ah ! Kneels and takes DICK in her arms . My boy  --  my boy  --  Brushes back his hair . Our baby  --  boy . Kisses and embraces him hysterically , sobbing. @x SCENE : Same as Act II , the Lounging Room at Clayton 's . A large couch is drawn up in front of fire . The room is lighted only by the lamp on the small table and a candlelabrum near the telephone . The pictures on the wall are awry , and there is a look of general desolation about the place . A window is open at left side of room and the sound of church bells comes in . DISCOVERED : CLAYTON on couch near fire  --  steamer rug over him  --  he in dressing gown and slippers . His shoes are on floor . Enter SUTTON from dining room carrying tray . SUTTON I beg pardon , sir . FRANK Well ? SUTTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought maybe you 'd try it , sir . FRANK Indifferently . Thank you , Sutton . SUTTON Putting tray on table at head of the couch . Shall I put it nearer ? CLAYTON shakes head . If you 'd rather have a milk punch , sir ? FRANK No . SUTTON Or an egg-nogg  --  CLAYTON shakes head. p. 121 FRANK You might shut that window . SUTTON Yes , sir . Going to the window . FRANK Those damn bells  --  SUTTON Yes , sir . Closes window . FRANK When did Doctor Seelig say he 'd come ? SUTTON As soon as possible . FRANK And it 's been three hours . SUTTON Nearly three hours , yes , sir . There 's the door  --  may be Doctor now . Goes to hall . CLAYTON re-arranges pillow and lies down again . HOOVER 'S voice is heard outside . SUTTON Also outside . He 's lying down  --  in the smoking room . Enter SUTTON . HOOVER and ELINOR appear in hallway . SUTTON Leaning over the back of the couch . Pardon , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SUTTON And Mrs. Clayton , sir . p. 122 FRANK Sitting up . Here ? HOOVER Entering . I do n't want to intrude , Frank , but  --  it seems necessary . Come in , Elinor ! SUTTON goes . ELINOR comes down to the couch . FRANK You 'll have to see my attorney . I 'm not able to talk any business . ELINOR Tenderly . You 're ill , Frank ? FRANK Coldly . Resting a minute  --  ELINOR I 'm sorry to disturb you , but  --  it 's for Dick . Pause . CLAYTON motions slightly to a chair which HOOVER places  --  ELINOR sits . You know that to morrow is  --  a holiday ? CLAYTON nods . Dick 's eager about it  --  FRANK Complainingly to HOOVER . This is n't necessary , is it ? ELINOR Dick 's talked for days about his tree and hanging up his stocking by the big fireplace at home . Our difference , Frank , must n't put a blight on the boy 's Christmas . FRANK In undertone . My God ! What drivel ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will  --  but not as little Dick talks it day after day . His love for you is n't drivel . FRANK To HOOVER . You promised Emory to begin suit if I 'd keep quiet . HOOVER Yes . FRANK Nearly a month ago . HOOVER I know  --  but  --  Turns to ELINOR . ELINOR I refuse . There 's nothing left me to live for but my baby and his happiness . I wo n't  --  I wo n't bring an accusation against his father  --  CLAYTON moves away wearily to mantel  --  ELINOR rises . You are his father and only your wish to crush me makes you pretend todoubt it . I 've forfeited your love , I know  --  I 'm not here to plead against that  --  but to avoid any scar I can for the boy 's heart . I want you to let Dick come here to-morrow  --  CLAYTON moves impatiently . Not with me  --  with Miss Doane . I want you to see him  --  and take him in your arms  --  FRANK Shakes head . No  --  HOOVER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child , and for seven years this was his home . p. 124 FRANK There 'll be other anniversaries . He may as well learn now . ELINOR No  --  not now . When he 's old enough to understand I 'll tell him  --  the truth . FRANK What is the truth ? ELINOR That his mother  --  was a foolish woman who thought her husband did n't understand her . That his father punished her out of all proportion to her offense , but only as women must expect punishment . FRANK Sneering . I know  --  because men are brutes . ELINOR Because  --  God has put into woman 's keeping a trust  --  of which no one  --  neither husbands nor fathers tell them truly  --  about which the world in its vain disputes of equality misleads them  --  of which they learn only through their own suffering . FRANK Leaving ELINOR and going to HOOVER . This kind of thing is  --  what I try to escape . ELINOR Following . Let Dick spend his Christmas morning here . CLAYTON shakes head . You used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel pose of pretending that he 's not your boy . p. 125 FRANK To HOOVER . Please  --  ELINOR I could n't tell you in Doctor Seelig 's presence plainly enough . You know Father 's insane antipathy to  --  Pause. to those people . Any word  --  the most sacred  --  any name  --  the most honored  --  by scornful repetition becomes a reproach , and I had grown fearful of ridicule about my former friendship for  --  Ben De Lota . That was my sole reason for silence . FRANK Wearily . My God ! HOOVER Elinor , Frank ! Indicates hall . BURRILL Outside . Is he too ill to be seen a moment ? HOOVER Peering cautiously into hall . Woman , too . Enter SUTTON . SUTTON Mr. Burrill , sir . FRANK I said no one but Doctor Seelig . SUTTON Miss Seelig , Doctor 's daughter , is with Mr. Burrill . ELINOR Father ! Going quickly out by dining room door . HOOVER Following . I want a word , Frank , when they 're gone . p. 126 FRANK But not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOOVER leaves . FRANK My coat ! SUTTON gets CLAYTON 'S coat and waistcoat from the table  --  CLAYTON takes them and nods for SUTTON to go . SUTTON goes . CLAYTON feebly unbuttons his dressing gown , pauses , wearily throws coat and waistcoat to a chair from which they slip to the floor . CLAYTON sits on the couch . BURRILL and VEDAH enter . BURRILL Sorry to disturb you , Mr. Clayton . VEDAH And your man says you 're not well . FRANK Nothing ! Wo n't you be seated ? VEDAH takes chair BURRILL places for her . BURRILL I 'm  --  Pause . That is , we 're  --  well , I wanted to thank you for my contract on the court-house sculpture . FRANK They gave it to you , did they ? BURRILL Yes . The finished marble must be up in a year . Material  --  workmen  --  studio  --  everything 's cheaper on the other side  --  p. 127 FRANK I know . BURRILL So I 'm sailing day after to-morrow  --  unless you need me here in the architect 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have ? CLAYTON nods . BURRILL turns eagerly to VEDAH . Then we go  --  VEDAH Yes ! BURRILL Vedah and I have been married . FRANK Married ? BURRILL Half an hour ago . VEDAH Yes . Rises and stands by BURRILL . BURRILL Taking VEDAH 'S hand . I 'm the happiest man alive . FRANK Moodily . Half an hour ? Ah , yes . With an effort rises and goes to them . Well , I congratulate you both . VEDAH Papa and Mama do n't know it yet . BURRILL goes to the fireplace . FRANK An elopement ? VEDAH Is it ? If we did n't leave the city ? Enter SUTTON . p. 128 SUTTON Mrs. Seelig , sir . VEDAH anxiously goes to BURRILL . Enter MRS . SEELIG . SUTTON goes out . MRS . SEELIG Vedah . Sees BURRILL . You know your father 's wishes . BURRILL We 've been married , Mrs. Seelig . MRS . SEELIG Vedah ! VEDAH Yes , Mama . MRS . SEELIG When ? VEDAH At five o'clock . MRS . SEELIG How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peace . MRS . SEELIG Frank ! Turns to CLAYTON . VEDAH Going to her mother . Remember your parents objected to Papa . MRS . SEELIG To CLAYTON . My father was a Rabbi  --  Doctor Seelig 's ideas were advanced  --  even his own people thought so . VEDAH No couple could be happier than you have been . MRS . SEELIG Is this happiness  --  my only daughter runs away  --  why ? To-day ? Why secretly ? p. 129 BURRILL I 'm sailing for Paris . VEDAH Returning to BURRILL . To be gone a year . BURRILL The separation was impossible . MRS . SEELIG Could n't you have trusted Vedah that long ? VEDAH It was I , Mama . MRS . SEELIG You ? VEDAH To risk a sculptor in Paris ? Oh no ! MRS . SEELIG Well , go home and tell your poor father . VEDAH I want you with us , Mama . BURRILL I 'm willing to tell the Doctor alone . VEDAH In alarm . No . MRS . SEELIG Very well , wait for me and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! They shake hands . FRANK Good-bye . Shakes hands with BURRILL . Bon voyage . BURRILL Thank you . Starts out with VEDAH . MRS .

SEELIG Sighing and turning to CLAYTON who is at the fireplace . I left Elinor  --  waiting for Judge Hoover . When I go back I want to carry her some comfort . FRANK Your arrival will do that , Mrs. Seelig . MRS . SEELIG I hope so . This is Christmas Eve , you know . FRANK Yes . MRS . SEELIG Little Dick has always found his stocking  --  in there . Indicates the music room . FRANK Mrs. Clayton must n't use Dick to break down my decision . MRS . SEELIG I bought a little tree  --  Indicates its height .

CLAYTON turns away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the race  --  but Vedah is going with that young man  --  my own heart is alive to the suffering around us .

Sits wearily on couch. p. 131 MRS . SEELIG Sympathetically . He did n't tell us . FRANK Not Doctor Seelig . MRS . SEELIG Oh ! FRANK A specialist  --  but he does n't help me . Sutton phoned and I 'm waiting for Doctor Seelig now . MRS . SEELIG Now ? I ca n't meet him here . But that tree 's in the house and you must let us bring Dick over . Enter HOOVER . HOOVER Pardon . MRS . SEELIG I 'm going  --  Good night . She goes . FRANK Pause . Where is  --  ? HOOVER Elinor ? CLAYTON nods . She left immediately . CLAYTON lies down on couch . She 's  --  not  --  a bad woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but we all learn . I did n't know the hearts those people had in ' em  --  Pause .

CLAYTON shakes head . No other pains ? CLAYTON shakes head . What kept you in the house ? FRANK I feel all in  --  rotten tired . DR . SEELIG I 'd have come earlier , Frank , but a long list . Then there was an accident to a little chap on Third Avenue  --  they brought him to the hospital  --  smaller than your boy . We operate on him at eight-thirty . Regards watch . When I got away from that the police stopped us at every cross street . Wonderful sight on the Avenue  --  people seem to have money . I think a prosperity Christmas .

" Glad tidings of great joy . " DR . SEELIG Comes only once a year . p. 134 FRANK You any respect for the whole business  --  that Christ fabrication ? DR . SEELIG Going to fireplace . You mean the Church idea  --  the creeds ? FRANK Yes . DR . SEELIG Pause . I 've outgrown the one my own mother started me in , but I take off my hat to the man . FRANK Why ! DR . SEELIG Oh , He knew  --  He 'd worked it all out . FRANK Worked what out ? DR . SEELIG This thing we call Life . He knew the essence of it . FRANK I do n't see that . DR . SEELIG " As a man thinketh "  --  that was His answer . FRANK What does that answer ? DR . SEELIG Everything . When I felt your pulse there and let go your hand you carried it back to the couch  --  so . FRANK Expect me to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd hoped you would drop it a little . FRANK Why ? DR . SEELIG Hoped you 'd relax . Let 's try it now . Lifts CLAYTON 'S hand . Do n't tense those muscles  --  put your weight on me . Drops hand . There ! p. 135 FRANK Well , what does that do ? DR . SEELIG That 's the only part of your body that 's relaxed  --  Now a deep breath and let go . Do n't hold yourself up from the couch . So ! CLAYTON does as told and perceptibly relaxes . FRANK Nerves , I know . DR . SEELIG Tapping his own forehead . It 's this . Why , I have patients  --  business men  --  who are always tied up like a wet fishing line  --  sleep that way . Do you know why that wrinkle is between your eyes ? FRANK I 'm sick , that 's why . DR . SEELIG Because the wrinkle 's in your mind . That coat I took from the floor said mental wrinkles , " As a man thinketh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now  --  come ? FRANK You do n't have to ask , do you ? DR . SEELIG I do ask . FRANK Just to keep my mind on it , I suppose ? DR . SEELIG No  --  I want to hear you talk about it . FRANK My mind will be all right , I 'll be all right , when that damned dog is dead in hell ! DR . SEELIG Pause . You hate him pretty bitterly , do n't you ? p. 136 FRANK I hate him the best I know how . DR . SEELIG You know what good hating does to the hater ? FRANK You mean to me ? DR . SEELIG Nodding . To everybody . Kills him . FRANK Kills him ? SEELIG nods . DR . SEELIG Pause . Hate generates one of the deadliest poisons in nature . I 've had trouble in my time saving a baby that had nursed milk from the breast of an angry woman . You 've heard of the bite of a blue gum negro being poison . FRANK Knew a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is no more poisonous than the bite of a red gum negro , or the bite of a red gum white man , if either of them gets angry enough , the blue gum negro is just a little nearer the animal and gets mad quicker , that 's all . Now , you lie here with this grouch of yours and you generate constantly an internal poison . I have n't any medicines that can beat that . FRANK When I get so much of it in me that I shoot that cur , as I shall some day , they 'll call it murder . DR . SEELIG Pause . I used to get pretty angry when I was younger , but I think it was more to show off . p. 137 FRANK You mean I do this to " show off ! " DR . SEELIG I mean you are influenced by public opinion . If you and he were the only creatures left in the world you 'd admit he did n't do much more than you 'd have done in his place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and ruin it ? DR . SEELIG This man did n't come into your home and ruin it . He meets an old sweetheart , meets her when she thinks she is being neglected . FRANK Sitting up . Neglected ? Why , she had this house and our summer place at Newport  --  a forty-five horse-power limousine  --  she had  --  DR . SEELIG See here , Frank , you were neglecting her . He did what nine men out of ten would do . He knows the price that 's being paid , and I know , that he 'd walk around the Belt Line to-night in the snow , barefooted , to have the record closed . FRANK Suppose you think I ought to hunt him up and shake hands with him ? DR . SEELIG No  --  do n't think you should ever see him again , even mentally ; but it does n't need murder to acquire that attitude . I want you to be big enough to dismiss it . That 's why I quote this carpenter-prophet of Nazareth  --  a truth that took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrate  --  He found out by himself . He said in one of his first sermons : " Forgive , and ye shall be forgiven ; give and it shall be given unto you , good measure pressed down , shaken together and running over shall men give unto your bosom . " p. 138 FRANK Oh that religious elation  --  DR . SEELIG It was n't religion He was preaching , but a good working rule of life . This precept of good-will  --  people regard the words " Good-will " as interchangeable with " Peace , " but will is active , good-will is a constructive force . I 've seen sick people get well merely through two or three hearty good wishers rooting for them . I 've figured it out that there 's an influence circulating through all men when they 'll permit it , just as the current through that lamp goes through all other lamps in this house . Stop it in the man by avarice or cupidity , divert it by envy , turn it back by hate , and something goes wrong with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unto you . " FRANK You take Him too literally , Doctor . DR . SEELIG The mistake is not taking Him literally enough . I 've cured many taking that sermon literally . Sits beside CLAYTON on his couch . I find what is on the patient 's mind . Generally some hate or fear  --  sometimes regret or remorse  --  then I try to show the patient that yesterday is yesterday , that his past life does n't concern him any more than last year 's snow . If I can get a man looking ahead  --  hopeful  --  anxious to get on the job  --  why he 's cured . FRANK Doggedly . I 'll look ahead when I get even with this fellow . p. 139 DR . SEELIG Well , say you 've got even  --  that you 've dealt him some deadly blow , irreparably injured him or his happiness ! What then ? My dear Frank , there is nothing so disappointing as a satisfied revenge . FRANK I ca n't forget it . DR . SEELIG Yes you can . FRANK It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DR . SEELIG Because your mind is empty . Work is the answer to your condition . FRANK Shaking his head . Too late for that now . DR . SEELIG Nonsense ! Take this parable of the eleventh hour . The men in that were kicking because those who had worked one hour got as much as those who had put in a full day . Remember what the Nazarene proposed to pay . FRANK What ? DR . SEELIG Peace of mind . A sharehold in what He called the Kingdom of Heaven . The eleventh hour men worked only one hour , but they worked  --  the last hour . You get that peace of mind , whenever  --  you work , whenever you do something  --  and the splendid thing is , it 's never too late to do it . get up and work at something he does n't care for in order to forget something he 's thinking of all the time . It 's well enough for you  --  always called in by some poor devil who thinks you can help him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll talk hope and clean living myself . DR . SEELIG Half sadly . I know that attitude . It 's always the next pasture that seems the greenest . If I have any regret it is that instead of being a physician I was n't a priest . I think most diseases are not physical so much as they are mental or spiritual . FRANK Well , I 'd like to do that kind of thing myself . DR . SEELIG You can do it . FRANK I can ? DR . SEELIG Yes  --  only you have to begin . FRANK You mean with myself ? DR . SEELIG I mean with the work that 's nearest to you , Frank . If I wanted you to walk around Central Park you would have to get up , you would have to walk to the door ; you would have to go down the steps ; you would have to walk to Central Park . In other words , you would have to cover the ground that is nearest to you . Now , in the work you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to cover the ground that 's nearest you . Suppose you were going to save somebody and you had your choice  --  whom would you save ? Why , the people dearest to you . You would save  --  little Dick  --  eh ? p. 141 FRANK In pain . Do n't talk of Dick . DR . SEELIG I 've got to talk of him . The boy is n't getting a father 's care . FRANK You advised me not to take him . DR . SEELIG I still advise that . He is getting a mother 's care , but he needs a father 's also . Now suppose you could save little Dick . The next dearest person to you would be his mother , would n't she ? FRANK She 's made her bed . DR . SEELIG Yes , but after you 've made beds there 's something more to do than lie in them . After a reasonable time you are to get up and get out of them . FRANK She 's all right  --  free to do as she likes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a slave to her remorse  --  she 's looking back . She ca n't realize that yesterday is yesterday and that a dead yesterday is just as dead as Babylon . Now , you want work to do  --  why not do that ? FRANK Overlook what she 's done ? DR . SEELIG Yes  --  overlook what she 's done . She was n't perfect  --  nobody is . She makes one mistake  --  with you it 's final . You do n't judge anyone else that way . I 've seen you throwing little Dick the baseball teaching him to hold it and not to break his chubby fingers  --  standing two yards from him  --  drop and drop and drop it . You did n't get tired  --  you were developing the boy . Now the assumption is that Elinor came to you with her character fully developed ; but my dear old friend , character never stops developing if we are in the right line . There 's still the perfecting of a fine woman . You want something to do  --  do that . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I forgive her Pause. but that I 'm through with it just the same . DR . SEELIG I 'll not carry lies to her . If you forgive her you 'll go where she is  --  you 'll go looking forward and not backward  --  CLAYTON shakes head , pause  --  SEELIG regards watch . I hate to leave you in this mood , Frank . FRANK I 'll  --  be all right . DR . SEELIG Why not get in the machine and take a run through the Park  --  only a half hour  --  because I must get back to the hospital . FRANK Pause . You wo n't try any snap judgment on me  --  no driving up to your door and making a scene of it ? DR . SEELIG Chauffeur will take your order . Pause . CLAYTON begins to put on his shoes . SEELIG goes to the telephone . FRANK What are you doing ? DR . SEELIG I ca n't be home to dinner . ' Phones . Yes  --  operator . Give me 319 Plaza  --  Plaza  --  yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; just before you came  --  p. 143 DR . SEELIG Yes ? FRANK Pause . They expect you at dinner . DR . SEELIG ' Phoning . Holland ? Pause . This is Doctor  --  I 'll speak to Mrs. Seelig  --  Speaks to CLAYTON . What did she want ? FRANK Oh  --  Dick 's Christmas principally . DR . SEELIG That reminds me  --  I told Dick I 'd see you ' Phones . Hello ?  --  yes Sarah ? I ca n't get home to dinner dear  --  Pause . No  --  impossible . Pause . I 'm at Frank Clayton 's  --  Pause . Nothing  --  that is , nothing serious . He 's going out with me  --  just to get the air , that 's all . What 's that ? Pause . Yes , I 'll speak to her . FRANK Speak to whom ? DR . SEELIG Speaking to CLAYTON . Mrs. Seelig wants to know if I wo n't speak to your wife . ' Phones . Hello  --  that you , Elinor ? Pause . Yes  --  he 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're going out  --  in the car  --  I 'll give it to him . p. 144 FRANK Give what ? DR . SEELIG Just a minute . Turns to CLAYTON who is putting on his coat . It was a Christmas gift  --  from little Dick  --  he asked me to bring it here . FRANK What is it ? SEELIG takes small package from his pocket and hands it to CLAYTON . As CLAYTON opens package SEELIG turns attention to ' phone again . DR . SEELIG Yes , I 'm still here  --  yes . Listens in silence as CLAYTON undoes the package which contains a photograph in a leather case . CLAYTON bends over it , deeply moved . Yes  --  yes  --  very well  --  thank you  --  good night . FRANK Quickly . Wait . DR . SEELIG Startled by loudness of CLAYTON 'S call . Wait . Laughs and explains . I said wait a minute . FRANK She at that ' phone ? DR . SEELIG Yes . FRANK Angrily . Let me have it  --  there are a few things I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not in that mood , Frank . p. 145 FRANK It 's all a frame up to torture me . Takes ' phone speaks angrily . Hello ! Anger goes from his face  --  whole manner changes  --  tone becomes gentle and affectionate . Dick , that you , Dick ? Pause . Yes , I hear you  --  Pause . I got it , my boy , thank you  --  Pause . You bet I like it  --  Pause . The tree ? Pause . Yes , by the big fireplace  --  Pause . To-night ? Well  --  Pause . Then  --  Pause and effort . Tell her to come  --  with you ! Drops ' phone on table , receiver hanging towards the floor . Sinks into chair face down on elbow sobbing . SEELIG walks to ' phone , hangs up receiver . CLAYTON reaches out his right hand blindly . SEELIG takes it  --  holds it reassuringly and firmly . Gives CLAYTON a tonic slap on back and helps him rise . CLAYTON walks back to chair facing the fire . DR . SEELIG Solemnly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life  --  dazed by chloroform  --  wrung with pain  --  when her physician hears her speak the name of the man for whom she suffers . Pause . Every vestige of that doubt you uttered in my library must be effaced from your heart . Rings push button. p. 146 FRANK I did n't  --  invent the doubt . DR . SEELIG I know . FRANK I think  --  Pause . I hope to God I 'll get rid of it  --  in time . DR . SEELIG It must n't mar this reunion . Pause . When I started for this house  --  I hoped  --  for what has occurred . Indicates ' phones . I did n't know just how it would come about  --  but  --  I knew  --  that doubt had to be removed . FRANK I do n't want to think of it . Enter SUTTON . DR . SEELIG To SUTTON . A gentleman is outside in a cab , just behind my car ? Ask him to come in . SUTTON goes . FRANK Quickly turning . Who is it ? Pause . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank . FRANK Who ? DR . SEELIG Calmly . The one you hate . FRANK No ! By God , no ! Starts toward the hall . p. 147 DR . SEELIG Interposing and catching him . Frank  --  if you had to go under the knife you 'd trust me as a surgeon , would n't you ? FRANK Struggling to free himself . You 're bungling this job . DR . SEELIG Still holding CLAYTON . I 'm not bungling it . Enter DE LOTA . FRANK Do n't come in here . DE LOTA Mr. Clayton  --  DR . SEELIG Between the two men . Speak only when I bid you  --  Pause . To CLAYTON . Now listen ! To DE LOTA . Before Mr. Clayton introduced you to Mrs. Clayton a year ago  --  when had you last seen her ? DE LOTA About eight years before . DR . SEELIG That is nine years ago . DE LOTA Nine years ago . FRANK What 's one lie more or less . DR . SEELIG Where were you eight years ago ? DE LOTA In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 148 DE LOTA Pause . The prison de La Sant , in Paris . DR . SEELIG For how long a term ? DE LOTA One year . DR . SEELIG I asked you to bring your prison paper of discharge . DE LOTA hands paper to SEELIG . SEELIG regards paper and displays it to CLAYTON . You read French  --  numerals at least . The date is there . FRANK After a glance . Well ? DR . SEELIG Also Mr. Burrill was in the court-room when Mr. De Lota was sentenced . Pause . To show this paper , to admit in your hearing  --  this fact has not been an easy thing for Benjamin De Lota to do . He does it at my urging  --  the appeal of one Jew  --  to another Jew . He is going  --  he lives by writing criticism . His signature to an article has a money value  --  and despite these personal mistakes , I believe his influence in print is wholesome . He leaves your magazines . Of course , he ca n't expect their recommendation , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I sha n't  --  Pause . Interfere . SEELIG turns  --  DE LOTA goes . p. 149 DR . SEELIG Hand on CLAYTON 's shoulder . I 'm proud of you  --  Pause . Now forgive an old practitioner who knew he had to cauterize quickly . FRANK You 're  --  a friend all right . Pause . Prison ! DR . SEELIG That year . FRANK And I made that rotten accusation . What a brute I 've been ! DR . SEELIG My dear Frank , that also is yesterday . Pause and change of manner . Dick is coming to-night ? FRANK Yes . DR . SEELIG And his mother  --  CLAYTON nods . I 'll leave you alone . FRANK I 'd rather you were here . DR . SEELIG I 'll wait as long as I can . Consults watch . FRANK Seated on couch . There 's some troubling news for you . DR . SEELIG For me ? FRANK Nodding . I 'd like to cushion it if I could . DR . SEELIG You mean bad news ! p. 150 FRANK Depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know  --  Vedah  --  rather fancied Burrill , do n't you ? DR . SEELIG Yes . FRANK Burrill is sailing in a day or two  --  and  --  DR . SEELIG Pause . Well ? FRANK Well  --  they 've been  --  Pause . DR . SEELIG Calmly . Married ? FRANK To-day . SEELIG nods ruminatively . Enter DICK . MRS . SEELIG and ELINOR appear in arch . DICK Running to CLAYTON . Papa ! FRANK Why , Dick boy ! Embraces him . ELINOR goes into the music room . MRS . SEELIG comes down . DICK TO SEELIG . Did you give it to him ? DR . SEELIG Still brooding . Yes . p. 151 DICK To CLAYTON . You like it ? FRANK You bet I liked it . DICK laughs  --  CLAYTON leading DICK toward the music room speaks to MRS . SEELIG . I told the Doctor . MRS . SEELIG You mean  --  ? FRANK Vedah and Burrill . Goes with DICK into music room . MRS . SEELIG Coming to SEELIG 'S side . Samuel . DR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had no idea of it  --  but he has to cross the ocean . They love each other  --  Vedah was almost broken-hearted . We wanted Vedah to sacrifice her life to teach the idea of one God  --  but Samuel  --  Pause . Puts hand on SEELIG 'S arm . DR . SEELIG Well ? MRS . SEELIG The one God was wiser than my father , who was a Rabbi . He may be wiser than we are . Pause  --  SEELIG gently lifts her hand and kisses it . Pause . Samuel  --  they 're at home . Come forgive them and let 's be happy at dinner . SEELIG shakes head . You mean you wo n't forgive them ? p. 152 DR . SEELIG Pause . I mean only that I ca n't come to dinner . There is a surgery case at the hospital . MRS . SEELIG Pleading . Let someone else . DR . SEELIG Shaking head . Too important . MRS . SEELIG Who is it ? DR . SEELIG A little boy from the East Side . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty . MRS . SEELIG leaves his side . ELINOR enters , CLAYTON and DICK appear in doorway after her . ELINOR comes down to SEELIG . DR . SEELIG It 's all right ? ELINOR nods yes  --  takes SEELIG 'S face in both hands and kisses him . DICK To CLAYTON in childish treble.
