txt Gas Stove Delays . I wonder how many of 7our readers have had the experience I have been enjoying during the past two weeks In negotiating with the Consolidated Gas Company for the delivery of a gas stove at my flat Owing to the failure of the company to furnish a gas stove , for which they accepted an order . I am compelled to spend several dollars a day to obtain cooked food at restaurants , and I regret to say I am not at all certain that the Public Service Commission has the right to impose a fine for every such failure on the part of public service corporations to furnish the facilities which they are constantly urging the public to take advantage of .
