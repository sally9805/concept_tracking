T ACQUES LOEB 'S book on " Forced Movements , Tropisms and Animal Conduct " ( Lippincott ; $2.50 ) ? is offered as the first of a series of Monographs on Experimental Biology , to be followed by works by a dozen other authors . The books might perhaps better be advertised as studies of the physics and chemistry of living matter undertaken with the a priori belief in the mechanistic as opposed to the vitalistic explanation of life . The school is an important one , but , as in the case of the recent protective-coloration movement inaugurated by Abbott Thayer , the pendulum swings too far , and it is sought to explain too much . Professor Loeb is one of the most tolerant exponents of this school ; yet his first paragraph reads as follows : " Animal conduct is known to many through the romantic tales of popularizers , through the descriptive work of biological observers , or through the attempts of vitalists to show the inadequacy of physical laws for the explanation of life . Since none of these contributions are based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are generally of an anthropomorphic or of a purely verbalistic character . " This gives an insight into the bias of the entire school . In the course of nineteen chapters Dr. Loeb attempts to show that animal conduct can be studied satisactorily by the quantitative methods of the physicist and that these methods lead to the forced movement or tropism theory . From forced movements caused by such obviously abnormal conditions as injuries to parts of the brain and nervous system , he reviews experiments in the effects of electricity , light , movement , and finally geo- , stereo , chemo- , and thermo-tropisms . His thesis is satisfactory as long as he deals with the lower invertebrates where associative memory is absent , - but when he attempts , by the single factor of stereo-tropism , to account for the mating of even such generalized vertebrates as fish , he fails . And in the two final chapters , on instincts and memory images , by his claim that all the higher emotions and ... feelings of human beings are only complex forced movements , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he concludes that persistent will action is essentially a tropistic reaction , we are forced to align him with those on whom he looks down , as advocating speculation of a " purely verbalistic character . " The volume marks an advance in a valuable method of research . It is by no means what the prospectus claims , an " epochal event in American scientific progress , " nor is it " the most important step ever taken in America . " It deals in a satisfactory manner with one of a multitude of factors , known and unknown , which have brought about the origin and evolution of life on the earth . n NE inclined to choose or advise medicine for a life task will  - -  f find ample data and sound counsel to guide him to a decision in " Medicine as a Profession , " by D. W. and E. W. Weaver ( Barnes ; $1.50 ) . No attempt is made to hide the fact that the preparation for medicine is long and costly and the reward slow in coming and rarely adequate . The figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's caustic contention about the " disgraceful poverty " of the medical profession . ' Marked inclination and native ability are therefore prime requisites , perhaps more in this than in any other profession . The educational requirements and available facilities in the whole country are discussed in. detail , and are not limited to one so-called " system , " but include an outline of the theory and general differences of the principal " schools . " This may appear unnecessary to those who hold , with these authors , that all medical endeavor must be guided by a singleness of purpose and that this aim finds its fulfilment in the " regular " school . Conditions as they actually exist should certainly , be made known , howeVer ; for , after all , sects originate in response to a definite popular need and to a dissatisfaction with dominant doctrines . Their survival does not depend on theoretical justification but on superiority of service . Interesting and valuable also is the discussion of specialism , but the recommendation for thorough training and practice in general medicine to precede a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unattainable so long as technical apparatus keeps on increasing . The solution of this grave problem will probably have to be found elsewhere , possibly in a more coordinated division of labor . Many possibilities in this direction will suggest themselves to the reader of the thoughtful chapter on " The Future of Medicine . " He will also be impressed by the great number of salaried positions now open to medical men in the Government service and in private and public institutions . These are all discussed with lucid judgment . It almost looks as if already we were on the fair road toward the socialistic ideal in medicine . A good index and various tables increase the value of the book for reference purposes . The bibliography might be improved by certain additions and a few eliminations . T HE July issue of The American Journal of International Law , just appearing , three months late , opens with a noteworthy paper by Simon E. Baldwin , former Governor , and still earlier Chief Justice of the Supreme Court , of Connecticut , and from the date of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journal is the organ . He discusses The Membership of a World Tribunal for Promoting Permanent Peace . Believing that some kind of agreement between different Governments , closing present wars , must precede such a peace , he thinks such an agreement still must take the form of a treaty ; recognizing also that the step from a state of war to one of peace may be a long one ; though a seven years ' period of negotiation , such as preceded the Treaty of Westphalia , now would be intolerable . The old question of a Sanction still intrudes , and must be recognized . Whether in any conference the powers represented should be equal , or proportioned to weight in the scale of states , might be uncertain : clearly , such apportioning relatively to weight would be next to impossible . Whatever conclusion any world tribunal might arrive at , the objection to attempting by force of arms to compel compliance on any recalcitrant party , he thinks manifest . But he suggests there might be an agreement to resort to an imposition of international outlawry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure to compel compliance . The Editor-in-Chief , Professor Scott , considers the recently published Diary of Lord Haldane , covering negotiations in 1913 between Germany and England , illustrating the strained relations then existing between the two Governments . In the negotiations described , in which the Kaiser was on one or more occasions a participant , - the question of yearly additions to their respective navies was vital . As preceding by only a year the present war , the discussions or conferences recorded assume great significance . They reveal and exemplify the spirit and intention then controlling . Several other papers of high importance touch vital pending international problems . m HE re-appearance of Dr. Edward 0 . Otis 's " Tuberculosis " ( Crowell ; $1.50 ) , for the third time within ten years , suggests that the interest in the subject still continues . Dr. Otis is one of our earliest pioneers in the tuberculosis campaign . Long before it became organized into one of the most powerful public agencies , he had to face , practically unaided , conditions and an attitude of mind which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloom of utter hopelessness . Only a well-filled pocketbook insuring the victim a prolonged sojourn " out West " held out a promise . Everything else was palliative , prescribed because something had to be done , ? a sordid-array of cough medicines , restoratives , and alleged specifics . How different is the outlook now as it presents itself to the reader of these pages ! No panacea yet , - and there never will be one , for tuberculosis , like poverty , arises out of a multiplicity of causes which no single measure can destroy . We welcome the new attitude even more than the many detailed deductions from scientific findings . It is a great gain , we feel , that Dr. Otis can close the health rules at the end of his bo'ok with these words : " Let plenty of sunshine into your rooms . Joy is a great tonic . Happiness in work brings success . " Such admonition would have been smiled at in the early days , and the laboratory specialist will smile at them eternally , as he smiles at a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course Dr. Otis does not deny the communicability of the disease , and he shows in detail and clearly how this fact must affect measures of prevention ; but this does not prevent his turning forcibly against those features of the tuberculosis campaign which stir up unwarranted fear and terror by emphasizing the importance of infectiousness and contagiousness , as if , from the point of view of public health , it were the same as in measles , cholera , and plague . Evidence is constantly accumulating to show that contagiousness plays even a lesser role in the spread of tuberculosis than Dr. Otis 's book , in conformity with scientific teaching , still maintains . We hope that in a new edition the author may be able to put greater weight on the social and ethnic factors , for the ultimate solution of the problem will depend on their control . I N " Madame Roland : A Study in Revolution , " by Mrs. Pope-Hennessy ( Dodd , Mead ; $5 ) , the gifted Girondiste is described as a type of the femme savante that Moliere would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant dwelling upon her reading and her studies something of the pride in newly acquired privileges which savors of a parvenu spirit . She was ever conscious of having availed herself of opportunities denied to the average bourgeoise . She was an exception , and she never failed to impress that fact upon those about her . However , her girlhood preoccupation with her own destiny was for a time supplanted by her wifely ambition for her husband , whose position as Inspector General of Commerce at Amiens did not satisfy her . In this connection her trip to Paris to squeeze a patent of nobility out of the Government officials was not without farcical aspects . All she accomplished was Roland 's transfer to Lyons . This was the great turning point in her life ; for With it came the opportunity to work for her cause , or , as she called it , " la chose publique . " Within a month the Rolands became contributors to Brissot 's Le Patriote Francais and Champagneux 's Courier de Lyons , while intercourse and correspondence with men who subsequently became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and things . Pr HE volume of Messrs . Ayres , Williams , and Wood , " Health -- 1- ful Schools " ( Houghton Mifflin ; $1.50 ) , is a digest of the most available American opinion on questions of school hygiene , physical training , and school feeding . Mooted points involved in some of its ch4ters are suggested rather than definitely discussed , and the lists of books of reference , which are in their nature mainly intended for teachers , might very properly have been increased by various publications that have attracted international attention . The absence of European reports , especially of Scotch school studies , appears as a distinct omission . The methods of combating contagious diseases introduced within the last fifteen years into German schools might also have been referred to ; and in the chapter on medical inspection the value to the community of a high order of medical supervising officer , devoting his entire time , professional skill , and experience to the exclusive interests of the school-community , might have been emphasized . With the meagre salary allowance usually granted to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Complete absorption in the problems involved that will insure for the schools a high degree of hygienic efficiency . Somewhat incongruous in its relation to the rest of the volume seems the chapter on exceptional children , as it now stands ; it belongs properly to the sphere of school psychology , and should in such a connection receive far more detailed treatment . It is , in fact , one of the cardinal problems of school administration , of much greater scope than is indicated in this chapter ; the limitation Of the term " exceptional children " to backward and subnormal children is unjustified in these days , when the problem of the supernormal , exceptionally bright , precocious child also claims attention . Indifference to this type of child leads to as many life-failures as did formerly that standardized class instruction that took no cognizance of infirmities and handicaps . DISCIPLES of the modern cult of things Eastern will welcome sage , Kahil Gibran , which Alfred A. Knopf has published in the shape of " The Madman " ( $1.25 ) . Of Gibran , Rodin said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painter of Lebanon . He is the William Blake of the twentieth century . " We think , however , that most Westerners will find the- work repellent in its exotic perversity , and will lay it aside with an uncompre-hending shake of the head , for East is East and West is still West , and Tagore has not really succeeded in bridging the chasm between them , nor do we think that Gibran will do so . The most appealing of these parables is " The Wise Dog " ? though we frankly prefer La Fontaine : " One day there passed by a company of cats a wise dog . " And as he came ? near and saw that they were very intent and heeded him not , he stopped . " Then there arose in the midst of the company a large , grave cat , and looked upon them and said , ' Brethren , pray ye ; and when ye have prayed again and yet again , nothing doubting , verily then it shall rain mice . ' " And when the dog heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying , ' 0 blind and foolish cats , has it not been written and have I not known and my fathers before me , that that which raineth for prayer and supplication is not mice but bones . ' " possibly WAR story without a doctor in it seems somehow incAom- plete and unsatisfactory . As a counterpoise to mere physi-cal heroism , above the glory and lust of destruction , we like to see him ready for service to friend and foe alike , holding high the banner of a humanity united in suffering . The literature of past and present wars bears this out , and as we turn the pages of Colonel James Robb Church 's sympathetic narrative , " The Doctor 's Part " , ( Appleton ; $1.50 ) , it becomes quite clear why this is so . HiS is the military bonhomie without the rodo-montade , his also is the worldly wisdom of the superior physician without scientific pedantry . Colonel Church has evidently seen much in the two years which he spent on the western front as military observer .

" It is a book that will always 4ividly recall to us that we sent over there , not only good fighters , but good men and women to take care of them . To many an anxious or mourning parent that must be a supreme solace . O VER four hundred pages of facts in steady succession , with 1 --  . Ino hint of an index , is a literary crime . In these days of card catalogues and statistical tabulations it is inconceivable that this should be permitted . For it is more as a volume of reference than as an absorbing narrative of literary appeal that Leo E. Miller 's " In the Wilds of South America " ( Scribners ; $4.50 ) is of value , although its interesting details of natural history , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tion . Mr. Miller has much to offer the ornithologist , geographer , anthropologist , and general reader . An enormous territory is covered , over one hundred and fifty thousand miles ? Colombia , Venezuela , Guiana , the Roosevelt trans-continental expedition , Argentina ; practically every country in South America . The frontispiece , from a fascinating painting of the cock-of-the-rock in its nesting home , at once arouses a great desire to read of this magnificent bird , but ten minutes of fruitless search again make vivid the lack of value of an indexless book . The author is a collector of birds and animals for museum 's , and it is greatly " to his credit that in addition to this exhausting labor he found time to keep a well filled journal . HE Stratford Company has published a series of neat little volumes containing stories by some of the world 's best writers . Of Russian authors they have issued thus far stories by Tolstoy , Chekhov , Gorky , Bunin , and Andreyev . The low price ( 25 cents per volume ) does not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chekhov should have been represented by his artistic writings rather than by his early contributions to the daily press and to satirical magazines . Ivan Bunin , the excellent translator of Hiawatha , has written some good stories , so there was hardly any reason ? for introducing him for the first time to the English reading public through his lengthy and banal " Gentlemen from San Francisco . " The translator of Gorky 's " Because of Monotony " ought to know that " katsap " ( goat ) is a nickname given by Little Russians to the whiskered Great - Russians , and not vice versa , as the foot-note categorically states . There is room for improvement in this enterprise , though it is , on the whole , gratifying . IN " Such Nonsense " ( Doran ; $2 ) , Carolyn Wells has made a-I-copious and , on the whole , happy collection of comic verse , an , cient and modern . By way of being quite up to date , she includes Don Marquis 's " Lilies " and excerpts from Kenneth C. Beaton 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are well represented . To her pages devoted to limericks , she prefixes a note on the origin of that metrical form . The theory that it got its name from the fact that Edward Lear was born in Limerick she rejects , if only because he was , in fact , born in London . For ourselves , we think that the name arose from the words of the chorus generally used when limericks are sung : " Oh , wo n't you come up , come up , ? Oh , wo n't you come up , come up ? Oh , wo n't you come up , come up , come up , Come all the way to Limerick ? " We do not think that the word as applied to " nonsense verses " is of very early date .

T HE life-work of Sir Walter Raleigh , the tercentenary of whose ' death has just been commemorated in England and this ' country , is interestingly and suggestively described by E. A. Benians of Cambridge University in the Geographical Journal for November . To many it will be a surprise to learn that " if we except Bacon , none of his contemporaries had a wider range of knowledge or wrote on so many subjects with equal force and originality .

Art The Allied War Salon AFTER a visit to the Allied War Salon at the American Art Galleries , stay-at-home Americans will feel that through the vivid pictures drawn by men who have been part of the actual drudgery and routine of war , the great distance has been swept away and the war reaches to our very door-step . The drawings , grouped under the heading of " War Drawings of the Official Artists of the United States Army , " picture every imaginable phase of the war . A gloomy cellar with a group of haggard French and American , officers absorbed in their maps , tired sentries and a guttering candle expressive of the hurry and strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , disgorging masses of golden hay on to a rutted road ; an empty gaping chiateau in a wood , the former headquarters of the German Crown Prince ; French farm-yards with American trucks , American soldiers , French children , and French chickens all one busy mingled group  --  all these drawings create in the beholder the feeling of being no longer merely audience , but of becoming part of that world , with an understanding of its life . The most brilliant drawings are those by Wallace Morgan . They are beautifully and surely done , they have humor and truth , and they are quite unforgettable . There is a sketch called " Washing Up " ? a splashing gay scene at a village fountain , the Americans en deshabille , scrubbing every part of themselves with great thoroughness , and an audience of small French boys standing by utterly absorbed in these energetic gods from over the seas . Another of Mi . Morgan 's drawings shows an artillery division on its way back from the front , after days of hard fighting . It is rumbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horses with trembling knees and barely force left to reach their billets . There is still another amusing scene in a wood near the front , where each man had his own dug-out , and all one could see was a jaunty head and a pair of hands above ground , with the soldier reading a magazine or sleeping , cleaning a gun or cleaning his nails  --  sure human touches that spell the artist . A collection of Mr. Pennell 's fine lithographs of ' war industries has an imaginative quality that makes thundering factories and vast shipping yards regions of romance : The sick horrors of George Bellows offer little . In delightful contrast are the humorous sketches by George Wright , of awkward young sailors learning their very complicated vocation ; desperately attempt-. ing to wig-wag ; a whole boat-load trying to row together , with an immaculate young officer in icy despair at the tangle of oars .

Music The Philadelphia Orchestra T " privileges of musical New Yorkers are many , and the visits of the Philadelphia Orchestra with Leopold Stokowski as conductor are stimulating additions to the , winter 's feast . The execution and spirit at the last performance were brilliant . The Brahms symphony , Number 3 , which opened the programme , was finely played with singing'rhythm and beautiful tone , which found its leadership in the violins , and with great clarity of phrasing and structure , as satisfying as the balanced pattern of an old garden . Stokowski seems to listen to his orchestra as well as to instruct them , and to depend on and expect intelligent playing . His attitude is not that of a rigorous pedagogue sustaining his dependent disciples . Rather it expresses a high expectancy of the best they can offer , and consequently it evokes stirring response . After the symphony , Ossip Gabrilowitch played the Rachmaninoff concerto in C minor and h4 musicianship , the masterly sensing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked gradually to a climax in the last movement which was like the sonorous boom of a tremendous wave . The entire performance made one regret that Gabrilowitch should be conducting in Detroit and Stokowski in Philadelphia , and that New Yorkers should have the privilege of their visits only occasionally . Joseph Bonnet THE announcement of an organ recital by Joseph Bonnet brought to memory a happy evening . spent in St. John 's Church in Washington last winter , when Bonnet , with the magic of ancient melodies , pure-toned organ , and dim church , interpreted all the pageant of the centuries through his gay and serene music . But an organ recital in Aeolian Hall is a very different matter . M. Bonnet had concrete difficulties to overcome in the crass pinkness of the walls and ceiling , never sinking to neutrality , and in the unfortunate form of the hall , crushing down from above , and insistently preventing the detachment which a musical audience seeks . The programme began with a prelude by Henry Purcell graciously reminiscent of his songs , and went on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in D Minor . M. Bonnet then played a magnificent Fantaisie and Fugue by Franz Liszt which fully justified the note appended to the programme , expostulating with all the world for adoring Liszt as virtuoso and ignoring him as composer . The enthusiasm of the audience served to confirm Saint Saens 's judgment that the Fantaisie and Fugue was " the most extraordinary piece ever written for the organ . " Mr. Bonnet is a musician with real inspiration , vivid imagination , and richly colored variety in his playing , and is alisays a joy to hear .
