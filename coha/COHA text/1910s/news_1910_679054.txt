txt Physicians were hurriedly sent for from the Hudson County ( N. J. ) Jail yesterday afternoon to attend Porter Charlton , the young man imprisoned there pending ei= tradition proceedings to take him to Italy and try him for the murder of his wife at Lake Como . Dr. W. J. Arlitz , - Police Surgeon of Hoboken , who has been retained by Charlton 's relatives to investigate the prisoners sanity ; Dr. Charles B. Converse , the County Physician of Hudson County , and his assistant , Dr. A. P. Haskins , were summoned . Dr. Arlitz ex-. a.mined the prisoner at length . When he left the prison Dr. Arlitz said he had found young Chariton in an extremely nervous condition , and on the verge of a physical breakdown . At no time since . his arrest , ' he said , had the prisoner en in such a weakened physical and menq , . il state . Dr. Arlitz had already expressed the belief that Charlton was insane , being a victim , in his opinion , of dementia adolescence . and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first diagnosis was correct . Charlton was removed to the Hudson County Jail last Friday , and ever since he has been growing moodier and more reserved . Saturday he ate heartily of the special prison fare supplied by Warden Sullivan and slept fairly well , but he gradually became uncommunicative toward the prison officials and kept away from his prison associates , including . his cell mate , William , alias " Utley , " Burke ; the convicted safe robber , who is awaiting the outcome of an appeal from a. sevenyear sentence . Yesterday morning Charlton arose early from a broken sleep , and as soon as his cell door was opened he hurried into the corridor and began pacing up and down . This he kept up for several hours . He would not speak when addressed and seemed to chafe at his confinement . At noon he scarcely touched his food , and as soon as the meal was over he retired into his cell.and Ituried.himself in a new ( book that he had asked for on Saturday and which his counsel supplied . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who is keeping a sharp eye on Charlton , stopped to have a talk with him , thinking to cheer him up . To most of the Warden 's questions Charlton answered surlily . Finally the Warden tried him on the book . " Is it a good story , Porter ? " be asked . In an instant Charlton 's mood changed . He looked up with a smile . " It 's good literature . " he replied brisklr " I like it because I find something in at analogous to my own case . There is a woman in trouble , you know , and that appeals to me . It is more interesting than Bulwer Lytton 's ' Last Days of Pompeii , ' which I have just finished . " Seizing the hint that Charlton might be willing to discuss his life in Italy , the Warden put a more direct question . " low , you 're trying to pump me . I guess you 'd better go away , " was the reply as the prisoner turned his back on the Warden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a call from " Utley " Burke brought him on the run . " That fellow 's sure crazy . " said the safe robber . " I 'm afraid to stay in there with him . He 's moaning and going on as if he was going to have a fit . " Found Prisoner Moaning in His Cell . The Warden found Charlton sitting on his bed with his face in his hands moaning . Suddenly he jumped up and began to wring his hands . A spasm seemed to seize him and he shook as with the ague . The Warden thought it was time for medical help , and hurrying to the telephone he summoned Dr. Arlitz . After he had been with Charlton about an hour , Drs . Converse and Haskins ar-rived . Dr. Arlitz told them their services were not required , and they withdrew . About that time the Rev. Emil Meury , pastor ofthe Dutch Reformed Church of Jersey City , who also acts as the prison chaplain , arrived to hold his regular prison services . Thinking religious influence ' might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he attend the services-with the other prisoners in the corridor . ' ' No. cut out the religion , " said Charlton , turning away , " I do n't want any con solation . " Thinking the prisoner was weak from lack of food . Dr. Arlitz then sent out for a supply of , fruit . Charlton paid little attention to it and the physician stayed with him two hours longer . " Chariton is certainly a peculiar patient , " said Dr. Arlitz . " It is hard to tell just what is the matter with him . He does n't act normal at all . I have not made a complete physical examination of him yet . but I am positive that his father was right when he said the boy had consumption . His mind seems to be in a sort of haze . ' He has difficulty in remembering anything . I have refrained. from discussing the murder or the events which led up to it with him , because I found that it made him exceedingly irritable I did not think it necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not good for a demented man . " I found I could do more good by simply talking - to him  --  not about the case . but about things in general . That method soothed him down right away . I do n't want you to infer from that that hypnotism of any sort entered into it . Neither do I believe that he was self-hynotized when he committed the crime , as I have heard . The prisoner needs quiet and care more than anything else . In fact , It he does n't get plenty of good care it will kill him . Alienists Wo n't Discuss Findings ; ? " When I got to the jail to-day I found him in- a terribly nervous condition . He would close his hands spasmodically with such force as to dig the nails into the flesh . Then he would laugh in an ab : ' sent sort of manner , wander from the subject we were talking upon , and betray in many different ways the fact that ne t was holding himself in check with extreme difficulty . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under arrest , and I took part in the long examination the three New York alienists conducted last Friday . These alienists have not mentioned to me what their opinions are and I have n't asked them . I only know , from long experience with dement1 , ed people , that Charlton betrays every I evidence of not being in his right mind , land I do . not think he was in his right ' mind when he committed : the crime . " Dr. Edward B. Fisher , the New - York alienist whom the elder Charlton engaged . along with Dr. Allan Hamilton and Dr. Charles S. Dana , ? to examine Charlton as to his mental-cone dition , said - yesterday that he . . lot ready . yet - to makepublic whathis fit:Wings - are . lie ' said , the ' alienists wontst tnake another examination - of Charlton on Wednesday . . . " We agreed not to say a word about our examinations until we were all through with them , " said Dr. Fisher , " . and , it would be manifestly improper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examinations in time for the hearing before Judge Blair on Tuesday , but that will not make much difference , as I suppose it will be possible to get an adjournment . " Young Charlton 's father , brother , and stepmother , who left on Saturday to attend the funeral of the latter 's father at Baltimore , will return to the city to-day . ' This afternoon they will call upon the prisoner in company with their son 's attorneys . Emil Fuchs , - who has been retained by Capt . Henry H. Scott to represent him at Tuesday 's proceedings , when an effort will be made to take the case out of the hands of the Hudson County officials and turn Charlton over to the Federal ' authorities pending the outcome of extradition proceedings which have already been started by Gustavo di Rosa , Italian Vice Consul in this City , said yesterday that another large batch of Charlton 's letters , written only a few days before the murder , had been forwarded by Mr. Scott 's two mar ? ried , sisters , who corresponded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn these letters over to Vice Consul di Rosa to-day , " said Mr. Fuchs . " These letters show , even more than the earlier ones , how completely baseless is the assertion that young Charlton was insane while living in Italy . No saner letters were ever written . The writer tells . enthusiastically of his and his bride 's happiness , and through them all there runs a strain of humor which only a man in full possession of his faculties - would employ . When these letters are produced in court I think they will go a long way to offset the opinions of hired alienists who have been engaged to make this young man out insane . "
