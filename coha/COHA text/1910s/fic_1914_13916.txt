SCENE  --  A steamer 's life raft rising and falling slowly on the long ground-swell of a glassy tropic sea . The sky above is pitilessly clear , of a steel blue color merging into black shadow on the horizon 's rim . The sun glares down from straight overhead like a great angry eye of God . The heat is terrific . Writhing , fantastic heatwaves rise from the white deck of the raft . Here and there on the still surface of the sea the fins of sharks may be seen slowly cutting the surface of the water in lazy circles . Two men and a woman are on the raft . Seated at one end is a West Indian mulatto dressed in the blue uniform of a sailor . Across his jersey may be seen the words " Union Mail Line " in red letters . He has on rough sailor shoes . His head is bare . When he speaks it is in drawling sing-song tones as if he were troubled by some strange impediment of speech . He croons a monotonous negro song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their everlasting circles . At the other end of the raft sits a middle-aged white man in what was once an evening dress ; but sun and salt water have reduced it to the mere caricature of such a garment . His white shirt is stained and rumpled ; his collar a formless pulp about his neck ; his black tie a withered ribbon . Evidently he had been a first-class passenger . Just now he cuts a sorry and pitiful figure as he sits staring stupidly at the water with unseeing eyes . His scanty black hair is disheveled , revealing a bald spot burnt crimson by the sun . A mustache droops over his lips , and some of the dye has run off it making a black line down the side of his lean face , blistered with sunburn , haggard with hunger and thirst . From time to time he licks his swollen lips with his blackened tongue . Between the two men a young woman lies with arms outstretched , face downward on the raft . She is even a more bizarre figure than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complete short-skirted dancer 's costume of black velvet covered with spangles . Her long blond hair streams down over her bare , unprotected shoulders . Her silk stockings are baggy and wrinkled and her dancing shoes swollen and misshapen . When she lifts her head a diamond necklace can be seen glittering coldly on the protruding collar-bones of her emaciated shoulders . Continuous weeping has made a blurred smudge of her rouge and the black make-up of her eyes but one can still see that she must have been very beautiful before hunger and thirst had transformed her into a mocking spectre of a dancer . She is sobbing endlessly , hopelessly . In the eyes of all three the light of a dawning madness is shining . A DANCER  --  ( raising herself to a sitting posture and turning piteously to the Gentleman ) My God ! My God ! This silence is driving me mad ! Why do you not speak to me ? Is there no ship in sight yet ? p. 3 A GENTLEMAN  --  ( dully ) No . I do not think so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tries to rise to his feet but finds himself too weak and sits down again with a groan . ) If I could only stand up I could tell better . I can not see far from this position . I am so near the water . And then my eyes are like two balls of fire . They burn and burn until they feel as if they were boring into my brain . A DANCER  --  I know ! I know ! Everywhere I look I see great crimson spots . It is as if the sky were raining drops of blood . Do you see them too ? A GENTLEMAN  --  Yesterday I did  --  or some day  --  I no longer remember days . But to-day everything is red . The very sea itself seems changed to blood . ( He licks his swollen , cracked lips  --  then laughs  --  the shrill cackle of madness . ) Perhaps it is the blood of all those who were drowned that night rising to the surface . A DANCER  --  Do not say such things . You are horrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( She turns away from him with a shudder . ) A GENTLEMAN  --  ( sulkily ) Very well . I will not speak . ( He covers his face with his hands . ) God ! God ! How my eyes ache ! How my throat burns ! ( He sobs heavily  --  there is a pause  --  suddenly he turns to the Dancer angrily . ) Why did you ask me to speak if you do not care to listen to me ? p. 4 A DANCER  --  I did not ask you to speak of blood . I did not ask you to mention that night . A GENTLEMAN  --  Well , I will say no more then . You may talk to him if you wish . ( He points to the Sailor with a sneer . The negro does not hear . He is crooning to himself and watching the sharks . There is a long pause . The raft slowly rises and falls on the long swells . The sun blazes down . ) A DANCER  --  ( almost shrieking ) Oh , this silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me about anything you please but , for God sake , talk to me ! I must not think ! I must not think ! A GENTLEMAN  --  ( remorsefully ) Your pardon , dear lady ! I am afraid I spoke harshly . I am not myself . I think I am a little out of my head . There is so much sun and so much sea . Everything gets vague at times . I am very weak . We have not eaten in so long  --  we have not even had a drink of water in so long . ( then in tones of great anguish ) Oh , if we only had some water ! A DANCER  --  ( flinging herself on the raft and beating it with clenched fists ) Please do not speak of water ! A WEST INDIAN MULATTO SAILOR  --  ( stopping his song abruptly and turning quickly around ) Water ? Who 's got water ? ( His swollen tongue shows between his dry lips. ) p. 5 A GENTLEMAN  --  ( turning to the Sailor ) You know no one here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had yourself . ( irritably ) Why do you ask such questions ? ( The Sailor turns his back again and watches the shark fins . He does not answer nor does he sing any longer . There is a silence , profound and breathless . ) A DANCER  --  ( creeping over to the Gentleman and seizing his arm ) Do you not notice how deep the silence is ? The world seems emptier than ever . I am afraid . Tell me why it is . A GENTLEMAN  --  I , too , notice it . But I do not know why it is . A DANCER  --  Ah ! I know now . He is silent . Do you not remember he was singing ? A queer monotonous song it was  --  more of a dirge than a song . I have heard many songs in many languages in the places I have played , but never a song like that before . Why did he stop , do you think ? Maybe something frightened him . A GENTLEMAN  --  I do not know . But I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you stopped singing ? ( The Sailor looks at him with a strange expression in his eyes . He does not answer but turns to the circling fins again and takes up his song , dully , droningly , as if from some place he had left off . The Dancer and the Gentleman listen in attitudes of strained attention for a long time. ) p. 6 A DANCER  --  ( laughing hysterically ) What a song ! There is no tune to it and I can understand no words . I wonder what it means . A GENTLEMAN  --  Who knows ? It is doubtless some folk song of his people which he is singing . A DANCER  --  But I wish to find out . Sailor ! Will you tell me what it means  --  that song you are singing ? ( The negro stares at her uneasily for a moment . ) A WEST INDIAN MULATTO SAILOR  --  ( drawlingly ) It is a song of my people . A DANCER  --  Yes . But what do the words mean ? A WEST INDIAN MULATTO SAILOR  --  ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . It is a charm . I have been told it is very strong . If I sing long enough they will not eat us . A DANCER  --  ( terrified ) Eat us ? What will eat us ? A GENTLEMAN  --  ( pointing to the moving fins in the still water ) He means the sharks . Those pointed black things you see moving through the water are their fins . Have you not noticed them before ? A DANCER  --  Yes , yes . I have seen them . But I did not know they were sharks . ( sobbing ) Oh it is horrible , all this ! p. 7 A GENTLEMAN  --  ( to the negro , harshly ) Why do you tell her such things ? Do you not know you will frighten her ? A WEST INDIAN MULATTO SAILOR  --  ( dully ) She asked me what I was singing . A GENTLEMAN  --  ( trying to comfort the Dancer who is still sobbing ) At least tell her the truth about the sharks . That is all a children 's tale about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know they never eat anyone . And I know it . ( The negro looks at him and his lips contract grotesquely . Perhaps he is trying to smile . ) A DANCER  --  ( raising her head and drying her eyes ) You are sure of what you say ? A GENTLEMAN  --  ( confused by the negro 's stare ) Of course I am sure . Everyone knows that sharks are afraid to touch a person . They are all cowards . ( to the negro ) You were just trying to frighten the lady , were you not ? ( The negro turns away from them and stares at the sea . He commences to sing again . ) A DANCER  --  I no longer like his song . It makes me dream of horrible things . Tell him to stop . p. 8 A GENTLEMAN  --  Bah ! You are nervous . Anything is better than dead silence . A DANCER  --  Yes . Anything is better than silence  --  even a song like that . A GENTLEMAN  --  He is strange  --  that sailor . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DANCER  --  It is a strange song he sings . A GENTLEMAN  --  He does not seem to want to speak to us . A DANCER  --  I have noticed that , too . When I asked him about the song he did not want to answer at all . A GENTLEMAN  --  Yet he speaks good English . It can not be that he does not understand us . A DANCER  --  When he does speak it is as if he had some impediment in his throat . A GENTLEMAN  --  Perhaps he has . If so , he is much to be pitied and we are wrong to speak of him so . A DANCER  --  I do not pity him . I am afraid of him . A GENTLEMAN  --  That is foolish . It is the sun which beats down so fiercely which makes you have such thoughts . I , also , have been afraid of him at times , but I know now that I had been gazing at the sea too long and listening to the great silence . Such things distort your brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear him ? A GENTLEMAN  --  I no longer fear him now that I am quite sane . It clears my brain to talk to you . We must talk to each other all the time . A DANCER  --  Yes , we must talk to each other . I do not dream when I talk to you . A GENTLEMAN  --  I think at one time I was going mad . I dreamed he had a knife in his hand and looked at me . But it was all madness ; I can see that now . He is only a poor negro sailor  --  our companion in misfortune . God knows we are all in the same pitiful plight . We should not grow suspicious of one another . A DANCER  --  All the same , I am afraid of him . There is something in his eyes when he looks at me , which makes me tremble . A GENTLEMAN  --  There is nothing I tell you . It is all your imagination . ( There is a long pause . ) A DANCER  --  Good God ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( attempting to rise but falling back weakly ) I can see none . And I can not stand to get a wider view . A DANCER  --  ( pointing to the negro ) Ask him . He is stronger than we are . He may be able to see one . p. 10 A GENTLEMAN  --  Sailor ! ( The negro ceases his chant and turns to him with expressionless eyes . ) You are stronger than we are and can see farther . Stand up and tell me if there is any ship in sight . A WEST INDIAN MULATTO SAILOR  --  ( rising slowly to his feet and looking at all points of the horizon ) No . There is none . ( He sits down again and croons his dreary melody . ) A DANCER  --  ( weeping hopelessly ) My God , this is horrible . To wait and wait for something that never comes . A GENTLEMAN  --  It is indeed horrible . But it is to be expected . A DANCER  --  Why do you say it is to be expected ? Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A GENTLEMAN  --  ( wearily ) I have hoped for many things in my life . Always I have hoped in vain . We are far out of the beaten track of steamers . I know little of navigation , yet I heard those on board say that we were following a course but little used . Why we did so , I do not know . I suppose the Captain wished to make a quicker passage . He alone knows what was in his mind and he will probably never tell . A DANCER  --  No , he will never tell . p. 11 A GENTLEMAN  --  Why do you speak so decidedly ? He might have been among those who escaped in the boats . A DANCER  --  He did not escape . He is dead ! A GENTLEMAN  --  Dead ? A DANCER  --  Yes . He was on the bridge . I can remember seeing his face as he stood in under a lamp . It was pale and drawn like the face of a dead man . His eyes , too , seemed dead . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one paid any attention to him . And then he shot himself . I saw the flash , and heard the report above all the screams of the drowning . Some one grasped me by the arm and I heard a hoarse voice shouting in my ear . Then I fainted . A GENTLEMAN  --  Poor Captain ! It is evident , then , that he felt himself guilty  --  since he killed himself . It must be terrible to hear the screams of the dying and know oneself to blame . I do not wonder that he killed himself . A DANCER  --  He was so kind and good-natured  --  the Captain . It was only that afternoon on the promenade deck that he stopped beside my chair . " I hear you are to entertain us this evening " he said . " That will be delightful , and it is very kind of you . I had promised myself the pleasure of seeing you in New York , but you have forestalled me. " ( after a pause ) How handsome and broad-shouldered he was  --  the Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have seen his soul . A DANCER  --  You would have found it no better and no worse than the souls of other men . If he was guilty he has paid with his life . A GENTLEMAN  --  No . He has avoided payment by taking his life . The dead do not pay . A DANCER  --  And the dead can not answer when we speak evil of them . All we can know is that he is dead . Let us talk of other things . ( There is a pause . ) A GENTLEMAN  --  ( fumbles in the inside pocket of his dress coat and pulls out a black object that looks like a large card case . He opens it and stares at it with perplexed eyes . Then , giving a hollow laugh , he holds it over for the Dancer to see . ) Oh , the damned irony of it ! A DANCER  --  What is it ? I can not read very well . My eyes ache so . A GENTLEMAN  --  ( still laughing mockingly ) Bend closer ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke that has been played on me . A DANCER  --  ( reading slowly , her face almost touching the case ) United States Club of Buenos Aires ! I do not understand what the joke is. p. 13 A GENTLEMAN  --  ( impatiently snatching the case from her hand ) I will explain the joke to you then . Listen ! M-e-n-u  --  menu . That is the joke . This is a souvenir menu of a banquet given in my honor by this Club . ( reading ) " Martini cocktails , soup , sherry , fish , Burgundy , chicken , champagne "  --  and here we are dying for a crust of bread , for a drink of water ! ( His mad laughter suddenly ceases and in a frenzy of rage he shakes his fist at the sky and screams ) God ! God ! What a joke to play on us ! ( After this outburst he sinks back dejectedly , his trembling hand still clutching the menu . ) A DANCER  --  ( sobbing ) This is too horrible . What have we done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one misfortune after another happened to make our agony more terrible . Throw that thing away ! The very sight of it is a mockery . ( The Gentleman throws the menu into the sea where it floats , a black spot on the glassy water . ) How do you happen to have that thing with you ? It is ghastly for you to torment me by reading it . A GENTLEMAN  --  I am sorry to have hurt you . The jest was so grotesque I could not keep it to myself . You ask how I happen to have it with me ? I will tell you . It gives the joke an even bitterer flavor . You remember when the crash came ? We were all in the salon . You were singing  --  a Cockney song I think ? p. 14 A DANCER  --  Yes . It is one I first sang at the Palace in London . A GENTLEMAN  --  It was in the salon . You were singing . You were very beautiful . I remember a woman on my right saying : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married ? " Strange how some idiotic remark like that will stick in one 's brain when all else is vague and confused . A tragedy happens  --  we are in the midst of it  --  and one of our clearest remembrances afterwards is a remark that might have been overheard in any subway train . A DANCER  --  It is so with me . There was a fat , bald headed , little man . It was on deck after the crash . Everywhere they were fighting to get into the boats . This poor little man stood by himself . His moon face was convulsed with rage . He kept repeating in loud angry tones : " I shall be late . I must cable ! I can never make it ! " He was still bewailing his broken appointment when a rush of the crowd swept him off his feet and into the sea . I can see him now . He is the only person besides the Captain I remember clearly . A GENTLEMAN  --  ( continuing his story in a dead voice ) You were very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of a woman you were . You know I had never met you personally  --  only seen you in my walks around the deck . Then came the crash  --  that horrible dull crash . We were all thrown forward on the floor of the salon ; then screams , oaths , fainting women , the hollow boom of a bulkhead giving way . I vaguely remember rushing to my stateroom and picking up my wallet . It must have been that menu that I took instead . Then I was on deck fighting in the midst of the crowd . Somehow I got into a boat  --  but it was overloaded and was swamped immediately . I swam to another boat . They beat me off with the oars . That boat too was swamped a moment later . And then the gurgling , choking cries of the drowning ! Something huge rushed by me in the water leaving a gleaming trail of phosphorescence . A woman near me with a life belt around her gave a cry of agony and disappeared  --  then I realized  --  sharks ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat the water with my hands . The ship had gone down . I swam and swam with but one idea  --  to put all that horror behind me . I saw something white on the water before me . I clutched it  --  climbed on it . It was this raft . You and he were on it . I fainted . The whole thing is a horrible nightmare in my brain  --  but I remember clearly that idiotic remark of the woman in the salon . What pitiful creatures we are ! p. 15 A DANCER  --  When the crash came I also rushed to my stateroom . I took this , ( pointing to the diamond necklace ) clasped it round my neck and ran on deck ; the rest I have told you . A GENTLEMAN  --  Do you not remember how you came on this raft ? It is strange that you and he should be on a raft alone when so many died for lack of a place . Were there ever any others on the raft with you ? A DANCER  --  No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory is blurred . But I feel sure we were always the only one  --  until you came . I was afraid of you  --  your face was livid with fear . You were moaning to yourself . A GENTLEMAN  --  It was the sharks . Until they came I kept a half-control over myself . But when I saw them even my soul quivered with terror . A DANCER  --  ( horror-stricken , looking at the circling fins ) Sharks ! Why they are all around us now . ( frenziedly ) You lied to me . You said they would not touch us . Oh , I am afraid , I am afraid ! ( She covers her face with her hands . ) A GENTLEMAN  --  If I lied to you it was because I wished to spare you . Be brave ! We are safe from them as long as we stay on the raft . These things must be faced . ( then in tones of utter despondency ) Besides , what does it matter ?  --  sharks or no sharks  --  the end is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands away from her eyes and looking dully at the water ) You are right . What does it matter ? A GENTLEMAN  --  God ! How still the sea is ! How still the sky is ! One would say the world was dead . I think the accursed humming of that nigger only makes one feel the silence more keenly . There is nothing  --  but the sharks  --  that seems to live . A DANCER  --  How the sun burns into me ! ( piteously ) My poor skin that I was once so proud of ! A GENTLEMAN  --  ( rousing himself with an effort ) Come ! Let us not think about it . It is madness to think about it so . How do you account for your being on the raft alone with this nigger ? You have not yet told me . A DANCER  --  How can I tell ? The last thing I remember was that harsh voice in my ear shouting something  --  what , I can not recollect . A GENTLEMAN  --  There was nothing else ? A DANCER  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something I had forgotten . I think that someone kissed me . Yes , I am sure that someone kissed me . But no , I am not sure . It may have all been a dream I dreamed . I have had so many dreams during these awful days and nights  --  so many mad , mad dreams . ( Her eyes begin to glaze , her lips to twitch . She murmurs to herself ) Mad , mad dreams . p. 17 A GENTLEMAN  --  ( reaching over and shaking her by the shoulder ) Come ! You said someone kissed you . You must be mistaken . I surely did not , and it could hardly have been that sailor . A DANCER  --  Yet I am sure someone did . It was not since I have been on this raft . It was on the deck of the ship just as I was fainting . A GENTLEMAN  --  Who could it have been , do you think ? A DANCER  --  I hardly dare to say what I think . I might be wrong . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great dark eyes who was so tall and handsome ? All the women loved him . I , too , I loved him  --  a little bit . He loved me  --  very much  --  so he said . Yes , I know he loved me very much . I think it was he who kissed me . I am almost sure it was he . A GENTLEMAN  --  Yes , he must have been the one . That would explain it all . He must have sent away the raft when only you and this sailor were on it . He probably did not let the others know of the existence of this raft . Indeed he must have loved you to disregard his duty so . I will ask the sailor about it . Maybe he can clear away our doubts . ( to the negro ) Sailor ! ( The negro stops singing and looks at them with wide , blood-shot eyes . ) Did the Second Officer order you to take this lady away from the ship ? p. 18 A WEST INDIAN MULATTO SAILOR  --  ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did he tell you to take no one else with you but this lady  --  and perhaps himself afterwards ? A WEST INDIAN MULATTO SAILOR  --  ( angrily ) I do not know . ( He turns away again and commences to sing . ) A DANCER  --  Do not speak to him any more . He is angry at something . He will not answer . A GENTLEMAN  --  He is going mad I think . However it seems certain that it was the Second Officer who kissed you and saved your life . A DANCER  --  He was kind and brave to me . He meant well . Yet I wish now he had let me die . I would have been way down in the cold green water . I would have been sleeping , coldly sleeping . While now my brain is scorched with sun-fire and dream-fire . And I am going mad . We are all going mad . Your eyes shine with a wild flame at times  --  and that Sailor 's are horrible with strangeness  --  and mine see great drops of blood that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( pause ) God ! Oh God ! Must this be the end of all ? I was coming home , home after years of struggling , home to success and fame and money . And I must die out here on a raft like a mad dog . ( She weeps despairingly. ) p. 19 A GENTLEMAN  --  Be still ! You must not despair so . I , too , might whine a prayer of protest : " Oh God , God ! After twenty years of incessant grind , day after weary day , I started on my first vacation . I was going home . And here I sit dying by slow degrees , desolate and forsaken . Is this the meaning of all my years of labor ? Is this the end , oh God ? " So I might wail with equal justice . But the blind sky will not answer your appeals or mine . Nor will the cruel sea grow merciful for any prayer of ours . A DANCER  --  Have you no hope that one of the ship 's boats may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely send steamers out to search for the other survivors . A GENTLEMAN  --  We have drifted far , very far , in these long weary days . I am afraid no steamer would find us . A DANCER  --  We are lost then ! ( She falls face downward on the raft . A great sob shakes her thin bare shoulders . ) A GENTLEMAN  --  I have not given up hope . These seas , I have heard , are full of coral islands and we surely ought to drift near one of them soon . It was probably an uncharted coral reef that our steamer hit . I heard someone say " derelict " but I saw no sign of one in the water . With us it is only a question of whether we can hold out until we sight land . ( His voice quivers ; he licks his blackened lips . His eyes have grown very mad and he is shaking spasmodically from head to foot . ) Water would save us  --  just a little water  --  even a few drops would be enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little water ! p. 20 A DANCER  --  Perhaps there will be water on the island . Look ; look hard ! An island or a ship may have come in sight while we were talking . ( There is a pause . Suddenly she rises to her knees and pointing straight in front of her shouts ) See ! An island ! A GENTLEMAN  --  ( shading his eyes with a trembling hand and peering wildly around him ) I see nothing  --  nothing but a red sea and a red sky . A DANCER  --  ( still looking at some point far out over the water , speaks in disappointed tones ) It is gone . Yet I am quite sure I saw one . It was right out there quite near to us . It was all green and clean looking with a clear stream that ran into the sea . I could hear the water running over the stones . You do not believe me . You , Sailor , you must have seen it too , did you not ? ( The negro does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet I must see it . I will see it ! A GENTLEMAN  --  ( shaking her by the shoulder ) What you say is nonsense . There is no island there I tell you . There is nothing but sun and sky and sea around us . There are no green trees . There is no water . ( The Sailor has stopped singing and turns and looks at them. ) p. 21 A DANCER  --  ( angrily ) Do you mean to tell me I lie ? Can I not believe my own eyes , then ? I tell you I saw it  --  cool clear water . I heard it bubbling over the stones . But now I hear nothing , nothing at all . ( turning suddenly to the Sailor ) Why have you stopped singing ? Is not everything awful enough already that you should make it worse ? A WEST INDIAN MULATTO SAILOR  --  ( stieking out his swollen tongue and pointing to it with a long , brown finger ) Water ! I want water ! Give me some water and I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no water , fool ! It is your fault we have none . Why did you drink all that was left in the cask when you thought we were asleep ? I would not give you any even if we had some . You deserve to suffer , you pig ! If anyone of the three of us has any water it is you who have hidden some out of what you stole . ( with a laugh of mad cunning ) But you will get no chance to drink it , I promise you that . I am watching you . ( The negro sullenly turns away from them . ) A DANCER  --  ( taking hold of the Gentleman 's arm and almost hissing into his ear . She is terribly excited and he is still chuckling crazily to himself . ) Do you really think he has some ? p. 22 A GENTLEMAN  --  ( chuckling ) He may have . He may have . A DANCER  --  Why do you say that ? A GENTLEMAN  --  He has been acting strangely . He has looked as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could be . Then suddenly I thought to myself : " What if it should be some of the water ? " Then I knew I had found him out . I will not let him get the best of me . I will watch him . He will not drink while I am watching him . I will watch him as long as I can see . A DANCER  --  What could he have put the water in ? He has nothing that I can discover . ( She is rapidly falling in with this mad fixed idea of his . ) A GENTLEMAN  --  Who knows ? He may have a flask hidden in under his jersey . But he has something , that I am sure of . Why is it he is so much stronger than we are ? He can stand up without effort and we can scarcely move . Why is that , I ask you ? A DANCER  --  It is true . He stood up and looked for a ship as easily as if he had never known hunger and thirst . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food or water . A GENTLEMAN  --  ( with mad eagerness to prove his fixed idea ) No , he has no food . There has never been any food . But there has been water . There was a whole small cask full of it on the raft when I came . On the second or third night , I do not remember which , I awoke and saw him draining the cask . When I reached it , it was empty . ( furiously shaking his fist at the negro 's back ) Oh you pig ! You rotten pig ! ( The negro does not seem to hear. ) p. 23 A DANCER  --  That water would have saved our lives . He is no better than a murderer . A GENTLEMAN  --  ( with insane shrewdness ) Listen . I think he must have poured some of the water into his flask . There was quite a little there . He could not have drunk it all . Oh , he is a cunning one ! That song of his  --  it was only a blind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will drink no more for I will watch him . I will watch him ! A DANCER  --  You will watch him ? And what good will that do either of us ? Will we die any the less soon for your watching ? No ! Let us get the water away from him in some way . That is the only thing to do . A GENTLEMAN  --  He will not give it to us . A DANCER  --  We will steal it while he sleeps . A GENTLEMAN  --  I do not think he sleeps . I have never seen him sleep . Besides we should wake him . A DANCER  --  ( violently ) We will kill him then . He deserves to be killed . A GENTLEMAN  --  He is stronger than we are  --  and he has a knife . No , we can not do that . I would willingly kill him . As you say , he deserves it . But I can not even stand . I have no strength left . I have no weapons . He would laugh at me. p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You would think even the most heartless savage would share at a time like this . We must get that water . It is horrible to be dying of thirst with water so near . Think ! Think ! Is there no way ? A GENTLEMAN  --  You might buy it from him with that necklace of yours . I have heard his people are very fond of such things . A DANCER  --  This necklace ? It is worth a thousand pounds . An English duke gave it to me . I will not part with it . Do you think I am a fool ? A GENTLEMAN  --  Think of a drink of water ! ( They both lick their dry lips feverishly . ) If we do not drink soon we will die . ( laughing harshly ) You will take your necklace to the sharks with you ? Very well then , I will say no more . For my part , I would sell my soul for a drop of water . A DANCER  --  ( Shuddering with horror she glances instinctively at the moving shark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten those monsters . It is not kind of you to be always bringing them back to my memory . A GENTLEMAN  --  It is well that you should not forget them . You will value your Duke 's present less when you look at them . ( impatiently pounding the deck with one boney hand ) Come , come , we shall both die of thirst while you are dreaming . Offer it to him ! Offer it to him ! p. 25 A DANCER  --  ( She takes off the necklace and , musing vacantly , turns it over in her hands watching it sparkle in the sun . ) It is beautiful , is it not ? I hate to part with it . He was very much in love with me  --  the old Duke . I think he would even have married me in the end . I did not like him . He was old , very old . Something came up  --  I forget what . I never saw him again . This is the only gift of his that I have left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vision of the water clear before his glaring eyes ) Damn it , why are you chattering so ? Think of the water he has got . Offer it to him ! Offer it to him ! A DANCER  --  Yes , yes , my throat is burning up ; my eyes are on fire . I must have the water . ( She drags herself on hands and knees across the raft to where the negro is sitting . He does not notice her approach . She reaches out a trembling hand and touches him on the back . He turns slowly and looks at her , his round , animal eyes dull and lusterless . She holds the necklace out in her right hand before his face and speaks hurriedly in a husky voice . ) Look , you have stolen our water . You deserve to be killed . We will forget all that . Look at this necklace . It was given to me by an English Duke  --  a nobleman . It is worth a thousand pounds  --  five thousand dollars . It will provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need not be a sailor any more . You need never work at all any more . Do you understand what that means ? ( The negro does not answer . The Dancer hurries on however , her words pouring out in a sing-song jumble . ) That water that you stole  --  well , I will give you this necklace  --  they are all real diamonds , you know  --  five thousand dollars  --  for that water . You need not give me all of it . I am not unreasonable . You may keep some for yourself . I would not have you die . I want just enough for myself and my friend  --  to keep us alive until we reach some island . My lips are cracked with heat ! My head is bursting ! Here , take the necklace . It is yours . ( She tries to force it into his hand . He pushes her hand away and the necklace falls to the deck of the raft where it lies glittering among the heat waves. ) p. 26 A DANCER  --  ( her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given you the necklace . Give me the water ! A GENTLEMAN  --  ( who has been watching her with anxious eyes , also cries ) Yes . Give her the water ! A WEST INDIAN MULATTO SAILOR  --  ( his voice drawling and without expression ) I have no water . A DANCER  --  Oh , you are cruel ! Why do you lie ? You see me suffering so and yet you lie to me . I have given you the necklace . It is worth five thousand dollars , do you understand ? Surely for five thousand dollars you will give me a drink of water ! A WEST INDIAN MULATTO SAILOR  --  I have no water , I tell you . ( He turns his back to her . She crawls over to the Gentleman and lies beside him , sobbing brokenly . ) A GENTLEMAN  --  ( his face convulsed with rage , shaking both fists in the air ) The pig ! The pig ! The black dog ! A DANCER  --  ( sitting up and wiping her eyes ) Well , you have heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe he only has a little and is afraid to share it . What shall we do now ? What can we do ? p. 27 A GENTLEMAN  --  ( despondently ) Nothing . He is stronger than we are . There is no wind . We will never reach an island . We can die , that is all . ( He sinks back and buries his head in his hands . A great dry sob shakes his shoulders . ) A DANCER  --  ( her eyes flaming with a sudden resolution ) Ah , who is the coward now ? You have given up hope , it seems . Well , I have not . I have still one chance . It has never failed me yet . A GENTLEMAN  --  ( raising his head and looking at her in amazement ) You are going to offer him more money ? A DANCER  --  ( with a strange smile ) No . Not that . I will offer more than money . We shall get our water . ( She tears a piece of crumpled lace off the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if she were using a powder-puff . ) A GENTLEMAN  --  ( watching her stupidly ) I do not understand . A DANCER  --  ( She pulls up her stockings  --  tries to smooth the wrinkles out of her dress  --  then takes her long hair and having braided it , winds it into a coil around her head . She pinches her cheeks , already crimson with sunburn . Then turning coquettishly to the Gentleman , she says ) There ! Do I not look better ? How do I look ? p. 28 A GENTLEMAN  --  ( bursting into a mad guffaw ) You look terrible ! You are hideous ! A DANCER  --  You lie ! I am beautiful . Everyone knows I am beautiful . You yourself have said so . It is you who are hideous . You are jealous of me . I will not give you any water . A GENTLEMAN  --  You will get no water . You are frightful . What is it you would do  --  dance for him ? ( mockingly ) Dance ! Dance Salome ! I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will both applaud you madly . ( He leans on one elbow and watches her , chuckling to himself . ) A DANCER  --  ( turning from him furiously and crawling on her knees over to the Sailor , calls in her most seductive voice ) Sailor ! Sailor ! ( He does not seem to hear  --  she takes his arm and shakes it gently  --  he turns around and stares wonderingly at her . ) Listen to me , Sailor . What is your name  --  your first name ? ( She smiles enticingly at him . He does not answer . ) You will not tell me then ? You are angry at me , are you not ? I can not blame you . I have called you bad names . I am sorry , very sorry . ( indicating the Gentleman who has ceased to notice them and is staring at the horizon with blinking eyes ) It was he who put such ideas into my head . He does not like you . Neither did I , but I see now that you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has said dreadful things which I can not forgive . ( Putting her hand on his shoulder she bends forward with her golden hair almost in his lap and smiles up into his face . ) I like you , Sailor . You are big and strong . We are going to be great friends , are we not ? ( The negro is hardly looking at her . He is watching the sharks . ) Surely you will not refuse me a little sip of your water ? p. 29 A WEST INDIAN MULATTO SAILOR  --  I have no water . A DANCER  --  Oh , why will you keep up this subterfuge ? Am I not offering you price enough ? ( putting her arm around his neck and half whispering in his ear ) Do you not understand ? I will love you , Sailor ! Noblemen and millionaires and all degrees of gentleman have loved me , have fought for me . I have never loved any of them as I will love you . Look in my eyes , Sailor , look in my eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her voice , the negro gazes deep into her eyes . For a second his nostrils dilate  --  he draws in his breath with a hissing sound  --  his body grows tense and it seems as if he is about to sweep her into his arms . Then his expression grows apathetic again . He turns to the sharks . ) A DANCER  --  Oh , will you never understand ? Are you so stupid that you do not know what I mean ? Look ! I am offering myself to you ! I am kneeling before you  --  I who always had men kneel to me ! I am offering my body to you  --  my body that men have called so beautiful . I have promised to love you  --  a negro sailor  --  if you will give me one small drink of water . Is that not humiliation enough that you must keep me waiting so ? ( raising her voice ) Answer me ! Answer me ! Will you give me that water ? p. 30 A WEST INDIAN MULATTO SAILOR  --  ( without even turning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DANCER  --  ( shaking with fury ) Great God , have I abased myself for this ? Have I humbled myself before this black animal only to be spurned like a wench of the streets . It is too much ! You lie , you dirty slave ! You have water . You have stolen my share of the water . ( In a frenzy she clutches the Sailor about the throat with both hands . ) Give it to me ! Give it to me ! A WEST INDIAN MULATTO SAILOR  --  ( takes her hands from his neck and pushes her roughly away . She falls face downward in the middle of the raft . ) Let me alone ! I have no water . A GENTLEMAN  --  ( aroused from the stupor he has been in ) What is it ? I was dreaming I was sitting before great tumblers of ice-water . They were just beyond my reach . I tried and tried to get one of them . It was horrible . But what has happened here ? What is the matter ? ( No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Dancer is lying in a huddled heap , moaning to herself . Suddenly she jumps to her feet . All her former weakness seems quite gone . She stands swaying a little with the roll of the raft . Her eyes have a terrible glare in them . They seem bursting out of her head . She mutters incoherently to herself . The last string has snapped . She is mad. ) p. 31 A DANCER  --  ( smoothing her dress over her hips and looking before her as if in a mirror ) Quick , Marie ! You are so slow to night . I will be late . Did you not hear the bell ? I am the next on . Did he send any flowers to-night , Marie ? Good , he will be in a stage box . I will smile at him , the poor old fool . He will marry me some day and I will be a Duchess . Think of that Marie  --  a real Duchess ! Yes , yes I am coming ! You need not hold the curtain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to herself . The Gentleman has been watching her , at first in astonishment , then in a sort of crazy appreciation . When she stops talking he claps his hands . ) A GENTLEMAN  --  Go on ! Go on ! It is as good as a play . ( He bursts into cackling laughter . ) A DANCER  --  They are laughing . It can not be at me . How hot it is ! How the footlights glare ! I shall be glad to get away to-night . I am very thirsty . ( passing her hand across her eyes ) There he is in the box  --  the poor , old duke . I will wave to him . ( She waves her hand in the air . ) He is kind to me . It is a pity he is so old . What song is it I am to sing ? Oh yes . ( She sings the last few lines of some music hall ballad in a harsh cracked voice . The negro turns and looks at her wonderingly . The Gentleman claps his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them ! ( She commences to dance on the swaying surface of the raft , half-stumbling every now and then . Her hair falls down . She is like some ghastly marionette jerked by invisible wires . She dances faster and faster . Her arms and legs fly grotesquely around as if beyond control . ) Oh , how hot it is ! ( She grasps the front of her bodice in both hands and rips it over her shoulders . It hangs down in back . She is almost naked to the waist . Her breasts are withered and shrunken by starvation . She kicks first one foot and then the other frenziedly in the air . ) Oh it is hot ! I am stifling . Bring me a drink of water ! I am choking ! ( She falls back on the raft . A shudder runs over her whole body . A little crimson foam appears on her lips . Her eyes glaze . The wild stare leaves them . She is dead. ) p. 32 A GENTLEMAN  --  ( laughing insanely and clapping his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( There is no answer . A great stillness hangs over everything . The heat waves rising from the raft near the woman 's body seem like her soul departing into the great unknown . A look of fear appears on the Gentleman 's face . The negro wears a strange expression . One might say he looked relieved , even glad , as if some perplexing problem has been solved for him . ) A GENTLEMAN  --  She does not answer me . She must be sick . ( He crawls over to her . ) She has fainted . ( He puts his hand on her left breast  --  then bends and rests his ear over her heart . His face grows livid in spite of the sunburn . ) My God ! She is dead ! Poor girl ! Poor Girl ! ( He whimpers weakly to himself , mechanically running her long golden hair through his fingers with a caressing gesture . He is startled when he hears the negro 's voice . ) A WEST INDIAN MULATTO SAILOR  --  Is she dead ? A GENTLEMAN  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart no longer beats . A WEST INDIAN MULATTO SAILOR  --  She is better off . She does not suffer now . One of us had to die . ( after a pause ) It is lucky for us she is dead . p. 33 A GENTLEMAN  --  What do you mean ? What good can her death do us ? A WEST INDIAN MULATTO SAILOR  --  We will live now . ( He takes his sailor 's knife from its sheath and sharpens it on the sole of his shoe . While he is doing this he sings  --  a happy negro melody that mocks the great silence . ) A GENTLEMAN  --  ( in hushed , frightened tones ) I do not understand . A WEST INDIAN MULATTO SAILOR  --  ( his swollen lips parting in a grin as he points with his knife to the body of the Dancer ) We shall eat . We shall drink . A GENTLEMAN  --  ( for a moment struck dumb with loathing  --  then in tones of anguished horror ) No ! No ! No ! Good God , not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's body with both hands and making a tremendous effort , pushes it into the water . There is a swift rush of waiting fins . The sea near the raft is churned into foam . The Dancer 's body disappears in a swirling eddy ; then all is quiet again . A black stain appears on the surface of the water . ) The Sailor , who has jumped forward to save the body , gives a harsh cry of disappointed rage and , knife in hand , springs on the Gentleman and drives the knife in his breast . The Gentleman rises to his feet with a shriek of agony . As he falls backward into the sea , one of his clutching hands fastens itself in the neck of the Sailor 's jersey . The Sailor tries to force the hand away , stumbles , loses his balance , and plunges headlong after him . There is a great splash . The waiting fins rush in . The water is lashed into foam . The Sailor 's black head appears for a moment , his features distorted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he is drawn under . The black stain on the water widens . The fins circle no longer . The raft floats in the midst of a vast silence . The sun glares down like a great angry eye of God . The eerie heat waves float upward in the still air like the souls of the drowned . On the raft a diamond necklace lies glittering in the blazing sunshine .
