As the food administration has no authority to fine the dealers , the contributions were mostly " voluntary , " but the majority of them were made after Mr. Wheeler had pointed out the difference between What Mr. Hoover wanted and what the dealers had done . " We have been heading In everything we could for the Red Cross , " said Mr. Wheeler last night " In many cases the collections were not a line , but followed a violation of the strict regulations that govern sales of flour . " Last January the food administration issued an order limiting allotments of flour to dealers to 70 per cent of what they handled one year ago . Some of the dealers were able to get more than this . We called these dealers In this afternoon and asked them to give the profits on what they had sold above the 70 per cent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 40,000 barrels . They put the matter up to me as to how much they should pay , and I suggested that they make a donation amounting to 25 cents a barrel . " In addition , we sent $1,500 to the Red Cross . This represented profits on the sale of flour we bad seized because it was being shipped out of the state . "
