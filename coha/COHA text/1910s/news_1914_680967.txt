txt The combination of bidders which took $51.000.000 of bonds from the State at 106.077 on Wednesday resold them all on Thursday at 107.25 , or 107. ' 25 less ' 4 to dealers . They will not even ha ve to pay for them . Evidently this combination was nut in restraint of investment . but it was a combination . in effect it cornered the market . since it secured all there ' here . and there was no other of supply . However , it was aa5 benevolent combination , as its moderate profit of $50,000 between two nights shows , but in disposing of its bargain it fixed discriminating prices , and further fixed a minimum below which it is unlikely that the bonds will be sold within any reasonable period or under any probable conditions . For our part this seems an operation reflecting the astuteness of the combination , and highly beneficial in a public sense . The double sale of $51,000,000 bonds , $102,000,000 of bonds on two successive days , may well prove to be a dating point in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Europe has lately been in the habit of abstaining from the first offering , and taking the same securities at a lower figure within the next few days from the overloaded original subscribers disappointed in the resale . There can be no such result in this case . The money which was offered to the State has already been released on a rising market . The same funds are now even more liquid , and at the use of the market If the bonds had not been sold there would have been that considerable amount of bankers ' money put into bonds , good , to be sure , but tied up . The second buyers are savings banks , whose January receipts have been exceptionally large this year , and other financial institutions , like insurance companies . The bonds seem sold to stay , sold into hands which in some cases will not part with them until maturity . Reassuring as these facts are in a general sense , it seems that a word of caution is timely to borrowers . As these are fifty-year ** the interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the charge against the State will be nearly $115,000,000 . The money will be spent on roads and canals , some of it , possibly , in a manner which it is painful to recall . This week there has turned up a bill of canal damage claims to a total of $64,000,000 . This was not included in the original estimates , and there are further incidentals in the form of expensive terminals , to stint which would be to cripple the canal . Under any condition it is wearying to pay taxes for graft and waste and mismanagement It is not too much to say that no private enterprise showing the same record as the State as a spender could borrow except on exorbitant terms . Even the State can not borrow cheaply . No longer ago than 1003 and 1909 the State could borrow at approximately 3 per cent. , which would make a total to redemption of $76,500,000 instead of $115,000,000 . The difference is a caution to the State regarding the path it is taking . The swelling tax bill reflects these facts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it Certainly should cause them to think seriously of what they are allowing to be done . ? No longer ago than 1893 the debt of the State was merely $660 . It had passed $100,000,000 before this issue of $51,000.000 . The present authorized indebtedness is $220,000,000 . There is sure to be an addition of $100,000,000 or more , even if there are no more regrettable additions . As the Republican leader of the Assembly figures it , this is equivalent on the present basis to a 2 per cent mortgage on , all the property in the State , say a $100 mortgage on a $5,000 farm . The farm will yield nothing more to pay the mortgage . The canals and highways , beneficial its they will be , will not return ben &its; in cash , while-the present maintenance of eanala-Will-cho-dtinbled , or mill be ** financial condition burdensome for both citizens and the State . Even though it seems impossible that the State 's credit ever Should be tarnished so as to cast the least doubt ' 9 regarding the exact fulfillment of its engagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to pay so much for its money that the glamour of the expenditure will be dimmed . In the five years 1906-1911 the State had no need to levy anY direct tax . The recurrence of that happy condition is thrown indefinitely into the future , and the city 's resentment of the undue share of the State tax cast upon the city may cause a revision of the tax payments by the State outside the city . Fortunately the Governor and the Controller are alive to the situation . The issuance of the loan is calculated to lend weight to their efforts to control the State 's budget , which is even less manageable than the State 's debt
