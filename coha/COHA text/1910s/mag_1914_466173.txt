Kashmiri 's home is his castle . Its drawbridge has seldom been lowered to admit a foreigner . Behind the massive gates lives a world that fires the Western imagination . Here wives , daughters , and mothers drag out a dreary existence . In the Happy Valley a man maintains as many wives as his purse will allow . If his goats ' wool be unusually profitable , if the London or New York market give large orders for soft Kashmir shawls , or the trade in carved wood and brass howls leave him a heavy bag of silver at the end of the season , instead of squandering his savings on material luxuries he acquires another wife , and so adds to his prestige in the community . His household of women thus appears to him as an index of his prosperity , to be managed and admired , and especially to be kept in seclusion according to historic custom . And the Kashmiri has good reason to be proud of his women . They are the most beautiful of Oriental beauties . Travelers who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes behind latticed windows , of graceful figures disappearing into doorways , of gay laughter and melodious singing from the interior of impenetrable houses ? but here the story always ends . Occasionally one of the higher class Kashmiri will invite a Westerner , perhaps even a Western woman , to drink tea and eat honey in the outer rooms of his house , but to have even his No. r wife share in this hospitality never crosses his Oriental mind . Sometimes , however , the drawbridge is lowered by other than the master 's hand . It was lowered for me by the wife of a village official , far up among the Himalaya Mountains , many miles from the sound of the steam-engine and the rattle of the trolley-cars . The Happy Valley is no easy place to reach . It is a month 's journey from London , a hard ten days ' trip from Bombay , and even then the expedition can only be made during the warmer months of the year . The most traveled road from India to the hills begins at Rawal Pindi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends two-hundred miles inland at Srinagar , the capital of Kashmir . The journey is made in a sort of two-wheeled covered tip-cart , or tonga , drawn by a pair of wild mountain ponies that tear along at a full gallop over the winding road . At relay stations , placed every six miles along the way , fresh horses are substituted for the winded little beasts that draw up panting at the end of their quota of running . The change occupies only two or three minutes , when the tonga is off again at full speed . The trip into Kashmir is exciting all the way . The road follows the banks of the Jhelum River , sometimes close to the tumbling waters , sometimes high up along cliff banks , with precipitous rocks above and deep declivities below . Rushing along at top speed , up hilt and down , round sharp corners and along level stretches , is an experience one does not soon forget . The swiftly moving landscape is like a sort of moving-picture film , and the miles and minutes slip rapidly by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardened traveler , and one is glad enough at dusk to stop for the night at one of the government rest-houses built at intervals beside the highway , where shelter may be had of a more or less primitive kind . For three long days one rolls along the way . At noon on the fourth , weary and stiff , travel-stained and dusty , one reaches Srinagar , in the very heart of the Happy Valley . My husband and I had come to Kashmir to hunt big game and to explore by ourselves some of the unbeaten paths through the Himalaya ranges . Srinagar was to be our starting-point , and we were keen to get off and feel " fresh air astir to win'ard . " But this was no easy task . There were servants to choose from a motley crowd that hung about the hotel , each applicant the possessor of glowing letters of recommendation , or chits , from his previous employers ; there were ponies to try our ; a camp outfit to acquire , with food-supplies , guns , and many other accessories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay , we mounted our little native ponies and started forth at the head of our caravan . Close at our heels rode our head-man , a tall , black-bearded Kashmiri , astride a ratty little mountain horse , and behind came our entire retinue of about forty followers in a long , irregular string . It was an imposing sight . Conspicuous among the company was our Indian hearer , Mohammed Rajoo by name , an acquisition from Calcutta , who strode along under a huge black-cotton umbrella . Then came our ten permanent camp servants , turbaned but shoeless , and behind these twenty-odd Kashmiri coolies straggled and loafed along , loaded with tents , folding-beds , chairs , tables , boxes , hags , food ? even a tin bath-tub was firmly strapped to the back of one stalwart youth . Nor was this all . Chickens were tied to thetops of some of the lighter coolie loads . A much-ruffled , squawking duck fluttered in the hands of our cook as he shuffled ahead ; and last , but not least , two bleating sheep brought up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to come . And so we marched ten long miles , passing through little villages of mud huts covered with thatch , fording streams , and picking our way along nar-row ridges between rice-fields . At noon we rested for an hour under a huge chenar , or spreading nut-tree , and then started on again for another five miles . Toward dusk we stopped for the night , pitching camp on the outskirts of a little walled-in village . A bath , a rub , dinner served at a little table set on the grass in front of our tent , an hour spent by a hig bonfire , talking over the events of the past twenty-four hours , and we turned in for the night . Thus ended the first day ; and the second was just like the first , and the third like the second , and so on for many weeks . Each morning we started forth with the dawn , traveling on pony-hack or on foot , and at night pitching camp near some native village . As soon as our tents were up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a coarse gray Kashmir shawl , squatted on the ground about our camp , absorbed in watching a sahib and his memsahib eating and sitting about . Much to our disappointment , no women joined even their husbands or brothers . We often saw them at a distance in their loose garments , but when we drew near they always ran off into the houses or hid behind bushes at the roadside . Even the little girls seemed terrified at the sight of us , and never came ? within yards of our dread presence . The fame of the Kashmir women had been drummed into our ears , and our desire to see and photograph some of them grew as the difficulties increased . All attempts to get near to them had been fruitless . The sight of the sahib was invariably a signal for instantaneous flight . For three weeks we wandered . Srinagar was now some two hundred miles behind when we pitched camp one night , on the eve or the Mohammedan New-Year , near the ruins of Martand Temple . This anniversary is always the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the custom we had bought two Fat mountain-sheep for our followers to feast upon and make merry . The morrow was to be a holiday for every one , and during the evening our little company sat grouped on the cool grass , watching the sun set , and waited for the young hunter 's moon to be born , and with it the Mohammedan New-Year . Darkness set in . There was nut a cloud in the sky , but though we watched and watched , no moon appeared . The faces about us grew long and longer as the hours passed . At last our head-man got up , looked about him , and in his low , sing-song voice remarked : " Maybe astrologer make mistake , maybe no moon come out to-night , maybe come out to-morrow night . More better we go to bed . " Whereupon the watchers one and all turned in . The next morning my sahib went bird-shooting , leaving me to my own devices . Half a mile away the village lay below us . The thatched roofs and willow-trees , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I started down the road toward the town . Ten minutes brought me to the main square , and I sat on a stone to await events . No one was about . Two or three dogs lay sleeping in one corner , a young calf was eating the remains of some corn leaves , and numerous hens were strutting among the rubbish . Several spinning-wheels with lumps of wool beside them stood in the shade of the trees . The buildings around me , nearly all of two stories , were made of a brownish mud and covered with light , tan-colored thatch . An irregular flight of steps led up the side of each but to a rude sort of door in the upper story . Under the eaves one or two windows , closed by roughly carved shutters , seemed to show the living parts of these dwellings . A clump of willow-trees shadowed a little running brook , and steep , green mountains stood out in the brilliant sunshine beyond . One part of the square was shut off by a high mud wall , but behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more pretentious by far than any of its neighbors , made of elaborately carved wood , with a peculiar sort of shingled roof instead of the usual thatch . I had no sooner noticed this building than a woman came out of its inner courtyard and , seeing me , stopped . I beckoned her to come forward . She mumbled something about " sahib . " Unfortunately , I knew no words in Kashmiri , but I shook my head and beckoned again . Then , to my astonishment , she took up a stick and began waving it wildly in the air , at the same time pointing in the direction of our camp . After some time and much gesticulating I guessed that she meant : " Would n't my sahib beat me if he found me talking with her ? " I shook my head . " Then would n't he beat her if he found us together ? " Again I shook my head most decidedly . This seemed to reassure her , and she came within a few feet of where I was sitting . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress , like all those I had seen in the distance , was a one-piece affair , falling a little below the knees , a sort of combination of a Japanesekimono and a man 's night-shirt . The women of the fields always wore a grayish-brown garment , but hers was a dark blue , made of a fine wool like a shawl , embroidered with green and turned back at the neck and sleeves with broad hands of the same shade . Splendid silver earrings:fell nearly to her shoulders ; heavy silver bracelets almost without number decorated her arms , and long necklaces of elaborate design , rings , and many sorts of silver ornaments set with Tibetan jade and turquoise hung about her person . Her hair was smooth and black and fine ; parted in the middle and drawn across her temples , it was arranged behind in dozens of little braids into which were woven strands of brown wool , the whole ending somehow in a long , untidy woolly tassel hanging as low as her knees . A small , round cap covered her shapely head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of brilliant apple-green , tied across her forehead much like a Creek fillet , while pinned to the top of her cap was a long , white-cotton scarf or veil , which floated far out behind in the wind . This scarf , I found , is used either to shield the eves from the sun or to hide the face when a terrifying sahib appears . Both scarf and smock are put in place when new , and remain in that position until they fall to pieces from decay . Only the dancing-girls and the women of their class wash in Kashmir , dirt being a badge of virtue in this topsy-turvy land . My companion charmed me at once . Her beauty , her lithe , graceful figure , and , above all , her winning smile , were irresistible . Whether she was more interested in the strange memsahib , or whether 1 was more interested in her , it would be difficult to say . My hideous pith sun-helmet first attracted her attention . I took it off , put it on , shoved in the pins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and each time her shyness disappeared as her interest grew . Meanwhile the top of the wall became lined with dark , smiling faces . Babies were being held tip to be patted and admired , and little girls and boys began scurrying about in the midst of it all my blue-gowned friend , taking me firmly by the arm , invited me into the carved house behind . The next moment I was making my way through the inner courtyard , up two flights of pitch-black mud stairs to a large room on the top floor . Behind trooped at least thirty women and young girls . ' I he sound of the patter of their bare feet coming up the steps increased the feeling of mystery that had been growing within me . The room into which my hostess led me was about twelve feet square and as clean as the proverbial whistle . There was no furniture in it except two or three carved walnut spinning-wheels . In one corner , by a large window overlooking the courtyard , was a sort of wooden dais , on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of old Kashmir workmanship . With much bowing and scraping / was asked to sit upon this improvised throne , and , following the example of my hostess , I climbed up and squatted tailor-fashion on the rug . No one spoke , but they all Jumped upon the platform , too , sitting in rows around me and in front of me , their mouths and eyes wide open with suppressed excitement . This was my opportunity , so long deequal to my knowledge of the Kashmiri language , both forms of ignorance being quite unintelligible to the women about me . Helplessly I held the soft wool until a young girl near by came to the rescue by offering to teach me the art of spinning . But though I began bravely , in less than a second the wool was tangled , the delicate thread broken in a dozen places , and the wheel jammed . Without a word , my instructor patiently unwound the tangled mass , rolled the threads skilfully between her fingers , and freed the wheel . I tried a number of times to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the last . Finally , much chagrined , I gave it up , while my companions tittered and hid their faces behind their hands as they tried to refrain from laughing . It was an awkward moment , but the tension was soon broken by the appearance of pewter plates heaped with peaches and pears , almonds and walnuts , and sprays of a delicate herb . These , together with a graceful pewter pitcher and a dozen or more pewter cups , were placed on the rug with much formality . Our hostess immediately lifted the pitcher and filled the cups with a dark-red wine , whereupon one of the young girls held close to my lips , as though to feed me , first a peach and then a pear , and finally a handful of VOL CXXIX. ? No 771 ? 103nuts , all of which I accepted as gracefully as I could . The plates were not touched . but remained on the rug , every one leaning forward and helping herself to what she wanted . Only a few of the favored ones were invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a bouquet much like that of a light claret . And while we were feasting , my hostess started to teach me the Kashmiri words for the various articles about us . We all laughed a great deal over this , and especially when she tried to pronounce the English equivalents I gave her . Fur two hours or more I stayed with the women , eating and drinking and talking in the universal sign language which seldom fails . At last I started to go . The women pulled me down . I tried again , but with the same result , until I finally realized that some excuse must be given them for my departure . The only words in Kashmiri that I knew were sizikar , meaning hunting , and chikore , meaning a partridge . With the aid of these two words , and much gesturing , smacking of lips , sighs of hunger , and so on , it was explained that my sahib was out bird-shooting , that he would come home hungry , and that I must prepare his food . This brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the rug . As I climbed off the dais , a small boy appeared , carrying a huge pewter dish laden with more fruits and nuts and vegetables , which he placed at my feet . This was a parting gift from my hostess . Meanwhile a crowd of men had gathered in the courtyard below , grumbling and shouting up at the windows . The women seemed to pay no attention to the excitement outside , so I tried to feel undisturbed . It was , as I have said , not unknown to me that the Oriental man considers his wives his sole possession , and that interference with them is always resented in some form or other ; but my white skin was , I knew , a great protection . With much bowing and scraping , my friends and I started down the stairs , my hostess holding me again firmly by the arm . The voices of the men grew louder and louder as we came nearer the door , and when we finally emerged into the courtyard the mob seemed to he seething with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way through the crowd , letting me follow close at their heels , while the rest stayed behind to argue with their irate husbands . At the gate we stopped . My hostess pressed both hands to her forehead many times , her way of bidding me good-by , and we parted . With the little boy leading the way , the laden pewter dish balanced on his head , we walked through the narrow lanes of the town , out into the fields , and up the hill to our camp . Later I learned that my hostess was the No. i wife of the magistrate of the district , the most important person for miles around . And later , too , I learned that a severe beating had been given a number of my entertainers by their respective lords and masters for associating not only with a white woman , but , worse still , with a Christian . According to Eastern etiquette the gift of my friend of the carved house should be returned , but in just what form now became a problem of momentous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very low ebb , our canned delicacies reduced to one tin of corn , which we selfishly refused to give away . Our wardrobes , too , were very restricted . Not even an extra pocket-handkerchief was included in our kits , much less anythingfrivolous or gaudy such as would appeal to the native eye . We ransacked our two small traveling-boxes over and over again , handling each article and discussing its merits as a gift . But everything we had with us was a necessity . The decision finally fell to my sahib 's one and only necktie , a red-silk one , and this was sent by a servant , with many salaams , to my hostess of the morning . That evening the new moon rose as advertised , and the New-Year celebrations began . But we were not prepared for what was to follow . Dinner was over , and we were lazily sitting in our comfortable camp-chairs warming ourselves in front of a huge bonfire . Presently the sound of singing came up from the village below , and soon it grew louder and louder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our camp-fire , appeared what proved to be the entire population of Martand . First came a crowd of men and boys , and directly behind them women , singing , as they walked , a low , monotonous sort of chant . Close to the ruins of the temple they just ust near enough for us to make out in the firelight the outlines of their long , white scarfs and louse-hanging smocks . The singers arranged themselves into rows facing one another , each woman placing her hands on the shoulders of the woman next to her . Meanwhile the men had squatted on the ground in a circle around the performers , their knees up under their chins , their shawls wrapped tightly around them in a fashion peculiar to the Kashmiri . All the while the women were singing the same chant , over and over again , sway-ing back and forth in rhythm with the music . First one row would take the air , and then the other would respond in a sort of cadence , with always the same theme repeated again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the firelight illuminating the figures , the tall columns of the old temple rising behind , and the black night enveloping everything beyond . Our Kashmiri factotum was called upon to explain what it all meant . " They come to the old temple to sing to Mohammed . They tell the story of his life . They tell of his wanderings and of his preachings , and then they tell long
