 | IT is said that William H. Vanderbilt , when asked to subscribe to the building of the elevated railroad in New York , answered , " Nobody will go upstairs to take a train . " With what marked accuracy the prophecy of that far-seeing man ? if , indeed , he really made any ? is fulfilled , is shown by the fact that more than 800,000 persons mount stairs to take trains in this city every day . And as many more go " down stairs " to take trains . Nor does the subway seem appreciably to have cut into the business of the elevated . To the casual observer , the latter appears to be doing no smaller a traffic than before the existence of its rival . During rush hours the elevated trains are run with such frequency as almost to tread on one another 's heels ? and packed at that ? an endless chain , marked at regular intervals by the colored headlights . The wonder then is how the hordes who habitual1v take the subway used to travel before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrons of the elevated road were diverted from that route , but nowhere near enough to account for the number that travel to and fro on the underground . Nor does the enormous growth of the city adequately explain the vast amount of subway patronage . To be sure , the subway penetrates the remote fastnesses of the Bronx , catching the ebb and flood of daily travel from that quarter . But the people up there used to go back and forth before this route was built . Also the facilities for surface travel have been greatly developed and extended . Be this as it may , the significant fact remains that the underground road is today preparing to extend its platforms to accommodate tencar instead of eight-car trains . At first there was much speculation as to the effect of subterranean travel on the health of the passengers . People complained of disagreeable odors , stuffiness , and the like , and even today individual patrons may be found who do not enthusiastically endorse existing conditions . But the New Yorker is adaptable . He  | had his growl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all fairness , one must admit that the company did not turn a deaf ear to complaints . Concessions were made in the matter of ventilation . Where available , sidewalks were slatted to let in the air , and rules against carrying lighted cigars , pipes or the unspeakable cigaret were effectively carried out . To facilitate the loading and unloading of trains and to protect passengers , special policemen , paid by the company and reporting to the Police Commissioner , are assigned for duty at points of greatest congestion . But tho these austere and uniformed personages rarely do more than walk about , there is no question that the moral influence of their presence is effective . Still , a policeman is like a gun , seldom needed , but when needed ? needed badly . When the building of the subway was contemplated , it was estimated that this road would carry some 400,000 passengers per day . But so kindly did the people take to this method of travel , that within a few months after its completion it was running pretty close up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it carried during the year included between January 1 and December 31 , 1905 , no fewer than 116,209,313 passengers ? roughly speaking , 318,000 per day . During the following year 149 , - 778,370 persons were transported by this route , while in 1907 182,559,990 patrons availed of its services . In 1908 , the road carried 220,991,212 passengers , a daily average of 605,455 , or 50 per cent . over and above the dreams of the prophets . On one day , during the Hudson-Fulton celebration , more than a million persons traveled one way or another by this route , but this can hardly be considered a criterion , either of capacity or facility , since conditions were abnormal . One ordinary business day ? November 26 of the present year ? 866,554 passengers traveled by the subway , while those transported under similar conditions for one day on the elevated system numbered 863,921 . However , as a rule , the subterranean route carries from 15,000 fo 20,000 passengers fewer per day than the elevated ; but it is of greatly inferior mileage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contest and allows it or more miles for five cents . Respecting so small a margin of superiority of absolute business will be appreciated when one considers that the elevated system has altogether over 118 miles of single track . The subway might be measured thus : The distance from the bridge to Ninetysixth street being covered by four tracks may be resolved into two double track roads , and so the Broadway and West Farms routes may be considered independently . The distance from the bridge to the Bronx terminal is 13.46 miles , while from the bridge along the west prong of the fork to 242d street is 14.17 miles . The distance from Atlantic avenue , Brooklyn , covered by double track , to Brooklyn Bridge , Manhattan , is 3.25 miles ? a total of 30.78 miles of double track . Some three track portions , sidings and turnouts bring the total single track mileage of the subway up to 82 miles . About 16 miles of this is built in the open on a regular elevated structure . This makes particularly interesting the opinion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Public Service Commission . Mr. Arnold says that a subway under New York conditions costs approximately three times as much to build as the present elevated road , and should handle considerably more traffic than one of the latter of corresponding length . It should , therefore ; be apparent that subways be constructed only where the traffic be of sufficient density to justify so expensive a type of road . During the first fiscal year after the beginning of operation the car mileage ( by a car mile is meant one car moving one mile ) of the subway was 31,931,073 . The following year this increased to 37 , - 184,940 , and for the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1908 , it was 44,005,213 . The earnings for the fiscal year of 1906 from transportation and other sources were $7,052,012 ; for 1907 , $8,506,923.61 ; for 1908 , $10,253,337.37 . The total operating expenses for these years were $2 , - 978,109.35 , $3,883,369.68 , $4,423,313.27 , respectively , the net earnings being $4 , - 073,902.65 , $4,623,553.93 , $5,830,024.10 for the same years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passenger seventeen  | this , Mr. Arnold claims that each passenger should pay at the rate of a cent a mile in order to make a comprehensive subway system yield a fair return on the investment . Passengers carried more than five miles and contributing less than one cent a mile each must be balanced by others traveling less than that distance and thus paying more per mile . " The only possible way to offset losses due to passengers riding from ten to fifteen miles for five cents , " says Mr. Arnold , " is to furnish a local service which will attract a greater number of passengers who will ride comparatively short distances on a five cent fare . This short haul business will not be an advantage , however , unless it can be handled in short  | haul cars , can be accommodated by cars which otherwise would run empty , or can be handled by means of moving platforms at a lower cost per passenger than by train operation . It is a matter of every day observation that there is a large amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Manhattan which is not at present accommodated by the surface or elevated systems , and it is this kind of traffic which would produce relatively the largest net returns for a subway system . " That unlooked-for business far exceeding the original estimate is coming to the subway is manifested by the action of the company in extending its facilities for handling traffic . The extended platforms will accommodate two more cars . These cars are some fifty-one feet long by eight feet seven inches wide , and seat fifty-two passengers each . It is almost impossible during any hour of the twenty-four to ride from one end of the route to the other without being in a well-filled , if not crowded , car during some period of the journey . So great is the traffic that altho the company runs some thirty-four express and as many local trains per hour during the rush time , it is no uncommon thing to see , besides two lines of strap-hangers , dangling from above and twisting and bobbing and knocking their knees against those of the sitters , and occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the car to the other . One often sees twenty-four persons crowded into the two vestibules , and eighteen riding in one vestibule , while uncommon , is not extraordinary . As a matter of fact , a thousand persons to an eight-car train during the busiest hour of the day is no uncommon thing . Surely there must be some exceptional advantage to outweigh the inconvenience of traveling thru a tube , packed like herring , and with no diverting landscape . The unfortunate thing is , Manhattan Island is so fashioned that people have to live at remote distances from their places of business . And when one considers that persons may travel from Atlantic avenue , Brooklyn , away across Manhattan Island and into the fastnesses of the Bronx ? some seventeen or eighteen miles ? in fifty minutes and for five cents , he must admit that there is little to growl at . But he does growl , for all of that ! Notwithstanding the strenuous treatment to which passengers are subjected , to the strain of standing for a long time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results from traveling in the subway . As a matter of fact , standing up may be beneficial to many persons who have to remain seated during the day , and swinging around and twisting on the strap is the only exercise many of them get . The engineers of the road are constantly studying up improvements in the handling of passengers . There is no  | limit to the capacity of the roadbed . But , obviously , trains can not be run at much shorter intervals . Therefore , the length of the train is to be increased . But with a longer train comes the danger of even greater congestion . To obviate this , side door cars have been introduced to some extent . It is believed by adopting this method of egress , the time devoted to getting a train into and out of the station may be reduced to thirty seconds . At present the traveling public does n't quite know how to avail itself of this particular kind of side door , and unfortunately there are n't enough policemen at the congested points to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons to dash for any opening they see in a subway train , and this they do . Therefore , it is probable that once these doors are applied to all cars , the public will require some little educating before their beneficent efficiency will have been fully attained . The great McAdoo system of tunnels connecting New York and New Jersey is apparently being used by numbers more than sufficient to justify its construction . That portion of the system which runs from Hoboken to Twentythird street , New York , began operating in February , 1908 ; the other portion , running from Jersey City to the HudsonTerminal , July , 1909 . About ten miles of tracks are now in use by this system . There are four single tubes under the river . On the Jersey side is a transverse tunnel extending over a mile along shore beneath the tracks of the Pennsylvania , Erie and Lackawanna railroads , with entrances to each station . In Manhattan , the company is pushing its tunnel up Sixth avenue , and will presently cut under the corner of Bryant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depot . In New Jersey , the system is extending its lines , and within a year will be running trains to and from Newark .
