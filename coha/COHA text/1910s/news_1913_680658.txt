txt One of the liveliest debates the Senate has heard in a long while was precipitated to-day when Senator Bristow 's resolution was taken up criticising Secretary Bryan 's statement that he was forced to supplement his salary by lecturing . The Republican attacks on Mr. Bryan were sometimes scathingly serious and sometimes ironically gay . But the seriousness with which the Democrats heard these attacks was shown in the fact that after tabling the resolution by almost a party vote , in an effort to head off the debate , they spent several hours defending Mr. Bryan and citing instances of lectures made by Republicans during the sessions of Congress . The Republicans seemed to gain added zest for their a-zsaults upon what they called Mr. Bryan 's official negligence by their belief that public criticism has already had some effect on the Secretary . It was reported here to-day that Mr. Bryan had canceled all lecturing engagements that would have taken him out of town when Ambassador Henry Lane Wilson arrived from Mexico . During the brisk debate in the Senate Secretary Bryan was at work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he gave the first of the Chautauqua lectures under his six weeks ' contract . He will leave here tomorrow for Winona Lake , Ind. , to give another lecture . He will return to confer with Ambassador Wilson on Mexican affairs . He said to-day that he would come back sooner if any exigency reanired . The Secretary added that the continued publication of his lecture plans was causing him annoyance because so many places where he had engagements to speak , were afraid he would cancel his contracts as he had taken care to provide he could do , if public business require it . " I am constantliy receiving telegrams . " said Mr. Bryan , " asking to be assured that engagements will be kept , and thus far nothing has occurred , to prevent keeping any of them . I shalt be very glad to give out , when I return , an announcement of further entagements , and will even go so far as o take the newspapers into my confidence and say just how much I have made by lecturing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propriety of my course . I will not say that I shall be able to satisfy the  - -  scewspapers in that respect . I shall not lecture when the public interests would suffer thereby . " Some of the most interesting developments of the debate had little to do with Mr. Bryan , and in fact followed the tabling of the Bristow resolution by a vote of 41 to 20 . Senator Borah of Idaho , a Republican , and Senator Poindexter of Washington . a Progressive , voting with the Democrats. - It seemed for a moment as if this would stop discussion . But Senator Bristow insisted on making his speech under the guise of an argument concerning another resolution . " The Democrats , " said Mr. Bristow , " can stop talk , - but they ca n't convince the country of the right of a Cabinet officer to neglect his duty and go over the country . It would be just as well for the Attorney General to abandon his office for three or four months and continue the private practice of law . The Secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 12.000 is not enough , but he leaves the work of the country to be done by subordinates who receive only 66,000 or $7,000 . " As to Mr. Bryan 's Value . " Does the Senator from Kansas , " asked Senator Vardaman of Mississippi , " really apprehend danger to the country from Mr. Bryan 's absence ? " This appeal for Mr. Bristow 's estimate of the value of Mr. Bryan 's services started a titter in the galleries , and Vice President Marshall admonished the . Sergeant at Arms to enforce silence or eject the amused spectators . " It has been said , " replied Mr. Bristow. " that the public service is better with Mr. Bryan away than with him at his desk . But I believe that if he would devote his great abilities to his duties there would be some improvement , though I can not say this positively , as I do not know his subordinates . " Senator Fall interrupted to suggest that if Mr. Bryan had paid more attention to the State Department the resolution passed on April 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico might have been answered . Mr. Bristow agreed with Mr. Fall . " Have you ever lectured for pay ? " interrupted Senator Stone . " Not while the Senate was in session or public duty required my presence here , " retorted Mr. i3ristow , angrily . I have refused lecture offers in the past few weeks that would have netted me half as much as Mr. Bryan says he hopes to make . " Senator Ashurst . an ardent Bryan man , then asked Mr. Bristow if he had always held these views of the sacredness of the public service , and , getting no direct reply , he read from a letter written by Bristow to former Senator Chester L Long , in 1006 , in which he asked for a government position , preferably on one of the Advisory Boards connected with the Panama Canal , which would pay F1%500 and require attendance in Panama only once in three months . This letter is ancient history , and figured in the campaign that Mr. Bristow finally won against Long for the United States Senate . Bristow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaning forward and shaking his fingers at Mr. Ashurst . " but I never spent $100 of public money on private telegrams , which should have gone by mail at my own expense . " " Then , " said Mr. Ashurst with an embarrassed smile , while the galleries and the floor of the Senate were swept by laughter , " the Senator does not favor keeping in touch with his constitutents ? ' Mr. Bristow retorted that he did not believe in spending the public money for private correspondence . " If the Senator means that I have spent this money on telegrams in a way that was not proper , " said Mr. Ashurst , speaking in slow , angry accents , " he says something that is wholly without foundation . I believe in keeping close to my constituents , I have sent as many as 300 telegrams in one day , and my good friend , the Senator from IC.ansas , should not lose his head over a small matter . I intend to continue to ! send these telegrams . " " My judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the Senator has ' abused his right to the telegraph frank ; that he has sent to the Secretary of the Senate bills to be paid that ought to have been paid by himself . Hie private correspondence has been conducted at public expense . " If the Senator believes I have abused this privilege , " said Mr. Ashurst , " heought to make a formal charge against me . I hereby deny to the Senate , and as a Senator , that I have used franked letters or telegrams in private business . If I have done wrong , the Senator should file charges before the Senate . " I have made my statement as broadly as possible , " said Senator Bristow , laughing , ? ! and I thought the matter was now before the Senate . When the consideration of public office is private gain , and when offices are neglected for private wealth , if the country should accept such a condition , it would mean a serious situation . " Senator Lewis , the Democratic whip , suggested that Secretary Knox left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock farm at Valley Forge . Senator Root , however , was sure that if Mr. Knox did occasionally visit his stock farm , it was not for purposes of gain . To Democratic taunts Mr. Bristow said that although he deprecated Taft 's speech-making tours , which were paid for out of the public treasury , he thought there was a vast difference between tours in which the President defended the policies of his Administration and the lecture tours made by Mr. Bryan . The tables were somewhat turned on Mr. Bristow , when Senators Stone and James insisted that Mr. Bristow , himself , absented himself from the halls of Congress to report the proceedings of the Democratic Convention at Baltimore for pay . Mr. Bristow insisted that the Senate was then working under a unanimous agreement whereby no work was to be done . But Senator James showed that during Bristow 's absence the Indian Appropriation bill , carrying more than $10,000,000 , was passed . Senator Stone gave a long list of Republican Senators who had spoken at chautecquas during sessions of the Senate as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Townsend , The debate becoming more heated , Senator James styled Mr. Bristow 's resolution , the Most " buncombe of all bunco be resolutions , " and Senator Stone said it was " political and partisan tommyrot . " Senator Townsend of Michigan made a set speech in which he criticised BryIan 's course as having an evil effect in influencing the public conception of public office . " For more than fifteen years , " said Mr. Townsend , " Mr. Bryan has posed as public censor of men and measures . He has preached duties of citizenship to establishthe standard of public service . His public acts , therefore , more than those of any other man except the President , are of influence in fixing the standards of public service and public ! Policy . " He is receiving $12,000 a year . In the Government service are thousands of employes , who receive less than onetenth of that sum . Not one of these Is permitted to abandon his post of duty , and sell his time and energies and talents to others for the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time when unusual foreign complications confront us , when the Japanese question is on , when our relations with the disturbed republic to the south of us are fraught with mighty responsibilities , when treaties affecting our relations with nations of Europe are awaiting the action of this Senate , when the question of the Panama Canal tolls is pressing hard upon us , when . the alleged . claims of Colombia are being urged , when the Congress is dealing with the tariff , containing provisions which may affect our diplomatic relations with other countries  --  indeed , at this time above all others the statement of Mr. Bryan that he is prepared to desert his office for the purpose of personal financial gain comes as a shock to all thoughtful people . " How are the virtues of economy and simplicity to be impressed upon the people , when their great advocate states that it is necessary for him to capitalize for financial gain his great ability as a Chautauqua lecturer because he can not support ' niinself and family upon $12,000 a year ? " Friends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defending his lecturing tours . assert that I often he has traveled at night to reach a place , delivered his address , and returned in time to be at his desk the following morning- . Moreover , they say , many of his absences from Washington were to keep engagements where ' ne represented the President . This was true of his trips to Harrisburg and to Pittsburgh for the Guthrie dinner , they assert , and were in the main responsible for his several visits to New York City to make speeches .
