txt The controversy between the Railroad Administration and the Industrial Board over prices to be raid for steel seems to have reached an impasse and the outlook now is either that Director-General Hines must recede from his position and accept ' the price schedule reached at the conference between the Industrial Board and the steel men or that the board must dissolve . Apparently there is no middle course , as the Industrial Board can hardly ask the steel men to reduce prices below the level which it ha : * , itself stated the public should regard as a minimum . - Nor is it at all probable that the steel men would consent to any further reduction , even were they asked to consider it . One thing appears to be clear from latest developments -- that the Railroad Administration is not opposed so much to the principle of the establishment of a price level as it is to the prices which have been established . As regards prices and costs it is argued in support of Mr. Hines ' attitude that the United States Steel Corporation 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open hearth , includes some $4 a ton of inter-company profits , making the net cost to the corporation $36 a ton , approximately . Lackawanna Steel 's costs are about $2 a ton higher , or $38 a ton . These costs would give the two companies profits of from $9 to $11 a ton en all rails if the agreed prices are sustained . Moreover , it is held that with more efficient labor due to less demand , these costs should be reduced still further , Another argument touches the question of differentials between billets and rails , it being urged that the pre-war differential was only about $2 a ton , compared with $8.50 under thr Industrial Board 's schedule . There are two cost weaknesses in this last argument , however , as in the first place rail prices were pegged before the war and the average of billets , generally , was considerably lower than of rails , but is made higher by a bias In that in one or two year , when there was a heavy steel demand , billet prices went above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differential is based on the difference between . billets and Bessemer rails whereas in discussing costs of rail production the Railroad Administration disregards Bessemer rails on the ground that all the rails being purchased are open hearth . The differential , accepting the average for billets , was $4 a ton , as against open hearth rails before the war . As regards the effect on the labor situation of the acceptance or non-acceptance of the price schedule by the Railroad Administration , the differences of opinion between the two principal patties to the controversy are fundamental , the one apparently holding that in either a ! -e the consumption of steel will be the same or more ; if the : e is any difference it will be that an open market will induce buying and employ more labor , while the other sick holds that the establishment of a minimum approved governmentally would establish confidence and cause buyers to place their orders much sooner , thus not only employing more labor but enabling the steel mills to maintain ' their present scale of wages .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
