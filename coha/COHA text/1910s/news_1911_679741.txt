txt The United States Steel corporation has decided to cancel its lease of the great Northern ore lands , and to reduce by 20 cents a ton the freight rate on iron ore on the railroads it controls in the Wm Superior district . These two steps were regarded yeeter. . day as the corporation 's response to tile findings of Commissioner of Corporations Smith in the report submitted bY him In July to President Taft . In the full text of the report , recently printed , the Commissioner says : " Indeed . in so far as the Steel Corporation 's position in the entire iron and steel industry Is of monopolistic character , . it is chiefly through its control of ore holdings and the transportation of ore , " Since the Commissioner 's report was submitted to the President it has been rumored many times that this report was being made the basis of an inquiry by the Attorney General 's office into the propriety of bringing a suit against the corporation under the Sherman Anti-Trust act . Specific reports published from Wile Ito @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought out denials from the Attorney General that any suit against the Steel Corporation had been prepared , but this has not set at rest the expectation on the part of many people in the financial district that a suit would be undertaken . Among those who have held to this view aro.some who , at the same . time , : have expressed confidence that such a suit would not be successfuL The action upon which the corporation has pow decided was regarded in wall-informed banking circles yesterday as greatly strengthening the company 's position in the event of a suit under the Sherman law , Par this reason the action now contemplated was regard , ed as an intent to remove the objections mentioned in the report of the Commissioner of Corporations . At the same time it was thought that purely business mo-J tives were not lacking for the action . Ore In Vast Quantities . The iron ore deposits covered by the lease which the Steel Corporation - has decided to terminate , have been variously , estimated by Mr. Hill and his friends as containing from 400,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while some of the eXperts of the United States Steel CorpOra ? Alen have estimated the tonnage as nearer 250,000,000 tons . The Bureau of Corporations puts it at about 300,000,000 tons . The lands containing this ore were owned Partly by the Northern Pacific Railway , but principally bY companies controlled by the Great Northern Railway . In 1906 they were placed in the hands of Trustees and leased to the United States Steel Corporation through the Great Western Mining Company , a subsidiary of the Steel Corporation , which itself guaranteed the lease . The lease provided for a minimum tonnage to be extracted each year , which increased from year to year , and also for a steadily advancing price , beginning at an initial charge of $1.65 O. ton , which included the the charge for hauling the ore over the Great Northern 's line to the upper lake ports . The lease contained a clause providing that the Steel Corporation could , if it I chose , terminate the lease in 1015 by giving two years ' notice . If not so tenni ? nated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the ore was exhausted . It is this clause that the Steel Corporation Is , now to avail itself of to sever its control over these vast deposits of ore and to leave them free , after 1915 , for purchase by any of its rivals . Just by what percentage the relinquishment of these lands reduces the Steel Corporation 's hold on the country 's iron ore deposits , chief of which are the Lake 1Superior deposits , does not appear from ' any available statistics . It depends on which of the estimates , ranging from 250 , - 000,000 tons to 1,000,000,000 tons ; is accepted . If the latter figure la closest to the truth , the ore in the Hill lands closely approximated the tonnage , of the iron - ore in the Lake Superior region controlled by the Steel Corporation up to the time it took the lease on the Hill lands . Put Millions in Developments . Under the terms of the lease the Steel Corporation 's subsidiary , in addition to the royalty paid to the Trustees of the land , had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mining the ore . It is estimated that since the lease went into effect the Steel Corporation has expended in the neighborhood of $15,000 , - 000 in development work , including ad , vance royalties , and this money can only be recovered by the use of ore from these lands in sufficient amount to offset the outlay . In its decision to out the rate on iron ore by 20 cents a ton , or from SO cents to 60 cents a ton , on the two roads controlled by it in the lake region , the Duluth &; Iron Range and the Duluth , Missabe &; Northern , the Steel Corporation is Imeethig to that extent-the second of the chief points made against it , namely , that it was charging excessive rates on are , thus putting a handicap on independent steel companies which might have to make shipments over these two railroads , This action on the part of the Steel Corporation is likely to have a still wider effect , however , for it was the opinion of railroad men well informed regarding conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily lead to a similar reduction by other lines carrring- ore to the upper lake ports . The chief of these is the Great Northern , but the Northern Pacific and the Minneapolis , St. Paul &; Sault Ste. Marie both reach an iron ore deposit a little further west which is now being developed . The Soo line already has in effect for this ere a lower - rate than that ; now charged on the other lines . The lowering of this freight rate will cause little if , indeed , any loss to the United States Steel Corporation , for what it loses nominally by reduced earnings on its railroads will be offset by a reduction in the rominal cost of Its ore . The real effect is to put in a lower rate , which independent shippers may make use of to obtain their iron ore supplies . Comment in Smith 's Report . The significance of the Steel Corporation 's proposed abandonment of its lease of the Hill ore lands and of its reduction In the freight rate on lake iron ore is emphasized by passages from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two matters . After reciting the terms of the lease of the Great Northern ore lands , the report says : The q , therefore , arises as to why the Steeluestion Corporation entered into this lease under the onerous conditions noted . The only reasonable explanation which the bureau has found for this unusual transactions is that it was designed to prevent this ore from falling into the hands of competitors of the corporation . Had this ore been sold or leased in small parcels to a large number of Independent producers this might have tended to depress the price of ore as well as to foster competition in the manufacture of iron and steel . On the other hand , if these ore lands were simply held by the Great Northern interests without development , this would leave the opportunity open for the organization of a very important rival to the Steel Corporation . At this time , however , the Steel Corporation was the only concern in the iron and steel business which was in a position to consider the acquisition of these Hill ore lands in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Steel Corporation obviously strengthened Its control of the - ore industry , and at the same time put substantial obstacles in the way of further competition in the iron and steel industry .

Had this Hill ore been acquired at a bargain price , an obvious reason for its acquisition would be furnished ; but , in view of the extraordinarily high rate of royalty at which this ore was taken over and the other onerous conditions In the lease , particularly the high minimum tonnage stipulated , the only reasonable explanation , in the opinion of the bureau , is that the corporation chiefly desired to forestall competition . The high royalty named in this lease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ore values , is rather an Indication of the extent to which the Steel corporation was ready to go in order to prevent this ore from falling Into the hands of rival Interests . Of the rates charged on iron ore the report says : Found Ore Rates Excessive . The dominating position In the ore industry enjoyed by the Steel Corporation through this great ownership of ore reserves is heightened because of its very marked degree of control of the transportation of ore in the Lake Superior district The corpom ration owns two of the most Important ore . railroads  --  the Duluth &; Iron Range Railw road and the Duluth , Missabe &; Northefir Railway .

The rate charged on these roads , the Commissioner says in his report , is undoubtedly excessive .
