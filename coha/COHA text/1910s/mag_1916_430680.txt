THE National Gallery , whether the tourist sees it first or last in his trip around Europe , is sure to make an impression . It is one of the famous galleries of the world , and has a rarefied atmosphere about it , even to those who know the galleries by heart . The walk up the wide stone steps approaching the first room excites a wonder that is almost amazement . The pictures have a richness ? a jewel quality about them ? that seems preternaturally splendid . You have not perhaps noticed such depth and mellowness of color in other galleries . What does it mean ? Well , in some cases it may mean merely that the pictures are framed under glass , and get a certain tone and richness from that ; but it more often means that you are looking at very unusual pictures . The National Gallery is full of masterpieces . Where did they come from ? Out of the famous private collections of England . When nobility dies without an heir , or the heir himself needs money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen generations come by bequest to the National Gallery , or find their way to the auction room and are purchased for the gallery . Thus it is that the National Gallery has been the natural inheritor of the rich collections of England . It started less than a hundred years ago ( in 1824 ) with the Angerstein collection , and has been growing ever since with gifts  | of collections such as those of Vernon , Wynn Ellis , Vaughan , Salting . If it is found necessary to bid for a picture at auction , a government grant or the subscriptions of wealthy art patrons , or both , generally carries the day against any private collector . Thus such famous pictures as Raphael 's " Ansidei Madonna , " Titian 's ( tish ' - an ) " Ariosto , " Holbein 's " Duchess of Milan " were bought for the gallery at enormous prices ? the Raphael bringing over $350,000 , and the others some $150,000 each . There are now about 3000 pictures in the gallery , though , of course , all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not enough wall space for that , though the building is in a chronic state of enlargement . New rooms are added from year to year , and new editions of the catalogue are being continually issued . The gallery is very well arranged and lighted , and very well managed . Management of a gallery seems very easy to the public because there is apparently no friction , the director has his trials . And the pictu have their perils , not only from acciden but from fanatical visitors . The great perils however , are from dust , gas , t tooth of time , and the hand of the ca less cleaner . The pictures in the Europe galleries have suffered more from dras scrubbing and reckless restoration th from all the other causes combined . cleaning room has been the graveyard many a masterpiece . ITALIAN MASTERPIECES Beyond doubt the Italian pictures here are the most important , both in quality and in quantity . No gallery in Europe quite equals that of London in its Renaissance masterpieces . And its Pre-Renaissance pictures are not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the altar-piece by Orcagna ( or-can ' - ya ) and the panels of Duccio ( doo ' - cho ) or Monaco ; but they are not carried so far , or so effectively , as the works of the later men ? the " Doge Loredano " by 1 ' , ellini , for example . Bellini is not the final word in art , but how perfect of its kind is this portrait of the Doge ( doje ) with its serene poise and supreme dignity ! How devoid of anything like ostentation or display ! And how direct it is in the revelation of the stern old warrior , who , when Doge of Venice , did not hesitate to wage war against France , Germany , and the Papacy ? all three together . There are a number of attractive Madonnas by Bellini in the gallery , and an " Agony in the Garden " with a famous landscape at the back ; but none of them quite comes up to the Doge in force or conviction of reality . In the same vein , but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Young Man " by Antonello da Messina and the " Young , Venetian " by Basaiti ? ( ba-saee ' - tee ) both contemporaries of Bellini in Venice . They were not his equals , however . Basaiti was his follower , as was also Catena , who is represented here by a large " Warrior Adoring the Infant Christ " ? a notable picture for Catena . Among the early Venetians in the gallery Crivelli makes a distinct impression . There are half a dozen altarpieces by him , and one hesitates to say which is the best , so very perfect in workmanship are all of them . The " Annunciation " is perhaps the type , and for pure decorative charm few pictures go beyond it . The architecture of it , the rugs , curtains , bedspread , costumes , even the peacock and the children , are all put in for color effect and to carry out the scheme of making the picture beautiful to look at , as well as interesting in story . It fairly reeks with color . Crivelli 's pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any of the early Venetian works ; and , oddly enough , they are all painted , not in oil , but in distemper ? the medium used before the introduction of oil . It was the Antonello da Messina mentioned above who is credited with bringing oil-painting to Venice about 1470 , but Crivelli declined to use it .  | GREAT VENETIANS Bellini was as famous for his pupils as for his work , he having been the master , or the influencer , of almost all the great Venetians . Giorgione ( Jor-jo ' - nee ) and Titian were his direct pupils , and the difference between the portrait of the " Doge Loredano " and the portrait of " Ariosto " by Titian is the difference between master and pupil . Both portraits are reproduced herewith in photogravure , and the student has a good opportunity to compare them . Bellini belonged to the Early and Titian to the High Renaissance , and , in a measure , the portraits emphasize a difference in time , though they may have been painted in the same year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Renaissance ? and must have painted this portrait after 15 al , when Loredano became Doge ; Titian was young , and probably painted the " Ariosto " about 1508 ; but the style of the one is early , the style of the other late . The " Doge " has great dignity , but with it rigidity of poise , sharpness of line , paucity of light and shade , thinness of color . It is emphatic rather than insinuating , and a little awkward in its positive truth . The " Ariosto , " on the contrary , is superb in its easy graceful poise , its inherent nobility of look , its perfect repose . The workmanship of it is infallibly right in its composition , its full light and shade , and its gamut of greys , browns and flesh colors . Compare the drawings of the robes for the difference between the men , and other differences will make themselves manifest . Both portraits are excellent , but they are by no means alike in point of view or method . Titian was perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ariosto " is not his only masterpiece in the National Gallery . There is an early " Madonna " and a " Christ and the Magdalen , " both of them excellent , and yet giving way in interest to his large " Ariadne and Bacchus , " the most considerable of his figure pictures north of the Alps . It is a little cold in its blue color , but perfect in workmanship , and a marvel of life and movement . Tintoretto 's " St. George and the Dragon " is a romantic-canvas that in life and spirit presses the Titian very hard . It is not possible to pick flaws in it , which can not be said about every  | Tintoretto . The charging St. George , the hurrying princess , the dead body , the sea , the sky , the distance , are quite as they should be . And what a beautiful piece of color ! Tintoretto was a genius of exalted rank , as was also Paolo Veronese , some of whose best canvases are here ? notably the large " Family of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Helena " ( reproduced herewith ) is put down to Paolo in the catalogue , and , though it may not be by him , is , nevertheless , a fine picture in decorative arrangement and color . Lotto in a superb " Family Group " and Paris Bordone ( bor-do ' - nee ) in the " Portrait of a Lady , " of a patrician type , are both extremely well represented in the gallery ; but perhaps they do not attract so much attention as a more commonplace portraitist ? Moroni . The reason of this is that the National Gallery has two of the very best works by Moroni ? the " Tailor " and the " Lawyer . " The " Tailor " is very much admired , and justly so . He is shown standing at his cutting board , shears in hand , and as the door opens he looks up to see who has entered . What a very natural action ! And what a serene , even noble , type of man ! The portrait is modern enough in method to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today who could do it . It is not , however , in the class with the Titian " Ariosto . " Compare them and you will see that intellectually the Titian is the more profound , as technically it is the more subtle . THE FLORENTINES The Florentines never had the fine color sense of the Venetians , but from that you ? - ill not infer that they never painted fine pictures . They were different from the Venetians , were more intellectual or romantic or pathetic , cared more for linear drawing than for light , shade or color . The Botticellis in the gallery illustrate this distinction . There are a number of them , and they all carry by pathetic sentiment or romance , and exhibit linear drawing primarily . The famous " Mars and Venus " shows the drawing and the " Nativity , " the sentiment . The round picture of the " Madonna , Child and St. John , " shown in the illustrations , is a school piece , but gives the Botticelli pathos in the girlish types and the sad faces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines and forms ? Filippino , contemporary of Botticelli , ( botte-chel-lee ) and much influenced by him , has here an altar-piece that is admired and copied by students as it deserves to be ; and put down to Lorenzo di Credi is a portrait of " Costanza de Medici " that is supremely fine not only in color but in character . An early Florentine , Paolo Uccello ( Oo-chel-lo ) famous for his study of perspective , is here shown in his masterpiece , " The Rout of San Romano , " and Antonio and Piero Pollajuolo ( pol-la-you-oh ' - lo ) by the " St. Sebastian , " their most important work . These are only the pictures that may justly be called great masterpieces . It is astonishing what a list may be made . The list should include the two wonderful panels by Piero della Francescathe very noblest kind of fine art , ? all the pictures by Cosimo Tura , the " Madonna " by Verrocchio , ( ver-ro ' - kee- o ) though it is merely a school piece , the " Agony in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fra Filippo , or Pisanello , or Benozzo . The Florentine trio ? Michelangelo , Raphael and Leonardo ? are represented here in rather dubious examples . The two Michelangelos are school pieces , though very good work , and the genuineness of the Leonardo da Vinci ( vin-chee ) " Madonna of the Rocks " is disputed by a similar picture in the Louvre . The London picture has much beauty about it , and no doubt Leonardo had some hand in its production , but he was probably assisted in it by a pupil . As for Raphael . there are several pictures assigned to him , but none of them gives much of an idea of that great artist . The " Ansidei Madonna cost a great deal of money , and has renown ; but it is a thin , cold work of Raphael 's youth . If you would see Raphael and judge him justly , you must go to Florence and Rome . Florence , too , is the proper place to see painters such as Andrea del Sarto , while Perugia is the spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - jo ) . One 's opinion of an Italian painter is not to be formed from seeing one or more isolated examples of him in the northern galleries .  | FLEMISH MASTERS Among the Early Flemish painters there is nothing finer than the Arnolfini portraits by Jan Van Eyck , the pathetic " Deposition " by Bouts , or the two large panels by Gerard David ( dah ' - veed ) . Work of a similar nature is shown by Gerard of Haarlem ( Geertgen tot Sint Jans ) in his " Madonna and Child . " It is delicate , miniature-like work , and not painting in any Hals or Velasquez sense ; but done with tremendous earnestness and sincerity and without a slip or flaw technically . A much later man , Gossart ( or Mabuse ) tried to elaborate the miniature method of the early men , and apply it to large canvases . The result is here shown in the large " Adoration of Kings , " wherein everything is so realized in surface appearance that you could pick up the tiles or hats or jewelled presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , considered a great feat in art , and ever since the picture was added to the gallery there have been many admirers about it . But art consists of something more than cats and fiddles to be picked up , as Sir Joshua Reynolds remarked many years ago . The Later Flemings , Rubens and Van Dyck , did not despise a surface realism , but they spent no time on petty details . They struck out with a large brush , and sought to give also the body and bulk of things . Rubens , all told , had perhaps the most learned and facile brush of any of the great painters . He was more sure than Hals , more swift than Titian , more learned than Velasquez . He was the master craftsman of them all . His " Drunken Silenus , " " Judgment of Paris " and " Chapeau de Paille " in this gallery will give you an excellent idea of his skill , his color sense , his Flemish point of view . His pupil , Van Dyck , never reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painter of the world , though he occasionally did a great portrait . One of them is in this gallery , the " Portrait of Cornelius Van der Geest , " a perfect head , done in Van Dyck 's early period ; and done so surely and truly that it will stand comparison with the best works of any period or country .  | THE DUTCHMEN In Dutch art the name of Rembrandt usually leads all the rest , and here in the London gallery are many examples put down to him . The early " Portrait of an Old Lady , " herewith reproduced , is perhaps the most satisfactory of all , not only because of its wonderful rendering of an aged face , but because of the great humanity shown in it . The tremulous line of the lips and chin , the flabby cheeks of old age , the eyes that seem filled with tears , all suggest a life that has known sorrow . That appealed to Rembrandt very strongly . He was always sympathetic with the suffering because , perhaps , he had suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a face , a hand , an arm , a bent form than he . He was the great genius of Netherland art . Hals was a mere tavern-roysterer with a gift for painting , compared with him . The National Gallery , however , has no first-rate example of Hals , though several mediocre canvases are attributed to him . Nor is Steen , or Vermeer of Delft , or De Hooch seen here at his best . By Terborch there is a " Guitar Lesson " showing a young woman in white and yellow satin that is attractive , and a beautifully drawn " Portrait of a Gentleman . " Cuyp ( kipe ) is shown , in many examples , and better than in any other European gallery . This is also true of the sea-painter Jan van de Cappelle . There is a whole wall devoted to examples by Ruisdael , ( rise ' - dale ) and among the many Hobbemas is one at least of commanding interest ? " The Avenue , Middelharnis . " It is slate-grey in color , but its linear perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GERMAN PICTURES The National Gallery is not by any means complete in its representations of the Spanish painters , though it has a number  | of excellent pictures . By Velasquez one bust portrait alone , that of Philip , is worth a day 's journey to see . There probably never was a more perfect presentation . It not only shows the physical but the moral and mental in the sitter in a most convincing way . There are several full-length portraits here ascribed to Velasquez , but they are not entirely by his hand . The " Christ Bound to the Column " is a great picture and the Rokeby " Venus " is another masterpiece ; but neither of them can be attributed with certainty to Velasquez . He was the master-painter of Spain , and Murillo , with his " Holy Family " and " St. John and the Lamb " looks very weak and sentimental beside him . Ribalta who preceded Velasquez , and Goya , who came long after him , were painters in the Velasquez tradition if they were not of his class . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Spanish with only one masterpiece of commanding importance . The large " Ambassadors " by Holbein is not that one , it being a rather commonplace affair for all its vastness ; but the " Portrait of Christina of Denmark , Duchess of Milan , " makes amends for it . Here Holbein is at his simplest and his noblest . The lady is dressed in black velvet and silk with fur edgings , and is shown against a blue background . She stands there looking at us with a faint attempt at a smile , with her beautiful hands crossed in front of her . This is one of the ladies that Henry VIII wished to marry . He had this portrait of her painted by Holbein , but did not succeed in marrying her . The portrait is a wonder of good drawing and good taste . There is nothing of value by Durer in the German collection , and the only other notable picture there is a portrait of a young girl by Lucidel.  | ENGLISH MASTERS Naturally the English pictures loom large in the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been transferred to the Tate Gallery . Here one sees Hogarth in his series " Marriage a la Mode " and in several portraits . He was the beginner in the school and one of its best painters . He , of course , had not the court and society following of Sir Joshua Reynolds who came after , with many full-length portraits of nobility painted to look a trifle nobler than reality . He was a famous master , and never did a better group than the " Lady Cockburn ( co ' - burn ) Children . " He signed his name on the edge of the dress at the bottom , and told Lady Cockburn , with a courtier 's bow , that he could not neglect the opportunity to go down to posterity on the hem of her ladyship 's garment . The saying pleased him quite as much as his painting , for he repeated it to Mrs. Siddons when painting her portrait . It is not known whether the ladies compared notes , but if they did it probably resulted in a bad quarter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Reynolds , also painted Mrs. Siddons , and made the more famous portrait of her . The color is a trifle cold in blues , and the surface is glassy ; but the portrait has dignity , personality and style . This is the picture that Gainsborough had such difficulty in painting the nose that at last he exclaimed in a rage , and it is said with some mild profanity , " Madame , there seems to be no end to your nose . " Many excellent  | portraits by both Reynolds and Gainsborough , with their contemporaries Hoppner , Romney , and others are here . The best Romney is the celebrated " Parson 's Daughter , " and the best Lawrence , the sad-faced bust portrait of Mrs. Siddons . THE TURNERS The gallery some years ago had a very extensive collection of Turners , but many of them are now removed to the Tate Gallery . The celebrated ones , such as the " Frosty Morning , " " Crossing the Brook , " and " Rain , Steam and Speed , " are still here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19,000 sketches and drawings to the National Gallery . Among the canvases were a " Dido Building Carthage " and a " Sun Rising through Vapor " that Turner in his will requested should be hung between two large pictures by Claude Lorrain ? the thought being to show how far Turner surpassed Claude . But the comparison is not wholly in Turner 's favor . He is flushed , hectic , a little spectacular , where Claude is cool , calm and serene . The Turners are more cunning in artifice , but they lack Claude 's simplicity and sincerity . Claude and Poussin ( poo ' - sang ) , by whom there are plenty of canvases here , were past masters in their time and it is somewhat dangerous for any modern to put himself in comparison with them . Art is not , after all , a thing that will bear comparisons so well as contrasts . It is supposed to reveal the individuality of the man behind the brush , and one great pleasure of the great galleries is that they show us these differing individualities ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
