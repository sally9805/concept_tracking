txt The French Government is negotiating with T. P. Morgan &; Co. and associated bankers for placing in this country a comprehensive new loan , out of the proceeds of which payment will be made for both Government and commercial purchases . Gossip in the financial district has it that discussions are turning on a credit of about $=00.000,000 , but no amount has been agreed upon nor has the form which the loan will take been decided . Octave Romberg , the financial representative of the French Government in this country , said yesterday that it was true , as he said some weeks ago , that no negotiations had then been entered into , and that there had accordingly been no delays in the matter . He said the French Government 's finances , as regards obligations due in the i:nited States . had always been in a comfortable position , and that there was no haste necessary now In agreeing upon terms . From the French Government 's share of the *480,000,000 raised by means of the Anglo-French loan there remains unexpended between $30,000,000 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various other means for providing cash in the United States as it is needed . Most important among these is the sale of American securities owned in France , which has been going on steadily for a long time . He also said that his Government hadl at no time been concerned in the movements of exchange on Paris and had used no artificial means to keep the price of francs up . The recent weakness was due entirely , he thought , to the break in the rate of French exchange on London , which directly effects a similar reduction at this centre . London has been calling gold from France . Mr. Homberg 's statement follows : " The last call on the Anglo-French Loan seems to have created in the financial district of New York an impression that the French Government was about to find itself short of dollars for its payment here , unless a new credit was Immediately arranged . Therefore a certain feeling of nervousness has manifested itself on the Exchange market , . and perhaps also a certain amount of speculation has been undertaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly ' to a very high quotation . As was pointed out several weeks ago , the French Government has several distinctmeans of securing credits in dollars . As long as the French Government has at its disposal its share of the proceeds of the Anglo-French Loan , it naturally would have less recourse to these other means ; when its share is exhausted , however , and the  --  fact that the last call has been " made for the 20th instant , does not prove that this ! is already the case , the French Government - will then make use more freely of these other means . " At any rate , one can be assured that the French Government will not find it any more necessary at the present time , than it has since last Fall , to go out into the Exchange market and purchase dollars . ' No orders are placed by the . Government in the United States until all ? arrangments ; have been made for the financing of the same without purchasing exchange . ? " At this time , negotiations for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although nothing is pressing , one can be sure . that the French Government , true to its foresight and careful policy , will make such arrangements that funds which might be required will always be at is disposal long before they are actifally. needed .
