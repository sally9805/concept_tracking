 | THE traveler in old Russia finds no more interesting place than the Kremlin at Moscow , that collection of the memorials of East 's contacts with West through many centuries . In the Kremlin he will find no more pathetic relics than those which testify to the victory of Russia in the long rivalry that decided whether the great power of eastand northern Europe should be Russia Poland . Russia won , and in sign thereof may be seen . in a wonderful carved casket in the kremlin museum , the Constitution of the Polish Kingdom , adopted May 3 , 1791 . The American traveler will bethink himself that there is a striking proximity of date to that of the adoption of our Federal charter . If he pursues the subject , he will discover that the Polish Constitution of 1791 was , as nearly as it might well be made , an adaption to Poland 's conditions of the Constitution of the United States of America , submitted by the convention at Philadelphia on September 17 , 1787 . To-day that Polish Constitution is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort of an expiring nationality to deserve perpetuation . It recalls that the fires of the American Revolution of 1775 and the French Revolution of 1789 found reflection in the skies of eastern Europe . But it was too late for Poland . Torn by factional dissensions , victim of the intrigues of more stable neighbors , menaced by the rising Russia at the east , the covetous Austria in the west , the ambitious Germany in the north , and the rapacious Turks in the south , Poland fell in the moment of the finest inspiration that had marked all its pitiful career as a nation . The first child of democratic genius among Slavic peoples was stricken down as the penalty for too early disclosing his talents to a sordid world . For the memorials of Poland in its power and glory we may go to ancient Cracow , where the ashes of a long line of kings lie in the great cathedral which is both the Westminster Abbey and the Valhalla of the lost nation ; but for the present-day testimonies that the spirit and purpose of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village of Rapperswil , where for safety 's sake the patriots of the disinherited race have set up their national museum . But Poland 's is not all a story of martyrdom . It is also a story of the tragedy of retribution . It may well be doubted whether Poland ever possessed in any single generation the attributes of a true nation . It was ruled by a land-owning aristocracy which tried to keep the king from getting too much power , and at the same time insisted that the people should not get any . The Polish aristocracy succeeded where other medieval aristocracies failed , and its success was Poland 's ruin . The king was kept a figurehead , isolated from the mass of people largely by reason of the Polish custom of electing kings . It all looked very democratic ; but in fact it merely served to keep aliens or weaklings on the throne much of the time . Thus suppressing the king and oppressing the people , the aristocracy became a military  | and political caste , lived in barbaric splendor , despised trade and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , affected the use of alien languages , and devised institutions of government which ultimately deprived it of capacity for exercising the very governmental functions it had monopolized . The Polish people are Slays , and Poland is literally the plain-land , the great central European depression . There was hardly a time when a surveying party could have laid down accurate limits of the country , nor a generation throughout which those limits would have remained stationary . Nature provided no obvious frontiers , but in general old Poland included the valley of the Vistula River ? Galicia , which belongs now to AustriaHungary ; the westernmost projection of Russia , commonly called Russian Poland ; and East Prussia . All this represented perhaps a third of the present area of France . Beyond , extending northeast , cast , and southeast , lay the Polish hinterland , comprising Courland and Livonia on the Baltic Sea ; farther south , the great extent of Lithuania ; south of this , Volhynia , Podolia , and the Ukraine , extending to the Black Sea . We commonly think of Poland as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its widest extent it touched both the Baltic and the Black ; and Polish ambition clung fiercely to the thought of a national heritage looking out on these twain windows of the cold and warm seas , with western Europe before it , and the illimitable East at its back . If Polish national policy had been as vigorous and effective as Polish ambitions were magnificent , the state might have led in subduing the east of Europe , and Poland to-day have been the mighty empire of the steppes , its heart at Cracow instead of Moscow , its head at Warsaw instead of St. Petersburg . At the time when the cavaliers were settling in Virginia , Poland was the great state of eastern Europe . Touching both the Baltic and the Black seas , it reached in the west to well within a hundred miles of Berlin , and in the east about as near to Moscow . The extreme north-andsouth length of the country was about seven hundred miles ; that east and west approximately the same . It embraced little less than 300,000 square miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only Russia had so wide an extent ; and Russia then signified about as much to the Western world as Nigeria does to us . Warsaw , the capital , was almost the geographic center of Europe . The geographic Poland of that da . now restored to its place among nations . would have more population than France . and this number would include , besides the Poles , fully half the Jews in the world , together with millions of Mongols , Turks , Finns , Scandinavians , Teutons , Latins ? the greatest conglomerate of races and tongues in any nation , if perhaps Austria-Hungary be excepted . Indeed , Austria-Hungary gives us an idea of what Poland was in its greatness . We think of the dual empire of to-day as a mid-European jumble of fragments o races , languages , and religions , crowded together in an empire that yet is not a nation ; held together by pressure from without , not cohesion within . Poland also was a dual kingdom , composed of Poland proper and Lithuania . In Poland , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of felicity . Whether Austria and Hungary can be held together after the life of the present ruler has been for decades a favorite speculation with European politicians . That same speculation as to Poland and Lithuania was in the forefront of eastern-European politics for centuries . As Warsaw in the time of Poland 's greatness was the pivot on which turned the contest between East and West , so is Vienna to-day . The East at last captured Warsaw . Now it is pressing on to Vienna . The glacial Slavic race is the western outpost of east , forever pushing toward the west . That unknown and unknowable East is both age and youth ? age , with its power to bide in calm assur- ance ; youth in its impetuous demand that it be served . Who can contemplate Poland 's fate of yesterday and not forecast the future of Austria-Hungary ? Who , visioning the sweep of these huge forces through the centuries behind , and projecting it just a little way into the tomorrows , can feel assurance that the world is fighting its last great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a Slavic people along the Vistula in the second century of our era . History safely identifies them only six or seven centuries later as an agricultural people , with those institutions of communism in the soil , patriarchal authority in the family , and democracy in the small community that were characteristic of all the Slays . There is a legend of a good peasant King Piast , putative progenitor of Poland 's rulers for many generations . Under King Mieczyslaw , in the latter half of the tenth century , the country was converted to Christianity , and claimed as tributary to that German Empire which yet survived in some of the greatness Charlemagne had won for it . But Germany relinquished the claim , and Boleslaus , the next king in Poland , was saluted as equal by a German Otto , who in sign of their kingly equality gave Boleslaus the lance of a good old saint . As proof of Poland 's rightful status among the kingdoms , they will still show this lance to visitors in the cathedral at Cracow . Boleslaw conquered most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly with Russia , and a later King Boleslaus fell into a quarrel with Pope Gregory VII , who placed the kingdom under an interdict , so that several successive kings in Poland were refused recognition as such by Rome . For generations an almost constant warfare was carried on by the Poles against the German emperors , who repeatedly tried to reassert their suzerainty ; against the eastern Slays in what is now Russia ; against Bohemia and Hungary . The Mongols , then the terror of all eastern Europe , made various irruptions even as far west as Poland . During this period , down to the accession of Casimir the Great in the first part of the fourteenth century , the political and social evils which were at last to ruin Poland began to develop clearly . The peasants were extremely miserable , because the nobility were warring among themselves when there was no convenient foreign enemy to oppose . The nobles held the land , but were too busy with their feuds to develop it . No noble might engage in trade or industry . The peasants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were mere chattels attached to the land , and those of better estate who were entitled to live where they pleased , even to hold a little land . But the tendency , as always in such a state , was toward bearing down the free peasant to the level of the enslaved . During this period the Teutonic Knights come into Poland 's story . In the Teutonic Knights , originating in far-away Palestine , we see the beginning of that militarist power that is the Prussia of today . During the crusades the Hospital of Saint Mary was established at Jerusalem . When the infidels at last captured the city , the memory of this institution was perpetuated by the creation of the Order of the Teutonic Knights of Saint Mary 's . Two other orders were created for the defense of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem , the Knights Templars and the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem . Perhaps the Teutonic Knights have played the largest part , for they founded the power of the Prussian state . While the other two orders continued in the fatuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knights transferred their seat to the lower Vistula , promising to Christianize the pagan Prussians , which , with fire and sword and the barbaric zeal of medieval Christianity , they certainly did . When they ran out of a supply of convenient pagans to proselyte , they turned attention to Poland , which was generally in a state of sufficient turbulence to warrant intervention . The quarrels between the Polish state and the Knights went far to break both . Each in  | its time was the most important power in northern and eastern Europe . The great Casimir came to the Polish throne in 1333 , and introduced Poland into the European family of nations . He fought Russians , Tatars , and Lithuanians successfully ; gave his approval to the organization of a rudimentary parliament ; and , because he had no son , permitted the convocation of the nobles to choose his successor , thus allowing the precedent to be established which made the throne elective , and ultimately brought Poland to ruin . For the nobles imposed conditions on the crown , and these conditions they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief cause of Poland 's failure . We may vision the greatness that might have grown yet greater in the Poland of this time . From the East and the Mediterranean countries came a commerce so rich that Dantzic and Cracow won their way into the Hanseatic League ; furs came from Russia ; fabrics and spices , perfumes and jewels , from the East . Warsaw was founded seemingly with the destiny of being one of the entrepots of the world , a half-way house between East and West . The nephew whose election to the throne Casimir had procured was Louis of Hungary . With his demise , his daughter Jadwiga , a good and beautiful woman , was elected queen . She wedded Jagello , Duke of Lithuania , and thus Lithuanian and Polish crowns were united , and Lithuania was Christianized . The Jagellon family ruled in Poland ? always , however , through elections ? the greater part of three centuries . The first Jagello reigned nearly half a century . His crowning military exploit was the utter defeat of the Teutonic Knights in a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the battle of Tannenberg was fought between Germans and Russians a few months ago . For centuries Poland was the buffer for western Europe against Tatars , Turks , and Russians ; but instead of appreciating Poland 's services , Sweden , Germany , Austria , Prussia , and Bohemia were commonly quarreling with her . Poland of to-day , dismembered and prostrate while East and West fight over her . is merely living again the agonies that have been her part for a thousand years . It is impossible here even to outline this continuation of struggles . Early in the sixteenth century the liberum veto gained recognition in the Polish diet . This and the pacta conventa were twin causes of the country 's ruin . The liberum veto was the power , claimed and finally granted , of a single member to veto all business by refusing to make it unanimous . The pacta conventa took almost all power from the king ; the elective system compelled long interregnums between rulers while domestic faction and foreign influence were intriguing to dictate the succession ; the liberum veto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus weakened within and beset from without , Poland could only be sacrificed . Yet there were periods when the country came near rising to its opportunities . Under Sigismund Augustus , latter sixteenth century , the nation saw one of these eras ; but when he died , Austria , France , Sweden , and Russia presented candidates for the crown , a rich prize . Henry of Valois , brother of the French king , was elected after a long and ruinous interregnum . He was brought to Poland in great state , hailed as the sign of a glorious union with France , crowned at Cracow , and in less than a year later ran away from the kingdom on learning that his brother had died and he was successor to the throne of France . He left a banquethall at midnight , sneaked to the outskirts of his capital , and rode madly the rest of the night to get beyond the country 's border . The diet declared the throne vacant , and Stephen Bathori , a Transylvanian prince , was elected king . Bathori was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the turbulent , selfish , unseeing nobility , who considered the country their oyster . When he died the country was widely extended and seemingly powerful , but institutionally  | rotten . After a period of riots , murders , and turbulence it elected a Swedish prince , another Sigismund . The election was accomplished only after a battle had been fought to drive the insistent Austrian candidate out of the country . Such were the woes Poland periodically experienced in picking for itself a king who commonly knew neither it nor its people , and to whom it gave no power . During this reign occurred the strange affair of the false Demetrius , a bogus claimant to the Russian throne . The actual heir had been disposed of , probably by murder . The pretender was backed by a junta at Cracow , and apparently also by Rome . At any rate , he had ample funds , and a Polish army went to Moscow , placed him on the throne , and maintained him there for a short time , till he was murdered in an outbreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperial adventure will illumine one of the strange pages of history . It is believed that a document in the Vatican archives , if accessible , would prove who he was and what backing he had . If it was a PolishCatholic plot to bring Russia under the Latin church , it failed ; but it brought Poland nearer than it ever was again to domination of Russia . The seventeenth century saw the country overrun by a Swedish invasion , Cracow and Warsaw being taken . The king , John Casimir , was driven into Silesia , and after the Swedes had made peace and retired , he warned his subjects that unless they ceased their internal strifes the country would surely be taken from them by their neighbors . Indeed , the idea of a partition of Poland was undoubtedly seriously considered at this time , more than a century before it actually took place . The closing years of the seventeenth century saw the last burst of the old Polish glory . The Turks prepared their great raid on western Europe , and in 1683 appeared before Vienna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Louis XIV of France was willing that Austria should suffer . So Poland , headed by the splendid John Sobieski , who had been elected king because of earlier victories over the Turks , sent an army to save Vienna . The Turkish horde , supposed to be irresistible , was overthrown just outside Vienna with terrific slaughter , and Sobieski made Poland the savior of Europe , as Charles Martel , on the field of Tours , had made France its savior near a thousand years before . But proud as they were of the glory he had garnered for them , the Polish grandees would not let even Sobieski rehabilitate their country . He lived a dozen years after the Vienna campaign , often on the verge of abdicating in disgust . A weak king succeeded him , who fell into a quarrel with Charles XII of Sweden . Charles conquered the country , deposed the king , set up a new one , and marched on to conquer Russia , just as Napoleon did a century later . Like Napoleon , Charles took Moscow ; and taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Turkey , as Napoleon went to Elba ; he came back as did Napoleon , and tried again . He rehabilitated his fortunes so far that he was able to launch new projects of empire which looked to the conquest of Norway first , then to the invasion of ' England . He was killed while besieging Frederikshald , in Norway , almost exactly a century before Napoleon lost Waterloo . It is a strange parallel between two men who sought to rule Europe at intervals of a century ; the more suggestive , in view of the present-day effort of another ambitious prince , after another century , to achieve what both failed to do . When Poland escaped from the Swedish conqueror , the Russians . restored a weak king , Stanislaus Leszcynski ; next , the Germans came uppermost , and placed the Elector of Saxony on the throne of Poland . He reigned till his death in 1763 . Then came the last act in the tragedy ? the dictation by Russia and Prussia , jointly , of the election of Stanislaus Augustus Poniatowski as king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poland , and it is worth while to tell a little of his election . He was a Pole of noble  | family , born in 1732 , and raised in the elegant and cosmopolitan fashion of the wealthy Poles . He went as a secretary to the English ambassador at St. Petersburg . where he met the Grand Duchess Catharine , already beginning to shine in that process of plot and intrigue that brought her to the throne as Catharine the Great . Among the amours of this marvelous woman none was fraught with more significance in history than that with young Poniatowski . There seems no doubt that the woman did the courting . In her memoir Catharine frankly tells of her affection for this man and her long liaison with him , which she coolly says might have lasted indefinitely had he not become bored ! Not so the lady ; though the affaire had ended long before , she as empress kept a warm place for him in her regard . Opportunity presenting , she not only supported him , but induced Frederick the Great to join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , it is plain enough that Frederick and Catharine intended to take Poland from the day they set this weakling on the throne . Maria Theresa of Austria came in for a part of the spoil , and suffered the only conscientious scruples that seem to have assailed any of the triumvirate of imperial freebooters . In May , 1764 , the Convocation Diet , a sort of nominating convention , met in Warsaw . The city was full of Russian and Prussian troops , with no few Tatars carrying bows and arrows . Poland still pretended independence , but it had only the shadow of a national existence . Stanislaus Augustus was forced upon the country , and later the convention of electors , gathered in the famous field at Warsaw , ratified the choice . There were 80,000 qualified electors , but only a few thousand appeared . The soldiers of Catharine and Frederick were probably more numerous than the Polish electors , and their show of power insured the result . Under this coercion , the Polish convention elected the last king of their country . Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bar was formed at the town of that name to throw off the Russian domination . It improvised an army , attempted to force reforms , and was overthrown by Catharine 's troops . Count Casimir Pulaski , a soldier of fortune and of freedom who afterward fought in the American Revolution and to whom Congress has recently erected a statue in Washington , was a son of the man who headed the Confederation of Bar . Count Pulaski organized a strange plot to kidnap the king , right in the heart of Warsaw , at night . A handful of conspirators actually seized the king and got him well out of the city . Ignorance . treachery , and superstition foiled the plan . which seems to have been aimed not the murder or even dethronement of Stanislaus , but at getting him securely into the power and influence of the patriots . The plot failed , as did the whole effort of awakening patriotism and understanding among the Poles . In 1772 , Russia , Austria , and Prussia began the division of territory , taking perhaps two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Dnieper ; Austria getting Galicia and some adjacent lands to the southeast , and Prussia receiving a liberal slice in what is now eastern Prussia . After this rape of their domain , the Poles tried to reform their country and save it . The liberum veto was abolished , but the upper classes had no serious notion of giving real freedom to the peasants . Religious and race prejudices were more bitter than in the progressive countries of the Continent . There were some earnest and thoughtful people who watched the American Revolution , and these guided the deliberations of Poland 's Long Parliament , the famous diet that met in 1788 and continued four years . This diet convened just a year after the Constitution for the United States had been framed . It was marked throughout by a sincere effort to save the country by adapting to it the scheme of the muchadmired American union . The crown was made hereditary , and a very fair scheme of constitutional monarchy was  | adopted . But the nobles , facing loss of their political authority , fled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ induced Russia to send armies into Poland , exactly as the exiled French nobility a little later enlisted the toryism of monarchial Europe against the Revolution in France . Suppressing corrupt and wretched Poland was easier than suppressing inspired and frenzied France . Again foreign troops entered the country , and another partition took place in 1792 , and a third in 1795 , which finished the business by wiping Poland off the map . In 1814 the lines were somewhat reorganized by the Congress of Vienna ; but this was merely writing the epitaph . Of course there were afterclaps . The revolutionary movement centering in France kept the fires of Polish ambition burning . When Napoleon rose to power , the Poles looked for him to restore their country . He established the Duchy of Warsaw , which seemed the promise of a later Kingdom of Poland ; and when he marched away to Moscow , a great force of Poles joined him , fatuously imagining that the conqueror had been raised up to restore their ancient country . When the Corsican was at last subdued , Russia took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an autonomous kingdom , with the czar as king . But the promise was shadowy , and its realization still less substantial . In 1830 there was a revolt which , being suppressed , ended the fiction of this PolishRussian kingdom . Another uprising in 1863 , marked by assassination , terrorism , and all the horrors of guerilla warfare , brought further devastation to the Russian parts of the country . After this Russia set about deliberately to suppress the Polish language , break down the national spirit , and Russify the country . Under a policy instigated by Bismarck , Prussia has Prussianized the German parts of Poland with methods about as objectionable , though perhaps less effective . Austria has come nearer discouraging Polish national feeling than either Germany or Russia , partly because Galicia , the Austrian part of old Poland , was never fully Polish ; partly because the Poles have been given a generous part in governing their own provinces and in the affairs of the dual empire . A Pole has even been premier of the empire . The present is a time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of the present war pledged herself to restore Poland . More recently Germany and Austria have given a like promise . After the war the council of Europe will decide whether Poland shall be restored or whether the old partition shall be confirmed . Restored , it would likely be no more capable of united action than formerly , for the various parts have been knitted more or less firmly by ties of education , industrialism , travel routes , and economic relationship into their several places in the present-day scheme of European affairs . The peasant masses are yet poor and uneducated ; much of the land has passed away from the old noble families ; the Poles , even in their restored country , would number a doubtful majority ; and the non-Polish elements would have little enthusiasm about returning to the ancient regime . At best it would be little more than another buffer state , like the little powers of the Balkan States . To-day Poland is once more the battleground between Germans and Slays ; its fate , more awful than in any war of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its experience in all the other centuries since the irrepressible conflict of Slav and Teuton began . In the light of history 's experience and to-day 's realizations of Europe 's complex problems , its future is anything but promising . Much pretty sentiment and more foolish sentimentality have been written about the " fate of the lost republic . " But no man who regards to-day 's conditions in Mexico as a menace to our own country can be far from understanding the pretext that served Catharine and Frederick for taking Poland . Nature did not mark out  | its territory in big , bold strokes as the domain of a nation . Napoleon saw in rivers , mountain ranges , and oceans the natural boundaries of states ; Poland had none of these . She was right in the middle of the European world , pressed on all sides , without natural defenses . Turks , Tatars , Slays , Northmen , Austrians , Germans ? all were her natural enemies , and to all she was accessible ; for all she was at one time or another a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have extended their influence and become a great power ; but the Poles were without that genius . They were basically democratic , as all Slays are , but they were woefully without constructive faculty . Calling their country a republic , the ruling class , composed of the landowning nobles or the decadent members of the caste who had lost their land , while still possessing the proud tradition of having once held it , was willing to fight among themselves for freedom , but always to unite in preventing the masses from getting it . This caste became numerous , and as its economic power diminished , its jealousy of its political authority increased . A noble might wear a sword , and vote for king in the convocation of electors , though he owned not a foot of land . He might sell his vote for king , or he might run a peasant through with his sword on penalty of a modest fine . He was much given to both practices . It has been observed that the authorities attribute the institutional weakness of the Polish state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pacta conventa , or contract between nobles and king , deprived the king of almost all real power , save when , in war , he headed the army . The nobles took no chances of turning up a king who might make common cause with the peasants , as had often happened in western Europe , and clip the wings of the privileged class . In other states the curtailment of the regal power was always accompanied by an increase of the parliamentary authority . In Poland the power taken from the king was given to nobody . Instead , the nobles actually sur- rendered their own powers by yielding tr the liberum veto in the diet . The pacta conventa at its full development must strike a twentieth-century reader as rather a charter of liberties than an apple of discord . The king was elective ; only the parliament could make war . impose taxes , or commission ambassadors : parliament must be convened at least biennially ; the king 's cabinet was to be elected by the diet once a year . The sovereign might not even wed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the powers so liberally shorn from the king would seem well reposed in the parliament ; but Poland 's parliament never rose to a realization of its own dignity . It would be in session only a very short time ; commonly , the shorter the better , because it could seldom agree on anything save the privilege of florid oratory . This incompetent diet was reduced at length to absolute impotence by the liberum veto . The liberum veto was the privilege of a single member of the diet to nullify and piece of legislation , or a whole session 's legislative work , by simply rising in his place and solemnly proclaiming , " I forbid ! " When first asserted it was bitterly opposed , but the principle was at length accepted . If it seems utterly inexplicable that a legislature would thus surrender all its power , a medieval Pole might with reason retort that in the American Senate unlimited debate is even now permitted ; that , according to high parliamentary authority , the great bulk of legislation is done virtually by unanimous consent ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member , by a point of order , may strike from a supply bill any proposed limitation on the use of the funds . Despite the pacta conventa and the liberum veto , Poland might have built up a constitutional system suited to a limited monarchy if it had had responsible cabinet government . But the cabinet , while chosen by the diet , was not responsible . If the privy treasurer had stolen the revenues , an investigation by the diet could be ended instanter by the liberum veto ,  | and there were always corrupt personages to exercise it . But it was not for want of " Rules of Order " printed entirely in the aspirated consonants that Poland fell . The Poles called their country a republic , and their institutions might have justified their claim if only they had understood that a republican government must be truly representative . It must represent all the people ; Poland 's represented a select upper class only . It was the world 's most undemocratic attempt at a republic . The frailties of its institutions were a reflection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government to the people . Throughout the period of its importance as a nation Poland elected its king . Like almost all peoples habited to the monarchic idea , the Poles imagined that a king must be of the kingly caste , born to the purple . Whether he was competent to rule , whether a Pole or not , whether he understood or sympathized with the people , was not so important . Because of a dread of building up too great a power in the reigning family , there appeared repeatedly a positive prejudice against allowing the , succession to remain in the direct line . So Poland was found constantly shopping about the courts of Europe for an amiable prince willing to wear its crown on terms which involved the sacrifice of his self-respect . The king was the merest figurehead ; the nobility ruled . And never was there a class in any state more devoted to liberty ? strictly for its own use ? than this Polish aristocracy . Never a caste more determined to have no real power above or no real freedom below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agriculture ; never in industry , trade , finance . The peasants were too poor and ignorant to dream of themselves as real partners in the nation . Their backs burned and bled under the burden of the turbulent nobility and its sport of everlastingly quarreling with itself . Some of the kings , indeed , in despair of ever getting on with the nobles , bethought themselves of that stratagem of the old British monarchs , who enlisted the peasants on their side , and united king and people against the barons ; but in Poland the nobility always managed to frustrate such efforts . So treasonable a project on the king 's part was sure sign that if he were not driven to abandon it , he would at least be succeeded by a king weak and acquiescent enough to undo whatever he had accomplished . When a king died and a successor was to be chosen , there was a great scramble among the princely families of neighboring states for the advantage of providing a sprig of royalty to wear the crown . Austria , France , Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bohemia were constantly intriguing for the Polish scepter . Austria was peculiarly successful in marrying its princesses to Polish kings . This continual plotting for the throne inevitably inspired the idea of partitioning Poland . In the long interregnums between the demise of a king and the election of a successor , other nations , espousing the cause of this or that aspirant , often sent armed forces to support the factions with which they were intriguing . The country was thus kept in a demoralization that made the constant foreign wars almost a relief because for the time they compelled a certain . cohesion and cooperation . We may stratify the Polish people roughly into four social layers : at the top , the impotent king and his gorgeous , profligate court ; next , the small group of rich and really powerful nobles who owned the land , maintained as many armed retainers as they could , and ruled in their several castellans and palatinates ; next , the minor nobility , or sczlachta , who owned little or no land , but were none the less proud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this the peasantry free and the bond , but the freeman tending constantly toward the level of the lower class . These classes constituted the Polish people . They did not include any industrial or merchant classes ; these were in-  | troduced from the outside , and were mainly Germans and Hebrews . These were never considered a part of the Polish community ; they were in it , not of it . The Germans were long ruled in a curious extraterritorial fashion under the lex Magdeburgicum . Aliens in race , denied political participation , socially despised , these outlanders became largely the burghers of the towns , the merchants . Finally , there were the religious divisions among the people : Jews and Gentiles , Tatars and Teutons , Turks and Slays , Protestants and Catholics and Greek orthodox . Lithuania was largely disposed toward the Greek Church . Roman Catholic and Lutheran reform forces struggled for domination , the Catholic power asserting itself . The kings were latterly sworn to enforce religious toleration , but the oath meant chiefly that the nobles were denying the king power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest ardor . The differences of language were accentuated as a national weakness by the fact that the ruling class of Poles were never very loyal to their native tongue . They cultivated Latin as the language of literature and government long after it had been generally abandoned in more Western countries , and they dropped from it into French and Italian as the tongues of culture and elegance . Thus while other north-of-Europe peoples were perfecting their native languages , the Poles were dissipating that most potent of all national ties , a common and beloved tongue . Here one of the greatest opportunities of Slavonic leadership was lost . The various strata and parts of the Polish people never became acquainted with one another . The superior classes did not take any interest in the peasantry , but regarded themselves as the nation , and the peasantry as if they might have been an inferior order of beings . Nobility and peasantry alike looked upon the Germans and the Jews , who were willing to submit to the degradation of trade and industry , as mere outlanders . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poland was lost from the main-traveled highways of the world . There had been a time when a great corn merce between far East and West passed in considerable part through Poland , but the Tatar irruptions closed the northern caravan routes , and the fall of Constants nople clogged the more southerly . This had a large part in cutting off the commercial classes of Poland from intimacy with the progressive communities to the west . The exclusive classes in Poland did , indeed , continue relations with the West , but they were the relations of a sycophantic social class rather than of the virile , enterprising body of the nation . The discovery of America and of the ocean routes to the east left Poland off the revised map of the world , and the country , too late , was thrown hack on its own scant resources of capacity for modernistic development . If Poland in the era of chivalry could have been blessed with more isolation . more chance to develop a phase of that fine , individualizing provincialism that England produced , and if later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there might have been a different and a happier story of the nation .
