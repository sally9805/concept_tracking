txt Victor Carlstrom , the Swedish aviator , completed yesterday a flight of 600 miles , from Toronto to this city , in six hours and forty minutes , which is one of the fastest distance flights known . The distance from Toronto to New York in a direct line is 517 miles . But was estimated that Mr. Carlstrom covered *83 miles in addition owing to the fact that he was blown out of his course by the high wind . . Leaving Toronto at 0:48 o'clock Wednesday morning , he landed at Binghamton at 1:31 o'clock in the afternoon . Starting yesterday from Binghamton at 2:10 O'clock in the afternoon . he flew over New York City and landed on the Palisades , near Fort Lee , N. J. , at 5:07 o'clock . His landing was perhaps the most remarkable part of the flight . He was in darkness , and was forced to pick out , by its indistinct outlines , a vacant field in which to descend . The machine came down at the rate of forty miles an hour , without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dent mariner , " reiited , , the iittry'itifAils flight to a reporter .1*Eo.t. night at , tho. , Aare WM720 Madiaon k-V ? iitie ; ' 1:t tekideeto - mike the whole distance in ' one ' flight , " he said , " and- I Would have done It if I had not become dizzy not long before I reached Binghamton . There was a strong , gusty wind blowing , and the machine rocked a great deal , and in addition to that I had been having some trouble with my Stomach , so I had to come down . I was then about 5,000 feet up , and it is not a very healthy thing to get dizzy When you are up that far , " he observed . smiling dryly : " The people of Binghamton seemed surprised when I dropped out of the sky , " he wept on , " but . they afforded me every help I needed and took care of the machine overnight .

" When I swung toward Binghamton from Toronto , I guided myself by the compass and kept my eye on the chart . until I picked up the tracks of the Lackawanna Railroad , which I followed thereafter , and so did not have to watch my cord pass . " In the same way I followed the Erie Railroad soon after I left Binghamton today and came down the Hudson . The wind was very strong , and I tried flying at about 7,000 feet for a short time , but it was much worse there , and I had to come down to 5,000 . As I neared New York it was almost dark and quite hazy . I could only see one bank of the Hudson , and I was n't any too sure of that . However , I swung over the city and went west on Forty-second Street , across the Forty-second Street ferry .

Of course I could not know that the field was pretty soft , and when I landed I made the dirt fly . I guess the machine will have to be dug out . " The machine which Mr. Carlstrom flew is an R-2 military tractor Curtiss biplane , of the type now ! being sunPlied to the Allies . Instead of carrying an observer , as is done in war practice . he carried 146 gallons of gasoline . . of ' which a quantity was unused in the flight . In addition to the aviator , who weighed about 160 pounds , the aeroplane carried about 960 pounds dead weight when the flight was begun . The machine was built to carry 1,400 pounds in all , and to make a speed of ninety miles an hour with such a load . The purpose of the flight was to test the new 160 horse power steel motor , the V-X type , which Glenn H. Curtiss has just perfected . In this motor the new American steel is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIMES On Tuesday . This steel , or similar steel , was formerly supplied by the Krupp Works at Essen , and after the war began American motor manufacturers were severely handicapped by lack of it , but experts in American steel mills eventually succeeded in turning out as good , if net a better , product . According to Mr. Carlstrom , the motor did not " miss " during the entire flight , and he was never in danger of " engine trouble " at any time . Alan R. Hawley , President of the Aero Club . said last night that the flight was a splendid Performance . " It was the best this year . " Mr. Hawley said , " and was exceptional in that Mr. Carlstrom was forced to buck a strong wind the greater part of the way . I have recommended him for the Aviation Medal of America , which is soon to be awarded for 1915 by the Governors of the Aero Club . The medal is given for the best cross-country flight each yea ' .
