If Mr. Bryan preaches such doctrines , then your readers who condemn bins for to doing should reflect that helping to keep the peace of the world is not work unworthy of a Secretary of State . If Austria had teachers of this sort . and a Chautauqua of her own . we might he spared this war . The advanced nations fight with reluctance , the most feudal and backward start the blaze . It is a token of ignorance . Let Mr. Bryan spread all the enlightening ideas he may possess .
