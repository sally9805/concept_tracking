Our scene is in a rusty lodging-house of the Lower Town , Boulogne-sur-Mer , and the time , the early twilight of dark November in northern France . This particular November is dark indeed , for it is November of the year 1793 , Frimaire of the Terror . The garret room disclosed to us , like the evening lowering outside its one window , and like the times , is mysterious , obscure , smoked with perplexing shadows ; these flying and staggering to echo the shiftings of a young man writing at a desk by the light of a candle . We are just under the eaves here ; the dim ceiling slants ; and there are two doors : that in the rear wall is closed ; the other , upon our right , and evidently leading to an inner chamber , we find ajar . The furniture of this mean apartment is chipped , faded , insecure , yet still possessed of a haggard elegance ; shamed odds and ends , cheaply acquired by the proprietor of the lodging-house , no doubt at an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The single window , square and mustily curtained , is so small that it can not be imagined to admit much light on the brightest of days ; however , it might afford a lodger a limited view of the houses opposite and the street below . In fact , as our eyes grow accustomed to the obscurity we discover it serving this very purpose at the present moment , for a tall woman stands close by in the shadow , peering between the curtains with the distrustfulness of a picket thrown far out into an enemy 's country . Her coarse blouse and skirt , new and as ill-fitting as sacks , her shop-woman 's bonnet and cheap veil , and her rough shoes are navely denied by her sensitive , pale hands and the highbred and in-bred face , long profoundly marked by loss and fear , and now very white , very watchful . She is not more than forty , but her hair , glimpsed beneath the clumsy bonnet , shows much grayer than need be at that age . This is ANNE DE LASEYNE . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her brother , fair and of a singular physical delicacy , is a finely completed product of his race ; one would pronounce him gentle in each sense of the word . His costume rivals his sister 's in the innocence of its attempt at disguise : he wears a carefully soilded carter 's frock , rough new gaiters , and a pair of dangerously aristocratic shoes , which are not too dusty to conceal the fact that they are of excellent make and lately sported buckles . A tousled cap of rabbit-skin , exhibiting a tricolor cockade , crowns these anomalies , though not at present his thin , blond curls , for it has been tossed upon a dressing-table which stands against the wall to the left . He is younger than MADAME DE LASEYNE , probably by more than ten years ; and , though his features so strikingly resemble hers , they are free from the permanent impress of pain which she bears like a mourning-badge upon her own . He is expending a feverish attention upon his task , but with patently unsatisfactory results ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his pen , shakes his head forebodingly , and again and again crumples a written sheet and throws it upon the floor . Whenever this happens ANNE DE LASEYNE casts a white glance at him over her shoulder  --  his desk is in the center of the room  --  her anxiety is visibly increased , and the temptation to speak less and less easily controlled , until at last she gives way to it . Her voice is low and hurried . ANNE Louis , it is growing dark very fast . p. 3 LOUIS I had not observed it , my sister . He lights a second candle from the first ; then , pen in mouth , scratches at his writing with a little knife . ANNE People are still crowding in front of the wine-shop across the street . LOUIS smiling with one side of his mouth.Naturally . Reading the list of the proscribed that came at noon . Also waiting , amiable vultures , for the next bulletin from Paris . It will give the names of those guillotined day before yesterday . For a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room  --  yes , hers , too  --  are all three in the former . As for the latter  --  well , they ca n't get us in that now . ANNE eagerly . Then you are certain that we are safe ? LOUIS I am certain only that they can not murder us day before yesterday . As he bends his head to his writing a woman comes in languidly through the open door , bearing an armful of garments , among which one catches the gleam of fine silk , glimpses of lace and rich furs  --  a disordered burden which she dumps pell-mell into a large portmanteau lying open upon a chair near the desk . This new-comer is of a startling gold-and-ivory beauty ; a beauty quite literally striking , for at the very first glance the whole force of it hits the beholder like a snowball in the eye ; a beauty so obvious , so completed , so rounded , that it is painful ; a beauty to rivet the unenvious stare of women , but from the full blast of which either king or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luster of it is not breathed upon even by its over-spreading of sullen revolt , as its possessor carelessly arranges the garments in the portmanteau . She wears a dress all gray , of a coarse texture , but exquisitely fitted to her ; nothing could possibly be plainer , or of a more revealing simplicity . She might be twenty-two ; at least it is certain that she is not thirty . At her coming , LOUIS looks up with a sigh of poignant wistfulness , evidently a habit ; for as he leans back to watch her he sighs again . She does not so much as glance at him , but speaks absently to MADAME DE LASEYNE . Her voice is superb , as it should be ; deep and musical , with a faint , silvery huskiness. p. 4 ELOISE the new-comer . Is he still there ? ANNE I lost sight of him in the crowd . I think he has gone . If only he does not come back ! LOUIS with grim conviction . He will . ANNE I am trying to hope not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you overestimate his importance . Have n't I said it often enough ? ANNE under her breath . You have ! ELOISE coldly . He will not harm you . ANNE looking out of the window . More people down there ; they are running to the wine-shop . LOUIS Gentle idlers ! The sound of triumphant shouting comes up from the street below . That means that the list of the guillotined has arrived from Paris . ANNE shivering . They are posting it in the wine-shop window . The shouting increases suddenly to a roar of hilarity , in which the shrilling of women mingles . LOUIS Ah ! One remarks that the list is a long one . The good people are well satisfied with it . To ELOISEMy cousin , in this amiable populace which you champion , do you never scent something of  --  well , something of the graveyard scavenger ? She offers the response of an unmoved glance in his direction , and slowly goes out by the door at which she entered . LOUIS sighs again and returns to his scribbling. p. 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOUIS indicating the floor strewn with crumpled slips of paper . A dozen . ANNE Not good enough ? LOUIS with a rueful smile . I have lived to discover that among all the disadvantages of being a Peer of France the most dangerous is that one is so poor a forger . Truly , however , our parents are not to be blamed for neglecting to have me instructed in this art ; evidently they perceived I had no talent for it . Lifting a sheet from the desk . Oh , vile ! I am not even an amateur . He leans back , tapping the paper thoughtfully with his pen . Do you suppose the Fates took all the trouble to make the Revolution simply to teach me that I have no skill in forgery ? Listen . He reads what he has written . " Committee of Public Safety . In the name of the Republic . To all Officers , Civil and Military : Permit the Citizen Balsage , "  --  that 's myself , remember  --  " and the Citizeness Virginie Balsage , his sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Citizeness Marie Balsage , his second sister "  --  that is Eloise , you understand  --  " to embark in the vessel Jeune Pierrette from the port of Boulogne for Barcelona . Signed : Billaud Varennes . Carnot . Robespierre . " Execrable ! He tears up the paper , scattering the fragments on the floor . I am not even sure it is the proper form . Ah , that Dossonville ! p. 6 ANNE But Dossonville helped us  --  LOUIS At a price . Dossonville ! An individual of marked attainment , not only in penmanship , but in the art of plausibility . Before I paid him he swore that the passports he forged for us would take us not only out of Paris , but out of the country . ANNE Are you sure we must have a separate permit to embark ? LOUIS The captain of the Jeune Pierrette sent one of his sailors to tell me . There is a new Commissioner from the National Committee , he said , and a special order was issued this morning . They have an officer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that the order is obeyed . ANNE But we bought passports in Paris . Why ca n't we here ? LOUIS Send out a street-crier for an accomplished forger ? My poor Anne ! We can only hope that the lieutenant on the quay may be drunk when he examines my dreadful " permit . " Pray a great thirst upon him , my sister ! He looks at a watch which he draws from beneath his frock . Four o'clock . At five the tide in the river is poised at its highest ; then it must run out , and the Jeune Pierrette with it . We have an hour . I return to my crime . He takes a fresh sheet of paper and begins to write. p. 7 ANNE urgently . Hurry , Louis ! LOUIS Watch for Master Spy . ANNE I can not see him . There is silence for a time , broken only by the nervous scratching of LOUIS 'S pen . LOUIS at work . Still you do n't see him ? ANNE No . The people are dispersing . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they knew  --  He breaks off , examines his latest effort attentively , and finds it unsatisfactory , as is evinced by the noiseless whistle of disgust to which his lips form themselves . He discards the sheet and begins another , speaking rather absently as he does so . I suppose I have the distinction to be one of the most hated men in our country , now that all the decent people have left it  --  so many by a road something of the shortest ! Yes , these merry gentlemen below there would be still merrier if they knew they had within their reach a forfeited " Emigrant . " I wonder how long it would take them to climb the breakneck flights to our door . Lord , there 'd be a race for it ! Prize-money , too , I fancy , for the first with his bludgeon . ANNE lamentably . Louis , Louis ! Why did n't you lie safe in England ? p. 8 LOUIS smiling . Anne , Anne ! I had to come back for a good sister of mine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it  --  " alone " ! He lowers his voice as he glances toward the open door . For she would not have moved at all if I had n't come to bully her into it . A fanatic , a fanatic ! ANNE brusquely . She is a fool . Therefore be patient with her . LOUIS warningly . Hush . ELOISE in a loud , careless tone from the other room . Oh , I heard you ! What does it matter ? She returns , carrying a handsome skirt and bodice of brocade and a woman 's long mantle of light-green cloth , hooded and lined with fur . She drops them into the portmanteau and closes it . There ! I 've finished your packing for you . LOUIS rising . My cousin , I regret that we could not provide servants for this flight . Bowing formally . I regret that we have been compelled to ask you to do a share of what is necessary . ELOISE turning to go out again . That all ? p. 9 LOUIS lifting the portmanteau . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually do . What now ? LOUIS flushing painfully . The portmanteau is too heavy . He returns to the desk , sits , and busies himself with his writing , keeping his grieved face from her view . ELOISE You mean you 're too weak to carry it ? LOUIS Suppose at the last moment it becomes necessary to hasten exceedingly  --  ELOISE You mean , suppose you had to run , you 'd throw away the portmanteau . Contemptuously . Oh , I do n't doubt you 'd do it ! LOUIS forcing himself to look up at her cheerfully . I dislike to leave my baggage upon the field , but in case of a rout it might be a temptation  --  if it were an impediment . ANNE peremptorily . Do n't waste time . Lighten the portmanteau . LOUIS You may take out everything of mine . ELOISE There 's nothing of yours in it except your cloak . You do n't suppose  --  p. 10 ANNE Take out that heavy brocade of mine . ELOISE Thank you for not wishing to take out my furlined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take out both the cloak and the dress . ELOISE astounded . What ! LOUIS You shall have mine . It is as warm , but not so heavy . ELOISE angrily . Oh , I am sick of your eternal packing and unpacking ! I am sick of if ! ANNE Watch at the window , then . She goes swiftly to the portmanteau , opens it , tosses out the green mantle and the brocaded skirt and bodice , and tests the weight of the portmanteau . I think it will be light enough now , Louis . LOUIS Do not leave those things in sight . If our landlord should come in  --  ANNE I 'll hide them in the bed in the next room . Eloise ! She points imperiously to the window . ELOISE goes to it slowly and for a moment makes a scornful pretense of being on watch there ; but as soon as MADAME DE LASEYNE has left the room she turns , leaning against the wall and regarding LOUIS with languid amusement . He continues to struggle with his ill-omened " permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her gaze , glances consciously over his shoulder and meets her half-veiled eyes . Coloring , he looks away , stares dreamily at nothing , sighs , and finally writes again , absently , like a man under a spell , which , indeed , he is . The pen drops from his hand with a faint click upon the floor . He makes the movement of a person suddenly awakened , and , holding his last writing near one of the candles , examines it critically . Then he breaks into low , bitter laughter. p. 11 ELOISE unwillingly curious . You find something amusing ? LOUIS Myself . One of my mistakes , that is all . ELOISE indifferently . Your mirth must be indefatigable if you can still laugh at those . LOUIS I agree . I am a history of error . ELOISE You should have made it a vocation ; it is your one genius . And yet  --  truly because I am a fool I think , as Anne says  --  I let you hector me into a sillier mistake than any of yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , when I consented to this absurd journey , this tiresome journey  --  with you ! An " escape " ? From nothing . In " disguise . " Which does n't disguise . LOUIS his voice taut with the effort for self-command . My sister asked me to be patient with you , Eloise  --  ELOISE Because I am a fool , yes . Thanks . Shrewishly . And then , my worthy young man ? He rises abruptly , smarting almost beyond endurance . LOUIS breathing deeply . Have I not been patient with you ? p. 12 ELOISE with a flash of energy . If I have asked you to be anything whatever  --  with me !  --  pray recall the petition to my memory . LOUIS beginning to let himself go . Patient ! Have I ever been anything but patient with you ? Was I not patient with you five years ago when you first harangued us on your " Rights of Man " and your monstrous republicanism ? Where you got hold of it all I do n't know  --  ELOISE kindling . Ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Books ! Brains ! Men ! LOUIS " Books ! Brains ! Men ! " Treason , poison , and mobs ! Oh , I could laugh at you then : they were only beginning to kill us , and I was patient . Was I not patient with you when these Republicans of yours drove us from our homes , from our country , stole all we had , assassinated us in dozens , in hundreds , murdered our King ? He walks the floor , gesticulating nervously . When I saw relative after relative of my own  --  aye , and of yours , too  --  dragged to the abattoir  --  even poor , harmless , kind Andr de Laseyne , whom they took simply because he was my brother-in-law  --  was I not patient ? And when I came back to Paris for you and Anne , and had to lie hid in a stable , every hour in greater danger because you would not be persuaded to join us , was I not patient ? And when you finally did consent , but protested every step of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Pouting ! " LOUIS And when that stranger came posting after us so obvious a spy  --  ELOISE scornfully . Pooh ! He is nothing . LOUIS Is there a league between here and Paris over which he has not dogged us ? By diligence , on horseback , on foot , turning up at every posting-house , every roadside inn , the while you laughed at me because I read death in his face ! These two days we have been here , is there an hour when you could look from that window except to see him grinning up from the wine-shop door down there ? ELOISE impatiently , but with a somewhat conscious expression . I tell you not to fear him . There is nothing in it . LOUIS looking at her keenly . Be sure I understand why you do not think him a spy ! You believe he has followed us because you  --  ELOISE I expected that ! Oh , I knew it would come ! Furiously . I never saw the man before in my life ! LOUIS pacing the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ; a hired trailer of your precious " Nation's. " p. 14 ELOISE haughtily . The Nation is the People . You malign because you fear . The People is sacred ! LOUIS with increasing bitterness . Are n't you tired yet of the Palais Royal platitudes ? I have been patient with your Mericourtisms for so long . Yes , always I was patient . Always there was time ; there was danger , but there was a little time . He faces her , his voice becoming louder , his gestures more vehement . But now the Jeune Pierrette sails this hour , and if we are not out of here and on her deck when she leaves the quay , my head rolls in Samson 's basket within the week , with Anne 's and your own to follow ! Now , I tell you , there is no more time , and now  --  ELOISE suavely . Yes ? Well ? " Now ? " He checks himself ; his lifted hand falls to his side . LOUIS in a gentle voice . I am still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low and formal obeisance , and drops dejectedly into the chair at the desk . ELOISE dangerously . Is the oration co&amp;nacute ; cluded ? LOUIS Quite . p. 15 ELOISE suddenly volcanic . Then " now " you 'll perhaps be " patient " enough to explain why I should n't leave you instantly . Understand fully that I have come thus far with you and Anne solely to protect you in case you were suspected . " Now , " my little man , you are safe : you have only to go on board your vessel . Why should I go with you ? Why do you insist on dragging me out of the country ? LOUIS wearily . Only to save your life ; that is all . ELOISE My life ! Tut ! My life is safe with the People  --  my People ! She draws herself up magnificently . The Nation would protect me ! I gave the people my whole fortune when they were starving . After that , who in France dare lay a finger upon the Citizeness Eloise d'Anville ! LOUIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps if you had not given them your property they would have taken it , anyway . Dryly . They did mine . ELOISE agitated . I do not expect you to comprehend what I felt  --  what I feel ! She lifts her arms longingly . Oh , for a Man !  --  a Man who could understand me ! LOUIS sadly . That excludes me ! p. 16 ELOISE Shall I spell it ? LOUIS You are right . So far from understanding you , I understand nothing . The age is too modern for me . I do not understand why this rabble is permitted to rule France ; I do not even understand why it is permitted to live . ELOISE with superiority . Because you belong to the class that thought itself made of porcelain and the rest of the world clay . It is simple : the mud-ball breaks the vase . LOUIS You belong to the same class , even to the same family . ELOISE You are wrong . One circumstance proves me no aristocrat . LOUIS What circumstance ? ELOISE That I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it only by supposing some hushed-up ancestral scandal . Brusquely . Do you understand that ? LOUIS I overlook it . He writes again . ELOISE Quibbling was always a habit of yours . Snapping at him irritably . Oh , stop that writing ! You ca n't do it , and you do n't need it . You blame the people because they turn on you now , after you 've whipped and beaten and ground them underfoot for centuries and centuries and  --  p. 17 LOUIS Quite a career for a man of twenty-nine ! ELOISE I have said that quibbling was  --  LOUIS despondently . Perhaps it is . To return to my other deficiencies , I do not understand why this spy who followed us from Paris has not arrested me long before now . I do not understand why you hate me . I do not understand the world in general . And in particular I do not understand the art of forgery . He throws down his pen . ELOISE You talk of " patience " ! How often have I explained that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me throw off my incognito . If anyone questions you , it will be sufficient if I give my name . All France knows the Citizeness Eloise d'Anville . Do you suppose the officer on the quay would dare oppose  --  LOUIS with a gesture of resignation . I know you think it . ELOISE angrily . You tempt me not to prove it . But for Anne 's sake  --  LOUIS Not for mine . that , at least , I understand . He rises . My dear cousin , I am going to be very serious  --  ELOISE O heaven ! She flings away from him. p. 18 LOUIS plaintively . I shall not make another oration  --  ELOISE Make anything you choose . Drumming the floor with her foot . What does it matter ? LOUIS I have a presentiment  --  I ask you to listen  --  ELOISE in her irritation almost screaming . How can I help but listen ? And Anne , too ! With a short laugh . You know as well as I do that when that door is open everything you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the open doorway , where MADAME DE LASEYNE instantly makes her appearance , and after exchanging one fiery glance with ELOISE as swiftly withdraws , closing the door behind her with outraged emphasis . ELOISE breaking into a laugh . Forward , soldiers ! LOUIS reprovingly . Eloise ! ELOISE Well , open the door , then , if you want her to hear you make love to me ! Coolly . That 's what you 're going to do , is n't it ? LOUIS with imperfect self-control . I wish to ask you for the last time  --  p. 19 ELOISE flouting . There are so many last times ! LOUIS To ask you if you are sure that you know your own heart . You cared for me once , and  --  ELOISE as if this were news indeed . I did ? Who under heaven ever told you that ? LOUIS flushing . You allowed yourself to be betrothed to me , I believe . ELOISE " Allowed " is the word , precisely . I seem to recall changing all that the very day I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polite . Pray correct me if my memory errs . How long ago was it ? Six years ? Seven ? LOUIS with emotion . Eloise , Eloise , you did love me then ! We were happy , both of us , so very happy  --  ELOISE sourly . " Both ! " My faith ! But I must have been a brave little actress . LOUIS I do not believe it . You loved me . I  --  He hesitates . ELOISE Do get on with what you have to say . LOUIS in a low voice . I have many forebodings , Eloise , but the strongest  --  and for me the saddest  --  is that this is the last chance you will ever have to tell  --  to tell me  --  He falters again. p. 20 ELOISE irritated beyond measure , shouting . To tell you what ? LOUIS swallowing . That your love for me still lingers . ELOISE promptly . Well , it does n't . So that 's over ! LOUIS Not quite yet . I  --  ELOISE dropping into a chair . O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope that you and Anne may be permitted to escape ; but as for me , since the first moment I felt the eyes of that spy from Paris upon me I have had the premonition that I would be taken back  --  to the guillotine , Eloise . I am sure that he will arrest me when I attempt to leave this place to-night . With sorrowful earnestness . And it is with the certainty in my should that this is our last hour together that I ask you if you can not tell me that the old love has come back . Is there nothing in your heart for me ? ELOISE Was there anything in your heart for the beggar who stood at your door in the old days ? LOUIS Is there nothing for him who stands at yours now , begging for a word ? p. 21 ELOISE frowning . I remember you had the name of a disciplinarian in your regiment . She rises to face him . Did you ever find anything in your heart for the soldiers you ordered tied up and flogged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who starved in your fields ? LOUIS quietly . No ; it was too full of you . ELOISE Words ! Pretty , little words ! LOUIS Thoughts . Pretty , because they are of you . All , always of you  --  always , my dear . I never really think of anything but you . The picture of you is always before the eyes of my soul ; the very name of you is forever in my heart . With a rueful smile . And it is on the tips of my fingers , sometimes when it should n't be . See . He steps to the desk and shows her a scribbled sheet . This is what I laughed at a while ago . I tried to write , with you near me , and unconsciously I let your name creep into my very forgery ! I wrote it as I wrote it in the sand when we were children ; as I have traced it a thousand times on coated mirrors  --  on frosted windows . He reads the writing aloud . " Permit the Citizen Balsage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his second sister , the Citizeness Marie Balsage , and Eloise d'Anville "  --  so I wrote !  --  " to embark upon the vessel Jeune Pierrette  --  " You see ? He lets the paper fall upon the desk . Even in his danger , that I feel closer and closer with every passing second , your name came in of itself . I am like that English Mary : if they will open my heart when I am dead , they shall find , not " Calais , " but " Eloise " ! p. 22 ELOISE going to the dressing-table . Louis , that does n't interest me . She adds a delicate touch or two to her hair , studying it thoughtfully in the dressing-table mirror . LOUIS somberly . I told you long ago  --  ELOISE smiling at her reflection . So you did  --  often ! LOUIS breathing quickly . I have nothing new to offer . I understand . I bore you . ELOISE Louis , to be frank : I do n't care what they find in your heart when they open it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never reflected that there might be something for me to forgive you ? ELOISE glancing at him over her shoulder in frowning surprise . What ! LOUIS I wonder sometimes if you have ever found a flaw in your own character . ELOISE astounded . So ! Turning sharply upon him . You are assuming the right to criticize me , are you ? Oho ! LOUIS agitated . I state merely  --  I have said  --  I think I forgive you a great deal  --  p. 23 ELOISE beginning to char . You do ! You bestow your gracious pardon upon me , do you ? Bursting into flame . Keep your forgiveness to yourself ! When I want it I 'll kneel at your feet and beg it of you ! You can kiss me then , for then you will know that " the old love has come back " ! LOUIS miserably . When you kneel  --  ELOISE Can you picture it  --  Marquis ? She hurls his title at him , and draws herself up in icy splendor . I am a woman of the Republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ELOISE Its daughter has no need of yours ! LOUIS Until you kneel to me . You have spoken . It is ended . Turning from her with a pathetic gesture of farewell and resignation , his attention is suddenly arrested by something invisible . He stands for a moment transfixed . When he speaks , it is in an altered tone , light and at the same time ominous . My cousin , suffer the final petition of a bore . Forgive my seriousness ; forgive my stupidity , for I believe that what one hears now means that a number of things are indeed ended . Myself among them . ELOISE not comprehending . " What one hears ? " p. 24 LOUIS slowly . In the distance . Both stand motionless to listen , and the room is silent . Gradually a muffled , multitudinous sound , at first very faint , becomes audible . ELOISE What is it ? LOUIS with pale composure . Only a song ! The distant sound becomes distinguishable as a singing from many unmusical throats and pitched in every key , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly louder . The door of the inner room opens , and MADAME DE LASEYNE enters . ANNE briskly , as she comes in . I have hidden the cloak and the dress beneath the mattress . Have you  --  LOUIS lifting his hand . Listen ! She halts , startled . The singing , the drums , and the tumult swell suddenly much louder , as if the noise-makers had turned a corner . ANNE crying out . The " Marseillaise " ! LOUIS The " Vultures ' Chorus " ! ELOISE in a ringing voice . The Hymn of Liberty ! p. 25 ANNE trembling violently . It grows louder . LOUIS Nearer ! ELOISE running to the window . They are coming this way ! ANNE rushing ahead of her . They have turned the corner of the street . Keep back , Louis ! ELOISE leaning out of the window , enthusiastically . Vive la  --  She finishes with an indignant gurole as ANNE DE LASEYNE , without comment , claps a prompt hand over her mouth and pushes her vigorously from the window . ANNE A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildly . They are following a troop of soldiers . LOUIS The National Guard . ANNE Keep back from the window ! A man in a tricolor scarf marching in front . LOUIS A political , then  --  an official of their government . ANNE O Virgin , have mercy ! She turns a stricken face upon her brother . It is that  --  LOUIS biting his nails . Of course . Our spy . He takes a hesitating step toward the desk ; but swings about , goes to the door at the rear , shoots the bolt back and forth , apparently unable to decide upon a course of action ; finally leaves the door bolted and examines the hinges . ANNE , meanwhile , has hurried to the desk , and , seizing a candle there , begins to light others in a candelabrum on the dressing-table . The noise outside grows to an uproar ; the " Marseillaise " changes to " a ira " ; and a shaft of the glare from the torches below shoots through the window and becomes a staggering red patch on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those candles in the sconce , Eloise ! Light all the candles we have . ELOISE , resentful , does not move . LOUIS No , no ! Put them out ! ANNE Oh , fatal ! She stops him as he rushes to obey his own command . If our window is lighted he will believe we have no thought of leaving , and pass by . She hastily lights the candles in a sconce upon the wall as she speaks ; the shabby place is now brightly illuminated . LOUIS He will not pass by . The external tumult culminates in riotous yelling , as , with a final roll , the drums cease to beat . MADAME DE LASEYNE runs again to the window . ELOISE sullenly . You are disturbing yourselves without reason . They will not stop here . ANNE in a sickly whisper . They have stopped . LOUIS At the door of this house ? MADAME DE LASEYNE , leaning against the wall , is unable to reply , save by a gesture . The noise from the street dwindles to a confused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blouse , strides to the door , and listens. p. 27 ANNE faintly . He is in the house . The soldiers followed him . LOUIS They are on the lower stairs . He turns to the two women humbly . My sister and my cousin , my poor plans have only made everything worse for you . I can not ask you to forgive me . We are caught . ANNE vitalized with the energy of desperation . Not till the very last shred of hope is gone . She springs to the desk and begins to tear the discarded sheets into minute fragments . Is that door fastened ? LOUIS They 'll break it down , of course . ANNE Where is our passport from Paris ? LOUIS Here . He gives it to her . ANNE Quick ! Which of these " permits " is the best ? LOUIS They 're all hopeless  --  He fumbles among the sheets on the desk . ANNE Any of them . We ca n't stop to select . She thrusts the passport dnd a haphazard sheet from the desk into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes and a clinking of metal become audible as the soldiers ascend the upper flight of stairs p. 28 ELOISE All this is childish . Haughtily . I shall merely announce  --  ANNE uttering a half-choked scream of rage . You 'll announce nothing ! Out of here , both of you ! LOUIS No , no ! ANNE with breathless rapidity , as the noise on the stairs grows louder . Let them break the door in if they will ; only let them find me alone . She seizes her brother 's arm imploringly as he pauses , uncertain . Give me the chance to make them think I am here alone . LOUIS I ca n't  --  ANNE urging him to the inner door . Is there any other possible hope for us ? Is there any other possible way to gain even a little time ? Louis , I want your word of honor not to leave that room unless I summon you . I must have it ! Overborne by her intensity , LOUIS nods despairingly , allowing her to force him toward the other room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very close , comes to a sudden stop . There is a sharp word of command , and a dozen muskets ring on the floor just beyond the outer door . ELOISE folding her arms . You need n't think I shall consent to hide myself . I shall tell them  --  p. 29 ANNE in a surcharged whisper . You will not ruin us ! With furious determination , as a loud knock falls upon the door . In there , I tell you ! Almost physically she sweeps both ELOISE and LOUIS out of the room , closes the door upon them , and leans against it , panting . The knocking is repeated . She braces herself to speak . ANNE with a catch in her throat . Who is  --  there ? A SONOROUS VOICE French Republic ! ANNE faltering . It is  --  it is difficult to hear . What do you  --  THE VOICE Open the door . ANNE more firmly . That is impossible . THE VOICE Open the door . ANNE What is your name ? THE VOICE Valsin , National Agent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ANNE I am here alone . I am dressing . I can admit no one . THE VOICE For the last time : open ! p. 30 ANNE No ! THE VOICE Break it down . A thunder of blows from the butts of muskets falls upon the door . ANNE rushing toward it in a passion of protest . No , no , no ! You shall not come in ! I tell you I have not finished dressing . If you are men of honor  --  Ah ! She recoils , gasping , as a panel breaks in , the stock of a musket following it ; and then , weakened at rusty bolt and crazy hinge , the whole door gives way and falls crashing into the room . The narrow passage thus revealed is crowded with shabbily uniformed soldiers of the National Guard , under an officer armed with a saber . As the door falls a man wearing a tricolor scarf strides by them , and , standing beneath the dismantled lintel , his hands behind him , sweeps the room with a smiling eye.This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ruffle is of lace , his stockings are of silk ; the lapels of his waistcoat , overlapping those of his long coat , exhibit a rich embroidery of white and crimson . These and other details of elegance , such as his wearing power upon his dark hair , indicate either insane daring or an importance quite overwhelming . A certain easy power in his unusually brilliant eyes favors the probability that , like Robespierre , he can wear what he pleases . Undeniably he has distinction . Equally undeniable is something in his air that is dapper and impish and lurking . His first glance over the room apparently affording him acute satisfaction , he steps lightly across the prostrate door , MADAME DE LASEYNE retreating before him but keeping herself between him and the inner door . He comes to an unexpected halt in a dancing-master 's posture , removing his huge hat  --  which displays a tricolor plume of ostrich feathers  --  with a wide flourish , an intentional burlesque of the old-court manner . p. 31 VALSIN Permit me . He bows elaborately . Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At your service : Valsin , Agent of the National Committee of Public Safety . He faces about sharply . Soldiers ! They stand at attention . To the street door . I will conduct the examination alone . My assistant will wait on this floor , at the top of the stair . Send the people away down below there , officer . Look to the courtyard . Clear the streets . The officer salutes , gives a word of command , and the soldiers shoulder their muskets , march off , and are heard clanking down the stairs.VALSIN tosses his hat upon the desk , and turns smilingly to the trembling but determined MADAME DE LASEYNE . ANNE summoning her indignation . How dare you break down my door ! How dare you force your  --  VALSIN suavely . My compliments on the celerity with which the citizeness has completed her toilet . Marvelous . An example to her sex . ANNE You intend robbery , I suppose . VALSIN with a curt laugh . Not precisely . ANNE What , then ? p. 32 VALSIN I have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Marquis de Valny-Cherault , formerly of the former regiment of Valny ; also formerly  --  ANNE cutting him off sharply . I do not know what you mean by all these names  --  and " formerlies " ! VALSIN No ? Persuasively . Citizeness , pray assert that I did not encounter you last week on your journey from Paris  --  ANNE hastily . It is true I have been to Paris on business : you may have seen me  --  I do not know . Is it a crime to return from Paris ? VALSIN in a tone of mock encouragement . It will amuse me to hear you declare that I did not see you traveling in company with Louis Valny-Cherault . Come ! Say it . ANNE stepping back defensively , closer to the inner door . I am alone , I tell you ! I do not know what you mean . If you saw me speaking with people in the diligence , or at some posting-house , they were only traveling acquaintances . I did not know them . I am a widow  --  VALSIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 33 VALSIN And lonely , of course ? apologetically . Loneliness is in the formula : I suggest it for fear you might forget . ANNE doggedly . I am alone . VALSIN Quite right . ANNE confusedly . I am a widow , I tell you  --  a widow , living here quietly with  --  VALSIN taking her up quickly . Ah  --  " with " ! Living here alone , and also " with "  --  whom ? Not your late husband ? ANNE desperately . With my niece . VALSIN affecting great surprise . Ah ! A niece ! And the niece , I take it , is in your other room yonder ? ANNE huskily . Yes . VALSIN taking a step forward . Is the pretty ? ANNE places her back against the closed door , facing him grimly . He assumes a tone of indulgence . Ah , one must not look : the niece , likewise , has not completed her toilet . ANNE She is  --  asleep . p. 34 VALSIN glancing toward the dismantled doorway . A sound napper ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaving ? He advances , smiling . ANNE between her teeth . You shall not go in ! You can not see her ! She is  --  VALSIN laughing . Allow me to prompt you . She is not only asleep ; she is ill . She is starving . Also , I can not go in because she is an orphan . Surely , she is an orphan ? A lonely widow and her lonely orphan niece . Ah , touching  --  and sweet ! ANNE hotly . What authority have you to force your way into my apartment and insult  --  VALSIN touching his scarf . I had the honor to mention the French Republic . ANNE So ! Does the French Republic persecute widows and orphans ? VALSIN gravely . No . It is the making of them ! ANNE crying out . Ah , horrible ! VALSIN I regret that its just severity was the cause of your own bereavement , Citizeness . When your unfortunate husband , Andr , formerly known as the Prince de Laseyne  --  p. 35 ANNE defiantly , though tears have sprung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what you mean by these titles . My name is Balsage . VALSIN Bravo ! The Widow Balsage , living here in calm obscurity with her niece . Widow Balsaga , answer quickly , without stopping to think . Sharply . How long have you lived here ? ANNE Two months . Faltering.  --  A year ! VALSIN laughing . Good . Two months and a year ! No visitors ? No strangers ? ANNE No . VALSIN wheeling quickly and picking up LOUIS 'S cap from the dressing-table . This cap , then , belongs to your niece . ANNE flustered , advancing toward him as if to take it . It was  --  it was left here this afternoon by our landlord . VALSIN musingly . That is very , very puzzling . He leans against the dressing-table in a careless attitude , his back to her . ANNE cavalierly . Why " puzzling " ? p. 36 VALSIN Because I sent him on an errand to Paris this morning . She flinches , but he does not turn to look at her , continuing in a tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris was quite an event for you , Widow Balsage . You do not take many journeys ? ANNE I am too poor . VALSIN And you have not been contemplating another departure from Boulogne ? ANNE No . VALSIN still in the same careless attitude , his back toward her and the closed door . Good . It is as I thought : the port-manteau is for ornament . ANNE choking . It belongs to my niece . She came only an hour ago . She has not unpacked . VALSIN Naturally . Too ill . ANNE She had traveled all night ; she was exhausted . She went to sleep at once . VALSIN Is she a somnambulist ? ANNE taken aback . Why ? VALSIN indifferently . She has just opened the door of her room in order to overhear our conversation . Waving his hand to the dressing-table mirror , in which he had been gazing . Observe it , Citizeness Laseyne. p. 37 ANNE demoralized . I do not  --  I  --  Stamping her foot . How often shall I tell you my name is Balsage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps I might remember better if I saw it written : I beg a glance at your papers . Doubtless you have your certificate of citizenship  --  ANNE trembling . I have papers , certainly . VALSIN The sight of them  --  ANNE I have my passport ; you shall see . With wildly shaking hands she takes from her blouse the passport and the " permit , " crumpled together . It is in proper from  --  She is nervously replacing the two papers in her bosom when with a sudden movement he takes them from her . She cries out incoherently , and attempts to recapture them . VALSIN extending his left arm to fend her off . Yes , here you have your passport . And there you have others . He points to the littered floor under the desk . Many of them ! ANNE Old letters ! She clutches at the papers in his grasp. p. 38 VALSIN easily fending her off . Doubtless ! He shakes the " permit " open . Oho ! A permission to embark  --  and signed by three names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Billaud Varennes , Carnot , and Robespierre ! Each has lately suffered an injury to his right hand . What a misfortune for France ! And what a coincidence ! One has not heard the like since we closed the theatres . ANNE furiously struggling to reach his hand . Give me my papers ! Give me  --  VALSIN holding them away from her . You see , these unlucky great men had their names signed , for them by somebody else . And I should judge that this somebody else must have been writing quite recently  --  less than half an hour ago , from the freshness of the ink  --  and in considerable haste ; perhaps suffering considerable anguish of mind , Widow Balsage ! MADAME DE LASEYNE , overwhelmed , sinks into a chair . He comes close to her , his manner changing startlingly . VALSIN bending over with sudden menace , his voice loud and harsh . Widow Balsage , if you intend no journey , why have you this forged permission to embark on the Jeune Pierrette ? Widow Balsage , who is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . VALSIN straightening up . Your first truth . Resuming his gaiety . Of course he is not in that room yonder with your niece . ANNE brokenly . No , no , no ; he is not ! He is not here . VALSIN commiseratingly . Poor woman ! You have not even the pleasure to perceive how droll you are . ANNE I perceive that I am a fool ! She dashes the tears from her eyes and springs to her feet . I also perceive that you have denounced us before the authorities here  --  VALSIN Pardon . In Boulogne it happens that I am the authority . I introduce myself for the third time : Valsin , Commissioner of the National Committee of Public Safety . Tallien was sent to Bordeaux ; Collot to Lyons ; I to Boulogne . Citizeness , were all of the august names on your permit genuine , you could no more leave this port without my counter-signature than you could take wing and fly over the Channel ! ANNE with a shrill laugh of triumph . You have overreached yourself ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris  --  p. 40 VALSIN gaily . Oh , I intended you to notice that ! ANNE unheeding . You have claimed to be Commissioner of the highest power in France . We can prove that you are a common spy . You may go to the guillotine for that . Take care , Citizen ! So ! You have denounced us ; we denounce you . I 'll have you arrested by your own soldiers . I 'll call them  --  She makes a feint of running to the window . He watches her coolly , in silence ; and she halts , chagrined . VALSIN pleasantly . I was sure you would have waited a long time for it . ANNE becoming hysterical . I am the Widow Balsage , I tell you ! You do not know us  --  you followed us from Paris . Half sobbing . You 're a spy  --  a hanger-on of the police . We will prove  --  VALSIN stepping to the dismantled doorway . I left my assistant within hearing  --  a species of animal of mine . I may claim that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skillful , who has had the honor of a slight acquaintance with you , I believe . Calling . Dossonville ! DOSSONVILLE , a large man , flabby of flesh , loose-mouthed , grizzled , carelessly dressed , makes his appearance in the doorway . He has a harsh and reckless eye ; and , obviously a flamboyant bully by temperament , his object , doggish deference to VALSIN is instantly impressive , more than confirming the latter 's remark that DOSSONVILLE " belongs " to him . DOSSONVILLE , apparently , is a chattel indeed , body and soul . At sight of him MADAME DE LASEYNE catches at the desk for support and stands speechless. p. 41 VALSIN easily . Dossonville , you may inform the Citizeness Laseyne what office I have the fortune to hold . DOSSONVILLE coming in . Bright heaven ! All the world knows that you are the representative of the Committee of Public Safety . Commissioner to Boulogne . VALSIN With what authority ? DOSSONVILLE Absolute  --  unlimited ! Naturally . What else would be useful ? VALSIN You recall this woman , Dossonville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Emigrant Valny-Cherault , in Paris . VALSIN Did you forge that passport ? DOSSONVILLE No . I told the Emigrant I had . Under orders . Grinning . It was genuine . VALSIN Where did you get it ? DOSSONVILLE From you . VALSIN suavely . Sit down , Dossonville . The latter , who is standing by a chair , obeys with a promptness more than military . VALSIN turns smilingly to MADAME DE LASEYNE . Dossonville 's instructions , however , did not include a " permit " to sail on the Jeune Pierrette . All of which , I confess , Citizeness , has very much the appearance of a trap ! He tosses the two papers upon the desk . Utterly dismayed , she makes no effort to secure them . He regards her with quizzical enjoyment. p. 42 ANNE Ah  --  you  --  She fails to speak coherently . VALSIN Dossonville has done very well . He procured your passport , brought your " disguises , " planned your journey , even gave you directions how to find these lodgings in Boulogne . Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He pauses for a moment . If I am a spy , Citizeness Laseyne , at least I trust your gracious intelligence may not cling to the epithet " ordinary . " My soul ! but I appear to myself a most uncommon type of spy  --  a very intricate , complete , and unusual spy , in fact . ANNE to herself , weeping . Ah , poor Louis ! VALSIN cheerfully . You are beginning to comprehend ? That is well . Your niece 's door is still ajar by the discreet width of a finger , so I assume that the Emigrant also begins to comprehend . Therefore I take my ease ! He seats himself in the most comfortable chair in the room , crossing his legs in a leisurely attitude , and lightly drumming the tips of his fingers together , the while his peaceful gaze is fixed upon the ceiling . His tone , as he continues , is casual . You understand , my Dossonville , having long ago occupied this very apartment myself , I am serenely aware that the Emigrant can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this is the fourth floor , and a proper number of bayonets in the courtyard below are arranged to receive any person active enough to descend by a rope of bed-clothes , one is confident that the said Emigrant will remain where he is . Let us make ourselves comfortable , for it is a delightful hour  --  an hour I have long promised myself . I am in a good humor . Let us all be happy . Citizeness Laseyne , enjoy yourself . Call me some bad names ! p. 43 ANNE between her teeth . If I could find one evil enough ! VALSIN slapping his knee delightedly . There it is : the complete incompetence of your class . You poor aristocrats , you do not even know how to swear . Your ancestors knew how ! They were fighters ; they knew how to swear because they knew how to attack ; you poor moderns have no profanity left in you , because , poisoned by idleness , you have forgotten even how to resist . And yet you thought yourselves on top , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wave . You forgot that power , like genius , always comes from underneath , because it is produced only by turmoil . We have had to wring the neck of your feather-head court , because while the court was the nation the nation had its pockets picked . You were at the mercy of anybody with a pinch of brains : adventurers like Mazarin , like Fouquet , like Law , or that little commoner , the woman Fish , who called herself Pompadour and took France  --  France , merely !  --  from your King , and used it to her own pleasure . Then , at last , after the swindlers had well plucked you  --  at last , unfortunate creatures , the People got you ! Citizeness , the People had starved : be assured they will eat you to the bone  --  and then eat the bone ! You are helpless because you have learned nothing and forgotten everything . You have forgotten everything in this world except how to be fat ! p. 44 DOSSONVILLE applauding with unction . Beautiful ! It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ass ! DOSSONVILLE meekly . Perfectly , perfectly . VALSIN crossly . That was n't a speech ; it was the truth . Citizeness Laseyne , so far as you are concerned , I am the People . He extends his hand negligently , with open palm . And I have got you . He clenches his fingers , like a cook 's on the neck of a fowl . Like that ! And I 'm going to take you back to Paris , you and the Emigrant . She stands in an attitude eloquent of despair . His glance roves from her to the door of the other room , which is still slightly ajar ; and , smiling at some fugitive thought , he continues , deliberately . I take you : you and your brother  --  and that rather pretty little person : who traveled with you . There is a breathless exclamation from the other side of the door , which is flung open violently , as ELOISE  --  flushed , radiant with anger , and altogether magnificent  --  sweeps into the room to confront VALSIN . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , Anne ! p. 45 DOSSONVILLE dazed by the vision . Lord ! What glory ! He rises , bowing profoundly , muttering hoarsely . Oh , eyes ! Oh , hair ! Look at her shape ! Her chin ! The divine  --  VALSIN getting up and patting him reassuringly on the back . The lady perceives her effect , my Dossonville . It is no novelty . Sit down , my Dossonville . The still murmurous DOSSONVILLE obeys . VALSIN turns to ELOISE , a brilliant light in his eyes . Let me greet one of the nieces of Widow Balsage  --  evidently not the sleepy one , and certainly not ill . Health so transcendent  --  ELOISE placing her hand upon MADAME DE LASEYNE 'S shoulder . This is a clown , Anne . You need have no fear of him whatever . His petty authority does not extend to us . VALSIN deferentially . Will the niece of Widow Balsage explain why it does not ? ELOISE turning upon him fiercely . Because the patriot Citizeness Eloise d'Anville is here ! VALSIN assuming an air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " permit " yonder even mentions her by name . It is curious . I shall have to go into that . Continue , niece . p. 46 ELOISE with supreme haughtiness . This lady is under her protection . VALSIN growing red . Pardon . Under whose protection ? ELOISE sulphurously . Under the protection of Eloise d'Anville ! This has a frightful effect upon VALSIN ; his face becomes contorted ; he clutches at his throat , apparently half strangled , staggers , and falls choking into the easy-chair he has formerly occupied . VALSIN gasping , coughing , incoherent . Under the pro  --  the protection  --  He explodes into peal after peal of uproarious laughter . The protection of  --  Aha , ha , ha , ho , ho , ho ! He rocks himself back and forth unappeasably . ELOISE with a slight lift of the eyebrows . This man is an idiot . VALSIN during an abatement of his attack . Oh , pardon ! It is  --  too  --  much  --  too much for me ! You say  --  these people are  --  ELOISE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , imbecile ! You can not touch them . She wills it ! At this , VALSIN shouts as if pleading for mercy , and beats the air with his hands . He struggles to his feet and , pounding himself upon the chest , walks to and fro in the effort to control his convulsion. p. 47 ELOISE to ANNE , under cover of the noise he makes . I was wrong : he is not an idiot . ANNE despairingly . He laughs at you . ELOISE in a quick whisper . Out of bluster ; because he is afraid . He is badly frightened . I know just what to do . Go into the other room with Louis . ANNE protesting weakly . I ca n't hope  --  ELOISE flashing from a cloud . You failed , did n't you ? MADAME DE LASEYNE , after a tearful perusal of the stern resourcefulness now written in the younger woman 's eyes , succumbs with a piteous gesture of assent and goes out forlornly . ELOISE closes the door and stands with her back to it . VALSIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pacing the room in the struggle to subdue his hilarity . This young citizeness speaks of the protection of Eloise d'Anville ! Leaning feebly upon DOSSONVILLE 'S shoulder . Do you hear , my Dossonville ? It is an ecstasy . Ecstasize , then . Scream , Dossonville ! DOSSONVILLE puzzled , but evidently accustomed to being so , cackles instantly . Perfectly . Ha , ha ! The citizeness is not only stirringly beautiful , she is also  --  p. 48 VALSIN She is also a wit . Susceptible henchman , concentrate your toughts upon domesticity . In this presence remember your wife ! ELOISE peremptorily . Dismiss that person . I have something to say to you . VALSIN wiping his eyes . Dossonville , you are not required . We are going to be sentimental , and heaven knows you are not the moon . In fact , you are a fat old man . Exit , obesity ! Go somewhere and think about your children . Flit , whale ! DOSSONVILLE rising . Perfectly , my chieftain . He goes to the broken door . ELOISE tapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VALSIN The floor below . DOSSONVILLE Well understood . Perfectly , perfectly ! ' He goes out through the hallway ; disappears , chuckling grossly . There are some moments of silence within the room , while he is heard clumping down a flight of stairs ; the VALSIN turns to ELOISE with burlesque ardor . VALSIN " Alone at last ! " VALSIN maintainging her composure . Rabbit ! p. 49 VALSIN dropping into the chair at the desk , with mock dejection . Repulsed at the outset ! Ah , Citizeness , there were moments on the journey from Paris when I thought I detected a certain kindness in your glances at the lonely stranger . ELOISE folding her arms . You are to withdraw your soldiers , countersign the " permit , " and allow my friends to embark at once . VALSIN with solemnity . Do you give it as an order , Citizeness ? ELOISE I do . You will receive suitable political advancement . VALSIN in a choked voice . You mean as a  --  a reward ? ELOISE haughtily . I guarantee that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , with a low moan , presses his hand to his side , seeming upon the point of a dangerous seizure . VALSIN managing to speak . I can only beg you to spare me . You have me at your mercy . ELOISE swelling . It is well for you that you understand that ! VALSIN shaking his hand ruefully . Yes ; you see I have a bad liver : it may become permanently enlarged . Laughter is my great danger . p. 50 ELOISE crying out with rage . Oh ! VALSIN dolorously . I have continually to remind myself that I am no longer in the first flush of youth . ELOISE Idiot ! Do you not know who I am ! VALSIN You ? Oh yes  --  He checks himself abruptly ; looks at her with brief intensity ; turns his eyes away , half closing them in quick meditation ; smiles , as upon some secret pleasantry , and proceeds briskly . Oh yes , yes , I know who you are . ELOISE beginning haughtily . Then you  --  VALSIN at once cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not say . Names at best are details ; and your own is a detail that could hardly be thought to matter . What you are is obvious : you joined Louis and his sister in Paris at the barriers , and traveled with them as " Marie Balsage , " a sister . You might save us a little trouble by giving us your real name ; you will probably refuse , and the police will have to look it up when I take you back to Paris . Frankly , you are of no importance to us , though of course we 'll send you to the Tribunal . No doubt you are a poor relative of the Valny-Cheraults , or , perhaps , you may have been a governess in the Laseyne family , or  --  p. 51 ELOISE under her breath . Idiot ! Idiot ! VALSIN with subterranean enjoyment , watching her side-long.Or the good-looking wife of some faithful retainer of the Emigrant 's , perhaps . ELOISE with a shrill laugh . Does the Committee of Public Safety betray the same intelligence in the appointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  VALSIN quickly raising his voice to check her . You are of no importance , I tell you ! Changing his tone . Of course I mean politically . With broad gallantry . Otherwise , I am the first to admit extreme susceptibility . I saw that you observed it on the way  --  at the taverns , in the diligence , at the posting-houses , at  --  ELOISE with serenity . Yes . I am accustomed to oglers . VALSIN Alas , I believe you ! My unfortunate sex is but too responsive . ELOISE gasping . " Responsive "  --  Oh ! VALSIN indulgently . Let us return to the safer subject . Presently I shall arrest those people in the other room and , regretfully , you too . But first I pamper myself ; I chat ; I have an attractive woman to listen . In the matter of the arrest , I delay my fire ; I do not flash in the pan , but I lengthen my fuse . Why ? For the same reason that when I was a little boy and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the compliments of an epicure . I looked at it a long while . I played with it . Then  --  I devoured it ! I am still like that . And Louis yonder is good to eat , because I happen not to love him . However , I should mention that I doubt if he could recall either myself or the circumstance which annoyed me ; some episodes are sometimes so little to certain people and so significant to certain other people . He smiles , stretching himself luxuriously in his chair . Behold me , Citizeness ! I am explained . I am indulging my humor : I play with my cake . Let us see into what curious little figures I can twist it . p. 52 ELOISE Idiot ! VALSIN pleasantly . I have lost count , but I think that is the sixth idiot you have called me . Aha , it is only history , which one admires for-repeating itself . Good ! Let us march . I shall play  --  He picks up the " permit " from the desk , studies it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , continuing : I shall play with  --  with all four of you . ELOISE impulsively . Four ? VALSIN I am not easy to deceive ; there are four of you here . ELOISE staring . So ? VALSIN Louis brought you and his sister from Paris : a party of three . This " permit " which he forged is for four ; the original three and the woman you mentioned a while ago , Eloise d'Anville . Hence she must have joined you here . The deduction is plain : there are three people in that room : the Emigrant , his sister , and this Eloise d'Anville . To the trained mind such reasoning is simple . ELOISE elated . Perfectly ! VALSIN with an air of cunning . Nothing escapes me . You see that . p. 53 ELOISE At first glance ! I make you my most profound compliments . Sir , you are an eagle ! VALSIN smugly . Thanks . Now , then , pretty governess , you thought this d'Anville might be able to help you . What put that in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know what she is ? VALSIN A heroine I have had the misfortune never to encounter . But I am informed of her character and history . ELOISE sternly . Then you understand that even the Agent of the National Committee risks his head if he dares touch people she chooses to protect . VALSIN extending his hand in plaintive appeal . Be generous to my opacity . How could she protect anybody ? ELOISE with condescension . She has earned the gratitude  --  VALSIN Of whom ? ELOISE superbly . Of the Nation ! VALSIN breaking out again . Ha , ha , ha ! Clutching at his side . Pardon , oh , pardon , liver of mine . I must not die ; my life is still useful . p. 54 ELOISE persisting stormily . Of the People , stupidity ! Of the whole People , dolt ! Of France , blockhead ! VALSIN with a violent effort , conquering his hilarity . There ! I am saved . Let us be solemn , my child ; it is better for my malady . You are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely grateful ; " the People , " never . What you call " the People " means folk who are not always sure of their next meal ; therefore their great political and patriotic question is the cost of food . Their heroes are the champions who are going to make it cheaper ; and when these champions fail them or cease to be useful to them , then they either forget these poor champions  --  or eat them . Let us hear what your Eloise d'Anville has done to earn the reward of being forgotten instead of eaten . ELOISE her lips quivering . She surrendered her property voluntarily . She gave up all she owned to the Nation . VALSIN genially . And immediately went to live with her relatives in great luxury . ELOISE choking . The Republic will protect her . She gave her whole estate  --  VALSIN And the order for its confiscation was already written when she did it . p. 55 ELOISE passionately . Ah  --  liar ! VALSIN smiling . I have seen the order . She leans against the wall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this martyr " gave " us her property ; but one hears that she went to the opera just the same and wore more jewels than ever , and lived richly upon the Laseynes and Valny-Cheraults , until they were confiscated . Why , all the world knows about this woman ; and let me tell you , to your credit , my governess , I think you have a charitable heart : you are the only person I ever heard speak kindly of her . ELOISE setting her teeth . Venom ! VALSIN observing her slyly . It is with difficulty I am restraining my curiosity to see her  --  also to hear her !  --  when she learns of her proscription by a grateful Republic . ELOISE with shrill mockery . Proscribed ? Eloise d'Anville proscribed ? Your inventions should be more plausible , Goodman Spy ! I knew you were lying  --  VALSIN smiling . You do not believe  --  ELOISE proudly . Eloise d'Anville is a known Girondist . The Gironde is the real power in France . p. 56 VALSIN mildly . That party has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will revive . VALSIN Pardon , Citizeness , but you are behind the times , and they are very fast nowadays  --  the times . The Gironde is dead . ELOISE ominously . It may survive you , my friend . Take care ! VALSIN unimpressed . The Gironde had a grand faade , and that was all . It was a party composed of amateurs and orators ; and of course there were some noisy camp-followers and a few comic-opera vivandires , such as this d'Anville . In short , the Gironde looked enormous because it was hollow . It was like a pie that is all crust . We have tapped the crust  --  with a knife , Citizeness . There is nothing left . ELOISE contemptuously . You say so . Nevertheless , the Rolands  --  VALSIN gravely . Roland was found in a field yesterday ; he had killed himself . His wife was guillotined the day after you left Paris . Every one of their political friends is proscribed . ELOISE shaking as with bitter cold . It is a lie ! Not Eloise d'Anville ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warrant for her arrest ? He takes a packet of documents from his breast pocket , selects one , and spreads it open before her . Let me read you her description : " Eloise d'Anville , aristocrat . Figure , comely . Complxion , blond . Eyes , dark blue . Nose , straight . Mouth , wide  --  " ELOISE in a burst of passion , striking the warrant a violent blow with her clenched fist . Let them dare ! Beside herself , she strikes again , tearing the paper from his grasp . She stamps upon it . Let them dare , I say ! VALSIN picking up the warrant . Dare to say her mouth is wide ? ELOISE cyclonic . Dare to arrest her ! VALSIN It does seem a pity . He folds the warrant slowly and replaces it in his pocket . Yes , a great pity . She was the one amusing thing in all this somberness . She will be missed . The Revolution will lack its joke . ELOISE recoiling , her passion exhausted . Ah , infamy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands. p. 58 VALSIN with a soothing gesture . Being only her friend , you speak mildly . The d'Anville herself would call it blasphemy . ELOISE with difficulty . She is  --  so vain  --  then ? VALSIN lightly . Oh , a type  --  an actress . ELOISE her back to him . How do you know ? You said  --  VALSIN that I had not encountered her . Glibly . One knows best the people one has never seen . Intimacy confuses judgment . I confess to that amount of hatred for the former Marquis de Valny-Cherault that I take as great an interest in all that concerns him as if I loved him . And the little d'Anville concerns him  --  yes , almost one would say , consumes him . The unfortunate man is said to be so blindly faithful that he can speak her name without laughing . ELOISE stunned . Oh ! VALSIN going on , cheerily . No one else can do that , Citizeness . Jacobins , Cordeliers , Hbertists , even the shattered relics of the Gironde itself , all alike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  this Jeanne d'Arc in rice-powder ! p. 59 ELOISE tragically . They laugh  --  and proclaim her an outlaw ! VALSIN waving his hand carelessly . Oh , it is only that we are sweeping up the last remnants of aristocracy , and she goes with the rest  --  into the dust-heap . She should have remained a royalist ; the final spectacle might have had dignity . As it is , she is not of her own class , not of ours : neither fish nor flesh nor  --  but yes , perhaps , after all , she is a fowl . ELOISE brokenly . Alas ! Homing  --  with wounded wing ! She sinks into a chair with pathetic grace , her face in her hands . VALSIN surreptitiously grinning . Not at all what I meant . Brutally . Peacocks do n't fly . ELOISE regaining her feet at a bound . You imitation dandy ! You  --  VALSIN with benevolence . My dear , your indignation for your friend is chivalrous . It is admirable ; but she is not worth it . You do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you have never seen her as she is . ELOISE witheringly . But you , august Zeus , having never seen her , will reveal her to me ! p. 60 VALSIN smoothly urbane . If you have ears . You see , she is not altogether unique , but of a variety known to men who are wise enough to make a study of women . ELOISE snapping out a short , loud laugh in his face . Pouff ! VALSIN unruffled . I profess myself an apprentice . The science itself is but in its infancy . Women themselves understand very well that they are to be classified , and they fear that we shall perceive it : they do not really wish to be known . Yet it is coming ; some day our cyclopedists will have you sorted , classed , and defined with precision ; but the d'Alembert of the future will not be a woman , because no woman so disloyal will ever be found . Men have to acquire loyalty to their sex : yours is an instinct . Citizen governess , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this unwritten work . To begin  --  ELOISE feverishly interested , but affecting languor . Must you ? VALSIN To Eloise d'Anville the most interesting thing about a rose-bush has always been that Eloise d'Anville could smell it . Moonlight becomes important when it falls upon her face ; sunset is worthy when she grows rosy in it . To her mind , the universe was set in motion to be the background for a decoration , and she is the decoration . She believes that the cathedral was built for the fresco . And when a dog interests her , it is because he would look well beside her in a painting . Such dogs have no minds . I refer you to all the dogs in the portraits of Beauties . p. 61 ELOISE not at all displeased ; pretending carelessness . Ah , you have heard that she is beautiful ? VALSIN Far worse : that she is a Beauty . Let nothing ever tempt you , my dear , into setting up in that line . For you are very well-appearing , I assure you ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the d'Anville , who knows but that you might have become as famous a Beauty as she ? What makes a Beauty is not the sumptuous sculpture alone , but a very peculiar arrogance  --  not in the least arrogance of mind , my little governess . In this , your d'Anville emerged from childhood full-panoplied indeed ; and the feather-head court fell headlong at her feet . It was the fated creature 's ruin . ELOISE placidly . And it is because of her beauty that you drag her to the guillotine ? VALSIN Bless you , I merely convey her ! ELOISE Tell me , logician , was it not her beauty that inspired her to give her property to the Nation ? VALSIN It was . ELOISE What perception ! I am faint with admiration . And no doubt it was her beauty that made her a Republican ? VALSIN What else ? p. 62 ELOISE Hail , oracle ! She releases an arpeggio of satiric laughter . VALSIN That laugh is diaphanous . I see you through it , already convinced . She stops laughing immediately . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a Beauty is the living evidence of man 's immortality ; the one plain proof that he has a soul . ELOISE It is not so bad then , after all ? VALSIN It is utterly bad . But of all people a Beauty is most conscious of her duality . her whole life is based upon her absolute knowledge that her Self and her body are two . She sacrifices all things to her beauty because her beauty feeds her Self with a dreadful food which it has made her unable to live without . ELOISE My little gentleman , you talk like a sentimental waiter . Your metaphors are all hot from the kitchen . VALSIN nettled . It is natural ; unlike your Eloise , I am really of " the People "  --  and starved much in my youth . ELOISE But , like her , you are still hungry . VALSIN A Beauty is a species of cannibal priestess , my dear . She will make burnt-offerings of her father and her mother , her sisters  --  her lovers  --  to her beauty , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have or perish . p. 63 ELOISE Boum ! She snaps her fingers . And of course she bathes in the blood of little children ? VALSIN grimly . Often . ELOISE averting her gaze from his . This mysterious food  --  VALSIN Not at all mysterious . Sensation . There you have it . And that is why Eloise d'Anville is a renegade . You understand perfectly . ELOISE You are too polite . No . VALSIN gaily . Behold , then ! Many women who are not Beauties are beautiful , but in such women you do not always discover beauty at your first glance : it is disclosed with a subtle tardiness . It does not dazzle ; it is reluctant ; but it grows as you look again and again . You get a little here , a little there , like glimpses of children hiding in a garden . It is shy , and sometimes closed in from you altogether , and then , unexpectedly , this belated loveliness springs into bloom before your very eyes . It retains the capacity of surprise , the vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before her at a stroke : it is soon over . Thus your Eloise , brought to court , startled Versailles ; the sensation was overwhelming . Then Versailles got used to her , just as it had to its other prodigies : the fountains were there , the King was there , the d'Anville was there ; and naturally , one had seen them ; saw them every day  --  one talked of matters less accepted . That was horrible to Eloise . She had tasted ; the appetite , once stirred , was insatiable . At any cost she must henceforth have always the sensation of being a sensation . She must be the pivot of a reeling world . So she went into politics . Ah , Citizeness , there , was one man who understood Beauties  --  not Homer , who wrote of Helen ! Romance is gallant by profession , and Homer lied like a poet . For the truth about the Trojan War is that the wise Ulysses made it , not because Paris stole Helen , but because the Trojans were threatening to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man that understood Beauties ? VALSIN Bluebeard . He crosses the room to the dressing-table , leans his back against it in an easy attitude , his elbows resting upon the top . ELOISE slowly , a little tremulously . And so Eloise d'Anville should have her head cut off ? VALSIN Well , she thought she was in politics , did n't she ? Suavely . You may be sure she thoroughly enjoyed her hallucination that she was a great figure in the Revolution  --  which was cutting off the heads of so many of her relatives and old friends ! Do n't waste your pity , my dear . ELOISE looking at him fixedly . Citizen , you must have thought a great deal about my unhappy friend . She might be flattered by so searching an interest . VALSIN negligently . Not interest in her , governess , but in the Emigrant who cools his heels on the other side of that door , greatly to my enjoyment , waiting my pleasure to arrest him . The poor wretch is the one remaining lover of this girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a habit ; and he will never get over it until he has had possession . She has made him suffer frightfully , but I shall never forgive her for not having dealt him the final stroke . It would have saved me all the bother I have been put to in avenging the injury he did me. p. 65 ELOISE frowning . What " final stroke " could she have ' dealt " him ? VALSIN with sudden vehement intensity . She could have loved him ! He strikes the table with his fist . I see it ! I see it ! Beauty 's husband ! Pounding the table with each exclamation , his voice rising in excitement . What a vision ! This damned , proud , loving Louis , a pomade bearer ! A buttoner ! An errand-boy to the perfumer 's , to the chemist 's , to the milliner 's ! A groom of the powder-closet  --  ELOISE snatching at the opportunity . How noisy you are ! VALSIN discomfited , apologetically . You see , it is only so lately that we of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , now that we are free to shout , we overdo it . We let our voices out , we let our joys out , we let our hates out . We let everything out  --  except our prisoners ! He smiles winningly . ELOISE slowly . Do you guess what all this bluster  --  this tirade upon the wickedness of beauty  --  makes me think ? VALSIN Certainly . Being a woman , you can not imagine a bitterness which is not " personal . " p. 66 ELOISE laughing . " Being a woman , " I think that the person who has caused you the greatest suffering in your life must be very good-looking ! VALSIN calmly . Quite right . It was precisely this d'Anville . I will tell you . He sits on the arm of a chair near her , and continues briskly . I was not always a politician . Six years ago I was a soldier in the Valny regiment of cavalry . That was the old army , that droll army , that royal army ; so ridiculous that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughe-pots for officers  --  and for a colonel , who but our Emigrant yonder ! Aha ! we suffered in the ranks , let me tell you , when Eloise had been coy ; and one morning it was my turn . You may have heard that she was betrothed first to Louis and later to several others ? My martyrdom occurred the day after she had announced to the court her betrothal to the young Duc de Creil , whose father afterward interfered . Louis put us on drill in a hard rain : he had the habit of relieving his chagrin like that . My horse fell , and happened to shower our commander with mud . Louis let out all his rage upon me : it was an excuse , and , naturally , he disliked mud . But I was rolling in it , with my horse : I also disliked it  --  and I was indiscreet enough to attempt some small reply . That finished my soldiering , Citizeness . He had me tied to a post before the barracks for the rest of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven had neglected to warm the rain for that bath ; that it was February ; and that Louis 's orders had left me nothing to wear upon my back except an unfulsome descriptive placard and my modesty . Altogether it was a disadvantageous position , particularly for the exchange of repartee with such of my comrades as my youthful amiability had not endeared ; I have seldom seen more cheerful indifference to bad weather . Inclement skies failed to injure the spectacle : it was truly the great performance of my career ; some people would not even go home to eat , and peddlers did a good trade in cakes and wine . In the evening they whipped me conscientiously  --  my tailor has never since made me an entirely comfortable coat . Then they gave me the place of honor at the head of a procession by torchlight and drummed me out of camp with my placard upon my back . So I adopted another profession : I had a friend who was a doctor in the stables of d'Artois ; and I knew horses . He made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a veterinarian ! VALSIN smiling . No ; a horse-doctor . It was thus I " retired " from the army and became a politician . My friend was only a horse-doctor himself , but his name happened to be Marat . ELOISE Ah , frightful ! For the first time she begins to feel genuine alarm . VALSIN The sequence is simple . If Eloise d'Anville had n't coquetted with young Creil I should n't be Commissioner here to-day , settling my account with Louis . I am in his debt for more than the beating : I should tell you there was a woman in my case , a slender lace-maker with dark eyes  --  very pretty eyes . She had furnished me with a rival , a corporal ; and he brought her for a stroll in the rain past our barracks that day when I was attracting so much unsought attention . They waited for the afterpiece , enjoyed a pasty and a bottle of Beaune , and went away laughing cozily together . I did not see my pretty lace-maker again , not for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still with her , and it was their turn to be undesirably conspicuous . They were part of a procession passing along the Rue St. Honor on its way to the Place of the Revolution . They were standing up in the cart ; the lace-maker had grown fat , and she was scolding her poor corporal bitterly . What a habit that must have been  --  they were not five minutes from the guillotine . I own that a thrill of gratitude to Louis temporarily softened me toward him , though at the very moment I was following him through the crowd . At least he saved me from the lace-maker ! p. 68 ELOISE shrinking from him . You are horrible ! VALSIN To my regret you must find me more and more so . ELOISE panting . You are going to take us back to Paris , then ? To the Tribunal  --  and to the  --  She covers her eyes with her hands . VALSIN gravely . I can give you no comfort , governess . You are involved with the Emigrant , and , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Louis as I can invent  --  and I am an ingenious man . His manner becomes sinister . I am near the top . The cinders of Marat are in the Pantheon , but Robespierre still flames ; and he claims me as his friend . I can do what I will . And I have much in store for Louis before he shall be so fortunate as to die ! ELOISE faintly . And  --  and Eloise  --  d'Anville ? Her hands fall from her face : he sees large , beautiful tears upon her cheeks . VALSIN coldly . Yes She is crushed for the moment ; then , recovering herself with a violent effort , lifts her head defiantly and stands erect , facing him. p. 69 ELOISE You take her head because your officer punished you , six years ago , for a breach of military discipline ! VALSIN in a lighter tone . Oh no . I take it , just as she injured me  --  incidentally . In truth , Citizeness , it is n't I who take it : I only arrest her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've just finished telling me you were preparing tortures for her ! I thought you an intelligent man . Pah ! You 're only a gymnast . She turns away from him haughtily and moves toward the door . VALSIN touching his scarf of office . True . I climb . She halts suddenly , as if startled by this ; she stands as she is , her back to him , for several moments , and does not change her attitude when she speaks . ELOISE slowly . You climb alone . VALSIN with a suspicious glance at her . Yes  --  alone . ELOISE in a low voice . Why did n't you take the lace-maker with you ? You might have been happier . Very slowly she turns and comes toward him , her eyes full upon his : she moves deliberately and with incomparable grace . He seems to be making an effort to look away , and failing : he can not release his eyes from the glorious and starry glamour that holds them . She comes very close to him , so close that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You might have been happier with  --  a friend  --  to climb with you . VALSIN demoralized . Citizeness  --  I am  --  I  --  ELOISE in a voice of velvet . Yes , Say it . You are  --  VALSIN desperately . I have told you that I am the most susceptible of men . ELOISE impulsively putting her hand on his shoulder . Is it a crime ? Come , my friend , you are a man who does climb : you will go over all . You believe in the Revolution because you have used it to lift you . But other things can help you , too . Do n't you need them ? VALSIN understanding perfectly , gasping . Need what ? She draws her hand from his shoulder , moves back from him slightly , and crosses her arms upon her bosom with a royal meekness . ELOISE grandly . Do I seem so useless ? VALSIN in a distracted voice . Heaven help me ! What do you want ? ELOISE Let these people go . Hurriedly , leaning near him . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embark , and I  --  She pauses , flushing beautifully , but does not take her eyes from him . I  --  I do not wish to leave France . My place is in Paris . You will go into the National Committee . You can be its ruler . You will rule it ! I believe in you ! Glowing like a rose of fire . I will go with you . I will help you ! I will marry you ! p. 71 VALSIN in a fascinated whisper . Good Lord ! He stumbles back from her , a strange light in his eyes . ELOISE You are afraid  --  VALSIN with sudden loudness . I am ! Upon my soul , I am afraid ! ELOISE smiling gloriously upon him . Of what , my friend ? Tell me of what ? VALSIN explosively . Of myself ! I am afraid of myself because I am a prophet . This is precisely what I foretold to myself you would do ! I knew it , yet I am aghast when it happens  --  aghast at my own cleverness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hysterical with outrageous vanity . I swear I knew it , and it fits so exactly that I am afraid of myself ! Aha , Valsin , you rogue ! I should hate to have you on my track ! Citizen governess , you are a wonderful person , but not so wonderful as this devil of a Valsin ! ELOISE vaguely , in a dead voice . I can not understand what you are talking about . Do you mean  --  p. 72 VALSIN And what a spell was upon me ! I was near calling Dossonville to preserve me . ELOISE speaking with a strange naturalness , like a child 's . You mean  --  you do n't want me ? VALSIN Ah , Heaven help me , I am going to laugh again ! Oh , ho , ho ! I am spent ! He drops into a chair and gives way to another attack of uproarious hilarity . Ah , ha , ha , ha ! Oh , my liver , ha , ha ! No , Citizeness , I do not want you ! Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utters a choked scream and rushes at him . Swine ! VALSIN warding her off with outstretched hands . Spare me ! Ha , ha , ha ! I am helpless ! Ho , ho , ho ! Citizeness , it would not be worth your while to strangle a man who is already dying ! ELOISE beside herself . Do you dream that I meant it ? VALSIN feebly . Meant to strangle me ? ELOISE frantic . To give myself to you ! VALSIN In short , to  --  to marry me ! He splutters. p. 73 ELOISE furiously . It was a ruse  --  VALSIN soothingly . Yes , yes , a trick . I saw that all along . ELOISE even more infuriated . For their sake , beast ! She points to the other room . To save them ! VALSIN wiping his eyes . Of course , of course . He rises , stepping quickly to the side of the chair away from her and watching her warily . I knew it was to save them . We 'll put it like that . ELOISE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VALSIN Yes , yes . Keeping his distance . I saw it from the first . Suppressing symptoms of returning mirth . It was perfectly plain . You must n't excite yourself  --  nothing could have been clearer ! A giggle escapes him , and he steps hastily backward as she advances upon him . ELOISE Poodle ! Valet ! Scum of the alleys ! Sheep of the prisons ! Jailer ! Hangman ! Assassin ! Brigand ! Horse-doctor ! She hurls the final epithet at him in a climax of ferocity which wholly exhausts her ; and she sinks into the chair by the desk , with her arms upon the desk and her burning face hidden in her arms . VALSIN , morbidly chuckling , in spite of himself , at each of her insults , has retreated farther and farther , until he stands with his back against the door of the inner room , his right hand behind him , resting on the latch . As her furious eyes leave him he silently opens the door , letting it remain a few inches ajar and keeping his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intends to say will be overheard by those within , he erases all expression from his face , and strides to the dismantled doorway in the passage. p. 74 VALSIN calling loudly . Dossonville ! He returns , coming down briskly to ELOISE . His tone is crisp and soldier-like . Citizeness , I have had my great hour . I proceed with the arrests . I have given you four plenty of time to prepare yourselves . Time ? Why , the Emigrant could have changed clothes with one of the women in there a dozen times if he had hoped to escape in that fashion  --  as historical prisoners have won clear , it is related . Fortunately , that is impossible just now ; and he will not dare to attempt it . DOSSONVILLE appearing in the hallway . Present , my chieftain ! VALSIN sharply . Attend , Dossonville . The returned Emigrant , Valny-Cherault , is forfeited ; but because I cherish a special grievance against him , I have decided upon a special punishment for him . It does not please me that he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey to the Tribunal . No , no ; the presence of his old sweetheart would make even the scaffold sweet to him . Therefore I shall take him alone . I shall let these women go . DOSSONVILLE What refinement ! Admirable ! ELOISE slowly rises , staring incredulously at VALSIN . VALSIN picking up the " permit " from the desk . " Permit the Citizen Balsage and his sister , the Citizeness Virginie Balsage , and his second sister , Marie Balsage , and Eloise d'Anville  --  " Ha ! You see , Dossonville , since one of these three women is here , there are two in the other room with the Emigrant . They are to come out , leaving him there . First , however , we shall disarm him . You and I have had sufficient experience in arresting aristocrats to know that they are not always so sensible as to give themselves up peaceably , and I happened to see the outline of a pistol under the Emigrant 's frock the other day in the diligence . We may as well save one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He steps toward the door , speaking sharply . Emigrant , you have heard . For your greater chagrin , these three devoted women are to desert you . Being an aristocrat , you will pretend to prefer this arrangement . They are to leave at once . Throw your pistol into this room , and I will agree not to make the arrest until they are in safety . They can reach your vessel in five minutes . When they have gone , I give you my word not to open this door for ten . A pistol is immediately thrown out of the door , and falls at VALSIN 'S feet . He picks it up , his eyes alight with increasing excitement. p. 75 VALSIN tossing the pistol to DOSSONVILLE . Call the lieutenant . DOSSONVILLE goes to the window , leans out , and beckons . VALSIN writes hastily at the desk , not sitting down . " Permit the three women Balsage to embark without delay upon the Jeune Pierrette . Signed : Valsin . " There , Citizeness , is a " permit " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELOISE , swings toward the door of the inner room , and raps loudly upon it . Come , my feminines ! Your sailors await you  --  brave , but no judges of millinery . There 's a fair wind for you ; and a grand toilet is wasted at sea . Come , charmers ; come ! The door is half opened , and MADAME DE LASEYNE , white and trembling violently , enters quickly , shielding as much as she can the inexpressibly awkward figure of her brother , behind whom she extends her hand , closing the door sharply . He wears the brocaded skirt which MADAME DE LASEYNE has taken from the portmanteau , and ELOISE 'S long mantle , the lifted hood and MADAME DE LASEYNE 'S veil shrouding his head and face . VALSIN in a stifled voice . At last ! At last one beholds the regal d'Anville ! No Amazon  --  DOSSONVILLE aghast . It looks like  --  p. 76 VALSIN shouting . It does n't ! He bows gallantly to LOUIS . A cruel veil , but , oh , what queenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , clutching at his side . But ELOISE rushes to LOUIS and throws herself upon her knees at his feet . She pulls his head down to hers and kisses him through the veil . VALSIN madly . Oh , touching devotion ! Oh , sisters ! Oh , love ! Oh , honey ! Oh , petticoats  --  DOSSONVILLE interrupting humbly . The lieutenant , Citizen Commissioner . He points to the hallway , where the officer appears , standing at attention . VALSIN wheeling . Officer , conduct these three persons to the quay . Place them on board the Jeune Pierrette . The captain will weigh anchor instantly . The officer salutes . ANNE hoarsely to LOUIS , who is lifting the weeping ELOISE to her feet . Quick ! In the name of  --  VALSIN Off with you ! MADAME DE LASEYNE seizes the portmanteau and rushes to the broken doorway , half dragging the others with her . They go out in a tumultuous hurry , followed by the officer . ELOISE sends one last glance over her shoulder at VALSIN as she disappears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In wild spirits he blows a kiss to her . The fugitives are heard clattering madly down the stairs p. 77 DOSSONVILLE excitedly . We can take the Emigrant now . Going to the inner door . Why wait  --  VALSIN That room is empty . DOSSONVILLE What ! VALSIN shouting with laughter . He 's gone ! Not bare-backed , but in petticoats : that 's worse ! He 's gone , I tell you ! The other was the d'Anville . DOSSONVILLE Then you recog  --  VALSIN Imbecile , she 's as well known as the Louvre ! They 're off on their honeymoon ! She 'll take him now ! She will ! She will , on the soul of a prophet ! He rushes to the window and leans far out , shouting at the top of his voice : Quits with you , Louis ! Quits ! Quits ! He falls back from the window and relapses into a chair , cackling ecstatically . DOSSONVILLE hoarse with astonishment . You 've let him go ! You 've let ' em all go ! VALSIN weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inform . With a sudden reversion to extreme seriousness , he levels a sinister forefingr at his companion . And , also , take care of your health , friend ; remember constantly that you have a weak throat , and do n't you ever mention this to my wife ! These are bad times , my Dossonville , and neither you nor I will see the end of them . Good Lord ! Ca n't we have a little fun as we go along ? A fresh convulsion seizes him , and he rocks himself pitiably in his chair.
