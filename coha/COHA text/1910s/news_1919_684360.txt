txt Ruling on Imports Held In Holland . To the Editor of The New York Times : I have read In your Issue of the 20th Inst. a letter from Irving E. Doob , Esq. , relating to the position of Importers who bought German merchandise before the war . In this letter ho states that such merchandise , now owned by American Importers , Iles " on Dutch piers as Inaccessible as if it were still upon soil of the enemy . This is the helpless condition of the importer today . It is plain confiscation . " In this connection , as the ? address of Mt . Doob does not appear , may I ask that you transmit to him the correct information ? Under a ruling of the War Trade Board , effective Dec. 10 , 1918 , favorable consideration may he given to applications for license to import goods of enemy origin , provided proof ' is furnished that the commodities were purchased by residents of tho United States , and fully paid for by them and shipped from Germany into Holland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also , that It shall appear as a result of due Investigation by the War Trade Board representatives at : rho Hague that the granting of permission for the importation of said roods into the United States will not in any way , either by the release of funds or the creation of credits , or otherwise , accrue to the benefit of any person defined as an " enemy " under the " Trading with the Enemy act . " However , where such investigation has not already been made , either by the State Department or the War Trade Board , It will now be conducted only upon the applicant 's undertaking to pay the necessary costs . From this ruling it is evident that the position of the importer today la not a helpless one , and that the rulings of the War Trade Board do not result in confiscation . EDGAR J. NATHAN , Jr . War Trade Board , Washington , Doc . 27 , , 1911.                   @ @
