txt Denunciations of the tariff bill and the men who passed it characterized the speeches made tor  --  Ight by Senators Jonathan P. Dolliver and Albert B , Cummins , in opening the progressive campaign in Iowa . The Coliseum was crowded by 10,000 progressives . The meeting to-night followed district conferences throughout the day , at which steps were taken to reconstruct the old Cummins organization and to organize the State by counties and precincts . Even President Taft did not escape the aspersions of the Senators , while Senator Aldrich was named as the leader of corporate greed and avarice . Senator Aldrich was frequently mentioned as the man " allied with the Guggenheims and the Ryans and Paul Morton in a mammoth trust , incorporated as a rubber company , which is allowed by the articles of incorporation to participate in any kind of business , anywhere on the face of the earth , and which is one of the holding companies in the Guggenheim syndicate for the control of the wealth of Alaska . " Senator Cummins traced the developnient of corporations in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ league with these corporations . He asserted that the present split in the Republican ranks must be taken into consideration . If those Republican leaders who , he charged , were in league with corporations , Senator Cummins - said : ? Most of them have been brought with these influences all around them , and therefore whenever a law is proposed that restricts or reduces corporate power their first inquiry is not , will this measure bring help to the people , but , is it recommended by the captains of industry , the masters of high finance . " These leaders of ours always find themselves so busy hearing what these princes of the earth have to say about proposed legislation that they have scant time to consider the desires and conditions of the a*rat mass of humanity . " I have no hesitancy In naming the present leaders of the Republican Party In the Congress of the United States . In the Senate one man stands solitary and alone , and hitherto his word has been law to that august tribunal . Senator Aldrich is the man of whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cannon , the Speaker , has exercised a dominating control . arid after him come ** Dalzell , and a few others of the same type . They look at  --  these vital problems from the corporate standpoint , and they always are fearful that any step toward the further and better regulation of these overmastering forces in our commercial life will destroy business , will take away some of the profits with which the multi-millionaires have been enriching themselves . " Every session of Congress will develop just such differences , and can you wonder that we , who are marked for the disfavor of the powerful influences at Washington , should want a Governor who is In sympathy with what we are trying to do ; should want the whole State Government to be in harmony with the progressive movement for better laws ? " You will understand that I have given you the reason why I want to see Warren Garst nominated for Governor . The present members of the House of Representatives from this district ( J. A. T. Hull ) and from the Ninth District ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. Kennedy ) are devoted followers of Aldrich and Cannon , and they have voted , and will vote if they are returned to Congress , just as the Aldrich and Cannon organization determines they ought to vote . " Senator Cummins mentioned Hull . Smith , and Kennedy by name , and also Mr. Towner . He concluded : " The sooner we realize that this division in the ranks of the Republican Party is not ephemeral , the sooner we appreciate that it is a movement , of the people , the sooner we will become conscious of a great and everlasting truth . " Analyzing , schedule ' by schedule and item by item , the Payne Tariff act . Senator Dolliver declared that close scrutiny shows that , " so far as the public is concerned , the tariff revision in fact carries rates as high or higher than the Dinglay tariff law on most articles of general use in their finished condition . " " Most of the reductions , " said the Senator , " were so trivial as to be ridiculous and either were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but , on the contrary , export in enormous quantities , or were for the purpose of protecting further the manufacturer , especially by reducing the duties on raw materials . In fact , a careful scrutiny of the partiitilar items that v ere changed and the exact trifling change of rate in each case shows how cunningly the revision was arranged in order to deceive the public and look like real revision downward . " " I am not here to criticise the President or td say unkind words against him , " said Senator Dolliver , " but I count it np reflection on him to state that I find it sometimes necessary to disagree with him and those surrounding him . Men have crowded to the front in his administration who have not had the welfare of the party or of the country at heart . " I am going to have some trouble in keeping inside the breastworks of the Republican Party , but I know something of its doctrines . I do not intend to retire from it , although I have been invited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other man who comes out here into the West to read men out of the Republican , . Party who were known before he ever was in it . "
