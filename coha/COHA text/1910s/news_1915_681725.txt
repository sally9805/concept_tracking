" He argued in favor of the creation of a General Staff , and thereby was at odds with the views of the Navy Department .

Admiral Fiske was asked if the fleet could carry out the movements and scouting necessary before contact with an enemy - with the confidence that is born of training under actual conditions of sea and weather and with the assurance that such manoeuvres are in accordance with the best practice , so far as can be decided in time of peace. - He replied : ' ' - lie answered " no " also to this question : " is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through actual experiment as the best that can be devised ? " He gave the same answer to the question as to whether the navy had any plan for defense against torpedo attacks " other than the conventional methods in use a year ago , "
