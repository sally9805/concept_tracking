AFIB of colossal proportions , a lie so enormous that it flaunts and scorns belief , has amused Americans ever since there has been any such thing as a national temperament this side the water . If the assertion be made in sedate and solemn fashion , so much the funnier . Analyzing humor is like dissecting a butterfly ; but it is safe to say this much , ? that exaggeration has been a chief ingredient of all American humor , and has always distinguished it from European products . British audiences gazed in amazement at a hesitating young American lecturer who asserted shyly and gravely that Brigham Young had one hundred and eighty wives , and that it took him three days to kiss them all . They listened until amazement had given place to merriment ? and Artemus Ward had won a triumph . The first American humorous writers appeared not many years ago . We do not find a school of American literature of any kind in the early years of the republic ; and as the men of those days had little time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building to be done , it would seem as though the early writers had less time for laughter . In the years just before the Civil War we began , as a people , to find a little more time for the study of ourselves . We had developed a national sensitiveness toward outside criticism , and a personal pride as Americans . At the same time Providence sent us our first humorous writers as a safeguard against too great self-satisfaction .  | These men found plenty of material ready to hand . The country was raw and undeveloped , there was comparatively little traveling among the sections , and each corner of the land had its native type , with peculiarities that amused the provincial inhabitants of another section . Of the men who wrote at least a decade before the war , Augustus Baldwin Longstreet , George Horatio Derby , William Tappan Thompson , and others described the life of their rural neighbors in the South , while Seba Smith , Frederick Swartwout Cozzens in the " Sparrowgrass Papers , " Mrs. Frances Miriam Whitcher as the " Widow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the North to see themselves as others might see them , ? and laugh about it . EARLY " SLAPSTICK " HUMOR This early period of American humorous literature might with all due respect be called the day of the slapstick , as it was the day of blunt tools in so many directions of national activity . Politics was played with a club , caricature was brutal , oratory was flamboyant , and to the more sensitive taste of today the humor of that period lacked subtlety . Among the tricks of the humorous writer 's trade at that time ? the habit deserves no more dignified phrase ? was the use of grotesque spelling . Perhaps this was a half-conscious effort to create a crude national dialect , caricaturing a widespread slovenliness of speech . At any rate , it characterized the professionally humorous writers of the wartime . Bad spelling served as a sort of helpful announcement , as though the writer said , " What I now tell you is intended to be funny : do not read it seriously . " JOSH BILLINGS , THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that day stood " Josh Billings , " born Henry Wheeler Shaw . Test almost any of his epigrams by translation into pure English and correct spelling , and the fun is there . " There is no man so poor but what he can afford to keep one dog , and I have seen them so poor that they could afford to keep three , " is a sentiment that does not gain its accuracy or any other quality from the spelling . " Truth is sed to be stranger than fickshun : it is to most pholks , " is a characteristic bit of his philosophy . Henry Wheeler Shaw was born at Lanesborough , Massachusetts , in 1818 ; he died at Monterey , California , in 1885 . The life of remarkable variety that crowded those years is worthy of notice , because it parallels the lives of so many of our other humorists . If there were space in this article to analyze closely our distinctive American humor , ? to go behind the returns , in other words , ? we should find utmost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ward and Lanigan and Stockton and wain and a score of others were rolling stones in their business affairs , or Jacks of all trades , rubbing elbows at one time or another with men of every rank and variety . Shaw entered Hamilton College ; but left before graduation to take up a roving life in the West . He was successively farmer , steamboat captain , and real estate agent . In 188 he returned to New York and became an auctioneer in Poughkeepsie , at the same time beginning to write for newspapers and magazines . For ten years he published annually  | his " Farmer 's Allminax , " a delightful travesty upon the serious almanacs then current ; but filled with shrewd wisdom that reminds one of that firs : great American gazetteer , " Poor Richard . " " Josh Billings , His Sayings . " and " Every boddy 's Friend " were among his most widely popular books . In discussing our early humorists there is little space here for these who obviously gained inspiration from British models . Benjamin Perhallow Shillaber was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The former 's " Mrs. Partington , " an American Mrs. Malaprop , is good reading today ; and the latter owes to Thomas Hood a muse that still excites our laughter . Nor should we do more than mention in passing Washington Irving and Lowell and Holmes , or any of the founders of our literature . They are among our greatest humorists ; but their names belong elsewhere . We like to think that humor was an inevitable part of their greatness because they were Americans . ARTEMUS WARD , THE ORIGINAL The man who perhaps first drew Old World attention to a New World school of humor was Charles Farrar Browne , universally known as " Artemus Ward . " Born later than Josh Billings , at Waterford , Maine , in 1834 , and dying when yet a young man , in Southampton , England , in 1867 , his fame was more widely heralded than that of Shaw . He too roamed from one end of the land to the other , as a journeyman printer . He too rejoiced in a wonderful " fonetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to depend upon their humor as a source of livelihood , took to the lecture platform . The presentday reader may wonder that Artemus Ward should ever have gained the wider vogue . But his charm of personality and the fact that he gave first place to his lectures , afterward publishing them in book form , may account for this in great measure . It is said that all who saw and heard him delighted in him ; and this was specially true of the British public , which seemed stunned at first by the utter extravagance of his humor , then flocked to his lectures in delighted crowds . His letters to " Punch " ( the first American contributions , by the way , to that august journal ) were enjoyed throughout England . Once taken to the British bosom , he might jibe at the Tower , and joke in Stratford-onAvon , and his very daring added to his success . Writing to " Punch " about his visit to the Tower of London , he says , " A Warder now took us in charge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and things . The Trater 's Gate is wide enuff to admit about twenty traters abrest , I should jedge ; but beyond this , I could n't see that it was superior to gates in ginral . Traters , I will here remark , are a onfortnit class of people . If they was n't , they would n't be traters . They conspire to bust up a coun- try , ? they fail , and they 're traters . They bust her , and they become statesmen and heroes . " Mr. Browne took delight in referring to himself as a showman . Next to his famous lecture on his visit to the Mormons , his descriptions of the animals in his traveling show won greatest popular success . It is easy to group many of the writings of our nineteenth century humorists in the slapstick school , while at the same time one may hesitate to apply the term to the individuals who produced it . Almost without exception each one of them wandered in and out of other fields , or often in his most boisterous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Locke , writing under the name of " Petroleum V. Nasby , " not only delighted President Lincoln and brought him needed relaxation of mind , but was of great assistance to the Northern cause . Robert Henry Newell , as " Orpheus C. Kerr , " wrote in the same vein ; while Charles Henry Smith , as " Bill Arp , " similarly served the Confederacy . These , and many others whose names deserve equal mention , we find hard to read at length today , with their weird spelling , their vociferous humor , and often with a vein of coarseness that was characteristic of the period rather than of the individual . BILL NYE AND NEWSPAPER HUMORISTS One writer in particular , Bill Nye , deserves special mention here because he carried that earlier school of humor over into the present day ; his hilarious wit and his delightful exaggeration have grouped him with Ward and Billings and Nasby , while he belongs in point of time with that later group of men developed by the newspapers , such as James Montgomery Bailey ( " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | the " Burlington Hawkeye , " Charles Bertram Lewis ( " M. Quad " ) of the " Detroit Free Press , " Charles Heber Clark ( " Max Adeler " ) , and several others . Edgar W. Nye was born at Shirley , Maine , in 185o , and died near Asheville , North Carolina , in 1896 . He too rubbed elbows with men of every section in his variety of occupations , and in company with James Whitcomb Riley faced large audiences from the lecture platform . His Published works were many , some so recent that the test of time lends tittle aid to our judgment . " Bill Nye and the Boomerang , " " A Comic History of the United States , " and " The Railroad Guide " are still fresh in the memories of many readers . At his best he fully equals Josh Billings ; but he lacks that underlying philosophy that has led critics to liken the latter to La Rochefoucauld . " You can stimulate your hair , " says Nye , by using castor oil three ounces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sewing machine , and absorb the brandy between meals . The brandy will no doubt fly right to your head , and either greatly assist your hair or it will reconcile you to your lot . If you wish , you may drink the brandy and then breathe hard on the scalp . This will be difficult at first ; but after while it will not seem irksome . "  | Perhaps as an epigrammist Bill Nye will be best remembered . His remark that he had become convinced that Wagner 's music " is not half as bad as it sounds " touched a sympathetic chord in the hearts of many ; and there is pleasant philosophy in his assertion , " As far as I am concerned , individually , I could worry along someway if we did n't have a phenomenon in the house from one year 's end to another . " There is a quieter school of writers who have not only made us laugh , but have done a service to literature in preserving the dialect and manners and customs of out-of-the-way corners . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of James Whitcomb Riley , and George W. Cable , and a hundred of greater or less fame . THE AUTHOR OF " UNCLE REMUS " One among them , Joel Chandler Harris , stands out as an American humorist who has performed a lasting service to literature and to the science of folklore by reason of his Uncle Remus stories . Joel Chandler Harris was born at Eatonton , Georgia , in 1848 , and died at Atlanta in 1908 . Like many others whose names have found place here , he was a printer by trade . Later he became a journalist , and finally editor of the " Atlanta Constitution . " In 188o he published a book entitled " Uncle Remus : His Songs and His Sayings , " intending it to be a serious contribution to Afro-American folk lore . He awoke next morning , as the saving is , to find himself hailed as a humorous author , with an audience worldwide . Today those stories , and the many others that followed , have a permanent place in literature . " Nights with Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " Daddy Jake , the Runaway , " appeal to children and their elders , not because they are an accurate portrayal of the true Southern darky , but because of the unadulterated enjoyment they afford . FRANK R. STOCKTON 'S WIDE RANGE A wider field of amusing human nature was exploited by Frank R. Stockton , who might properly have been mentioned with Bret Harte and others who have contributed so largely to literature outside the realm of humor . And yet his fantastic fairy stories for children and his inimitable  | " Rudder Grange " compel a notice in this article . His humor was quiet rather than extravagant , but the characters he introduces , and the fantasy of plot in his stories , mark him as distinctively American . He was born in Philadelphia in 1834 , and died in 1902 . He began life as an engraver ; but later devoted himself to journalism . American children who read the " St. Nicholas " magazine felt a love for him that seemed somehow to attach itself to his , personality , as though they saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " The Bee-Alan of Orn , " and other stories that they awaited so eagerly . MARK TWAIN , PRINCE OF HUMORISTS A study of our American humor carries one over but a short period of years when all is said . And it seems as though a glance at each phase of American humor helps us to consider the writings of that prince of them all , Mark Twain , and appreciate the wide range of his humor and the depth of his philosophy . He was born at Florida , Missouri , in 1835 , and his boyhood , spent in the neighboring town of Hannibal , acquainted him with the varied types of humanity that throve along the Mississippi River in the " flush times " of steamboating . Samuel Langhorne Clemens he was baptized ; but the pen name that he later selected from the terminology of steamboat piloting supersedes any other in the minds and hearts of the reading world . Mark Twain too learned the trade of printer ; afterward he achieved his boyhood ambition and became a river pilot ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled down to the serious business of writing , compares in length to that of Josh Billings and Artemus Ward . He was prospector and newspaper editor in the gold fields of Nevada ; was reporter in San Francisco , soldier for a short time in the war , and lecturer throughout the United States . He too rubbed elbows with every type of fellow citizen , and his shrewd and searching humor made " copy " of them all . Just as his life in those early days paralleled closely the lives of some of the wartime humorists , so did his first writings partake of their boisterous style , their untrammeled exaggeration , and often their coarseness . But his genius broadened with his years , and as his knowledge of human nature increased he developed a searching insight and a kindly philosophy that make it impossible to associate his name with any single group . When the present generation has forgotten the laughter that he evoked , it is hard to say which of his writings will determine the place he will occupy . Perhaps those stories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , " with wide appeal to youth and age , will be the determining factors ; or " The Info- cents Abroad , " " A Tramp Abroad , " and others of his farcical writings , despite their wealth of fact or philosophy , will leave him distinctively among the humorists . Perhaps " The Prince and the Pauper " and " The Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc " will find another niche for his fame . We of today ? for he was so lately among us ? honor him for all and leave the question of relative merit in his works to be settled at another time . Hardly another American writer of any day won , during his lifetime , such worldwide recognition . American universities , and Oxford as well , delighted to honor him with degrees , and his nds were myriad . It is not wise , in such a study as this , to consider the work of men now living , who are still in the fullness of their powers . George Ade and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bangs , Oliver Herford , Gelett Burgess , Ellis Parker Butler , Wallace Irwin , and a score of other presentdav humorists are contributing something to American literature that will place their names finally in some other category . We mention them and their group at this time merely as a tribute of gratitude to them all for keeping the flame of American humor so brightly burning .  |
