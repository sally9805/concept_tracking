WHAT you need is a complete change , and quiet , ' said his cousin Dorothy . Guy , indeed , in spite of his efforts to keep up appearances , was a dismal figure . He had been passing the tea-cups and the bread and butter , enduring all the jests about sugar-rations and margarine , and enduring , which was so much worse , the complacencies over the approaching end of the war . His haggard face , narrow-jawed and high-foreheaded , expressed this endurance rather than any social amenity , and he was aware that Aunt Emily could hardly feel that the presence of her poet and soldier nephew added much to her tea-party . Indeed , the chattering , cheerful women affected his nerves almost as painfully as did the sound of the motorbuses when ? every day it happened ? he stopped on the curb , after leaving his office in Whitehall , and wondered how long it would take him to summon courage to cross the street . He felt , then , like breaking down and crying ; and he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all too splendid ! ' Cousin Dorothy was as chattering and as cheerful as the rest of them , and she had every reason to be , he remembered , with Tom , her fiance , ensconced in Paris , safe after all his perils . DoroVOL. 124 - NO. 2 A thy , though like everybody else she had worked hard during the war , had seen nothing and lost nothing . And she had never had any imagination . All the same , he was thankful when she rescued him from the woman who would talk to him idiotically about his poetry ( she evidently had n't understood a word of it ) , and took him into the quiet nook near the piano . It might , then , have been mere consanguinity , for he had never before found intimacy possible where Dorothy was concerned ; or it might have been a symptom of his state ( his being at Aunt Emily 's tea-party at all was that ! ) ; but , at all events , after admitting that Mrs. Dickson had been boring him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motor-buses , his terror of the dark , his sleeplessness and general disintegration . His nervous laugh was a concession to Dorothy 's possible misunderstanding ; but as he went on , he felt himself almost loving her for the matter-of-factness she infused into her sympathy . After all , even good old Dorothy was n't stupid enough to suspect him of cowardice ; and although , from a military point of view , he had made such a mess of it ( invalided home again and again on account of digestive complaints , and finally , last spring , transferred to his small official post in London ) , to anyone , really , who had at 146 AUTUMN all followed his career , it would be apparent that no one could have stuck harder to the loathly job . He had felt that , and only that , even:while , prompted by pride , he had made his effort to enlist , in the first months of the war . It had been with a deep relief that he had found himself at once rejected and free to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than with his inefficiency ; for he took his poetic vocation with a youthful seriousness . And when , later on , through one of the blunders of medical examination , he was drawn into the net of conscription , no one could have denied that ho had marched off to the shambles with unflinching readiness . Dorothy , he saw , took courage all along for granted . It 's simply a case of shell-shock , ' she said , as if it were her daily fare ; you 're queer and jumpy , and you ca n't stand noise . It 's quite like Tommy . ' He could n't associate Tommy , short-nosed , round-headed , red-cared Tommy , with anything of the sort , and said so in some resentment . But Dorothy assured him that for some months ? just a year ago ? Tommy had been at home on sick leave , and really bad enough for anything . ' He suffered in every way just as you do . ' Guy was quite sure he had n't , but he did not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would he have defined to Dorothy what he really suffered . It 's country air you need ; country food and country quiet , ' Dorothy.went on . ' You can get away ? ' ' Oh , yes ; I can get away all right . Old Forsyth is most decent about it . He was telling me this morning that I ought to take a month . ' ' I wonder if Mrs. Baldwin could have you at Thatches , ' Dorothy mused . ' Tommy got well there directly . ' ' Mrs. Baldwin ? ' His voice , he knew , CROCUSES expressed an unflattering skepticism , but he could n't help it . ' Is she a home ? an institution ? ' He saw Mrs. Baldwin , hatefully tactful , in a Red Cross uniform . No , thank you , my dear . ' ' Of course not . What do you take me for ? ' Dorothy kept her competent eyes upon him . ' It ' s not even a P.G . place  --  at all events , not a regular one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She has very narrow means and takes friends sometimes , and , since the war , it 's just happened ? by people telling each other , as I 'm telling you. - to be shell-shock cases rather particularly . It 's a lovely country and a dear , quaint little cottage , and she does you most awfully well , Tommy said . ' ' I do n't like the idea of settling down like that on a stranger . ' But she would n't be a stranger . You 'd go through me , and I feel as if I knew her already through Tommy . He said he was at home at once . " Cosy , " was how he expressed it . And you get honey on your bread at tea and cream in your coffee at breakfast , and all sorts of delightful things en casserole , that she cooks with her own hands , quite equal , Tommy said , to the French . And Tommy knows , now , you see . ' It 's Mrs. Baldwin herself who frightens me . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That ' s just what she wo n't do . She 's perfectly sweet . Cosy . Middle-aged . A widow . Her nice old father lives with her , and Tommy liked him so much , too . You help her to garden , and with the bees , you know . And the old father plays chess with you in the evenings . There 's a stream near by where you can fish if you want to . It ' s late for that , of course ; but Tommy got some quite good sport ; he was there at just this time of year . And he said that it was most awfully jolly country , and that the meadows all about were full of autumn crocuses . ' Autumn crocuses ? In the fields ? I 've never seen them wild . ' They do grow wild , though , in some parts of England . They are wild there . Tommy particularly wrote about them . He said one walked down to the stream among the autumn crocuses . ' Dorothy was baiting her hook very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' They do sound attractive , ' he owned . He had n't imagined Tom a man to notice crocuses , and he was the more inclined to trust his good impressions further . After all , apart from Mrs. Baldwin and her father , the country , with honey , cream , and autumn crocuses , was a happy combination , if he had been in a condition for feeling anything happy . What would Dorothy have thought of him , could she have known that , while they talked , her rosy , bonnie face kept constantly , before his haunted eyes , dissolving into a skull ? Faces had a way of doing this with him since his last encounter with the war in the spring . And all the talking people in the room squeaked and gibbered .. How could they go on talking ? How could they go on living ? after what had happened ? How could he ? The familiar nausea rose in him even as he forced himself to smile and to say , Well , could she have me ? Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find a place for himself . Such efforts , he felt sure , would have landed him at some God-forsaken farmhouse miles from the station , where the beds were damp and the meat tough ; or , even worse , at a Bournemouth hotel , amid orchestras and people who made a point of dressing for dinner . But , if someone found it for him , he would let himself be pushed off . I 'm sure she could , ' said Dorothy with conviction . ' I have her address and I 'll write to-night and tell her all about you : that you ' re a rising poet , and that your friends and relations will be so grateful if she ' 11 do for you what she did for Tommy . ' He had an ironic glance for her ' rising . ' His relations ? and Aunt Emily and her brood were the nearest left to him ? had never in the least taken in his standing or realized that he was , among people who knew , looked upon as completely risen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself ; drowned deep ; too deep , he sometimes thought , for recovery . His last little volume had been like a final fight for breath . He had written most of it over there , after Ronnie 's death and before his own decisive breakdown , and he knew it a result as much of his malady as of his war-experience . He wondered now , anew , whether these people had really read the poems . If they had , it only showed how impervious to reality they must remain . And there hail actually been one , written after one of his leaves , caked ' Eating Bread-and-Butter , ' that should indeed have embarrassed them , had they remembered it , inviting them to eat it with him in a trench with unburied comrades lying in No-Man 's Land before them . His head , as he thought of that , ? from unburied comrades passing to unburied friends , ? gave a nervous backward jerk , for he had told himself before that he must stop thinking in certain directions ; and indeed the poems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had been written . All tire same , it was very strange ? such a poet at such a tea-party . He had plunged into Aunt Emily 's tea-party as Ire plunged nowadays into anything that presented itself as offering distraction . And now , as he said , ' Well , if you 'll put it through , go , and be very grateful to you , ' he felt that he was making another plunge into Mrs. Baldwin 's cottage . deleted material adjuncts , she proved that she knew how to make one comfortable . There were the meadows and ? Going again to the window , he wondered , leaning out , could he see the autumn crocuses . Yes , surely ; even at this evening hour his eyes distinguished the pale yet delicately purpling tint that streaked the pastoral verdure . What a delicious place , indeed ! He stood , absorbed in looking out , until the maid came to say that supper would be ready in five minutes . The long room , the living-room , ? for it combined , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meadows at the back of the house , and the primrose colored sunset still filled it as he entered . Mrs. Baldwin was busying herself with the table , and an old gentleman with a very long white beard rose , with much dignity , from the grandfather 's chair near a window-seat . Mr. Haseltine , so his daughter named him , had more the air of seeing the visitor as a P.G. , perhaps even as a shell-shock patient ; but he was a nice old man , Guy felt , although his heard was too long . He wore a brown velveteen jacket , and Guy surmised that he might have been a writer or scholar of some not very significant sort . Yes , we think ours a very favored nook indeed , ' he said , as Guy again praised the prospect . Yes ; three cottages . Very happily contrived , is it not ? There is a clever builder in the next town . He kept the old fireplace , you see ; that end was a kitchen and the beams are all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ; but that is entirely my daughter 's creation . Pig-styes used to be in that corner . ' Guy looked out at the squares of color , the low beds of mignonette , the phloxes , larkspurs , and late sweet-peas , a screen of stained-glass tints against the sky . Where the pig-styes had been was a little thatched summer-house , // with rustic seat and table . The beehives were just outside the hedge , at an angle of the meadow . Mr. Haseltine continued to talk while Mrs. Baldwin and the maid came in and out carrying tea and eggs and covered dishes . ' I hope you do n't mind high tea , ' she said . ' It seems to go with our life here . ' He felt that high tea was his favorite meal . There was a big white earthenware bowl on the table , filled with sweet-peas . ' Where do you get the old-fashioned colors ? ' he asked her . ' I thought the growers had extirpated them ; one sees only the long-stemmed ones nowadays , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he felt sure , and she told him that she always saved the seed , liking the old , bright colors better , too . He was glad that he had come , although Mr. Haseltine 's beard was too long and he feared that he would prove talkative in the worst way , the deliberate and retaining way . He liked the smell of everything , ? a mingling of sweet-peas , rush-matting , and China tea , ? and the look of everything ; good , unpretentious old oak furniture , fresh , if faded , chintzes , and book-lined walls ; and he presently liked the taste of everything , too . I feel already as if I should sleep to-night , ' he said to Mrs. Baldwin . She sat behind the tea-urn , a little distracted , if anything so mild could be called distraction , by the plunging movements of the little maid as she moved about the table . That will do nicely , Cathy , ' she said . We can managd now . You can bring in some more hot water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll sleep . People usually sleep here . ' She was hardly middle-aged , though , after Dorothy 's bright browns and pinks , Tommy might well have thought her so . Many years older than Dorothy , of course , yet how many he could deleted material To-night , from the habit of it , his mind braced itself as he came into the room , and he was aware , as he had been for nearly a year now , that Ronnie 's face was waiting , as it were , on the outskirts of consciousness , to seize upon him . But , after he had lighted the candles on his dressing-table and the candles on the mantelpiece , taken off his coat , and started undressing , he found that his thoughts , quite effortlessly , were engaged with his new surroundings , old Mr. Hase'tine 's beard and eyeglasses occupying them , and the clucking noise he made in drinking the glass of hot ginger and water that had been brought to them on a tray while they played ; Mrs. Baldwin 's accounts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He decided that the color was Wedgwood , or perhaps periwinkle blue ? some very dense , quiet color . As he moved about the room , this protective interest came to him from the little objects he made acquaintance with : the round Venetian box , dim gilt and blue and red , on the chest of drawers , in which he found a handful of tiny shells ? shells , no doubt , that Mrs. Baldwin had picked up during a seaside outing ; the faded old blue leather blotter on the writing-table , marked E. H. , which had probably been hers since maiden days ( and did E stand for Ethel or Edith or Ellen ? ) ; the pretty lettering in fine black script of the writing-paper so pleasantly stacked ; the dear old Dutch coffee-pot and jug on the mantel , and the bowl of mignonette that she , of course , had arranged . He sank his face into its fragrance , and peace seemed breathed upon him from the flowers . He was wondering , as he got into bed , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the birds and branches , the whites and blacks and roses of the voile-de-Genes , whether he would find the autumn crocuses open in the meadows next morning ; it had looked likethe evening of another fine day . Then , the candle out , his thoughts , for a little while , were tangled in the magical dreamland of the voile-de-Genes , and the breath of the mignonette seemed to lie upon his eyelids with a soft compulsion to peace , until , all thought sliding suddenly away , he dropped into delicious slumber . He found the crocuses open , before breakfast . Only Cathy was in the living-room , sweeping , when he crossed it , though he thought he heard Mrs. Baldwin in the kitchen . A robin was singing on a spray aver the summer-rouse . The sky arched pale and high ; and though there was no mist in the air , its softness made him think of milk . From the garden he passed into the meadows , and , almost at once , saw , everywhere , the fragile , purple flowers about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their clear , cold tint . Lower down , near the stream , they made him think of the silver bobbins set playing by great rain-drops when they fall heavily upon wide , shallow pools of water ; and they seemed to grow even more thickly in the farther meadow beyond the wooden bridge . A sense of bliss was upon him as he walked among the flowers . He had never seen anything more lovely , and all but the darker buds were open , allowing pale golden hearts to the sun . Yet , by the time that he had crossed the bridge , leaning on the high rail to look down into the limpid , sliding water , he knew that it could never stay at that or mean that for him . He had seen fields of flowers in France , and , while the horrors there had been enacted , these fields of crocuses , year after year , had bloomed . What they meant for his mind was the unbridged chasm between nature and the sufferings of man . Only when one ceased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could such a day , such sights , bring the unreasoning joy . Walking back , he saw , as he approached the house , that Mrs. Baldwin was standing at the garden-gate , and , bare-headed , in the linen dress of pale lavender , she made him at once think of the crocuses , or they of her . Their gentleness was like her , their simplicity , and something , too , ? for he felt this in her , ? of unearthliness . More , perhaps , than any other flower they seemed to belong to the air rather than to the ground , and , with their faint , pale stalks , their fragile petals unconfined by leaf or calyx , to be rising like emanat ions from the sod and ready to dissolve in mist into the sunlight . ' You 've had a little walk ? ' Mrs. Baldwin asked hint as they met . He said he had been looking at the crocuses . ' Arc they really crocuses ? ' he questioned . ' I 've never seen them wild before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , ' though those grow wild , too , in a few places in England . These flowers are always called autumn crocuses hereabouts ; but they are really , botanically , meadow saffron ; and they grow wild in a great many places . You see they are not so dark a purple as the wild crocus , and they are much taller , and the petals are more pointed . Much more beautiful flowers , I think . ' ' Meadow saffron . That 's a pretty name , too . But I think I 'll go on calling them autumn crocuses . They were one of the reasons that made me want to come here , ' he told her . They were leaning on the little gar-den gate looking over the meadows . ' Really ? Did you hear about them ? ' He told her what Dorothy had said , passed on from the appreciative Tom-my , and she said again , ' Really ! ' and with surprise , so that , laughing a little , he said that he believed shewould never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crocuses . She laughed a little , too , confessing to a community of perception where Tommy was concerned , and remarking that it was very nice of him to have cared . ' What he talked about , ' she said , ' was the food . He was never done praising my coffee . It 's time for coffee now , ' she added . Guy , as they went in , said that , after all , if that was what Tommy had talked about , he wondered that his caring for the crocuses should have surprised her , for he was sure that the one was almost as poetical as the others . It was poetical , indeed , as she made it , in a delightful and complicated apparatus , glass and brass and premonitory scented steam ; and the milk was as hot as the water had been , and there was cream . ' How do you manage it , in these days ? ' he asked . But she said that it was n't wickedness and bribery , really : she and Cathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearest farm . He realized that he was himself talking about the food just as Tommy had done ; just as the chattering women at Aunt Emily 's tea-party had done ; just as everybody , of course , had been doing in England ever since food became such an important matter . But it was Mrs. Baldwin who made him do it ; for though unearthly , she was deliciously prosaic . He felt that anew when he heard her going about the house in her low-heeled little shoes , with Cathy . They did , evidently , all the work , and how fresh , composed , and shining everything was . The living-room , with its happy southern windows , its tempting writing-tables , its flowers and books , was an embodiment of the poetry that only such prose can secure . Guy , while Mr. Haseltine sat behind his rustling Times , strolled before the shelves , surprised , presently , at their range of subject . Surely not Mrs. Baldwin 's , such reading ; hardly , he thought , Mr. Haseltine 's . He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly-leaf , ' Oliver Baldwin , ' written in a small , scholarly hand . That explained it , then . Her husband 's . The Charles d'Orlea.ns , too , the Fustel de Coulanges , the Croce , and the Dante , with marginal notes . He had been a man of letters , perhaps . Of the dozen books he took down to examine , only one was initialled ' E. H. , ' and that , suitably , was Dominique . But it had been given to her by ' 0 . B. ' As in the garden , presently , he and the old gentleman walked up and down , smoking , Guy asked him , with the diffidence natural to the question , whether his son-in-law , Mrs. Baldwin 's husband , had been killed in the war ; though he could n't imagine her a war .. widow . One did n't indeed think of her in connection with marrying and giving in marriage ? that was part of the unearthliness ; yet widowhood , permanent widowhood , seemed a suitable state . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widowed , and it had happened , he felt sure , in spite of his question , long ago . As he had expected , his companion replied , Ah , no ; he died eight , nine years since . ' And Mr. Haseltine then went on to tell , taking the war as the obvious interest , and not without the satisfaction that Guy had so often met and so often loathed , that he had lost dear ones . ' Children of my eldest son . Fine lads . Brave boys . One in the first mouth ? at the Marne ; the other only last year , flying . Yes ; I 've done my bit , ' said Mr. Haseltine , with the fatuity that lie was so plentifully companioned in displaying . Bit . ' Odious word . His ' bit . ' Why his ? Had anyone written a poem on the formula coming from the lips of those for whom others had died ? A scattered , flagellating line or two floated through Guy 's mind . Something abOnt barbedwire came in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bit , ' hung upon that and unable to die . He wondered where the fine lads now lay . No more coffee for them , with cream in it ; no more robins singing ; no more strolling smokes among mignon .. ette in the sunlight . How they were forgotten , already , except as self-glorifying trophies ! How pleased , how smug this rescued , comfortable world ! Something of his distaste attached itself even to Mrs. Baldwin when she next appeared . Something irritated him in her peacefulness . She , too , had seen nothing and lost nothing . But , at all events , she would n't , he knew that , take any stand on the two nephews to claim her ' bit . ' There was nothing fatuous about Mrs. Baldwin . The slight distaste still lingered , however , and he found himself wondering once or twice , during the day that passed , in spite of it , so pleasantly , whether she was n't , for all his idealizing similes , a stupid as well as a sweet woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let her father do all the talking at meals : it was simply because she had nothing to say , and the good old boy was quite right in taking his responsibility for granted . The person who could talk was the responsible person . Her mind , thoughso occupied , : was quite singularly inactive and , he was sure , completely uncritical . She did n't find her father in the least a bore , or suspect that anybody else might find him so . She did find , Guy felt sure , satisfaction in all her occupations . He heard her laughing ? a very quiet little laugh ? with Cathy in the kitchen ; and in the afternoon , when he helped her to pick out seedlings , her attentive profile ? as , after he had dug each hole , she dropped in the little plant , pressed the earth about its roots , and fixed it in its place ? made him think of the profile of a child putting its dolls to bed . They 154 AUTUMN planted three beautiful long rows , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had high tea at half-past six , they were not deprived of the precious afternoon pause , taking place as it did at the unaccustomed but pleasing hour of four . After tea she went to see some people in the village , Mr. Haseltine dozed in his chair , and Guy took a long walk . So the days went on , and at the end of a week he was able to write to Dorothy and tell her that he was sleeping wonderfully and that Mrs. Baldwin 's cottage was all that she had pictured it . By the end of the week he had even grown rather attached to Mr. Haseltine , and he enjoyed playing chess with him every evening ; and sometimes they had a game in the afternoon when tea was over . The undercurrent of irritation still flowed , but he had learned to put up with the old gentleman and to circumvent his communicativeness , and in the case of Mrs. Baldwin he more and more felt that she was the sort of person to whom one would , probably , forgive anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dullness might also be unawareness . That was a tain kind of dullness , it was true , but it did n't preclude capacity for response if the proper stimulus were applied . It amused him to note that if none of the nearly inevitable jars of shared life seemed ever to occur between her and her father , it was simply because , when a difference arose , she remained unconscious of it unless it were put before her . Nothing could have been less in the line of selfishness ; it was she who thought of him , of his comfort and happiness , and who ordered her life to further them ; he , in this respect , was passive ; but Guy felt that the poor old boy often brooded in some disconsolateness over small trials and perplexities that a companion more alert to symptoms would have discerned and dispelled at once . Mr. CROCUSES Haseltine even , sometimes , confided such grievances to the P.G . do n't want to bother Effie about it , ' he said ; ? E. had stood for Effie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it 's quite evident to me that the rector and his wife have been expecting to be asked to tea to meet you . I 've just been talking to them in the lane , and I saw it plainly . Theyltad asked us to bring you before you arrived , hearing we were to have another guest , ? they 've always been most kind and neighborly in helping us to entertain our new friends , ? and I really do n't know why Effie should have got out of it . I usually have to remind her , it 's true . But I sometimes get tired of always having to . She does n't care for them herself ; but that 's no reason why you might not . We have few enough interests to offer visitors . ' Guy was glad to have escaped the rectory tea , though he did not say this in assuring Mr. Haseltine that the entertainment offered at Thatches was absolutely to his taste . He was completely out of place at any rectory ; he could imagine no rector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt that there was justice in Mr.Haseltine 's contention . He might have cared for them . As it was , Mr. Haseltine was brought once again to reminding her . It was evident then that she was ready to please anybody or everybody . Ask them ? Ought I to ask them ? ' ' My dear , it 's ten days since they sent their invitation . They spoke again ? and it 's the second time ? of having been so sorry not to see us , when I met them yesterday , in the lane . I do n't know why you did not go . ' ' I thought it would bore Mr. Norris , father . He came here for quiet , you know : But would it bore you ? ' she asked Guy . ' They are very nice . I do n't mean that . ' It 's certainly very pleasant being quiet , ' said Guy ; but if Mr. Haseltine likes having them , I assure you that people do n't frighten me in the least . ' ' Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' I see our good friends continually . It is of them I am thinking , as well as of Mr. Norris . He might find them more interesting than you do , Effie , and they will , I fear , be hurt . ' Now that it was put before her , Mrs. Baldwin did it every justice , rising from the breakfast-table , where she had just finished , to go to her desk , and murmuring as she went , ' I had n't thought of that . They might be hurt . So , if it wo n't bore you , Mr. Norris . ' And the Laycocks were asked , and did indeed bore Guy sadly . It was on the night after their visit ? Mr. Laycock had questioned him earnestly about his personal impressions of the war and to evade him had been wearying ? that Guy , for the first time , really , since he had come , found sleep difficult and even menaced . It was because of that , he felt sure , looking back on it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? curious , and , had it taken place in the presence of anyone else , embarrassing . But what made it most curious was just that ; he had not felt it embarrassing to break down and sob before Mrs. Baldwin . The morning had begun badly . The breakfast-table papers had been full of the approaching victory . Mr. Haseltine read out passages from the Times as he broke his toast and drank his coffee . He had reiterated the triumph of his long conviction , and Mrs. Baldwin had murmured assent . ' All 's well with the world , ' was the suffocating assurance that seemed to breathe from them both . ' All 's blue . ' Was hell forgotten like that ? What if the war were won ? Of course , it had to be won ? that was an unquestioned premise that had underlain his rebellions as well as Mr. Haseltine 's complacencies since the beginning . But what of it ? No victory could redeem what had been clone . He went out into the garden , to be away from Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book into the summer-house ; and it was here , a little later , that Mrs. Baldwin , seeing him as she passed , her garden-basket on her arm , paused to ask him , with her smile of the shy hostess , if he were all right . She did n't often ask him that , and he saw at once that his recent recalcitrancy to rejoicing had pierced even her vagueness . He knew that he still looked recalcitrant , and he was determined not to soften the overt opposition rising in him ; so he raised his eyes to her over his book and said that he was not , perhaps , feeling very fit this morning . Mrs. Baldwin hesitated at the entrance to the summer-house . She looked behind her at the garden and up at the roses clustering over the lintel under the thatch ; she even took out her scissors , in the uncertainty that , evidently , beset her , and snipped oil ' a dead rose , and she said presently , ' It was all that talk about the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask is to forget it . ' ' Oh , I do n't ask that at all , ' said Guy . ' I should scorn myself for forgetting it . ' She glanced in again at him , mildly . ' I want to forget what 's irrelevant , like victory , ' he said ; but not what is relevant , like irremediable wrong . ' Her awareness had not , of course , gone nearly as far as this . She kept her eyes on him , and he was glad to feel that he could probably shock her . ' You see , ' he found himself saying , ' I saw the wrong . I saw the war ? at the closest quarters . ' Yes ? oh , yes , ' Mrs. Baldwin murmured . For me , tragedy does n't cease to exist when it 's shoveled underground . If one does go down into hell , one does n't want to forget the fact ? though one may hope to forget the torments and horrors ; one wants , rather , to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that actuality . ' There was silence after this for a moment , and he imagined that she was very much at a loss . Her next words seemed indeed to express nothing so much as her failure to follow ? that and a silliness really rather adorable , had he been in a mood to find it anything but exasperating . ' But , still ? hell does n't exist , does it ? ' she offered him for his appeasement . Guy laughed . ' Does n't it ? When things like this war can happen ? How could it ever have existed but in men 's hearts ? It 's there that it smoulders and , when its moment comes , leaps out to blast the world . ' He could talk to her like this because she was too simple to suspect in him a poetical attitudinizing ; anyone else would of course suspect it . Guy was even aware that to anyone else it would be that . She looked kind and troubled and as much as ever at a loss . She did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she was evidently uncertain what to do , since it might seem heartless to go away and leave him to his black thoughts , yet intrudingly intimate to come and sit down beside him . Nothing could be less intimate than Mrs. Baldwin . It was he , of course , who was tasteless in talking to her in a vein appropriate only to intimacy . ' Do n't bother over me , ' he said , offering her the patent artifice of a smile . ' I 'm simply a bad case . You must n't let me trouble you . You must just turn your back on me when I 'm like this . ' It was not poetic attitudinizing now ; there was in his voice a quaver of grief and she responded to it at once . ' Oh , but I do n't like to do that . I do wish I could be of some help . I see you have n't slept , for you look so tired , as you did when you first came . And CROCUSES Mr. Laycock did bore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you about the war . ' For the first time he saw in the eyes fixed upon him pity , evident pity and solicitude . And before it he felt himself crumble suddenly . He saw all the reasons she had for pitying him , did she but know . He saw Ronnie 's face again ; he saw his own haunted nights and his own grief . He wanted her to see it . ' Oh ? one ca n't be guarded like that , ' he murmured ; ' I must try to get used to it . But ? I did n't sleep ; that 's true . I 'm so horribly afraid of not sleeping . You ca n't imagine what it is . I 've the most awful visions . ' And leaning his elbows on the table , he put his hands before his face and began to cry . She stood there ; he did not hear her move at first ; and then she entered and sat down on the seat beside him . But she said nothing and did not touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his disintegration , a swift passage of surmise : would she not draw his head upon her shoulder , like a mother , and comfort him ? But that would have broken him down heaven knew how much further . He cried frankly , articulating presently , ' It 's my nerves , you know ; they have all gone to pieces . I lost my friend ; my dearest friend . For months I did n't sleep . ' Mrs. Baldwin 's silence was not oppressive , or repressive , either . He heard her hands move slightly on the basket she held on her knees and the soft chafing in the folds of her linen bodice that her breathing made . It was an accepting stillness and it presently quieted him ; more than that , it enabled him at last to lift his head and look at her without feeling ashamed of himself . Oddly enough , he knew that he , perhaps , ought to be . He could have helped himself . There had been an element of willfulness in his breakdown ; he had wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this about him , he would not have felt ashamed . She was so curiously a person with whom one could not associate blames and judgments . She was an accepting person . She was n't looking at him , but out at the sweet , bright , autumnal little garden ; and as her eyes came to him , he felt them full of thought ; felt , for the first time , sure that , whatever she might be , she was not dull . He could not remember , looking back at the little scene , that she had said a single further word . He did not think that he had said anything further . He was helping her , a little while after , to prune the Aimee Vibert rose that had grown with great unruliness over the little tool-house near the kitchen door . ' It will really pull it down unless we cut out some of these great branches , ' she had said , as , equipped with stout gloves , they had worked away together , unfastening the tangled trails and stretching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aimee Vibert was drastically dealt with , and it was midday before they finished fastening the thinned and shortened shoots into place . She had said nothing further ; but he believed that , for the first time , her thought really included him . He had been put before her . She was different afterwards . He had become an individual to her , and had ceased to be merely the paying guest . IV The third week came . There was rain , rather sad September rain , for a day or two . They sat in the evenings before the wide fireplace where logs blazed . Mrs. Baldwin , at his suggestion , read aloud to them Fabre 's Souvenirs Entontologiques . She read French prettily , better than he did himself , and he was a little chagrined once or twice to find that she knew it better , priding himself on his French as he did . Hehad lived for a year in Paris , with Ronnie , before the war . The horrors of the grim , complicated under-world revealed by the French seer distressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , feeling the marvels rather than the horrors , perhaps . She laughed a little , rather callously , at the ladies who devoured their husbands , and seemed pleased by the odious forethought of the egg-laying mothers . She shared Fabre 's humorous dispassionateness , if not the fond partiality which , while it made him the more charming , did n't , Guy insisted , make his horrid wasps and beetles a bit more so . As usual , she vexed him a little , even while , more and more , he felt her intelligent ; perhaps she vexed him all the more for that . ' She 's so devilishly contented with the world , ' he said to himself sometimes , even while he smiled , remembering her laughter . Old Mr. Haseltine fell asleep one night while she read , and to be together there before the fire , the old man sleeping beside them , made them nearer than they had ever been before . Guy was aware of this nearness while he listened and while he watched her hand , short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short ) support the book , and her eyelashes dropping down the page or raised to a fresh one . When he went to his room that night , he stood still for a long time , his candle in his hand , listening to the soft beat of the rain against the window . He was hardly ever now afraid of being alone , or of the dark , and he stood there musing and listening , while he still seemed to see Mrs. Baldwin 's hand as it held the book , and her reading profile . Her life seemed to breathe upon him and he rested in it . He slept deliciously . ' Did you know that I write ? ' he asked her next day . He had wondered about this once or twice before . deleted material searing , scorching ; wicked , if one would ; but not sad . ' Oh ! ' he murmured ; and he wondered if the divided feeling she had from the first roused in him had been this hatred , not perhaps of her , but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me very much , ' she said , feeling , no doubt , that , whatever he was , he was not pleased . " they made me see , I mean , all the things you have been through . ' Sad things , you call them . You know , I rather feel as if I 'd heard you call hell sad . ' She looked up at him quickly , and it was now she who was taken aback and , as she had been the other day , at a loss . And , as on the other day , she found the same answer , though she offered it deprecatingly , feeling his displeasure . But hell does n't exist . ' ' Do n't you think anything horrible exists ? ' They turned at the end of the meadow . It seemed to him , although he felt as if he hated her , that they were suddenly intimate in their antagonism . He would force that antagonism , and its intimacy , upon her ? to its last implication . Horrible ? Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that was , he reflected grimly , to the good . ' But it would have to be irretrievable , would n't it , to be hell ? ' she urged . ' Do you suggest that it 's not irretrievable ? You own it 's horrible . Irretrievably horrible , I call it . And that 's what I call hell . Yet all that you could find to say of my poems is that they were sad . ' She hesitated , feeling her way , hearing in the recurrent word how it had rankled . ' I only meant sad , I think , because of you ; because you had suffered so much . ' ' You seem always to imply that one might not have suffered ! ' And thrusting aside her quickly murmured , ' Oh , no , no ! ' he went on : I ca n't understand your attitude of mind . Do you realize at all , I sometimes wonder , what it has all meant , this nightmare we are living in ? we , that is , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me to see boys , dead boys , buried stealthily , at night , under fire ? Boys so mangled , so disfigured ? you read that poem , " Half a Corpse " ? ? that their mothers would n't have known them ; featureless , dismembered boys , heaped one upon the other in the mud . Has your mind ever dwelt upon the community of corruption in which they lie , as their mothers ' minds must dwell ? I do not understand you . I do not understand how you can dare to call such things sad . ' His own wrath shook and yet sustained him , though he knew a fear lest he had gone too far ; but in her silence ? they had reached the other end of the meadow and turned again - in their walk ? he felt that there was no resentment . It was as if she realized that those who have returned from hell can not be asked to stop and pick their words with courtesy , and accepted his vehemence , if not his blame ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her bewilderment had settled into thought . Yes . I can imagine , ' she said . ' But no , I do n't think that my mind has dwelt on those things . If I were their mothers , I do n't think that my mind would dwell , as you say . Something would burn through . There are other kinds of suffering ? better kinds ; they help , I believe . And , for that kind , it is worse , but is it so much worse than in ordinary life ? That is what happens all the time when there is no war : dreadful changes in the dead ; and burials . They are not quite so near in a , churchyard , and theirgraves are named ; but do you think that makes it easier to bear ? ' He felt now as if it were insult she was offering him . ' You deny all tragedy to war , then ? It 's all to you on a level with an Elegy in a Country Churchyard with curfew and rector and primrose-wreaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice had a hoarser note , but , mingled with the sincerity of what , at last , he knew he was to tell her , the very centre of his sick heart , went a surface appreciation of what he had just said and of how curfew and rector and primrose-wreaths would go into a bitter poem one day , ? you read that poem of mine at the end of the book . " His Eyes " is about myself and my friend Ronnie Barlow , the artist ; you never heard of him , I know . He hung , with shattered legs , dying , just in front of us , on the barbed wire , for three days and nights . When he could speak , it was to beg to be shot . We tried to get to him , four , five times ; it was no good . There was barbed wire between , and the Germans spotted us every time . He died during the third night , and next morning I found him looking at me ? as he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproach . And so he went on looking until the rats came and he had no more eyes to look with . Will you tell me that that is no worse than the deaths died in the parishes of England ? Will you tell me that it 's the sort of death died by the cheery , mature gentlemen who ate their dinners and slept warm and dropped a tear ? while they did their " bit " in their government offices ? over the brave lads saving England ? ' He had taken refuge from Ronnie in hatred of those whom , in the poem , he called his murderers , and his voice was weighted with its fierce indictment . In the pause that followed he had time to wonder if she found him , at last , intolerable . She walked beside him , still looking down , and it might well have CROCUSES been in a chill withdrawal . He almost expected to hear her , in another moment , find the conventional phrase with which to leave him . But no , ? and in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ? she was not going to punish him with convention ; she was not going to leave him . And what she said at last was , ' I 'm so sorry ! Please believe that I 'm so very , very sorry ! Only ? why do you speak , and write , as though it were someone 's fault ? ' Ah , here then , at last , they had come to it , the barrier , on one side of which he stood with his hell and she on the other in her artificial paradise . ' I write it and speak it because it is the truth , ' he said . ' Millions of innocent creatures , of gifted , beautiful creatures , like my friend , have been slaughtered , tortured , driven mad , because of greasy , greedy wire-pullers in their leather chairs at home . ' ' In this war , too ? ' ' This war preeminently . ' ' You do n't feel that the crime was Germany 's ? ' ' Oh , of course ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it on Germany , by all means . We 'll sleep the sounder ! Certainly , I grant it to you freely ? Germany struck the match and lighted the fuse . ' ' And were n't we all responsible for the fuse ? you and I , I mean , as much as the people in the leather chairs ? ' There was no irony in her repetition . ' The people who fought , as much as the people who did n't fight ? Was n't the fuse simply our conception of our national safety ? of our national honor ? That is what I feel so sad about your poems , ? though I should never have wanted to explain it , ? that you are so wrong , so ungenerous , so vindictive . ' In all his life it had rarely been his lot to know such astonishment . Astonishment came first ; and then the deep , deep hurt that rose , wave a.ftet wave , within him . Was this , then , what she felt for him ? only this ? Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the world ? Should not that have made her reverent of him , and pitiful ? Should a man who had endured such griefs receive such blows ? Waves of color , too , flooded his face and tears rushed to his eyes . He thought , when he was able at last to gather thoughts together , that it should now be for him to find the conventional phrase and leave her . But , glancing again at her profile , fmding it , though singularly pale , so much more gentle than severe , the impulse dropped . He was not strong enough for convention . He was shaken , shattered ; too weak even for self-preservation . He walked , miserable , and his mind full of a whirling darkness , beside her , determining only that she should be the first to speak again . She was . She had quite come out of her shyness , ? if it had ever been that , ? and though it was with something faltering , something that was , he made out , sorry for them both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not she , had brought them , it was more than all with resolution that she said , ' I am so sorry if I seem presumptuous . But you asked me . And your poems are n't the first I 've read . So many young men , who have been so brave , like you , and who have been through it all so that they have the right to speak , seem to feel more than anything that hatred , not against war , ? we all hate war , ? but against people , some groups of people , they make responsible . There are bad and selfish people everywhere , ? among poets , I feel sure , just as much as among statesmen ; but has n't this war proved ? since everybody has gone ? that no one group is bad and selfish ; that there are men in every group who have been glad to the for their country ? VOL. fay - NO . I know I have no weight with young men like you ; I am not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish that I could make you believe that you ought not to write like that ? with hatred in your heart . Can great poetry be written out of hatred ? And it 's not only yourself it hurts : it hurts other people ; harms them , I mean . It spreads a mood of darkness and fever just when they are so in need of light and calm . And for the mothers , for people who have lost , cruelly , those whom they loved as much , perhaps even more , than you loved your friend ? do you not see how your poems must sicken them ? Do you not see that it all becomes just that ? a community of corruption ? You imprison them , force them back into their helpless suffering ; when what they pray for is strength to rise above it and to feel all the goodness and love that has been given for them ; to feel what is beautiful , not what is horrible ; so as to be worthy of their dead . ' As he listened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nature , as if , against his very will and mind , she moved his heart to breaking with something passionate that spoke in her words , ? an overwhelming experience befell him . The crocuses beneath their feet , her sunlit shape beside him , her voice , as she spoke to him thus , with her very soul , blended together in a rising wave of light , or music , piercing , sweeping him , lifting him up to some new capacity , leaving the old inert and dangling , lifting and still lifting him , until at last , as if with a great , emerging breath , he came into a region bright and fair , whence , looking down on the dark and tattered past , he saw all life differently , even Ronnie 's death , even Ronnie 's eyes . Ronnie was with him , with Mrs. Baldwin , in the bright stillness . lIpborne , sustained , like a swimmer in some strange , new element , he seemed to gaze clown through its golden spaces at the inert , alien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he seemed to hear himself say . Yet all was not left behind , all was not rubbish ; else how could he be here , with her , with Ronnie ? It was bliss to see himself as he had been , since something else was so immeasurably secure . Oh ? could one stay always like this ! This was to taste of everlasting life . His longing , as if with a cry , a grasp from the swimmer , marked the soft turning of the tide . He sank , but it was sweetly , if with a strange , an infinite sadness , a sadness recorded , accepted , while he sank , as making forever the portion of the temporal consciousness . And the bliss still stayed in the acceptance , and purple ripples seemed to glide back rhythmically as the crocuses swam before his eyes . It had all been only an instant then , for her last words came to him as if she had but spoken them and he heard his own voice murmuring , as if from very far away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed themselves . He looked down at the crocuses and saw Mrs. Baldwin 's white shoes standing still among them . Lifting his eyes , which felt heavy , he found her looking at him with attention , with anxiety . It 's nothing , ' he tried to smile . ' Nothing at all . I mean ? you 've done me good . ' He saw that she had n't an idea of how she had done it . Do take my arm , ' she said . ' I ought to have remembered that you are not strong yet . ' He took her arm . Perhaps he needed it . His normal consciousness was gathering about him once again , but no longer with the old close texture . It was all more permeable to light ? that was how he tried to put it . And he heard his voice go on , ' You see ? what it all amounts to ? oh , I 'm not think-ing about the poems , I know that you must be right ? it 's not what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more right than what you say . something I love you . That 's why you can do it to me . I wonder I did n't see it before . You made me angry with your peacefulness . I did n't understand . I needed your peace . You , you were what I needed . You will forgive my speaking ? Surely you 'll understand . Perhaps you feel you hardly know me , while you are like my life . Is it possible that some day you might love me back and marry me ? ' He had used the words that came . They were the words of the normal consciousness . How else could he ask her to keep him always near her so that he might never lose that sense of paradise ? But she had stopped still and had drawn her arm from Isis . Was it possible that after what she had done to him , for him , she could see him only thus ? ' Oh , no , ' she said . No . No . ' Never had he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repudiation . And she repeated it , as if he had given her too much to bear ; as if for her own reassurance ; as if to efface even the memory of his words : No ; no ; no ! ' She began again to walk toward the house . Had it not been for the initiation that had passed , he knew so clearly now , in all unawareness from her spirit to his , he would have felt to the full the shame of his rejection , the deserved shame . For he was a stranger and she had given him no right to believe that she even liked him . But he could feel no shame . Had he really thought that she could love him ? Had it not been only that he wanted to tell her that he loved her , and had wanted her , as it were , to keep him safe ? He found himself trying to explain this to her , ? not pleading , ? only so that she should not be angry . ' I had to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything came different . Really , I 'm not so presumptuous . I never meant to ask anything . ' But she was not angry . ' Forgive me , ' she said . ' I hardly know what I am saying . You so astonished me . Forgive me . But I do n't feel as if I knew you at all . Please do n't think me reproaching you . I begin to understand . You are not at all strong . It was like the other day when you cried . I mean ? I feel sure you think you care for me ; but you could n't have said it , when we know each other so little , if you had been well . ' She was putting it aside , for his sake , as an aberration , and he really smiled a little as he shook his head . ' No ; really , really , it 's not that ; not because I 've been on edge and ill . It was something that came to me from what you are ; something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know that I am nothing to you ; but for a moment , just now , it seemed , when I had received so much , that you must know what you had given ; it seemed that a person to whom so much could be given , could not be so far away . But even then I saw quite clearly what you saw in me : a vain , pretentious , emotional creature ; insincere , too , and proud of my suffering . I ant that . But I had never seen it before . And when it came to me from you and , instead of crushing me , lifted me up , I knew that I loved you . ? No ; I wo n't try to explain . Only you do forgive me ? You will let me go on as if it had n't happened ? I promise you that I ' II never trouble you again . ' Oh , the gentleness , the heavenly gentleness ! It breathed through him like the color of the crocuses , although she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they . He was nothing to her ? nothing ; but she stood before him , looking at him , and though she gave nothing but the gentleness , he knew that he received all that heneeded . It was enough that she was there . But it 's I to be forgiven ? I , ' she repeated . ' Of course we will go on . Oh , you look very tired . Please take my arm again . I spoke so strangely to you . But ? but ? ' She had flushed : for the first time he saw the color darken her face as if with a veil of pain , and in her voice was the passion , deeper , stiller , that he had heard a little while ago and that had enfranchised him . ' I am married ? I mean , my husband is dead , but I am married . Perhaps you do n't understand . Perhaps you will some day if you should lose someone you love and feel them still your very life . We were like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing more as they walked up the meadow to the house , his arm in hers . He had no sense of loss ; rather , from her last words to him , came a sense of further gain . She would be like that . He saw now that her peace , against which lie had pressed and protested , was something won , was depth , not emptiness . She , too , had lost and suffered . She was made dearer to him , more sacred . As for his love , it did not belong ? he had seen this even before she told him why ? to this everyday world to which he had returned . But it was everything to have found it , with that other world , and to know that there it had its being , its reality , forever . What was it that had enlarged , transformed his life , but that very certitude of an eternity where all good was secure ? He could not explain it to himself in any words . Words were the keys of temporality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few shining moments , that Ronnie was not lost ; that nothing had been in vain . If he found no difficulty , it was evident to him that Mrs. Baldwin felt none , and he was glad to believe that this might be because he showed her so completely , in his candid contentment , that he would never trouble her again . She was not more kind to him ; but she took , perhaps , even more care , as if feeling that she had miscalculated something in his recovery . She inaugurated a glass of hot milk , instead of spiced hot water , at bedtime , and a rest on the sofa , with a rug , before the midday dinner . ' You will look so much better when you go back than when you came , ' she said . For the time of going back drew near , and he did not dread it , though loving Thatches and all it meant more and more with every day . But of course , even in the temporal world , he was not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The P.G . would be welcome whenever he cared to come . V He was playing chess on the afternoon before his departure . Tea was over and Mrs. Baldwin had gone out . Guy had noticed that she had been perhaps a little stiller than usual that day , when he had seen her , and that he had seen her little . The game did not go very well ; they were neither of them keen on it ; and when the old gentleman had won an easy victory , he leaned back in his chair , the board still on its little table between them , and said , Poor Effie ! She 's still in the church , or in the churchyard , I expect . ' Guy felt the shock of a great surprise . Strangely enough , though Mrs. Baldwin had spoken of her husband and of his death , and though his books were there , he did not associate him with Thatches , nor with the churchyard . And with the word , churchyard , ' a painful anxiety rose in him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , ' Mr. Haseltine nodded , sighing and rubbing his hand over his head . CROCUSES September twenty-ninth . I 'd forgotten myself till just a little while ago . Oliver died on this day . Her husband . Poor Effie ! ' They lived here ? ' Guy asked . He had imagined that it had been after her bereavement that she and her father had found and made a home of Thatches . ' Oh , yes . They lived here . All their married life , ' said Mr. Haseltine . ' Ten years or so . It was a great love-match . They were very happy . I never saw a happier couple ? until the end . ' Did anything part them ? ' Mr. Haseltine had put his hands into his pockets and was gazing at the board as if with a painful concentration , and though ho shook his head he answered , It was the malady . Cancer , you know . Cancer of the face . Such a handsome fellow , too : beautiful , bright , smiling eyes ; beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with horrible suffering . ' Guy felt his breath coining thickly . Was it long ? ' he asked . Yes . Long . Eighteen months , I think . Morphia did little good at last . He could n't swallow ; could hardly speak ; begged to be killed and put out of his torment . She was with him in it all . She never left him , day or night ; nor could he have borne it if she had . Nothing quieted him except her hand in his . But at the end , ' said Mr. Haseltine , pushing away the table and rising , at the end , it attacked his brain and then he raved at her . She could n't go into the room at the last . ' The old man , with step lagging , as if weighted , walked away to the window and stood looking out , while Guy , at the table , felt his heart turn to stone . Poor Effie ! ' Mr. Haseltine repeated after a little while . He came back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the books and pictures . ' She has never been the same AUTUMN CROCUSES since . For a long while we were afraid she could n't live . She hardly slept for months ; and when she did sleep , she used to wake crying , crying , always for him . When she became stronger , she used to walk up and down those meadows , sometimes for hours at a time . Very gentle ; no complaint ; always ready to talk to people , to go on with things as best she could ; but changed ; completely changed . We speak very little of him ; but when we do , it 's quite naturally . She goes to the church sometimes , and there are always flowers on his grave ; but I do n't think she has any orthodox beliefs ; I do n't know that she has any beliefs at all . Still , she seems helped . She is a very dear , unselfish woman ; a dreamer , she was always a dreamer ; but always meaning well ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think she likes this plan of having people come and stay and seeing after them ; especially now that they are so often people who have had a bad time . Dear me , dear me ! ' Mr. Haseltine again shook his head , stationed again at the window and looking out . ' You would hardly have recognized her had you seen her ten years ago . She had bright hair and a charming color ; and full of gayety and mischief . You ' d hardly believe it now . ' ' I 'm so sorry , ' Guy heard himself saying . He remembered that those were the words Mrs. Baldwin had used to him about Ronnie . ' Yes , it 's very sad , ' said Mr. Haseltine . ' Life is certainly very difficult for some of us , and Effie has had her share . Somehow one does n't remember it when one is with her . I only recalled the day by chance . ' Guy was walking in the meadows when Mrs. Baldwin returned . He saw her in the garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his first impulse was to remove himself as speedily as might be from her sight , to cross the bridge and the farther meadow , and turn into the lane that led away from it . But then he saw , as he stood irresolute , that she was coming down to him , and he stood there , helpless , watching her approach in the soft radiance of the late afternoon . She wore one of the lavender-colored dresses and the little knitted jacket . In her hand were the opened letters . Her face was tranquil . She was , of course , unaware of what had happened to him . She joined him . ' You are having your last look at the crocuses ? ' It was their last look together . That , of course , was why she had come , full of care and of kindness . ' Yes . Yes . My last look for the year . ' He heard that his voice was strange . And his heart seemed to lie like a cold hard block in his side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . He walked beside her in silence . What could he say ? But how was it possible not to tell her ? They had turned toward the sunset and came now to the bridge . She was looking at him , with solicitude . He stopped before they crossed . ' I must say something to you , ' broke from him . ' I must . I ca n't go away without your knowing ; ? my shame ? my unutterable remorse . ' She looked at him with the look he knew so well . Kindly , firmly , if with anxiety , she prepared to hear him thrust some new torment upon her . ' Shame ? Remorse ? ' she murmured . ' About my poems . About my griefs . What I 've said to you . What I 've given you to bear . I thought I 'd borne so much . I thought you unfeeling , without experience . I thought I 'd been set apart ? that all of us had been set apart , who suffered in the war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from me . But your father told me , just now , about your husband 's death . ' She became very pale . She looked away from him , but she said nothing . That 's all , ' said Guy after a long silence . He saw that there was nothing more to tell her . She had understood . Let us walk up and down , ' said Mrs. Baldwin . They crossed the bridge . He saw the stream sliding brightly below them between the old , black planks . In the farther meadows the crocuses grew more thickly and opened widely their pale purple chalices . We have all suffered , ' said Mrs. Baldwin . ' You must n't have remorse or shame . Nothing is harmed between tie . ' The horrible stricture around his heart relaxed , and as they went very slowly up and down he felt his throat tighten and tears rising , rising to his eyes . He could not keep them back . He was n't really quite strong enough for this . They fell and fell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to brush them away . We have all suffered , ' Mrs. Baldwin repeated gently . Some , more ! some , more ! ' he said brokenly . ' Some , most of all ! ' They came back to the bridge , but though they crossed over , they did not pass out through the high gate that barred the other end . The gate was closed , and Guy stopped at it and leaned on it and put his face on his hands . Mrs. Baldwin stood at the gatepost beside him , her hand laid on it and her head leaned against her hand . He would have liked you , ' she said . He was so interested in young men , young poets . He was not old himself ; and he wrote , too , did you know ? All those books in the living-room are his .
