 | I was sent to Russia fresh from college to be a missionary . I had my choice among China , Turkey and Russia . Russia was described as a " boiling kettle of moral madness , " more turbulent , more hopeless , more awful in its needs than any other land . I decided to try to help out Russia . Before I got over the sensation of being shadowed by a police spy or had ceased to look for smoking bombs lying along the curbstones , I found myself squarely confronted by that first great task of missionaries ? the language . The missionary is one of the few foreigners for whom a mastery of the new tongue is an unavoidable obligation and one of the prime conditions of his success . It was something of a shock . " Declensions and conjugations , declensions and conjugations , " was all the reply I could get when I presented myself to help Russia . Alas , and I remembered the dispiriting words of my old Latin professor , " You 'll never be a linguist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " How long will this preliminary task take ? " I asked , rather impatiently . " Eight years , " said my new Russian friends ; " four years , " said my countrymen ; " six months , " said I ! There was nothing for it but to follow the same road of drudgery the others had taken . Russia would have to wait . So I nailed " Declensions and conjugations in the name of the Lord ! " over my door and set eagerly to work . I was at once banished from the society of my friends by being established in an obscure Russian family which neither knew nor cared to know English . I was " written in " by the police and given a card of identification and protection by the head of the mission " in case it should be suddenly required . " Living thru the first few weeks was a terrible experience . The eternal and ubiquitous glasses of weak tea and lemon , the strange cooking , the unbelievably late hours , the viscous , sluggish flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity , the general silence on political matters , and the deadening , oppressive spirit of laissez-faire , of fated helplessness , of cynicism , discouragement and gloom ? I was stunned and puzzled by the sudden shock of such an environment , became weak with despair , and was overwhelmed by attacks of loneliness and spiritual fears which it would be impossible to describe . My little room high up in a vast , thick-walled qvarteer on Zhukovsky street was the usual Russian affair . The pictureless walls and high ceiling were made of cheerless white plaster ; the single , double-paned window was set in thick stone walls hermetically sealed up with putty , with bits of colored cloth sprinkled over the white cotton padding stuffed between the panes . How often that first winter did I stare thru that window like a prisoner and watch the ceaseless languid falling of the snow thru the chill , black winter air ! As for furniture : a bare wardrobe stood in the corner like a coffin on end ; a small hospital cot faced it ; and near the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glassy piyachka or stove . It was a ghostly , pallid , lonely room . I found some consolation in my haziaka or landlady , for she proved to be an excellent teacher . She taught me my first word ? shlyapa for hat ? on my first visit , before I had even had time to see my room . I learned the names of all the objects on the table at the first meal . After dinner my haziaka and I played at a sort of Berlitz game at table . A knife became Ivan Ivanovitch ; a fork , Maria Ivanovna ; a plate became their home , dam ; a napkin ring , the street car ,  | vagon ; a bun with a hole in it , the store , lafka ; and a handful of lemon seeds , the children , dyaiti . And forth we fared daily on our syntactical adventures ! I put my culinary manikins thru all the paces known to normal and well regulated families , while I described their activities to the haziaka in choicely mangled Russian . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on some twelve or thirteen different verbs all meaning " to go , " it became positively exciting . Never were Slavonic verbs and nouns more unfeelingly outraged . Never were man and wife and numerous progeny compelled to submit to a more strenuous public and private life ! Often indeed my mind was so bent on matters of grammatical moment that my Ivan , I fear , was committed to a rather melodramatic career of alternating vice and virtue . My haziaka , who was so stout that she seldom left the room , used often to forget herself , play the spectator instead of tutor , and so sympathize with the touching adventures of my manikins that , on looking up expecting a correction , I would find her kindly face streaming with tears ! I began my day with Russian words . I tacked blackboards and great sheets of wrapping paper all over my walls and kept them covered with vocabularies , declensions and graphic delineations of all the capers of the Russian verb . These wall decorations were the first things to greet my eyes on waking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work while drinking my coffee . The morning gave me four hours of intense study . At lunch I recited to the haziaka the fables I had committed to memory , she correcting me with splendid patience and severity . In the afternoon came a one to two hour lesson with my tutor . Then came tea at the Angleterre or Europe and a glance at the Russian newspapers ( with a stolen peep at the London Times or Paris Herald now and then just to see what really was happening at home ! ) In the evening I often held endless discussions with a young man from the mission . We talked with dictionaries in our hands ; we wore dictionaries out looking up new expressions . In those days I must have added thirty or forty words a day to my vocabulary . Even on the long walks which I took daily across the city to Vacilivsky Island for my lesson , I managed to turn the time to account . I pushed my way along the slushy sidewalks of the ponderous and sprawling city with my Boston bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not arouse ! ) of books tucked under one arm and an open book or piece of paper held in the hand of the other . Instead of whistling ( which , alas , is forbidden by the police ! ) , I repeated over and over some such word as vstrayteet , " to meet " ; the word for " fourteenth , " cheteernadtsati , or the popular **25;479;TOOLONG , which means " High Noble Excellency . " It is not at all unlikely that those who past by me while thus engaged thought that in my case " not everybody was at home , " as the Russians say . I had a way also of turning to advantage the incessant importunities of beggars . If he was a young or middle aged man ( and many of them were ) , I addrest him thus , " You want bread and I want the Russian language . Come , we will exchange . " And sometimes I had him walk across the city with me , paid his way on the ferry , and made him talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Prospect , I would enter a baker 's shop with him and pay for what he picked out . Once I remember , on quitting my unhappy , shivering benefactor , I gave him with my nursery vocabulary a sober and earnest talk on the evils of vodka drinking ! Then followed the daily two hours with that unique friend of the American colony in St. Petersburg , the enthusiastic and vivacious Russian tutor , Madame Pechugina . The slow journey home from the island included a pleasant ride across the Neva in the crawling , little , bug-like ferries , a stroll under the outstretched , benedictory hand of Peter the Great before the Senate , and a moment in that gloomy , Brobdingnagian temple , St. Isaac 's , to gaze at the sparkle and sheen of diamond-studded icons lit up in the darkness by sheaves of smoking tapers , or to repeat an Anglo-Saxon prayer before a Greek Orthodox shrine . And the blunders in speech I made in those early days ! For my first few days in St. Petersburg I was sheltered under the hospitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As I went out for a  | stroll each morning the swaitzar at the hall door made such a queer noise as 1 past him that I asked my friend one day what it meant . He asked me what it was like . I replied , " Like a sneeze . " He thought a moment and then laughed heartily . The queer noise was a single word , zdrayst-vuie-tse ! and means , " How do you do ? " After my twelfth lesson , I tried once to engage an izvoshchik or " drosky " on the Nevsky to take me home . I pronounced " Zhukofsky No . Eight " slowly , and with a correct ( as I thought ) and distinguished accent . The old fellow only shook his hairy head solemnly , not a spark of intelligence showing in his dull , azure eyes . Again I addrest him in his own tongue . He folded his stiff , cold hands inside his voluminous sleeves , stared at his horse 's tail and said nothing . I tried another driver and another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of Russian increast , that of the natives should decrease ! Once as a guest of a great Russian actor , I tried to say to him , " Oh , do n't bother about me , I beg you ! " but omitted the " about . " But I got my revenge when the time came to mingle with the youth of certain aristocratic families , and heard their " near " perfect English . The son of a distinguished family , in the presence of a varied company , once invited me to a fancy-dress ball , adding that I , as a foreigner , would be expected to wear only my " night dress " ! Since the ball began at midnight , there was some pith to his remark , after all ! In the end , I learned to talk . In a month , the language ceased to awe me and I began to detect and understand separate words and phrases . In two months I found myself holding actual converse with my Russian friends , with gestures used in the place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid table conversation and understand nearly everything , frequently juggling noun and adjective accurately myself . A poem recited in public , however , at this time was as unintelligible to me as if it had been in Chinese . About this time , too , I found I could separate the words of the little sing-song of the swathed and bearded peasant conductor on the tramcar when he asked for fares ? " Who not has a little ticket ? " The impassioned , sibilant swearing of the lomovois on their carts of mud and snow , also evolved from barbaric cries of anger into definite phrases with definite meanings ; the devil , it seemed , was the favorite tutelary genius loci , judging from the familiar manner in which they tost him back and forth across the cavernous thorofares . In six months , after a study of verb forms and idoms , I found myself at last no longer deaf and mute to the Russian life about me : I could laugh at jokes , express myself in a fashion even with my hands in my pockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and philosophy . It was something to my advantage , I believe , that no one ever spoke slowly to make it easier for me to understand . As it seems now , it was the flow of speech rather than the separate words , that I strove to grasp . In fact , Russian has always seemed to be a tongue especially made for the lips , as French has seemed made for the eyes and English for the pen . And I began to think in the new tongue . I know that I addrest the people of my dreams in Russian ; and in that felicitous kingdom , be it known , I was understood by all ! I learned to remember words on once hearing them , and thus my progress at this stage was necessarily rapid . To understand was not difficult ; reading was a laborious task ; composition was , and still is , an uncut Gordian knot . It was only after a full year of study , however , that my Russian ceased in a degree to be translated English syntax , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexpressibly forcible and picturesque turns of Russian colloquial speech , and to make little speeches to my classes in the mission . Poetry and Turgenev alone were beyond me . Having already begun to roam far afield among the rare , exotic literary treasures of Russia , I felt my enthusiasm grow for the profound beauties hidden deep in the mystic , passionate , moody souls of this great people . The acquisition of a foreign tongue , they say , is equivalent to adding ten years to one 's life . So it seemed to me then when , all of a sudden , as it were , I found myself listening to the secrets , mysteries and broodings of a race so to- tally different from my own . When , as often happened , 1 found myself one of a group of Russian friends where there were no formalities or embarrassments , the sense of entering so thoroly , so deeply into these ingenuous , kindly lives kept me self-conscious in spite of myself and filled me ever with a reverence for the responsibilities of my post and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's first duty is to be happy , " announces a big , beaming merchant at a typical Russian gathering at a Wednesday jour-fixe . " Man 's first duty is to love himself ! " replies a thin , elderly lawyer who never wins cases but is famous for his playing of Beethoven 's sonatas . " To get into his grave with as little disturbance as possible ? that is the greatest obligation and privilege of man , " growls a decadent young poet . No one pleads the case of work ! And there one may sit and hear matrons , debutantes , students and domestic philosophers unsheath their weapons of conversation ( and whose weapons cut and flash like the Russian 's ? ) for a spirited defense of the most astounding and original doctrines . What the Russian language lacks in softness and beauty of sound , is more than compensated for by its extraordinary flexibility , its phonetic orthography , and its verbal felicities . Those plu perfect tenses that are at best exprest clumsily in English , are handled in Russian with fine adroitness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malleable and yielding is the Russian language by reason of this rich and happy facility for external and internal inflection , of power of word combination ( like the German ) , of a highly developt system of suffixes and affixes , of special forms for diminutive , carressing , intensive , contemptuous and heroic ideas so inexhaustible seem the resources of this principal Slavonic tongue , that the student ultimately finds himself exclaiming with Professor William Lyon Phelps of Yale : " Surely here is a tongue that makes English , French and German seem like mere dialects ! " One has but to read Gnedich 's translation of the Odyssey , the Constantine Shakespeare , or the Synod 's New Testament to realize this . " In the days of doubt , " wrote Turgenev prophetically , the year before he died , " in the days of sad ponderings over the fate of my country , thou alone art my star and support , O great , powerful , just and free Russian tongue ! However much we are seized by despair because of what is happening among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a language was not given to a great people . "
