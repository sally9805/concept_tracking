 | ONE of the greatest social needs of today is for a mental , moral , industrial and financial clearing-house of ideas , where the principles , aims and methods of the leading trades and professions may be interchanged and improved . A teacher or minister could often learn more about his own work from a manufacturer than from another teacher or minister . There are about 250,000 manufactories in the United States , with about 7,000,000 employees , and a yearly output valued at $30,000,000 , - 000 . Any field of such magnitude is worthy of close study by a man with a man 's size ambition . A more vital reason for knowing factory conditions lies in the certainty that the families of employers and employees are directly affected by these conditions . The health , prosperity , morality and usefulness of perhaps 25,000,000 people thus depend on the right management of the factory systems of this country . Furthermore , every one of us gains or loses by the way in which factories are conducted ? most of our clothing , work appliances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a factory mark . The owner or manager of a great modern factory must know , or know where to find out , at least 10,000 different things , a few hundred of which we will barely suggest in this article . CONSULT AN EXPERT The first thing to do , when making a plan for a factory building , is to consult a competent authority , known as an " industrial engineer , " and certified by some national organization such as the American Institute of Consulting Engineers or the American Society of Mechanical Engineers . You need an expert 's advice , from cellar to roof . In choosing a location , these are a few primary points for you and the architectural engineer to determine : superiority of city or suburb ; area needed and cost of land ; wages demanded in that section ; proximity and abundance of labor , materials and power supply ; weather and climate as affecting work and workers ; shipping facilities ; market for products ; home sites for employees . The building must be adapted to its own specific use . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you collected and compared minute descriptions of other factory build ings and systems ? a score to a hundred ? What will be your machinery equipment , where and how disposed ? How will your delivery scheme be most effective and economical , incoming for materials , outgoing for products , retaining for materials and products in storage ? How should the yards , tools , desks , departments , be arranged according to the principle of scientific management ? Have you figured in detail your designs , estimates and costs , with all specifications minute and proportional ? Does your finished plan allow for changes , extensions and improvements later on , without injury to the building or to the scheme of manufacture ? What kind of building offers the lowest insurance rates , the least depreciation , the largest salvage ? CHOOSING THE MATERIALS The structure may be of wood , or wood and brick walls , or steel frame and brick or hollow tile or concrete walls , or reinforced concrete frame and brick or concrete walls . About sixty-one per cent of all the structural material employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast changing to a preference for concrete ? in 1890 the output of cement was 300,000 barrels , but in 1913 it was over 89 , - 550,527 barrels . The yearly depreciation of wood is about one and onequarter per cent , while that of concrete is less than half of one per cent . The insurance rate on wood buildings ( with contents ) is 100 to 125 cents per $100 , while that on concrete buildings ( with contents ) is only twenty to forty-five , approximately . A wood building may cost $100 , - 000 and a concrete $140,000 , on first estimates . But in the long run they will cost about the same , owing to the lesser depreciation of concrete , its lower insurance , its weather-resistance , its non-susceptibility to vibration and oscillation , its evenness of temperature , and smaller demand for power supply . Among the advantages of concrete are that it is fireproof , waterproof and verminproof , easy and economical to build , allows more windows and less walls , gains strength and solidity with age . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no salvage value , may be damp , looks ugly , makes machinery connections difficult and future extensions almost impossible . An advantage of hollow tile is the insulation of the building from heat and cold . The only safe way is to think long and compare widely before specifying the material . Now as to floors . A floor may be a thief . Do you know that a certain type of floor , for example , robs the workers of the normal body heat so that they feel excessively and prematurely tired ? Also , it adds to nervestrain and foot-fatigue because of the hardness of its compact . Molding-rooms may need a mastic and asphalt composition , concrete or brick floor , forge-shops an earth or cinder floor , car-houses a concrete base and granolithic finish , machineshops a creosoted wood plank on concrete base , offices a maple or yellow pine over concrete . Your choice of a roof is even more complex ; it may be tile , or tin , or slate , or shingles , or composition , or asbestos , or sheet metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points to consider , in specifying a roof , are its ventilation , illumination , watershedding capacity , endurance , appearance , low cost of repair , suitability to the nature of the factory . The matter of fire protection is a very serious one . About 2000 fires occur every year in the factory buildings of the United States , with a money loss of $25,000 each or more ? usually much more . Nearly all might be prevented by such means of foresight as these : fireproof building materials ; protection of steel framing with brick , tile or concrete ; self-closing doors ; windows with metal shutters ; cut-off walls ; hollow metal and asbestos wood partitions ; separation of belt towers by brick partitions with fire doors ; separate outside stairways ; automatic sprinklers , fire alarms and extinguishers ; frequent inspections and fire drills ; red lights at all exits ; inflammable materials fully enclosed ; order and cleanliness thruout the factory ; printed fire instructions posted largely in prominent places . THE WORKER 'S LUNGS A worker 's efficiency may vary as much as thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the purity , humidity , and circulation of the air . It is now fashionable , and desirable , to wash the air in a big factory . As many as 221,000 particles of dust have been counted in a single cubic foot of air on lower Broadway , New York . Dust , being a conglomeration of the worst kinds of filth , must be kept out of the organ- ism of the most effective worker . The heating system should also be a ventilating system . The modern " fan " system of heating largely solves this problem , by keeping the air in circulation , and preventing cold ' rafts from outside tho forcing gentle currents of pure air into all the rooms of the factory . The average steam engine uses only about twenty per cent of its heat production in work radiation , leaving about eighty per cent unused . Why not heat your building by utilizing all this waste ? The exterior walls of factories are now mostly glass . Many structures have window areas of seventy-five per cent of their whole outer surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one single factor is as important as light , whether natural or artificial , as an aid in keeping production at a high efficiency thruout the entire working day . " Another says : " Light is more valuable than space . The factories erected today probably require and get fifty per cent more light than was common a generation ago . " INEFFICIENT DARKNESS Experts declare that twenty - five per cent of all the avoidable accidents in factories are due to poor illumination , On dark days , certain factories have lost an average of an hour a day for each employee ; yet a labor improvement or increase of only four minutes daily per man will generally pay for the installation of a good lighting system . A fine scheme of illumination reduces errors , increases production , lowers manufacturing costs , lessens the eye-strain , fatigue , headache , nervousness and irritability of employees , adds to cheerfulness of surroundings , and therefore to the willing spirit of workers , renders supervision easier and more economical , promotes hygiene , cleanliness and order , prevents loss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . Electric light seems to be the only kind fulfilling all the conditions : that it be ample , uniform , steady , mild , shaded but concentrated , both general and specific . An overhead system is better than drop lights ; but drops are also needed on close , fine work . A low ceiling indicates small lamps in large numbers ; a twelvefoot ceiling takes sixty- to 100-watt tungsten lamps , instead of a glaring arc lamp , while a fifty-foot ceiling calls for perhaps 500-watt tungsten lamps . Efficient reflectors . glass usually being preferred , may increase the power of illumination as much as sixty per cent . The lighting system should be inspected daily if possible , for renewals , cleaning , repairs and so forth . Color is an important factor . Ceilings should be white , or some tint very near white . Green , or buff , or blue , somewhat darker but still light in shade , with a few ornamental panels , would be desirable for the walls . From the standpoint of health nothing is more vital to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry subsoil , prevention of sewer gases , immediate removal of waste , constant ingress of pure air , incineration of garbage and other refuse . A remarkable feature of modern factory ownership lies in the phrase , " Beauty serves utility . " Flowers , drives , and fountains , model cottages and other attractions , now form an integral part of the business scheme of the largest manufacturing plants , with bright colors , mottoes , pictures and statuary gracing the interiors . MACHINES AND EFFICIENCY When Charles W. Eliot , President Emeritus of Harvard , said " No man should be employed at a task which a machine can perform , " he put into words one of the great Efficiency truths of modern industry . The more the factory man of today eliminates human labor , the more efficient he makes his plant and the more productive he makes the labor of the human machines he employs . This brings to mind a large factory where the old-fashioned trucking system has been well nigh eliminated by the installation of a mechanical conveyor system which carries on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of manufacture , climbing from floor to floor , running along the ceiling , crossing the street to the packing room , and finally , delivering the finished product , in great boxes and cases , to the warehouse . A complementary device utilizes the cheapest power known . Down smooth spiral chutes goes the mechandise , not only annihilating the space between floors but speeding up ( or rather down ) the delivery of the product , saving thousands of steps and reducing the pay roll . Many another example of progress in factory economy thru judicious selection of labor saving machinery might be cited . But these are typical and sufficient for my purpose here . The point is this . Study your manufacturing problem closely ? do not rest till you are on speaking terms with every machine on the market which will save a step or speed along your product . TEACH WORKERS HOW TO WORK In the last few years it has been discovered that workers do not know how to work . There may be 100 ways of doing the same job ? and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locate and eliminate the ninety-nine wrong methods , how to evolve and establish the one right method : this is the great problem of the manufacturer . An authority states that , because of incompetence of both employers and employees , in the trades alone " the loss is probably more than sufficient to pension , under full pay , one-half of the workers of the ' country . " To put it concretely , half the motions of the 30,000,000 workers in the United States are utterly wasted . Probably nine-tenths of their thoughts are also wasted . Teach a man how to work and how to think -- and you make him at least 300 per cent more valuable to the business and to himself . Scientific management teaches him how to work , and personal efficiency teaches him how to think . The Taylor plan of scientific management is based on ( a ) scientific system of work , ( b ) scientific choice of the man for his work , ( c ) scientific training of the man in his work , ( d ) scientific promotion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasks should be set only as the result of scientific investigation , and on the basis of mutual interest , benefit and satisfaction . Mr. Taylor himself defines it thus : " Science , not rule of thumb ; harmony , not discord ; cooperation , not individualism ; maximum output , in place of restricted output ; the development of each man to his greatest efficiency and prosperity . " An outline , condensed , of the Taylor system , we give as follows : 1 . Find ten or fifteen men in a given trade peculiarly skilled in the work to be analyzed. 2 . Study their exact series of elementary motions or operations , with implements used . 3 . Study with a stop-watch the time required to make such elementary movements , then select the quickest way of doing each . 4 . Eliminate all slow , false and useless movements . 5 . Collect into one series the quickest and best movements , as well as the best implements . 6 . Standardize all work accordingly , and train workers in new methods . 7 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , impelling and educating workers . By the Taylor system , unusual results have been achieved . In a bicycle factory the working period was shortened from ten and a half to eight and a half hours , the pay and the output remained the same , and the accuracy was two-thirds greater than at the former slow rate . In a big steel plant , employees were taught to load forty-seven and a half  | tons of pig iron daily instead of their usual amount of twelve and a half tons ; their average earnings were increased from $1.15 to $1.88 daily ; the savings to the company ran , from $35,000 to $80,000 yearly . A very simple example is that of a girl in an office who applied the principles to herself and learned to stamp 110 envelopes a minute . Next to Mr. Taylor , the leader in this field is perhaps Mr. Gilbreth . He has revolutionized the ancient , onerous and profitless trade of the bricklayer , till now it comes under the dignity and reward of skilled labor . On the Gilbreth system a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former systemless average of 120 per hour . Mr. Gilbreth says : " Wherever motion study has been applied , the workman 's output has been doubled . " A manufacturer , indeed any em ployer and any employee , unfamiliar with Taylor and Gilbreth , has overlooked a fine chance for at least a forty per cent gain in working output and ' income . INCENTIVES TO BETTER WORK There is a human side , and a purely mechanical side , to industrial management . Each is indispensable , neither may safely be neglected . No man ever did his best merely for wages . We have the statement of an authority : " The average workman engaged in construction work under the wage system is capable of increasing his output seventy per cent if given sufficient incentive to do so , and this without the least physical injury to himself . " And the same truth applies to the mental worker , as I know from experience . A little reflection will show how unfair the wage method of payment is to both employer and employee , since flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The newer and better systems include the following : Bonus system . Worker is paid a regular minimum wage , with piecerate award in addition . Differential piece-rate system ( Taylor ) . Worker is paid minimum for piece jobs , with higher rate for daily output over a certain amount . Task work with bonus system ( Gantt ) . Worker is paid regular daily wage , and lump bonus if he reaches fixed standard of output ( bonus usually about one-third of wages ) . Premium system ( Towne-Halsey ) . Worker is paid bonus , but means and methods are left to the men , not ordained by the manager .  | Stint system . Worker is paid regular wage for specified amount of work , then given all spare time left after completing job ( this often equals one to two days a week ) . Among other incentive systems are the old age pensions , employeepartnerships and stock holdings , mutual insurance policies , and various benefit plans . A business that pays nothing but wages is found wanting by modern efficiency standards . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every manufacturer . An expert gives these rules : Standardize all items on minimum estimate from experience ; eliminate dead work ; push every man and machine to capacity , but not beyond ; have all work done by machines where possible ; use low-priced men for low-priced work ; transport and handle pieces in groups , not singly ; make all designs in office , not in field ; figure all cost items as percentages of total , and reduce accordingly ; employ night shifts , to cut down overhead ; do most profitable part of work first , to stop interest charges ; avoid accidents by inspections , instructions and precautions . A scientific method of finding and keeping costs is fundamental to factory success . A cost-finding system should precede a cost-keeping system . Various methods are available : The estimate and test plan , the specific plan , the sold-hour plan , the machine-hour plan , the list-percentage plan , and so forth . Have you become familiar with all these plans ? Welfare work is more and more engaging the attention of the shrewdest manufacturers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide hot dinners , cooked hygienically and served attractively , at cost price to your employees , you add perhaps ten per cent to their working power in the afternoon . At the Krupp works in Germany the families of the workers join , eat , make merry and get acquainted in the company dining-hall ! Here we have one secret of the solidarity of the German fighting machine . Welfare work now includes welfare secretaries , clubs and associations , vocational books and courses , factory libraries , evening lectures , classes , and musical entertainments , restaurants , cooking and sewing classes , visits of nurses and attendance by physicians , pure water in abundance for drinking and bathing , liquid soap and individual towels and drinking cups , " First Aid " and " Safety First " instructions , vegetable and flower gardens , playgrounds , swimming pools , rest rooms , lawns and parks , roof garden , gymnasiums , ball clubs , annual outings , even music to accompany the work ! Said an official in a tobacco factory where Mexican peons were employed : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day a fairy tale , with the regulation princess and ' dragon ! " We do not advise the telling of a large number of fairy tales in your factory ( or about your goods ) . But we do rejoice that the spirit of romance and idealism is being made to serve a wholly utilitarian purpose ? and thus to prove its practicality . Put briefly , the twelve general principles of modern factory management are these : 1 . Standards of time and motion , tools , costs , output . 2 . Educational supervision , oral and printed instructions , for training employees in physical and mental efficiency . 3 . Subdivision of duties , minimum number to each man , and man chosen to fit the tasks . 4 . Coordination of groups or departments right relationships of work and workers . 5 . Separation of plan and execution , with specialists for head work as for hand work . 6 . Regular unit cost reports for study and comparison . 7 . Increasing rewards , with some form of piece-rate system made to supplement or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fostering of the game or contest spirit between groups or individuals . 9 . Prompt pay , by cash , not check , with daily or weekly statements of exact amount earned . 10 . Managerial authority and dignity , social exclusion but industrial inclusion . 11 . Sustained quality of product , means taken to ensure pride of workers in it and favor of public for it . 12 . Welfare work ( not charity or paternalism ) , aiming at recreation , education , health , sociability , comfortable and happy home life of employees . The great new business principle of the twentieth century may be summed in a few words : The interests of employer and employee are identical ; neither gains or loses without corresponding gain or loss by the other ; hence the problems of each vitally concern the other and must be solved by impartial study , mutual respect , scientific sympathy , joint endeavor.
