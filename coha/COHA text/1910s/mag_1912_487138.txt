still existing in almost ? inaccessible deserts , built long ages aka as an Earthly Paradise , bereft of its idolatrous and impious inhabitants by the sudden vengeance of Allah , and-known only by the report of a solitary and straying traveller who has stumbled upon it . This city in the Koran is called " Irem of the Columns , " and in the line of an Arab poet , " Irem round which the Jinn hover . " It was built in the deserts of Aden by Sheddad , the son of Ad , the grandson of Aus , and so , possibly , the whole country might be called the Land of Aus or Uz . On the story in general the quickest reference is to the commentators on the Koran , lxxxix , 4 . It has found its way also into the current or Egyptian recension of the Arabian Nights , and was , of course , known to Abdullah Mansfir ( p. xxiii ) . But within the reading of the present reviewer " Uz " is always the name of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a geographical term , and further ( ii ) , this south Arabian " Uz " is never connected with Job . It would be exceedingly interesting  --  for many reasons , Biblical and otherwise  --  to know if there is a legend of Job actually domiciled in the deserts near Aden . But leaving history and legend for the Life and situations of the present , this is an extraordinarily vivid and real book . There is not a scrap of humdrum travel-talk in it , and the writer has a quite peculiar gift both as describer and raconteur . He evidently fears an accusation of anecdotal flippancy , but has most fortunately taken his risks . His vocabulary is picturesque and is used judiciously ; there is no fine writing , but he makes his points . He records here ten years spent at Aden as a British " political , " in this case a subordinate official whose business it was to know all about the neighboring Arab tribes and to deal with them , personally and by correspondence , in every way short of military force . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interior , even a crossing of the southwest corner of the Empty Quarter itself  --  one of the great blanks lamented by geographers . In punitive or boundary expeditions he had also a part , being in charge up to the firing of the first shot , when the military officer commanding would step in . With such opportunities he learned to know the people thoroughly ; their tribal constitutions from the great sultanates down in their tangle of feuds and alliances ; the different types of the population , from the tribal fighting caste in their fortified eyries to the soft pacific traders of the coast and the unwalled towns . The life of children and women even was open to him , for womankind among the free Arabs have a very different standing from what is theirs elsewhere in Islam . We have sympathetic little vignettes of girls of the upper classes in hill fastnesses and of little shepherdesses of the masses on the mountain sides ; of haps of love and marriage and even of the social status and influence of nautch-girls . Of business and agriculture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is far more of these than the traveller in northern or central Arabia would guess at . Arabia Felix was no grim Latin Jest , and it still bears more than frank-incsnse.and coffee .. On religion he touch-es , but what he knows of it was picked up most casually . Evidently the fewer the theological questions started on either side , the better . His people took him for granted and he did not disturb them . But on superstitions , from saints it their graves and the gifts they can still bestow , through tales of Bahlulwould he had told us more about ham ! ? to snake-charms and magic snakes with their deadly jewels , the virtues of cold iron  --  not steel  --  and appearances of the Jinn , he is strong . It is curious to ' observe how he , like all long dwellers in the East in intimate touch with the people , is coming to have the Oriental openness of mind on such things . This is not to his discredit ; rather , when carefully guarded , to his credit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the S ? yids  --  descendants of the Prophet  --  have occult powers which no legerdemain or hypnotic feats could explain . In this , of course , he is not reckoning with that strange defect in human watchfulness which , as we now know , is so hard to eliminate One Se-yid gave him a baraka , " blessing , " here profanely but pretty closely translated " mascot , " in the form of a strip from his sacred banner . On the Jinn he is not so explicit . The panic terrors which they strike are evidently hard to explain , but he gives malaria its full weight as the wreaker of their vengeance . A subject on which we would gladly have heard more is that of the desert poems of the present day . Elsewhere in Arabia we know that the tradition of subject , form , and manner  --  even of mannerisms  --  has run unchanged from before the time of Mohammed Here we learn only that the South Arabian dweller in the desert is expected to be able to improVise in correct blank ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Otherwise he is regarded as imperfectly educated No real specimens of such verse are given , only two or three tags . But again and again we have pictures of just such thunderbursts in the hills and of the wadies coming down full from bank to bank in roaring spate that the old poets painted so often and in such detail . A genuine Song of the Well , too , is given ( p. 200 ) ; as the Israelites in the wilderness , so the tribes still sing to the desert source of life . Another obscure point is the south Arabian use of the word " dervish " to mean a confirmed bachelor ( pp. 174 , 271 ff . ) . For if there is one thing that holds of dervishes elsewhere in Islam , it is that they are in no way necessarily celibate and that " dervish " has no such association for the Moslem as " monk " or " friar " for us . That it means also " wanderer " suggests that the " tertiary " dervishes , so common elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round Mecca are multitudes of Senusite tertiaries . On one side only is the book irritating and unsatisfactory . The precision of the trained philologist is not to be looked for in a man who has learned his Arabic on the ground . But it is fortunately seldom that so good a book has so hopelessly bad a system  --  if it is a system  --  of writing Arabic words . CURRENT FICTION . NOVELS OF DISILLUSION . A Woman of Genius . By Mary Austin . New York- Doubleday , Page &; Co . A Man 's World . By Albert Edwards . New York : The Macmillan Co . The autobiographical form is among the most ancient implements of the story-teller . There is no better way of beginning a tale than " Once on a time there dwelt at Bagdad. . . . " unless it be " I was born in the City of York , of a good family , though not of that country . . . . " The first person singular , if skilfully employed , is capable of covering a multitude of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such faults do not exist it is commonly an asset . What would Sherlock Holmes be without his Dr. Watson ? And what Allan Quatermain as interpreted by a mere author ? Allan Quatermain , Henry Esmond , John Ridd , belong to the older type of interlocutor . The business of their pens , as of their lives , is romance . But the present generation is bringing us a more subtle and sophisticated type of autobiographical story . It is the product of naturalism , but not of that robust and cheerful naturalism which belonged to " Moll Flanders " or the " Memoirs of a Lady of Quality . " The new note is plaintive , elegiac even . I have lived , more or less , I have loved , after ' a fashion , and what does it all amount to ? What is the meaning of the riddle ? What is the use ' , One striking fact about this mood , as echoed for example in the two narratives now before us , is that it is represented as a mood of maturity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exceptional ability who has succeeded iu the chosen task , and , at the very moment of success , finds that all is vanity , that real happiness positive success , has somehow been missed . The story of " A Woman of Genius " is in outline much like Theodore Dreiser 's " Sister Carrie . " A girl is born into a provincial Ameri can community with a genius for acting which in time brings her to the top of her profession , love and domestic happiness being left by the way . But Mrs. Austin 's Olivia is a far more intellectual person than Mr. Dreiser 's Carrie , and suffers proportionately in the end . She is , we are to understand , the victim of her genius . From the moment when her consciousness of it emerges , everything else becomes secondary . For its sake she loses the husband of her youth , and the lover of her prime whose mistress she has preferred to be rather than sacrifice her art . He wants a wife , and finds one , leaving Olivia forlorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If I had married Helmeth Garrett , " she says , " I might have grown insensible to him ; as it was , I seemed to have been fixed , though by pain , in the fruitful relation . The loss of him , the desperate ache , the start of memory , are just as good materials to build an artistic success upon as the joy of having . " So she goes on with hei- building , and the house of art has no secret chambers for her . " Whatever else has happened to me , I am at least a success , " is her summing up It is left for her to patch up a marital arrangement with a fellow-being who , finds himself in the same boat  --  a playwright whose " fruitful relations " are many , but who is no danger of demanding that she give up her career . In " A Man 's World " the plaintive and irresolute tune is even more distinctly audible . This is not , as the title might suggest , a story about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Genius , " sex plays a somewhat disproportionate part in these reminiscences , because the normal outlet of a happy marriage has been unattained . This is as undisguisedly the fault of the narrator in the man 's case as in the woman 's . And the man lacks that excuse of the torch-bearer which belongs to people of real or fancied genius . Arnold Whitman , like Olivia , progresses from a narrow rural upbringing to the life of cities He comes to New York as a bookworm and bibliographer , and remains as a criminologist , with an official position at the Tombs which makes him of great service in the cause of decency and justice . At this post we leave him , a man of practical achievement in a difficult field . But we leave him whining , a man of fifty whose life is over , who believes that all the world 's a stage , and that the play is a foolish one . " I have little ardor left .

" Vanity of vanities ! The trouble , as we have intimated , is a trouble of sex . Arnold Whitman has never thought of marriage as a part of the business of life . He has been the lover of one woman  --  who has preferred a career to marriage  --  and has gone so far as to wish that he might wish to marry another . And he apparently does not know what is the matter with him in the end We wonder iF his author does ! Between Two Thieves . By Richard Behan . New York : Frederick A Stokes Co . " As for England ?

" " Conditions , " too , are painted with liberal brushfuls of color . Boudoir . scenes under the Second Empire are only less scandalous than British barrack scenes in the fifties . The trouble is that the multitude of these revelations , and especially the manner of - them , call for much more horror than the average reader has " on tap .

The Joyous Adventures of Aristide Pujol . By W. J. Locke . New York : John Lane Co . Another is hereby added to Mr. Locke 's company of irresponsible heroes . M.

He is an " electric personage , " a " human dragon-fly , " and these pages through which he darts and flashes can by no possibility be dull . His adventures are not recorded in chronological order , but they make a sort of progress , leaving us at the end the picture of a tamed and domesticated though by no means dispirited Aristide . The stories , taken separately , are somewhat uneven in merit . AN APOSTLE OF WAR The Day of the Saxon By Homer Lea Harper &; Bros. $1 80 net The California undergraJduate who , some years ago , disappeared , to emerge in China in high military command , here renews his comment on the present martial balance of the world . America 's military destitution was the subject of " The Valor of Ignorance . " England 's future as regards Germany and Russia is now the particular theme The double peril impending over the island Empire is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempted to resent General Lea 's display of axioms , as also an apocalyptic tinge in the rhetoric , but gradually admiration grows at the tenaciousness and compactness of the argument ; irrespective , be it said , of its validity . In its way , the book recalls the stately and gloomy determinism of Machiavelli himself We are in a world , not of reasoning people , but of inconscient forces called nations , urged by elemental considerations of food supply , stress of population , scorn of weaker neighbors , desire for sun and seaports So tense and perilous a balance must from time to time be broken . Statecraft can not avert these periodical Armageddons . In fact , the whole duty of a statesman is military , to foresee these tests and meet them preparedly in his own time and on his own terms Such a ruler must be supported by a martial folk . Democracy and immigration are hostile to martial solidarity , and only the German and Russian Empires to-day , with the Japanese , can seriously be reckoned as military powers . All three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case expansion means conflict with England . She has put herself meanwhile in the poorest position to meet these inevitable clashes . When she failed Denmark in Schleswig-Holstein , she sacrificed in a day the prestige won at Trafalgar and Waterloo Here Gen. Lea echoes the contemporary verdict of Lord Salisbury , Who remarked that " to be despised by the minor states of Germany is , perhaps , the low est depth of degradation to which a great Power has ever sunk . " Since then England has kept her army stationary , while Russia , Germany , and Japan have stepped into the first rank Even on the sea Japan and Germany are pressing her . The Pacific has already passed irrevocably from her control . And the conflicts which were remote and potential a generation ago are now urgent . Russia , with her momentum towards India merely steadied and concentrated through the Manchurian rebuff , is quietly annexing Persia . Japan looks eagerly to Polynesia Germany chafes on every sea for colonies and coaling stations . ' Against these rivals , what can England interpose ? Merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every nation ultimately comes down to its power to weaken the enemy at home . Thus , if England should sink the German navy , England would be little the better off . Unable to follow up a naval success on land , the campaign would end in a stalemate most costly on the whole to the apparent winner . In short , a navy , except when two insular Powers are at war , is purely a subsidiary defensive arm , whereas an effective aggressive on land is ultimately the only real defence , all others being mere postponements It is true that without her present naval superiority , England would be exposed to quick subjection . With her preponderant navy , but without real expeditionary armies , she Merely offers herself to slower disintegration . Imagine the plight of Japan if the late war had ended without the Manchurian victories , and the case is clear . Bad diplomacy has since hastened what military neglect began Island Powers are natural rivals , and alliances between them unsound . England 's pact with Japan merely ousted herself from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case before us , England with China , and Japan with Russia , would have been the correct alignment . To meet the desperate plight in which she finds herself , England must first put herself on an expeditionary basis as regards Germany in Europe and Russia in Asia . This can only be done by Imperial consolidation with compulsory military service At the earliest instant England should seize and hold her true strategic lines , the Belgian-Holland frontier , and the Teheran-Herat line . Having issued his formal warning , Gen. Lea seems to doubt that it will be heeded . In fact , it would be an amazingly transformed Britain that should either make the necessary military preparations , or , having made them , begin war with ruthless forethought Are the days of the Saxon then . numbered ? How serious is this book ? Not necessarily , yet the book is serious enough . Its analysis of the limitations of sea power is admirable and most timely ; all the conflicts it foresees are easily within the realm of possibility . If national expansion is indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something like Gen. Lea 's apocalyptic vision may well take place within the lifetime of some readers of these words . Give him his axioms , and the rest follows . But these very axioms ignore important considerations . Japan , Russia , and Germany are treated as military constants . As a matter of fact , they are all exposed to social discontents that may eventually reduce their military efficiency . Nor is the postulated pressure of population a constant . There are indications that population will increase much more slowly in the future in all civilized nations . France in this regard may not be so much a decadent as a Prophetic state . Moreover , scientific agriculture will do much to relieve any distress from existing pressure of population . Nor is Gen. Lea 's contention that the mixed populations of nations fed by immigration are hopelessly unmilitary consonant with the facts . His ideal , thoroughbred , military power , indeed , has never existed , except on the small scale of Lacedmmon and Macedon . Finally , the possibilities of arbitration are not so negligible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all , replaced ordeal by ? combat . England and France , Argentina and Chili , by rational negotiation , have settled outstanding difficulties that more than once have threatened war . It is difficult to see that the conflicting aspirations of England and Germany necessarily defy peaceful adjudication . Theoretically , one may imagine purchases and readjustments that would satisfy the legitimate maritime aspirations of Germany without seriously weakening England . In fact , an overextended Power like England might actually gain by conversion of superfluous territory into cash . Russia did not hesitate to alienate for good reason a potential empire in Alaska . That such negotiations and sacrifices are difficult does not prove them impossible . We believe the time approaches when a sense of justice in nations will modify greatly those insensate instincts which Gen. Lea finds all-powerful . His general contention that England is far from prepared to hold her traditional world-prestige is unquestionably sound . It behooves her to arm , and more particularly with that political foresight that is the nerve of armies .

Essays on Questions Connected with the Old English Poem , of Beowulf . By Knut Stjerna . Translated and edited by John R. Clark Hall . Viking Club , Extra Series , Vol . III . London : Curtis &; Beamish . Several dissertations relating to archmological aspects of " Beowulf " have been published on the one side of the ocean or the other , but novice work of this kind can not weigh in the balance , of course , with the book that now lies before us  --  the production of one of the ablest authorities in the field of Scandinavian archeology , and Reader in that subject at Upsala for some years before he was snatched away by an untimely death in 1909 at the early age of thirty-five . There was no similar work in existence before , so that the present volume is undoubtedly a contribution of great value to the study of " Beowulf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publications between the years 1903 and 1908 ; they were consequently inaccessible to the great majority of the students of the Anglo-Saxon poem and such students will accordingly have reason to be grateful to Dr. Hall for undertaking the execution of the strongly cherished wish of the author that his papers relating to " Beowulf " should be collected and published in English . The writer 's conclusions will not , of course , always commend themselves to the acceptance of Anglo-Saxon scholars , but even in such cases the evidence which he has collected is of high interest , especially as the archeological material is set clearly before us in the copious illustrations  --  one hundred and twenty-eight in all  --  that adorn the book . As the editor remarks , this material is virtually exhaustive for the three Scandinavian countries during the period with which students of the Anglo-Saxon epic are concerned . Particularly good are the essays on " Swedes and Geats during the Migration Period , " " Scyld 's Funeral Obsequies , " " The Dragon 's Hoard , " and " Beowulf 's Funeral Obsequies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how Beowulf 's tribe , the Geats. took part in the great movement of the Germanic tribes to the south of Europe and how the consequent drain on its fighting strength and the introduction of southern culture led to the overthrow of the Geatic kingdom by the Swedes  --  the great event of the Migration Period for Scandinavia . By the plausible interpretation of the archeological evidence , Dr. Stjerna thus enables us to penetrate the darkness which has surrounded the history of the tribe to which the hero of the poem belonged . As Dr. Hall , however , remarks in the excellent introduction which summarizes the results of our author 's researches , 500 A. D. is too early a date for the downfall of the Geatic Kingdom . Indeed , in view of the well-attested historical fact that the Geat king of the first part Germanic tribes . The inconsistencies in the narrative of the Dragon 's hoard Dr. Stjerna interprets as due to a modification of the original lay in which the discovery of the hoard was a moor-find of treasure such as was not uncommon in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a later conception when such deposits were made ( in secrecy ) by individual men , but not wholesale by the tribe . Elsewhere regarding this episode our author makes the interesting comment that the hall where the treasure was hid , with its arched roof of stone resting on pillars , could not have belonged to the original Scandinavian lay , but must have been introduced by an Anglo-Saxon poet familiar with Roman architecture . In conclusion , we will say that the book confirms in the strongest manner the belief already so general , that " Beowulf " is of Scandinavian origin . It should seem that , in Dr. Stjerna 's opinion , the poem , as we have it , was worked up from Anglo-Saxon lays which were brought to England during the sixth century by the migrating tribes  --  these lays in turn being based on Scandinavian lays On the whole , this may be described as the view now most generally held in regard to the origin of the poem , but it seems incredible that every detail of Scandinavian saga and archmology should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmission , and the suspicion will not down that the English poet  --  for we may now assume a single authorship  --  was drawing directly from Scandinavian sources . Sonic German ' Women and their Salons . By Mary Hargrave New York : Brentano's. $2.75 net . Every book should ' have its raison cl-etre The justification of the present book lies , we suppose , in the attempt to sketch for the English reader the social status of certain cultured German women for about a half-century , say , from 1780 or 1790 to 1830 . The period was one of upheaval in every direction and in this upheaval women played their part To appreciate such influence is therefore right and proper in itself , success will depend , however , upon one 's qualifications Has our author the qualifications ? We doubt it . To begin with , the mere title of the book is misleading . " Their salons " implies that each of the women here represented had her salon Yet , in all frankness , not one of the so-called salons here sketched is a salon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that of Madame Rdcamier . We are not se rash as to undertake to define a salon . Only on the negative side will we venture to maintain that the genuine salon is characterized by the absence of two disagreeable qualities ? provincialism and didacticism . In the matter of provincialism , will any student of history assert that Berlin , even as late as 1830 , was not a provincial capital ? Vienna might have had a salon ; not Berlin . As for the didacticism , it crops out at every turn . Guests met in the reception rooms of Henriette Herz , Rahel Varnhagen , Bettina von Arnim , not solely for the glorious democratic give and take of esprits fasts ; quite as often as not they met ' ' to learn something . " Goethe 's mother fills fifty pages of the book . Yet her quiet , modest home in Frankfort bore not the slightest resemblance to a salon ; it was merely a pleasant , convenient meeting-place where the young might drop in for a friendly chat or a word of cheer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such a home . True , not every old lady can be a Frau Aja ; but the homelike atmosphere will be the same Then there is the Queen of Prussia , the famous Ken.igin . Luise . Shall we not say , once for all , that a queen , precisely because she is a queen , must have a court but can not possibly have a salon ? In fine , our author should have entitled her book " Some Notable German Women " and let it go at that . With the substance of the book it is not worth the while to quarrel , We question the author 's accuracy in German and French . Perhaps the printer is to blame for the marvellous word-breaking ( p 199 ) : " Bettina 's Fruhlingskranz " ! And for- Toeplitz , instead of Teplitz , p. 102 . But the long-suffering printer can scarcely be held responsible for " Briefwechsel zwischen Ilius Pamphilius and die Ambrosia . " How Goethe 's line , " Und das ist scion Gewinn des Lebens " came to be set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us a conundrum . Whether the author has gone very deeply into German literature , may be questioned The period which her book covers coincides  --  in the main  --  with the career of the Romantic School Now , this literary movement has been thoroughly studied and , we add , thoroughly discounted . Yet , though ephemeral and artificial , it seems to our author something spontaneous , vivifying . More remarkable Still , Goethe is represented as the idol of the school . This is exaggeration . Some of the school accepted Goethe , others did not . Anyhow , the full recognition of Goethe came later . As for Bettina and her " Brief wechsel , " we have long grown weary of them . Bettina was at best only the enfant terrible of her day , and her Brief weelisel is far more fiction than fact . In our opinion , the author would have done better , had she concentrated her efforts upon Rahel Varnhagen and Henriette Herz , the most influential literary characters of the period , but scarcely known in this country . Frau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noble Konigin Luise is a figure not in Ger man letters , but in German politics . The illustrations so-called are the ' most irritating feature of the book ; for they do-not illustrate ! Opposite the title-page is a medallion portrait of Rahel Tieck , yet the Tiecks nowhere-figure in the text , Henriette Herz 's beauty is mentioned frequently , but her portrait fails to convey a suggestion of beauty . Last , there is no portrait of Bettina ; instead we get the well-known sketch of Goethe on his death-bed , presumably because it appeared in Bettina 's " Tagebuch " ! This is picture-making run mad .
