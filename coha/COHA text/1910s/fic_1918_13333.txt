Time : A few years ago  --  six o'clock  --  an afternoon in April . Place : Grand Central Station  --  New York . The inside of a first-class sleeping car which is bound for the Pacific Coast . At Curtain : The only occupants are Mrs. Bay and her granddaughter Lily . Mrs. Bay is a little old lady , with white hair and a pink and white smiling face , wearing a quaint grey gown and bonnet . Her granddaughter Lily is a pretty girl of eighteen becomingly but provincially dressed for travelling  --  and just now is opening a suitcase and searching for something as she takes out various toilet articles . BAY , MRS . ( With the persistent voice of a deaf person ) I know it 's there for I put it in myself . I must have it to put over my bonnet . LILY Why did n't you put it on top , Grandma ? I ca n't find it . BAY , MRS . Put it on what ? LILY ( Raising her voice a little ) Top  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  yes . LILY ( Still louder ) Why did n't you  --  Oh  --  Here it is . ( Lily gives Mrs. Bay a grey cotton veil which Mrs. Bay carefully puts over her bonnet . A Red Cap Porter coming in from L. end of car carries a handsome travelling bag and umbrella and puts them in section at upper L. Mrs. Welch follows him into the car . She is a large woman , good looking in a common and flamboyant way  --  about forty-five years old , overdressed in the extreme height of the most extreme fashion . She carries a gold purse with vanity box and a great variety of trinkets which rattle noisily as she moves . After her enter Charles and Frank , two very young college boys who carry their own luggage , find their own section and proceed to make themselves comfortable  --  taking out caps to put on instead of their hats , unfolding newspapers , etc . Frank is quiet and shy with an appealing charm of manner . Charles is rather sure of himself and bears all the earmarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's goods. ) p. 3 WELCH , MRS . ( In a loud nasal voice ) Nine . Number nine mine is . I have the whole section . THE PORTER Yas 'm . WELCH , MRS . Which end is the ladies ' dressing room ? THE PORTER Right there , m'am . WELCH , MRS . ( Opening her purse ) Good Lord , it ought to be here . ( Seating herself with an air of ownership ) Now which way do we go ? THE PORTER ( Waiting for his tip ) This way , lady . WELCH , MRS . Oh Lord ! I 'll sit over here then . I ca n't ride backwards . Just leave my bag up on the seat . I have the whole section . ( Giving him his tip ) THE PORTER Yas 'm . ( The porter turns to go as Jim West comes in from the Left . He is a tall lanky fellow dressed in loosely fitting clothes and a soft hat . He carries a large shabby suitcase . He is about thirty-eight and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , humor , and great kindness . He moves with a long , slow stride  --  and glancing about the car , throws his suitcase into the seat on lower side at R. of the center section. ) p. 4 WEST Seven . Is this about it ? THE PORTER Yas sir  --  yas sir . WEST This car go all the way through to the coast ? THE PORTER Yas , sir . All the way through , sir . ( The Porter goes out , and Jim kicking his suitcase under the seat , starts out as a slender young woman shabbily dressed , enters . She carries a baby , a heavy satchel and a package which falls as the satchel strikes the end of the seat . ) ANNIE ( To the pullman porter who is helping her with her luggage ) The rest is out there . THE PORTER I 'll git it . I 'll git it . ( This porter is old and interested in his passengers . He shuffles out quickly . ) WEST ( Picking up the package ) Allow me madam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired voice ) Eight  --  upper eight . WEST ( Taking her satchel ) Here you are . Upper ? That 's bad business with the baby . Is n't it ? We 'll swop . You have my lower seven here  --  and I 'll take yours . p. 5 ANNIE Oh , no . I could n't put you to that trouble , mister . WEST Give me your berth ticket . Here 's mine . No , not that one . Here it is . ( Taking the right ticket from Annie ) Porter , we 're making a trade . The lady will have this one . THE PORTER ( Bringing in the rest of Annie 's luggage ) What sir ? ANNIE Oh no , I could n't take it off you . I could n't . WEST I prefer it up top . Better air . Great accommodation to me . ANNIE Oh my  --  is it ? Do you hear that , baby ? We do n't have to climb up after all . Thank you , sir . ( The porter deposits the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the covered basket in the rack . ) Oh do n't put that under there . I have to have it for the baby . THE PORTER You 'll have to put some of it under to make room . You ai n't got the whole section . ( He follows Jim West out . ) ( A dapper young Red Cap Porter brings a smart travelling bag and places it in the section in the center of the lower side . Women 's voices are heard and Kittie Van Dyke and Ethel Halstead come in from the left . Kittie is about thirty extremely smart  --  artificial  --  chic modern . She carries a box of violets and one of chocolates . Ethel is tall and languid  --  slow in speech and movement  --  wearing rather graceful clothes , soft and flowing in effect . She carries several books. ) p. 6 VAN DYCK ( In high quick tones ) Where is it ? Six she said , did n't she ? ETHEL ( Following slowly ) I do n't know . Heavens , is n't it stuffy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she would n't . She simply would not . ETHEL How could she ? I dare say it was all she could possibly manage to pay for her ticket . VAN DYCK Yes , I know . ( Stopping where the porter is standing ) Is this six ? THE PORTER Yes , miss . VAN DYCK I mean I wanted to blow her to it but she would n't have it . ETHEL Very sweet of you I 'm sure . ( Red Cap coughs slightly to remind the young lady of a possible tip . ) VAN DYCK Oh ! ( Looking at Ethel ) ETHEL I 'm sorry I have n't a cent . He 's waiting . VAN DYCK ( Looking at the porter ) Oh yes . Did n't the man give you anything ? p. 7 THE PORTER No , miss . VAN DYCK ( Winking at Ethel ) That 's graceful of him . Very Alfredesque . ( She gives the porter some money . He goes out . Kittie sits . ) As I was saying , I 'm so sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's kicked out . Literally kicked out . ETHEL ( Standing languidly and condescendingly in in the aisle ) Oh that 's putting it rather  --  VAN DYCK No , it is n't . What else can you call it when her old selfish aunt refuses to let her live with her any longer , and that pig of an Alfred Bemis has not come across and asked her to marry him ? ETHEL How could he ? Julie has n't a penny and Alfred about six thousand a year I suppose . VAN DYCK Six thousand a year with a real man would be  --  well  --  I 'd take a chance on it . In fact I 'd grab it . ETHEL It would n't pay for one third of your clothes . ( Finally deciding to sit opposite Kittie . ) VAN DYCK Oh slush  --  what do clothes mean after you 've got a man ? p. 8 ETHEL How you rave dear ! It 's delightful  --  when you spend more money on clothes than any woman I know . VAN DYCK ( Applying her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it  --  and have n't got anything else . But I 'd rather be in love than rich  --  any day . ETHEL Not Julie and Alfred . VAN DYCK Not Alfred . But let me tell you  --  he 's broken Julie 's heart . ETHEL Piffle ! Julie 's heart is too well regulated for that . VAN DYCK That 's where we 're all wrong about her . She 's proud and game and pulling it off awfully well  --  but she 's killed  --  simply killed and he 's a pig and I despise him  --  and when you think what she 's going to  --  it 's hell . That 's what it is . Nothing else . Why do n't they come in ? Alfred is making anmic love to her outside ,  --  I s'pose  --  keeping it up to the last . I 'm going to get them in . ( Kittie starts out as Julie Rutherford comes in followed by Alfred . Julie is beautiful , charming and exquisite , with an air at once appealing because of her loveliness and chilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself aloof as something more precious than common mortals . Alfred is pale , thin , perfect in manner and dress , the ruthless bachelor  --  comfortable on his small income , allowing himself the luxury of loving but not of marrying. ) p. 9 VAN DYCK Oh , here you are . I was just going out for you . Come and get settled . There 's only a minute . RUTHERFORD ( Coming to her section ) There 's plenty of time . ETHEL I hate coming into the train . Porter , do tell us when it 's time to get off . Why do n't you open some windows ? THE PORTER It will be cool enough when we get started , lady . RUTHERFORD Where am I ? Here ? ( Sitting in Ethel 's place as Ethel rises . ) VAN DYCK The drawing room 's taken , Julie . It 's absurd for you not to have it . RUTHERFORD For goodness ' sake , do n't fuss , Kittie . ETHEL But it 's awful  --  being mixed up with all kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bell violently . They all turn to look at her . ) WELCH , MRS . Porter , what time is it ? THE PORTER Seventeen minutes past . WELCH , MRS . Past what ? THE PORTER ( As he goes out at L. ) Past six . p. 10 WELCH , MRS . Oh ! ( She sets her diamond wrist watch . Julie and her friends exchange amused glances . ) ETHEL Here are some books , Julie dear . One of them will amuse you  --  the other is an awful bore but everybody 's reading it . VAN DYCK My little offering is chocolates . Mundane but most agreeable . ETHEL Here are some smelling-salts too . You need those more than anything else in a stuffy train . RUTHERFORD Thanks . You act as if I were going steerage . ETHEL You might as well . A train 's so much worse than a boat . You can get away from people a little on a boat . RUTHERFORD Let me take my violets out now . ( Opening the box and taking a deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ETHEL They wo n't last long in this air . ( The porter enters again carrying two huge travelling bags which he takes into the drawing room . A very partly gentleman by the name of Smith follows the Porter in . He carries a large roll of newspapers under his arm and puffs and blows as he wipes his face and the inside of his hat with his handkerchief which has a conspicuous colored border . Mr. Smith is about fifty and his fat puffy face is ill-natured and selfish . His clothes and his manners indicate that he has a great deal of money and very little else to recommend him. ) p. 11 SMITH , MR . ( As he waddles through the aisle ) This is good business  --  train so far from the gates a man nearly gets left . Turn on that fan in there . It 's hotter'n blazes . ( He disappears into the drawing room . ) VAN DYCK That pig has it instead of you . RUTHERFORD Thank goodness he 's going to be shut up in it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julie looking lovely ? I adore you when you 're a little pale , dearest . RUTHERFORD Are n't you trying some new rouge , my love ? VAN DYCK ( Opening her small mirror ) Yes . Do n't you think it 's good ? ETHEL It depends upon what you mean by good . ALFRED ( Leaning over the back of Julie 's seat ) If you want it to be as evident as possible I should say it was a great success . VAN DYCK You do n't suppose for one minute I want it to look natural I hope ? RUTHERFORD That would be stupid , would n't it ? It suits you awfully Kittie dear . You look adorably disreputable . I do n't know anyone who does it so well . p. 12 ETHEL Oh I do n't know  --  I think it 's much more chic to be glaringly natural  --  well groomed and bravely plain . After all that 's the last word in distinction . VAN DYCK Is n't it lucky you feel that way about it dearest ? WELCH , MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drawing room ) Say , Porter , are n't we going to start on time ? THE PORTER Yas 'm . Yas 'm . WELCH , MRS . Well it do n't look like it . ( Leo Stern comes in from the R. followed by a Red Cap Porter who carries a travelling salesman 's sample case . Leo himself carries a very large grip . ) STERN ( To the train porter who has just come out from Mr. Smith 's drawing room ) It 's a wonder you would n't be outside to help a fellow with his stuff . Where 's seven ? THE PORTER Right there sir . I was just a comin ' sir . STERN Excuse me , lady . ( Stopping at the seat where Annie is with the baby ) Upper seven is about mine . ANNIE Certainly . I do n't mean to take up all the room . p. 13 STERN ( Cheerfully ) All right  --  all right . Do n't move . Just so I have a place to put my feet . ( He takes off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing a large gold tooth . His cheaply fashionable clothes smack of his trade and his small wiry body has a certain slang in its movements . ) ETHEL Do go to bed early Julie and get away from it all . RUTHERFORD You speak as if there were some danger of my sitting on somebody 's knee before the evening 's over . VAN DYCK I wish you would . It would do you good . RUTHERFORD Heavens ! What 's that ? ( Sniffing as Mrs. Welch sprinkles toilet water about liberally and wetting her handkerchief , spreads it on the back of her seat . ) ETHEL Is n't it dreadful ? ( They all turn to look at Mrs. Welch as she waves her hands in the air to cool and dry them . ) RUTHERFORD My violets might as well die right now . ALFRED It 's time for us to get off . VAN DYCK It just kills me , Julie . I 'd rather anything had happened than this . p. 14 RUTHERFORD Good-bye Kittie dear . Good-bye , good-bye . ETHEL Do write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? It 's too awful to think of you  --  RUTHERFORD Oh do n't Ethel , dear  --  please . You 'd better get off now . The time 's almost  --  ( Ethel kisses Julie whose pride is fighting her emotion . ) VAN DYCK Go on Ethel . I 'm going to bawl and I ca n't help it and I do n't care . It 's a beastly rotten sin that you 're going . ( Throwing her arms about Julie  --  she cries . ) RUTHERFORD Do n't dear , it 's awfully sweet of you  --  but do n't  --  please . ( Ethel goes out . ) VAN DYCK Damn it ! It 's all wrong  --  you know . If I were a man I 'd snatch you up and make you stay . Good-bye  --  you 're a peach and I love you . ( Kittie rushes out wiping her eyes and bumping into Jim as he comes back . ) Oh Lord  --  ca n't people see me ! ( Jim smiles and goes on to his seat . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) This ca n't be the end for us , dearest . p. 15 RUTHERFORD It is . ALFRED No , I wo n't give you up . I ca n't . I ca n't . RUTHERFORD Oh do n't ! It 's all over . ALFRED Listen dearest . It is n't . Just because I 've got the beastly luck to have no money now does n't mean it will always  --  RUTHERFORD We 've been saying these things so long . ALFRED It 's money  --  only money . Nothing on earth would make me let you go if there  --  if I had enough to  --  to  --  RUTHERFORD To love me ? ALFRED Enough for us to marry . You  --  you surely do n't blame me for this separation  --  do you ? Oh my dear girl  --  you know I adore you . It 's only money that  --  RUTHERFORD It 's all money of course . Why do we pretend that anything else has anything to do with us ? ALFRED You know I love you . You know that  --  do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I loved you more this would n't have happened ? RUTHERFORD You know this could n't have happened if we cared for each other more than anything else in the world . p. 16 ALFRED But I do care for you more than for anything else in the world . You must believe me . RUTHERFORD More than for anything else except your own happiness . ALFRED You are my happiness . RUTHERFORD Oh no , your happiness is your comfort and your convenience . I would have been a very inconvenient incumbrance . ALFRED Take that back . Say you did n't mean it . RUTHERFORD I thought when I first knew I had to go  --  I was fool enough to think you would say " Stay and share what I have . " And I would have done it Alfred  --  and been contented to be poor  --  with you  --  if you had loved . If you had loved me . ALFRED Do n't . How can you say  --  RUTHERFORD I do n't blame you . You ca n't help it . Other things come first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How can I ? You 're being horribly cruel to me . It is n't true . And this is n't good-bye . RUTHERFORD Oh yes it is . ALFRED Kiss me . RUTHERFORD No. p. 17 ALFRED You must . ( " All Aboard "  --  is heard called outside . ) RUTHERFORD No , I ca n't . Go please . ALFRED Some day I 'll have you . I wo n't give you up . ( He kisses her hands and hurries out . The vestibule doors bang . Julie leans back covering her face  --  shaken by sobs which she is unable to control . ) BAY , MRS . I 'll be glad when we get through the river . It hurts my ears so . The concussion of air you know . It 's a marvelous thing though  --  marvelous . I did n't think when I was your age I 'd be riding right under a river in a railroad train . They 're doing wonderful things these days . If they just do n't go too far with their reckless ideas . LILY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What ? LILY Nothing . BAY , MRS . You jabber so I ca n't get half you say . WEST ( Looking out the window on the side towards the audience  --  then rising and leaning over the seat to speak to Julie ) Your friends are trying to attract your attention out there . p. 18 RUTHERFORD Oh , thank you . ( She turns to the window and raises her voice to speak to her friends outside . ) Yes  --  yes . No , I 'm all right . Do n't wait . Why do n't you go ? What ? Yes .  --  What ? Oh yes  --  I will . Good-bye  --  good-bye . ( Mrs. Welch rises to see to whom Julie is speaking . Lily and Mrs. Bay also look out  --  Annie tries to see  --  rising with the baby . Jim goes on reading . The change seen through the windows at back shows that the train is starting . The bell in the drawing room rings violently . ) STERN ( To Annie in loud and friendly tones ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Hello Kid ! ( To the baby  --  dangling his watch before her . ) Coo  --  coo ! Coo  --  coo ! Are you a boy ? ANNIE She 's a girl . STERN All look alike to me . ( The porter starts toward R. end as Mr. Smith opens the door of his room . ) SMITH , MR . What are you doing ? Why do n't you come when I ring ? Come here and turn off this fan . THE PORTER Yas sir . Yas sir . ( Smith goes in and the porter follows. ) p. 19 WELCH , MRS . ( Going down the aisle to the dressing room  --  blandly to Lily ) Rather a disagreeable old party  --  is n't he ? LILY ( Timidly ) Yes . BAY , MRS . What did the lady say ? LILY Nothing . WELCH , MRS . Is your grandmother deaf ? LILY Yes , a little . BAY , MRS . ( Sweetly to Mrs. Welch ) I do n't hear very well  --  the train makes such a noise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim opens a newspaper and buries himself in it . Julie , wiping her tears opens her smelling salts . ) CHARLES I wonder when we can get some food ? FRANK Dinner pretty soon I s'pose . CHARLES ( Nudging Frank and looking at Julie ) There 's a peach over there . Did you see the fellow saying good-bye to her ? She feels pretty rocky . FRANK What do you know about it ? I wish I did n't have to tell dad I flunked in two exams . He may not let me go back next year . p. 20 CHARLES Gee  --  I wish I did n't have to go back . But the more I flunk the longer they 'll keep on sending me . Look at Ikey and his gold tooth . ( As Leo rises and yawns  --  stretching his arms and looking about the car , Julie tries to open her bag and hurts her finger . ) STERN ( Going to Julie ) Allow me Lady . RUTHERFORD Oh , the porter will do it . STERN I 'll have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bag . ) No sooner said than done . RUTHERFORD ( Frigidly ) Thank you . STERN Do n't mention it . ( He strolls down the aisle to the boys . ) Smoker back this way  --  think ? CHARLES No  --  the other way . STERN Much obliged . ( Turning and going the other way ) CHARLES The pleasure is mine . ( To Frank ) I bet he sells pants ! STERN ( Stumbling and falling into Jim 's paper as he passes him ) Excuse me . Some spill . ( The passengers all show they suddenly feel the pressure in their ears as the train goes into the tunnel. ) p. 21 STERN ( To Annie ) Open your mouth and press your ears and it wo n't get you . ANNIE ( Looking about in distress  --  not understanding ) What 's the matter ? WEST Nothing . Nothing at all  --  sit still . BAY , MRS . There ! There ! What did I tell you ? I knew it would happen . It did before  --  that peculiar sensation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieves it . My  --  my  --  just think where we are and what 's on top of us ! What would we do if it caved in ? CHARLES ( Making a swimming motion and lowering his voice to Frank ) Swim , Grandma  --  swim ! ( Two conductors come in from the left , stopping first for Leo 's ticket . ) STERN ( Looking in all his pockets ) Hold on . I got ' em , somewhere . Would n't that jar you ! Where is the pesky thing ? Oh , here you are . ( Finding his tickets ) Right here . Upper five . How about a lower ? Could n't you fix me up ? They told me they did n't have anything but uppers . But that do n't go with me . How about it ? p. 22 SECOND CONDUCTOR ( Laconically ) All taken . STERN Oh , come off . Is that straight ? SECOND CONDUCTOR That 's what I said . STERN Well , fix me up , old man  --  if somebody do n't show up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes out . ) ANNIE ( To the conductor , as she gives him her ticket ) Will I be able to get this milk heated for the baby ? FIRST CONDUCTOR Speak to the porter about that . ANNIE Oh ! Thank you . I do n't have to change cars at all , do I ? FIRST CONDUCTOR This is a through sleeper . ANNIE Through ? FIRST CONDUCTOR You do n't change at all . ANNIE That 's what I thought . FIRST CONDUCTOR Tickets , madam . ( Julie rousing herself , opens her purse indifferently and then surprised , looks for her tickets . ) RUTHERFORD ( Having risen and turned over everything in the two seats several times ) Why , that 's funny . Where are they ? p. 23 SECOND CONDUCTOR Perhaps in your bag , lady . RUTHERFORD ( Opening her bag ) I surely did n't put them in it . No  --  not there . Why that 's too queer . I had my tickets and my berth ticket and my trunk checks all in one of those little railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FIRST CONDUCTOR Have you had them since you got on ? RUTHERFORD Why no  --  not since I came on  --  but they were poked at the gate  --  and of course I put them right back in my purse , again . Or at least I thought I did . FIRST CONDUCTOR You could n't have got through the gates without them . Take another look . SECOND CONDUCTOR Porter  --  help this lady look for her tickets . ( The conductors go on to the other passengers and the Porter who has just come in from the L. with paper bags for the hats , puts the bags in a seat and goes to Julie . ) FIRST CONDUCTOR ( To Grandma ) Tickets please . THE PORTER ( To Julie ) Lost your pocketbook , lady ? p. 24 RUTHERFORD No , my tickets . I have n't lost them but I ca n't find them . It 's the queerest thing I ever  --  Look under the seats please . THE PORTER Yas 'm . ( He gets down on his knees and looks under the seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BAY , MRS . Give him your tickets , Lily . Have you got both of them ? This is a long trip for an old lady like me . I say this is a long trip . I made it very comfortably two months ago , going to visit my daughter , and I guess I can do it going home . What is it ? ( As Lily nudges her to be quiet ) Are we on time ? ( The conductors nod again . ) That 's good . When I came East to visit my daughter  --  What is it , Lily ? Do stop stepping on my feet . THE PORTER ( Getting up from the floor ) No , mam  --  ' tai n't here . RUTHERFORD Take the cushions out . Maybe it 's fallen under . ( The porter lifts the cushions out of the two seats . The conductors take the boys ' tickets . ) CHARLES Fork out , Frankie . You 've got ' em . THE PORTER ( To Julie ) No .

Look well in that dark narrow place at the end . ( Pointing to the end of the car ) THE PORTER Yas 'm . Yas 'm . ( He gets down to look under Jim 's seat . Jim watches Julie as she mechanically goes through the same process of moving all her things again . She opens the violet box and turns it over . ) RUTHERFORD They must be here . WELCH , MRS . ( Giving the conductor her tickets as she comes back from the dressing room ) Lady lost her ticket ? FIRST CONDUCTOR Yes , madam . WELCH , MRS . Awful careless . I always carry my purse right on my arm like this . And when I go through a crowd I just hug it up to me like that . Too bad ! CHARLES ( To Frank ) Crawl down the aisle and look for the lady 's tickets , you lazy lubber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Charles goes to Julie. ) p. 26 CHARLES ( With irresistible good nature to which Julie responds ) Have you lost something ? RUTHERFORD Yes , my tickets . CHARLES Have you looked in all your books and papers ? RUTHERFORD Oh , I had n't thought of that . ( Charles helps Julie turn the leaves of her books and shake out her newspapers . ) You 're awfully good . It 's the most mysterious thing . If they had n't had to be poked at the gate I 'd think I had n't brought them . I do n't see  --  They were all together  --  my ticket  --  my berth check and my trunk checks  --  in one of those little railroad envelopes , you know . FRANK ( Going shyly to join Charles ) Where did you lose it ? RUTHERFORD That 's what I 'm trying to find out . CHARLES ( Digging Frank with his elbow ) That was a brilliant shot .

I left two valuable rings in there once and never did get them . One was a ruby  --  the most valuable ring I ever had , set in di'monds , you know . The other I did n't care so much for . I went right back the minute I missed them and they were gone . There was never any doubt in my mind who took them . ( Lowering her voice and glancing at the Porter ) It 's in the blood .

FIRST CONDUCTOR ( Going back to Julie ) Have n't you found it , Madam ? RUTHERFORD Not yet . FIRST CONDUCTOR I 'll be back in a little while . ( The conductors go into the drawing room . ) WELCH , MRS . ( Looking very accusingly at the porter ) Are you sure you did n't find it , Porter ? THE PORTER No ma'am . ' Tai n't in this car .

I do n't remember touching it  --  but I do know it was poked at the gate . SECOND CONDUCTOR Yes , but ca n't you remember  --  RUTHERFORD They were all together you know  --  my ticket , my berth check and my trunk checks  --  all in one of those little railroad envelopes . They were poked  --  punched out there . FIRST CONDUCTOR Yes but punching them out there wo n't do . I have to have a ticket or you 'll have to pay your fare . RUTHERFORD Oh , but you know I had a ticket . The man at the gate let me in so after all what difference does it make . SECOND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady . p. 32 RUTHERFORD Oh no  --  how could anyone ? I had it . You surely believe me , do n't you ? FIRST CONDUCTOR If you had it , madam , when you got on the train , where is it now ? RUTHERFORD That 's what I do n't know . FIRST CONDUCTOR That 's what we 've got to know . We have to have the ticket , madam . SECOND CONDUCTOR Too bad , lady . WEST ( Rising and leaning over Julie 's seat to speak to her ) Did one of your friends have the tickets at all ? RUTHERFORD Why yes , of course , Mr. Bemis had them . He was taking charge of everything . WEST He probably did n't give them back to you . RUTHERFORD That 's it . That 's just exactly the way it was . ( Looking at the conductors ) You understand , do n't you ? FIRST CONDUCTOR I have to have your ticket , madam , or you 'll have to pay your fare . ( Jim goes back to his paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station and get somebody to do something . p. 33 FIRST CONDUCTOR Producing the ticket is the only thing that will do any good . RUTHERFORD ( Not able to believe that her convenience is to be interfered with by law ) I 'll wire Mr. Bemis and ask if he has my ticket  --  and he will wire back  --  some place further on . That 's all that 's necessary , surely . CHARLES Or you could tell him to have the ticket office telegraph you it was O.K. That would be official all right , would n't it ? FIRST CONDUCTOR All that takes time . You can pay your fare and it will be returned to you if the ticket is found . See ? RUTHERFORD Oh but I  --  I 'm afraid I could n't do that . SECOND CONDUCTOR Where was the ticket to , Lady ? RUTHERFORD Greenville , Montana . WELCH , MRS . Good Lord !

RUTHERFORD Oh , but  --  p. 34 FIRST CONDUCTOR That 's the only thing I can do . RUTHERFORD ( Opening her purse helplessly ) But I  --  I  --  I do n't happen to have that  --  that amount with me . I  --  I can give you twenty-five dollars . That would make it all right , would n't it . Till I get my ticket ? I 'll telegraph at the  --  FIRST CONDUCTOR I 'm sorry , Madam , but I ca n't let passengers ride on my train without their fare . That 's what I 'm here for . RUTHERFORD But I have n't enough money with me , do n't you see ? WELCH , MRS . ( Calling from her seat ) Give him a check ? FIRST CONDUCTOR We do n't take checks . You 'll have to get off at the next stop . WEST Pardon me . To Greenville , Montana , you say you 're going ? RUTHERFORD Yes . WEST I 'm going within a hundred miles or so of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ticket and you can fix it up when you get there . RUTHERFORD Oh , I could n't let you do that . FIRST CONDUCTOR Then I 'm sorry , Madam , but you 'll have to get off at the next stop . ( The conductors go out. ) p. 35 RUTHERFORD ( To Jim ) Thank you very , very much . You 're extremely kind , but I could n't . WEST I thought perhaps you 'd like to go on with your journey now that you 've started . I suppose you can get a train back to New York tonight . RUTHERFORD I suppose so . Thank you . ( Jim goes back to his seat and Julie sits staring desperately before her , breathing quickly . The other passengers watch for a moment and then go on with their own affairs . ) CHARLES Damned shame for her to have to get off . She 's a peacherino . FRANK The conductor could n't help it . She ought to take that fellow 's money . WELCH , MRS . ( Going back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What are you going to do  --  get off ? RUTHERFORD I suppose so . WELCH , MRS .

It 's nothing more than my duty . But my ! It certainly is a dose . Nothing like New York , is there ? I could n't live any place else . When you 're in right New York 's the place . Have n't I seen you somewhere before ? p. 36 RUTHERFORD I do n't think so . WELCH , MRS . Seems to me I have . Did you ever come to the Queen of Hearts Bridge Club ? RUTHERFORD No  --  I never did .

ANNIE What ? WELCH , MRS . ( Glancing at Annie ) I guess she has n't travelled much . THE PORTER A bag for your hat to keep the dust off . ANNIE Oh , thank you . ( The Porter takes Annie 's hat from the rack and puts it into the bag . ) WELCH , MRS . All kinds of people in this world , are n't there ? ( With the amused air of an experienced traveller. ) p. 37 RUTHERFORD Yes , there seem to be . THE PORTER Have your hats in a bag , ladies ? ( Julie shakes her head . ) WELCH , MRS . Take mine over there . Be careful how you put it in , too . THE PORTER Yas 'm . RUTHERFORD How soon do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten minutes now , ma'am . RUTHERFORD Do you know when the first train goes back to New York ? THE PORTER I could n't say , Lady . I expects there 'll be one along about midnight . ( He goes to put Mrs. Welch 's hat in a bag . ) WELCH , MRS . It 'll be awful waiting , wo n't it ? You might go to a movie to kill time . That 's what I 'd do . Oh , that coon 's jamming my hat in like a rag . Here ! Be careful ! I paid a hundred dollars for that hat . ( She takes the hat away from the porter and puts it into the bag herself . The porter gives two bags to Lily and she and Mrs. Bay go through the process of putting their hats in . ) BAY , MRS . More of their modern inventions . I approve of this one . It 's very sensible . Do n't you think we 'd better eat our supper now ? p. 38 LILY ( Glancing at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we had . I want to get to bed early and get settled for the night .

LILY I do n't want to eat with those boys right there . BAY , MRS . Why not ? LILY Oh , I do n't know . It looks so . BAY , MRS . That 's no reason . I do n't want to get a headache . Open the box . LILY Oh , Grandma ! ( Lily takes the shoe-box and opens it reluctantly . ) BAY , MRS . Do n't get a spot on that good skirt of yours . Fried chicken 's awfully greasy .

( Charles and Frank both stoop to get the orange  --  but it rolls further under the seat and Frank goes down on his knees to get it . ) CHARLES What are you doing ? Why do n't you get it ? FRANK ( Feeling for it ) Must have been oiled . ( He gets lower down to look under the seat . ) CHARLES Are you eating it ? BAY , MRS . Dear , dear ! That 's too bad  --  to give the young man so much trouble .

We have another one and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FRANK No , thank you . BAY , MRS . I wish you would . LILY Oh , Grandma !

( Eating her fried chicken with great relish and cracking an egg on the arm of the seat ) What 's the matter ? Take your chicken , child . It 's very nice . ( Lily eats a piece of bread and butter  --  keeping her back to the boys . Julie again looks in her bag and her purse and shakes out the books and papers , occasionally wiping her eyes . ) CHARLES Me for food . Come on Frank . FRANK Are you blowing me to it ? CHARLES I 'll match you for it . ( Charles follows Frank out with his hands on Frank 's shoulders , pushing him along . ) WELCH , MRS .

ANNIE You can when you have to . WELCH , MRS . Why do n't you put it in short clothes ? ANNIE I do n't just happen to have any . WELCH , MRS . You ought to get some . Hello baby . See it look at me . Kind a ' cute . Bye , bye , Cutie . ( She goes out . Annie rocks the baby in her arms , singing softly . ) THE PORTER ( Following the conductor in ) All right , Lady .

LILY ( To her grandmother ) Oh , I think that 's awful ! She 's going . ( Julie rises and goes slowly to the door  --  Jim watches her . She turns suddenly and goes back to him. ) p. 42 RUTHERFORD I  --  I think I will let you , if you  --  if you 'll be so good . WEST You 'll go on ? RUTHERFORD I ca n't get off . I ca n't . If you 'll be good enough to lend me the money , I shall be very much  --  WEST Of course . THE PORTER ( Coming back ) This way out , Lady . WEST She 's not getting off . Tell the conductor to come here . THE PORTER Them was his orders , sir . The lady is to get off . WEST Tell him to come here . THE PORTER We only stops a minute . You 'll have to hurry , Lady .

You 're very very kind to do this . ( The train stops . There is the sound of newsboys calling outside. ) p. 43 WEST Not at all . I just happened to have the money with me . Why should n't it be used ? That 's what it 's for . FIRST CONDUCTOR ( Hurrying in ) Madam , I told you you 'd have to  --  WEST Hold on . This lady has decided to let me lend her the money . How much did you say the fare is ? FIRST CONDUCTOR Ninety-two dollars and fifty cents . WEST ( Counting the bills ) Twenty , forty , sixty , ninety-two and a half . There you are . FIRST CONDUCTOR Here 's your receipt .

Somebody usually helps us out . RUTHERFORD If you 'll give me your name and address , please . And this is mine . ( Taking a card from her purse ) Or at least it was . That was my New York address . I 'll write the other . p. 44 WEST I have n't got a card . RUTHERFORD Just put it on one of mine , then , please . ( As he gives the card back to her ) Thank you . My brother will send the  --  the amount as  --  a  --  just as soon as possible  --  of course  --  and he will be extremely indebted to you for your kindness .

WEST No  --  fifty miles from a town . RUTHERFORD But will a letter  --  WEST Oh yes , they throw the mail bag off to us . RUTHERFORD And it 's only a camp ? WEST We call it a camp . We 've got about forty log houses and a store and a kind of a shed where the trains stop long enough for things to get off . And a good many things do get off  --  from pretty much all parts of the country . It 's , you might say , as cosmopolitan a mixture of human beings as you can find put together anywhere .

What sort of a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come when he 's down and out and stay till he gets on his feet again , if he 's willing to fall in with the law . RUTHERFORD The law ? ( A little interested in spite of herself . ) WEST The law is work . Work and get your living out of the earth . RUTHERFORD How extraordinary ! WEST Oh , no  --  it 's ordinary enough . You do n't happen to have stumbled on to it . We 're all so busy digging in our own potato patches we do n't see much of the other fellow 's . RUTHERFORD And that 's where we ought to stay  --  in our own . WEST ( Trying to put her at ease , his kindness covering his shyness . He speaks with a whimsical smile and a wistful hesitancy . ) Do n't you think it 's  --  good  --  for us to be jerked out of them once in a while ? RUTHERFORD No  --  I do n't think that .

RUTHERFORD Just that . It insures you against any possible loss  --  in case anything should go wrong . WEST I am insured . RUTHERFORD What ? WEST I 've got all the security I want . RUTHERFORD You have n't any . You must take  --  WEST You said you 'd send the money as soon as you could  --  did n't you ? RUTHERFORD Yes , but that 's nothing after all . You do n't know who I am or what might happen and this makes it safe . WEST ( Taking the pin and looking at it ) The pin is worth a good deal more than the price of the ticket  --  is n't it ? RUTHERFORD Of course . p. 47 WEST And how do you know I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because  --  you would . WEST How do you know ? RUTHERFORD Just because  --  I know . WEST Then you must give me credit for as much good judgment as you evidently think you have yourself . It 's my gamble . I 'll wait . If I lose the money it 's my own fault . ( Laying the pin on her book . ) RUTHERFORD Please take it . WEST No thank you . I want to see how good a guess I 've made . I have n't been fooled many times . It would take all the fun out of it to have any sort of security . RUTHERFORD I 'm afraid I do n't see any fun in this situation . WEST Oh I  --  did n't exactly mean that . RUTHERFORD Just what  --  did  --  you mean then ? WEST Well  --  to see a pesky little ninety-two fifty help a  --  somebody like you out of a  --  a  --  hole  --  was  --  I mean it was the biggest chance of doing something agreeable that I 've had in a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put it that way . The " pesky little ninety-two fifty "  --  may not be very large to you  --  but it means a very great deal to me . It saved me from something hideous and humiliating , and I appreciate it more than I can possibly tell you . WEST Then I 'm lucky . Ever been West ? RUTHERFORD No . WEST You 'll like it  --  if you do n't go with your mind made up not to . But I 'm afraid that 's what you have done . RUTHERFORD No , I have n't , but I do n't belong there . WEST We belong everywhere  --  do n't we ? RUTHERFORD Oh no , we do n't . We all have our own places and ca n't be pulled up by the roots and live . WEST Do n't you think we 're all on one root and can live any place if we will ? RUTHERFORD No , I do n't . WEST I think we can . RUTHERFORD That 's a beautiful theory but facts ca n't be changed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts . Most everything we 're afraid of is only a boog-a-boo that can be changed with a good jerk . p. 49 RUTHERFORD I do n't like jerks . WEST Oh , they 're fine . I know because I was pulled out of one thing and landed in the last place on earth I ever expected to be  --  and it 's much bigger living than trotting along in the harness I was born in . There 's nothing like a good hit in the head to make us see stars we did n't know were in the firmament . RUTHERFORD I do n't agree with anything you say  --  but I wish I did . WEST ( After a short quick laugh ) We never agree to anything till we 've lived through it , then we know .

I have n't had anything today but an apple . If you would n't mind just keeping your eye on her in case she rolls off . RUTHERFORD Where are you going ?

RUTHERFORD What would I do if she did ? ANNIE Just pick her up again . RUTHERFORD But are n't you afraid to leave it ? ANNIE Not if you watch ' er , Miss . If you 'd be so good as to .

Jim from behind his paper watches her with the keenest amusement and interest . The baby begins to whimper a little , rapidly increases till it howls lustily . Julie in consternation stands up. ) p. 51 RUTHERFORD Oh , what 's the matter ? Do n't , baby ! There  --  there ! ( Patting it timidly ) Do n't cry . There , there ! Oh goodness ! What is the matter ? What shall I do ? Will you go and get the mother ? WEST Too bad to haul her back before she gets anything to eat .

What is the matter ? Your mother 's coming back in a few minutes . Oh , please do n't cry so . What shall I do ? WEST You 're doing pretty well seems to me . RUTHERFORD But I may be doing the wrong thing . WEST The longer you stick it out the more the mother can eat . RUTHERFORD How can anything so little make so much noise ? There ! There ! You poor little thing . That 's better . Why you 're actually sort of pretty . What tiny hands ! Oh , do n't cry again . There ! That 's right ! You must be good and wait for mother . That 's a good baby . ( Wiping the baby 's eyes with her own handkerchief . ) Do you think I could put her down again now ? p. 52 WEST I think you 'd be taking big chances .

At Curtain : Mrs. Welch 's section is partially made up , but the curtains not hung . Leo is entertaining Annie and Mrs. Welch is with Mrs. Bay . There is a general air of intimacy and friendliness . The other pasengers are not in the car . WELCH , MRS . ( Shouting to Mrs. Bay and elaborately polishing her fingernails ) She 's eating dinner with him now and I dare say he 's paying the bill .

( He struts down the aisle and out. ) p. 61 THE PORTER Yas , sir . Yas , sir . ( Going out after Smith ) WELCH , MRS . Um ! Nothing like thinking of yourself . STERN ( To the boys ) If you want to see the golden rule shining at its brightest , watch the travelling pub . Not safety first  --  but me first . ( Julie comes in from the diner . Leo starts towards her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) STERN ( Catching Julie ) Going some ! Pardon me . Did I grab you too tight ? I thought you was going over . RUTHERFORD ( Drawing her arm away ) It 's all right . Thank you . ( Julie does n't look at Leo as she sits but he stands by her contentedly . ) STERN I 've got a good book down there . One that 'll keep you guessing . Like to have it ? RUTHERFORD Thank you . I have books . STERN I never read except when I 'm on the train and then I like something doing . Want your window down ? Allow me . ( Julie starts and puts her hand over one eye quickly . ) Got a cinder in your eye ? p. 62 RUTHERFORD It 's nothing . STERN Must be something to make you jump like that . Hurts like the mischief , do n't it ? RUTHERFORD It will be all right in a minute . STERN No it wo n't . Oh , that blowing the other side of your nose do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cinder out is to take it out . I 'll do it for you . RUTHERFORD Oh no . STERN Very glad to . RUTHERFORD Oh no  --  no . It will be all  --  STERN No it wo n't . I know the trick . You must n't monkey with a cinder . Quick action is the thing . Just hold your head back and keep still a minute . RUTHERFORD No , I do n't want  --  STERN I wo n't hurt you . Give me your hankie . Now , I just turn the lid back like that and  --  Hold still  --  just a  --  Hold still  --  There you are . No wonder you squirmed . That was a whale of a fellow . ( Showing the cinder to Jim . ) How 's that for size , to get in a lady 's eye ? ( Jim has come in from the dining car in time to see the cinder extracted , and now as Julie looks at him they laugh in a very friendly and understanding way. ) p. 63 RUTHERFORD I 'm very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention it . Do n't rub it now . ( To Jim ) Had your dinner ? WEST Yes . STERN Pretty bum layout . Gettin ' to the bottom . Try the chicken ? WEST I know better . STERN I got stung for a dollar twenty-five for the toughest old bird in captivity last night . I 'll be damned glad when I get out of this . That 's the worst thing about my business  --  sittin ' still in a train  --  no action . Ca n't sell no goods  --  just have to wait . It 's hell . WEST Why do you do it ? STERN Why do I do it ? So 's I can live when I get back to Broadway . See ? I 'm going to take a chance on a little food now myself . You 're not the only one who 's playing a twosome . I 've got a date myself in the diner . ( Winking and smiling intimately at Jim he goes out . ) WEST I hope that first aid to the injured was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WEST But you did n't look grateful . p. 64 RUTHERFORD I was n't . Oh , you were going to tell me  --  WEST Wait till these people go out to dinner . RUTHERFORD Is n't it a bore ! ( Mrs. Welch , having heard this conversation , raises her eyebrows and deliberately marches down to Julie . ) WELCH , MRS . Poor food , is n't it ? RUTHERFORD Pardon me ? WELCH , MRS . I say it 's awful poor food . Are n't you getting sick of it ? RUTHERFORD I suppose we ca n't expect anything else . WELCH , MRS . Oh I do n't know . Lord knows we pay enough for it . That 's one thing I 'm awfully fussy about . ( Sitting opposite Julie ) I pay my cook eighty dollars and I never go near the kitchen . That 's one thing my husband will have  --  good food . Prices are fierce though  --  are n't they ? RUTHERFORD I believe so . WELCH , MRS . But I say to Harry " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dead as have nothing you like to eat . " We go out a lot too . When I entertain friends I like to take them down-town , do n't you know . I think they like it better . What 's your favorite place ? p. 65 RUTHERFORD Oh  --  they 're all dull enough . WELCH , MRS . Oh I do n't know . Not if you are n't a dead one yourself . You have to know the ropes of course and where to go , and that 's one thing I do know  --  I know New York and what 's going on in it . Here 's this old lady over here talking about her town  --  her church  --  her friends  --  thinking the sun rises and sets right there . Funny ai n't it ? Just laughable when you do live in the real world . RUTHERFORD ( Taking up her book ) Yes , I suppose so . WELCH , MRS . You 've got real friendly with the fellow who loaned you the money by this time  --  have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . Why not ? I 'm broad minded . I believe in taking all that comes your way  --  within reason . RUTHERFORD I really do n't know what you mean . WELCH , MRS . Oh , I do n't mean anything . I think you were darned sensible to do it and of course you have to be friendly to him since you did do it . It 's caused some talk  --  but then that do n't matter to me . I 'm not so straight-laced. p. 66 RUTHERFORD Talk ? How absolutely disgusting . WELCH , MRS . Well you know you ca n't keep people from having their opinions and saying what they please . Nobody 's got a little wire fence around ' em in this day and age . It do n't go . I 'm going to eat . ( Speaking to Jim as she passes him ) You went in pretty early tonight , did n't you ? ( She smiles at Jim and goes out slowly  --  humming insinuatingly as she goes . ) WEST ( Rising to get Annie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't let our youngest passenger fall . She would n't like it . ANNIE I guess not . If anything happened to her  --  Thank you . If anything happened to her I might as well never try to get to Bill at all . WEST I guess Bill would be pretty glad to see you anyway  --  would n't he ? ANNIE ( With a long hopeless sigh ) I would n't risk it without her . WEST Is there anything I can do to make things easier for you ? Because if there is  --  speak up . Do n't be foolish about thinking I 'm a stranger or anything of that kind . Understand ? p. 67 ANNIE You do n't seem like a stranger somehow . WEST I 'm not . There 's no such animal . Is there something I can do ? ANNIE No  --  there ai n't . There 's nothin ' nobody can do . I 've just got to get to Bill . ( Touching her chest with a tired hand ) Somehow I do n't feel as if I was ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along in fine shape , putting you nearer every minute . ANNIE Yes , but that ai n't it . I just have a feelin '  --  I want to speak to that lady . ( She crosses to Julie  --  taking the baby with her . ) May I speak to you a minute ? ( Jim goes out . ) RUTHERFORD ( Moving some things on the seat opposite her ) Sit down . ANNIE Thank you . I just want to thank you for mindin ' her every day while I went out to eat . RUTHERFORD Oh , please do n't . ANNIE You 've been awful good . RUTHERFORD Nonsense ! I liked it . I really believe she knows me now . p. 68 ANNIE Of course she does . She  --  she 's an awful good baby . RUTHERFORD Indeed she is . With very wonderful manners and a most engaging smile . Are n't you , baby ? ANNIE I mean she 's healthy , an ' I 've always kep ' ' er clean . I 've always managed to do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that 's so important . Is n't it ? ANNIE Yes  --  but it 's hard . It costs an awful lot to be clean . RUTHERFORD Oh  --  yes , I suppose it does . ( Leaning over the baby ) Baby , you 've got the cunningest , most tinsy-weeny  --  adorable nose I ever saw in my life . Oh see  --  see how she curls her fingers around mine . Look ! Is n't that too sweet ! ANNIE Un-hun . RUTHERFORD See  --  she wo n't let go . Think of there being any strength in those delicate little things . Hello , baby . You 've had a beautiful nap  --  yes you have  --  and your cheeks are like roses . You are wonderful  --  you blessed little  --  little thing . Do you know I 've never really known a baby before . They are marvelous . ANNIE Do you like her ? p. 69 RUTHERFORD Of course . ANNIE What I wanted to say to you was  --  you do n't happen to know anybody wants a baby , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . There 's a lot of it done , you know . Lots of people  --  rich people  --  is awful glad to get babies without going through the trouble of havin ' ' em . An ' it is a trouble , God knows . I used to be awful strong . I did , honest . She 's strong and healthy . Nobody do n't need to be afraid of that miss . You believe me , do n't you ? RUTHERFORD But  --  you do n't want to give up your own baby . ANNIE No . I do n't want to . But somehow I kind a feel as if it might be better . I kind a have a feelin ' I ai n't going to last long . RUTHERFORD Oh , do n't say that . ANNIE An ' I  --  I  --  ai n't so sure about Bill nohow . RUTHERFORD Are n't you ? ANNIE I kind a ' thought some of your swell friends might like her . RUTHERFORD My " swell friends " are a thing of the past  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 ANNIE Or I kind a ' thought maybe you might like her yourself  --  seeing you took such a likin ' to her  --  or you 'd know somebody . Do n't you , Miss ? Honest , Miss , I mean it . RUTHERFORD There is n't a single being in the whole world I could ask to help you or one tiny little thing I could do for you myself . ANNIE Oh  --  ( Looking at Julie like a hurt dog and lowering her head ) Oh , I thought a lady like you could do anything  --  if she wanted to . RUTHERFORD " A lady like me " is a very helpless thing and more unhappy than you . You have your baby and you 're going to Bill . I 'm going to people who do n't want me , and when I get to the end of my journey I 'll have about ten dollars left in my pocketbook  --  a few clothes in their last stages  --  and that 's all . And my ticket must be paid for  --  somehow  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  ai n't it ? RUTHERFORD I 'm telling you so you wo n't think me a beast . I 'm sorry but  --  you  --  you 'll be all right  --  when you get to your husband . ANNIE I 'm sorry for you , lady . You look like you ought to be awful happy . p. 71 RUTHERFORD Yes , I think myself I ought to be  --  but I 'm not . You  --  you 'll never be alone  --  and quite unhappy  --  with her  --  will you ? ANNIE If I was only sure I could last long enough to pull her through till she 's a big girl  --  that 's all . RUTHERFORD But you will . You must . ANNIE ( Touching her chest ) It 's here . I 'm all gone here somehow . RUTHERFORD I  --  wish there was  --  something I could do . ANNIE Thank you , Miss . ( Annie goes back to her seat with the baby . Julie sits absorbed in her thoughts . Jim enters , going to his seat . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supper . BAY , MRS . All right . I 'm ready . But we must n't eat as much as we did last night . It costs entirely too much . We could have got along without that poor soup just as well as not . CHARLES Come on , Frank . ( To Lily ) We can all sit at the same table . BAY , MRS . Are the young men coming too ? That 's nice . Come along . I like young people . p. 72 FRANK ( Taking Mrs. Bay by the arm ) Be careful . She 's hitting it up pretty high just now . LILY Oh , do n't tell her that . BAY , MRS . What ? FRANK ( Very loudly to Mrs. Bay ) It 's a nice evening . ( Lily goes out after Frank and Mrs. Bay . Julie rises and walks restlessly to the end of the car . Charles turns and goes back to Julie . ) CHARLES Here 's the book you gave Lily . I read it too . I hope you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it ? CHARLES Y-e-s . RUTHERFORD Oh , was it as bad as that ? CHARLES I spent most of the time wondering why you like it . RUTHERFORD Then it was n't a success . CHARLES Oh yes it was , only I 'm not exactly " on . " RUTHERFORD Do n't try to put so much into it . It 's only nice nonsense . CHARLES Will you let me come and ask you about it , after dinner ? p. 73 RUTHERFORD I 'll let you come and tell me about it . CHARLES Do n't think I 'm fresh , but the girl in it seems  --  just like you . RUTHERFORD Goodness ! Why ? CHARLES That 's what I 'd like to talk about . RUTHERFORD This is going to be very interesting . CHARLES It will be for me . ( He beams on her with shy adoration and goes out . ) RUTHERFORD ( Going to lean over Annie 's seat ) Wo n't you go to your dinner now while the baby 's so quiet ? ANNIE I would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You sure have been good doin ' it . I do n't know how I could a ' got on without you . ( Annie goes out . ) WEST Are n't you going to miss this new habit of yours  --  minding the baby ? RUTHERFORD ( Going to Jim 's section and sitting opposite him ) It 's too bad you have n't a place for mothers and babies in your camp . That poor woman seems rather desperate . p. 74 WEST I 'm going to have  --  a baby farm some day . When you catch the kiddies young enough you can bring up a fine crop . That 's really better than making them over after they 're grown up . You 've struck my hobby now . RUTHERFORD Really ? Then maybe you could take this baby . WEST Wish I could . Nothing 's ready yet . RUTHERFORD She does n't seem to be any too sure that her husband wants her . WEST Bill , you mean . RUTHERFORD Yes . WEST I do n't think Bill is a husband  --  at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that ? WEST Just a hunch . RUTHERFORD Poor thing . Poor thing . ( A long pause ) Have n't you anything to amuse you out there in your camp ? It must be horribly desolate with just men . WEST Not on your life . Turn a lot of men loose together out in the open and they 're boys again . It 's only when I get back where women are that I miss ' em . That 's when a fellow 's lonely  --  in a crowd  --  women to left of you , women to right of you , and none of ' em yours . They seemed prettier than ever in New York this time  --  and further away . p. 75 RUTHERFORD And do n't you know any ? WEST Not one . Not since the one . She hung on as long as she could while I was drinking myself into a beast and then  --  it all snapped . That was the jolt that sent me out there . That 's how the camp happened  --  and the trying to pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And  --  are you satisfied with that ? WEST While I 'm at it with my teeth in it hard I am . It 's only when I come back that I want something more . RUTHERFORD Does n't she know now what you 've done ? WEST No . RUTHERFORD Why do n't you let her know ? WEST What 's the use ? Too late . Married I s'pose . RUTHERFORD And is n't there anything to look forward to  --  but just your work out there ? WEST Nothing . That 's enough . It grows like blazes . RUTHERFORD But how do you  --  the money  --  I do n't see how  --  WEST Oh , money 's the easiest part of it . I just took a fellow back home now . That 's what brought me East  --  a fellow that 's been out there six months and got back the decency that was pretty nearly gone . I took him home to a heartbroken woman and they 're both so grateful  --  that they 've given me a big boost with money for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , I 've got great schemes for the future . It 's a live wire all right . p. 76 RUTHERFORD Oh , but it 's so far away from everything  --  the real world . WEST The real world is life  --  and the same life runs through us all . RUTHERFORD Oh , nonsense ! WEST Real life  --  with all the layers of luxury and class ripped off  --  down to the bone . It takes a lot of living to know that . RUTHERFORD If you 're trying to tell me that what I 'm going through will make me over into something better you never were so mistaken in your life . Why pretend I can be good and noble just because I 'm unhappy ? Everything in the world I 've lived with and for is gone . The aunt who took me when I was a little girl and lavished everything that was beautiful and exquisite on me  --  has suddenly lost her money and turned me off . There 's not a single spot on earth where I can go  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's a doctor and has seven children and a wife I 've never seen and she 'll hate me and I 'll hate her  --  and it 's all disgusting and sordid and no ideas nor ideals can change it . You might as well take a fish out of the sea and tell him he can live just as well on the land  --  and that it 's his fault if he doesn't. p. 77 WEST You and the fish are a little different . If civilization does produce a higher breed its highness is only tested and proven by the way it lives when life is hardest . If you 're going to let unhappiness smash you  --  then you 're not the high product you think you are . You do n't think I 'm horribly impertinent , do you ? RUTHERFORD No . What difference does it make ? We 'll never see each other again . ( Rising and going back to her own section and then suddenly letting herself speak with an intimacy and warm charm which she has not allowed herself before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  in these three days than I 've ever talked in my life . WEST Of course  --  because all the silly little stickers of convention were knocked in the head when you lost your ticket and you had to take help from somebody . RUTHERFORD You make me out an awful prig . WEST Well you are  --  are n't you ? RUTHERFORD ( Laughing a little ) I suppose so . Oh  --  this flying along through space  --  shut up tight with a few people  --  is a funny thing , is n't it ? p. 78 WEST ( Going to her section to sit ) I like it . It 's got a sort of getting together feeling about it . The outside world stops . RUTHERFORD Yes . I used to hate it but I 've been thinking all day how much easier it would be to keep on going  --  then to stop tomorrow night . WEST And you could keep on minding the baby . RUTHERFORD She 's so sweet . She knows me now . WEST And I could keep on talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spilled it all out . RUTHERFORD So have I. WEST Oh , no , you have n't . RUTHERFORD A lot anyway . WEST I have n't talked to a woman like you since  --  well  --  RUTHERFORD You 're a strange person  --  are n't you ? WEST Not a bit . RUTHERFORD You seem to have all the nice things that  --  that  --  a  --  you know . WEST You mean I do n't eat with my knife ? p. 79 RUTHERFORD Yes  --  and yet you seem to be utterly and absolutely free from every convention on earth . WEST You could be too . RUTHERFORD Never . WEST Oh , yes . And you 'll never draw a long full breath and get all the air that 's coming to you till you are free . RUTHERFORD What do you mean ? ( They are leaning toward each other  --  drawn by a strong mutual attraction and giving way with a certain abandon . ) WEST Outside things make you and control you . Even here  --  sitting here alone  --  cut off from everything  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  not really approving of yourself because you 're talking to me  --  RUTHERFORD Oh  --  WEST You 're tied up by thousands of outside things  --  and your real self  --  has never been let loose at all . RUTHERFORD I 'm not tied up . I 'm  --  I 'm  --  protected by tradition  --  if that 's what you mean . WEST That 's the polite way of saying you 're frozen by a lot of damned nonsense . p. 80 RUTHERFORD Good manners and good form are only the result of good sense . Because I observe them does n't mean that my mind is n't free . WEST You do n't know what freedom means . RUTHERFORD Nonsense ! Of course I do . WEST No , you do n't . I 'm talking to you because I want to . Who you are  --  what you are  --  where you came from  --  does n't matter . But you 're talking to me over a very high fence  --  just taking a little peek at a queer animal out of sheer curiosity and because as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you 'll never see me me again . RUTHERFORD But I 'm not so  --  WEST Oh yes , you are  --  much more so  --  RUTHERFORD Well at least you must admit this  --  I 'm being much freer and much more wildly unconventional for me than you are for you . You 're used to it . It 's nothing at all for you to pick up a stranger and treat him like a friend . In fact , I heard you tell Annie there 's no such animal  --  as a stranger . WEST There 's something in that but when you get off the train this little incident will close for you  --  but for me it will stick as something I 've lost . p. 81 RUTHERFORD I  --  I shall remember . Not only the money and the ticket but you 've made these days interesting that would have been long and dreary . WEST But nevertheless I am  --  an incident  --  to you . RUTHERFORD Y-e-s . But  --  what  --  you 've done  --  and what you 've been these three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free and sweet  --  and  --  and different  --  apart from place and people  --  and anything I 've ever known or ever will know again . WEST Then why do n't you keep it ? RUTHERFORD It could n't last if I ever saw you again . Every day life would kill it . WEST Ca n't every day life have in it anything you want to put into it ? RUTHERFORD Oh , you do n't know  --  ( She draws back suddenly as the others begin to come back ) Oh , these people  --  ( Mrs. Bay , Lily , Frank and Charles come in from the diner , all watching Julie as they walk by . Jim goes back to his seat . Mr. Smith comes in with a large unlighted cigar in his mouth . He struts down to the other end of the car and back  --  with the air of taking a constitutional  --  oblivious of the other people  --  and meets Mrs. Welch as he turns. ) p. 82 WELCH , MRS . ( As she comes in from the diner  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoker . SMITH , MR . No , but this is my cigar . WELCH , MRS . I thought you had it lighted . Excuse me . SMITH , MR . All I need is a match . Got one ? ( Jim gives a box of matches to Mr. Smith . ) WELCH , MRS . ( To Julie ) Does he own the yacht ? SMITH , MR . ( Having lighted his cigar  --  much to Mrs. Welch 's horrified amazement ) Do n't be alarmed I 'm not going to stay out here . WELCH , MRS . I should hope not . SMITH , MR . ( Giving the matches back to Jim ) Much obliged ! ( Mr. Smith and Mrs. Welch try to pass each other but find the aisle inconveniently narrow . ) WELCH , MRS . Well  --  I 've never had any trouble before in my life getting through an aisle . SMITH , MR . I ca n't say I ever have either . p. 83 WELCH , MRS . ( Moving into one of the sections ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to walk by . SMITH , MR . That 's what I 've been trying to do for some time . ( Mr. Smith waddles on into his drawing room . ) WELCH , MRS . ( To Jim and Julie ) Do n't he take the prize as a human swine ? Would n't you think nobody else was on earth but him ? RUTHERFORD He 's just a little more outspoken than most of us . I do n't know that he 's so very different . WELCH , MRS . There may be some people just exactly like him . But I do n't happen to be that kind . Porter , why have n't you got my berth made up ? ( As the porter comes in with sheets and pillow cases ) Do it right away . ( She takes her bag and goes into the ladies ' dressing room . ) THE PORTER Yas 'm . RUTHERFORD How contented she is with herself ! It 's wonderful . FRANK ( To Lily ) Here 's an awfully pretty little piece of poetry in this magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? p. 84 LILY Oh , I could n't . FRANK Yes , you could . Please . LILY Oh dear ! I used to recite at school but I do n't believe I could read this to you . FRANK Come on , please . LILY ( Reading the poetry in a sing-song sentimental way ) Sweetheart , be my sweetheart When birds are on the wing When bee and bud and babbling flood Bespeak the birth of spring . Come sweetheart , be my sweetheart , And wear this posy ring . Sweetheart , be my sweetheart In the golden summer glow Of the earth aflush with gracious blush Which the ripening fields foreshow . Dear sweetheart , be my sweetheart , As into the moon we go . Sweetheart , be my sweetheart When falls the bounteous year , When the fruit and the wine of tree and vine Give us their harvest cheer . Oh sweetheart , be my sweetheart , For winter draweth near . ( During this the porter brings in a step ladder from left and stepping upon it , hangs the curtains for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window . Jim reads in his own seat. ) p. 85 BAY , MRS . ( As Lily finishes the third verse ) What is it , Lily ? Read it to me . ( Lily sits forward and reads the last verse in a louder voice . Mrs. Bay leaning towards her and keeping time with her head ) Sweetheart , be my sweetheart When the year is white and old When the fire of youth is spent forsooth And the hand of age is cold . Yet sweetheart , be my sweetheart , Till the year of love is told . CHARLES ( As Lily finishes ) Oh slush ! WEST ( Going back to Julie ) The thing I 've been waiting to say to you is this  --  RUTHERFORD What ? Say it . WEST Why did n't you fight it out for yourself back there  --  since you hate coming out here so fiercely ? RUTHERFORD Fight it out ? Make my own living , you mean ? Because I do n't know how . I 'm going out here because it 's the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horrible burden to them , and still I have n't the courage to jump off the train . Ridiculous  --  is n't it ? WEST Have n't you ever wanted to work with your hands ? To take hold of a thing and do it  --  make it go because you willed and were making your own power ? p. 86 RUTHERFORD No . WEST See here . It 's all up to you whether you 're beaten or not . You 've got two things to choose from . Either to go back to this little town and shrivel up into a bitter old woman  --  or to live by giving what you 've got to other people . If you have got something fine and precious which lifts you apart from the common herd  --  then give it out to other people . Give it  --  give  --  give . RUTHERFORD I have n't anything to give . WEST Then why did n't you marry somebody and stay back there where you say you belong ? RUTHERFORD He only had six thousand a year . That is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's true . He was right . WEST Six thousand a year not enough for one man to make one woman happy ? RUTHERFORD What do you think it takes to make one woman happy ? WEST Love  --  love and work . RUTHERFORD Oh yes  --  but the man ! WEST She must have the eyes to see him when he 's there . The heart to love him  --  the hands to work with him . The courage to take him when he comes . p. 87 RUTHERFORD ( Coming out of the spell and drawing back from him ) Oh  --  we are flying through space  --  up in the clouds . Stern reality is waiting at the other end . Why do n't I jump off the train now  --  now ? WEST I 'll open the door for you  --  if you want to do it . RUTHERFORD Do you mean that ? WEST I do . RUTHERFORD Will you help me ? WEST I 'll open the door . RUTHERFORD Would it be right ? WEST It 's your right  --  if you want it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people . WEST Well , are you going to do it ? RUTHERFORD Yes . ( She starts to rise , he takes her by the arms . ) WEST Some man was a coward not to keep you . RUTHERFORD You ca n't blame him . WEST Did you love him ? RUTHERFORD I would have married him . p. 88 WEST He was a fool and a coward . RUTHERFORD Oh , no . WEST Oh , yes . Why did n't he hold you and fight for you ? RUTHERFORD I 'm not worth it . WEST You are to me . ( Holding her by the wrists ) RUTHERFORD Oh  --  WEST Let me help you . Is n't that better than what you 've started to do ? Give yourself another chance . There 's so much of life waiting for you . Do n't do it . Wait . RUTHERFORD Oh , I  --  WEST You 've fallen out of the skies for me . You 're what I 've lost and what I 've wanted every day  --  every hour . Your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to throw it away or let me try to make things right for you ? Wait just a little . Give me a chance to make you know me . Do n't end it now . RUTHERFORD If this were all  --  yes  --  to sit here  --  with you . But this is n't real  --  talking to you like this . WEST It is . RUTHERFORD No . It 's just a wild moment or two  --  when I 'm letting go because nothing matters . p. 89 WEST They 're real moments . RUTHERFORD No  --  no they are not . This is n't me . WEST It 's the real you . RUTHERFORD No . It 's something new . I 'm talking to you because I do n't care  --  and because you 're strange and wonderful and there 's something in you I  --  I 've been looking for in someone else . I wanted it so  --  to cling to . To believe in . I do n't want to live . I do n't . I do n't ! Thank you  --  Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WEST I have n't done anything  --  but I could  --  I could ! RUTHERFORD It 's so strange to be pouring out my heart to you like this . WEST No , it is n't . RUTHERFORD I seem to want to tell you everything . ( She begins to sob  --  Jim puts his hand on hers to stop her as Mrs. Welch , singing , comes from the dressing room at R. end in a flamboyant kimona . She stops near Lily and the boys . Julie puts her head on her arm on the back of her seat and Jim , remaining where he is , takes up a book . ) WELCH , MRS . Why do n't you all go to bed ? It 's the best way to kill time I know of . Have n't you talked yourselves out yet ? p. 90 CHARLES ( Rising  --  looking Mrs. Welch over with a twinkle ) I 've just thought of something else I might say . WELCH , MRS . What ? CHARLES I  --  wo n't tell . WELCH , MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the train ever stops . ( The boys and Lily turn to stare at Julie . ) BAY , MRS . What 's the matter ? What did she say ? LILY Nothing , Grandma . BAY , MRS . ( Pointing to Julie ) Do n't talk to that lady any more , Lily . THE PORTER ( Coming to tap Mrs. Bay on the shoulder  --  with sheets and pillow cases over his arm ) I 'm ready for you now . SMITH , MR . ( Coming out of the drawing room in time to hear this ) No , you do n't . I 'm waiting . THE PORTER ( Hurrying into the drawing room ) Comin ' sir . Comin ' . BAY , MRS . You boys scuttle away now . I 'm going to get ready for bed myself . ( Mrs. Welch goes to her own berth and disappears behind the curtains . Mrs. Bay takes her suitcase and goes out . Leo strolls in from the diner at left , complacently using a toothpick. ) p. 91 LILY Oh , look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I left home . STERN ( Stopping by Julie ) Well  --  one day more and we 'll all get out of this box . You get off tomorrow , do n't you ? RUTHERFORD ( Unnerved and desperate ) I do n't know . Yes , I do . STERN I guess you and me are the only Eastern parties in the bunch . The others are going home to roost . When you 've seen as much of the country as I have you can spot ' em with one squint . This tall party here  --  turned in I guess  --  ( Nodding towards Mrs. Welch 's berth ) thinks she is putting it all over us . Funny , ai n't it ? ( Leo strolls back to his own section . ) WELCH , MRS . ( Making violent movements behind her curtains and thrusting her shoes out ) Porter ! Take those shoes and give them a good shine . A good one . Is that you , Porter ? STERN Guess again . WELCH , MRS . Well , where on earth is he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She throws shoes into the aisle  --  hitting Leo . ) Give him these . p. 92 STERN Here , do your rough housin ' on the inside . There 's passers by out here . CHARLES ( Coming down the aisle ) Is it safe to go by ? STERN I would n't risk it . WELCH , MRS . ( Emerging from her curtains  --  finishing the braiding of her hair ) Oh , Lord ! I 've bumped my head so I ca n't tell whether I 'm coming or goin ' . STERN Believe me your goin ' some . BAY , MRS . ( Coming down the aisle ) Can I get by ? STERN Not if I was the judge . ( Looking at Mrs. Bay who has put on her night cap and dressing gown . ) WELCH , MRS . That reminds me . I lost my boudoir cap this morning and never did find it . I wonder if that blamed porter took it . ANNIE ( Coming in , in time to hear this ) It 's under the seat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why on earth did n't you say so ? STERN I 'll get it for you . ( Leo dives for the missing cap and brings it out. ) p. 93 WELCH , MRS . Well upon my soul ! Would n't that jar you ! Thanks . ( Mrs. Welch tucks up her braid and puts on the cap  --  a most elaborate affair of lace , ribbons and flowers . ) Now if anybody disturbs me tonight , they 'll wish they had n't . STERN I promise I wo n't . WELCH , MRS . Good night everybody . ( She disappears again . ) CHARLES Nightie-night . STERN I do n't know but that I prefer Grandma 's . ( Indicating grandma 's cap . He takes up a magazine . ) WEST ( to Julie ) Do n't be so unhappy . Do n't . RUTHERFORD Oh , how white and big and soft that cloud is , and how fast it 's sailing ! I wish I could be caught up in it and disappear . WEST We do n't get off so easily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Throw away the part that 's been a disappointment and a failure . Look the new thing in the face . RUTHERFORD I can only see one thing  --  my own despair and I ca n't face it . I ca n't ! I want to escape it and I only know one way . You said you 'd open the door for me. p. 94 WEST I wo n't . RUTHERFORD Then I 'm going anyway . ( She rises . ) WEST ( Catching her ) I wo n't let you go . ( There is a crash . The lights go out  --  wild shrieks and cries  --  the sound of glass breaking and wood splitting . Pandemonium and darkness . Gradually words are distinguished above the cries and groans . ) WEST Are you alive ? RUTHERFORD Yes ! My head ! I 'm falling ! WEST Do you want to live or die ? RUTHERFORD I want to live ! Help me ! THE CURTAIN FALLS @x Time : Five o'clock the next morning . Place : A hill top covered with stubby grass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . Cold grey dawn is coming on . At Curtain : Leo appears dragging after him Mrs. Welch . Mr. Smith also emerges half pushing her from the back . The three are in an extremely dilapidated condition  --  their clothes torn and mud stained  --  their hair wildly disheveled . Mr. Smith is in pajamas and a raincoat  --  and one eye is conspicuously black and bruised . Mrs. Welch wears the dressing gown of Act II with a blanket about her shoulders . Her hair stands out in wisps and bunches but the cap dejected and bedrabbled is still in evidence . Leo is ghastly pale with a long cut on one cheek . The three gasping for breath reach the top and look disconsolately about . STERN It 's the top . WELCH , MRS . Thank God ! Let me sit down or I 'll drop . Anything to get away from these horrors ! I 'll never get over this night  --  never to my dying day ! STERN You want to be damn thankful it was n't your dying night . ( Leo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help her sit on a rock. ) p. 96 WELCH , MRS . ( Groaning elaborately ) Oh  --  oh  --  oh ! I 'm black and blue all over . SMITH , MR . ( Much chastened by the ordeals of the night ) Are you comfortable now ? I wish all our fellow passengers could come up to this place . I 'd like them to share our blessings . ( Sitting laboriously near Mrs. Welch ) WELCH , MRS . You 're so kind . STERN ( Laughing ) You might chase down and get some of your fellow passengers . SMITH , MR . I 'll make an effort . WELCH , MRS . No , you wo n't . You must be very tired . Let the other fellow do it . STERN ( Laughing still harder and looking at Mr. Smith and Mrs. Welch in amazement ) Misfortunes sure do make quick bed fellows . WELCH , MRS . Say , are you trying to be funny ? Do n't , it 's too early in the morning . STERN You 're right , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a sunrise . ( He goes up back , looking down and shouting as he sees someone below . ) Hey  --  hi  --  boys ! Come on up . What ? Yes , you can . Bring her up . Yes you can . Make a cat 's cradle and carry her  --  like this . ( Showing how to make a cat 's cradle . ) That 's the idea . p. 97 WELCH , MRS . Carry her ? Carry who ? STERN The young girl . She 's all right but she ca n't walk . SMITH , MR . Do you see any more of our fellow passengers down there ? STERN N-no . But I can see the engine . She must have just about turned a somersault . WELCH , MRS . Oh do n't ! STERN The first cars are all on top of her  --  where she took the header . WELCH , MRS . I 'll always ride in the last coach after this . That 's what saved us . SMITH , MR . We have many blessings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' up big now , ai n't they ? ( Looking down the hill again ) And I can see that Jim West fella out there where they 're mendin ' the bridge  --  bossin ' the job and workin ' harder'n anybody with his busted arm and shoulder . WELCH , MRS . And he broke it saving her . More 's the pity . SMITH , MR . Do you think it 's a pity she 's saved ? WELCH , MRS . I do n't go as far as to say that . p. 98 SMITH , MR . It 's very deplorable  --  she 's rapidly getting worse . When I saw her last  --  she was in a very bad way  --  almost raving . STERN That may not last long but you ca n't tell . Sometimes when you 're hit in the head like that you go back to a certain time and do n't remember anything else in between . SMITH , MR . It is n't a going back with her  --  rather a going forward . And she blurts it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't really tell the dividing line as to which is which . WELCH , MRS . You bet you ca n't . She 's got you fooled to a finish  --  you men . Lord , how a woman can fool men ! STERN You 're fooled this trip as sure as you 're born  --  She 's nutty  --  clean gone . SMITH , MR . And a very strange case . WELCH , MRS . Oh you make me sick . Why she 's just slick . That 's all  --  no more crazy than I am . She 's up against it . Has n't a cent in the world . Does n't want to go where she 's got to go and she 's going to get something out of this . She 's going to get a man someway . Look out . ( Looking at Smith ) If she do n't get the other one she 'll have you before you know it . p. 99 SMITH , MR . ( Much flattered ) Oh I 'm afraid she would n't look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's not straight , I tell you . STERN You 're barkin ' up the wrong tree . WELCH , MRS . Oh ! You ca n't tell a woman anything about women . SMITH , MR . I do n't know  --  I sometimes think , my dear Madam  --  WELCH , MRS . My name 's Welch . For heaven 's sake stop madaming me . SMITH , MR . I sometimes think my dear Mrs. Welch  --  STERN You sometimes think a man 's the only animal that knows a good woman when he sees one  --  and right you are , my friend . The lady in question is as straight as a die but as loony as a bed bug . What do you call this ? She walked straight up to him  --  before the whole push  --  and said ( Imitating Julie ) " I would rather have lost my life a thousand times , than to have had you suffer like this for me . I only hope the beauty of what you have done repays you . " Now you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 SMITH , MR . She said some very strange things to me , too . Something about how ridiculously clear it all is once one sees with the eyes of the soul . It 's very sad  --  very . WELCH , MRS . Rubbish ! Do n't tell me I do n't know a crazy woman from a bad one . I 'll put a question to him  --  West  --  that 'll show her up before you all . She 's trying to make us think he 's asked her to marry him . He ought to be put wise to it and I 'll do it . Oh Lord , I 'm so cold and starving and ache so I could yell ! SMITH , MR . Would you be more comfortable if you leaned on me ? WELCH , MRS . I might . ( Smith turns about and Mrs. Welch leans on his back . ) STERN ( Calling down the hill ) Good work ! That 's the business . Slick as a whistle . ( Charles and Frank appear carrying Lily in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wreck . Lily is exhausted with fatigue and her head droops against Frank 's . One foot and leg are clumsily tied up in a sheet . ) Put her over here ! Give me this , I 'll fix it . ( Taking the blanket which is over Frank 's shoulders and spreading it on a log. ) p. 101 CHARLES That 's the stuff . FRANK Be careful . ( As they put her down . ) LILY ( Faintly . ) Oh , what a lovely place . WELCH , MRS . ( Shivering and hugging herself in her blanket ) Yeh  --  beautiful ! Might just as well be home in your own bed it 's so warm and cozy . LILY You 've all been so kind . Everybody . I wish Grandma could come up here . She is n't hurt a bit . Is n't it wonderful ! SMITH , MR . I might make the effort to go and get her . ( Mrs. Welch digs Smith violently with her elbow for him to keep still . ) CHARLES She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LILY Miss Rutherford  --  her name is . Is n't she wonderful ? A regular angel of mercy she 's been all night . Helping everybody . She 's done some perfectly marvelous things . The doctors say so . WELCH , MRS . Oh , I do n't know . I held one woman 's head myself for about an hour . But when the doctor came along and said she was going to die anyway , I thought I might as well give that job up . p. 102 SMITH , MR . The Almighty has been very good to us and has watched over us . ( Sneezing again ) BAY , MRS . ( Bobbing up at the back . Her hair is down her back  --  her bonnet on one side , her dress skirt over one arm , her petticoat very torn and bedraggled , but she is smiling and cheerful and extremely spry in her movements . ) Well , well , well , how did you poor people manage to get up that hill ? It 's quite a climb for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking care of you . BAY , MRS . What ? ( Coming down to Lily ) CHARLES ( Hurrying quickly to speak in Mrs. Bay 's ear ) She thought Miss Rutherford was taking care of you . BAY , MRS . Fiddlesticks ! I ran away . I 'm so sick of everybody trying to take care of me , I could n't stand it another minute . Everybody 's calling for her . They need her  --  I do n't . ( Going to look at Mrs. Welch and Mr. Smith ) Well  --  how are you ? Trouble of any kind goes hard with fat people , but cheer up , you do n't feel half as bad as you think you do . ( Crossing over to Lily ) Lily , do n't pamper yourself too much . You must walk on that leg pretty soon before it gets stiff . p. 103 WELCH , MRS . If anything could have made me feel worse , it 's a dose of damn cheerfulness early in the morning . STERN ( Shaking hands with Mrs. Bay ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BAY , MRS . What ? Oh yes , good morning , I did n't recognize you at first . I do n't know your name . STERN My name is  --  Call me Leo . ( Jim comes up the hill . His left arm is in a rough sling . ) WELCH , MRS . Oh , here 's Mr. West . Has anything come ? SMITH , MR . Any relief in sight ? WEST Not yet . WELCH , MRS . Is n't anybody doing anything ? WEST Yes , I think everybody 's doing everything . The bridge is mended . I came up to see if you people are all right . Oh , I say , it must be pretty cold for you women sitting on the ground , is n't it ? Suppose you fellows pick up some wood and build a fire . That would be about the best thing that could happen , would n't it ? FRANK Let 's go to it . CHARLES Right you are ! p. 104 SMITH , MR . I might make the effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WELCH , MRS . No , you might n't . ( Turning to Leo ) You leave him alone . WEST It 's going to be pretty hard to find any small stuff around here . Try pretty well over there , see ? ( Pointing down the hill . Turning to Leo . ) I advise you to slow up .  --  You 've worked like a nailer . About all in , are n't you ? FRANK That 's right , do n't come . CHARLES ( Giving Leo a push . ) Lie down , Fido ! STERN ( Dropping on the ground as though Charles had knocked him down . ) Thanks for them kind words . WELCH , MRS . ( Groaning vociferously ) Oh-h-h will we ever get out of this ? BAY , MRS . What ? WELCH , MRS . Oh-h-h-h-h ! ( Burying her head in her arms , unable to cope with Mrs. Bay 's deafness and cheerfulness . ) WEST ( Raising his voice to Mrs. Bay ) We 're pretty lucky to be here , are n't we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! When I was thrown out in the aisle and people began walking on my stomach , and I heard the howls and groans I thought I had died and gone to hell , and all my life passed before me , and I wondered why I was there , when I heard our baby cry , and recognized it , and I never heard anything so sweet in all my life . WELCH , MRS . Well , I did n't think any great and noble dying thoughts . All I wanted was to get hold of those railroad officials and I will , too . If they do n't pay for my new spring clothes , I 'll know the reason why . STERN ( Sitting on a rock . ) When I took the header through the window and felt the glass flying , I said to myself , " Well , Leo , it 's come , and you ai n't got no accident policy . " That 's the first thing I do now when I get back to Broadway , take out a traveller 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're alive , but when you do cash in , it would be a nice idea to be able to say to yourself , " Somebody pays heavy for this . " I could see that last night when the bump came . WEST Yes , it 's wonderful what we see in that last flash , is n't it ? The things we wish we had n't done and the things we think we would do if we only had another day to do them in. p. 106 LILY Do your arm and shoulder pain perfectly terribly all the time , Mr. West ? WEST Oh no , they 're all right . LILY You broke them in such a perfectly beautiful way . WEST Yes , it was nice , was n't it ? WELCH , MRS . Pretty expensive business for you  --  saving her life and breaking yourself to pieces . WEST Well , I guess it 's worth it , when you think how many she 's saved herself , since . STERN That 's a good way to check it up . WELCH , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just what do you say she is , West ? WEST That 's more than I can even try to say . LILY There 's something so strange about her now . WEST Yes , do you see ? WELCH , MRS . How could a child see ? To put it in plain English , do you think she 's off her head since she was hit , or do you think she 's something else ? WEST ( With a slow , whimsical smile ) That depends a good deal on how you look at it , does n't it ? p. 107 WELCH , MRS . Oh  --  you 're not on  --  yet . LILY Oh her mind could n't be gone , could it ? STERN Certainly , it could . Could n't it , West , dead easy ? LILY She said to me just a little while ago  --  ( She stops as Julie appears at the back carrying the baby . Julie 's clothes are also torn and mud stained , her hair disheveled , her face pale  --  a man 's handkerchief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a sort of exaltation which radiates an intensity of energy , and rather a disconcerting honesty and simplicity  --  seeing things for the first time and expecting everyone else to see them the same way . There is a pause as they all turn to look at her and feel in her a subdued excitement . ) RUTHERFORD ( In a breathless tone . ) She 's gone . WELCH , MRS . Who ? RUTHERFORD Annie . ( Looking at Jim . ) You thought she was going to live  --  did n't you  --  but the shock and the whole thing were  --  She 's gone . ( There is a pause and a sympathetic murmur. ) p. 108 WEST Yes , I thought she 'd pull through . RUTHERFORD I believe she was glad to go  --  poor little woman . You were right . She was n't married to Bill . WELCH , MRS . Who 's Bill ? RUTHERFORD The man she was going to . And she was afraid to take the baby to him  --  and afraid she could n't take care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid to live . WELCH , MRS . She had no business to die . What 's going to become of that child ? RUTHERFORD That was the hard thing for her and she was so unhappy about it . I said I knew I could find someone to take her and love her  --  and the most beautiful look came into Annie 's face  --  a sort of radiance and  --  she just closed her eyes and slipped away  --  into peace  --  with one hand still holding this little hand . So I brought the baby right up to you first , Mrs. Welch , because I know you are generous and kind and well off and would love to have her . ( Kneeling before Mrs. Welch with the baby . ) WELCH , MRS . ( Drawing away in amazed alarm ) No ! I ca n't stand children . Anyway Harry would have a fit . What are you talking about ? p. 109 RUTHERFORD Oh , I thought you 'd think it was wonderful to get her like this . WELCH , MRS . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like her , Mr. Smith ? SMITH , MR . ( Gasping ) I 'm an unmarried man , Miss . RUTHERFORD Well all the more splendid for you to get her like this . SMITH , MR . I  --  You  --  She  --  I 'd like to accommodate you but it 's really quite impossible . WELCH , MRS . Of course it is . Even if anybody wanted to adopt a kid , who wants an illegitimate one with all its mother 's bad traits ? RUTHERFORD What has that to do with this love of a baby ? Besides her mother was a very wonderful woman . WELCH , MRS . What ? RUTHERFORD Was n't she , Mr. West ? WEST ( With an intense shyness before this new and compelling Julie . ) What makes you think so ? RUTHERFORD She understood and appreciated you , that was one of the reasons . She said , " Lady , that tall fellow is a great man . " Do n't you think that shows some great understanding ? p. 110 WEST She just wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she trusted too much . RUTHERFORD And never a word of littleness towards Bill . She said she loved him and that love had made her happy and that it was worth it all just to have had the baby to love for a little while . There 's something rather splendid about that you know . BAY , MRS . What is it , Lily ? What are they talking about ? LILY About adopting the baby . The mother died . Oh Grandma , could n't we take the baby ? BAY , MRS . ( Hopping up ) My stars child , no . Your mother 's raised one family and I 've raised two , that 's enough . ( Going to Julie ) What 's the matter , do you have to find a home for it ? RUTHERFORD Yes I do  --  I must . BAY , MRS . She 's a nice child . I 'll see what our Church Society can do about it . WELCH , MRS . That 's a good idea . SMITH , MR . Excellent . STERN ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's a darned fine kid . p. 111 RUTHERFORD ( Turning to him with the baby ) Is n't she ? A blessed , blessed little precious thing ! STERN ( Backing away ) But do n't wish her on me , she ai n't in my line . If she was a boy now , I 'd stake him to pants as soon as he was ready , but I ai n't got nothing in her line at all . WEST Do n't worry , you 'll find a place for her some way . RUTHERFORD Yes , I know , what we want to be , can be . That 's true , is n't it ? Every word you said has come true  --  more true , more glorious than you know . Something great enough to make up for this has come . ( Laying her hand tenderly on his broken arm . ) At least I want it to do that . Do you know what I mean ? WEST ( Lowering his eyes ) Perhaps ! Do n't say it and there 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path . ) RUTHERFORD Are you going down ? WEST Yes , and I 'm going to see if any help has come . ( He goes down the hill . ) RUTHERFORD Annie was right , he is a great man and what 's more , he 's a good man , with something so big and sweet and revealing in him , that one sees God for the first time through him . Is n't that true ? p. 112 WELCH , MRS . He 's an ordinary good-hearted man ridin ' on a railroad train , if that 's what you mean . RUTHERFORD You hold her , Mrs. Welch , for a minute . If you 've never had a baby , you do n't know how wonderful it feels to have her in your arms . You hold her a minute and you 'll love her . Oh , you do n't know how sweet you are sitting there . It makes you look so much warmer and happier . ( Julie walks about restless and exalted . ) SMITH , MR . Now , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ought to go off to some quiet spot and lie down . RUTHERFORD Lie down ?  --  I could n't . I never felt so strong in my life . STERN ( Going to Julie anxiously ) Has the doctor examined your head very carefully ? RUTHERFORD Oh , it 's nothing but a cut and a bruise . Was I unconscious long ? SMITH , MR . ( Going over to Julie very cautiously ) How do you  --  how do you  --  feel ? STERN Do you seem to  --  How do things seem to you  --  pretty much exaggerated , eh ? You have n't gone to the Golden Gates , or anything like that . Things are just as they were before you got hit . p. 113 RUTHERFORD Oh no , the whole world has changed to me . STERN No  --  no  --  it 's just everyday stuff , you know . A spade is still a spade . RUTHERFORD ( Exaltedly ) Yes , a spade is a spade but one can do wonderful things with it . I watched those men down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them were so strong and clever and lifted those great beams and put them where they wanted them . They have come to the real things and are all working together for the same end  --  men  --  brothers .  --  It 's wonderful . Have n't you felt it , the thrill of it ? Has n't it made you want to use your own arms and hands and strength and will to make life right ? Has n't it ? STERN Does it pain you all the time ? ( Pointing to her head ) SMITH , MR . ( Turning to Mrs. Welch ) It 's taken rather a religious turn . RUTHERFORD ( Looking at Leo for the first time ) Oh Mr. Stern , did you know you have a very long cut across your cheek ? STERN ( Backing away from her ) Oh no , no , you only think it . p. 114 RUTHERFORD The doctor gave me a few things and I 've watched him till I can do it pretty well . You must let me bandage it for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bandage from the pockets of her sweater . ) STERN Oh no , I 'm all right . I 'm getting along very well , thank you . ( Trying to get away from her . ) RUTHERFORD No , you 're not . Sit down here and let me do it right away . STERN ( Sitting very dubiously as Julie takes him by the arm ) I 'm getting along all right this way , but I do n't think I could stand anything more . RUTHERFORD Oh my , it is bad ! You 've got mud or something in the wound . ( Going at him with interested energy ) STERN You do n't say ! How careless of me ! RUTHERFORD Fortunately I have this little bottle to wash it out with . STERN A bottle ? RUTHERFORD I mean with what 's in the bottle . STERN Oh ! RUTHERFORD Now hold very still please . p. 115 STERN I ca n't promise . ( Julie bathes the cut with alcohol . ) Jee-rusalem , is that pure alcohol ? RUTHERFORD Perfectly pure . STERN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pain ) RUTHERFORD Oh , does it hurt so ? It is a bad cut . I 'm glad I had these things . Hold still . The only way the bandage seems to fit is this way . ( Putting it under his chin and over his head . ) I have n't got any more of those pins . You do n't mind , do you ? STERN Just so I do n't look untidy . ( Trying to move his jaw . ) And give me a little jaw action , if you do n't mind , that 's all I ask . RUTHERFORD There , I hope you 'll be more comfortable . STERN ( As she allows him to get up ) I hope so too . I 'm much obliged anyway . I take it just as you meant it . RUTHERFORD I have n't forgotten what you did to my eye , you know . I 'm paying you back . STERN ( Keeping away from her ) You win , I 'm paid . I think I 'll go down and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( He goes down. ) p. 116 RUTHERFORD ( Taking the baby from Mrs. Welch and going to Lily . ) Would n't you like to hold the baby , Lily ? Poor child , how sleepy you are ! ( She puts the baby in Lily 's arms and tucks a blanket about them . ) SMITH , MR . ( Rising , starting after Leo , turning back to glance at Julie and holding up a warning finger to Mrs. Welch . ) And be very cautious . I would n't irritate her . BAY , MRS . I 'll put on my dress skirt now . You see I saved it by taking it off . RUTHERFORD ( Sitting beside Lily . ) How do you feel ? LILY Oh it hurts , but I do n't mind . Are you  --  do  --  you feel  --  quite well ? RUTHERFORD Yes . LILY I mean  --  I  --  I think I ought to tell you . Some of them think you 're out of your head . RUTHERFORD That 's wonderful ! It 's such a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not , are you ? RUTHERFORD I 'll tell you a secret . If I am  --  I want to be always . He 's fallen out of the skies . p. 117 LILY You mean ? ( Julie nods . ) But  --  are n't you afraid ? ( Julie shakes her head . ) Do n't you think we  --  we  --  we ought to know a man  --  a long time  --  before we  --  we  --  fall in love ? RUTHERFORD When the miracle happens , we do know him . LILY But ought n't we to be friends first ? RUTHERFORD Oh no . One has all one 's life to be friends . Why ask love to wait ? LILY Yes , but I was wondering . RUTHERFORD Oh , my dear little girl . He 's a nice boy . Do n't be afraid to let him know what you feel . LILY Yes , but grandma would be so  --  RUTHERFORD Yes , I know but do n't hurt him . You may never see him again . It 's a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horror . Let it blossom all it can . LILY ( A little awestricken at Julie ) What made you like this now ? RUTHERFORD Suffering and love .  --  They brought understanding . WELCH , MRS . ( Having gone to sleep and fallen over ) Oh , oh , oh , my back ! My back ! ( Grandma and Julie run to her. ) p. 118 LILY What is it ? WELCH , MRS . It 's a cramp . It 's killing me . RUTHERFORD Where is it ? WELCH , MRS . My back , my back ! Oh Lord , what shall I do ? RUTHERFORD ( Rubbing Mrs. Welch 's back vigorously ) Is that the place ? WELCH , MRS . No , lower down , lower down , lower down . RUTHERFORD Is that doing any good ? WELCH , MRS . I do n't know that it is , but it might . BAY , MRS . If I only had my good liniment ! RUTHERFORD It 's making me warm , anyway . WELCH , MRS . You need n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh  --  ( Groaning with satisfaction ) RUTHERFORD Better ? Better ? Is that better ? WELCH , MRS . I do n't know but that it is . Much obliged . BAY , MRS . That 's very apt to happen to fat people . WELCH , MRS . I 'm not fat . ( Jim comes back up the hill. ) p. 119 RUTHERFORD Could n't you take a little exercise to get warm ? WELCH , MRS . Yes , I 'd just love to swing dumbbells right now for my health . WEST Get up . Walk about . The worst thing you can do is to sit still , on that rock . WELCH , MRS . Well , if you can show me anything better to sit on around here , I 'll do it . WEST Get up , get up . WELCH , MRS . I wo n't . Oh  --  oh  --  oh  --  oh ! Must I ? WEST Certainly . ( Mrs. Welch rises with the help of Julie and Mrs. Bay . ) Now walk . WELCH , MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not used to it . WEST The sun 's trying to show itself out there . It ca n't get in here just yet . Go out on that slope . That 's where it will start first . BAY , MRS . ( Following Mrs. Welch ) Where are you going ? WELCH , MRS . ( Shouting at Mrs. Bay and hobbling off ) To the jumping off place . BAY , MRS . I 'll come with you . I 'm very surefooted . ( Trotting after Mrs. Welch ) p. 120 WEST ( Looking at Lily ) She 's asleep . Are n't you going ? I 'll stay here . RUTHERFORD What is it ? Have I done anything to displease you ? WEST Of course not . RUTHERFORD Or to disappoint you ? WEST No . RUTHERFORD I 'm trying so hard to show you how grateful I  --  WEST Do n't please . You do n't owe me anything . Nothing is different because I had the luck to save your life . Things are just as they were before all this happened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said  --  big and sweet and wonderful  --  if we make it . I want to give all the rest of mine to you  --  to thank you . WEST That 's what you must n't think . That 's what I wo n't let you say . That 's what you ca n't do . RUTHERFORD Why not ? WEST You do n't owe me anything . RUTHERFORD But I  --  WEST You have n't changed because of me . You see and know because you 've seen death and suffering . You 're cold and hungry now and close to humanity and you 've made things better for others by giving of yourself . That 's why you 're glad to be alive . It 's yourself  --  yourself  --  not me. p. 121 RUTHERFORD It all came through you . WEST No . RUTHERFORD But the things you said to me  --  WEST The things I asked when you were throwing yourself away  --  I do n't ask now , and the things you said out of pity and gratitude are all washed out . The bridge is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your feet . We 're two travellers who have touched hands and are the better for it . RUTHERFORD What have I done ? What 's changed you ? WEST You 're reborn and further away from me than ever . When you 're down there , on the level again ( Pointing down the hill ) out of the heights  --  you 'll see me as I am  --  a plain man , not fit to touch you  --  separated from you by every law of your world . RUTHERFORD ( Looking steadily into Jim 's eyes ) You said she must have the eyes to see him when he 's there  --  the courage to take him when he comes  --  the hands to work with him  --  the heart to love him . I 'm here . ( She stops as the voices of the boys are heard . Jim turns , about to go , when Frank appears  --  followed by Leo , Charles and Smith carrying wood for a fire. ) p. 122 STERN Here fellows  --  here 's a good place , over here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FRANK ( Going to kneel by Lily ) Wake up . We 're going to have a fire . LILY What ? Oh goodness  --  where am I ? FRANK Up at the top of the world . LILY Oh  --  I had the most wonderful dream . FRANK I guess you 've got plenty of time to tell it before breakfast  --  so it 'll come true . LILY I wish it would . I dreamed that I was never going to see you again . FRANK Oh say ! LILY Wait , it was nice . I mean Mother did n't want me to write to you or have you come to see me  --  but it  --  it was sweet anyway  --  because I had known you . FRANK Oh ! Is that all ! WELCH , MRS . ( Hobbling back with Grandma ) Where 's that grand fire you were talking about ? You 've been gone long enough to burn up the whole mountain . ( She sits on the rock at left above the spot where the men are making the fire. ) p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . You must all go out and look . WELCH , MRS . Thank you . I 've had enough scenery to last for the rest of my life . Why in the name of common sense do n't you light the fire ? CHARLES Who 's got a match ? STERN I have , but only one and it 's got to do the business . Now do n't breathe anybody and make a draft . ( Taking Smith 's cap and handing it to Frank ) Hold this hat , Kid . CHARLES Hold it lower down so it 'll catch quicker . LILY Oh , would n't it be awful if it does n't light ? WELCH , MRS . For Heaven 's sakes do n't fool with it . RUTHERFORD Shall we all stand around and keep off the air ? STERN No  --  keep away  --  keep away . Do n't talk . CHARLES Turn it the other way , Frank . ( Frank turns the cap . ) STERN No you do n't . Put her back . CHARLES I tell you the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is but this is my match . Turn that hat round the way I told you , Kid . Now hold still . ( There is a breathless pause as Leo strikes the match and they all watch . ) BAY , MRS . What 's the matter ? Why do n't they hurry and light the fire ? STERN Tell the old lady to stop her conversation . ( Julie , Lily and Mrs. Welch motion to Mrs. Bay to keep quiet . They all watch the match tensely . ) WELCH , MRS . Oh Lord , it 's going out ! STERN Hold that hat still . CHARLES Turn the match up . STERN You shut up ! FRANK Wait  --  she 's coming . Look out  --  there ! Careful , there she comes . STERN Do n't move . Ah there we are . Oh ,  --  blast it ! ( They all groan as the match goes out . ) WEST Wait , there 's a spark . ( They blow the fire until it blazes up . There is a chorus of delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a blaze ? p. 125 RUTHERFORD It 's too good to be true ! Oh , is n't that splendid ! WELCH , MRS . Thank Heaven ! I could n't have held out much longer . STERN Come close , ladies , and get next . ( They all talk at once as they seat themselves round the fire  --  stretching out their hands and feet to it with grateful groans . ) WELCH , MRS . Why did n't somebody think of this before ? Say , do you know what the best thing in the world would be right now ? THE OTHERS What ? WELCH , MRS . A cup of coffee . ( They groan again  --  the mere mention of coffee making them lose their moral courage . ) CHARLES I could walk all the way home if I had some food . WELCH , MRS . ( Getting up stiffly ) You would n't be so spry about walking if you were in bedroom slippers . My feet will never come back to their natural size  --  never ! Look at that  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swollen and bruised ) I do n't see for the life of me how I stand it at all . I honestly do not see how I stand it . p. 126 RUTHERFORD ( Stretching her hands to the fire ) I know . Is n't it funny how we 're doing all the things we thought were the very ones we could not do . ( The Porter appears at back carrying a large basket filled with bread and ham  --  cups , a bottle of milk , and a coffee pot  --  a bucket of water and a package of coffee . He can scarcely carry his load from exhaustion and a lame knee and shoulder . His clothes are in a deplorable condition and his general appearance pathetically funny . They hail him with delight . ) CHARLES Look who 's here ! You 're the hero of the day , George Washington . STERN Welcome to our fireside ! WELCH , MRS . My God , the coon 's human . He 's even brought coffee . THE PORTER Yes ma'am ! You could n't git @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coffee pot and coffee ) This must go right on the fire to boil . WEST Here 's a place for it . BAY , MRS . We must n't spill it . Every drop is precious . THE PORTER ( Taking a man 's tan shoe out of one pocket and a black one out of the other and holding it out to Mrs. Welch ) Here , lady , I heard you whinin ' for shoes all night . These is the best I could do . p. 127 WELCH , MRS . ( Seizing the shoes ) You angel ! Now is n't that sweet !  --  Oh let me get ' em on quick . ( Hanging on the porter 's arm she kicks off the slippers and puts her feet in the shoes with many groans of pain . ) Oh , Lord , how it hurts ! THE PORTER ( Holding her up and helping to put the shoes on ) Dey do n't exactly match , lady , but they 're the best I could do . WELCH , MRS . Match your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip you ever had but I have n't got anything left but the gold in my teeth . THE PORTER Dat 's all right lady . I ai n't out fer graft this trip . WELCH , MRS . Everything lost . All my jewelry gone , but I know you did n't take it , Sambo , you 're a very honest man . THE PORTER I ai n't stole nuthin ' but them shoes . WELCH , MRS . You 'll go to Heaven for that . Any sign of that coffee boiling ? WEST Not yet . WELCH , MRS . Well , do n't sit there watching the pot or it will never boil . ( Frank and Charles have emptied the baskets . Frank is cutting the bread and Charles the ham. ) p. 128 RUTHERFORD ( Bending over the baby ) Here 's some milk for you , precious . Is n't she the most angelic baby in the world not to cry ? Here dearest  --  Oh , see , she 's starving . You blessed , blessed little thing . ( The women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice piece of bread and ham for everybody . WEST She 's boiling ! ( They sit about the fire helping each other with a new and exaggerated kindness . ) STERN I 've got mine . Sambo , here 's a sandwich . SAMBO ( Modestly and very grateful for the sudden attention ) Oh , I 'll sit over here . RUTHERFORD No  --  no , sit over here by the fire . STERN Gosh , smell that coffee ! Is that the same brand I 've been kicking about for four days ? WELCH , MRS . ( Leaning forward eagerly ) Keep on pouring  --  keep on pouring ! STERN You can pour mine right down my throat if you will . ( Deep grunts and groans express their comfort as they eat and drink and talk with their mouths full. ) p. 129 BAY , MRS . We have a great deal to be thankful for . ' Spose we offer up our thanks in a little hymn of praise . Lily you start it . LILY Oh , Grandma , I could n't ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( In a sweet quavering voice she begins " Praise God from whom all blessings flow . " Charles and Frank laugh . ) RUTHERFORD Oh , do n't laugh ! ( She sings softly with Mrs. Bay and gradually they all join in  --  at first lamely and then with honest thankfulness as the feeling grows . It swells into some discordant notes and into strains of real harmony , greatly aided by Sambo , the only one who sings with complete musical abandon . As they finish there is a long pause in which they gradually come back to self-consciousness . ) RUTHERFORD ( Very quietly ) I 've found a place for the baby . THE OTHERS Where ? RUTHERFORD I 'm going to keep her myself . WELCH , MRS . What ? RUTHERFORD Oh , you do n't think I 'm fit to take care of her , but I love her  --  and after all , love is the greatest thing in the world that can be given to her , is n't it ? p. 130 SMITH , MR . Oh , we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Hushing Smith with a gesture and speaking to Julie ) Do n't you fool with a thing like that . Why , you do n't know what you 're letting yourself in for . It means everything you 're not used to  --  sacrifices and hard things you hate . My God , it 's an awful job taking care of a baby . How on earth can you do it ? RUTHERFORD I do n't know  --  but I just know I can . I must do it . It 's the reason I 'm alive myself . I know that now . Think of it , Mrs. Welch , she 'll need me . I 'm the only thing in the world she 'll know  --  ( Getting to her feet ) and I 'll have to learn to take care of us both . WELCH , MRS . She 's bluffing  --  and fooling with a pretty serious thing . And what 's more , if it comes to a showdown that kid belongs to all of us as much as it does to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to become of it . RUTHERFORD But I know this  --  whatever I am , however worthless and weak , I have got the strength to take care of this baby . Oh , let me try  --  I can do it and I will .  --  Do n't you believe me ? WELCH , MRS . ( With a sudden conviction and a catch in her throat ) You bet I believe you . But I want to laugh . ( Looking at Jim ) I was going to show her up to you . I thought she 'd fooled you . But now I think you 'd be pretty lucky to get her p. 131 WEST I would be  --  the luckiest man in the world  --  but I have n't the slightest right in the world to ask her . ( Shouts from below . ) That means the relief train is here . Come on , Mrs. Bay . I 'll take you down . BAY , MRS . What 's the matter ? I do n't want to go down . I want to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Why is n't he going to marry her ? WELCH , MRS . Oh , shut up ! Stop talking about something you do n't know anything about . ( Mrs. Welch takes the baby from Lily and puts it in Julie 's arms  --  turning to the others . ) Look here  --  it 's just as much our business to help take care of that kid as it is hers . I 'm going to give five hundred a year . Smith , you can do better than that , how much do you say ? SMITH , MR . Why , whatever you say , of course . WELCH , MRS . A thousand will do for you to start with . STERN Now you 're shouting . WELCH , MRS . Now go on down everybody , we 'll come in a minute . ( Leo , Smith , Charles and Frank gather round Lily and the baby. ) p. 132 WELCH , MRS . ( To Julie ) I 'm going to take you to ma 's till we get things straightened out . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to open up the windows and let in some fresh air . RUTHERFORD Oh  --  WELCH , MRS . Do n't try to talk . I know everything you want to say . Come on down . That 's the first thing to do . RUTHERFORD I want to sit here alone just a few minutes  --  till I  --  WELCH , MRS . I know , till you get a grip on yourself . I 'm just going to take you under my wing . I do n't often take a fancy to anybody  --  but when I do I stick . CHARLES I 'll stay with her . ( To Leo ) You help Frank with Lily , will you ? STERN Sure . ( Going quickly to help Frank make a cat 's cradle for Lily and turning back to Julie as they start down the hill . ) I 'll see you later . Do n't you be lonely , Julie . You 've got lots of good friends and little Leo 's right on the job . SMITH , MR . May I offer my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kindest thing you can do is to go on down the hill . p. 133 SMITH , MR . But I wish to say that  --  WELCH , MRS . You 'll have plenty of time to say it . I need you now . Go on . Oh , these blessed shoes ! Hey , do n't go so fast , I 'm no little fleet foot . SMITH , MR . ( Turning back to help her ) Be very cautious . Let me go first and you put both hands on my back . WELCH , MRS . I will . Go on . Take good care of her , Charlie , and come down in a minute . I 'll be waiting for you , Julie dear . Oh , go on ! Go on ! ( Giving Smith an impatient push . ) CHARLES ( After a pause , kneeling beside Julie ) I wish there was something I could do . RUTHERFORD You 're all so good . CHARLES I 'd be so proud to marry you and help take care of the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy ! CHARLES I 'd cut college and go to work right away . Wo n't you think about it ? I 'm not so young as I look . RUTHERFORD You dear , dear boy ! How sweet you are ! How kind the world is. p. 134 CHARLES Do you want him ? ( He turns as Jim appears again at the path . ) Oh  --  I guess I 'll go down . You do n't need me . ( Charles goes off slowly down the path . ) WEST You will let me help you with her  --  wo n't you ? RUTHERFORD Oh  --  no  --  That wo n't be necessary . WEST You mean you do n't want  --  RUTHERFORD I sha n't need you . WEST But if there 's anything  --  anything in any way I can do  --  will you let me  --  ( She looks at him and moves up toward the path ) I wo n't come near you  --  if you do n't want me to  --  but just to know that a friend is over there behind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your life a little , is n't it ? RUTHERFORD ( Turning )  --  I 'm not separated from you by anything in heaven or earth . I love you . WEST You ca n't . It 's life  --  not me  --  you love . RUTHERFORD Then you are life  --  I love you . p. 135 WEST ( Closing his arms about her ) Be sure what you are doing . RUTHERFORD I love you  --  I love you ! WEST Oh , I 'll take care of you . I do n't just love you  --  I worship you . ( Voices call to them as ( END OF PLAY. )                                                                              @ @ @
