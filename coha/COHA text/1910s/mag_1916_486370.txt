Mr. Hughes took notice , in his speech in Philadelphia , of President Wilson 's assertion that the supporters of Hughes are of radically different political opinions . On the face of things , this charge has much to warrant it . The union between the Republican party and the Progressive party is mechanical , not chemical . So far as either is true to its inner nature and its former professions , it can not blend with the other . It would be absurd to suppose that Roosevelt and Taft  --  or , better , Roosevelt and Penrose  --  are now two souls with but a single thought  --  unless that thought be anything to beat Wilson . The Old Guard may sit alongside the radicals at public meetings , but at heart the two are miles asunder . For campaign purposes , all sorts of heterogeneous people are working together to elect Hughes , but they are doing it with no liking for one another , with few ideas in common , and without any zeal or joy in their temporary union . So it looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Mr. Hughes denies it . He undertakes to point out the bond of unity which unites his followers , and affirms that , however they may differ in other matters , they are " all agreed that American industries should be protected . " This may " go " in Philadelphia . There the tariff is still a word of might and magic . It serves as a cloak for all kinds of municipal rascalities . But elsewhere people will demur to what Mr. Hughes says on this point . They will desire to know , in the first place , what he means by protecting American industries . And if he means simply a brute reversion to the McKinley and Dingley and Payne-Aldrich tariffs , with their methods of political bargain and sale , the next question put to Mr. Hughes will be if he does not know that this kind of tariff-making , far from binding the Republican party together , in fact tore it apart . The historic truth is that the beginnings of the great Republican split of 1912 go back to the tariff legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it was the great occasion for the display of the irreconcilable tendencies which were dividing the party . The dissenters were first called " insurgents . " But they were really the first of the Progressives , and the thing on which they made their fight was a tariff conceived and enacted in the interest of a class . Those Republican Senators who stood out to the last against their party on this issue ? Dolliver , Cummins , La Follette , and the others  --  were really the begetters of the true Progressive party . And they are still witnesses to the truth that a selfish high tariff is as a sword thrust into the vitals of the Republican party . There was great courage in that original Progressivism . The name had not then been seized upon to conceal mad personal ambitions , or made the rallying-cry for all sorts of disgruntled and scheming men . Those Progressives before the Progressives took their political lives in their hands , all for the sake of letting the American people know what was going on , and all for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , another log-rolled and swinish tariff should never get the assent of both houses of Congress . Thus when Mr. Hughes remarks so easily that all who intend to vote for him are fused in a common belief in stiff protection , he ignores what has happened in the past seven years . If there is one thing upon which his supporters are not agreed it is this very matter of the old-style Republiean tariff . And the worst of it is that all of Mr. Hughes 's references to protection have been of the most narrow and undiscriminating kind . He appears to have absorbed the prehistoric and unthinking doctrine in his youth , and never to have looked into it since . At any rate , it now oozes from him in an innocent sort of way that is really alarming . He passes through a factory town in Maine , and asks how any good American can look upon such a scene of industry and consent for an instant to allow its product to be brought into competition with European goods . The brand of protection he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his speeches , is what most students of the subject , including many tariff-men , had come to think of as obsolete in this country . And if there is agreement among supporters of Hughes on any form of tariff policy , it is certain that there is the sharpest division over the species of raw protection of which he throws out chunks from time to time . Mr. Hughes ought not to be so anxious to effect union in his party , on whatever basis , as to forget the need of attracting independent voters . There will be more of them than ever , this year , and a campaign which leaves them cold , or actually repels them , is a confessed failure . Nothing could be more maladroit or hopeless than to bid for independent support while exalting the kind of tariff that has become a stench in the nostrils . An unblinking high protectionist might be voted for by independents if they thought he was indispensable in a national crisis . In that spirit , they supported McKinley in 1896 . But Mr. Hughes , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confronted the country , has not succeeded in doing that  --  or convincing the people that he is the man to deal with it if it exists  --  and has uttered a lot of drivel about the tariff . CONCERNING OUR DEALINGS WITH WEAK NATIONS . It was reported that Mr. Hughes would assail Mr. Wilson 's conduct of affairs in Nicaragua . Perhaps he found that he could not with Republican consistency . But a critic might be tempted to do so who read that at the election just held in Nicaragua the candidate favored by the State Department at Washington was elected by a small number , the other voters absenting themselves from the polls as a protest against American domination . It is a bit startling to learn that the presence of American warships , sent " to insure order during the elections , " was regarded by the natives as a direct interference in their choice of an Executive . And it was under the Administration of a President of the United States who had loudly declared that " the people of small and weak states have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of big and powerful states would be . " It was on this ground that he justified his refusal to interfere by force in Mexico . Just what is the situation in Nicaragua to-day , it is almost impossible to say . The New York bankers interested in rehabilitating the country insist that our policy has been just and generous and free from undue meddling . But nobody denies that the present Nicaraguan Government , and the incoming one , are upheld by American marines . Thus it appears that we are doing in Nicaragua and Haiti and Santo Domingo the very thing that the President has said we should not do . His principles in these matters are of the best ; his practice strangely contradicts them . One must think so when one is told that Admiral Caperton 's vessels are in Nicaraguan waters to land more marines " the instant that there is a sign of a revolution , " and learns from Washington that , owing to recent events , such as the ratification of our $3,000,000 treaty with that country , " it has become of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly Government in Nicaragua . " This dispatch alone would seem to justify the Nicaraguans in believing that the United States Government intended to elect the new President , Chamorro , willy-nilly . In Santo Domingo , President Wilson 's course has been even more surprising . No Americans had been injured there , and no American property had been interfered with . Yet , without authority from Congress , Mr. Wilson interfered , and the country is now controlled by our troops . The Santo Domingans may well say that their expectation of being " dealt with exactly as the people of big and powerful states would be " has been pretty thoroughly frustrated . It is certain that the President would not have proceeded similarly in the case of any " big and powerful " nation . The same is true of Haiti , whiCh has been induced to sign a treaty with the United States that deprives it of its sovereignty for a period of ten years . Many of its citizens protest ; but they are told that nothing else was possible ; that they had allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervened , France or England would have done so . The Nicaraguan mess Mr. Wilson inherited from his Republican predecessor . In Santo Domingo the first step was taken by President Roosevelt . Mr. Hughes ? can not quarrel successfully with the policy . It is only as to its execution that he may find fault , and with Mr. Wilson 's failure to make Republicans who have been the Imperialists and have stood for interfering in the affairs of our neighbors of the Caribbean . Far more members of that party than of the Democratic have been urging that we should " carry the flag to Cape Horn . " More than that , mere disputing over the way in which Mr. Wilson has done a wrongful thing would get Mr. Hughes and his party nowhere . The facts we have alluded to emphasize anew what we have already pointed out  --  the lack in this campaign of a really broad , statesmanlike discussion of our foreign relations . If Mr. Hughes has something to say about our Caribbean policy of the future , and should give certain pledges as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a different matter . The difficulty is that everything is going by default in the West Indies . In regard to the purchase of the Danish West Indies , where we shall buy another serious negro problem , there has been no adequate public debate . We can hardly hope that , under our form of government , foreign matters like these can be passed upon by the electorate , especially in a campaign where there is so extraordinary a multiplicity of issues . Much that is taking place in Nicaragua and Haiti and elsewhere is possible only because of the general public 's ignorance of it all . We do not question that Mr. Wilson is correct in his interpretation of the treatment the people of the United States desire for the Philippines and the lesser nations now under our tutelage , nor that they would insist on it if they were aware of our interference abroad . The pity of it is , as in other foreign matters , that we are getting no illuminating discussion of principles and policies ; that we shall get at most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign Mr. Hughes has led us to expect from him . A NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL . It will probably some day appear strange that public announcement of the inauguration of the work of the National Research Council opens with the statement that it has received assurance that it will have funds enabling it to proceed with its plans . So great is the outlook for its achievement that such an assurance should not have been lacking for a moment . All the more , however , is it to the credit of the Engineering Foundation , and of those to whose generosity the Foundation owes its pecuniary resources , that the income of its $200,000 endowment , together with an additional contribution of $5,000 annually , and the services of its secretary , are to be placed at the disposal of the Council . And an added source of gratification is to be found in the statement that " the motive of the engineers , 30,000 of whom are represented in the Foundation , in coming to the aid financially of the researchers , is their acknowledged debt to pure science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The purpose of the Council , as it has been formally stated , is to bring into cooperation existing governmental , educational , industrial , and other organizations for research , " with the object of encouraging the investigation of natural phenomena , the increased use of scientific research in the development of American industries , the employment of scientific methods in strengthening the national defence , and such other applications of science aS will promote the national security and welfare . " Established by the National Academy of Sciences with the sanction and cooperation of the President of the United States , and comprising in its personnel many of the foremost representatives of both pure and applied science in America , it is impossible to doubt that the Council will achieve in abundant measure the objects for which it has been organized . To endeavor to indicate those objects more specifically would be to attempt a survey of a domain of human activity whose extent , variety , and importance are equally imposing . All that one can touch upon in a brief notice is the spirit in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On both points all the signs are most propitious . In all its approaches to institutions and to individual men of science and industry alike , the Council has been met in a spirit of hearty and enthusiastic cooperation , and it will enter upon its labors with the zeal of its leading men quickened by the sense of a general and cordial interest in its endeavors on the part of those to whom it must appeal . One feature which we feel is peculiarly gratifying is the prominent place that is evidently held in the minds of the members of the Council by the idea that the importance of pure science  --  the pursuit of scientific truth for its own sake  --  must be strenuously insisted upon and constantly upheld . The idea is conspicuously present in the minutes of the proceedings at the organizing meeting of the Council ; and in a statement given out to the press by Dr. George Ellery Hale , chairman of the Council , occasion is taken to enforce the point . He mentions that the president of a great British steel company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure science , who has not in view monetary gains , but is willing to advance the world 's knowledge for the sake of knowledge , and that alone . " He even refers to the fact that " Monsieur Painlev ? , a pure mathematician , is one of the ablest men of the French Cabinet " ? a fact which , to be sure , has no direct bearing on the matter , but which perhaps points the moral just as effectively , at least for those who know upon what intricate and subtle problems , utterly removed from all contact with human interests , Monsieur Painleve was sharpening his intellect before he responded to the call for public service . Nor is the conjuncture a new one in France ; to mention only one precedent , Carnot , whom all the world thinks of as the man who " organized victory " for the First Republic , is remembered by mathematicians as the author of the theory of transversals and of a famous work on the philosophy of the infinitesimal calculus . This , however , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there can be no law , not to a principle . The broad principle that the pursuit of science without any thought , direct or indirect , of practical application is of the utmost value for the promotion of progress in the practical concerns of men is emphatically insisted on by Dr. Hale and other members of the Council . In a letter published some time ago in the New York Times , Dr. Hale dwells especially on this doctrine . And we note that where , in enumerating the purposes of the Council , he speaks of " the promotion of cooperation in research with the object of securing increased efficiency , " he adds the important proviso that in the pursuit of this there must be " careful avoidance of any hampering control or interference with individual freedom and initiative . " If the spirit manifested in this and other expressions of the attitude of the Council continues to be maintained , men who prize pure science for its own sake will have no need to fear that through over-zeal for " results " the promoters of coOperation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncalculating devotion an injury which might go far to counterbalance the gains obtained by increased systematization . These gains , great as they unquestionably may be made , are more or less calculable ; what is utterly incalculable is the potentiality of unhampered individual thought and endeavor , inspired by a passionate ardor for the discovery of truth , and directed into those channels which the particular bent of their mind determines for a few rare and " divinely gifted " men In each generation . SHORTENING THE SHORT STORY . At the beginning of the third year of the great war ( the future historian of American literature will write ) , the impress of the world conflict upon the short story , the most truly national of American literary forms , became peculiarly marked . The war had brought a transmutation of values in nearly every field of life . It brought an immense change in magazine fiction . The short story grew more condensed , more vigorous , more dramatic . This was inevitable in an age which had made a mockery of thought and feeling and emphasized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessity of competing against the highly compressed bulletins of the War Offices . A. reading public sated with victories told in a single paragraph and revolutions announced in a parenthesis naturally insisted upon the same economy of speech in their imaginative literature . Indirectly , too , the great war forced the literary current into the same channel . The great lesson of the war for America was , of course , efficiency . It was natural that the new efficiency should turn to the elimination of false motions , the conservation of raw material , and the nursing of brain expenditure in one of our principal industries , the manufacture of the short story . In scarcely any other field can the student of to-day re-create , from internal evidence , the psychological effects of the European conflict . Thus the future historian . Actually , it is a case of white paper . It is like the Roman Empire which did not fall because of spiritual decadence , but on account of malaria . It is like Waterloo , which was not lost because all the forces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of sorts on June 18 , 1815 . In the editorial offices the order of the day is to go short on the short story because of the white-paper famine . The trained author will remember conditions in the chemical market and please make his hero cut the Gordian knot with a splendid gesture of defiance , instead of hesitating between temptation and duty to the extent of a couple of pages . Ink has gone up 300 per cent . in two years , and neglected wives will kindly let their actions speak for their motives instead of describing them at length . Stereotyping material is way up ; consequently it would be a convenience if the people in the story would Just say things instead of breathing them or flashing them or tentatively suggesting them , as they have been in the habit of doing . The compositors are all demanding higher wages , and it would help if the death-grapple between young Norman Winthrop from Harvard and Alkali Bill , on the edge of the Grand Cafion , only went to three rounds . Many things counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply is falling off , the demand is increasing . Governments are publishing tons of true accounts of the origins of the war . Congressmen are up for reelection , and the Congressional Record is circulating like mad . Traction companies and traction strikers are constantly writing open letters to the public ; also milk companies , railway companies , and the producers of poor shows on Broadway . Thrift must be practiced somewhere . Why not in the short story , which , by becoming shorter , will only be living up to its ideal ? In other words , less pulp and more red blood , the latter being a commodity in which we are entirely independent of Germany . Neither must we look to Germany for ginger and " pep , " which have always been in high demand and which must now be utilized in greater quantities than ever . Times will be hard for the literary highbrow , a species notoriously addicted to a copious diet of white paper . Times will be good for literary experts in the " nun 1.11 ? with which PT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which it should end . New efficiency-securing devices will no doubt be forthcoming . The censor would be useful if he could be acclimatized . At first sight the censor would only seem to be a wastrel with white paper . He leaves gaping blanks on the front page of the principal European newspapers ; but the shrewd editor will know how to make use of him . Take , for instance , a fascinating article on the " Crisis in the Near East " in the Paris Temps . It begins : " Petty diplomacy is no more successful than petty warfare . " Then come eight inches of white space . Then the driving home of the argument : " This can not be repeated too often ! " So in the magazine story : " Geraldine looked straight past him and said He dashed from the room in an agony of frustration . " Half an inch of white paper ostensibly wasted ; actually a couple of pages saved . But the American Miinsterberg of the future will find in the short story as it began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the psychic reactions of the American people to the war in Europe . It will be discovered that about this time a new spirit and a new Weltanschauung were born in America .
