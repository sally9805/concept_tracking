txt The message of the President transmitting to Congress the annual report of the Postmaster General reviews changes , accomplished and advised , which affect directly or indirectly whoever buys postage stamps . Announcement is made of the arrangements for the extension of the postal savings bank facilities to 40,000 fourth-class offices in addition to the 7,500 Presidential offices now operating these aids to thrift . The President and the Postmaster General agree In advising the adoption of a parcels pose This has been included in the Post Office Appropriation bill to be reported next week . On the other - hand , two proposals are negatived . The commission on second-class rates disapproves the extension of the " free-In-county " privilege which the Postmaster General suggested , and the President expresses his disapproval of the Governmental operation of telegraphs . This is the suggestion which the Postmaster General announced some time ago that he " would submit to Congress . " He submitted it to the President first , of course , and it reaches Congress in a hobble skirt . The President declares that he prefers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that he objects " thus greatly to increase the body of public servants . " This is a strong position , but there are other considerations to the same effect . The telegraph service is not of universal use , like the mails . It is fight , therefore , that those who use the telegraphs should support them . It is a. perversion of government to furnish facilities to some at the expense of others , and that is the effect of all the precedents cited in support of an idea more paternal than American . The most conspicuous example is that of England , where the aggregated deficits through a series of years are about $175,000,000 , although the undertaking is charged with interest on less than one-third of the capital sunk . The Chancellor of the Exchequer has said that the business could be made economically solvent by raising the rates , but there 's the rub , How can rates be raised by votes ? On the other hand , wages can be raised by Votes , and the Government is in terror of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be impracticable In this country to administer the telegraphs without the telephones . To . gether they would require , say , two billions or more , as estimated by experts . A deficit on the British precedents on this larger scale would not be unworthy attention , even in a billion-dollar country . These considerations are heightened by the difficulties confronted by the Commission which has considered second-class rates in attempting to find the cost of the service . It may be doubted that anybody could have attacked the problem more zealously or intelligently , but the Commission finds that the data are not available for precision . According to its best judgment , the third and fourth class fates earn a small profit , and the letter , or first-class rate , earns a revenue one and one-half times the cost of service . The second-class matter constitutes 05 per cent . of the mails , and earns 5 per cent . of the revenue . The President agrees with the Commission that these facts warrant an increase of rate , but the increase advised is less than originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of quadrupled . It is evident that the newspapers and magazines must bear the additional cost themselves , since it is not transferable , to subscribers . On the other hand , it is an equitable and universal burden . These classes of publications are neither asking nor are entitled to ask a subsidy for the business , nor is it just that the cost of carriage should be borne by the profitable portions of the malls . The increased rates will be a charge against profits and the businesses will not be conduct , d unless there are profits to bear the ' rates which it is fair to charge . It , is worth remarking that on an ; aggregate of receipts of $237,869,000 there remains a profit of 219,118. is not an unprecedented occurrence , but it is a happy contrast with the deficit of $17,479,770 in 1909 . As there has been a gain of thirty millions in revenue , the , : deficit has been earned . by good , , , , bpsiness and good management rather than by starving the accommodations . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even larger plans are under way . This is as the people would have it . They do not care to have the Post Office run for profit , and like to have their accommodations increased as the earnings justify .
