Miss Mary E. of the University of Chicago settlement , who spoke on " Fire ProtecUon in Factories , " urged that the Chicago tire department be charged with the duty of Inspection of all buildings . The speaker advocated the creation of a " bureau of fire prevention " in the fire department , with power to prosecute all violations of the Inspection laws and ordinances . Names Committee to Push Demands . A committee of six members of the league was appointed to call on the mayor and present the league 's demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss those on the committee are Miss Emma Steghagen and Miss .

" Twenty-live girls lost their lives In the Newark fire and 145 persons died In the Triangle shirtivais ? factory fire In New York . " Many victims of these disasters were made Invalids for life . I want you to dwell on that . I do n't think we ever learned how many ware made invalids in the Fish fire here In Chicago . It Is hard enough to be an Invalid when you have plenty of money . But think of girls who work for a living and have others dependent upon them . " I do n't like to be solemn , and I dislike to relate harrowing details , but this is a condition that requires solemnity , and Chicago , yes , the whole country , ought to be harrowed with the terrible details of these disasters . " With factory Inspection and Are protection these terrible fires happened . Who Is to blame ? Well , I am to blame , for one . We are all to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the laws . Find - the Faults After Disasters , " We have factory inspection laws In Illinois , but we allow the machinery to go on and then the fire comes After the lives are lost we become hysterical and demand protection . After the damage is done we find that the Are escapes were of inferior quality aril access to the escapes was blocked with merchandise . " I noticed that after the New York factory fire the Chicago building commissioner suddenly discovered 4,000 violations of the the escape laws in Chicago factories and buildings . I know that Factory Inspector Davies has n't enough inspectors to do the work . " The fire department should do the inspecting . Officials of the fire department . know where the danger is . There should be a bureau of fire prevention and the fire department should have power to prosecute all violations . Compares America and Europe . " I have talked with city firemen who told me that there are buildings In the city where women and girls are working that practically are without protection in case of tire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wooden , and inadequate fire escapes . " Wo Must get quick action In this matter . The Women 's Trade Union league intends to Insist on enforcement of the law . How can we rest and sleep when such conditions exist In our city ? The annual fire loss per capita In American cities Is *2.30 . In Europe It is 93 cents . " It seems that we have to put everything Into money In America or we would n't understand it . I object to reducing this sort of thing to a money basis . There must be a human economy , as well as a dollar economy . But in Europe they make their good showing because they devote their efforts to preventing , fires , while in A merica the basis is that of extinguishing Rtes . " When the Iroquois fire took place we vowed in that solemn moment that such a disaster must not happen again . But we let it go and then allowed Mr. Fish to burn up a lot of people . Now . I ask you to help us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us insist on protection . "
