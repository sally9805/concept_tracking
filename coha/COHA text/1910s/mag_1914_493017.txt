The Reformer WHILE the reformer is earnestly discussing his " social responsibilities " and his " national cooperation " and his " sound and fundamental political ideas , " it is a bit difficult for him to keep his ear to the ground . Through some friend he may , however , catch an echo of what other people are saying . They will be saying very little about sound and fundamental political ideas , and a great deal about whether he is sincere , whether he is sane , and what there is in it for him . The reformer will feel as if somebody had struck his ugly fist through a painting , or walked whistling into a shrine . Such questions are not asked in a kindly world . Yet for some reason people do continue to ask them . They come into the parlor with their muddy feet and cast ruffian 's doubt upon the assumptions of public virtue . These are the people who are not answered when the reformer tells them he feels sincere , regards himself as saner than most , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered by turning the tables with some elaborate question about what is sincerity , what is sanity , where is the hairline which divides the normal from the abnormal , and so on . The reformer seems to be doing things other people do n't do , to be meddling and fussing and worrying about things others let alone . All this poking the head into other people 's kitchens , this trying to scrub other people 's children , this trying to make life miserable for Charlie Murphy , or squeeze a few cents more in girls ' wages out of a dry-goods store manager ? to call all this " public spirit " and " civic virtue " is like saying abracadabra to the moon . It explains nothing . Yet the reformer needs explaining . He does n't seem to be an ordinary person , yet he is n't very wonderful or very interesting . The easiest way to explain him is to say that he has an ax to grind , or to ignore him as a man not quite like other men . That , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is his detachment from this context which makes people sniff at the reformer . That is why people who believe in votes for women do n't dare to be vegetarians , why Lyman Abbot is proud to confess that he drinks wine , why efficiency experts have to be a little absent-minded , why clergymen and professors swear in public . But what the reformer tries to do for himself by these amiable vices the public does for him much more radically by asking what there is in it for him . After that question the reformer no longer looks like the marble-hearted creature at banquets who is known as a public-spirited citizen . He is back on the plane of common humanity , where people wish him to be , where people , from their knowledge of the reformers they do n't like , know that he ought to be . For they have not forgotten that the noisy municipal reformer of a few years ago is now an important person in the administration of their town , and much less noisy than he used to be . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a mine , who wears good clothes , hobnobs with interesting people , makes speeches to crowds who glorify him , and is displayed in the newspapers . Perhaps they think of a rich man who gives lavishly , but gives without giving , or uses his generosity to thrust himself into the private lives of his pensioners . They may speak of a suffragist , and point out that she is bored and unhappy with her husband ; they remark that some other suffragist became quiet when she married . They grin at the proposal to enfranchise women . They are not charitable in their public judgment . They do n't move from imposing concept to imposing concept , from immense assumptions to abstract goals . It is only a small group of professional thinkers and their immediate followers who discuss the problems of human life in a language which bears no real resemblance to the speech of men . But from this group people derive the idea that the more a man sets out to serve humanity the further he detaches himself from it . It is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow pain to high-spirited people , this group with its brown journals and its gray annals , its discreet public conferences , its illusion that charters , institutions , legal forms , and principles are the bread of life . Here truth hides behind abstract nouns , and one does n't ask such fine brutal questions as , " What is there in it for you ? " This rule of manners shieldsus from embarrassment ; from embarrassment like that which was created at a conference of the Church of England when some one asked how many present would keep their positions if they were offered better paid and pleasanter ones elsewhere . It avoids the bad quarter of an hour which would seize many a reformer if he asked himself , " Am I in this work because I believe in it , or do I believe in it because I am in it ? " But while discretion avoids embarrassment , it destroys reality . It creates the odious sense that it is one thing to live , and another to be interested in reform . The most honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer is that life is too highly charged to be handled without gloves . No discussion could be carried on if there were not a tacit agreement to moderate truth to prejudice , to cover explosive fact by non-conducting abstractions , to talk with polish , without offense , and with luminous calm about raw and unflattering facts . For the man to whom you blurt out a bitter truth to-day may be the man you have to work with to-morrow . What you feel to be the truth may rest on assumptions you can not prove . So only a few valiant people talk bluntly . They make some crushing observation , are shown to have been misinformed on a detail , and become what is called " discredited . " Responsible people talk gently of the dangerous things they know . When their responsibility is increased by a high degree of educations , the convenient refuge is technical language which might be full of meaning if enough people understood it . By all this dignity and reserve and tact an illusion of elegance and nobility is created which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of us feel when we are just sitting down to our first dinner party . He understands what Chesterton meant by saying that a yawn was a silent yell , and he pays at least a small human tribute to the " highbrow " by assuming that there is something in it for him . He is more just , nearer to the source of truth , than he would be by accepting the language of virtue and the spacious phrases by which men love to describe themselves . To be a reformer is not to have cast your skin and to have been seized by a grace which transforms . What is called public spirit is nothing but an occasional phase of people 's lives . It does not descend with enveloping solemnity upon a few individuals and distinguish them from the rest of mankind . Men are worried into reform , driven into it , lured into it , earn their living by it , gain fame in it , make a habit of it , and through it release their ambitions . On the whole , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service is no less great because it emerges not from the abstractions of the mind , but from the compromised interests and desires of human beings . If the world had to wait for a race of saints and vestal virgins it would have to wait too long . While public spirit and social responsibility are icy heights towards which the path is concealed by the barriers of income and deference and the pedant 's fear of being wrong , few people will scale them , few people will even look toward them . As a matter of fact , all these heights are a delusion ; the technicality and the timidity , the detachment and the reservations of thinkers and reformers are signs not that they have become more than human , but that they have lost the vitality and the courage which the earth exhales . The reformer does not differ in motive or character from the men who suspect him . His actions do not arise from a different source ; they are merely pointed sometimes to a different end . His selfishness , his hobbies , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than himself ; not always , not even most of the time . The public aspect of any person is only a fragment of his life . There are moments which come and go when passion is well directed , interest is informed , and imagination touched with fortunate insight . At these moments , perhaps , we who are fret and drudgery and preoccupation contribute something .
