The scene is the living room of a comfortable and fairly prosperous Middle Western farmhouse . At the right of the stage is a fireplace with a glowing fire in it . Beside the fire is a large armchair in which PRUDENCE is sitting . At her elbow is a small table with a lighted lamp , having a shade of green tin . At the left is a door going into other parts of the house ; at the back a door going outside . There is a larger table at the center of the room . There is also a lighted lamp on this table , but the back of the stage is in semidarkness . Near the outside door is a window , the curtains of which are drawn . The time is about one o'clock of a Christmas morning in the early seventies . As the curtain rises , an OLD MAN has just shut and bolted the outside door as if shutting someone out . He is partly dressed and carries a lighted candle in his hand . PRUDENCE Well , what did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if that 's any comfort to you . PRUDENCE It is a comfort to me . I do n't like folks coming to the door at this time of night . OLD MAN You might have stirred yourself to take a look at him . He was that cold I could hear his teeth chatter . PRUDENCE What was he like ? p. 3 OLD MAN Youngish , I 'd say , with thin cheeks and a yellow beard . But I never seen such old-looking eyes as he had . PRUDENCE Go to bed , Uncle . OLD MAN Both his hands were bandaged . I could see the blood on ' em . PRUDENCE Well , what of it ? We ca n't be feeding every beggar that comes to the house . OLD MAN ( at the window ) : He ai n't turned the willows at the bend of the road . I could holler to him yet . PRUDENCE Go back to bed , I tell you , and let me read my Bible till Peter comes in . OLD MAN ( going toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prudence Steele . You 've set me thinking again . PRUDENCE Hush your mouth , and go to bed . OLD MAN Aye , aye , that 's it ! " To them that hath shall be given , and from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath . " If folks only knows enough to keep their mouths shut . PRUDENCE Now you 're blaspheming again . OLD MAN Maybe I am . But if I was to open my mouth now and tell what I can remember clear as day , would n't I be serving the Lord ? Answer me that . p. 4 PRUDENCE Nobody 'd believe you . OLD MAN I ai n't asking ' em to . If you and Peter can disremember what happened in this room , it ai n't for me to turn against my own kin . PRUDENCE Nothing happened in this room . OLD MAN Maybe I never seen thirty one-hundred-dollar bills counted out on this table . PRUDENCE Go to bed . OLD MAN I 'm going , I 'm going , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud pulled down and her that would n't spare a crust for a lame beggar on Christmas Eve losing a piece of money like that as a judgment . It would be as fine a judgment as ever I see in that there book of yours . ( The OLD MAN goes out chuckling . PRUDENCE follows him to the door , closes it , listens a moment , then blows out the lamp on the larger table and returns to the chair by the fire . She turns the pages of the book and then lays it face down on her knee and puts her hand over her eyes . The whole stage is now nearly dark , the only light coming from the lamp on the small table and from the fire in the grate . THE TRAMP opens the outside door and steps into the room . PRUDENCE stirs a little and the book drops from her lap , rousing her . She sits up and listens . THE TRAMP closes the door and shoots the bolt. ) p. 5 PRUDENCE You 're powerful late getting in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door to see if it is fast . ) PRUDENCE Hush your noise with the bolt , ca n't you ! You 'll be having Uncle down here again . TRAMP I 'll take my chance of that ! PRUDENCE What 's the matter with your voice ? TRAMP It 's the river fog sticking in my throat . PRUDENCE ( rising ) : Come here and let me look at you . I never heard you speak with that voice before . TRAMP ( stepping into the light ) : I dare say you never did ! PRUDENCE God save us ! I thought you were my husband ! TRAMP I gathered as much from your friendly greeting . ( He comes a step nearer . ) PRUDENCE Stand off or I 'll scream ! What do you want ? Who are you ? TRAMP What 's the need of your knowing ? PRUDENCE Tell me what you want and get out of my house . You need n't grin at me . I 'm not afraid of you ! p. 6 TRAMP You 're a bold woman ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving me lonesome half the nights of the year , and beggars prowling the dark like rats . TRAMP You 've a brave tongue in your head , and a kind voice , like a chilly wind on a tin church steeple . You 'll ask me to sit by your fire next and offer me a sup of something hot . PRUDENCE I 'll point you the door you came in by , and set the dog to your coattails . TRAMP Fine hospitality for the beginning of Christmas Day . PRUDENCE Who are you ? TRAMP Dust of the road , my dear , like any other man . Dust with a spark of fire in it . PRUDENCE You 're a tramp , by the looks of you-or worse . TRAMP A tramp is it ? That 's what you 'd call a gay fellow tramping the hills for the clean joy of sun and air ; keen snow in winter and the voice of the birds in the warm season . It 's what you 'd call the lifeless wretches , skulking from doorstep to doorstep for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither the one sort nor the other , but the name fits me well enough . PRUDENCE Whatever you call yourself , you 've got no business in a decent person 's house at the middle of the night . p. 7 TRAMP ( taking a pipe from his pocket and filling it ) : Is your husband like to be home soon ? PRUDENCE You 'll hear him at the door any minute now . If you 're thinking of robbery you 'd better be quick about it . There 's little enough to take . TRAMP ( lighting his pipe and seating himself on the edge of the large table ) : You can keep your hand off that trinket at your neck and make your mind easy about the spoons . I 'm a disreputable character , a prowler in the night , a be-trayer of friendship . I 've none of what you 'd call common decency . I 'd as leave eat your bread and kiss your hand and do you a dirty turn afterward as not , but-well-I 've a different whim . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got ! What 'll my husband say when he smells the smoke of your pipe ? TRAMP I 'm waiting to see him myself when he comes in . PRUDENCE Like as not he 'll break your head for your pains . TRAMP Aye , like as not . PRUDENCE You 've got gall to be sitting there swinging your feet . TRAMP I 'm thinking what I 'll say to you in the meantime . p. 8 PRUDENCE You wo n't be doing much thinking when he 's pounded you till the teeth ache in your jaws . TRAMP ( in a cold , sharp voice and speaking very slowly ) : Why did you send that other beggar away just now , Prudence Steele ? PRUDENCE So you know my name , do you ? TRAMP Yes ! It 's a cruel-sounding name , Prudence Steele , and you 've a cruel way of speaking and of looking at a poor man , my dear ! PRUDENCE You 're a fine hand at a compliment , Mr. Tramp . TRAMP Why did you send him away ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bandages on his hands and feet . PRUDENCE What 's that to you ? TRAMP I was standing in the road . I saw him knock at your door . I saw it open a little . I saw it close again . I saw him go away  --  just as I 've seen him go from thousands of other doors . PRUDENCE He must be a friend of yours . TRAMP No . He was one once . Now he 's a creditor . PRUDENCE By the looks of it , he 'll have a hard time getting his money . p. 9 TRAMP Money 's easy to find  --  sometimes too easy . Now if you 'd care to feel in my pockets- ( He jingles coins in his pockets . ) PRUDENCE Well , pay him then , and keep him from pestering other folks . TRAMP One is n't always minded to pay one 's debts . And sometimes it 's not so easy as you 'd think . Only one day of the year I walk the same road with him . I follow him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at your gate just now and offered it . He turned aside his face . Would you like to see the coins ? ( Holding out his hand with coins . ) You must . Thirty pieces of silver coined in the Roman mint at Jerusalem . ( Faint blue light now illumines the face of THE TRAMP and becomes brighter as the scene goes on . ) PRUDENCE ( fascinated , looking at the money ) : You frighten me . What are those stains ? TRAMP Blood , my dear ! It 's blood money . PRUDENCE Whose blood ? TRAMP The man 's who knocked at your door . PRUDENCE What did he want ? TRAMP He came to give  --  not to ask . p. 10 PRUDENCE What beggar would be going about the country giving something away ? TRAMP Yes , Prudence Steele , what beggar would be doing that ? It 's a riddle for you to read . PRUDENCE And I suppose now you 've got something to give me ! TRAMP Yes , something you wo n't be likely to take . PRUDENCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheapest thing I know . TRAMP Sit down . ( PRUDENCE sits down . ) Where the man with the wounded hands knocks once , he knocks again . Wherever he 's turned away , I find the door unlatched . But open the door to him , and I stand in the road outside  --  I 'm glad ! Oh , I 'm a person of strange contradictions  --  like any other man . You do n't understand me . PRUDENCE No . TRAMP No matter ! When he knocks again , let him come in . PRUDENCE What do you mean ? TRAMP Let him come in , I tell you , and save the joy of life in your heart . ( There is a stamping outside and the door is shaken . ) PETER ( outside ) : Hi ! Open the door ! Prudence , I say ! Wake up and open the door ! p. 11 PRUDENCE ( starting and passing her hands across her eyes ) : It 's Peter . It 's my husband . TRAMP Open the door for him ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters and she clings to him , half hysterical . THE TRAMP remains seated on the larger table , but the light fades from his face . ) PRUDENCE Peter  --  oh , Peter , Peter ! PETER What 's biting you ? Let go my arm , woman ! Are you trying to claw the coat off me ? PRUDENCE Send him away ! Send him away ! Send him away ! PETER Take your hands off me . PRUDENCE Send him away ! PETER Send who away ? PRUDENCE That man ! That man over there ! I 'm afraid of him ! PETER What man ? PRUDENCE He came in without knocking . I thought it was you ! He 's terrible  --  he 's crazy ! Look at his eyes ! Send him away ! PETER Go on ! Do n't be a fool . There 's nobody here ! PRUDENCE Over there ! He was standing by the table . The table over there  --  He 's gone ! ( They both move across the room , but THE TRAMP has disappeared in the darkness. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a nightmare . You 've been worrying again . You 'd no call to sit up waiting for me . There 's been nobody here . PRUDENCE I could have taken my solemn oath ! PETER ( roughly ) : You 'll take no oaths except them I tell you to . Go to bed ! PRUDENCE Where 've you been ? PETER Up to the church . I stayed to a vestry meeting . I walked home slow . PRUDENCE You 've decided what we 're going to do ? PETER Go to bed and let me think . I 'll tell you in the morning . ( PRUDENCE moves toward the inside door . PETER calls her back . ) PETER Look here ! You 'll keep your mouth shut ? You 'll stick to that ? PRUDENCE Yes . ( She makes a move as if she were coming back to say something . ) PETER Get out of here and let me alone . ( He sits down in the chair by the fire and puts his face in his hands . PRUDENCE goes out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is it easy to think of perjury and theft on Christmas morning ? p. 13 PETER God ! Who 's talking to me ! TRAMP A greater rogue than yourself . PETER ( rising ) : I see you now , confound you ! where were you hiding when I came in ? TRAMP No matter ! PETER So , my wife was n't dreaming , eh ! TRAMP No more than you are . PETER You frightened her , eh ! I 'll make short work of you . ( He begins rolling up his sleeves . ) TRAMP I only gave her a little advice . PETER I 'll give you something else ! ( He moves toward THE TRAMP . ) TRAMP ( coolly ) : Sit down ! PETER Get out of here with your advice ! Get out , I tell you , before I kick you out . TRAMP ( more harshly but without moving ) : Sit down . PETER You ca n't frighten me with your talk . I 'm an honest man , I tell you . TRAMP So was I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , damn you ? p. 14 TRAMP " For there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed , neither hid that shall not be known . " PETER ( with a sigh of relief ) : Oh , I see now . You 're only a traveling preacher . TRAMP No , but I 've traveled much and worn the cloth in my time . PETER I 'm dashed if I see what you 're driving at ! TRAMP You will presently . PETER I wo n't listen to you . TRAMP You know what 's coming . PETER How should I know what 's coming ? I 'll  --  I 'll  --  TRAMP You 'll listen , Peter Steele , because I 'm going to tell you something about yourself and you 'll know it for the truth . PETER If  --  if someone sent you here to pump me , you 'd better be off , or I 'll have the law on you both . TRAMP You had a friend , Peter Steele , and you loved him . He 'd often left his affairs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trusted you . PETER And why would n't anybody trust me ? I 've been an honest man , I tell you . TRAMP He came to you in this room . It was the spring the war began . He had enlisted in a company . Before he left you he brought you money , money to keep for his boy . p. 15 PETER It 's a lie ! I tell you , it 's a damned lie ! What right 's the boy got to think his father gave me money to keep for him ? He ai n't got a receipt , has he ? It ai n't shown in the accounts , is it ? TRAMP No , Peter Steele , the boy ca n't show a receipt and the entry 's not to be found in the accounts . PETER By what token do you think a man would be fool enough to leave money lying around loose like that ? TRAMP By the token that he trusted you . PETER I never had it ! I tell you I never had it ! What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beating in the road . Your friend was in his captain 's uniform . His sword lay on the table by the door ; his cloak over the back of that chair . You sat here . He stood across the table from you . Your wife sat where you 're sitting now ; her uncle over there by the window . PETER Who told you all that ? What tricks are you trying to play on me ? TRAMP Your friend laid the money on this table ; thirty one-hundred-dollar bills . He said to you , " Peter , I want to leave this money with you . In case I do n't come back , I 'd rather my boy did n't count on anything at all when he makes his start . I 've fixed things safe for him till he can earn his keep . This is something extra , a nest egg for him , when he 's twenty-one . " Then he shook you by the hand . As he went down the path , the drums stopped beating , and when the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! p. 16 PETER God , how did you know that ? TRAMP Oh , you meant to keep faith , Peter Steele , but you never entered the three thousand dollars in your accounts . Well , he never came back . You read his mane in the lists . It set you thinking about the boy and his money . Years went by . The boy began to work and earn his keep . You watched him grow up and wondered if he guessed . Last week , you remembered that your debt fell due on the day after Christmas . Then you sat down to figure interest . You 'd used the money well and you tried a just rate . The total startled you . Then you tried three per cent ; still too much ! Then you sat quiet and the money whispered to you , " Why give me up at all ? No one can prove you ever had me . " PETER And they ca n't prove it ! My wife and her uncle can swear they never saw it paid . TRAMP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . TRAMP None . PETER No . I do n't know who you all this , but if you 're trying to blackmail me , there 's the door , and be damned ! TRAMP I 'll not trouble you again , whatever decision you come to . PETER Then what in hell did you come here for ? Answer me that ! p. 17 TRAMP To advise you to give the boy his money of your own free will . PETER Ha , ha ! Anything else ? TRAMP No . PETER Who in the devil are you , stranger ? TRAMP Come closer ! PETER I can see you well enough from here . TRAMP Come here and look at me . Have you ever seen me before ? PETER No , thank heaven ! I never have . TRAMP Look in my eyes . ( PETER moves toward him as if dazed . ) PETER They 're like the eyes of a cat ! There 's fire in ' em . TRAMP Flame from a sunset under Calvary . Look at my throat ! PETER ( shrinking away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man  --  TRAMP I hanged myself to a dead tree on a stony hillside . Listen ! ( He jingles the money in his pocket . ) PETER It 's the sound of money ! TRAMP Thirty pieces of silver , coined in the Roman mint at Jerusalem ; the price of my soul , that 's walked the evil edge of the world for nineteen centuries . p. 18 PETER In God 's name , tell me who you are ! TRAMP The one being that knows best the pricelese value of the thing you 're so ready to sell  --  Judas of Kerioth . ( He advances toward PETER , who sinks into the chair by the fire , cowering away from him . ) PETER Let me alone , I say ! Let me alone ! TRAMP You 'd been an honest man , Peter Steele , and the sun had warmed you and the birds piped to you when you plowed the fields . You 'd looked against the faces of red hills when dawn was new , and strained your eyes across blue valleys at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roads and children turned to you as you passed , till a little while ago . What came over you that you 'd put the joy of living in pawn for thirty pieces of money ? PETER Let me be ! I 've become a hard man ; and money 's a big thing in the world . What 's the piping of birds to me ? Leave me alone and let me sell my soul if I like ! It 's mine to sell ! TRAMP Aye ! It 's yours to sell . To sell over and over , if you like . There 's money to be got for it , more than the first price you take , and pride , and ease of body , and fear of men ! But it is n't only your soul you sell , Peter Steele , and nothing you get will compare with that which goes out of you when the first payment clinks in your hand . p. 19 PETER Let me be ! Let me be ! TRAMP You 'll miss the joy of small things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes of watching the fall of yellow leaves . You 'll take no comfort in the sound of a woman 's singing , or the laughing of a child , or the crackling of a fire in the grate . PETER I was never a hand at noticing such things . TRAMP No , but an honest man shares all the common gifts of God . He feels and is grateful without knowing how or why . He seldom knows the joy of it all , till he 's lost the power of feeling . PETER Let me be . TRAMP You 'll walk the sunshiny roads and have only the dust of them in your throat . You 'll see little lakes lying in the bosom of the hills , like purple wine in cups of green jade , and have only the pain of daylight in your eyes . You 'll lie down to sleep with the crystal stars blinking at you , and have only the empty blackness of night in your heart . I know how it will be with you , Peter Steele . PETER What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money of your own free will . PETER What interest have you got in seeing me go straight ? Whose work are you doing ? p. 20 TRAMP ( slowly ) : It 's one thing to die in a splendid agony and save the world . It 's another to drag the weight of a name like mine from century to century ; to live on and on , and suffer every pain of death ; to save a man here and a man there only to balance my own long account ; to die , to be forgotten . PETER To balance your long account ? TRAMP Turn you from the thing you 're about to do , and I toss a grain of dust into the scales . There 's a heavy weight to be balanced , Peter Steele , and it 's only one day of the year I 'm free to search . PETER Let me be . TRAMP Would you rob me , too ? PETER ( putting his hand to his head ) : Let me think , I tell you ! Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRUDENCE enters , dressed in a wrapper and carrying a small lamp . As the light illuminates that side of the room , the glow fades on THE TRAMP 'S face and he disappears . PETER sits with his head in his hands , just as PRUDENCE had left him . ) PRUDENCE Peter , Peter , are you asleep ? PETER ( starting ) : Eh ? No. p. 21 PRUDENCE Why have n't you come to bed ? It 's near daylight . PETER I 've been thinking , Prudence  --  I 've been thinking . PRUDENCE About  --  about ? PETER Say it . I 've been thinking of perjury and theft on Christmas morning . I 've been thinking of selling my soul for thirty pieces of money . ( He rises . ) But , thank God , I have n't sold it yet . PRUDENCE ( going to him ) : Oh , Peter ! Peter ! PETER The boy will get his money on the nail . I 'm an honest man , Prudence . I 'm an honest man , I tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm glad ! PETER Every penny he 'll get and interest . Fair interest ! PRUDENCE It 's a great deal of money , but I 'm glad ! PETER Little enough to give for keeping the joy of living in your heart on Christmas Day . PRUDENCE I want to tell you something . I could n't sleep , either . Oh , Peter , I could n't sleep . PETER You 've been thinking of it , too . PRUDENCE Not about the money . There was a lame man here just before you came in . I sent him away . It worries me , Peter . I 'm sorry I did n't let him in . Uncle saw him . He 'd been hurt . His feet and hands were bandaged . I thought  --  I thought perhaps  --  I feel as if he 'd stopped somewhere near the house . p. 22 PETER Which way did he go ? PRUDENCE Toward the willows at the bend of the road . PETER ( reaching for his hat and coat ) : Like as not he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outside door . ) PRUDENCE Where are you going ? PETER To find him and fetch him back . We ca n't let him freeze . ( They go together to the outside door and open it . It is morning outside . ) PETER It 's morning already . PRUDENCE Did you ever see such a dawn on the snow ? PETER Never in my life . ( He kisses her and goes out . ) PRUDENCE ( calling after him )
