WE looked back always on our first semester 's teaching in the University of California as one hectic term . The red-letter event of that term was when , after about two months of teaching , President Wheeler rang up one evening about seven , and said , ' I thought I should like the pleasure of telling you personally , though you will receive official notice in the morning , that you have been made an assistant professor . We expected you to make good , but we slid not expect you to make good to such a degree quite so soon . ' The second term in California had just got well under way , when Carl was offered the position of Executive Secretary in the Immigration and Housing Commission of the state . I remember so well the night that he came home about midnight and told me . I am afraid the financial end would have determined us in this case , even if the work itself had small appeal ? which , however , was not the case . The salary offered was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were $2000 in debt from our European trip , and saw no earthly chance of ever paying it out of our University salary . We figured that we could be square with the world in one year on a $4000 salary , and that after that we need never be swayed by financial considerations again . So Carl accepted the new job . It was the wise thing to do anyway , as matters turned out . It threw him into direct contact for the first time with the migratory laborer and the I.W.W. It also gave him his first bent in the direction of labor-psychology , which was destined to become his intellectual passion , and he was fired with a zeal that never left him , to see that there should be less unhappiness and inequality in the world . The most dramatic incident during his connection with the Commission was the famous Ford and Suhr case , the riot in the Wheatland hop-fields , which Carl was deputized to investigate for the federal government . He wrote an account of this later for the Survey , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' for the Quarterly Journal of Economies , in November , 1915 . Also he did a big piece of work in his clean-up of camps all over California , and in awakening , through countless talks up and down the state , some understanding of the I.W.W. and his problem . ( Not but what it seems now to have been almost forgotten . ) As the phrase went , ' Carleton Parker put the migratory on the map . ' He was high ace with the Wobbly for a while . They invited him to their Jungles , they carved him presents in jail . I remember a talk he gave on some phase of the California labor-problem one Sunday night at the Congregational Church in Oakland . The last three rows were filled with unshaven hoboes , who filed up afterwards , to the evident distress of the clean regular churchgoers , to clasp his hand . They withdrew their allegiance after a time , which naturally in no way lessened Carl 's scientific interest in them . A paper hostile to his attitude on the I.W.W. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protraying him as a double-faced individual , who feigned an interest in the under-dog really to undo him , as he was at heart and pocketbook a capitalist , being the possessor of an independent income of $150,000 a year ! Some I.W.W. 's took this up and convinced a large meeting that he was really trying to sell them out . It is not only the rich who are fickle . Some of them remained his firm friends always , however . Carl was no diplomat in any sense of the word ? particularly , no political diplomat . It is a wonder the Immigration and Housing Commission stood behind him as long as it did . He grew rabid at every political appointment made , which in his eyes hampered his work . It was evident that he was not tactful , so they felt , to various members of the Commission . It all got so that it galled him terribly , and after much consultation at home , he handed in his resignation . During the first term of his secretaryship , from October to December , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May , he had a seminar only , as I remember . From August on , he gave no University work at all ; so , on asking to have his resignation from the Commission take effect immediately , he had at once to find something to do to support his family . This was October , 1914 , after just one year as Executive Secretary- . We were over in Contra Costa County then , on a little ranch of my father 's . Berkeley socially had come to be too much of a strain ; and , too , we wanted the blessed sons to have a real country experience . Ten months we were there . Three days after Carl resigned , he was on his way to Phoenix , Arizona , as United States Government investigator of the labor situation there . He thereby added to his first-hand stock of labor knowledge , made a firm friend of Governor Hunt , ? he was especially interested in his prison policy , ? and in those few weeks was the richer by one more of the really intimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was that first summer back in Berkeley , the year before the June-Bug was born , when Carl was teaching in Summer School , that we had our definite enthusiasm over labor-psychology aroused . Will Ogburn , who also was teaching at Summer School that year , and whose lectures I attended , introduced us to Hart 's Psychology of Insanity , McDougall 's Social Psychology , several books by Freud , etc . I remember Carl 's seminar the following spring ? his last seminar at the University of California . He had started with nine seminar students three years before and now there were thirty-three . They were such a superior picked lot , ? some seniors , mostly graduates , ? that he felt there was no one he could ask to stay out . I visited it all the term and am sure that at no other place on the campus could quite such heated and excited discussions have been heard ? Carl merely sitting at the head of the table , directing here , leading there . The general subject was Labor Problems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such books as Hart 's Psychology of Insanity , Keller 's Societal Evolution , Holt 's Freudian Wish , McDougall 's Social Psychology , ? two weeks to that , ? Lipmann 's Preface to Politics , etc. , etc. , and ending , as a concession to the idealists , with Royce 's Philosophy of Loyally . The seminar was too large really for intimate discussion ; so after a few weeks several of the boys asked Carl if they could have a little sub-seminar . It was a very rushed time for him , but he said that , if they would arrange all the details , he would save them Tuesday evenings . So every Tuesday night about a dozen boys climbed our hill to rediscuss the subject of the seminar of that afternoon , and everything else under the heavens ? and beyond . I laid out ham sandwiches or sausages or some edible dear to the male heart , and coffee to be warmed , and about midnight could be heard the sounds of banqueting from the kitchen . Three students told me on graduation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulus than anything that had ever come into their lives . About this time we had a friend come into our lives who was destined to mean great things to the Parkers ? Max Rosenberg . He had heard Carl lecture once or twice , and had met him through our good friend Dr. Brown , and a warm friendship had developed . The spring of 1910 we were somewhat tempted by a call to another university ? $1700 was really not a fortune to live on , and to make both ends meet and prepare for the June-Bug 's coming , Carl had to use every spare minute lecturing on the outside . It discouraged him , for he had no time left to read and study . So when a call came that appealed to us in several ways , besides paying a much larger salary , we seriously considered it . About then ' Uncle Max ' rang up from San Francisco and asked Carl , before answering the other university , to see him ; and an appointment was made for that afternoon . I was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure to call me up the minute he left Max ? we wondered so hard what he might mean . And what he did mean was the most wonderful idea that ever entered a friend 's head . He felt that Carl had a real message to give the world , and that he should write a book . He also realized that it was impossible to find time for a book under the circumstances . Therefore he proposed that Carl should take a year 's leave of absence and let Max finance him ? not only just finance him , but allow for a trip throughout the East , for Carl to get the inspiration of contact with other men in his field ; and enough withal , so that there should be no skimping anywhere , and that the little family at borne should have everything that they needed . It seemed to us something too wonderful to believe . I remember going back to that lunch table , after Carl had telephoned me only the broadest details , wondering if it were the same world . That Book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years ? the material to be in it changed continually , but always the longing to write , and no time , no hopes of any chance to do it . And the June-Bug coming , and more need for money ? hence more outside lectures than ever . I have no love for the University of California when I think of that $1700 . ( I quote from an article that came out in New York . It is an astounding fact which his University must explain , that he , with his great abilities as teacher and leader , his wide travel and experience and training , received from the University in his last year of service there a salary of $1700 ! The West does not repay commercial genius like that . ' ) For days after Max 's offer we hardly knew we were on earth . It was so very much the most wonderful thing that ever could have happened to us . Our friends had long before adopted the phrase ' just Parker luck , ' and here , if ever , was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ! This all meant , to get the fulness out of it , that Carl must make a trip of at least four months in the East . At first he planned to return in the middle of it and then go back again ; but somehow four months spent as we planned it out for him seemed so absolutely marvelous , ? an opportunity of a lifetime , ? that joy for him was greater in my soul than the dread of a separation . It was different from any other parting we had ever had . I was bound that I would not shed a single tear when I saw him off , even though it meant the longest time apart we had experienced . Three nights before he left , being a hit blue about things for all our fine talk , we prowled down our hillside and found our way to our first Charlie Chaplin film . We laughed until we cried ? we really did . So that night , seeing Carl off , we went over that Charlie Chaplin film in detail , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed all over again , and Carl went off laughing , and I waved good-bye laughing . Bless that Charlie Chaplin film ! It would not take much imagination to realize what that trip meant to Carl ? and through him to me . From the time he first felt the importance of the application of modern psychology to the study of economics , he became more and more intellectually isolated from his colleagues . They had no interest in , no sympathy for , no understanding of , what he was driving at . From the May when college closed , to October when he left for the East , he read prodigiously . He had a mind for assimilation ? he knew where to store every new piece of knowledge he acquired , and kept thereby an orderly brain . He read more than a book a week , ? everything that he could lay hands on in psychology , anthropology , biology , philosophy , psycho-analysis , ? every field that he felt contributed to his own growing conviction that orthodox economics had served its day . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep up with him by the merest skimming , ? and one or two others at most , there was no one who understood what he was driving at . As his reading and convictions grew , he waxed more and more indignant at the way in which economics was handled in his own University . He saw student after student having every ounce of intellectual curiosity ground out of him by a process of economic education that would stultify a genius . Any student who continued his economic studies did so in spite of the introductory work , and not because he had had one little spark of enthusiasm aroused in his soul . Carl would walk the floor with his hands in his pockets when kindred spirits ? especially students who had gone through the mill , and as seniors or graduates looked back outraged at certain courses they had had to flounder through ? brought up the subject of economics at the University of California . Ir Off he went then on his pilgrimage , ? his Research Magnificent , ? absolutely unknown to almost every man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop he made was at Columbia , Missouri , to see his idol Veblen . He quaked a bit beforehand , ? had heard Veblen might not see him , ? but the second letter from Missouri began , Just got in after thirteen hours with Veblen . It went wonderfully , and I am tickled to death . He 0 . K.s my idea entirely and said I could not go wrong . ' Then began the daily letters from New York , and every single letter ? not only from New York but from every other place he happened to be in : Baltimore , Philadelphia , Cambridge ? told of at least one intellectual Event ? with a capital E ? a day . After one week in New York he wrote , ' The trip has paid for itself now and I 'm dead eager to view the time when I begin my writing . ' Later , ' Just got in from a six-hour session with the most important group of employers in New York . I sat in on a meeting of the Building-Trades Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it ? awfully interesting ? the Board took me to dinner , and we talked labor stuff till ten-thirty . Gee , it was fine , and I got oceans of stuff . ' Next day , ' Had a remarkable visit with Dr. Gregory this morning . He is one of the greatest psychiatrists in New York , and up on balkings , business tension , and the mental effect of monotonous work . He was so worked up over my explanation of unrest ( a mental status ) through instinct balkings other than sex , that he asked if I would consider using his big psychopathic ward as a laboratory field for my own work . Then he dated me up for a luncheon , at which three of the biggest mental specialists in New York will be present , to talk over the manner in which psychiatry will aid my research ! I ca n't say how tickled I am over his attitude . ' Next letter : ' At ten reached Dr. Pierce Bailey 's , the big psychiatrist , and for an hour and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . Then I heat it to the New Republic offices and sat down to dinner with the staff , plus Robert Bruere , and the subject became , What is a labor policy ? ' He heard Roosevelt at the Ritz-Carlton . ' Then I watched that remarkable man wind the crowd almost around his finger . It was great , and pure psychology , and say , fool women and somefool men ; but T. R. went on blithely as if everyone was an intellectual giant . ' At nine-thirty I watched Dr. Campbell give a girl Freudian treatment for a suicide mania . She had been a worker in a straw-hat factory , and had a true industrial psychosis ? the kind I am looking for . ' Then came the Economic Convention at Columbus ? letters too full to begin to quote from them . ' I 'm simply having the time of my life . .. everyone is here . ' In a talk when he was asked to fill in the last minute , he put forward two arguments why trade-unions alone could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions through collective bargaining ? one , because they were numerically so few in contrast to the number of industrial workers ; and , two , because the reforms about to be demanded were technical , medical , and generally of scientific character , and skilled experts employed by the state would be necessary . ' Along in January he worked his thesis up in writing . ' Last night I read my paper to the Robinsons after the dinner , and they had Mr. and Mrs. John Dewey there . A most superb and grand discussion followed , the Deweys going home at eleven-thirty , and I stayed to talk to one A.m . I slept dreaming wildly of the discussion . . . then had an hour and a half with Dewey on certain moot points . That talk was even more superb and resultful to me , and I 'm just about ready to quit . . . . I need now to write and read . ' If only the time had been longer , ? if only the Book could have been finished , ? for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand words a day on it the following summer at Castle Crags , when the War Department called him into mediation work , and not another word did he ever find time to add to it . It stands now about one third done . I shall get that third ready for publication , together with some of his shorter articles . There have been many who have offered their services in completing the Book ; but the field is so new , Carl 's contribution so unique , that few men in the whole country understand the ground enough to be of service . It was not so much to be a book on Labor as on Labor-Psychology ? and that is almost an unexplored field . Three days after Carl started East , on his arrival in Seattle , President Suzzallo called him to the University of Washington , as Head of the Department of Economics and Dean of the College of Business Administration , his work to start in the following morning . It seemed an ideal opportunity . Between that Seattle call and his death there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , which wished Carl to be on their faculties . One smaller university held out the presidency to him . Besides this , there were nine jobs outside of university work that were offered him , all the way from managing a large mine to doing research in Europe . He had come into his own . In May we sold our loved hill-nest in Berkeley and started north , stopping for a three-months ' vacation ? our first real vacation since we had been married ? at Castle Crags , where , almost ten years before , we had spent the first five days of our honeymoon before going into southern Oregon . III Then , like a bolt from the blue , came the fateful telegram from Washington , D.C. ? labor difficulties in construction-work at Camp Lewis ? would he report there at once as government mediator . Oh ! the Book , the Book ? the Book that was to be finished without fail before the new work at the University of Washington began ! Perhaps he would be back in a week ! Surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed just enough for one week , and off he went . One week ? ! When , after four weeks , there was still no let up in his mediation duties , ? in fact , they in. creased , ? I packed up the family and we left for Seattle . His trip to Camp Lewis threw him at once into the midst of the lumber difficulties of the Northwest , which lasted for months . The big strike in the lumber industry was on when he arrived . He wrote , ' It is a strike to better conditions . The I.W.W. are only the dis . play feature . The main body of opinion is from a lot of unskilled workers who are sick of the filthy bunk-houses and rotten grub . ' He wrote later of a conference with the big lumbermen , and of how thee would not stay on the point but roared over the I.W.W. I told them that condemnation was not a solution , or businesslike , but what we wanted was a statement of how they were to open their plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I said I was a college man , not used to business , but if business men had as much trouble as this keeping to the real points involved , give me a faculty analysis . They laughed over this and got down to business , and in an hour lined up the affair in mighty good shape . ' Each letter would end , ' By three days at least , I should start back . I am getting frantic to be home . ' Home , for the Parkers , was always where we happened to be then . Castle Crags was as much home as any place had ever been . We had moved fourteen times in ten years ? of the eleven Christmases we had together , only two had been in the same place . There were times when home ' was the Pullman car . It made no difference . One of the strange new feelings I have to get used to is the way I now look at places to live in . It used to be that Carl and I , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , We could be perfectly happy in a place like that , could n't we ? Nothing makes any difference if we are together . ' But certain kinds of what we called ' cuddly ' houses used to make us catch our breath to think of the extra joy it would be living together tucked away in there . Now , when I pass a place that looks like that , I have to drop down some kind of a trap-door in my brain and not think at all until I get well by it . Labor conditions in the Northwest grew worse , strikes more general , and filially Carl wrote that he just must be indefinitely on the job . ' I am so homesick for you that I feel like packing up and coming . I literally feel terribly . But with all this feeling , I do n't see how I can . Not only have I been telegraphed to stay on the job , but the situation is growing steadily worse . Last night my proposal ? eight-hour day , nonpartisan complaint and adjustment board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down by the operators in Tacoma . President Suzzallo and I fought for six hours , but it went down . The whole situation is drifting into a state of incipient , sympathetic strikes . ' Later , " Phis is the most bull-headed affair , and I do n't think it is going to get anywhere . ' Later , ' Things are not going wonderfully in our mediation . Employers demanding everything and men granting much , but not that . ' Later , Each day brings a new crisis . Gee , labor is unrestful . . . and gee , the pigheadedness of bosses ! Human nature is sure one hundred per cent psychology . ' Also he wrote , referring to the general situation at the University and in the community , ' Am getting absolutely crazy with enthusiasm over my job here . . . It is too vigorous and resultful for words . ' Later , ' The mediation . . . blew up to-day at 4 P.M. and now a host of nice new strikes show on the horizon . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard shells . ' Again , ' Gee , I 'm learning . And talk about material for the Book ! ' An article appeared in one of the New York papers recently , entitled , ' How Carleton H. Parker Settled Strikes . ' It was under his leadership that , in less than a year , twenty-seven disputes which concerned government work in the Pacific Northwest were settled , and it was his method to lay the basis for permanent relief as he went along . . . . Parker 's contribution was in the method he used . . . . Labor leaders of all sorts would flock to him in a bitter , weltering mass , mouthing the set phrases of class-hatred they use so effectually in stirring up trouble . They would state their case . And Parker would quietly deduce the irritation points that seemed to stand out in the jumbled testimony . Then it would be almost laughable to the observer to hear the employer 's side of the case . Invariably it was just as bitter , just as unreasoning , and just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the workers . Parker would endeavor to find , in all this heap of words , the irritation points of the other side .. . But when a study was finished , his diagnosis made , and his prescription of treatment completed , Parker always insisted on carrying it straight to the workers . And he did not just tell them results . He often took several hours , sometimes several meetings of several hours each . In these meetings he would go over every detail of his method , from start to finish , explaining , answering questions , meeting objections with reason . And he always won them over . But , of course , it must be said that he had a tremendously compelling personality that carried him far . In one of Carl 's letters from Seattle he had written , ' The Atlantic Monthly wants me to write an article on the I.W.W. ! ! ' So the first piece of work he had to do after we got settled was that . We were tremendously excited , and never got over chuckling at some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would feel outraged at the Atlantic Monthly stooping to print stuff by that young radical . And on such a subject ! How we tore at the end to get the article off on time ! The stenographer from the University came about two one Sundaynfternoon . I sat on the floor up in the guest-room and read the manuscript to her , while she typed it off . Carl would rush down more copy from his study on the third floor , and I 'd go over it while Miss Van Doren went over what she had typed . Then the reading would begin again . We hated to stop for supper , all three of us were so excited to get the job done . It had to be at the post-office that night by eleven , to arrive in Boston when promised . At ten-thirty it was in the envelope , three limp people tore for the car , we put Miss Van Doren on , ? she was to mail the article on her way home , ? and Carl and I , knowing this was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routed out a sleepy drugstore clerk and ate the remains of his Sunday ice-cream supply . I can never express how grateful I am that that article was written and published before Carl died . The influence of it ramified in many and the most unexpected directions . I am still hearing of it . We expected condemnation at the time . There probably was plenty of it , but only one condemner wrote . On the other hand , letters streamed in by the score , from friends and strangers , bearing the general message , ' God bless you for it ! ' I am reminded here of a little incident that took place just at this time . An I.W.W. was to come out to have dinner with us ? some other friends , faculty people , also were to be there . About noon the telephone rang . Carl went . A rich Irish brogue announced , ' R ? ca n't come to your party tonight . ' Why is that ? ' He 's pinched . An ' he wants t ' know , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read while he 's in jail . ' And also , I am forever grateful that Carl had his experience at the University of Washington before he died , He left the University of California a young assistant professor , just one re . bellious morsel in a huge machine . He found himself in Washington , not only head of the Department of Economics and Dean of the College of Commerce and a power on the campus , but a power in the community as well . He was working under a president who backed him in everything to the last ditch , who was keenly interested in every ambition he had for making a big thing of his work . He at last could see Introductory Economics given as he wanted to have it given ? realizing at the same time that his plans were in the nature of an experiment . The two textbooks used the first semester were McDougall 's Social Psychology and Wallas 's Great Society . During part of the time he pinned the front page of the morning newspaper on the blackboard , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very day . - His theory of education was that the first step in any subject was to awaken a keen interest and curiosity in the student : for that reason he felt that pure theory in economics was too difficult for any but seniors or graduates  --  given too soon , it tended only to discourage . He allowed no note-taking in any of his courses , insisted on discussion by the class no matter how large it was , planned to do away with written examinations as a test of scholarship , substituting instead a short oral disussion with each student individually , grading them passed ' and ' not pass-A . ' As it was , owing to the pressure of government work , he had to resort to written tests . The proportion of first sections in the final examination , which was difficult , was so large that Carl was sure the reader must have marked too leniently and looked over the papers himself . His results were the same as the reader 's , and he felt that they could justifiably be used as some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in the subject , you can not keep him from doing good work . Besides being of real influence on the campus , he had the respect and confidence of the business world , both labor and capital , and in addition he stood as the representative of the government M labor-adjustments and disputes . And ? it was of lesser consequence , but oh , it did matter ? we had money enough to live on ! ! We had made ourselves honestly think that we had just about everything we wanted on what we got , plus lectures , in California . But once we tasted of the new-found freedom of truly enough ; once there was gone forever that stirring around to pick up a few extra dollars here and there to make both ends meet ; once we knew for the first time the satisfaction and added joy that come from some responsible person to help with the housework ? we felt we were soaring through life with our feet hardly touching the ground . Instead of my spending most of the day in the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **27;190;TOOLONG Mrs. Willard . And just see what that meant . Every morning at nine I left the house with Carl , and we walked together to the University . As I think now of those daily walks , armin-arm , rain or shine , I 'd not give up the memory of them for all creation . Carl would go over what he was totalk about that morning in Introductory Economics , ? how it would have raised the hair of the orthodox Economics I teacher , ? and of course we always talked more or less of what marvelous children we possessed . Carl would begin , ' Tell me some more about the June-Bug ! ' He went to his nine o'clock , I to mine . After my ten-o'clock class , and on the way to my eleven-o'clock lecture , I always ran in to his office a second , to gossip a moment over what mail he had that morning , and how things were going generally . Then , at twelve in his office again , ' Look at this telegram that just came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that job ? ' And then home together ? not once a week , but every day . Afternoons , except the three afternoons when I played hockey , I was at home ; but always there was a possibility that Carl would ring up about five : ' I am at a meeting down-town . Ca n't get things settled , so we continue this evening . Run down and have supper with me , and perhaps , who knows , a Bill Hart film might be around town ! ' I do wish my Carl could have experienced those joys financial a little longer . It was so good while it lasted ! And it was only just starting . Every new call he got to another university was at a salary from one to two thousand dollars more than what we were getting , even at Seattle . It looked as if our days of financial scrimping were forever by . We even discussed a Ford ! Nay , even a four-cylinder Buick ! And every other Sunday we had fricasseed chicken , and always , always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months in Seattle we felt as if we ought to have company at every meal . It did not seem right to sit down to food as good as that with just the family present . Every other Sunday night we had the whole Department and their wives to Sunday supper ? sixteen of them . Oh , clear ! oh , dear ! money does make a difference . We grew more determined than ever to see that more people in the world should get more of it . IV Seattle , as I look back on it , meant the unexpected ? in every way . We could never count on anything front one day to the next ? a strike here , an arbitration there , government orders for this , some investigation needed for that . It was harassing , it was wearying . But always every few clays there would be that telephone ring I grew both to dread and love . For as often as it said , I 've got to go to Tacoma , ' it also said , You Girl , put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I have a few minutes off ? we ' 11 have supper together , anyhow . ' And the feeling of the courting days never left us ? that almost sharp joy of being together again when we just locked arms for a block and said almost nothing ? nothing to repeat . And the good-bye that always meant a wrench , always , though it might mean being together within a few hours . And always the waving from the one on the back of the car to the one standing on the corner . Nothing , nothing , ever got tame . After ten years , if Carl ever found himself a little early to catch the train for Tacoma , say , though he had said goodbye but a half an hour before and was to be back that evening , he would find a telephone-booth and ring up to say ? perhaps ? that he was glad he had married me ! And I think of two times we met accidentally on the street in Seattle , ? it seemed something we could hardly believe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , stopped while we tried to realize what had happened . One evening I was scanning some ar- ticle on marriage , by the fire in Seattle ? it was one of those rare times when Carl too was at home and going over lectures for the next day . It held that , to be successful , marriage had to he an adjustment ? a giving in here by the man , there by the woman . And I said to Carl , If that is true you must hate been doing all the adjusting : I never have had to give up or fit in or relinquish one little thing , so you 've been doing it all . ' He thought for a moment , then answered , You know , I 've heard that too , and wondered about it . For I knot , I 've given up nothing , made no " adjustments . " On the contrary , I seem always to have been getting more than any human being has any right to count on . ' It was that way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identically the same things to eat , seasoned the identical way . We both liked to do the identical things , without a single ex. ception . Perhaps one exception ? he had a fondness in his heart for firearms that I could not share . Though we rarely could pass one of these shooting-galleries without trying our luck at five cents for so many turns ? at clay pigeons or rabbits whirling around on whatnots ; but that was as wild as I ever wanted to get with a gun . We liked the same friends without exception , the same books , the same pictures , the same music . He wrote once , ' We ( the two of us ) love each other , like to do things together ( absolutely anything ) , do n't need or want anybody else , and the world is ours . ' As soon as the I.W.W. article was done , Carl had to begin on his paper to be read before the Economic Association just after Christmas in Philadelphia . That was fun working over . Come up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd go over that much of the paper together . Then more reading to Miss Van Doren , more correctings , finally finishing it just the day before he had to leave . But that was partly because he had to leave earlier than expected . The government had telegraphed him to go on to Washington to mediate a threatened longshoremen 's strike . Carl worked harder over the longshoremen than in any other single labor difficulty , not excepting the eight-hour day in lumber . Here again I do not feel free to go into details . The matter was finally , at Carl 's suggestion , taken to Washington . On his way he stopped off in Spokane to talk with the lumbermen east of the mountains . There , at a big meeting , he was able to put over the eight-hour day . The Wilson Mediation Commission was in Seattle at the time . Felix Frankfurter telephoned out his congratulations to me and said , We consider it the single greatest achievement of its kind since the United States entered the war . ' The papers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson was telegraphed to by the Labor Commission , and he in turn telegraphed back his pleasure . In addition , the East Coast lumbermen agreed to Carl 's scheme of an employment manager for their industry , and detailed him to find a man for the job while he was in the East . Then at Philadelphia came the most telling event of our economic lives ? Carl 's paper before the Economic Association on ' Motives in Economic Life . ' A little later I saw one of the big men who was at that meeting , and he said , ' I do n't see why Parker is n't spoiled . He was the most talked-about man at the Convention . ' Six publishing houses wrote out after that paper , to see if he could enlarge it into a book . Somehow it did seem as if now more than ever the world was ours . We looked ahead into the future and wondered if it could seem as good to anyone as it seemed to us . It was almost too good  --  we were dazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things I just can not let myself ever think of ? that future and the plans we had . Anything I can ever do now would still leave life so utterly dull by comparison . One of the days in Seattle I think of the most was about a month before the end . The father of a great friend of ours died , and Carl and I went to the funeral one Sunday afternoon . We got in late , so stood in a corner by the door and held hands , and seemed to own each other especially hard that day . Afterwards we prowled around the streets , talking of funerals and old age . Most of the people there that afternoon were gray-haired ? the family had lived in Seattle for years and years and these were the friends of years and years back . Carl said , ' That is something we ca n't have when you and I die ? the old , old friends that have stood by us year in and year out . It is one of the phases of life you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But in the first place neither of us wants a funeral , and in the second place we feel that moving gives more than it takes away ? so we are satisfied . ' Then we talked about our own old age ? planned it in detail . Carl declared , ' I want you to promise me faithfully you will make me stop teaching when I am sixty . I have seen too much of the tragedy of men hanging on and on and students and education being sacrificed because the teacher has lost his fire ? has fallen behind in the parade . I feel now as if I 'd never grow old ? that does n't mean that I wo n't . So no matter how strong I may be going at sixty , make me stop ? promise . ' Then we discussed our plans ? by that time the children would be looking out for themselves , very much so , and we could plan as we pleased . It was to be England ? some suburb outside of London where we could get into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by ourselves , and read and write , and have the young economists traveling out to spend week-ends with us ; and then we could keep our grandchildren while their parents were traveling in Europe ! Five weeks from that day he was dead ! There is a path I must take daily to my work at college , which passes through the University of California Botanical Garden . Every day I must brace myself for it , for there , growing along the path , is a clump of old-fashioned morning glories . Always , from the time we first came back to teach in Berkeley and passed along that same path to the University , we planned to have morning glories like those , ? the odor came to meet you yards away , ? growing along the path to the little home we would at last settle down in when we were old . We used to remark always when we saw pictures in the newspapers of So-and-so on their ' golden anniversary , ' and would plan about our own golden-wedding day ' ? old age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a time when we used to plan to live in a lighthouse , way out on some point , when we got old . It made a strong appeal , it really did . We planned many ways of growing old ; not that we talked of it often , ? perhaps twice a year , ? but always , always it was , of course , together . Strange how neither of its ever dreamed that one would grow old without the other . And yet , too , there is the other side . I found a letter written our first summer back in Berkeley , just after we had said good-bye at the station when Carl left for Chicago . Among other things he wrote , ' It just makes me feel bad to see other folks living put-in lives when we two ( four ) have loved through Harvard and Europe , and it has only commenced , and no one is loving so hard or living so happily . . . . I am most willing to die now ( if you die with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy already . ' And then he added , ? if only the adding of it could have made it come true ! ? t we have fifty years yet of love . ' Oh , it was so true that we packed into ten years the happiness that could normally be considered to last a lifetime ? a long lifetime . Sometimes it seems almost as if we must have guessed it was to end so soon , and lived so as to crowd in all of joy we could while our time together was given us . I say so often that I stand right now the richest woman in the world ? why talk of sympathy ? I have our three precious marvelously healthy children ; I have perfect health myself ; I have all and more than I can handle of big , ambitious , maturing plans , with a chance to see them carried out ; I have enough to live on , and ? greatest of all ? almost fifteen years of perfect memories . And yet , ? to hear a snatch of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were together , ? perhaps it was the very music they played as you left the theatre arm-in-arm that last night ; to put on a dress you have not worn for some time and remember that when you had it on last it was the night you went , just the two of you , to Blanc 's for dinner ; to meet unexpectedly some friend , and think that the last time you saw him it was that night when you two , strolling with hands clasped , met him on Second Avenue accidentally and chatted on the corner ; to come across a necktie in a trunk , to read a book he had marked , to see his handwriting ? perhaps just the address on an old baggage-check ? Oh , one can sound so much braver than one feels ! And then , because you have tried so hard to live up to the pride and faith he had in you , to be told , ' You know I am surprised that you have n't taken Carl 's death harder . You seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the East in January , he was more rushed than ever ? his time more filled than ever with strike-mediations , street-car arbitrations , cost-of-living surveys for the government , conferences on lumber production . In all he had mediated twenty-six strikes , sat on two arbitration boards , made three cost-of-living surveys for the government . ( Mediations did gall him ? he grew intellectually impatient over this eternal patching-up of what he was wont to call ' a rotten system . ' Of course , he saw the war-emergency need of it just then , but what he wanted to work on was , why were mediations ever necessary ? What social and economic order would best insure absence of friction ? ) On the campus , work piled up . He had promised to give a course on Employment Management , especially to train men to go into the lumber industries with a new vision . Each big company east of the mountains was to send a representative . It was also open to seniors in college , and a splendid group it was , almost everyone pledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? no fear that they would take it up with a capitalist bias . Then , ? his friends and I had to laugh , it was so like him , ? the afternoon of the morning he arrived , he was in the thick of a scrap on the campus over a principle he held to tenaciously ? the abolition of the one-year modern-language requirement for students in his college . To use his own expression , he ' went to the bat on it , ' and at a faculty meeting that afternoon it car- ried . He had been working his little campaign for a couple of months , but in his absence in the East the other side had been busy . He returned just in time for the fray . Everyone knows what a farce one year of a modern language is at college ? even several of the language teachers themselves were frank enough to admit it . But it was an academic tradition ! I think the two words that upset Carl most were ' efficiency ' and tradition ' ? both being used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm than good . And the word ' blame ' ? or not so much the word as the act . Of all the useless occupations a person could indulge in , he felt ' blaming ' someone as utterly unproductive as anything one could conceive . Especially did he revolt at blaming persons or groups , ? such as the I.W.W. , for instance , ? where he felt so strongly that they were a product of a certain social and economic environment , and under the circumstances ? given the known antecedents ? could not act otherwise . By the same reasoning he refused to blame the capitalist as such . VI And then came one Tuesday , the fifth of March . He had his hands full all morning with the continued threatened upheavals of the longshoremen . About noon the telephone rang : threatened strike in all the flour-mills ? Dr. Parker must come at once . ( I am reminded of a description which was published of Carl as a mediator : ' He thought of himself as a physician and of an industry on strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patient 's pain with opiates . He used the knife and tried for permanent cures . ' ) I finally reached him by telephone ? his voice sounded tired for he had had a very hard morning . By one o'clock he was working on deleted material nurse came at once to the house ? the best nurse in the whole city , ' the doctor announced with relief . Wednesday ' afternoon the crisis seemed to have passed . That whole evening he was himself , and I ? I was almost delirious from sheer joy . To hear his dear voice again just talking naturally ! Ile noticed the trained nurse for the first time . He was jovial ? happy . ' I ant going to get some fun out of this now ! ' he smiled . And , oh , wo n't we have a time , my girl , while I am convalescing ! ' And we planned the rosiest weeks anyone ever planned . Thursday the nurse shaved him ? he not only joked and talked like his dear old self ? he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been cheerful ? always told the doctor he was feeling ? never complained about anything . It amused the doctor so one morning , when he was leaning over listening to Carl 's heart and lungs , while he lay in more or less of a doze and partial delirium . A twinkle suddenly came into Carl 's eye : ' You sprung a new necktie on me this morning , did n't you ? ' he said . Sure enough , it was new . ) Thursday morning the nurse was preparing things in another room for his bath , and I was with Carl . The sun was streaming in through the windows , and my heart was too contented for words . He said , Do you know what I 've been thinking of so much this morning ? I 've been thinking of what it must be to go through a terrible illness , and not have someone you loved desperately around . I say to myself all the while , " Just think , my girl was here all the time ? my girl will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning and wondered more than ever what good angel was hovering over me the day I met you . ' I put this in because it is practically the last thing he said before delirium Caine on again , and I love to think of it . He said really more than that In the morning he would start calling for me early . The nurse would try to soothe him for a while , then would get me . I wanted to be in his room at night , but they would not let me : there was also an unborn life to be thought of those days . As soon as I reached his bed , he would clasp my hand and hold it , oh , so tight . ' I 've been groping for you all night ? all night ? why do n't they let me find you ? ' Then , in a moment , he would not know I was there . Daytimes I had not left him five minutes , except for my meals . Several nights they had finally let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time since the crisis the doctor was encouraged ? " flings are really looking up , ' and ' You go out for a few moments in the sun ! ' I walked a few blocks , to the Mudgetts ' in our department , ? to tell them the good news , ? and back ; but my heart sank to its depths again as soon as I entered Carl 's room . The delirium always affected me that way ? to see the vacant stare in his eyes ? no look of recognition when I entered . The nurse went out that afternoon . He 's doing nicely , ' was the last thing she said . She had not been gone half an hour , ? it was just two-fifteen , ? I was lying on her bed watching Carl , when he called , ' Huddle , I 'm going ? come hold my hand . ' Oh , my God ? I dashed for him , I clung to him , I told him he could not , must not go ? we needed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . I felt so sure of it , I said , ' Why , my love is enough to keep you here ! ' He would not let me leave him to call the doctor . I just knelt there holding both his hands with all my might , talking , talking , telling him we were not going to let him go . And then at last the color came back into his face , he nodded his head a bit and said , ' I 'll stay , ' very quietly . Then I was able to rush for the stairs and tell Mrs. Willard to telephone for the doctor . Three doctors we had that afternoon . They reported the case ' Dangerous but not absolutely hopeless ' ? his heart , that had been so wonderful all along , had given out . That very morning the doctor had said , ' I wish my pulse was as strong as that ! ' and there he lay ? no pulse at all . They did everything ? our own doctor stayed till about ten , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a block away . About one-thirty the nurse had me call the doctor again . I could see things were going wrong . Once Carl started to talk rather loud . I tried to quiet him and he said , ' Twice I 've pulled and fought and struggled to live just for you one of the times had been during the crisis ? let me just talk if I want to . I ca n't make the fight a third time ? I m so tired . ' Before the doctor could get there , he was dead . With our beliefs what they were , there was only one thing to be done . We had never discussed it in detail , but I felt absolutely sure I was doing as he would have me do . His body was cremated , without any service whatsoever ? just one of his brothers and a great friend present . The next day the two men scattered his ashes out on the waters of Puget Sound . I feel it was as he would have had it . Out of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you had in his splendid work ? you know everything that I could say . I grieve for you deeply ? and I rejoice for any woman who , for even a few short years , is given the great gift in such a form . '
