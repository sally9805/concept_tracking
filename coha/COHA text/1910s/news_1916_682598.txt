txt Charges against Frederic C. Howe . Commissioner of Immigration at New York , were made in a speech in the House today by Representative William S. Bennet of New York , Republican , who alleged that conditions of immorality had existed and still existed at the Ellis Island immigration station as a result of Mr. Howe 's administration . " A half-baked radical , with free love ideas , " was one of the terms used by Mr. Bennet in assailing Mr. Howe . The New York member asserted that Commissioner Howe did not properly segregate the male and female aliens held at Ellis Island , that he had recommended the admission of immoral women under bond , that in one instance he caused the admission of an undesirable woman named Juliette , who was placed as a servant in the home of a friend of the Commissioner , and that the Howe administration , if changes were not made , would become more of a scourge to New York than infantile paralysis . Mr. Bennet gave the matron at Ellis Island credit for correcting some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist a year or more ago , but said that other evils had taken their place . Mr. Bennet tollowed his speech by introducing a resolution calling upon the Department of Labor for information relating to various phases of Mr. Howe 's administration , including his plan to abolish competitive bidding in letting contracts for feeding immigrants detained at the island and substituting a scheme of Government ownership of the restaurant privilege . His resolution demands a copy of an opinion of the Department of Justice on this point . Mr. Bennet said that he had been unable to obtain a copy of the opinion . Reviews Howe 's Career . ' In leading up to his attack today , Mr. Bennet mentioned his own part in passing the Mann White Slave law . Then he reviewed the career of Commissioner Howe , saying that he Caine to New York several years ago from Cleveland and was a decided " extremist . " " He became Superintendent of what is known as the People 's Institute . " said Mr. Bennet , " an organization whose function was to incite discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good choice for that place . Somehow or other he was cnosen as Commissioner of Immigration at Ellis Island in 1014. " - Launching into his allegations , Rep. resontative Bennet said : " I have known Ellis Island for years . I was six years on the Immigration Committee . I secured appropriations of over $2,000,000 for necessary buildings for the care and comfort of the immigrants , and I. as a. member of the Immigration Commission , in connection with my friend , Judge Goldfogle , conducted an independent investigation of Ellis Island which resulted in rectifying some evils that did exist there . Now , what did I find ? " I found ' first from my inquiry that the . Commissioner of Immigration is the most negligent Commissioner that we have ever had , the most frequently absent , and that he pays the least attention to his duty of any Commissioner in my time . " One section of the . immigration law provides that an alien prostitute may be *arrested ' anywhere in the United States at any time ' after entry into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was commendable activity on the part of the department in that respect . These women were brought to Ellis Island . " Some years ago we enlarged Ellis Island so that persons of that character might be segregated from the decent women who are detained there largely for pecuniary reasons , waiting for money to be sent by their people . I found to my horror that this Commissioner of Immigration had abrogated those salutary rules . " Mr. Bennet then charged that immoral persons had been permitted to mingle at will with other immigrants , and then said : " The department sent over there as matron of the detention room a Mrs. Harris , a very estimable lady , a fine woman . I do not have the honor of personal acquaintance with her , but everything I hear about her is of the best . She had the old-fashioned idea that you can not handle pitch without being defiled , and by reason of some of her recommendations conditions there have been to some extent mitigated , and some of the scandalous occurrences have ceased to exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Commissioner Howe as " more radical in his views to governmental affairs than any member of this House , and that gives somewhat of an idea of him as an extremist . " Continuing , he said : " But tocay. at this very hour , another condition exists , which , if persisted in. will be far more harmful , and perhaps has been far more harmful to the City of New York than the scourge of infantile paralysis that is per lading the city . This Commissioner has opened a recreation ground . In the old days the sexes were kept separate . This Commissioner turns them all , men , women , and children , out into a common recreation ground . " Furthermore , in the past two years he has recommended to the department here that these individual prostitutes be admitted on bond , which simply means a license to proceed wherever they will . " The gentleman is certainly indicting a man for the worst moral crime I ever heard of , " said Representative Cox of Indiana ; " It the charges are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have confidence in the gentleman ? Is there not some way in which you can impeach him ? " " I am going to suggest it . " said Representative Bennet . " I have in my hand a resolution to investigate Ellis Island . " As I was saying , the Commissioner has recommended the admission of prostitutes on bond . " In one case , " Mr. Bennet continued . " he recommended the admission of one of these prostitutes , a woman garnet Juliette , and had her transferred to a family of friends as a servant . " I do not believe that he is morally wrong , " Mr. Bennet went on . " I simply think that his governmental ideas are wrong . " Mr. Bennet cited an alleged instance of immorality on Ellis Island and then said that while conditions in the House made it practically impossible to obtain action now on his resolution , he felt a good purpose might be served if the resolution was informally submitted to the Department of Labor . " Mr. Speaker , " he continued , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at large whether in offering a particular resolution I discharge my duty to the best of my capacity . I believe I did , I know it , but it le of tremendous importance whether a half-baked radical , who has free love ideas , no proper idea of the effect of the mingling of the good with the bad , should be upheld , ana while the subject is distasteful in the extreme , I have taken the first opportunity after the facts were brought to my notice to bring .. to the House of Representatives the conditions as they exist at Ellis Island in the sincere hope and belief that once they are made p'iblic the department will see that they are rectified . " The resolution which Mr. Bennet offered calls for the production of all papers relating to the food contract on Ellis Island and memoranda relating to the regulations affecting the segregation of the sexes on the island . Frederic C. Howe , the Commissioner on Immigration , left Ellis Island last Saturday afternoon , and said that lie would be away- for a week at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
