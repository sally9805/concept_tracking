December .23 , 1916 THE NEW gone , at least until Russia becomes a modern state . Britain is no longer the interventionist who emerges from isolation to set things in balance . She is now an integral part of the continental system , a part of the balance of power , instead of its guardian . The role which was Britain 's is passing to America , and President Wilson 's offer to join a league of peace is really a recognition of the fact that the United States can guarantee the equilibrium and thus maintain at least a temporary security in the world . The question which Germany has put to the Allies , but especially to Britain , is this : Do you recognize this new situation as unalterable and will you accept the loss of prestige which results from it ? The answer must turn on a very difficult judgment of the military situation . If the Allies are humanly sure that at a bearable cost they can win a victory which will destroy the predominance of Middle Europe on the Continent and retrieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be orthodox . But if they are once again underestimating the strength of the central alliance , if through vanity or stubbornness they are unable to face the facts , then a refusal to negotiate is an abominable waste of life , and the statesman who refuses peace now will have to answer for it next summer , perhaps a year from next summer . Woe to him if he orphans and widows and starves a million homes and is then forced to negotiate the same peace which is offered to him now . Even though the Allies find reasons for continuing the war , they can not help recognizing that their ability to prosecute it is seriously weakened . It will be impossible to sustain the picture of a Germany that will listen to no argument but the sword . Belgian deportations , zeppelin raids , and submarine " errors " will help Mr. Lloyd George , but nevertheless as the agony goes on , and a moderate German offer of peace exists , the psychological case of the Allies will deteriorate . British morale especially has depended on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty and peace . The sense that the cause was just has mattered most in the British Empire , because it was not unified by invasion or rendered automatic by conscription . The British volunteered for a crusade , accepted compulsory service because they were told it would save them from a fearful menace . But even two and a half years of war will not have blotted out the island individualism . Once Germany offers peace on moderate terms , and steals the clothes of the liberals , Mr. Lloyd George will have to perform the staggering task of explaining to the British people the politics of prestige . For Lack of Help I T is a matter of pride to America that the re-lief of Belgium was organized by a commission under Herbert C. Hoover , and carried out with American aid . There are circumstances connected with this work , however , which take away from any extravagant national satisfaction . They should really be the occasion of national shame . None of these circumstances relates to the administration of the Commission for Relief in Belgium . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let alone American . At a time when the world was deaf with gunfire , an American proceeded without one waste motion to make war all by himself on the immediate bodily consequences of the invasion of Belgium , and soon to extend the name of America to a vast work of goodwill . For the first time in the history of war there was an outsider to take a comprehensive view of civilian pain and misery and suffering , to treat a prostrate country as the victim of a disaster similar in result to a plague or a blight , to obtain the permission of belligerents for the organizing of subsistence and succor . On this side of the project there can be nothing to diminish esteem . Everyone knows how the Commission for Relief in Belgium undertook a task as humane as it was difficult , as difficult as it was indispensable . There were over 9,000,000 civilians blockaded in a territory that had never provided more than a fraction of its food or its fodder in time of peace , and had early lost most of its harvest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From 2,500,000 to 3,500,000 of these blockaded civilians were not only at a loss for supplies but partly destitute even when supplies were forthcoming , and unable to go to work for factories debarred from export trade and from the importation of raw material . This was the situation into which the commission came , with Mr. Hoover in charge , and one belligerent in command of the sea-avenues and another in command of the population . It is common knowledge how Mr. Hoover intervened , and how England and Germany rationalized their enmity to give the commission its chance . Thirty-seven thousand volunteer workers came under the commission . Every Belgian civilian got his card for supplies , and wheat and bacon and rice and beans were purchased in primary markets for all Belgium and transported with special assistance from every side under protection of a special flag , and consigned without divergence through the canals of Belgium to communal committees , and distributed to the ultimate consumer without a grain 's leakage or loss . The administration of these measures by the commission added an expenditure of no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Americans was well under a hundred in this work on the spot , their presence was an absolute requirement . Their neutrality assured England that the food went to the civil population , for whom it was intended , and the necessity for continuing this assurance to England kept the commission in service even after the work was felt to be ready for the Belgians themselves . It is not as to the administration of the C. R. B. , but as to its resources , that America 's questionable position comes in . The facts as to receipts and disbursements are quite simple . On November 1st , the commission announced that $173,658,913 had already been expended for the food and clothing distributed in Belgium and Northern France . Of this total over a hundred million dollars had been spent on the purchase of supplies in the United States . So much for disbursement . The funds thus laid out by the commission came from three sources : subsidies from the Allied governments of France and Britain , operations of a money exchange department , and public charity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly loans to be liquidated after the war . The revenue from the exchange department has been small . Public charity has amounted to $23,503,771 , of which the United States gave thirty-seven per cent and the British Empire nearly all the rest . As the funds are here indicated , they appear to be meeting the outlay , but there are factors now emerging which make the situation ominous for the whole work of relief . These factors are defined by the C. R. B. itself , from its New York office , 120 Broadway . The subventions from the Allied governments , on the one hand , are exceedingly unlikely to be increased . The cost of food , on the other , has been enormously increased , and the effects of a minimal ration on a people insufficiently sheltered and clad is already filling the C. R. B. with alarm . The consumption of wheat per person per day was cut from a normal portion of 670 grammes to under 300 grammes , as a result of the war . The consumption of supplementary food was also greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fodder , a consequent sacrifice of live stock and a depletion of the milk supply . The effect of these unremitting deprivations may appear trivial to the outsider , even when he knows that 6o per cent of the population is absolutely dependent on the commission for food , and is unable to buy meat , butter or coffee , at the private prices of from $1.00 to $1.50 a pound . But the physiologist has been made horribly aware of the consequences of this slow starvation . He has seen malnutrition at work on the 2,575,000 growing children under17 , not less than 1,000,000 of whom are dependents , and he has already recorded a sharp increase of tuberculosis . To arrest this disease he now prescribes a special noonday lunch each day in the schools and other controlled establishments . The cost of this meal is estimated at $1 per child per month , or $1,000,000 a month extra . This expenditure is regarded as necessary to safeguard the growing children by all the child specialists to whom the C. R. B. has gone for advice . And this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States . The need is startling . Men just back from Belgium say that of course there is no sensational famine , but children are emaciated , they faint from hunger in school , they drift to death . If citizens of the United States had never professed horror at the treatment of Belgium , it would be idle to examine their attitude on Belgian relief . Their attitude , however , needs to be examined . No one has yet had time to forget the enormous indignation that was generated in this country when Germany violated Belgium . It was , in most instances , a normal response to the crime , an impulse on the part of ordinary decent human beings to throw their weight into the scales against injustice , to enlist in the forces of the world organized to punish such acts and discourage their renewal . But while indignation , the punitive impulse , moved many Americans and still moves them , there were a hundred persons who denounced the wickedness of Germany to one who sought in the least measure to remit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Boston and Philadelphia and Chicago and New York , to name only the major groups , there was a protestation at the outrage of Belgium that sounded like a depthless pity turned to anger . The hatred of cruelty seemed to tear the hearts of these Americans . Misery and suffering were the portion of Belgium , and men cried for war because of it . A war , it is true , would have cost much money . The military budget of x915 came to $240,000,000 without any war . But Belgium was so grave a betrayal of international confidence that the anger at German aggressiveness reached , in well-to-do circles , the fighting pitch . But not the disbursing pitch . These well-to-do Americans wanted to shed their blood to avenge Belgium . They were not equally willing to shed their dollars to keep life in the bodies of Belgian children . Theirs was a remarkably loud cry for remarkably little wool . Up to last July all Massachusetts scrabbled together about $235,000 for Belgium . In the same period South Australia sent Belgium $446,000 , or proportionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvanians managed to send $370,000 , in contrast with $2,936,000 from New South Wales . The inhabitants of New South Wales were proportionately 38 times as generous as the frantic sympathizers in Pennsylvania . Illinois poured out $143,000 in the course of twenty months of high emotion about Belgium . New Jersey sent $19,000 in 20 months . Most people feel that the first impulse aroused by needless suffering is the impulse to assuage it , that if the remedy for suffering is made clear , decent human beings can not fail to apply it , can not go on in negligent consciousness of damaging want . Back of all the platitude and hypocrisy and convention of public expression , there is this persistent belief in the fund of human goodwill , this belief that it will be applied if it is once excited ? a belief to which Christmas , for all the irony of war and the strategy of " peace , " is still the recurrent witness and testament . If this is the case , the stark need of Belgium should pierce every American consciousness this Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal to more than easy indignation . It is a real appeal for urgent help , for lack of which children must die .
