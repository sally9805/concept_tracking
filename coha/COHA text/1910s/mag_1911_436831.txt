MANY of us would doubtless confess , in despite of the canons of criticism , to a liking for certain stories which are not , properly speaking , stories at all , but lingering , anecdotal sketches of character , innocent of climax , uncertain as to " beginning and middle and end . " The charm of good portraiture , human and other , which we find in Rab and his Friends , in Cranford , in Miss Jewett 's delicately sketched New England types , appears in slighter degree in the work of many a minor writer , and our interest is in direct proportion to its fidelity . One wonders if , in those mythical days when literature is said to have come into being through the chanted exploits of heroes , primitive folk did not sometimes sit round their campfires telling hero tales when there wereno great deeds to tell , only characteristic little acts and minor happenings .. Surely some of the slighter touches in the great epics are as full of power to interpret a distinctive personality as are the more conspicuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , perhaps , than in earlier days , now when , in our own country at least , machinery dominates the minds of story-tellers and story-readers , when any fresh invention floods the magazines with tales centring in the new mechanism . The motor-car has already monopolized our fiction to such an extent that the word action ' has grown ambiguous , becoming almost synonymous with speed , and the aeroplane is threatening to make this change of meaning permanent . While the new type is so conspicuously present , as in The Sovereign Power , I in which the human interest is strictly subordinated to the management of monoplane and biplane , it is a comfort to find a volume of old-fashioned tales , such as Later Pratt Portraits , 2 devoted to the delineation of character . A sane and gentle philosophy of life lies back of these sketches , which are full of humorous appreciation of oddities , and full of sympathy . After all , we say , in laying down a book of this kind , the workings of human nature are really more important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretation of the life of young folk appears in Phoebe and Ernest , 3a series of crisp sketches showing keen insight into boy and girl nature , and the power to trace , in close and significant detail , successive stages of growth . When Caroline was Growing ' brings before us a charming , imaginative child , who appeals to us deeply in the earlier sketches , but in the later tales , which are a bit more perfunctory and artificial , grows less poetic and original . The type is one which has frequently been rendered , but we are glad of every new interpretation in these days when modern educational methods are threatening its very existence . We should welcome The End of a Song , ' ? the work of a college professor , ? if for no other reason , for the evidence it brings that academic life does not always dry and corrode human nature . These are tenderly conceived and delicately executed sketches of folk in a small Welsh village , and the blending of their lives with the lives of animals , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are new and picturesque touches in presenting the old , old facts of human life and human affection , and the book is full of humor ? humor that is often very near to tears . Something of old-time charm is revealed in The Corner of Harley Street , ' a series of letters purporting to be written by a London physician . In these letters to many people , Peter Harding sketches his own fine personality , his friends , his family , his London , so that , without any plot at all , a whole section of modern life is presented . The author , with his humanity , his simple affection , his humor , his lack of egotism , often reminds the reader of the beloved Dr. John Brown ; but the finer instinct and the higher faith of the earlier physician betray a lack here . Again and again one is compelled to stop short at the blank wall of material things to which modern thought and especially modern science has led us , and one longs for the keener eye and the clearer vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of the author illustrates the point as well as any phase of the story could do . Given Meredith 's humor , ' says Peter Harding , how Hardy , with his first-hand observation , his extraordinary detachment , and the beautiful lucidity of his English , would have loomed above the creator of Sir Willoughby . ' When one remembers Meredith 's constant insistence on the triumphing struggle of spirit through matter , and Hardy ' s crass doctrine that matter is the whole of life , might not one be justified in saying that the author of The Corner of Harley Street shows himself here , to use Meredith 's own phrase , bull-blind to the spiritual ' ? But enough of sketches ! After all , the instinct for plot is an unappeasable one ; and children keep us constantly aware of the depth and the fundamental nature of the demand that a story shall be a story . This , by the way , is the hardest thing to make it , and the student of fiction is constantly surprised to find how few are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really great novels , so often does the causal chain of inevitable consequence break and fail in the dramatic type ; so often does some favorite personage , growing almost too much alive , run away with the plot . Fiction , and especially English fiction , is , as we all know , far more distinguished by the creation of great characters than by the working out of great plots ; and Thackeray 's confession that the trend of his story often depended on the mood of the morning , he , if in good humor , being inclined to make his characters do admirable deeds , and if in a bad humor , being tempted to thrust them into villainy , may well be considered the unspoken confession of many another great novelist . If we were to try to state what a plot should be , learning this wisdom not from critical treatises , but from treasured memories of novels , and from the reproving mouths of children when one fails to tell a story aright , we should say that the laws of plot are as simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep on telling the same story , in more or less the same fashion , about the same people ; he should tell it all , and no more . If he must go back , lit the past help and not hinder the present ; if he must have more than one strand to his tale , let them be necessary to each other . Any one who , in a bedtime hour , has confused any part of the tale of Red Riding Hood with that of the Three Bears , has failed to tell either in full , or changed the outcome , or has attributed to Jack 's giant any of the characteristics of Bluebeard , must have learned from the small auditor precepts as deep as Aristotle ever taught about the requisites of plot , the reversal of fortune , the necessary consistency of character . With something of the single-mindedness of children we older listeners delight in the writer of fiction who can plot well ; who can separate , in the miscellaneous stuff of life , that which is essential to his purpose from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the human spectacle , his thought of it . We ask of him , not only that his work shall be true in detail , but that he shall see the meaning of the facts that he depicts , and shall marshal them toward the outcome so that we shall know his interpretation . It is a hard task , almost the hardest that any artist has to face , to keep on telling the same story , in the same fashion , about the same people ; to focus the interest on the chief personages , bringing out subtle interrelations ; to choose only those phases of character that are essential to the tale , and to trace the flowing of character into action . When novelist or dramatist can present , in individual lives , the clash of great forces , following the line of cause and effect through the moment of greatest strain , the supreme crisis , on to the catastrophe , and can make us feel that he is giving us a profound interpretation of human experience , we know that we are in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that the fiction of the last six months gives us no example of the supremely great . In these days when creative power is much less in evidence than is the power to analyze , when more and more in fiction the study of character and the treatment of event are differentiated , the former tending toward the expository sketch , the latter toward haphazard adventure and external action , it is a pleasure to find a plot so deftly wrought as that of The Patrician , ' with the dramatic motif kept clearly before you , unfolding story that is also character development , the inner issue and the outer being one and the same . In the tangle of motive , of emotion that clashes with class instinct , as Barbara , the daughter of a noble house , finds her interest too deep in a socialist reformer not of her class , as Miltoun , the noble son of the house , is overcome by passion for a woman not free to marry him , the informing idea is never blurred , though it is never expounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deft selection and subtle emphasis the author works out his theme , letting the reader watch the mental and moral bewilderment of the characters , but not making him share it , as is the way with many a lesser artist . The plot moves on inevitably toward crisis and catastrophe , as the moulding forces of tradition work out through character , and character flowers into action . It is seldom that one finds to-day a novel that delights us , as does this , by its shapeliness , finish , form . A classic severity and restraint are combined with a poignancy of suggestion and depth of appeal known only to romantic work , and often the veriest trifle reveals the depths of silent passion at work under the calm surface of conventional life . The grouping of the characters and the study of their growth shows an artist 's skill . To take the two types , the patrician and the plebeian , not at their worst but at their best , as the author has done in Miltoun and Courtier , was in itself a fine thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his faiths , and his terrible concentrated passion , is hardly more real than the plebeian , whose fine act of choice in its loyalty and delicacy almost surpasses the patricians ' . Just enough of Mr. Gals-worthy 's former tendency toward allegory remains to give the suggestion of type in each of these strongly individualized characters . In the clash between tradition and individual desire , you feel that they are patrician in least things and in great , in their demands and in their renunciations , for the old marching orders of caste are everywhere heard . Their consistencies and their inconsistencies bring them before us in the very complexity of life ; their fate seems to lie in their own hands and destinies , for you nowhere feel the author manipulating them . Not a little of Thackeray 's old Lady Kew and of Ethel go to the making of Granny and of Barbara , yet the character studies are both vivid and original . The haunting charm of Barbara follows one long after reading the book : Barbara with her modern wisdom , her wit , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tremendousness of the forces that make her suffer is all the deeper in effect because of her humor , and her illuminating , ironic sense of the whole situation . You can not get rid of the feeling that she is sharing it all with you , in subtle sympathy , and one finds her , in her spiritual detachment , a fascinating companion . Hereditary courage shows in her revolt , as the hereditary sense of values ends it ; and in all the book she is the most delicate gauge of the spirit and of the limitations of the patricians . In its deft nicety of management , its fitness of word to place and person , its significant and dramatic trifles of speech and of action , The Patrician might well serve as a measure or standard in the art of making fiction ; and it has ? something rare in our contemporary work ? distinctive style . There are deeper depths in life than it betrays , greater hurts and greater consolations ; but within the limits that the author sets for himself he handles his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irony ; he is an amused spectator of the game of the gods , ? hurt too , but perhaps not hurt enough to be stung into that action of the spirit that means searching out the interpretation . It is a pity that , with such power to make you feel the inevitability of the tragedy , of character that is destiny , he has so little of the Shakespearean power of making you feel that the tragedy is not in vain . There is no gleam of light at the end of the struggle . With memories of the leisurely pleasure derived from Nathan Burke , one welcomes Mrs. Watts again to the world of fiction . The Legacy , ' like The Patrician , deals with hereditary forces , presenting the development and the inner crises in the life of one Letty Breen , child of an American family of long tradition , now beginning to fall into poverty . It is also a study of social growth and change in a city on that border line where the poorer class begins to encroach on the old preserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satire is worked out through the study of the ramifications of the family pride , and in the emergence of the washerwoman 's son into the multimillionaire who ends by marrying the daughter of the proud but decaying house . Mrs. Watts makes you feel social complexities and interrelations ; and her sketching of the family as a whole , with all the varieties and the contradictions in the dominant traits , as that which is strength in one proves to be weakness in another , shows many a subtle stroke . The book , with all its quiet humor , is serious and gives pause for thought . Mrs. Watts seems to be saying : This somewhat enigmatic woman , with the heritage , from the great-grandmother whom she resembles , of much that is wild and bad , in the crisis of her life makes , after all , the choice that her own mother would have made , the self-sacrificing , high-minded mother . That quiet influence , hardly realized by the girl during her mother 's life , is really the dominant thing in her life ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more noteworthy because she is nowhere helped by strong emotion , for deep feeling never comes to her . One wonders why certain reviewers compare this novel unfavorably with Nathan Burke . It is not on so large a scale , being less epic , but in many ways it presents finer workmanship . The strength of the book lies in its character-study ; of action and event there is perhaps little . The depth and reality of the treatment of the girl 's development delight the reader , who lives from page to page with the child in the antique house set amid the encroaching slums ; the surroundings are as tangible as the experiences are vivid . Jim Hatfield , the washerwoman 's son , is admirably pictured , and the fine and silent way in which he is sketched in later years is both amusing and impressive : his going back , from the glory of multimillionairedom , to marry , for pity , the little lame playmate of his childhood being the surest key that we have to the real character of this unscrupulous financier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servant , the futile Mr. Edward Breen , who embodies the fine uselessness of the family , are as distinct as living personalities . Less convincing , and a bit too obviously reminiscent of Thackeray , is the worldly old aunt of continental experiences , rouged , dyed , and given to French phrases ; but for the most part the character-study suggests close and original observation . The book confirms our suspicion that Mrs. Watts is a wise woman . There is in her work a depth and richness , a ' veined humanity , ' rare in American fiction , which is rather given either to over-French finish in the matter of form , or to wild defiance of all considerations of form and taste ; both varieties being a bit superficial , viewed as interpretations of human life . With this writer , both thought and feeling cut deep into the heart of real things . Queed , by Henry Sydnor Harrison , is an interesting and original study of the development of a youthful scholar into a human being . The quick , journalistic style gives vividness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to the background picture of the Southern city . This , unlike the Southern city most common in fiction , is astir with new life , not fading into decay ; and its problems of civic righteousness , of intellectual integrity , its newspaper fights in the struggle of right and wrong , the hero is called upon to share . The book is virile ; and throughout one is aware of the sting of growth , both in the central personage and in the city with which his fortunes are closely involved . The detailed and realistic study of the hero 's development , a modern prose epic of character , is set in a romantic comedy plot , involving the mystery of the hero 's parentage , and the heroine 's loss of fortune through her father 's traitor friend , who finally is discovered to be the hero 's father . From humblest beginnings , in a city slum , trained only by the Irish policeman who is his benefactor , Queed emerges , winning his way into the world of scholarship , only to realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a human being , he has yet to be born . In execution the book is most uneven , combining real observation with touches from worn types of fiction and drama . Much of the character-study of Queed is fresh , full of feeling and of original humor ; much is borrowed from the stock pedant of the comic stage , who goes back as far as Latin comedy and , it may be , further . The suggestion of caricature that comes from presenting the hero at first as absolutely unhuman is unfortunate ; it disobeys one of the wise and simple canons of fiction as held by childhood , that the hero , from his first appearance , must be in some way recognizable as the hero . Even if he comes in rags , a bit of the gold trappings of the fairy prince must shine through . Some of the processes whereby the pedant becomes human are finely and closely traced , the best part of all being connected with the little girl Fifi . The scenes in which she , by her appealing helplessness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective than the scenes which present the heroine 's influence over him . The later stages of growth are at times obscure , and toward the end Queed seems to leap , after the fashion of a Dickens character , into his new personality . The lack of process in this part of the novel is disappointing ; there are gaps in the portraiture , and the physical growth , like the moral , seems too sudden and too complete . In a way we should almost be justified in an outcry to the effect that the author is not telling the same story about the same person , were it not for the strong link found in the hero 's passion for truth , which , shown at first only in matters intellectual , persists , applying itself later to human affairs . The romantic tale of concealed relationship lends an interest that does not entirely blend with the main interest of the story , though at one point it greatly helps the study of Queed 's character , showing his loyalty and his truth in the treatment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book contains much of promise . It is full of vitality , and of clean and wholesome humor . There is in it no shade of weariness , no touch of decadence , but a contagious faith in life and in the good of human nature . In workmanship it lacks the finish and charm of The Patrician , but its ringing assertion of the worth of human experience will rouse militant courage where the other will give an added sense of the deepening sadness of fate . The New 'M achiavelli 1 deals with the life of an English statesman engaged in great political affairs , and it presents , to quote the author , the subtle , protesting , perplexing play of instinctive passion and desire against too abstract a dream of statesmanship . ' The story of the hero is carried from earliest boyhood through his years of education and his political activity , through his change from radical to conservative conviction , to the time when , at the age of forty-two , he ruins his career by deserting his wife and going to Italy with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In spite of its well-nigh five hundred pages , the book lacks body ; the political part hardly carries conviction , perhaps partly because there is not enough close detail ; there is about it something of the airy unreality of Mr. Wells 's earlier style . The development of the hero is blurred and uncertain in its progress and its outline ; it is as if the writer not only did not have in mind an interpretation of his material , but were not even searching for it . It may be legitimate , it may even be desirable at times , for the scientist to present facts with no clear idea of their significance ; not so the novelist ; and the pseudo-scientific method , which we find in many a novel , in the presentation of an array of closely observed , but meaningless facts , has grown well-nigh unendurable . Art can not do without informing ideas , and in it the non-assorted , miscellaneous stuff of life has no place . ' The relation of the great constructive spirit in politics to individual character and weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the action nor by comment does the author make his interpretation clear . The meaning evades you ; the facts are not marshaled so that you must understand . You share the bewilderment in the hero 's mind , and are as completely involved in it as he , without getting the artistic significance . For all that he says about himself the hero never grows clear , and , in watching him , you feel as you would if a portrait-painter should crowd his canvas with details of costume and of feature , but should . draw no person . The wild invention of Mr. Wells 's early tales made no demand for the presentation of character in action ; the careless epic manner of Tono-Bungay was reinforced by humorous comment , so that the reader got a fairly clear idea of the hero 's way of stumbling on with some sense of a goal . Here , with more exacting material , the lack of dramatic gift on the part of Mr. Wells becomes clear ; cause and effect are not made apparent . It is not that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a good one ; or with the outcome , which is quite humanly possible . It is the inconclusiveness that leaves one unsatisfied ; the story might have been written by Kipling 's Tomlinson , so uncertain is it in its treatment of the great problems involved . 564 THE MAKE One misses here Mr. Wells 's usual humor , but some compensation is to be found in pages here and there of sound wisdom , set forth in expository fashion , and betraying the active thinker . If The New Machiavelli disobeys the stern demand of childhood that the story-writer shall know what his story is about , there are several others that disregard the equally cogent law that he shall keep on telling the same story . Why should that interesting tale , A Sinner in Israel , ' closely centred in the inner struggle of a Jew who finds that he is not really a Jew , that he has no claim upon the title and the fortune of his supposed father , but is free to usurp all if he will , ? why should this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wrong act of choice and its consequences , sudddenly dash off at the end into a Prisoner-of-Zenda kind of tale , and direct the issue to the Istrian struggle of a Pretender for supremacy ? We who read want to stay in that London which the novelist has pictured so fully and so sympathetically , that London of intelligent and devout Jews , whose faith , whose reverent customs , rouse deep interest . Here the struggle of conscience has an individual significance , because of the special training that has moulded and colored the boy 's mind , and we want a genuinely dramatic outcome , not an adventurous escape , from the situation . The picture of contemporary Jewish life has so much depth of appeal ; the sketches of the learned Jewish father and of his wayward son are so good ; the satire on the unscrupulous art-dealer is so like a Whistler portrait in its effectiveness , the description of Jewish ceremonial so full of charm , why change both scene and theme at almost the end of the story ? Another instance of changing motif @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a South African story , with an encompassing action of the Boer War . Here it is difficult to see how the theme of the latter part of the novel fits the earlier part . The unspeakable injury to the orphan child results in a dedication of herself to a great purpose ; but her later story , that of the wife who slowly , and long after marriage , learns to love her husband , is in no way vitally connected with the early part . The development of the central personage with her tragic early experience is disappointing ; here is a great opportunity , but who , after all , would be wise enough to use it ? Among the other characters the saintly and heroic Catholic sister proves the most appealing , and the maternal passion which she bestows upon the child of her dead lover is full of beauty . To the credit of human nature be it said that her flawless goodness seems more possible than does the flawless wickedness of the accomplished villain in the tale , who is too perfectly furnished with many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The book is not without strained and melodramatic diction , fitting the touches of melodrama in the story ; yet much of it is novel and interesting , and the desolate South African background is presented with intensity and significance . Again , in taking up The Price , ' we shall be disappointed in regard to the continuity of story . A young theorist robs the rich for the sake of the poor , and the improbable tale of the way in which the theft is accomplished is plausible enough . But when the reader is asking how the Robin Hood motif is to be carried out , the hero falls ill , and the love-story that follows proves disappointing in ignoring the problem with which the book begins . One lays it down with a wistful feeling of wanting to know how the real story would have come out . Esther Damon ' affords another instance of lack of continuity in the presentation of material . The underlying idea is an admirable one : the man and woman , who are village sinners and outcasts , are brought together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the story shifts from one to the other ; the hero 's socialistic schemes are hardly a vital part of the plot , and the whole suggests a lack of solidarity , of fusion of the different parts . Close observation and deep feeling are shown in the character-study of the heroine , her Methodist father and mother , Robert Orme , and the elderly Universalist , Mrs. Brewster , who brings her New England heterodoxy to dismay the little New York village . Work so sincere in its endeavor to penetrate the springs of human action is full of promise . Jane Oglander , 2 unlike the tales that waver in the telling , is an instance of a direct , centred plot , which , in both the major and the minor strands , clings to the same theme . The heroine , a woman of fine inner charm , is betrothed to General Lingard , whom she deeply loves ; he falls victim to a foolish , beautiful woman of the vampire type , Athena Maule , whose disillusioned husband , cynic and philanthropist , administers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Athena has ruined other men , and the story of one of them , Bayworth Kaye , a young soldier , runs side by side with the main plot . The book is not extraordinary , but it has interesting character-contrasts : the silent , loyal Jane ; the foolish , selfish Athena ; and Mrs. Kaye , whose dry and wordless affection for her son makes one of the most appealing phases of the book . The plot is as daring as it is logical , a rather startling instance of consistency in character , and of character manifest in action tha t seems plausible , for the outcome is artistically , if not ethically , justified . The author of The Broad Highways has very cleverly united two kinds of story , both of which have strong popular appeal : the spiritual type of swashbuckler adventure , with the idyllic tale of the open road . The novel has the charm of the story of the disinherited knight and of Little Boy Blue besides . There is plenty of good fighting in this account of Peter Vibart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will marry within a year Lady Sophia Sefton ; lovely ladies in distress are not lacking , nor is the villain , here the hero 's cousin , who at the end meets death at the hand of one of his victims . There is plenty of hard work and good blacksmithing in the rustic tale of the hut , where Lady Sophia is entertained unawares . The novel is . very much a unit , in spite of its varied elements , and in spite of the many literary influences that it suggests . One detects here a trace of the Vicar of Wakefield , there the influence of Maurice Hewlett ; Beatrix Esmond and Mrs. Burnett 's Lady of Quality are more than once brought to mind by the heroine , and there is much of Dickens in the delineation of the common folk ; yet what the author has borrowed he has made his own , and the romance is spirited , consistent , and sustained . Much of the rustic part of the tale is genuinely poetic , not in the pseudo-pastoral way , for the dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are real hedgerows . The stars and the wind and the open road , the inn with its ham and eggs , await here the lover of the simple life ; and many a page gives you a feeling as of grass fresh and cool under your feet . Nature herself is protagonist in Dr. Mitchell 's new novel , ' and the quietly told story of the way in which John Sherwood , Ironmaster , won not only health of body but health of soul from the Maine woods and the sea is especially refreshing in this iron age . Something of a materialist , like many another successful manufacturer , the hero is won back to his better and his earlier self by the ministry of wind and wave ; and the later story of his gentle deeds recalls in vital fashion the sensitive child of the initial chapters . There is , throughout the woodland life , a fresh and exquisite sense of Nature 's beauty , and of her healing power . Many kinds of story appear in The Prodigal Judge , ' a novel large , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tales which try to achieve French finish , and are more artificially than vitally unified , it is a pleasure now and then to find a rambling , humorous story , containing less of art than of human nature . We have here interest of haphazard event , romance , a story of a lost legacy , of a child abandoned , neglected , finding its own at last through the agency of the Judge . This character , the central personage of the book , is humorously and sympathetically rendered , something of a rascal , something of a gentleman , like Tartarin a bit meridional , but genuinely American in speech and in act . Several recent novels recall another demand on the part of the small auditor of a story , perhaps the most important demand of all , that it shall be real . The plot does not need to be probable , it needs only to seem so , and , as we all know , some of the most impossible tales , told by the great story-tellers , have been the most plausible . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impossible to say , but he who would practice upon us the delightful deceit of fiction must have it in large degree . There is in the fairy tale of the princess who changed every night into a frog a simple and convincing quality lacking in Mr. Hichens 's Dweller on the Threshold , 3 in which one clergyman changes into another . One would rather read the reports of the psychical society in their original form , as the bare narrative of supposed fact might well bring more of faith in the improbable than does this profoundly unimaginative bit of creative work . This tale of transformation has the same lack of illusion that gives to Mr. Hichens 's novels dealing with the sense side of life their heavy quality . Here you do not for a moment lose your questioning attitude , in momentary belief that it was so . Instead of sharing in fearful awe the experience of one person who is changing into another , you are aware only of puppets pulled as by wires . As for the narrative within the tale , which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would be a dull person who could so mistake it , as a swift rereading of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde will prove . This kind of tale demands imaginative power of a high order , and such imaginative power Mr. Hichens does not possess . If the preposterous story must seem plausible , what can be said of The Lever , ' which presents a world-controlling trust of gigantic benevolence ? Grown folk are perhaps as exigent as children in their demand for truth to type : when the latter learn to accept with faith a kindly stepmother or a well-intentioned witch , perhaps the former can believe in a disinterested trust . In this novel the failure to convince is not due wholly to the integral improbability of the theme , but largely to the lack of realistic detail . A child would want minute particulars as to how a well-intentioned witch would act ; the grown reader would wish to know exactly how a benevolent trust would act ; but the inner workings of this organization are of the vaguest . Mr. Gorham , its creator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of speaking adds to the effect of unreality in the character . Small folk are undoubtedly helpful in determining standards of story and of character presentation , but there is one aspect of fiction in which their judgments fail the older reader . They like to have the moral broadly and didactically stated , while mature people , or at least the more thoughtful among them , prefer to see some phase of the human spectacle set before them dramatically , that they may ponder it and seek out its meaning at their leisure . Careless of this fact , in The Glory of Clementina , ' Mr. Locke , like the author of that amusing and edifying book , Keeping up with Lizzie , 2 has resolutely shaped his material to the teaching of a lesson which , to the author , seems a wise one . That the kindly Jester should even momentarily forsake the small company of the artists , to join the over-full ranks of the teachers , is in itself a disappointment ; and the message that he reiterates throughout , that no woman should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light of the fact that history reports among womankind only one . Over-didactic , the book is still entertaining , but one misses in the carefully manipulated Clementina the golden charm of The Beloved Vagabond , which , by the way , in its unmorality and its seeming irresponsibility , contained a far finer and deeper teaching than this . There was a largeness about it ; it was full of the sweetness that may come from broken lives , and a great love of human kind shone through its gentle suggestiveness . In the new book , the *minor theme seems more important than the major , and the stupidity of wickedness which Quixtus discovers in his ineffectual attempts to achieve badness is made delightfully real . One hopes that Mr. Locke 's wise lightness of touch and his humor will not desert him , and that he will not turn his mind too much toward the need of putting an erring world or an erring sex on the right path . After all , the charm of good novel-writing , for all that we can ferret out about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , in spite of the wise advice printed in handbooks and in magazine articles , giving instructions as to how a novel must be written , ? as explicit in telling what to do with the hero in any given dilemma , as , according to Ruskin , the Academicians were in telling the artist where to place his brown cow , ? the problems of plot-making are as puzzling and almost as interesting as the problems of life itself . Deeper than questions of structure , deeper than questions of probability in the characters , of plausibility in detail , lies some unspoken demand that has to do with sub-conscious humanity , with immemorial habits and feelings of the human race . The love of children for old types and n , ew adventure may help the novelist to meet the demand for that which is the same , yet is ever combined with something fresh and different . Nowhere , perhaps , so well as from the months of youngsters can one get a right idea of the proper proportions in which to mix the well-known with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play demand both , and the charm of the oft-told tale , the charm of the new , must be in every good plot : the familiar blending with the unfamiliar , the typical personage and experience revealed in the individual . In all that they have to say about mingling the long-accustomed with the unknown , the little folk are formulating for themselves , and for posterity , laws worked out from dateless experience , and destined for enduring life .
