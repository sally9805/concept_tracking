 | WHY is it necessary to our commerce to have a merchant marine under the American flag ? We are one of the greatest industrial and producing nations on earth . We must have foreign markets to absorb our surplus products . Without them we shall have stagnation and depression and idleness and want . To secure our share of the open markets , such as Central and South America and the Orient , we must compete with other leading industrial nations of the world , such as Great Britain , Germany , and France . If we have to depend on their ships to carry our goods in competition with them to South America and the Orient , they will naturally favor British or German or French merchants , as the case may be , both in rates and service , as against American merchants . We have no control over or power to regulate these foreign steamship lines , or to prevent them from discriminating against our interests . If we have American ships , their first interest is to build up and extend American business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to build up British business , and the German ships to build up German business . After the European war is ended competition for the open markets of the world will be more intense than ever . We must have every facility that our competitors have if we are to get an even chance . Having few American ships in the foreign trade , we are dependent to-day on the flag of Great Britain for the carriage of the greatest part of our commerce . She is at war . She must use her ships for her own necessities first , as a matter of course . She can not supply us with the ships we need for our own commerce , and the longer the war lasts the less she can do for us . The German flag , our other chief reliance , has disappeared from the seas . If Great Britain 's control of the sea should be destroyed or seriously impaired , it would react disastrously on our trade and general situation . As an economic question , are we justified in relying upon the ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially when the nation upon whose ships we depend is , or may be , engaged in great wars ? The risk is too great for any first-class Power to take . We have no right to hazard the fortunes and the welfare and the safety of our country on such a chance . Already we are too close to the awful European conflict , although we are at peace with every belligerent . Let us secure our safety , physical and economic , by doing what is necessary to be done , and what we are so able financially and otherwise to do . We are , moreover , paying to foreign steamship lines more than $300,000,000 per year , when , by having our own ships , we could pay them for this service , and build up a merchant marine which will profit our people in time of peace and serve our country in time of war . The terrible events of the past year and a half in Europe and the acute situations which have arisen in our foreign relations have brought forcibly to the front the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heretofore believed to be necessary for the National safety . Our " splendid isolation , " upon which we have relied so much in the past as our chief protection , has been neutralized in great measure by the developments of modern science . Wireless telegraphy and wireless telephony , aeroplanes , fast steamships , powerful battleships , long-range guns , high explosives , and submarines which can cross the Atlantic and Pacific have awakened us to a realization of the fact that the great ocean barriers have largely disappeared . The most indispensable factor in any sensible plan of National defense is a powerful navy , capable of striking with effect both offensively and defensively , supplied with essential naval auxiliaries in the form of an American merchant marine , and manned by American seamen who are ready and willing to fight for the Stars and Stripes against any enemy on the face of the earth . What is a naval auxiliary ? It is a fleet of merchant vessels so constructed that they may render essential service and assistance to our battle-ships and cruisers in time of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace . We can not with safety rely upon our ability to purchase or charter suitable naval auxiliaries when a crisis appears . The very essence of preparedness for the navy is to have these vessels of suitable types  | and construction where we can put our hands on them quickly . We have not to-day under the American flag sufficient vessels to give our navy , in case of war , the support and assistance which are indispensable to its efficiency . I am informed by the Navy Department that we could draw from our present merchant marine approximately 700.000 gross tonnage of vessels that could be converted into naval auxiliaries . This leaves us with a deficiency of about 500,000 gross tonnage to meet the needs of our navy as it stands to-day , and without allowing for growth . Our neglect to provide in the past the necessary naval auxiliaries gives us , however , one great advantage . By building them now we can develop a type that will be better than anything the world has yet produced . The merchant marines of our leading rivals are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We can build new ships of modern equipment , constructed with special reference to navy uses , commercial requirements , and economical operation , that will be superior to anything that naval and marine architecture have yet turned out . The Government should proceed immediately with the construction of these auxiliaries as a part of the programme of preparedness . The vessels should be designed by the best marine and naval architects in the country . I wish to emphasize the importance of building these ships in American ship-yards and in our navy-yards . It is just as important a part of naval preparedness to have adequate ship-yards for the purpose of constructing and repairing vessels as it is fo have the vessels themselves and the men to man them . We must pursue an intelligent system of building up our ship-yards and our navy-yards as a part of the vital problem of naval preparedness . I imagine that there can be no difference of opinion as to the desirability of increasing our foreign trade . I believe that we shall all agree that the prosperity of this country depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What could more clearly prove this than the experience through which the Nation has recently passed and is now passing ? When the European war broke out , the first result was a complete disorganization of exchange and international credits , a dislocation of all foreign commerce , and its almost complete stoppage for several months . The effect upon our internal situation was immediate and dangerous . In all of our leading ports there was great congestion of grain , cotton , and supplies of all kinds , with corresponding injury and depression throughout the country . This was followed by a period of gradual loosening up , of restoration of confidence and credits , until now the orders from foreign nations have so stimulated our foreign trade that our industries are running full time and there is a demand for all of ou'r surplus products , particularly the products of the farms . Our only difficulty is a lack of ship tonnage , which is preventing our exports from being greater than they are . If the volume of our foreign trade should continue to be even as great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual prosperity in this country ; but when peace is restored in Europe there will be a decreased demand for many of our products . It will be necessary to substitute markets which are now available and practically untouched by us if we are to preserve our prosperity unchecked . I refer to the markets of South America and the Orient . If we take these markets while we have the chance , we can establish unparalleled prosperity in this country . We have by reason of the Federal Reserve system so organized and consolidated our credit resources that we now have the financial strength to extend our commerce wherever it will go . Our one and indispensable need is ships ? merchant ships of American registry . The question now arises as to how these merchant marine naval auxiliaries can be operated with the greatest benefit to the country . It must be borne in mind that a really useful naval auxiliary should consist of fast passenger and cargo ships as well as ordinary cargo ships . The combined passenger and cargo ships would be suitable for operation on specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Argentina , Colombia , Ecuador , Peru , and Chile , and to the Orient , touching at Honolulu and the leading ports in Japan , China , and the Philippines . We should not , however , establish regular steamship lines where sufficient and satisfactory service has been established by American companies operating ships under American registry . The ordinary cargo ships could be used in any and all parts of the world , and in such manner as will be most beneficial to the commerce of the country . To bring about these results a shipping  | board should be created consisting of the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of Commerce as members ex officio , and three members to be selected by the President and confirmed by the Senate . Congress should appropriate and put into the hands of this board a fund of $50,000,000 . This would be sufficient to create a naval auxiliary of suitable merchant ships of from four hundred thousand to five hundred thousand gross tons . This board should have authority to establish as quickly as possible steamship lines to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Orient . It should have authority to organize a corporation or corporations and to subscribe to the capital stock thereof in whole or in part to carry out the objects in view . It should also have the power to lease or charter ships to responsible individuals , firms , or corporations under such conditions as the board may deem best . This would put in the hands of the board a mobile fleet of vessels which could be used in any part of the world and under conditions that would enable them to meet any emergency that might arise anywhere with respect to our commerce . The shipping board should have power to reform our navigation rules and regulations ; to study shipping problems and recommend to Congress the necessary legislation to enencourage and develop a great merchant marine under the American flag . The time has come when the Congress should consider the creation of some instrumentality for the regulation of merchant marine companies . As it stands to-day , no ocean transportation company is subject to the least regulation or control by the Government . Marine companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operation of their ships when and as they please , and regardless of the rights of shippers . They fix rates and change rates without notice , arbitrarily and in total disregard of the rights of shippers . They determine what cargo they will or will not carry , and discriminate in favor of one shipper against another . The shipping board should also have the power , acting in conjunction with the InterState Commerce Commission , to arrange for the issuance of through bills of lading between our railway lines and steamship lines operating under the American flag in the foreign trade , and to provide the means whereby special through rates can be made between our railways and steamship lines to enable them to meet competition of foreign carriers in the open markets of the world . I am sure that plans and regulations of this character , if properly worked out , would give our shippers and business men the opportunity of largely increasing their business in foreign markets by putting them in better position to meet competition . The Shipping Bill introduced in the last Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that bill was introduced in September , 1914 , just after the war had begun , when it was necessary to move swiftly for the protection of American business interests . Even that measure would have been of inestimable service to the country had it passed , because there was a superabundance of purchasable ship tonnage which could have been bought at that time and used with immense benefit to American commerce during the past year . American business has paid dearly for the defeat of that measure . I am sure that the increased and extortionate ocean freight rates paid by our defenseless producers and shippers in the past twelve months have exceeded several times the $40,000,000 which the Shipping Bill authorized the Government to expend on merchant vessels . But this is only a small part of the injury . Grave losses have been sustained by our business men because they could not ship at all . No classes of our people are more vitally concerned in adequate steamship lines to deliver our products to foreign markets than our farmers and laboring men . Our farmers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets . This is notably true of grain and cotton . We depend absolutely upon foreign markets for the disposition of our farm surplus . To show the magnitude and importance of our foreign trade in farm products , I need only call attention to the fact that for the fiscal year 1915 our total exports were $2,716,178,465 , of which the total crude and manufactured farm products represented $1,616,687,466 , or more than fifty-nine per cent of our total exports . If steamship facilities are inadequate , the farmer has added difficulty if he is not to a large extent actually prevented from getting his surplus products to foreign markets . Moreover , he is a great sufferer from exorbitant freight rates . Because of the lack of American ships and the scarcity of ocean tonnage generally ocean freight rates in the Atlantic have been extor- tionately high . The normal rate of 4 cents per bushel for grain from New York to Liverpool has been increased to 40 cents per bushel . I do not have to argue with any intelligent farmer that he gets less for his grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ship it from New York to Liverpool than when it costs only 4 cents per bushel for the same service . The cotton producer in the South has suffered to a greater degree . Ocean freight rates on cotton have gone as high as $15 per bale from Galveston to Europe , as against $2.50 per bale prior to the war . Our farmers , because they produce the bulk of our wealth as well as the bulk of our exports , ought to be protected ' against extortionate freight rates , and ought to have the assurance of sufficient steamship service and reasonable rates to secure fair treatment and enable them at all times to compete in the open markets with their rivals in the other great farm producing regions of the world . How is the laboring man affected ? Labor on the farm is interested for the reasons already given about the farmer , but the laboring man in our great industrial plants is likewise deeply concerned in this subject . We exported in the fiscal year 1915 manufactured products , other than farm- products , $843 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total export trade for that year . As our manufacturers are put in position to compete in the open markets of the world with their great industrial rivals of other nations , labor will be employed in this country more regularly and at higher wages . Wide fluctuations in industrial conditions hurt the laboring man more than any other because they frequently force upon him periods of idleness . If our manufacturers are put in position to take their share of the world 's markets , as they can be through the creation of a naval auxiliary merchant marine , it will help to bring about stable conditions in the great industries of this country , with steady and remunerative employment for labor and stabilized prosperity for our manufacturers . What is the real fight in this merchant marine controversy ? It is a fight for subsidies . What are subsidies ? They are gifts from the United States Treasury to favored corporations , firms , and individuals who operate ships . Why should we give away millions of dollars of the people 's money each year to favored ship-owners over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it be more sensible for the Government to spend these millions in building up a splendid naval auxiliary merchant marine which can be controlled and operated in the interest of all the people ? If we adopted the policy of subsidies , would n't corporations and individuals with the strongest and-longest pull get most of the money , as they always have done when free money has been distributed by the Treasury in the good old days of special privileges ? Of course every ship-owner and every ship monopolist want subsidies . They would profit by them and they are going to make a desperate fight for them . But they ca n't succeed , because no Democratic Congress will pass a ship subsidy bill and no Democratic President will approve one . The Democratic party is in control of the Government and is pledged by its platform and record against subsidies . Why , then , contend for the impossible ? Why not accept the only practical plan ? the creation by the Government of a naval auxiliary merchant marine with the money the subsidists want the Government to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform for a merchant marine created by Constitutional methods . To build a naval auxiliary and use it to create a naval reserve of officers and men and to build up American commerce is a Constitutional method . The claim is made that the Government should not provide the proposed steamship facilities because it will interfere with private enterprise . For the past fifty years the Government has given private capital the monopoly of the ocean transportation field . Private capital has failed to take advantage of its monopoly because it has not developed the necessary steamship lines . Should we continue any longer this monopoly in favor of private capital when it refuses to take advantage of it , and by so doing deprive our people of those facilities essential to their welfare and prosperity ? Shall this giant Nation , strong in resources , intelligence , and courage , sit impotently any longer and wait for indifferent private capital to build our naval auxiliaries and supply the marine facilities imperatively demanded for National preparedness and protection in time of war and for the welfare of our people and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may as well ask private capital to build our navy or hesitate to have a navy unless we can operate it at a profit . Let us think of our present opportunity ,
