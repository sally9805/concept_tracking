They are accused of murdering prominent Mexicans and of condoing robbery and pillage . In desperation , Gutierrez , according to his own account , was obliged to flee from the capital . He had sought aid from the Carranza forces , to help him resist the control that Villa and aapata had established over every branch of the Government . making Gutierrez a mere figurehead , and it is ' evident from the story told by the selfdeposed President that he feared that this action would be discovered , and that he would be put to death . The full text of the graphic narrative of Gutierrez was obtained tonight by THE NEW YORK TIMES . It was written by President Gutierrez on the eve of hi .1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of a proclamation or manifesto that Gen. Gutierrez promised to publish when he sent his three emissaries to Gen. Obregon and Aguilar with a proposition for combination with them and Gens . Robles and Blanco against the Villistas and Zapatistas . A copy of the Gutierrez proclamation , yliicia was not . prowulgated because Geo . Obre , gon arrested the emissaries.  - -  ** to the Carranza Government Vera . Cruz . Gen. Carranza today cabled the full text of tile Gutierrez proclamation to Senor Arredondo , chief et the Carranza agency in Washington , and itc contents nave been brought to the attention of Secretary Bryan . After reciting the manner in which ' Villa , after having received from President Gutierrez the appointment of chief of the Conventionist military forces . made himself independent of the President , the Villa describes the arrest by illa of Gen. Alberto Garcia Aragon . Governor of the National Palace , and continues : Immediately upon my knowledge 0 ' the arrest . I 3rdered Gen. Villa to re/ease him , and the latter promised to comply with 1ily orders : but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zapata. who ordered his eNeeution e. - ithout any formality of law . The forces of Gen. Zapata. pursuant to orders from him . took on the following ; light from the home of Gen. Aragon One of his servants to execute him also , menacing the family of the victim . which had to conceal itself to avoid further vegeanee . The Execution of Prof. Berlauxe. - Being completely wanting in forces who could obey an order of arrest ' against individuals who had thousands of men under their command , I was compelled to remain inactive in regard to the above-mentioned crime ; and only a few days later I was informed that another member of the convention , one of the most distinguished - because of his devotion and intelligence , Prof. David Berlange , had also been murdered a few nights before , having been taken out of the Restaurant Silvain by forces of Gen. Villa . In consideration of this new outrage , I called a meeting of the Cabinet in order to discuss the measures which should be adopted . " Although we were as helpless as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gen. Villa that we were all decided to cause the Government to be respected and to secure the punishment of those guilty of the above-mentioned assassinations . Before giving us a definite answer . Gen. Villa left the City of Mexico and went to Guadalajara , where he was guilty of similar crimes . Zapata had long since left the capital and for the time we decided to reserve punishment for the above crimes until such tine as the Government should be stronger . However , the members of the Aguascalientes convention , justly alarmed , informed me that they desired to change their residence to the city of San Luis Potosi. where there - were , though not very strong . sufficient elements to afford them safety . " A large number of the members of the convention proceeded to the above city , and Gen. Villa . having been informed by his agents of what had happened , had the audacity to issue orders of arrest and execution against persons whose immunity was absolute and who were the source from which Villa derived the authority with which he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegates in person , carrying the flag of the convention , called for protection on Gen. Antonio Villareal . Governor of Nuevo Leon . where they are at present awaiting an opportunity which may permit them to exercise their functions with dignity and freedom from the despotism of party leaders which seems to have taken possession of the country . tit Ferocious Military Dictatorship ' " A ferocious military dictatorship is the only semblance of government . There have been no elections nor municipal freedom , and one thing has been especially neglected , that is , ' the agraTian question , as , instead of distributing the land which had been despoiled and subdividing the latifundia. the system observed is that of giving protection to the general landowner in exchange for pensions paid by the latter to Gen. Zapata , who makes use of this money according to his own will , contrary to public interest , as the only justification a forced loans or any other incumbrance of property is that the money obtained be invested in public necessities . and that it he sent to the national Treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws to that effect . : . ? ? Still worse , if possible , is the administrative policy of Gen. Villa , who gor several months has been operating // GUTIERREZ HEADS A NEW REVOLT // the National Lines of Mexico , thus taxing the nation indefinitely , which some day will have to pay for the debauchery that has been raging . After I began my labors as Provisional President , I decided to adopt the necessary measures to cause the cessation of the military management of the railways and to allow them to pass into the hands of the company owning them , in which the Government has an important interest . " Nothing has been accomplished in this respect , in spite of the efforts that have been made , because the whole personnel appointed by Gen. Villa obeys only the orders coming from his military headquarters . " Another of the serious questions which concern the Government and the public in general is the problem of our paper money ; and to this date the Government under my direction has no knowledge of the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chihuahua , nor do we know what its limit is going to be . Much less do we know as to the use made of this money . " Gen. Villa , in his frequent conferences with representatives of the American press and with personages of the Government of that nation , makes declarations , promises , and pledges which are not within the province of a General , who should confine his attention exclusively to his military duties , inasmuch as it is contrary to national decorum that one who is only in command of a number of men should venture to talk , assuming the representation of the country in one form or another . fantierrez 's Life Threatened . " Villa , having learned that the acts of brigandage in this city and the murders committed in Pachuca and I other cities of the Republic by his troops did not meet the approval of this Government , a meeting was called which was attended by purely personal elements  --  that is , blind partisans of Villa  --  and at this meeting , which has been vainly characterized as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretly discussed , and decisions to which I was not . privy were adopted ; the result being that on Sunday , Dec. 31 , Gen. Villa came to my home , revolver in hand , accompanied by ten or twelve armed men , among them Fierro and lIrbina , besides 2,000 cavalrymen , who surrounded my house , and removed the meagre guard of twenty men , who were defending my home . With the courage instilled in them by such an array of force , all of them against one man . they insulted me , and several charges were preferred against me , because they had heard that it was my intention to deprive them of the command they had . ' In order to do this and to save my Government I have retired from the city , which they have been governing by military force and spreading terror and desolation everywhere . " There elements with me whose adhesion to the revolutionary cause is beyond discussion , and we all have a very different manner of understanding the revolution . We can not conceive it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the revolution has to kill , it ought to do it publicly and show- ? ing the justice of its action , ' basin- it strictly upon the law ; that when the revolution takes the property of others , it ought to do it also in accordance with general laws and for the benefit of the nation , but never for the personal enrichment of its chiefs , who levy forced loans or take the property of those whom they declare their enmies . " The country will not profit by this revolution if the latter does not direct all the great energies that are back of it toward a definite and honest orientation . With a just and upright Government , we can arrive at the solution of our economic problems ; the latitundia can be destroyed ? not through incumbrances that will perpetuate them , as has been done in Morelos , nor through arbitrary usurpations , as has been done in Chihuahua , because the latter can not be lasting and are subject to the changes of political events , but by means of laws which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right of ownership , prevent the acquisition of lands , and protect the small landowner against all outrages. , . even- those - of-  the revolution itself . Oh - Elie other hand , political freedom . which is the second important factor ofthe revolution , is at present in a more precarious condition than ever before in our history , and all this immense popular movement will be a failure , from the point of view of human freedom . " We do not have energy to shake off dictatorial systems brought about by the commanders of , large corps of force , who do not live within their province , but who prtend that they should impose their will . We ought to remember . therefore . that we have not only fought for bread in Mexico but also for freedom , and that all citizens should rally around a Government which seeks to safeguard the rights of all of us against every one and to establish a law which should be above everything as the only firm basis of our welfare and progress . Movement Against Carranza , Too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the Mexicans should be put to a test . They are at liberty to choose between a dictatorship more or less glowing , offered to them by the leaders from the North and South , and even by Senor Carranza , and a. democratic organization undertaken by the Government proposed by the Aguascalientes convention , which I am cbliged to maintain " I have hesitated to assume this attitude , which might be of serious consequences and which perhaps might drag us into further shedding of blood , because material force is on the side of those who have not respected the Government which they themselves formed . I have also thought that several Caranzista elements , bound to support one man , would take advantage of the division existing in the party representing legality , to continue the fight ; but , acting in accordance with the persons who constitute the Cabinet , and the feelings of many honest patriots whom I have also consulted , I have decided to take a road which may not be that of victory . but it is the one which honesty points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty . " Suported by this decision , adopted by the nation 's Government , I have seen fit to resolve the following : " First  --  Gen. Franacisco Villa shall cease in his command of the Northern Division and of all the forces which may have been under him , and with him shall also cease Gens . Tomas Urbina and Rodolfo Fiero . " Second  --  Gen. Emiliano Zapata shall also cease in his command of the forces which may be royal to the Convention and which may be under his command . And it is hereby made known by all military chiefs and by all armed elements of the country who may be loyal to the Government emanating from the Aguscalientes Convention that they shall obey the order : brought to the attention directly or indirectly by the War Department . Commissions shall at once proceed to bring the above decisions to the attention of such forces as have declined to recognize my government , because they demanded the retirement of Gen. Francisco Villa . and to request their assistance should it be necessary to enforce the above-mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obregon . The foregoing proclamation was to have been spread broadcast over Mexico If the letter which Gutierrez sent to Gen. Alvaro Obregon had received a favorable answer . That Carranza commander , however , remained loyal to the First Chief and detained the Provisional President 's emissaries. making public the Gutierrez letter and his rejection of its proposals . The text of the letter in question follows : From Mexico City . Jan. 17 , 191-x . Gens . Alvaro Obregon and Candido Aguilar , wnerever they may be . My Dear Colleagues : By virtue of a decision reached between Gens . Jose Robles , Minister of War ; Lucio Blanco . Minister of the Interior : Augenio Aguirre Benavides , Sub-Secretary of War , and myself , we believe it patriotic and honest to address you in order to point out the convenience of your suspending your advance toward this capital while we are formulating a plan of campaign that we intend to pursue against Gen. Francisco Villa , whom we have always had the intention of separating entirely from tile Conventionist Army and from all the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell from that delegates have arrived , here 1r0111 the statea of Mainaul/pao , Coa.tulla , Nuevo Leon ,  --  and San Luls Potosi , and have stated that the forces which are operating in those States are willing to support the attitude which this Government may assume against Villa , and that very few followers will second his policy of brigandage and desolation , because a number , of the honest chiefs of the Northern Division are also willing to cooperate with us . I desire to point out to you that it is not our intention to occupy the principal offices of our country , bat to us all of our activities , good-will , and patriotism to the end that peace may be restored in the land . To attain this end we are endeavoring to accomplish no exclusively personal ambitions , but are animated with the common desire to save our country from anarchy and ruin . I trust that as soon as this communication reaches your hands you will give me a reply , which I have no doubt will be agreeable to our purposes Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Overtures . Gen. Obregon ordered the arrest of the emissaries and made this reply to Gen. Gutierrez 's letter : Puebla , Jan. 12 , 1915 . Gen. Eulalio Gutierrez : My Dear Friend and Colleague : I have just received your communication of the 7th inst. , in which in your own name and in the names of Gen. Robles , Aguirre Benavides , and Blanco , you express the desire that our advance toward Mexico City should be suspended until you begin your campagn against Villa and the men who follow him in his work of brigandage and desolation . I am pleased to see that you have come to understand the justice of the fight we have waged from the beginning against the Villista faction , knowin4 that the worst crime that our history could record would be to enter into compromises with men who only serve as specimens of monstrosity , and you must now recall with pain that one of the strongest reasons we had as honest men to undertake this new fight was that you , disregarding the counsel of your friends , nullified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Operations . I can not arrest any of the military operations I am carrying into effect at this moment because this would be equivalent to betraying my brothers in arms who in different parts of the republic are fighting against the Villista reaction , among whom is your brother , who has the honor of having subordinated his dearest family affections to the sacred interests of his country . Whenever you , by your deeds , declare war against Villa and his followers and place yourself in the position that every honest Mexican should hold at this time , I shall endeavor to do everything in my power , as I have done in the past , to re-establish peace in our country : which is deserving of a better lot . But if you continue to pursue your ambiguos policy of vacillation and weakness , permitting the contry to be dragged to desolation and ruin , I do not believe this struggle should be stopped , because the welfare of our country hangs on its decision . Our lives are of small significance in such a scale : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I trust that when you have become convinced of the error which your letter clearly indicates you have discovered , you will not hesitate in assuming the attitude that honesty demands of you . I desire to inform you that I will not answer any further communications from you as long as you remain in league with the Villista factions . Affectionate greetings . ALVARO OBREGON . Garza Promises to Maintain Order . The State Department issued an announcement today , based on its official dispatches from Mexico City , detailing the circumstances of the flight of Provisional President Gutierrez . These show that he left the capital early on Saturday morning . The department announcement follows : " A telegram dated Jan. 16 , 9 A. M. , from Mexico City . states that all business houses are closed , an dthat there is some uncertainty as to what faction will control the city . Another telegram , sent 1 P. M. the same day , states that Gen. Garza issued a statement stating that in view of the fact that the metropolis bad been left without any authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending for its defense upon troops of the North and Zapatistas. all of whom are subject to orders of the convention . In this statement Gen. Garza said he would immediately issue a decree establishing martial law for the prevention of disturbances and for punishment of those committing crimes , and that his assumption of power would be ratified by the session of the sovereign convention to be held that afterroon . " ' Another telegram . senat at 6 P. M. the same day , states that the reason for the sudden departure of the Provisional Prsident and most of his Cabinet is still unknown . it has also been impossible to ascertain the point of their destination or the number of troops accompanying them . Minister Palafox has been appointed Military Commander . The Governor of the district and others still in control have given assurances that there is no cause for alarm , and that severe punishment will be meted to any disturbers . They state that sufficient troops for preservation of order are counted on by them , and that they anticipate no attack on the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiety on the part of the populace as to the general situation . " A telegram dated 9 A. M. Jan. 17 states that on the night of the lath the convention formally deposed the Provisional President and itself assumed charge of the Government . The President of the convention was named the executive of th convention . It is reported in Mexico City that about 5,000 troops and the Ministers of War , Government . and Public Instruction went with the former Provisional President . The city is reported well protected . There have been some arrests and excutions for disordr . " ELIAS DEFENDS OBREGON . Says He Would Kill Gutierrez , Not Co-operate with Him . Francisco Elias , the Carranzista purchasing agent in New York , who is an intimate friend of Gen. Alvaro Obregon , said last night that he was in a position to deny in the most positive terms that Obregon was concerned in any way in the new uprising said to be brewing in Mexico and to be directed against Carranza as well as Villa . " I am quite sure , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see poor Gutierrez . Once Obregon gets hold of him he will not have to . go to the trouble of discussing new revolts . It will be all over with him . All this talk df Gen. Obregon deserting the First Chief , Carranza , is nothing more than an attempt of the Villa clique to muddle the issue . Long before Gutierrez fled Mexico City we knew that he was kept Prisoner by Villa . Offers had been made to us to release him and thus get him to join the Carranza forces and have him openly renounce Villa . Gutierrez was willing and anxious to do so . But I am positive that none of Carranza 's Generals would have anything to do with him . The offer was rejected . Carranza has a splendid staff of Generals and does not need the aid of renegades . " From my private communications and conversations I had with him I can emphatically deny the statements that Obregon and Gutierrez are planning a ne wrevolt . Obregon is loyal to the First Chief of the revolution and the principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is fighting under the banner of the Constitutional Party because it is battling for justice and the Independence of the I Mexican people . The only thing Obre-gon would ever discuss with Gutierrez or any other Villa adherent , should he get hold of them , would be in what manner they wouldprefer to ' die ? by being shot or hanged .
