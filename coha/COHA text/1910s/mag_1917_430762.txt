 | I. THE RUSSIAN BREAKDOWN THREE events of major importance have marked the August history of the World War . These are the Russian breakdown , the new British offensive , in which the French have taken an important but relatively subordinate part , and the peace proposal of the Pope . I shall discuss them in the order of their occurrence , which is , perhaps , the order of their importance . The Russian breakdown came as a surprise to the world which had been once more filled with optimistic reports and taken in by the initial successes of the new Russian offensive in Galicia . My readers will recall that two months ago I warned them that Russia could no longer be counted upon in the military operations of the year , because of the disorganization of Russian armies incident to the Revolution . Last month , again , in the face of superficial successes of the Russians I again advised against too great expectations . Unhappily these warnings have now been fully justified and it is essential to recognize that Russia will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . Now the consequences of this fact are plain . First of all it is not only patent that there can be no military decision on any front in the present year , but also that the Allies have already accepted this fact and their operations are designed rather to continue a maximum of pressure upon the Western front than to seek a decision with the resources in their hands . And this means but one thing , it means that the Allies feel that they will not have the man power necessary until the armies of the United States arrive . It means that the United States will have to share in the decisive campaign and that this campaign will come in 1918 , not in 1917 . Russian failure has very clearly enlarged and expanded American duties and American participation in the actual fighting . By reason of the Russian failure the Germans have been able to concentrate the great bulk of their men , their guns , their munitions in Belgium and Artois ; they have been able to leave but a few and inferior troops in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paralyzing effect of rapidly diminishing reserves and slowly declining artillery resources . Had Russia been able to repeat her great performance of last year , her victories from June to September , there is little reason to question that we should have had this year , either a collapse of the German western front due to an attempt to hold lines too long for the available man-power , or a retreat of such magnitude as to disclose the actual . condition of the German military establishment . The very retirement of the early spring was a partial confession , it was a patent attempt to avoid battle this year , to postpone an Allied attack by compelling the Allies to begin their preparations all over again on the new front and thus gain time for the submarine to accomplish its mission . The German retreat was largely successful in postponing the Allied offensive , although not wholly . But we must note that the submarine failed in its mission ; the time gained by the German retreat has not enabled the German undersea craft to bring Britain to her knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month indicate that not only is the submarine toll diminishing , but that the British Government is now confident that the submarine can not next year accomplish what it has failed to bring to pass this year . German salvation this year has come on land ; it has come by the Russian collapse . The situation is as if in 1864 the armies operating in the West , the Union armies , had been suddenly thrown into disorder and rendered temporarily incapable of offensive operations , thus permitting the South to send  | its troops facing Sherman and Thomas to the trench lines before Richmond , where Grant and Lee were deadlocked . Had this taken place there would have been no decision in the spring of 1865 . And for the same reason there can hardly be a decision in the present war this year . Germany has no longer the troops , the numbers to man the east and west fronts at their present extent in such fashion as to meet great offensive operations by the AngloFrench forces and by the Russian at the same time . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn the Russian collapse into a complete ruin ; she could not even prevent the gradual reconstitution of the routed and fleeing hordes and the establishment of a new front . What reserves , what resources she has , have been concentrated on the west front in a death struggle , with the conviction that if the German lines can hold until winter , peace by negotiation will save Germany . I believe the German lines can hold sufficiently until winter to prevent a disaster and then the peril of peace by negotiation will be plain . No one should mistake the utter change in the character of the war . No one should mistake the fact that Germany is now engaged in a desperate defensive with no other hope or purpose than that to hold on until war weariness brings peace by negotiation . Recall that it is just three years ago that German armies were sweeping on to Paris , that Tannenberg was happening , that the French Government had fled to Bordeaux , that the British had been defeated at Mons and Le Cateau , the French at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to celebrate that Sedan Day which was one of the most marvelous moments in the history of any nation or race . And now after three years German armies on the western front are far removed from Paris and everywhere on the defensive , everywhere either yielding ground or striving by bloody counter-attacks to win back posts of great value recently lost . Nearly 75,000 German prisoners and more than 500 guns have been captured by the victorious French and British armies in the present campaign . Here is a measure of the turn of the tide , here is a measure that we must all keep in mind , even when the slowness of Allied progress suggests a permanent stalemate . Germany is fighting magnificently . No one can deny admiration to the enemy who is , in the face of great odds and failing resources , making a tremendous resistance , but the thing that must be recognized equally is that the fight is going against the German and that his salvation this year is found in the Russian collapse . When his reserves were well-nigh exhausted , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armies and in this resource he has found his temporary salvation . II . WHAT HAPPENED TO RUSSIA Now as to the actual story of the Russian breakdown . Last month we left the Russian armies south of the Dniester sweeping forward at some points , but still , in the main , halted by Austro-German efforts along the line of the Lomnica River , southeast of Lemberg and west of Stanislau . Halicz had been taken , Kalusz taken and lost ; the moment had come when this fight had reached a crisis . Before there could be any determination of this battle , the whole Russian line north of the Dniester before Tarnopol and northward to the Lemberg-Brody railroad suddenly collapsed . There was no considerable German attack , there was no great engagement , but a panic , a rout ensued . German spies , German agents , anarchists and warweary and deluded soldiers united in the destruction of discipline , and the army which had taken Koniuchy and threatened Brzezany two weeks ago was suddenly transformed into a fleeing horde , comparable to that army which set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even in this situation the German forces were unable to follow up the rabble and deal with it decisively . After a flight that extended to the Russian frontier the rally came . At last new troops and old troops disgusted with the performance returned to the charge , the Russian line was restored , and stood and stands at the frontier . But the retreat had surrendered the lines of the Sereth , all the ground won by the offensives of July 14 , 16 , and 17 . And the effect of this collapse of the Russian center in Galicia was to leave the victorious army south of the Dniester in the air . It had no choice but to fall rapidly back for a hundred miles through Bukovina to the Russian boundary , surrendering all of Bu. kovina and all of Galicia held since the opening of the campaign of last year . When the rearrangement was complete the Austrians once more could boast a soil practically  | freed of the invader and this had not been the case since the very opening days of the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wretched performance . Official German figures placed the captures , up to mid-August from Rumania to the Bug , at only 42,000 men and 257 guns . In their offensives in April the British and French together had captured over 55,000 German prisoners and more than 400 guns . The Russians in their first two weeks this year , while the armies still fought , had taken 36 , - 000 prisoners and captures in Rumania brought the balance even for the two forces on the Southeastern front . Compare this with 150,000 Austrian prisoners taken by the Russians after Lemberg in 1914 or 120,000 prisoners after the capture of Lutsk last year . The loss of guns was more serious , but the real disaster was the destruction of the cohesion of the Russian armies . At a critical moment the inevitable effect of the domestic agitations had been felt and Germany had been saved from deadly peril , the peril flowing from the opening of a joint attack in the east and in the west . She could now concentrate her attention upon Belgium and Artois , for even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the campaigning season it was beyond possibility that they could conduct a new offensive . And with this collapse we see Brusiloff , the greatest of Russian generals , give way to Korniloff ; we see Kerensky and the new members of the Cabinet joining in drastic and far-reaching policies to restore discipline , and we see what promises to be a recrudescence of national sentiment and reasoned patriotism in Russia . The situation as the month ends is far better than when it opened . A Russo-Rumanian campaign in the fragment of Rumania left to its people has inflicted heavy losses , captured many prisoners , and temporarily checked a great counteroffensive of Marshal von Mackensen . Yet it is unwise to expect much . Russia may presently find herself . She may discover a Carnot , as did Revolutionary France . We can see that if anything of the sort happens . Russia will be a tremendous element in the campaign of 1918 . But , on the other hand , Russia may again fall victim to German intrigue and national disorganization . The truth is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west . It is in Belgium and Northern France that the lantly but only in a relatively minor measure by their French allies , was the destruction of German man-power by the same sort of pounding that had made the Somme so terrible , a pounding bound to be less expensive for the British than the Germans because of the superiority of the British both in guns and in munitions . And it was a significant turn of affairs that after three years the Germans should be compelled to face on the same ground what the British had suffered at the First Battle of Ypres , where they were outgunned and outnumbered . IV . THE RESULTS TO AUGUST 20 Measured by ground gained the British did not win at Ypres a much larger victory than on the first day of the Somme a year before . While the French crossed the Yser Canal and retook Steenstrate , Het Sas , and Bixschoote , the British took Pilkem and the Pilkem Ridge , crossed the Steenback , and reached but could not take Langemarck , took but could not hold St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included Hooge and Hollebeke near the Menin Road , and gained the positions sought southward to the Lys . On the average the British and French had advanced about a mile on a front of some fifteen miles .

Here e and is a measure of present conditions between ctory the two great rivals in the West . n the V. ENGLAND 'S PRESENT EFFORT Britsfully It is perhaps an appropriate time to call beek , attention to the fact that at the present time ibeck , the main work is being done by the British . rach- In the Marne operation and in all the first armed campaign of the war the British share was Poly- small , useful as it was , and magnificent as helu was the British stand at Ypres . A year able later the new British army just coming on the was still incapable of a mighty effort and the educe French , first in the offensive in Champagne thou- and then in the desperate defensive at Verguns , dun , were compelled to carry on , only in part f this aided by the British .  | first-line positions attacked and some of the second , but they had lost ground in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fury recalling the April fighting at Arras . Despite these counter attacks the British presently retook St. Julien , Westhoeck , and Verlorenhock and retained Frezenberg . Actually the operation ended with a success on all points save in the center , but this was the most important point of all . Here the Germans clung to the maze of defenses which covered Zonnebeke , Gheluvelt , and the Polygon woods between these two points . Right and left the British had , save about Langemarck , established the front of October , 1914 , but they had not gained control of the famous Zandvorde Ridge , the extension of the high ground of the Messines Ridge , and the last good position remaining to the Germans , now that Pilkem Ridge had passed like " White Sheet " to hostile control . Six thousand prisoners and a modest number of guns were the booty of the British in this attack , a smaller bag than that gained at Messines and hardly a quarter the profit drawn from the Arras " show . " But the ground gained had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of the Somme and the British now began to reveal their new method ? a method first seen at Messines , on the British front , a method that called for enormous artillery preparation , short advances , and then the consolidation of ground gained . French losses at the Aisne in April , where too much had been sought at one time , had proven a valuable lesson . Save for a small area in the center , the British attained all their objectives in this attack ; the French reached all of theirs , but the Germans , alleging that the Allies had sought remote and impossible objectives , claimed a great victory and announced the end of the battle . This was a dangerous all the south bank of St. Jansbeek , to the point of confluence of the Broenbeck , together with the bridgehead of Drei Grachten , while the British successfully stormed Langemarck and made progress in the Polygon woods between Zonnebeke and Gheluvelt . Yet once more the Germans were able to retake ground in this sector along the Menin Road and by counter-attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoners and some twenty-five guns , some of them heavy , were the reward of this  | ever beyond suspicion his motives and however sincere his desire to restore peace and end the world agony , had uttered a document which , since it did not provide for the indemnification of Belgium , was unacceptable . The additional suggestions of disarmament and arbitration were regarded as Utopian hopes , while the nation which had declined arbitration and invaded Belgium in defiance of international law and pledged faith could not be trusted as a member of a council of nations . To the world the Pope 's suggestions seemed , not through design but in point of fact , advantageous to the Germans and the Austrians and far short of the proposals that must become the base of any successful offer of mediation . It was felt that Belgium could not be left in ruins , after a German invasion , without establishing in the world the fact that a small nation which defended its liberty against aggression would be ruined without hope of redress . To permit this would be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again by the Belgian road . Nor was there any conception of how it would be possible to dispose of the questions of Poland , Alsace-Lorraine , or Italia Irredenta by any peaceful negotiation with a Germany many of whose public men and a number of whose influential and inspired newspapers still proclaimed a policy of annexation in Belgium , Poland , and the Near East . That Vienna , through its close sympathy with the Vatican , had played an influential role in the procedure and that Erzberger and the German Catholics were also parties to the proposal in some manner , were conclusions drawn in all Allied capitals ; where the personal good faith and honest intent of the Pope himself were at the same time equally conceded . There was a general feeling that the Pope must have had certain intimations from Berlin that his suggestions would not be rejected out of hand , and even more definite declarations from Vienna . Yet , as I have said , writing on August 19 , every sign points to a rejection of the present proposal , and there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allied nations to continue the struggle until a more solid and enduring basis of peace can be found . Actually the proposal carried with it a certain amount of reassurance to the Allied publics , for it was accepted as a new sign of the war weariness in Berlin and Vienna and the new desire for peace on terms far removed from the old suggestion , based upon the war map , made by Bethmann-Hollweg so long ago . The announcement made by Lloyd George , fortified by the first official statistics , that the submarine war had failed and that the losses were steadily shrinking was accepted as a new evidence of the desperateness of the German situation and as a new explanation of the German readiness to talk peace on the basis of 1914 . So far as one can judge now , it is the settled belief in London , Paris , Rome , and also in Washington that the war will go into 1918 , that there will be one more campaign , from April at least until midsummer , and that this campaign will see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my own personal view , but I warn my readers to watch the events of the winter months with very great care , for it is beyond doubt that in those months Germany will make the most desperate peace offensive in her history and that every possible effort will be made to prevent the opening of a new campaign which threatens the defeat of the German army and the extinction of tradition of invincibility which is the foundation of militarism in the German Empire . Personally I expect to see far greater concessions offered by Germany before next spring , but not concessions which will include all of AlsaceLorraine or give Italy Trieste as well as the Trentino. operation , the artillery booty being heavier than in the first attack . Again the fighting was of the most desperate order and again the advance was relatively slight , and this enabled the Germans to proclaim a new victory . Meantime a new attack had broken out north of Lens on the slopes of the famous Hill 70 , taken by the Scottish troops in the tragic days of the Battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff work . After the familiar artillery preparation the Canadians advanced to the summit and over the crest of the hill , took all the German trenches and made material progress both on the east and the south sides , tightening the noose about Lens . It was now clear that unless German counter-attacks could oust the Canadians , Lens would have to be evacuated . Accordingly the Germans made some of the most desperate efforts of the whole campaign , hurling large bodies of troops again and again against the Canadians , but on August 19 , when these lines are written , the Canadians still hold fast to Hill 70 . Thus , between April and the present date the British have been able to drive the Germans off the Vimy Ridge , off Hill 70 , off the Messines Ridge and the Pilkem Ridge . Only at La Bassee and directly east of Ypres the Kaiser 's armies still cling to any portion of the high ground occupied by them at the beginning of the year . They have lost strongholds , they have lost valuable observation posts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lost more than 50,000 prisoners and nearly 300 guns to the British , while in the whole war they have taken less than 35,000 British prisoners and 96 guns . Here is a measure of present conditions between the two great rivals in the West . V. ENGLAND 'S PRESENT EFFORT It is perhaps an appropriate time to call attention to the fact that at the present time the main work is being done by the British . In the Marne operation and in all the first campaign of the war the British share was small , useful as it was , and magnificent as was the British stand at Ypres . A year later the new British army just coming on was still incapable of a mighty effort and the French , first in the offensive in Champagne and then in the desperate defensive at Verdun , were compelled to carry on , only in part aided by the British .  | At the Somme the proportions began to change , but even at the Somme it was the French that made the first considerable gain , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense of Verdun had still to be maintained . But with the Battle of Arras in April of this year , the British practically took over the main task of the western offensive . The British task was materially increased when the French attack at the Aisne failed to make decisive progress and incurred enormous casualties . To-day the British are doing the main job on the West . It is no reproach upon the French that this is so , as the French have certainly done their share and more than their share . Yet it is only just to the British to recognize that they are making the big sacrifice now after delays that were long , but were inevitable , given British unpreparedness , and are becoming more comprehensible to the American people now that we are struggling with the problem that confronted Britain three years ago . The British have arrived and it is the British armies that are delivering the heavy blows . The measure of the British effort is not the respective fronts held by British and French armies , but the amount of action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year three considerable British attacks ? the Arras battle , which was the most successful in size and ground gained of any western attack , one of the most successful in artillery captured in the history of the war , the retaking of the Messines Ridge , and now the new offensive in the Ypres sector . With these three , one should perhaps class the Hill 70 exploit of the Canadians , which was brilliant and of permanent value . If anyone ever doubted that the British would arrive , these doubts have been answered . Britain is now paying the price that France paid over two bloody years . Her artillery has seized and maintained the mastery over the German . Slowly , steadily , surely the British are breaking down the material and the moral resources of Germany . Because the Russians collapsed the chance of a decision this year has been banished , but the British strategy is that of Grant , is that of wearing down , and there are unmistakable signs that the Germans are beginning to weaken , although their resistance must still command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the great campaigns of the war . It already shows greater power than that at the Somme and it is not marred by the early blunders of that former battle . The Somme " show , " as the British call it , was the training school of the new British army . It was expensive , it was bloody , it was protracted , but the results were visible at the end ; they were discoverable in the Beaumont Hamel victory last autumn and in the Arras offensive this year . To-day the British army is unmistakably the finest army in the world . All the other nations suffer from the loss of the younger and physically fitter men . The British have still a considerable share of their youth left and the flower of the manhood of Great Britain and the Colonies is now suffering and achieving as did the flower of the French at the Marne and at Verdun . To-day the British have taken over the main task from the French ; they have also had to assume much of the Russian work . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when American troops are available in considerable numbers for the final campaign . Then France , too , will be able to spend reserves ; a new class will have come on the field . But until America arrives the British task will be of great importance to the Allied cause . Meantime the character of this task is not to be mistaken . The British are not seeking this year the decision which Russian failure has postponed . They are simply striving to continue the pressure and the pounding , to permit no moment of relaxation and recuperation to the Germans until Russia recovers , which is a hope , and until America arrives , which is a reasonable expectation . VI . THE PAPAL OVERTURE Stripped of all else the Papal peace proposal made late in August amounts to the suggestion that the world return to the situation of 1914 , with the additional suggestion that the questions of Poland , AlsaceLorraine and of Italia Irredenta be settled by some peaceful method . Belgium is to be evacuated , but not indemnified ; the same with Northern France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than specified . So far as one may judge , the Pope 's proposal is doomed to failure unless it be fortified by some new German and Austrian proposal with little delay . By all the Allied nations it was received politely but coldly , by all it was felt that the Holy Father , howdestiny of Europe must be again decided , and for this fight the Russian collapse has released German divisions and supplied a new cause for optimism to the German people . More than all else , perhaps , the Russian breakdown strengthened the hand of the reactionaries in Germany , who prevailed in the recent crisis . Thus , one can say without exaggeration that the consequences of the peace propaganda in Russia have added another year to the war . III . THE BRITISH OFFENSIVE On August 1 , one month later than their attack at the Somme last year , the British began a wide offensive operation . This year , at last , they were aided by French forces operating on one flank , this time the northern flank . The blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the great western operation of 1917 . The ground selected for the attack is familiar to the readers of battle news during the past three years . On , a front from the Lys to the Yser , over ground that had been fought for in October and November , 1914 , in April and May , 1915 ( that is , in the great battles of First and Second Ypres ) , the British advanced . Their attack was heralded by the greatest artillery bombardment in human history . In London itself the grumble of the guns was plainly audible and not only was the bombardment the heaviest on record but it was also the longest sustained . As the British and French lines stood , when the operation began , the French occupied the lines to which their own troops , colonials , had been driven after the " poison gas " attack of 1915 ; that is , they stood behind the Yser Canal , from the region where the inundation of 1914 still endured down to the famous Poelkapelle road , notorious in the official reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British line extended in a shallow circle two miles or more north and east of Ypres round to the Messines or " White Sheet " Ridge , retaken in the offensive of some weeks ago . The immediate objectives of the British were the Pilkem Ridge and the crossings of Steenback Stream , with the villages of Langemarck and St. Julien , lost when the French had collapsed under the gas attack in 1915 . The French objectives were also the lost ground on their  | front , Steenstrat and Het Sas across the canal and the triangle of land between the Canal and the St. Jansbeck River , together with the bridgehead , where the Yser Canal joins this stream at Drei Grachten . Westward , the objectives of the British center were the works and villages on the high ground of the Grafenstafel Ridge between Langemarck and the Menin Road , the northern end of the battlefield of the first great Battle of Ypres , which defeated the German effort to reach Calais . On the right , between the Menin Road and the Lys the objectives were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lost in 1914 and not recovered in the earlier attack upon the Messines Ridge this year . Behind these immediate objectives lay the remoter goals sought when Sir John French had come north in 1914 ? the Menin road to the crossing of the Lys at this town , Roulers , with its railroad and roads , the point vital to the easy communication between the two adjoining German sectors . At Menin the British would threaten the German hold upon Lille ; at Roulers the French would menace the whole German position in the region between the Lys and the sea . Finally , an advance between the Lys and the sea , comparable with that achieved during and after the Battle of the Somme last year and last spring , would carry with it the German evacuation of the Belgian seacoast , the destruction of the submarine base at Zeebrugge , and the protection of Britain against air raids such as had grown frequent in recent months . Here , in a word , were the immediate and the remoter possibilities of the new operation . Yet beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the collapsing Russians by preventing the detachment of German reserves to the east to gather the profits of Russian weakness and the equal necessity to keep a never-ending pressure upon the Germans and to seek by wasting their rapidly diminishing reserves to prepare the way for a successful attack in 1918 , when America should arrive , and it would be possible to undertake a general offensive such- as had been planned for the present year and postponed by the Russian collapse . Beside this last purpose all else was minor . The capture of ground was relatively immaterial ; even the advance to the coast was less important , however useful . The chief objective of the British , aided gal-@@430763  | WE have been raising potatoes in America for several generations , but in the light of what is happening and what will happen before our 1917 war crop of this food has been consumed , I am thoroughly convinced that we are just on the threshold . of a thorough understanding of this industry . From farmer to ultimate consumer the American public is beginning to rediscover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potatoes ? yes , something like 350,000,000 bushels of them annually ? and suddenly a war emergency spurred our growers to increasing their acreage to a point where at present there is in sight about 117,000,000 bushels above the average crops for 1911 to 1916 . And this in the face of an average consumption of only 2.6 bushels per capita . Before the war , Germany consumed 9.4 bushels per capita ; England , 8.3 bushels ; France , 7.7 bushels . The natural inference here is that , in order to make this ' war crop a success , the per capita consumption must be raised to take care of the increased per capita production on the farm . For it is a safe guess that the production per acre has not increased . Each farmer planted more acres to potatoes ? that 's all . The problem of increasing consumption is open at both ends and must not be attacked at its middle . While on one hand we must launch a campaign among consumers to educate them in a full appreciation of the value of the potato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage just as aggressive a campaign among producers , to the end that they learn to produce potatoes not merely to sell but to eat . We have not gained a national reputation for high yields of high-quality potatoes . These reputations are for the most part severely localized . Nor , as a whole class of farmers , have we developed great efficiency in handling the crop from field to market . As a bit of cold fact , the per-acre product tion of potatoes in America is the lowest in the world . And this is due solely to the fact that we do not sufficiently fortify our soils with the fertility necessary to stand any great increase . Soil fertility and simple mathematics are the answers to increased production . An acre measures 210 feet square . Potato rows three feet apart are in number seventy to the acre ; if the hills are three feet apart , the total number of hills will be 4900 . And with our average soil , that 's about as heavily as they can be planted . In Maine , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the acre , they plant their rows three feet apart , but their hills are set one foot apart . This gives a total of 14,500 hills to the acre . Abroad , where the question of fertility is so carefully considered that potatoes are grown only one year in six on the same land , they plant between 24,000 and 26.000 hills to the acre . In 1911 , Matthew Wallis was knighted by King George V for having raised 119,800 pounds of potatoes to the acre . Astounding ?  | Well , he put his land into such condition that it could stand 36,000 hills to the acre , that 's all . And that 's all there is to our problem of increasing production . Our emergency crop , then , consists of some 717,000 additional acres planted to the potato . The President 's appeal to the farmers for this effort came at a time when labor , seed , and fertilizers were abnormally high in price . The consequence has been that the war crop is from poor seed , poorly nourished after planting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the game are two : grading , distribution . By grading I mean the exercise of scrupulous care by the farmer to see that nothing but the very best stock from his fields is sent out to the public . While the public is being educated to use more potatoes , unless the market offerings are prime , tempting tubers , there is little more than apathy to be looked for in response to this campaign among consumers . At the same time it is all too plain that poor stock coming into the market will upset it and depress prices to a degree ruinous to producers . Again , rigid grading is absolutely essential if the American farmer is to avail himself of the opportunity offered by the member banks of the Federal Reserve System . Under a recent ruling , potatoes when carefully graded and stored in approved storage houses constitute a staple commodity , warehouse receipts for which will be discountable by member banks for ninety-day periods at a rate not to exceed 6 per cent. , including all costs . It will be ruinous to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foods if prices break below a point where the increased cost of producing this crop will not be taken care of . A case in point : During the first ten days in August wholesale prices for potatoes on the New York market ranged from $1.25 to $2.62 per 100 pounds . Inspectors ' reports from points of origin of this stock showed that the lowest level was reached when little or no effort was made to send out a strictly graded product . - Just as soon as the growers united for better grading , the prices rose . In one famous potato section the price this year went to $2.25 a barrel , because of the poor quality of the offerings . Strict grading sent the price overnight to $3.85 , with the demand exceeding the supply . The second problem is that of securing an equitable distribution for the crop . This means that a food crop requiring six weeks to harvest must be handled so as to furnish food for nine months at prices equitable to producer and consumer alike . As I see it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to achieve that end . The railroad companies , congested as is their traffic , have given us assurance that unless unforeseen conditions arise , they can move one-third of the crop . If this one-third is moved to the market and absorbed by dealers and retailers , to be released from their storage as demand requires , then if the growers themselves will , store one-third on their farms or in municipal storage , and store the remaining third in approved warehouses under the ruling of the Federal Reserve Board , the whole problem will be a problem no more . Neither the Food Administration nor any other branch of the Federal Government can work this out singlehanded . The situation is one calling for the closest cooperation of every factor interested in the potato crop , from the farmer himself to the housewife in the city . And this cooperation has been promised ? already is forthcoming . It did not have to be solicited . The farmers , bankers , merchants , shippers , wholesalers , retailers , consumers ' organizations , have come of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to Mr. Hoover have said : " Here we are . Whatever you need in this crisis that we can supply , is yours . You can have our time , our energy , our organizations . We 're here to put our shoulders to the wheel whenever you give the word . " Such spirit , such red-blooded patriotism can and will not only move a war crop of potatoes , but move mountains . And I look to see it result in the most equitable distribution and disposition of our potato crop , that has ever been recorded in the annals of our economic life . And when this country has come through this ordeal , I look for the breaking of an al together new day in agriculture and its innumerable ramifications , not only in the case of the potato , but in the case of everything that is grown in the soil .
