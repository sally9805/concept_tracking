txt Standing Within the shadow of the gallows to which. ; Austrian . eourt-diartials , , . now being held at Marmarosz-Sziget , in Hungary , may consign them , 114 Polish officers and soldiers ' who led an armed revolt in the Austrian Army in February have issued an appeal to the Polish people throughout the w ) rld begging them not to compromise the freedom of Poland with the idea of obtaining mercy for them . The men under court-martial include eighty-eight officers and twenty-six privates . They are part of the Polish Carpathian Iron Brigade which revolt- , ed , seized arms and provisions , and marched from Bukowina into Bessarabia under command of General Haller . Part of the force was captured by Germans , but the larger portion has since consolidated with the Czechoslovak Army . General Haller made his way I to Paris after the consolidation and is now planning for the ' mobilization of all Polish troops in Russia to serve with the allied armies in Russia . Their revolt , the prisoners declare , was deliberately undertaken with the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military men , they appreciated fully that a disgraceful death would be their fate in the event of their rebellion failing . Their distress at this time is not over the death penalty or the manner in which it is to be executed but over the rumors that the Polish Deputies in the Austrian Parliament and members of the Polish nationality in Austria and Germany , whose sympathies have been aroused , are in danger of compromising the fight for Polish freedom with the idea of obtaining a mitigation of their respective sentences . Plead to De Left to Their Fate . " The fear that torments us , " they write in the memorial to the Polish nation , " is that the real Polish strength , so vital to the success of our holy cause , may be lessened by the attempts of our political representatives in the Austrian Parliament to secure for us relief , or to avert the fate that awaits us . " It is , therefore , in our name and that of our soldiers that we plead ardently with the Polish nation which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cognizance of our words and to desist from exercising any influence in our case upon the Polish Parliamentary Club in Austria . If they make any attempt to secure concessions for us , it will be contrary to our wishes , for we know that such concessions can only be had by pledges , compromises and commitments , which will make to the detriment of the Polish nation and the lessening of the strength of the battle for Polish freedom and independence . " These memorials have just been received at the office of the Associated Polish Press with the request that the messages contained therein be made known to the Polish immigraps in the United States with whom many of the . officers and soldiers have blood relationship . The memorial to the Polish Parliamentary Club in Vienna , with which the Austrian Government has been trying to open negotiations offering to exchange the lives of these Polish patriots for the votes of the Polish Deputies in ? the Reichsrat , is almost epic in its wordings . The memorial , dated at the camp of the Polish prisoners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the club , reads in part as follows : For four years , against disappointments and discouragetnents , and amid treacherous friendships , we stood unfalteringly , hoping to achieve the freedom of our Motherland , and to that end we were willing to make any and all sacrifices . Again and again , our hearts were tried by the moves of those who claimed to be our friends , but we have persisted . " The Brest-Litovsk peace treaty , which aimed to separate from our Motherland territory won through ages of martyrdom and held by , ties of blood ( the Government of Cholm in Poland , which Austria agreed to give to the Ukraine ) was , however , a vital thrust and a final blow to the remainder of our already tried soldierly faith and hope . " It was this pact which convinced us that it was possible no longer for us to continue within the Austrian Army , and strictly in accordance with the requirements of a soldier 's honor , we decided to continue the battle for our Motherland 's freedom , but ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision was the result of deep premeditation . No one depended upon a pardon , nor did any one intend to plead for forbearance or forgiveness in the event of defeat . As Polish nationalists our move was adeliberate demonstration in protest against an outrage . We elected to become formal partners in the general Polish manifestation . As men experienced in warfare , and its usages , we selected a portion of the national battle line which belonged to us . " And now we receive , indirectly , the news that awakens fear in us that concern over our fate is present to weaken the resistance and the decided stand taken by the official Polish representation , in ' the face of the governments that dismembered our country . It is said that we are threatened with the danger that the Polish Parliamentary Club , in consideration of a modification of our sentence , might be compelled to lessen the strength of the opposition and to agree to make concessions in the sphere of the general Polish political policies . " We value greatly our compatriots ' love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country thought of us , but we desire to protest most energetically against relief and concessions secured for us , to the detriment of the country , by making concessions as to the ancient rights of our nation . It was our ambition to make of ourselves a power in the hands of the highest Polish authority and , in in full consciousness and realization of the role we assumed , we cast unfalteringly into the lot our greatest asset , the fame of a Polish soldier , established upon his blood and that most beautiful legend of a Polish Army reborn . " You are not to injure us with gifts requiring too , great concessions . Do not permit our personal lot to weaken the united Polish front , for the verdict and death penalty can affect us only physically . The sufferings undergone by our grandfathers and fathers we will continue as a national obligation , without complaint and resentment , and with this sincere conviction that we are serving a free , united and independent Poland . " The verdict to ' be given by ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we await that verdict with ooniiOnce. "
