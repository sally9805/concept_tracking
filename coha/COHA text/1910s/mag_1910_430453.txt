 | UNTIL 1906 the main object of Federal regulation of railways was the extirpation of secret discrimination . The enforcement of the Elkins law and the passage of the Hepburn act in 1906 killed railway rebating . It seems improbable that it will ever be revived . Two other problems of railway regulation of importance equal to the suppression of rebating , and of greater complexity , have now pressed to the front . One is the problem of establishing fair and satisfactory relations between the freight rates of rival producing and distributing communities . While the Interstate Commerce law now prohibits every form of secret discrimination , it prohibits only public discrimination which gives an " undue or unreasonable preference or advantage " to a person or a community . The long and short haul clause even permits a higher rate to be charged for a shorter than for a longer haul when the " circumstances and conditions " of the hauls are " substantially dissimilar . " Now , there are all degrees of dissimilarity between the " circumstances and conditions " of transportation . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had in mind ? There are various forms and degrees of discrimination between localities . When , exactly , do they become " undue and unreasonable " ? Conditions in the United States make these queries very hard to answer . The second important question arises from the Hepburn act empowering the Commission to reduce rates that are excessive . It is exceedingly difficult to say when a rate is excessive . Does it become so when it brings in more than the current rate of interest to the railway ? Or when it brings in more than the ordinary commercial profit ? Or does it become excessive only when it puts an unreasonable burden on the shipper ? These two great problems are met in their most complicated and refractory form in the territory west of the Missouri River ; and differences over them there between the shippers and the railways have led to the greatest battle over freight rates ever fought in the United States . This struggle involves all the freight rates from all points on and east of a line drawn from the Canadian boundary through St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the Gulf of Mexico , to practically all points west of that line . It involves all freight rates from all points on the Pacific Coast into a territory extending eastward from the coast about eight hundred miles . Its result will settle whether or not the earnings of the roads concerned shall be reduced many millions of dollars annually . It will settle how the manufacturers and jobbers of the East , of the Middle West , of the Western intermountain country , and of the Pacific Coast shall divide the making and selling of the finished products consumed in all of the territory west of St. Paul , Minn. , and the Missouri River , with its fast-growing wealth and population . The struggle is now going on before the Interstate Commerce Commission . But the interests of the combatants are so diverse and incompatible and the principles of rate-making that they seek to have applied so irreconcilable , that the sequel is pretty sure to be litigation in which the Federal Supreme Court will be asked to rule with finality on the question which is really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixing the " reasonable " rates which the law requires , the railways and the Commission shall use as the main touchstone of reasonableness the cost incurred by the railway in rendering the transportation service , or the value of that service to those to whom it is rendered . The complaining shippers ask the Commission to make general reductions in rates . The railways contend that under the Hepburn act it can only change specific *rates which have been specifically shown to be  | unduly discriminatory or excessive . If the Commission tries to make general reductions , the roads undoubtedly will challenge its powers in the Federal courts . The result of the contest is likely to influence greatly the future of government regulation of railways , and perhaps even the future of American railway transportation . The adjustment of freight rates in the West has long been the object of attack . The main reason is that it ignores distance to a greater extent and with more seeming arbitrariness than any other scheme of rates in the world . It has not been created , as is sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolved in an environment of unusual industrial , commercial , and transportation conditions . We shall understand it better after a glance at its history . The historical method of investigation often explains what it can not justify . Sometimes it explains and justifies what at first seemed neither explicable nor justifiable . Formerly the only practicable means of transportation from the eastern part of the United States to the extreme western part was by water around Cape Horn . In 1854 the Panama Railroad was built . After that goods were carried by water from New York to Colon ; by rail from Colon to Panama ; and by water from Panama to San Francisco . The first transcontinental railway was finished in 1869 by the completion at Ogden , Utah , of the Central Pacific from the west and the Union Pacific from the east . In that primitive period of railway history the traffic manager knew only one principle of rate-making . He " charged what the traffic would bear . " He did not mean by this that he charged all that the existing traffic would bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to develop more was his main object . He meant that he charged all he could without hampering the movement or growth of traffic . The situation of the first transcontinental road , running through an undeveloped country , much of which was inhabited only by wild animals and wilder men , was such that it had to apply this principle rigorously . To get any of the traffic from the Atlantic to the Pacific Coast it had to make rates which would be as attractive to the shipper as the low rates made by water . It did not have to make rates ate Battle in the West 365 as low in proportion on traffic from the Pacific Coast into the interior ; it had a monopoly of that business . It therefore made its rates from the Coast to the interior relatively high . Nor did it have to make low rates to get traffic moving from the east to the western interior . If goods for the interior came by water the shipper had to pay the ocean rate , plus the rate of the railway back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or five hundred miles of the Coast the railway made rates that were equivalent . When its trains on their way from the East dropped goods off at these points , it charged as much as if it had hauled them to the Coast and back . If its rate from New York to San Francisco was $1.00 , and its rate from San Francisco to Reno , Nev. , 50 cents , its rate from New York to Reno , Nev. , was $1.50 . The places to which rates were based on the rates to coast terminals were called " intermediate " points . When the Northern Pacific built to Tacoma , Wash. , the Great Northern to Seattle , Wash. , the Atchison , Topeka &; Santa Fe to Los Angeles , Cal. , they one after the other adopted this same method of ratemaking , and it is still followed . Originally the railway rates to the Pacific Coast from Eastern cities not on the Atlantic Ocean were more than from New York City and other Atlantic ports . But the steamship lines began " absorbing " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the Atlantic , thus making the rate by rail-and-water from these places the same as by water from New York . The railways met this competition by also making their rates from places four hundred or five hundred miles west of the Atlantic Ocean the same as from the Atlantic seaboard . The manufacturers and merchants at cities in the Middle West demanded the same rates to the Pacific Coast as were given Pittsburg , Buffalo , etc. , and the Atlantic seaboard . It was to the interest of the roads extending from the Middle West to grant their demands . When a manufacturer or jobber in Pittsburg shipped goods all-rail to the Pacific Coast , the roads west of Chicago got only part of the rate . When a competing manufacturer or jobber in Chicago shipped them , the roads west of Chicago got all of the rate . Consequently , in 1894 the rates to the Pacific Coast were 366 " blanketed " ? that is , made the same ? from all points in the United States east of the Missouri River . Corresponding changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the Middle West to points in the Western interior . The rates to these places are not directly affected by water competition , and therefore on traffic moving to them the Eastern lines commonly exact their usual local rates to the end of their rails ; and the Western roads commonly exact their usual rates from there on . The distance * to Seattle , Wash. , from St. Paul , Minn. , is 1,900 miles ; from Chicago , 2,300 miles , and from New York , 3,200 miles . But the first-class rate to Seattle , whether from St. Paul , Chicago , or New York , is $3.00 per Too pounds . The distance to Spokane , Wash. , from St. Paul is 1,500 miles ; from Chicago , 1,900 miles ; and from New York , 2,800 miles ; but the first-class rate from St. Paul to Spokane is $3.00 ; from Chicago , $3.60 ; and from New York , $4.35 . Nor do the class rates fully disclose the state of affairs . The great bulk of the traffic from the East to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are special low rates on specific commodities . Many more of these rates are made to the Coast than to the interior . This greatly increases the disproportion . Take , for example , a rather extreme instance , the item of " tin boxes and lard pails , nested . " When these articles are shipped in car-load quantities to Spokane the fourth-class rate is applied , which is $1.90 from St. Paul ; $2.10 from Chicago ; and $2.45 from New York . But from throughout the East to Seattle a uniform car-load commodity rate of 85 cents is made . Even cities east of the " intermediate points " and whose rates are not based on the Coast terminals , in many instances have to pay higher charges than cities on the Coast . These differences are due to the policy of the roads in exacting their usual local rates on goods shipped to the Western interior . Salt Lake City is 1,000 miles west of Omaha and 800 miles east of San Francisco . The firstclass through rate from throughout the East to San Francisco is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only $2.05 from Omaha . But if he buys goods in Chicago he must pay the sum of the local rates , ... Illl. l which is $2.85 ; and if he buys them in New York he must pay $3.52 . The " blanket " commodity rate from the East to San Francisco on structural iron is 8o cents . But when the shipper at Salt Lake City buys structural iron in Pittsburg , he has to pay 22i cents from Pittsburg to the Mississippi River , plus 22 cents from the Mississippi River to the Missouri River , plus 65 cents from the Missouri River to Salt Lake City , a total of $1.10 , or 30 cents more than the through rate to San Francisco . In many instances the rate from the East is higher even to Denver , Colo. , than to San Francisco , although Denver is 1,400 miles farther east . The earlier attacks on this scheme of rates were based on the ground that it violated the long-and-short-haul section of the Interstate Commerce law . But the Supreme Court of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions " that justified the making of lower rates where it was encountered . When the Interstate Commerce Commission was given express power to fix reasonable rates , the people of Spokane , Wash. , renewed the contest . They filed the first complaint under the Hepburn act . They again alleged that the rates were unduly discriminatory because higher to Spokane than to points on the Pacific Coast . But this time they also set up that the rates to Spokane were excessive because they yielded to the railways larger profits than common carriers are entitled to earn . The Commission took a great deal of evidence on each point . In its decision , which was rendered in February , 1909 , it ruled against Spokane on the first point . It said : " It can not be denied , in view of the uncontroverted facts , that water competition does exist , and that it does produce a controlling effect upon rates to the Pacific Coast from many Eastern destinations . It is beyond doubt that this competition absolutely limits those rates from New York 1 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific Coast terminals . " But it ruled in favor of Spokane on the second point . It expressly held that the net earnings of the Northern Pacific and the Great Northern were excessive , and ordered them to reduce their class rates from Chicago and St. Paul to Spokane 16 2/3  | per cent. , or to the same level as their present rates to Seattle , and to make corresponding reductions in commodity rates . It said that owing to water competition the carriers do not violate the law by maintaining higher rates to Spokane ; and that it required them to apply their existing rates to Seattle as their rates to Spokane merely because these would be reasonable rates to Spokane , " irrespective of Seattle . " The ruling that the rates to Spokane are excessive , because the net earnings of the railways have been unjustifiably large , is of the greatest interest and significance . It is without precedent in the decisions of any Federal tribunal . I shall revert later to the very important question that it raises . I am concerned at present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates . Other transcontinental roads , such as the Union Pacific , the Southern Pacific , and the Atchison , Topeka &; Santa Fe , have been earning profits comparable to those of the northern lines . Their rates to other interior communities are as high in proportion as those to Spokane . It followed that if the rotes to Spokane ought to be reduced , so ought those to the rest of the interior . Other communities were not slow to see the point . Petitions for reductions were poured upon the Commission by communities from the Canadian to the Mexican border , including Walla Walla , Wash. ; Le Grande and Pendleton , Ore. ; Lewiston , Idaho ; Reno , Nev. ; Salt Lake City and Ogden , Utah ; Phoenix , Ariz. ; and Las Vegas and Albuquerque , N. Mex . The northern lines suggested a plan of readjustment . This was to reduce class rates both from Chicago , St. Paul , and cities on the Mississippi and Missouri rivers , and from the Pacific Coast , to intermediate communities by 16 2/3 per cent. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to intermediate points 75 per cent . of the rates to the Coast , plus the local rates back . On articles produced mainly in the East the rates from the Atlantic seaboard would be the same as from Chicago . On articles produced both in the Middle West and in the East , the rates from the Atlantic seaboard to an intermediate point would be the local rail rate from the Atlantic seaboard to Chicago , plus the rate from Chicago to the intermediate community . The object of thus making the rates from the East higher in some cases than from the Middle West was to " give the Western lines an advantage by originating the traffic nearer their terminals . " This plan called forth general protests . The jobbers on the Pacific Coast objected that it would place them at a disadvantage in competing against the jobbers in the Middle West for business in intermediate communities . The present first-class rate from St. Paul to Spokane is $3.00 . A 16 2/3 per cent . reduction of this would be 50 cents . The first-class rate from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent . reduction of this would be only 22 1/2 cents . The absolute reduction from the Coast would be 27 1/2 cents less than that from the Middle West . The jobbers at Seattle and Tacoma , Wash. ; Portland , Ore. , and San Francisco and Los Angeles , Cal. , therefore filed complaints with the Commission protesting against the proposed readjustment , and alleging that the present rates from the Coast eastward are excessive both because they are higher in proportion to distance than those from the Middle West and because they yield to the railways exorbitant profits . The people of Spokane protested because although in all cases their rates from the Middle West would be lower , in some cases their rates from the Atlantic seaboard , where they buy only 10 per cent . of their goods , would be made higher than now . The manufacturers and jobbers at Chicago , St. Louis , and other Middle Western cities intervened to prevent the percentage of reduction from the Coast being made greater than from the Middle West . And , finally , the manufacturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the East intervened to argue that in no case should the rates from the Atlantic seaboard to the West be made any higher compared with those from the Middle West than they are now ! The Commission decided that it was not worth while to make two bites of a cherry , even such an extraordinarily big one . It reopened the Spokane case , and announced it would give a series of hearings at which it would investigate the entire Western rate situation ; and hearings were held during the fall of 1909 at Salt Lake City , Spokane , Seattle , Portland , San Francisco , and several other places . Never were the rates of any section sifted by a  | public body with such thoroughness , or attacked and defended with such skill , energy , and resources . In this , as in all other struggles over railway rates , the interest of the public as a whole is what ought to be considered by the Commissions and courts that are the immediate arbiters of such struggles , and by public opinion , which is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not that this or that contestant shall prevail , but that from the facts found correct principles shall be induced which shall be applied to the beneficent solution of this and other problems involving the just relations between the rates of rival producing and distributing communities , and the respective rights of the carrier and the shipper . It is plain what principles the complaining communities seek to have applied . They argue , in substance , that rates should be based on what it costs the railways to render the service of transportation . As distance is an inexact , but approximate , measure of cost of service , they ask that rates shall be made roughly in proportion to distance . The railways contend , on the other hand , that rates should generally be based , not on what it costs the railway to render the service of transportation , but on the value of its services to those to whom they are rendered . The shippers ' argument , as applied to the rates on a specific commodity , is as follows : The rate on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco , 3,200 miles , is 75 cents , or 4.7 mills per ton per mile . Now , of course , the railways make this rate to meet water competition . But it is not to be assumed that they voluntarily fix a rate that does not cover the cost of the service , including operating expenses and overhead charges . But their rate on green coffee , in car-loads , from New York to Denver , 1,900 miles , is 93 cents , or 9.4 mills per ton per mile . It must follow that they make a very excessive profit out of this rate , and that it ought to be reduced to substantially the same basis per ton per mile as that to San Francisco . The railway traffic managers reply that this reasoning is fallacious . The initial fallacy is in the assumption that the railway will not voluntarily make any rates which will not cover all operating expenses and overhead charges . They make rates every day that do not cover all these things . The production of transportation , like the manufacture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of joint cost . The meat packer pays , perhaps , $7.00 per too pounds for a steer . He makes a number of things from the carcass ? steaks , roasts , etc. ? and finally , from the residue , fertilizer . He does not sell too pounds of each for the average cost per too pounds of the steer , plus proportionate parts of the expense of operating his factory and of his overhead charges . He sells porterhouse steaks for a great deal more than this . He sells fertilizer for very much less . The manufacture of fertilizer adds something to the expenses of running his plant . If he gets for it something more than this added expense , he can say truly that he has derived a profit from it , although he may not receive for it one-tenth as much per too pounds as he paid for the steer . He does not try to base his prices on his average cost , because if he did the prices of his higher-class products would not equal , and his prices for his lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrons , and his profits would be reduced both because he accepted less for porterhouse steaks than they were worth , and because he tried to get more for fertilizer than any one would pay . His sale of fertilizer for less than his average cost does not hurt those who pay him more than his average cost for other things ; in fact , whatever he gains from making and selling it , tends to enable him to sell other things for less than he otherwise would have to charge . Now , the railway manager is in a situation precisely analogous to the packer . The transcontinental railways haul goods to and from the Western interior . They haul vast quantities of fruit , vegetables , lumber , etc. , from the Pacific Coast to the East . It does not make much difference in their total operating expenses whether they pull their cars to the Coast empty or loaded . If they can load their cars to the Coast with traffic that pays only a little more than the additional expense incurred by taking it , their net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rates that they can get to the Coast are strictly limited by the rates by water . If they are made much higher than the rates by water the Coast shipper will bring his goods in by @# boat , because the rail charge will exceed the value to him of the rail service as compared with the water service . These low rates to the Coast , therefore , can not , it is contended , be taken as the criterion of the reasonableness of rates to the interior where water competition is not met , any more fairly than the price at which the packer sells fertilizer can be taken as the criterion of the reasonableness of the price at which he sells porterhouse steaks . If these rates were made the measure of the reasonableness of the rates to the interior , the railways would have to forego the Coast traffic and get all their revenue elsewhere , which would make it necessary to charge higher rates elsewhere . Many shippers concede that the railways should not be required to make rates to the interior as low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contend that at least the rates to the interior should not be higher absolutely than to the Coast . Theoretically , the rates might be made the same either by raising those to the Coast or by reducing those to the interior . But , as a matter of fact , the charges to the Coast can not be raised without the sacrifice of a great deal of traffic . For water competition is no myth , as some writers with more imagination than knowledge have asserted . It is a stern reality . The American-Hawaiian Steamship Company now regularly takes goods from New York to Coatzacoalcas , Mexico , by boat ; thence across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec via the National Tehuantepec Railroad ; and thence by boat to destination , and lands them in San Francisco in 25 days from New York ; in Portland in 35 days , and in Seattle in 40 days . With this fast service , and with rates 20 to 6o per cent . lower than those of the railways , it has rapidly built up its business since it established this route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The present size of ocean shipments to the Coast is illustrated by the fact that last year the boats , not including tramp vessels , landed 266,000 tons of freight in California , while the Southern Pacific carried there of transcontinental traffic only 205,000 tons . It will be only a few years until the Panama Canal is done . The steamships can then give a much cheaper and faster service . How can it be said that the railways can raise their Coast rates when facing such a situation ? Suppose that they should adopt the other alternative and reduce their rates to the interior to the same level as their present rates to the Coast . This would enable the jobbers in the interior to compete more successfully against those on the Coast . The railways would not mind this , for they get all the traffic to the interior , while they have to divide that to the Coast with the boats . But the steamship companies would mind it , because their prosperity depends entirely on the growth and prosperity of the cities on the Coast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their rates as should be necessary to enable the cities of the Coast to continue to compete successfully with those in the interior . The Coast cities always have had lower rates than those in the interior , and they always will have them ; and this , regardless of what the railways have done in the past , and probably regardless of what they shall do in the future . The logical application of the distance principle would be ruinous to the very communities that are contending for it . If , on principle , rates into this territory should be based on distance , then , on the same principle , rates out of it on its products ought to be based on distance . But both the Pacific Coast and the interior West are very remote from the great markets of the East where they sell their fruit , vegetables , lumber , etc . To enable them to sell their products in these markets the railways have made much lower rates on them in proportion to distance than on similar commodities when produced farther east . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the West . As illustrating this prosperity , it may be said that the postal receipts of Spokane , the chief complainant , increased 264 per cent . from 1900 to 1908 ; its bank clearings 400 per cent. , and its population 500 per cent . On the distance principle , these low rates from the West would have to be greatly raised , to the equal detriment of the Western producer and of the Eastern consumer . It does not necessarily follow that some readjustment of rates is not feasible and desirable . The roads concede that some changes should be made . It is to the interest of the entire nation , including the Western railways , that the development of the rich natural resources of the interior  | West should be fostered in every practicable manner . The only way the railways could put and keep it on an actual parity of rates with the Pacific Coast would be to get control of the water lines . Public opinion would not stand that . The roads may also help the interior communities considerably by reducing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; provided , however , that they shall be at the same time allowed to maintain relatively high rates from the Pacific Coast eastward . If each reduction from the East and Middle West to the interior is to be accompanied not only by even greater reductions in the water rates , but also by corresponding reductions in the railway rates back from the Coast , the jobbers on the Coast will always have the same relative advantage over the jobbers in the interior that they have now . There will be no change in the relations between the rates to the contending communities , but only similar reductions to all and consequent depletions of the earnings of the railways . On the principle contended for by the complainants in these cases and upheld by the Commission in its decision in the Spokane case , however , justice would not be done by merely readjusting rates so as to alter the relative advantages and disadvantages of the various communities . For , it is asserted , and the Commission in the Spokane case held , that the net earnings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates in general ought to be reduced . This brings us to the consideration of the second problem mentioned at the beginning of this paper , viz. , whether rates may and should be reduced when and because the profits of the railways have become large . Those who hold the affirmative base their argument chiefly on legal grounds . In the view of the law railway companies are quasi-public corporations . They perform a public service ; they exercise the right of eminent domain ; and , it is said , in the language used by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1897 in the Nebraska Rate Case ( Smythe vs . Ames , 169 U. S. , 466 ) , ' What the company is entitled to earn is a fair return upon the value of that which it employs for the public convenience . " It is argued that a fair return is the legal rate of interest ; and that when a railway 's net IF VIII Ill earnings exceed this they are too great . This , of course , is just another phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railways ought to render the transportation service for cost including operating expenses and interest . The net earnings on the capital stock of the Great Northern and the Northern Pacific , which the Commission found excessive in the Spokane case , had been io to 15 per cent . per annum for six years ; and the Commission said that the capitalizations on which this was based were only slightly more than it believed to be the values of the properties . Whether public authorities constitutionally may reduce the rates of a railway on the ground that its earnings are excessive is an open question . The decision of the Supreme Court of the United States which has the most direct bearing on the matter is that in the case of Cotting vs . Godard ( 183 U. S. , 79 ) , rendered in 1901 . This was a case involving the constitutionality of an act of the Legislature of Kansas reducing the rates of the Kansas City Stockyards Company . On the rates fixed by the company it was earning 11 per cent . On the rates fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was contended that the Legislature was justified in reducing the charges of the company because its profits were excessive . But the Supreme Court unanimously held otherwise . Justice Brewer , who wrote the opinion , said : " As to parties engaged in a public service , while the power to regulate has been sustained , negatively the Court has held that the Legislature may not prescribe rates which if enforced would amount to a confiscation of property . But it has not held that the Legislature may enforce rates that stop only this side of confiscation . . . . It has declared that the present value of the property is the basis by which the test of reasonableness is to be determined , although the actual cost is to be considered , and that the value of the services rendered to each individual is also to be considered . " He quoted many decisions in which American and English courts had passed on the reasonableness of the charges of public service corporations , including railways , and , summing up , added : " The authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not an i  | authority to destroy the principles of these decisions but simply to enforce them . . . . The question is always not , What does he ( the person performing a public service ) make as the aggregate of his profits ? but , What is the value of the services which he renders to the one seeking and receiving such services ? Of course , it may sometimes be . . . that the amount of aggregate profits may be a factor in considering the question of reasonableness of the charges , but it is only one factor , and is not that which finally determines the question of reasonableness . " While this case involved the rates of a stockyards company , the railways maintain that it established a precedent for railway rate cases . They argue that so long as the rate that they charge a shipper is not unduly discriminatory or in excess of the value of the service rendered to him , he can not complain that it is unreasonable because it yields the railway a larger profit than some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railway 's profits are large . It is contended by the railways that even if the public , through commissions or legislatures , has the power to so reduce the rates of railways as to limit their net earnings to the current rate of interest , it will not be economically expedient to exercise it . What has enabled the railways in the West to struggle up since 1897 from bankruptcy to their present prosperity ? Shippers say that it has been the general prosperity of the country and the consequent growth of traffic . But in one way the railways of the country have not shared with other business concerns in the general prosperity . It has been a period of large advances in the wages of labor and in the prices of materials . The railways have had to pay their share of these higher wages and prices . But , unlike other concerns , they have not been able , in the West or elsewhere , to advance materially the prices of what they sell ? transportation . Can it be said , then , that the increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth of traffic ? This question was touched upon in an article in the North American Review for September , 1909 , by a competent and disinterested observer , W. M. Acworth , the leading authority on railway economics in England . His conclusion was that the great change in their financial situation has " arisen mainly from the stern lesson ate Battle in the West 371 of adversity taught to American railways in the year 1893 , and the way in which American railway officers took those lessons to heart . " He added : " If an outsider might criticise , I should say that I am startled at the ingratitude which the American public has displayed in return for the marvellous skill and energy with which American railway men revolutionized the operation of American railways in the years when traffic began to recover after the panic of 1893 . " Mr. Acworth implies that the main cause of the large increase in net earnings has been the reductions in operating expenses that have been effected by improvements in the railways ' plants and in the methods of operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether first paid out as dividends or not , has always been invested in improving the existing lines or in building new ones . This has been of great benefit to the public . But , say railway managers , the main incentive to improve and reduce the expenses of existing railways and to build new lines will be removed if it shall become the policy of the Government to appropriate for the benefit of those who furnish neither the money nor the brains for railway improvements and extensions all the net earnings above a certain low maximum . It is argued that so long as the rates of the railway do not discriminate or impose an undue burden on traffic it is entitled to earn at least the ordinary rate of commercial profit in the territory where it does business . It is contended that the prosperity which the West is enjoying shows that the rates of the railways as a whole lay no undue burden on its commerce . It is shown that the average annual profits of the very jobbers who most complain are , according to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per annum . It is argued that in view of these facts , there is no justification for sweeping reductions in freight rates . Railway rates in the United States have universally been based on the value of the service . The adoption and consistent application of the principles contended for by the shippers in these Western cases would work a revolution . A simple illustration will indicate what would be the effects . Coal is shipped to every city in the country from a large number of mines . Under the  | present method rates from the nearby mines are made relatively high per mile and from the more remote relatively low . This enables all the operators in a large district to sell their output in a large market at a profit , and the people at that market to buy their coal from any of these operators that they please . On mileage rates the operators of the nearest mines would get and keep a monopoly of the market until their mines approached exhaustion , while the more distant coal mines would be rendered comparatively valueless . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basing rates on distance would tend to build up petty monopolies in every community . At present rates are made much higher in proportion to the cost of transportation on valuable than on cheap commodities . On the basis of cost the rates on valuable commodities would have to be much reduced and those on cheap commodities to be much raised . Many commodities are so bulky in proportion to their value that under this plan they could not bear the rates imposed ; they would be excluded from the avenues of commerce ; their producers would be ruined ; and the public would lose whatever advantage it now derives from their use . The proposition to base the earnings of railways on the cost of furnishing transportation seems as untenable and inexpedient as the proposition to so base their rates . The builders of a new railway always hope for profits , but always take the risk of getting none . The owners of existing railways always hope that investments in improvements in their plants will reduce operating expenses more than they increase interest charges , and thereby yield a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest charges more than they reduce operating expenses , and incurring a loss .
