txt Yankees or " Usonians . " As has appeared In all the recent European comment about us. especially in Germany . we are regularly known abroad as the Yankees . This is a peculiarly uneuphonious name , so strikingly so , in fact , that it readily turns Into a term of contempt . But what can the Europeans do ? They are too logically minded to call us Americans ; the non-unitedstatesian part of America ( Including the whole of South America ) does not look so insignificant to them as It does to us . As I have already pointed out In THE TIMES . ( and my proposal was met with favorable response. ) nothing would be easier than for us to adopt , for the country , the name already Invented by the makers of the auxiliary international languages . Usona. ( short for tho United States of North America , ) and for the Inhabitants , in English , Usonlans . Surely , anything is better than Yankees , but however much we may shut our eyes to It , that name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can provide some substitute . Can any one find anything better than the Usonians ?
