Foley , Thomas Darlington , and George W. Plunkitt out of the club for non-aaymen t of dues . Judge Edward F. O'Dwyer of the City Court , President of the club , frankly said that it was detrimental to the best interests of the club , as well as to the National Administration , to have Murphy and the others continued as members , and the . t he would exert every influence to have them kept out . Before the action was taken Tiiornes F. Smith , Secretary of Tammany Hall , offered the Treasurer of the club a check for $12.3 , the amount of the back dues of Murphy and the four othere , but it was refused . Smith thereupon made the point that the same action regarding the dropping of members should apply to all others who were delinquent in their dues , and President O'Dwyer agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were probably 100 members who were in arrears and should receive the same treatment as Murphy did . " What I object to , " he continued , " the small , mean way in which this thing was done . It was done simply to humiliate Mr , Murphy . and it , le . the first Um , Since I have been a member that any special resolution a tidiP.character has been 7-cntcd . " " These men are a Cleti-iment to the club , and I think it can be safely said that they will never get back , " Tadge O'Dwyer said warmly . " Do n't worry about that , " Smith retorted . " They wo n't try to get back . The club wo n't last much longer , anyway . Why . it is losing $1,000 a month . " Muniltyltes Out ; Wileouites In . In reply to this President O'Dw'Yce said that the club had elected twenty new members at the meeting , among them being Gov . Glynn , Dudley Field Malone , Collector of the Port ; Fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brother oC the secretary to President Wilson . " Tumulty was elected as a non-resident member . He lives In New Jersey , " said Smith . The ousting of Murphy and others was not the only incident of the meeting , which was almost as disorderly as was the regular meeting some weeas ago , at which resolutions condemning Murphy 's leadership of the party in the city and State were adopted . There are twenty-one Governors of the club . Seventeen were present last night . The Murphy followers had not been notified of what was pending until the last minute . As soon as the meeting was called to order former United States Senator William A. Clark was elected Chairman . Col. Totatialle Dunlap then introduced a resolution calling for the indorsement of President Wilson 's attitude regarding canal tolls . It read : Resolved , That the National Democratic Club approves of and unequivocally Indorses tha honorable and patriotic recommendations of President Wilson to the Congress of the United States , advocating - the rental of the tons exemption clause of the Panama Canal act . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his followers strenuously objected to this resolution on the ground that it should come up only at a regular meeting of the club , when all the members could have an oportunity of voting on it . The Board of Governors had never taken such action before , he said , and he made a motion that it be referred back to the club . Smith won his point on this , the vote being 9 to S in his favor . City Magistrate Daniel F. Murphy then started more trouble by offering a resolution that the club collect funds for the erection at Albany " of a ' bronze tablet suitably inscribed , in celebration of the adoption of the proposed amendment to the primary Iaw by the Legislature on the recommendation of Gov . Glynn. when they shall have been made part of the primary law , " and that the tablet be erected " an enduring and suitable place and record the names of the Governor of the State and of the members of the Legislature voting for the amendment and those voting against the amendment . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the most amazing and surprising resolution that was ever presented at the club . He said it flavored of bribery , and he made a motion that it also be referred to a regular meeting of the club members . There was a long debate on this proposition , some of the members arguing that as the Legislature had not yet acted upon the primary law amendments it might seem as if the club was trying to influence the legislative members . Smith also moved that the words " and those voting against the amendment " be stricken out . This was done , but the motion to refer the resolution , to the club meeting was lost by one vote . It was then declared adopted . - O'Dwyer Moves to Oust the Bose . By this time the members were keyed up to a high pitch of excitement , and when Judge O'Dwyer then moved that Murphy , Gaffney , Foley , Darlington , and Plunkitt , all Tammany war horses , be excluded from all privileges of the club , and that their names be stricken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith wanted to know on what ground such a motion could be made , and Judge O'Dwyer replied that it was.done under Article IX of the club 's constitution , which provides that , if a member ' . fails to nay.his dues within twonionths after ; they fall , due , he shall ecease to ebe-.11 : , 44engber et tie dqb non by the club or the Board of Governors . Smith was on his feet shouting that the whole affair ' . was simply a proposition to humiliatte Murphy . Waving a check at Treasurer Milton I. D. Epstein , he called upon the members to witness that he stood ready to pay the delinquent dues in question . Smith next made the point of order that by reason of their failing to pay their dues they had already ceased to be members of the club and that it was therefore out of order to take any further action . In this contention Smith was backed up by John W. Keller . Stephen FarrAly . John Rlehle , and John F. O'Brien . Chairman Clark upheld the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board , which decided , 10 to 7 , to suse tain the ruling of the Chairman . Smith Asked to be Dropped , Too . Mr. Smith made the further motion that his name be Included in the list of those to be dropped , and Judge O'Dwyer quickly agreed to amend his motion to include it Mr. Smith . however , withdrew his proposition . He said , upon second thought , he preferred to let the original five names stand out , as it would more clearly show the rancor that was behind the proposition to have them expel led . When Smith again offered his **34;1088;TOOLONG check the Treasurer declined to receive it on the ground t , hat Murphy and the others had ceased to be members . Smith then sliggested that the resolution be amended to include all members who were delinquent In their dues . The amendment was accepted by Judge O'Dwyer . The Judge explained later ' hat under the rules of the club members who did not pay their dues could be reinstated within ten months after paying up . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping Murphy and the tour others out. - he said . Smith and O'Dwyer Excited . After the meeting Mr. Smith and Judge O'Dwyer met the reporters In a room downstairs and explained what had taken place . Both men were visibly excited , and at one point Smith said : - Why , one of the very men who was dropped , Mr. Plunkitt , voted for the club 's direct primary amendments . That shows that what happened upstairs was merely an attempt to humiliate Mr. Murphy . " " Well , that will count so much in his favor when the proposition comes up to reinstate them , ' retorted Judge O'Dwyer . Judge O'Dwyer was asked what other members were in arrears for their dues , but he said he did n't know . He said he was sure that Richard Cneiker was paid up .

He continued to make it his favorite haunt thereafter until he resigned as leader of Tammany Hall . When Charles F.
