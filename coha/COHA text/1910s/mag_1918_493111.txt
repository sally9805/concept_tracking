The General Election in England By an English Liberal THE General Election finds English politics in a state of great confusion . The present Parliament is admittedly worn out ; it has long since ceased to be a faithful reflection of the electorate or to exercise any real influence on the government . There is an unanswerable case for an early election that would give a just representation of the country 's mind under the new reform act , which has given the franchise to many millions of new voters , including women and the army . One may make too much of the point that the country and the government should not be plunged into the dust and turmoil of an election campaign at the very time when the questions of the world settlement demand the , closest attention , but it is of extreme importance nevertheless that public opinion should be directed to these issues lest they be left to the arbitrary settlement of diplomats and politicians , Many of whom belong to the old school and have little sympathy with the new . Now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generating heat with great rapiditY , will distract the public mind from all these questions . It is not the principles of peace of which men are talking , but of M. P. 's and personalities . That is the first reason for deprecating an election now . Unhappily , the result of the election can not in aflY event be a fair reflection of the people 's will . to begin with , the new register of voters is hopelessly defective . Tens of thousands of lawful Voters do not figure on the lists . The Local Government Board , which ought to have ordered that the lists should be made up by a house-to-house canvass , left the method of compilation at the op- t , i , " of the Registration officers . These in turn , in the majority of cases , left the householders to fill ill and return a highly complicated schedule which Ia rge numbers of them did not understand . The ' tlevitable result followed . Thousands never returned their forms at all ; thousands filled up the particulars wrongly . The electorate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voting lists until the register is again made up . It is true that the election could not be postponed untilthe making of a new register , but if it could have been put off until after the peace settlement and the return of the main portion of the armies , a v crY serious evil would have been mitigated . Dur- ing the discussion of the franchise bill much was made of the soldiers ' and sailors ' vote . Whoeverelse had or had not a vote , the " boys " were to have a full voice in reconstructing the new world for which they had been fighting . But now it is estimated that we shall be lucky if fifty per cent of them are able to record their votes and some authorities put the proportion very much lower . From every constituency comes the same story of inaccurate and insufficient addresses by which to reach the men on active service , and for days the party officials have been searching the army books , endeavoring in hot haste to discover the correct address and thereafter trusting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the proxy vote , which was to solve the problem of the soldiers ' vote in distant lands , it is agreed that little use is being made of it at all . The complaint against Mr. Lloyd George is that he should be forcing an election now instead of waiting until after the Peace Conference . Then would have been the time for an election on the principles of reconstruction . He says that he must have a mandate to go to the Peace Conference as the representative of the nation to negotiate a " just peace . " His statements of the conditions on which this peace is to be made are unimpeachable . " No settlement that contravenes the principles of eternal justice will be a permanent one . " " We shall go to the Peace Conference to guarantee that the League of Nations is a reality . " But the fact is that Mr. Lloyd George and his government already have all the mandate that they can possibly desire for the Peace Conference . They have won the war ; it is their right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the peace settlement and up to the beginning of the work of reconstruction Mr. Lloyd George stands unchallenged . Why , then , does he insist on an election ? Mr. Lloyd George is looking far beyond the Peace Conference . He is using the Conference and the peace settlement as a means by which to obtain a further spell of office ? five years , if he can last so long ? in which to carry out a general programme under his compact with Mr. Bonar Law and the Unionist party . This is one of the reasons which is alienating from him much Liberal support that has hitherto been his . He is imitating the tactics of Mr. Joseph Chamberlain who , at the " Khaki " Election of 1900 , obtained a mandate to wind up the Boer War and used it until the end of 19os to carry out a purely Tory programme . Mr. Lloyd George also has a programme , and it would not be fair to say that he has not given the country a broad outline of what he intends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his programme is wholly admirable . We are to have great social reforms , housing --  " habitations lit for the heroes who have won the war " ? increased production , a reduction of the hours of labor , a minimum wage , improved transportation and the like . These are excellent ideas , if vaguely phrased . But in Mr. George 's letter to the Unionist party , and it is this which forms the basis of the new Coalition bargain , there are other proposals which are by no means vague and are concessions to the Unionists for which they have given no return . Mr. George agrees that preferences should be given within the Empire on present and future duties , with the reservation that there shall be no taxes on food . But everyone knows , as Mr. Joseph Chamberlain always insisted , that without taxes on food there can be no genuine preference and that the Unionist party is merely accepting Mr. George 's concession as an instalment of the full Protectionist policy which is its own . One Unionist member has already announced that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their different claims to state protection . Besides , the Liberal who believes in freedom of exchange as one of the bulwarks of world peace , asks whether the new preferential system is to include the CrOwn colonies and dependencies , and whether the Coalition is arriving at the " self-sufficing " and closed Empire which some imperialists demand . Again , Mr. George declares for the principle of Home Rule , with the reservation that Ulster must not be coerced , but he shelves Home Rule for the present , though the Home Rule act is on the statute book . What is perhaps most ominous of all , the Coalition manifesto , signed by Mr. George and Mr. Law , mentions almost as an aside that the House of Lords is now to be reformed ? of course , on a democratic basis . The House of Lords reformed by a government of which the united . Tory party will inevitably be the mainstay Picture the state of mind of the good Liberal who sees Free Trade abandoned , Ireland coerced , and the Parliament act , by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought ) drawn finally , overthrown in order that a conservative and a stronger Second Chamber i-nay be set up against the House of Commons . These fears are fairly justified , for the breach in the Liberal party and the abstention of Labor mean that the Tory party will be the mainspring of the Coalition . Mr. George 's contribution is to be a generous policy of social reform , if he can impose it on his Tory friends . It is , however , Mr. George 's handling of the election in the constituencies which is at the moment rousing resentment . His speeches , indeed , are astonishing , He tells us blandly that party politicsin the days of peace did not , as we thought , turn on questions of high principle ; they were , it seems merely a way of infusing life and spirit into the questions of the day . Opposition , which we had thought so necessary to democratic government , , organized fault-finding . " A legitimate , if mis ' taken , attempt to overthrow his government this spring is stigmatized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so complete a volte-face in the greatest and most successful of our party politicians ? Liberals ask resentfully whether Mr. Lloyd George was shl ? cere in the days of party politics of which he now speaks so cynically , and does he think that they also were playing a mere game when they declared that they were fighting for principles and ideals . But after all . speeches do not kill . Mr. Georger however , does not stop at speeches . Power and success ? and all men admit his success as a War Minister and are profoundly grateful to him for it ? have made him intolerant of opposition . He has declared war on Liberals who decline to give a pledge to support the Coalition government , not for the conclusion of the war , not for the making of peace , but for all its programme , for so long as it remains in office . An astonishing result has followed . Coalition candidates , sanctioned and approved by Mr. LloYd George and his Whips , are being put up against lifelong Liberals . In London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against twelve Liberals . In Lancashire , Coalition candidates are being set up against the local Liberal in constan ? encies'which have had an unbroken Liberal record for a generation . It is inevitable that there should be bitter resentment against a policy which threat " , ens the Liberal party with disaster , and which sub " ordinates the autonomy of the constituency to the manoeuvres or dictation of the Whips ' offices London . Mr. Lloyd George has lost ground heal ily among Liberals since these manoeuvres cone , to the light of day . This is so much the accepted view that at the time of writing it is rumored that the Coalition docket of approval will be withdrOci throughout the country . The election makes no one happy but the Tories ' Mr. George , if he wins the victory , will have ti ? genuine Coalition behind him . Labor has repudi " ated it ; most of the Liberal party is now hostile to him . Liberals , on the other hand , lack a leadef " There is great dissatisfaction with Mr. Asquith With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes inertia . He is a man of words , not ? f action , too often of bold words which go unfulfilled , but so far in this crisis he has not even found h ? 1 words to give to his expectant following . He has still his chance during the next few weeks , but there are many Liberals who regard it as his last . More and more do real Liberals look towards the Labor party , which at all events has a policy and a mind of its own . Labor has cut itself free from the Coalition and most of its Ministers are coming out of office , slowly and hesitatingly indeed , but they are corning . Those who stay , as Mr. Barnes and Mr. Roberts apparently will stay , will represent no one but themselves , and for that reason they are likely to find that the Coalition has little use for them . But the Tories are in good fettle . If they win the election , the new government will be predominantly Tory . They will set their feet on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They will set up a Second Chamber after their own hearts to check the popular tide which Will shortly be in motion . This is their chance to regain all that they have lost since 1906 , and they will not neglect it , if it comes their way . "
