about to tell I have never told before . The events in it took place when I was a child of fifteen , an oldish child of fifteen . I had a taste for books and dreams , and a kind of adoring love of older people ; a predilection , too , for romance and wonderment . There were many things I meant to do some day . Among my lesser resolves was one that I had held for a good many years : I mean the resolve some day to be a passenger in the absurd old-fashioned bus that had made its daily journey , ever since I could remember , from my home town to a small town quite off the railroad , and some twelve milesaway , the county-seat of that county in which my home was situated . The bus was an extraordinary-looking vehicle . It had the air of a huge beetle . It creaked and rattled when it was in action . It had enormous dipping springs . It lunged and rolled a bit from side to side as it went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low iron railing around it , convenient for the lashing of ropes to hold the packages of all kinds and sizes with which it usually went laden . There was a door at the back and there were two steps by which to enter . It had the air of being a distinguished character , even among the antiquated and entirely individual types of vehicle still common then in the little old-fashioned town . This air was , no doubt , due chiefly , o the large oval pictures painted , not without some skill , on its sides . One of these depicted the rescue of Daniel Boone by Kenton , who with the butt of a large musket was perpetually about to brain a murderous Indian ; the other dealt with Smith 's unchanging obligation to Pocahontas . I hardly think Keats had more lasting enjoyment of his Grecian urn with brede of marble men and maidens overwrought ' than I of those pictures , where , not less than in the more classic example , I saw perpetually preserved what I took to be the most thrilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyalty and undying affection . But , interesting as all this was , it was by no means the heart of that strange fascination with which , for so many years , I contemplated the old beetling vehicle . Its fascination lay for me in its daily journey to parts beyond the bounds of my narrow horizon . It plied faithfully every week-day of the year , an envoy extraordinary , ambassador plenipotentiary , between another world and mine . Some day I should see that world and know it . It must not be supposed , however , that I had in mind only the town to which the bus journeyed , the mere inconsiderable county seat . Children 's imaginations , especially when the child is just emerging into all the glorious possibilities of womanhood , deal not in towns but in worlds . The world outside my own narrow bounds of life , that was what I meant to see and experience . I can think of only one thing , besides the old bus , which roused my fancy to an equal degree , namely the herds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once and sometimes twice a week , to the stockyards which lay somewhere on the outskirts of my home town . If I close my eyes , I canstill hear on hot afternoons the dark herds trampling past , a mass of broad backs and spreading horns and wide foreheads , ? and dull or occasionally frightened eyes , ? and the hurrying hoofs , scuffling the dust . I had never seen the stockyards . I was never informed very particularly about them , and by some instinct , I suppose , I never inquired too carefully . But I knew this for another world also , and dread as it was , it fascinated me . I believe the hurrying herds stood to me for a kind of world of fearful reality that I meant some day to look into , and the old picture-painted bus for a world of romance , yonder , yonder over the dip of the horizon , which not less , some day , I was determined to know . Just how I came to take my resolve , and the events which precipitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The story begins just where I stood that hot day in June waiting for the bus by the dusty mullens beside the pike . I had walked a good mile outside the town so that none of the townspeople would see the beginning of my adventure . The bus was late , I think , even allowing for my anxiety . It came in sight at last , at a slow beetling pace . I held up a slim finger . But not until he was alongside did the driver begin to draw in the long reins . I ran after the bus a few paces , opened the door , climbed the high steps with a beating heart , and got in . The driver peeked through the little peek-hole in the roof to make sure I was safe ; then he called to his horses , and the vehicle lunged ahead . The only other passengers were an old man , unknown to me , who carried a basket of eggs , and an old woman who lived somewhere outside the town and whom I recognized as her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deleted material in jest or earnest . But as I look back on it now it seems to me curiously fitting that the little town should have had so scant dependence on timepieces , for it lay away from all the world , and there was so little to occupy the attention that the houses , the dusty pike , with its slowly lengthening and slowly shortening shadows , the fields beyond , with their great sycamores and maples , and the sky so little interrupted from edge to edge , must each , indeed , have been to those who had so long observed them , a sundial to make clocks seem mere bustling contrivances . A big fly sailed in one of the bus windows and round and round , droning , and then out ; and went with every effect of careful choice and deliberation to settle on the nose of the old dog that lay , alternately napping and snapping , four feet in the sun . I can give you no idea of the keen enjoyment with which I noted all these details . I take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lived in Paris , among its thrilling boulevards and monuments , and had seen some stagey Swiss villages and dramatic little French towns , this little cluster of houses known as Latonia , on a dusty pike in Kentucky , only a few miles from my own home , ? this village which never a tourist would have gone to see , ? was to me in that droning , incredibly quiet afternoon a very piece of romance ; the air itself ? I beg you to have patience with me , for really , I tell you only the truth ? the very air itself being ' ambient ' for me ; the green fields amburbiar ; the white clouds , so nearly at rest in the blue sky , ' huge symbols of a high romance ' ; the silver poplars and elms not less than immemorial ' : and the old hotel a thing made of dreams , haunted with green and shaded memories of beforethe-war days , across whose verandah might have stepped at any moment , before my unastonished eyes , the actors in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eye found some dusty marigolds , their blooms leaning through a low paling fence of one of the houses . My eye must have passed over many a marigold before that ; I probably never saw one until then . I remember noting their singularity and softness of color , so individual and particular compared with the more customary reds and yellows of commoner flowers , so far more memorable and desirable and foreign ; a part they seemed , too , of the quietness and strangeness and romance in the midst of which I found myself . The bus driver was making ready to leave . The lame war veteran , ? for I still take him to have been such , ? having got so far as the gate of the Latonia Hotel , was met by a long , lazy-legged darkey coming clown the walk , carrying two traveling satchels . Noticeably new-looking they were , and handsome , for that part of the world . He had one under his arm , the other dangling from the same hand , which left his other hand free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chewing lazily . The veteran held the gate open , the weight of his body leaning against it . Going away , are they ? ' Yassult ' There emerged from the hotel at this moment a man and a woman . The darkey crossed the road and put the two satchels in the bus ? and stood with his hand on the handle of the bus door , holding it wide open , waiting . I watched the two strangers as they approached . When they reached the bus the man assisted the woman , in a somewhat formal yet indifferent way . deleted material in itself a kind of romance . She gave one the impression of being a woman unique ; something rare and choice , not to be found again or elsewhere . Once she turned her head and met my full gaze . I was embarrassed , but I need not have been . She set the matter right by addressing me with a gentle courtesy . ' Do you live out here ? ' I shook my head . I meant to reply more fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man spoke . ' Never heard of Thomas Felton , I suppose ; did you ? Used to live once in Owen County not far from here . ' I shook my head again and formed the word ' No . ' The woman gave him a gentle glance ; nothing reproving , but he took it in the manner of reproof . ' Well , I did not know but she might have , ' he explained . Then he settled back a little . ' Maybe some one else will get in later who does know . I thought them confoundedly stupid at the hotel . Did n't seem anxious to give any information either . Nobody knows anything in a place like that . ' There was silence again . The fields at one side of the road climbed now , here and there . Low pastures rose to be foothills . Around one of these hills a rocky road appeared sloping down to the pike . Up the road , at a little distance , was a rustic archway like an entrance to a private property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure strange to me , in the garb of some monastic order . The woman did not notice him . Her glance was far off at the horizon at the other side . The man did . He regarded the stranger with a stolid bold curiosity . Then some idea of his own occurred to him , suddenly . As the bus stopped to take on this new passenger , the heavy man rose , to take advantage of its steadiness , no doubt , and stoop-ing so as not to knock his derby against the ceiling of the vehicle , tapped imperatively on the lid of the little peep-hole , and when it was raised , spoke to the driver . This road leading up at the side here does n't happen to be the Chorley road , does it , that leads into Felton 's woods ? They said there was a road at the foot of a hill that led into some timber lands belonging to a man named Felton . ' The driver did not understand . The question had to be repeated . While the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely sure he was of that order ? opened the door of the bus . The woman turned her head now . I saw her orange-colored eyes grow wide and large as they noted him . With habitually bent head and regarding none of us , he entered . As he seated himself in the corner he looked up , however , and his eyes met hers . I saw him start really violently . His color , which was a dark olive , with a too bright crimson under it at the cheek-bones , became suddenly ashy . There was just that one look between them . The next instant she had turned to the other , returning from his questions with the driver . He had not seen the look that I had noted . The Franciscan now drew his eyes away from the woman 's face , fumbled in the skirt of his habit , and brought out a prayer-book which he opened with fingers that shook . The heavy man seated himself , exactly opposite the woman , and beside me and within touch of the Franciscan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that that might be Chorley 's road . They said it ran up a slope . It was n't , though . I thought I 'd like to get a sight of the timber . We may try to make him throw that in , in payment . ' He glanced around at the Franciscan , whose eyes were now entirely on his hook , took him in , as it were , then let his glance glide off out one of the windows . After a sufficient time , a kind of courteous pause , he leaned forward a little , raised his derby the least bit , and said , ' Excuse me , but I suppose you live here ? ' The Franciscan looked up , but answered nothing . The color came surging back suddenly into his face , which was haggard . There was a noncommittal look in his eyes , as though his lips were to say , ' I beg your pardon . ' ' I supposed you lived here , ' the other said , ' and I thought you might just happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Owen County . We are on here from New York . We are strangers and we know nothing of this country . You do n't happen to know ' The Franciscan gave a gentle smile , raised one slim hand , which yet trembled visibly , ? a fine deprecating gesture . ' Pardon , m ' sieu ! ' ' Oh , I see . ' The other touched his hat with a little motion of withdrawal and clumsy apology . ' I see . I did n't know you were French . I do n't speak French myself . Wish I did ! Excuse me . Excuse me . ' Here was an occasion ! The adventure was turning squarely toward me . I knew French ; I was proud of it and eager to offer my services . I could perfectly well act as translator , interpreter for these two . Moreover , it would give me that greatly to be desired thing , the attention of this beautiful woman . Yet I did not dare all this at once . I would wait a moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fifteen , however oldish , is shy . Would it be proper for me to say , ' Excuse me , but ' As I was thinking of it with a kind of tumult of pride and shyness , the man turned to the woman . Look here , Louise ; that 's a fact ! You speak French ! Ask him if he knows Thomas Felton 's property . Tell him it 's Felton who lived over in Owen County and used to be a wealthy man . ' She turned her clear eyes to the Franciscan and spoke in a pure Parisian French . This man , my husband , wishes me to ask if you know a Thomas Felton who has property out here in this direction . ' In the same tone exactly , she added , ' Do not let him suspect that you know me . ' ' Let him think ' ? the reply came in pure French also ? ' that I speak no English . In this way you and I can converse together . ' Her wonderful orange-colored eyes quivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franciscan and met the waiting eyes of her husband . She spoke with perfect composure , however . ' He says he believes there was such a man hereabouts some years ago . ' Her husband turned quickly as though he himself would further address the Franciscan ; then , recollecting that he knew no French , he appealed to her again . ' Now Louise , look here . Try to get it straight . As I told you , there are two men of that name , a nephew and an uncle . It 's the uncle I want to get hold of . He is the man who owns the property we want . Ask this man how old this Felton is , this man he knows ; I can tell by that . ' She turned again to the Franciscan , and spoke again in French . Indeed they spoke nothing else but that sweet and flowing language , a knowledge of which , put me , without my will , in league with them . ' How do you happen to be here ? ' she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , ' he said . ' That is , they simply allow me to live with them , chiefly on account of my name , I think ; that , and , I think , as an act of mercy . As a kind of lay brother ? it is simple . But , this man ? he is your husband ? ' Yes , I have been married to him eight months . ' In God 's name ! ' he said , but in a perfectly even conversational tone . ' And you have suffered . Of course you have suffered . ' They used throughout their conversation , as I have not indicated here , because it sounds forced in English , the familiar and gentle tutoiement , the theeand-thouing of the French . The husband , understanding nothing of what they said , was watching the two with interest ; his small eyes were eager in his heavy face ; he was waiting for his answer . Do not let us talk too long , ' the Franciscan said , and turned with a faintly courteous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conversation . ' Ask me some more questions , ' he said to the woman ; get him to ask some more questions , I mean . In that way we shall have a little time to talk together . ' She addressed her husband . He is not quite sure . He thinks , however , the man he has in mind has a gray beard . ' Her husband drew his large flat fingers down his heavy chin twice , as though stroking an imaginary beard of his own , thoughtfully ; his eyes narrowed even more , very speculatively . I see , I see ! Well now , like as not it 's the same one . ' Then he put his hands on his knees and leaned forward as though really addressing himself to the business . ' Look here , Louise , you ask him if this man he knows ever had anything to do with a railway ? a railway out West and coal lands out there . ' You must give me time . Let me see ! How does one say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it once was . I shall have to get at it in a roundabout way . Have patience . ' Take your time , ' he said , leaning back , ' only get at it if you can . It ' s important . ' She turned now to the Franciscan . But it was he rather who addressed her . But what are you going to do about this horrible marriage ? ' ' Nothing , nothing at all . ' But , good God , it is desecration . It is like defiling the bread and wine of communion . Does this man kiss you ? ' He owns the better part of two railroads , ' she said , with a kind of pitiful look in her eyes . ' He is here now to push to the wall ? if he can ? a man already overtaken by mischance and misfortune . ' Why do you evade ? ' said the other . He does of course touch you , he owns you , along with the better part of two railroads . He fondles you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . Not you ; not you . ' ' You forget , ' she said , and still her voice kept the strangely even tone . My sister was ill , dying , I thought . I could give her everything by this means . I did give her everything . She is better now , as well as she will ever be . She could not bear poverty ; it was killing her . She never could . She is better . ' But at what horrible , what hellish cost ! ' he replied . ' She was selfish always and complaining ; one of the useless ones ; and moreover , answer me , does one buy a cracked pitcher , doomed to be broken at any rate , with the most exquisite pearl in the world , priceless above ten sultans ' ransoms ? Were it not so horrible it would be ridiculous . Does one , I ask you , do a thing like that ? ' She turned to her husband . He says he believes the man you deleted material Two years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ; and I think those eight months have been twice eight years . And two years , two years together , you and I ! But oh , if it had been one year only ; if we had had but one year together . Only one year ! ' There was a kind of pleading in her %Mee . Only one year ! It is as though one were to say " only springtime , " ? " only love , " ? " only heaven , " ? " only God ! " ' What does he say ? ' said her husband . Perhaps he was curious at the tone of her voice ; or merely impatient at the length of their conversation . Tell him anything , ' said the other . ' We must converse at any cost . Tell him anything you like ; only do not cease to speak to me . ' She turned to her husband . He is quite interesting . He thinks he used to know this man when he was a child ; that his father had some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let me question him a little more . I will tell you by and by . We must not seem to be too curious Do not interrupt me ; just let me lead him on . It may take a few moments . ' The other began now , without waiting for her to take up the conversation . But I tell you , you do not see the thing as it is . It would have been a criminal thing for a man doomed as I was , to link his life with a woman like you , frail , exquisite , young , beautiful , the very rose of the world . Is it permissible for a man to drag a woman with bins to the scaffold , even for love ? I leave it to any man . ' ' Yes , to any man , ' ? her reply was quick on his , ? but you dare not leave it to a woman . Any man would tell you it is not permissible that one about to die should lay his hand in that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , that if the woman is his wife , ? if that tradition has bound them , ? then it is his right and her duty that they should share fatality , even though they have not the high calling of love . If this man who is my husband were stricken , you , even you , would expect me ' The sentence broke and she left it as though there could be no need of making the truth plainer . Instead , she folded her hands tensely . But , oh , let us not argue . We have squandered God 's treasure , you and I. We have squandered it for the sake of convention , for old precedents , for men 's opinions ; just as this man , my husband , buys railway shares and mining properties at the fearful price of his honor , his human kindness , his soul . You despise him and shrink from him . Truly , I can not , except when he lays his hand upon me ; for we are no better than he . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spendthrifts , the three of us , here in this little space . But oh , what new folly ! Only think of our spending these precious , precious moments in argument . Shall we never have done being wasteful ! ' He fell in with her thought immediately . You love me still , then . ' Yes , always . ' Yet I have not the right , even now , to so much as touch your hand . ' No ; yet my hand lies in yours by the hour . These are things one can not keep from God . ' Do you know ' ? his voice was even ? ' I can not help wondering if the little girl over there in the corner just might possibly understand . ' No ; I think not , ' she said gently ; besides , if she did , it would not matter . ' No , perhaps not . I think she would say nothing I notice that her eyes are shaped somewhat like yours . Some day some man will love her also . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selves I would talk . If there is a heaven , there , there , you shall some day possess me ! ' Her husband broke in now , ? ' Are you finding out anything ? ' Yes , quite a little ! ' She smiled palely , then turned back to the other . How can you lie to him like that ! ' he said . And I also . ' We waste time , ' she urged . ' A carriage meets us at the next town . From there he and I are to drive over to the adjoining county . You and I have only a few moments more left at the most in this world together . ' ' Yes . ' His fingers interlaced tightly , resting in his lap . ' Let us not argue any more . You remember the night by the river , 0 my beloved ? ' As though it were the only night in the world . ' I remember that at first I dared not even be near you ; I sat on the bank a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by and by the moon came up and all around us was stillness and beauty ; the sheep slept in the pasture ; the hills were all cool with the light of the moon ; I have not forgot ; I can never forget ? I dared just to lay the tips of my fingers on the hem of your gown . You did not notice that . It was as though I had dared lay my hand on the garment of God , but sweeter , sweeter even than that . ' Oh yes , I saw . I saw and felt . And it was exactly as though by that token God had chosen me among women , as he chose the Virgin ; only , he chose me there in the moonlight , not for glory and suffering as he chose her , but just for love . He chose and called me for that . I was to love you ; was chosen by that touch to love you ; only you , among a thousand ; only you in all the world of many men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some little feathered angel of annunciation , broke into song in the trees near by . ' ' Yes ; and to me it was as though white fire were all about you ? as about some altar ; and I was afraid to touch you . I dared not . You were too beautiful , too glorious . The night was too still , too holy . And then , at last , I reached out my hand and dared , as though one were to try a miracle . I laid it on yours . And still I lived . And then , the whole scenery of earth and heaven shifted , after that , ? as you know . You leaned and kissed me . Everything was changed forever . ' ' Yes ; I know . After that there was nothing but the night and the silence , and thou and I. Even the nightingale did not sing . ' Yes . ' And since that night there has been no one else in the world but only thou and I. Other people , do they not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconsiderable leaves of a forest that shall fade and fall and be renewed ? but only leaves and shadows ? ' Only thou and I , ' he assented , ' in the wide forest , in the woods of the world . And soon , soon , soon , I shall walk the woods no more . ' Since you must go , do not be discomfited , ' she replied ; ' nor trouble at all this . If as a kind of lasting torment , to match my own , you were permitted , after death , to be near , to see this man kiss and possess me , you have but to remember the night by the river in the moonlight . You are but to remember that this is the only night in the world ; that there are no others ; that the rest are dreams ; that no lips but yours have ever really touched mine . ' Her voice was beautiful , rich ; a kind of farewell in itself . You must promise me this . ' Her husband leaned forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ca n't you find out , Louise , what I want you to ? The thing I want to know is whether he still has an interest in the coal lands . If he has it will be worth a good many thousands . Now do your best . Try . ' But you must have patience , ' she said , ' I am trying to find out something . ' I can not quite get it out of my head , ' said the other , ' that we deserve to be damned for this . Does not your conscience misgive you ? ' No ; rather my honor . I have a hatred of deception . It is the only time in my life that I have deceived . And you ? ' I might do penance . ' He smiled , I thought . He drew the cord of his habit through his slim transparent fingers until one of the knots rested in his palms . ' You could not really mean anything so horrible ! And your body , so slim , so beautiful , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was low , rang also , now , ? quivered almost . You forget that the stripes might be sweet , my well-beloved , ' ? I could see that his lips trembled , ? something still suffered for your sake . ' She put her hand to her brow , a little lovely gesture , as though all this troubled her , perhaps dazed her ; or perhaps it was some old recollection in his voice . ' How absurd we are ! We shall be parting soon . ' Yes , ' he said , ' for always . What can I say to you that you will remember ? ' Only say that you can never forget the night by the river . ' I can never forget it . ' Something in his words fell final , like a fate . She turned now to her husband . The stage was already slowing up . Is this the county seat ? I have found out quite a great deal . I will tell you more about the coal lands as we drive . He is an interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , my attention became aware of a familiar sound , the thudding hundred-hoofed sound of an approachingherd ; I had been so absorbed in the strange world of the other happening that I had not known of their approach . Almost suddenly they were about us , black and brown backs , spreading horns , broad wet noses , massive foreheads . The driver looked down through the little hole reassuringly . Just wait till they get past . They ' re on their way to the stockyards ! ' We waited , the four of us , huddled together , with a strange kind of intimacy , it seemed , in the bus , while the trampling mass of driven dumb creatures surged and swayed around us , and finally struggled painfully by , each crowding the other , on their way to death . The woman watched them with eyes in which there met fear and pity . With the last of the herd past , the driver was already opening the stage door . The woman 's husband rose , stooping . If you 'll allow me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the satchels and got out of the bus , heavily . He turned to assist the woman . She did not give him her hand at once . The Franciscan drew back a little to let her pass . She paused the fraction of a moment and gave her hand to him . Good-bye . ' When she was beside the large man on the road , he also offered his hand to the Franciscan . Thank you ; thank you very much indeed . ' He turned . Guess that 's our surrey over there , Louise . ' The darkey driver of the surrey hurried toward him . ' Yes ; take these . ' The woman followed hint . She did not look back . He assisted her into the surrey and followed , himself , his weight bending it heavily to one side as he entered . I saw them drive away , along a broad cross-road into the lovely rolling country , her brown veil floating a little , unknown to her , but like a living thing , with a little wild waving of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in another direction . The curve of it soon hid him . I did not see him again . I remained in the bus . We were to stay only a little while at the county seat , for we were already late . New horses were put to the pole , and within twenty minutes we were driving over the same road by which we had come . An old gentleman who , I think , was a lawyer returning from county court , was the only other occupant and he was soon dozing . It was a strange ride back . When we came to Latonia the light was so altered as to make a new and lovely adventure of it . The sun was not yet set , but the sunlight had withdrawn to the tops of the tall trees . Below , the hotel lawn was cool , almost twilit , mysterious in shadows . It was there only a little while ago that I had first seen these two coming down the path to enter the bus . The last few hours had changed life for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , I know now that the two worlds of reality and of romance ? before that distinct and separate in my mind and all untried ? were forever mingled with each other now , for me , and were one with my own life . I shall never henceforth be able to see a herd of cattle on a dusty road without seeing those two in their last meeting , nor shall I ever see any who remind me of him or her without a sense of love and death and the inevitable . This is a true story . I have never told it before . I have kept it locked away as something too cherished , too intimate to share with any one . There always seemed to me a finality about it beyond any story I could ever read . Yet I am telling it now , partly from a sense of honor , partly from a hidden hope ; because it was not , after all , finished that day . She may still be living . This may chance to meet her eye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark-eyed child who rode with them that clay came in time , by that strange chance , so much more strange in life than in any story , to meet just what she had met : to meet Love , the glorious and radiant presence , only to find that there walked beside Love , ? road-companions of the way , ? Poverty , and one whose face had all the likeness of Death . And I would have her know that , because of that day , and because of the memory of her in my heart , so long cherished , I , at the chosen moment , laid my hand in that of the shining Presence , ? despite those other presences , ? to go with it , in what paths soever it might lead me . It is so , I take it , life deals with us more largely than we know . Fools in our folly ; spendthrifts though we may be , throwing priceless wisdom away to the winds , as these two had done ; wasting our wealth and our substance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ; squandering gold worth the ransom of all the kings of the earth , and this for some trifling thing , some inconsiderable bauble ; yet God , unknown to us , does most usually , no doubt , save from our wrecked fortunes and our lost argosies something ? something precious still , and above price ? with which , at a future day , with merciful largesse of wisdom and of love , some other soul may yet be blest and may yet be enriched , as it were by all the treasure of the earth .
