txt One man lost his life and half a dozen others were overcome by smoke early last night in a fire that seriously damaged the National Guard Arsenal at Thirty-fifth Street and Seventh Avenue and destroyed munitions and military supplies to the value of many thousands of dollars . As one alarm after another was turned in the police from five precincts were hurried to the scene . To the thousands who gathered in the streets the fire was pregnant with spectacular possibilities . They did not know that a moment after its discovery the magazine , in which all the ammunition was stored , had been flooded , rendering its contents harmless . They only knew that in the beginning a series of small explosions , like the rattle of a rapid-firer , had been heard , while the great volumes of black and yellow smoke that poured from every aperture made reasonable the belief that everything within must be destroyed . It was a few minutes before 6 o'clock when John Cummings . a private in the Sixty-ninth Regiment , assigned as caretaker of the arsenal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office on the second floor . He dropped his mop and gave the alarm . He saw smoke pouring from one of a row of rooms along the south side of the building . The rattle of fifty or more cartridges exploding from the heat at that moment made him turn and run for the magazine . Charles Lenz , the engineer , was in the room where he repaired rifles . He also hurried to the magazine . flung open the iron door and turned on the emergency water valve . Then he slammed the door , leaving the water to oo its work . Showed Their Training . The first cry of fire found twenty-five of the staff of thirty-eight men and women regularly employed at the Ar senal . The young women  --  stenographers , clerks , and a switchboard operator  --  reflected their military training by seizing what correspondence and records lay on the desks . Major W. A. Niver telephoned the alarm . By the time he had made a hurriLa survey of the office floor and had run down the stairs the first engines were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in charge of the Arsenal in the absence in Albany of Atli 1 .

Austin , and when he ran downstairs calling his name he found him in charge of a bucket brigade that was throwing water into the blazing MOM . Private Andrew Moran and Tom , a chauffeur 1n the employ of the State , were in the yard in front of the building . Moran is chauffeur to Colonel Bostwick , and is driver of one of the motor trucks used in distributing supplies to the various armories . There were nine trucks designed for . army work in the big room that occupies most of the first-floor area . Moran and both dashed in to salvage What trucks they could . Moran cranked one big car and ran it into the street . He heard at the motor ahead , and supposed that he would follow him out . Moran returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the excitement he lost track of his co-worker , and it was not till a half hour later that he began to grow uneasy about him . He had not seen him , and expressed the fear that he might not have got out , 4it could find no one to share his fear . An hour later Peter Klippel of Fire Patrol 3 stumbled upon the senseless . He was wedged ' between the wheels of a truck and some barrels . Groping in the smoke , Klippel picked him up and carried him to the street , where other firemen assisted in carrying the ' unconscious man across the street . A tarpaulin was stretched in front of a saloon window ; on it the man wad laid . A pulmotor was brought from an ambulance , but the tube proved too short and precious time was lost trying to adlust it before another one was brought . Every means of resuscitation was tried . but it was soon evident that could not be saved .

Deputy Chief Martin , the first to arrive on the scene , sent in a second and then a third alarm . Within a few minutes engines , water towers , and apparatus of every sort were speeding through the crowded streets . Seventh Avenue in the neighborhood of the Arsenal is still torn up for subway construction , and it was with great difficulty that the heavy engines were brought into action . The crowd at first gathered close , but the reserves drove them back half way to Sixth and Eighth Avenues , and . a block and a half on either side the building on Seventh Avenue . At no time was there any flame visible from the outside , but the structure was shrouded in an envelope of dense , pungent smoke from burning wool and cotton , a smoke that puts the heaviest tax on the endurance of firemen . They attacked the job without faltering . One climbed to the roof , and , running along the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Others spread through the building and knocked out the windows , through which others played streams of water . John B. Corrigan of Hook and Ladder Company 4 was knocking out the windows ou the third floor , where he had been sent by Acting Chief Martin Kelly , when .. near one of the windows on the . smith side he stumbled upon one of his comrades . The man was lying on face unconscious where he had fallen in an effort to reach the window . Corrigan picked up the prostrate form and , leaning out of the window , called for help . At the moment Walter o'Leary of Rescue Squad No . I was climbing up a ladder with a hose from which a highpressure stream was playing . Holding the hose under one arm , O'Leary grappled with the limp form of his comrade and succeeded in placing it between himself and the ladder . . Then he began his perilous descent .

He was revived by first aid and removed to the New York Hospital for further treatment . When O'Leary nad finished withqzmcq#Namee he joined in-the work of trying to revive . Corrigan Was formerly a Sergeant , in the Twelfth Infantry . He quit the guard about five years ago to join the Fire Department . Several times squads of men had to interrupt the work of fighting the flames to rescue comrades . Anthony King of Engine 34 was one of the first overcome .

O'Reilly of Engine 1 was found lying unconscious on the second floor . He was taken to Bellevue . Arthur Lewis of Engine 21 had his hand badly cut . As nearly as Colonel Bostwick and Abraham A. Bogardus. chief clerk of the arsenal , could estimate , there were about 400,000 rounds of small arms cartridges . 300,000 rounds of shrapnel , and 1,000 three-inch shells in the magazine . On the second floor were fifty pounds of calcium carbide , the fumes from which , when it became wet , added to the difficulties of the firemen . There were also about $5,000 worth of medical supplies in the building . On the second ' and third floors were 3,000 Springfield rifles and a large quantity of tentage , blankets . uniforms , supplies , and equipment of all kinds . These were packed in wooden cases . On the first and second floors there were also boxes and bales of condemned eqtripmerit consisting for the most part of discarded uniforms , blankets , and tents . It was said that the supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last five years , due to the fact that since the mobilization of the guard for service on the Mexican border a large ySit of the supplies had been distributed among the various troops . Within the last few weeks fifteen carloads of material had come . into the arsenal for distribution , and most of this , with some of the regular reserve stock , had been sent out . Ordinarily 1,000,000 rounds of small arms ammunition are held in reserve . On the office walls were relics of American wars , collected by the late Colonel Joseph G.

The records of the Arsenal since it was built in 1859 were in a safe and in fireproof filing cases . The firemen and members of the staff who went in the building after the fire was got under control said that most of the damage on the upper floors was the result or smoke and water . Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accurate estimate of the damage until today . Fire Chief Martin , after an investigation , concluded that the fire had started in an airshaft , which carried the flames to the stories above . Defective insulation seemed to be the cause . The offices will probably be removed to the National Guard quarters in the Municipal Building and the Arsenal demolished
