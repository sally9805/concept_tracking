txt Commodore E. C. Benedict , banker and yachtsman , will sail from here this morning on a four months ' cruise on Summer waters and under Summer skies . The yacht Alvina has been chartered for the trip , and in the party will be Mrs. Clifford Harmon , Commodore Benedict 's daugater ; her friends , Miss Mary Bird and Miss Mary Finley , daughter of Major Finley , U. S. A. , who is stationed in the Philippines ; Colgate Hoyt , L. L. Benedict , Edward Beers , Commodore Frank S. Hastings , A. T. Rutter of Para , and Dr. Harrison B. Arnold , who will look after the health of the party . The Commodore never cares to get so far away from nis business interests that he can not he communicated with , and some time ago he obtained a license from ' the Brazilian Government to operate a wireless from Para to Manoas. a distance of about one thousand miles . Then word came that the Brazilians had revoked his license . The Commodore went to Washington and had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter and see that his rights were protected . I The Commodore was asked last night why his license had been revoked . He an-swered : " I do n't know anything about it . How should I know why they have deprived me of it . The only reason that I can think of is that they want all of those privileges themselves . " The Commodore , after he had obtained his license , built the necessary stations . The frequency of his trips to the Amazon made the investment look good enough , for it could be used by all vessels fitted with the wireless apparatus . The sudden revocation of the license looked like a great injustice and every effort will be made to protect the Commodore and per , mit him to use this equipment . a unchal , ane of the deserted islands of the Made ' iras , has been connected by the Brazilian I Government with a submarine telegraph line that reaches from Lisbon to Brazil , and Is the property of a native company . It may be that this company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would threaten to curtail its business . But the Commodore does n't know anything about that , and while he would like to know the outcome of whatever action Secretary - Knox takes he is n't going to wait for it , but will . sailaway with - the hope that the matter will aojust itself before his arrival within the territory coyered by his wireless system . The itinerary of the trip has been arranged in a most elae:dc fashion . It may . lie-fcllowed and it may not be , according to the wishes of the party . At present it provides for a straight journey to St. Thomas , to Barbados , to Para , up the I Amazon River to Manoas , and then back to Para . There , if all goes well , the party will go to Rio de Janeiro , to Buenos ; Ayres , and thence by rail to- Valparaiso . Here a. considerable stop may be made , land then the party will return to Buenos Ayres and to Rio de Janeiro . After this it is possible that there may be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1st ' and of Sicily . . Nearly all of the trip will be made in sections where the thermometer rarely falls below 68 degrees and very seldom gets above 95 . The Commodore does not know Just how many miles will be tray , ersed by the yacht before the cruise is over , but if he cares to he can send his craft over 30,000 miles on the Amazon and its tributaries . The party will do a lot of fishing in the Amazon , that teems with the finest edible fishes , and especially with the pira necu , that is the staple food of the natives . ' Also the party may shoot alligators. jaguars , bears , and pan , thers . No difficulty need be overcome in . capturing enough turtles to make the stable of the yacht a canstant delight . ' The Alvina is fitted with wireless , and if the Brazilian Government does n't continue to prevent the Commodore from using it the sending and receiving of messages will be an additional pleasure to the Iparty . The yacht has twin screws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet on the water line . 26 feet 10 inches beam . 16 feet 11 inches depth of hold . and 13 feet 7 inches draught .

Her piston has a twentytwo-inch stroke . The international signal letters are Ft Q P G. The yacht is fitted up In the most sumptuous manner , and the accommodations are ample enough to give each one of the party as much privacy as he would have on an ocean liner . The Commodore is familiar with the whole country over which he intends to journey on this trip . Last March he and a party started off for a two months ' trip on the yacht Virginia , and with pretty much the same itinerary as the present ' one . Before the end of this voyage the Yacht grounded on Colorado Reef , off Cuba , and much alarm was felt here for the safety of the voyagers . But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accident and said that he had enjoyed every minute of his vacation . Several years before this the I Commodore steamed up the Amazon as ; far as Manoas , which is the farthest point up that mighty river ever reached by a steam yacht . Friends . of the Commodore say that he Is a real sailor , and not merely a yachtsman . When he is afloat his craft is rare ' ly tied to a wharf . She is kept moving . In the Fall of 1910 he came from Bermuda in his little yacht Oneida and followed the big liner Trent toward this city . For three days and nights on that trip nobody was on deck save two of the crew , who were lashed to the bridge . Relating this experience after his arrival . the Commodore described it as five days of terror . The Commodore is well known along all of the thousand miles between Para and Tkla.noas . At the latter place the Chamber of Commerce usually entertains him . and the natives gather to greet him and to engage in @ @ @ @ @
