txt // cult to imagine . The dissecting-room is a dark apartment in the basement , in which ( December 14 ) the year 's dissecting had not yet begun ; but the teaching of anatomy was not therefore halted . A disorderly room with a small amount of morbid material and equipment is known as the pathological and bacteriological laboratory . The chemical laboratory contains a few desks , with reagent bottles , mostly empty . There are a few old books in the faculty-room . No charts , museum , models , or other teaching accessories are to be seen . Clinical facilities : There was formerly a hospital in the same building , but it is now closed . The school claims to hold clinics at certain private institutions , in which , however , the work is mainly surgical and the cases not free . Except by attending amphitheatre clinics at the city hospital , it is not clear that the Pulte students can regularly see any hospital medical cases at all . There is an inexpressibly bad dispensary in the school building . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down as passable . The following , which is situated in Atlanta , ' is neither the best nor the worst : " Georgia College of Eclectic Medicine and Surgery . Organized 1877 . An independent institution . Entrance requirement : Nominal . Attendance : 66 . Teaching staff : 20 , of whom 14 are professors and 6 of other grade . Resources available for maintenance : Fees , amounting to $5655 ( estimated ) . Laboratory facilities : The school occupies a building // which , in respect to filthy conditions , has few equals , but no superiors , among medical schools . Its anatomy room , containing a single cadaver , is indescribably foul ; its chemical laboratory ' is composed of old tables and a few bottles , without water , drain , lockers , or reagents ; the pathological and histological laboratory ' contains .. few dirty slides and three ordinary microscopes . Clinical facilities : The school is practically without clinical facilities . The outfit in obstetrics is limited to a tattered manikin . Nothing more disgraceful calling itself a medical school can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if possible , still worse , and so rankly mercenary in character that their clinical patients , even those who are treated by the students , are invariably charged for treatment . How much suffering humanity can hope for from a science of healing , the leading text-books of which are a ledger and a bank-book , the reader may readily conjecture . Summing up the work of the osteopathic schools , Mr. Flexner says : " The eight osteopathic schools now enroll over 1300 students , who pay some $200,000 annually in fees . The instruction furnished for this sum is inexpensive and worthless . Not a single full-time teacher is found in any of them . The fees find their way directly into the pockets of the school owners , or into school buildings and infirmaries that are equally their property . No effort is anywhere made to utilize prosperity as a means of defining an entrance standard or developing the science . ' Granting all that its champions claim , osteopathy is still in its incipiency . If sincere , its votaries would be engaged in critically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind . Indeed , in none // of the sectarian schools does one observe progressive effort even along the lines of its own creed . " But the sectarian , or so-called " irregular " schools are only a fifth of the total , and so we must examine the " regular " institutions if we would know the true conditions of medical education . Here is Chattanooga Medical College , for example , as found by Mr. Flexner in January of last year : " Chattanooga Medical College , Chattanooga . Organized 1889 . The medical department of the University of Chattanooga . Entrance requirement : Nominal . Attendance : 112 . Teaching staff : 25 , of whom 11 are professors , 14 of other grade . Resources available for maintenance : Fees , amounting to 84290 . Laboratory facilities : The school occupies a small building , externally attractive ; the interior , dirty and disorderly , is almost bare except for a fair chemical laboratory in good condition . The dissecting-room contains two tables ; the single room assigned to histology , pathology , and bacteriology contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil-immersion microscope . The instructor explained that they study only non-pathogenic microbes ; students do not handle the pathogenic . ' There is nothing further in the way of laboratory outfit ; no museum , books , charts , models , etc . Clinical facilities : Amphitheatre clinics are held at the Erlanger Hospital , which averages about 50 free patients . Students may not enter the wards . Perhaps ten obstetrical cases annually are obtainable , students being summoned , ' ? just how is not clear . The students see no post-mortems , no contagious diseases , do // no blood or urine work , and do not always own their own text-books . They use quiz-compends instead . There is no dispensary . This is a typical example of the schools that claim to exist for the sake of the poor boy and the back country . " Summing up his impressions of this class of schools , Mr. Flexner says : " As a matter of fact , many of the schools mentioned in the course of this recital are probably without re-deeming features of any kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the class-rooms are bare , save for chairs , a desk , and an occasional blackboard ; the windows streaked with dust and soot . In wretched amphitheatres students wait in vain for professors , ' tardy or absent , amusing the interval with ribald jest and song . The teaching is an uninstructive rehearsal of text-book or quiz-compend : one encounters surgery taught without patient , instrument , model , or drawing ; recitations in obstetrics without a manikin in sight , ? often without one in the building . Third and fourth year men are frequently huddled together in the same classes . At the Memphis Hospital Medical Col lege the students of all four years attend the same classes in many of the subjects taught . " " I wish , " wrote Dr. Arthur Dean Bevan ' ( of Chi cago ) , a couple of years ago , " that every member of the American Medical Association could have made the inspection of the medical schools of this country with our committee last year and seen the farce of attempt ing to teach modern medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without laboratories , without trained and salaried men , without dispensaries and without hospitals . Schools were found which were mere quiz classes , where students were given just enough text-book knowledge to attempt state board examinations , and where the teacher looked for his compensation in consultations sent him by his illy-qualified pupils . " As already pointed out , however , the low-grade school is passing , for the simple reason , apart from the tardy action of our legislators , that the peculiar conditions that made it possible , and sometimes even useful , to our sturdy , pioneer civilization , have long since passed away . Of course , the energy with which we accelerate its departure may make a difference of thousands of lives , and I do not want to discourage action , but the law of supply and demand seems to have anticipated us by many years . As Doctor Bevan emphasizes in the paper already quoted from : " The supply of physicians far exceeds the demand . From the standpoint of demand , therefore , the excuse for low standards of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer exists . Medicine , too , has changed . The known facts of medicine thirty years ago might have been taught in a two years ' course of didactic lectures by a few men . To-day the known facts in medicine , which must be mastered before a student becomes a qualified practitioner , require much more time , a thorough preliminary preparation , and a thorough laboratory and hospital training . " It is pleasing to note that this reform is not all from the outside , that some of the struggling little institutions which , in spite of their meagre endowments and // scanty equipment , did really serve their day and gener ation , have voluntarily closed when they realized that their work was no longer of benefit to their state or community . Of such was the Nebraska College of Medicine , which closed its doors on May 19th of last year . In an open letter to the president of Nebraska Wesleyan University , with which the school was affili ated , Dr. J. F. Stevens , the dean , sets forth the reasons for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call your attention to the fact that educators and physicians throughout the United States , recognizing the inferiority , on the whole , of the American medical schools , as compared with those of Europe , have determined to raise the standard of medical education to such a point that our colleges will command the respect of the world . While academic training and opportunity have grown into magnificent and commanding proportions , the professional schools , with the exception of a small minority , have remained essentially elementary or even worse . The spirit of progress has at last become supreme and on all sides may be seen the work of destruction , reorganization , and rebuilding . The American Medical Association is doing a splendid work in securing and digesting statis tics , and reflecting the strengths and deficiencies of our institutions . The Carnegie Foundation , in a different manner , lends its words of wisdom , and a multitude of smaller bodies and societies , including state examining boards , are working together with hardly a discordant note , for the same purpose . Standards of entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one full year 's work in an accepted college or university is required for matriculation . Soon it will be two years , // and later a bachelor 's degree will , without doubt , be the sine qua non . Small colleges that have found it impossible to stand the strain of such requirements have been forced either to step from the field altogether , or to merge with some other school . In several states nearly , or quite , all of the small schools have been blended with the state institution . At the same time the requirement is going forth that schools shall have at their disposal a dispensary and hospitals sufficiently patronized to permit of a very wide study of disease . These requirements can not be met in a small city . Again , with the rapid advancement in medicine has come the need of costly laboratories , under the direction of highly cultured men . Subjects , too , that once belonged to the mere mention ' hour in the course of study , have developed into great fields with divisions and subdivisions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly for its proper teaching . None of these requirements insisted on by educators and the medical profession generally is in excess of what it should be , and this institution is in full harmony with that view . . . . We fully realize tlia to maintain our standing and dignity as medical teachers , in the continuance of our college , it will be necessary to add to our working force a goodly number of trained instructors . This we can not do , and because of this , and for the reasons easily deduced from the above discussion , it has been decided that it is best for our institution voluntarily to close its doors , in the interest of higher medical education . " Of course the colleges described as " commercial , " " sectarian " and " low-grade " are , as a rule , the lesser known institutions . Much better conditions obtain in the average university or state school , and many are famous for their elaborate equipments , their well-atEDUCATION // tended clinics , their exceptional hospital privileges or the strength of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to boast of all their departments ; few , in fact , are free from some glaring defect , such as Dartmouth without a dispensary , Harvard with limited hospital facilities , Syracuse lacking in obstetrical material , Arkansas " bare of equipment , " Leland Stanford Junior , in a condition of disorganization and lacking hospital advantages , Kansas without a library , and so on almost to the end of the list . Perhaps a dozen institutions have in their organization , support , equipment , hospital and dispensary relations , the attainments of their instructors , and , above all , in their ideals , and the indefinable " atmosphere " that has been created , reached a plane of efficiency where true , unhampered progress may be looked for . I emphasize ideals , since the elementary truth is often lost sight of that mere mechanical efficiency , or overconfidence in laboratory training , or chauvinism , or the worship of authority , or the arrogance born of much pedantry ? any or all of these factors may utterly destroy that elusive spirit that ennobled so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine , with all its ignorance and crudities , a positive boon to mankind . A word as to standards . Estimating our colleges at 150 , we have exactly 150 standards of education . No two schools use quite the same methods or have marked out quite the same goal . This , in the abstract , is by no means a disadvantageous condition and may always ue relied on to save our institutions from the paralysis of over-systematization or the deadening effect of a saturating " scientific pedantry. " // But we are a long way yet from such dangers . I inn indebted to Dr. Henry Beates , Jr . ( of Philadelphia ) 1 for one of the most startling tables that has yet been compiled . For instance , obstetrics in one college , ac-cording to Doctor Beates ' investigation , requires 460 hours for its proper teaching , while another college manages to render its students proficient in 52 hours . General surgery in one college requires 2221 hours , while another college accomplishes the same task in 78 hours . In the same colleges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pathology in one school requires 646 hours , in another 48 . Anatomy takes 1248 hours in one college , 126 in another . Physi ology varies from 750 to 56 hours , the latter in no less a school than the University of Virginia . Chemistry varies from 756 to 78 hours ; bacteriology from 660 to 30 hours . Neurology varies from 327 hours down to 10 ; dermatology and syphilis from 447 to 10 ; laryn gorhmology , 432 to 16 hours ; genito-urinary work from 480 hours to 4 ; medical jurisprudence from 775 hours to none ! I had intended going at much greater length into this phase of the subject , but I think enough facts have been submitted to prove to the reader that medical education is far from what it ought to be , and that the raw product of the majority of our schools is a thor oughly dangerous element . And I think the fact has been fairly demonstrated that the public , quite as much as the student , is to blame for the unfortunate but inevitable consequences of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , try to bear this in mind while we follow the student in his early career as a practitioner . I knew a young graduate who was called suddenly to attend a child in convulsions . The little one had eaten something that did not agree with it and when the young doctor arrived he found it livid , struggling violently , and quite unconscious . He thought of all he had been told to do under such circumstances and decided to give the child a hot bath . Not finding any hot water in the house , however , he procured a boiler , and filling it with lukewarm water put it on a red hot stove to heat . Up to this point he had acted very wisely , but in his inexperience he forgot that the bottom of the vessel on a hot stove may heat much more rapidly than its contents . Fearing that his little patient might die before its bath was ready , he put the unconscious form into the boiler and there held it until the water was warm enough to suit him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only had a hot bath and gotten over its convulsions , but was screaming with pain . Its little legs , back and hands , pressed against the over-heated bottom , were frightfully blistered . The excited doctor , thinking only of how to cure convulsions , was actually burning the child to death . Two days later the undertaker 's wagon carried away the little body . More comic than tragic was the attempt of an overconfident young graduate of my acquaintance to remove warts from the face of a young lady , otherwise beautiful , and a recognized belle in her social set . His method , it appears , was to cut off the warts and apply a strong solution of nitrate of silver ( lunar caustic ) . // The young surgeon , for so he accounted himself , successfully removed the warts , but , not satisfied with touching up the roots with the nitrate of silver , he painted the surrounding skin . Unfortunately he let some of the solution run down his patient 's face , which necessitated vigorous swabbing , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the greater part of her face and neck . It was certainly a thorough job . Next day , however , to his surprise and mortification , he was visited by an irate father and ordered to come instantly to relieve his daughter 's distress . The poor girl 's face , he found , had turned black and was swollen to immense proportions . An infection had likewise set in and the poor doctor awoke to the fact that his treatment for warts was not nearly so simple as he had supposed . All ended well , however , except that the warts came back . An experienced physician was called in consultation and proper remedies applied , and so , when the danger of a malpractice suit had passed , our young surgeon found himself minus a patient , but much richer in his knowledge of nitrate of silver . One of the first essentials to learn about the treatment of the average gunshot wound is not to probe for the bullet . Some professors , whose diplomas date from the time of the civil war , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , many students who have heard the matter mentioned have mislaid their surgical notes , and , forgetting whether they were told to probe , or not to probe , have in their youthful ardor decided on prompt action . If an X-ray apparatus were lying conveniently near , their memories might be accidentally refreshed. // I was called to an urgent case one night and found a negro who had been shot and was bleeding profusely . The young physician who was treating him was much alarmed over the copious hemorrhage , which he described to the family as " subsequent hemorrhage , following shooting , " whatever that might mean . The man had been shot in the calf of the leg , and as the bullet had not " come out , " my friend had been called in six or seven hours later . There was no hemorrhage when he arrived ; it had started after the probing . I asked him if he thought he could have injured any of the deep vessels . He replied that he " did not think so " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to just what had happened , and did not seem to appreciate the danger of profuse bleeding , since he had almost allowed the man to die before sending for me . I succeeded in stopping the hemorrhage and left , after warning him against the dangers of infection . But this young man 's watchword was " action , " and he got to poulticing the wound . His patient died two weeks later ; cause assigned ? pneumonia ! Dr. F. H. was an over-confident young graduate with ambitions toward surgery . Almost the first case that he attempted was that of a child with tubercular glands of the neck , which he proposed to remove , using cocaine anxsthesia . This , of course , as any practitioner would have told him , is a formidable operation , owing to the network of blood-vessels and nerves found in that region . But anatomical structures and delicate tissues were negligible quantities to H. , whose only desire was to get out the " lumps . " When he made the second deep incision , however , he encountered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of a miniature Niagara of blood . Thanks to his wonderful nerve and unusual good fortune , he was able to stop the hemorrhage before it was too late . Repeated injections of saline solution into the vein of the arm , and exceptionally good nursing , were instrumental in saving the little sufferer 's life ; but it was a long time before she recovered from the awful and unnecessary ordeal she had passed through . Seven months later her parents took her to a large city hospital where the tubercular glands were removed in approved fashion . Such cases as these ? and I could continue them indefinitely ? are not necessarily examples either of insufficient college training or of culpability on the part of the student . As a matter of fact , Doctor H. comes from one of our best medical schools , and I happen to know that he was an unusually brilliant student . His education simply was not finished . He had conscientiously read his text-books , ( lone his dissection and scanty laboratory work , taken his lectures , attended clinics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent shape ? not for independent practice , but for a practical , supplementary training . For there is no denying the fact that the young graduate begins his real education in the hospital , where he secures an interneship , or in the post-graduate schools abroad , which set him to work in the clinics and laboratories , or under an older doctor who keeps a watchful eye on his every movement . This is doing , not memorizing ; gaining experience and technique , rather than cramming unintelligible formulas from quiz-compends . He is now an apprentice , applying his crude science and slowly developing his embryonic art . // But what of the host of young graduates who do not , or can not , choose any of these paths , ? the ninety per cent . or so who essay an independent practice the moment they have secured the necessary state permit ? They also must acquire a practical education , and they must do it without the aid of hospitals , post-graduate schools or watchful masters . By what means and at what cost is their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they receive their practical experiences at the expense of the community ? their real education is acquired at the cost of human life . Let us glance again behind the scenes . The young graduate , who would cheerfully operate for appendicitis or undertake a confinement case the day he has received his license , has acquired a stock of theories more or less applicable to the general practice of medicine ; he has imbibed much good advice ( and some bad ) , which he dutifully jotted down at the time , in indecipherable hieroglyphics ; he has learned to take himself seriously . His ostensible mission in life is to heal the sick ; but having had little or no actual training in therapeutics , and less in surgery , he naturally finds himself nonplussed by the simplest case of measles , or by a fracture of the thumb . The art of diagnosis , he discovers , is a veritable pons asinorum , and so he has surreptitiously to familiarize himself with a hundred diseases or ailments and a thousand conflicting symptoms , noting the results , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remedy , and tremblingly confiding to his associates or superiors the difficulties he has encountered . All the while , perhaps for years if his preliminary education has been faulty or insufficient , he is forced to cultivate a pompous , overbearing de74 MEDICAL CHAOS AND CRIME meanor , the better to hide his ignorance and cloak his oft-recurring blunders . All of which is bad enough from the standpoint of his victims , but if his nature is not robust enough to withstand such corrupting influences , his whole character may be undermined . In short , a system , for which he is by no means responsible , forces him to practise chicanery and deceit , and when such practices are no longer necessary , his ideals have vanished . He then becomes selfish , arrogant , and unsympathetic ; fond of subterfuge , and so skilled in the game of " bluff " that technical skill and knowledge appear of very secondary importance . Having successfully educated himself as a general practitioner at the expense of the community , he next decides to acquire a " specialty " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " self-acknowledged expert who has solved the difficult problem of giving nothing for something . " This is the logical outcome of our present system ? an unscrupulous , inefficient profession ; a victimized public . CHAPTER IV THE UNSPEAKABLE QUACK The Criminaloid . " By this ( term ) we designate such as prosper by flagitious practices which have not yet come under the effective ban of public opinion . Often , indeed , they are guilty in the eyes of the law ; but since they are not culpable in the eyes of the public and in their own eyes , their spiritual attitude is not that of the criminal . The law-maker may make their misdeeds crimes , but , so long as morality stands stock-still in the old tracks , they escape both punishment and ignominy . Unlike their low-browed cousins , they occupy the cabin rather than the steerage of society . Relentless pursuit hems in the criminals , narrows their range of success , denies them influence . The criminaloids , on the other hand , encounter but feeble opposition , and , since their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they distance their more scrupulous rivals in business and politics and reap an uncommon worldly prosperity . " ? Professor Edward Alsworth Ross , in the Atlantic Monthly . As the main purpose of this book is an arraignment of the legalized abuses , if I may so word it , of the medical profession , it might seem at first thought that the advertising quacks and their methods were beneath our notice . This , however , is a mistake . Humiliating though the admission is , the fact remains that some of the most shameless of these outcasts are nevertheless legitimate practitioners of medicine . And as the law is now interpreted and enforced in most states , nine out of every ten manufacturers or vendors of patent medicines , provided these are not misbranded , are in as legitimate a business as though they were making cloth , // or bread , or other necessaries of life , instead of undermining the health of the community . The modern quack , I repeat , is too often a bona fide doctor ; that is to say , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded in passing a State Board examination , thereby receiving his license the same as other practitioners . But these gentry are radically different in character and temperament from the " ethical " doctor , no matter how far the latter may depart , in secret , from the high standards with which he started . For the reputable practitioner is at least governed in his outward conduct by the conventions and proprieties of the profession , whereas the quack knows no law , social or professional , and is equally ready to violate legislative enactments , provided that he can keep out of jail . He is a moral defective , in short , a highgrade criminal who employs his medical knowledge simply and solely as a cloak for graft and imposture . That he finds a lucrative field and a never-failing mine of wealth in the complete ignorance , the morbid fears and the easy gullibility of the unsuspicious public , goes without saying . It is a well-known but none the less curious fact that many persons of unusual intelligence ? shrewd , hardheaded business men , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? will frequently " fall " for some crude and obvious imposture in the form of a patent medicine , or an " electric " belt , or a " radium " brace , or the like . And what is more , they are not open to argument in such a matter . They will show implicit faith in " testimonials , " which if submitted to them in support of anything else would arouse nothing but contempt . All of which goes to support // the old adage that " knowledge is power . " Where we do not know , there is no alternative , but to believe or disbelieve , and our course is usually in the direction of our hopes and desires . Such gullibility is next to impossible in those whose minds have had the discipline of scientific training . The ordinary untrained intellect , no matter what the degree of native common sense , does not readily appreciate the difference between authoritative knowledge and baseless assertion . The extravagant and preposterous claims made by quacks , obviously false and impossible to those who know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not know . Instead of consulting the family physician , a man who has spent a lifetime in the management of disease , these dupes will secretly buy a wonderful new " catarrh cure , " or an absurd " electric belt . " Being unfamiliar with scientific thought , they are on unfamiliar ground from the start . Under the spell of a smooth-spoken quack , they will eagerly buy the gold bricks handed out to them , and clamor for more . Even in New York , the great metropolis , such advertisements as the following are constantly appearing ; and though generally suppressed and their imaginative authors frequently prosecuted , other outlandish claims just as rapidly crop out . These , of course , are oldtime quacks , despite their modern nomenclature , and so render themselves liable to arrest : " Dr. C. Conrad , Founder , President and Medical Director of Vetus Academia Physio Medica ( Inc . ) , Founder , President and Director-in-Chief of the Platen Institute ( Inc . ) , Lecturer on Psychology and Physiology in the Old Physio Medical College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MEDICAL CHAOS AND CRIME therapy at Platen Institute ; Founder and President of New York Society of Osteotherapeutic Physicians ; Founder and Editor-in-Chief of the Twentieth Century Journal in Osteotherapy ; Vice-President of the Ameri-can Association of Physicians .

" It is scarcely necessary to say that these institutions and societies were largely fictitious or else specially created by " Doctor " Conrad for his exclusive benefit . " Doctor " Starken 's generous choice of baths also sug-gests a lively imagination , though the dupes who fre-quented his erstwhile popular establishment firmly be-lieved in the doctor 's ability to " deliver the goods .

Nifty-second Street and Broad-way , New York . " In Germany the public is protected by the most stringent laws against quackery , and those who attempt to circumvent the law usually land in prison . Only re-cently an advertising quack was sentenced to a long term of imprisonment with hard labor for " promising the impossible . " Were such drastic measures taken in this country , I doubt if Sing Sing would accommodate the sudden accession to our criminal population . // In Germany , moreover , there is a wide-spread re-spect for authority and learning , so that the people look naturally to the medical profession to decide in such matters , and woe betide the gentleman who is officially denounced as a charlatan . In England , if the public do not pay quite so much deference to the doctors , they invariably listen to Henry Labouchere , the editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more has fought and exposed every kind of fraud and humbug . But to find the ideal remedy for quackery and its at-tendant evils one has to go to New Zealand , where the recent Quackery Prevention Act holds the publisher of fraudulent advertising as equally guilty with the ad-vertiser . Clause 5 of the Act reads as follows : " If any person causes any statement to be inserted in breach of this act in a newspaper printed and published in New Zealand , the printer , publisher and proprietor of that newspaper shall severally ( and without exclud-ing the liability of any other person ) be deemed to have published that statement in breach of this act , and shall be liable for an offence against this act accordingly . " Of course , we have laws against ' fraud , which , if properly enforced , would soon clear the country of every kind of medical swindler . " Obtaining money under false pretences " is a misdemeanor at common law and by statute in nearly every state in the Union . Why , then , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons . First , because the American people like to be humbugged ; and secondly , because the fakers have plenty of money and use it freely , both with the press and with legislators , to ensure their protect // tion . The exhaustive exposures made by the American Medical Association and similar bodies are thus , to a large extent , ignored , and quacks continue to " promise the impossible " and acquire vast fortunes by preying upon the credulous and ignorant sick . Their license to practise is therefore made as legal as that of the decent medical practitioner . As Mr. Labouchere puts it , we authorize them to " help to fill our hospitals end cemeteries . " Nevertheless the State of New York discovered the other day that it has an old law specifically prohibiting " untrue and misleading advertisements . " Assistant District Attorney Moscowitz , of New York City , who unearthed it , applied it successfully against a dealer who advertised that he had purchased several thousand raincoats at a " customs seizure " and was going to sell them at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such seizure had been made , and so the aston-ished dealer found himself under arrest . " Now that the ball has been set rolling , " writes the editor of the Journal of the A. M. A. , " the possibilities of this resuscitated law seem great . For instance , the Dr. A. C. Sanden Company advertises in the New York papers the wonderful virtue of its health belt . ' A man wearing this device can not grow old ; he must be young forever . ' Would this come in the untrue and mislead-ing ' class ? In another New York paper of the same date we are told of the miraculous cures of cataract , ' in fact , all eye diseases , ' which the Magic Eye-Lotion brings about ! Can this be untrue and misleading ' ? And , in another line of activity , we are told through a New York paper that the bland qualities ' of White Rock " make high-balls harmless . ' Either this is un-true and misleading or physiologic chemistry needs reTHE // vising . These are but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad and there is no lack of material to work on . " " As one learns in detail of the methods and dangers of the modern medicine quack , " writes Mr. Champe S. Andrews in the Medical News , i " there is at first a ten dency to believe that the credulity of mankind is grow ing alarmingly greater , but a deeper study of the sub ject shows that the credulity upon which the charlatan relies , is the credulity that arises from weakened powers of resistance , from disordered minds , and from the mirage that such minds see mirrored in the clear sky of hope . The victim of the medical mountebank , by reason of his susceptibilities and infirmities , is in a class to himself and should have the especial care of the State . " And so he does abroad ? here it is the " mountebank " who gets all the protection . In an investigation of the psychology of quack in fluences , one fact is brought out with peculiar distinct ness , viz. , that all successful appeals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common-place symptoms of slight indisposition or the most trifling ailment . Certain erroneous beliefs regarding the gravity of these symptoms have consequently be-come firmly implanted , and when a physician contra dicts them he is regarded with surprise and incredulity . The quack , on the other hand , fosters and strengthens all these delusions by every means in his power . To illustrate this I will mention a few of the most common of the exaggerated symptoms . Pain in the back is popularly supposed to indicate // kidney disease . Especially must this be so if the pain is felt in the " small of the back , " a mysterious area located anywhere from the neck to the lower end of the spine . Now , as a matter of fact , the serious diseases of the kidney seldom or never give rise to pain in the back . Such pain as is commonly experienced there is almost invariably from muscular rheumatism , which is an insignificant affection and never dangerous to life . Nearly every person has , at one time or another , a touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But all have learned in a vague way of the terrors of Bright 's disease , and it is an easy matter to make sick or ailing people take the most far-fetched and gloomy view of their symptoms . Indeed , when we consider how few people know anything about anatomy or physiology , it is no wonder that the quacks reap such a rich harvest by playing on their ignorant fears . When the poor dupes have been positively assured that their pains in the back are kidney pains , the deception is carried still further by an inquiry whether the patient ever has to get up in the night to urinate . He remembers , with sinking heart , that this has happened occasionally , though he forgets that at such times he probably drank an extra cup of tea or coffee for dinner . The quack shakes his head sagely and says he must analyze a specimen of the urine . This he does in the patient 's presence , impressing his ignorance by a display of test tubes , burners and colored chemicals . The usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then add a little bicarbonate of soda . Now when these two substances are mixed together ? even in clear water ? they combine chemically , with an ebullition of carbonic acid gas . The trembling patient witnesses this experiment with vague // terror , and begs to know what it means . Then the quack places a hand on his shoulder and says : " My friend , I will not deceive you . You are in an advanced stage of Bright 's disease . It 's lucky you came to me , however , for I am the only man in the city who under-stands kidney disease , if I do say it myself . I will guarantee to cure you in six months . If you go to any other doctor you will be dead in three months . " Pain about the region of the heart is erroneously supposed to be a symptom of heart disease , but just as pain in the back seldom or never indicates kidney trou-ble , so pain near the heart is scarcely ever present in organic heart disease . This pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the heart by many nerves . Thus stomach trouble , or indigestion , often reacts upon the heart and , at times , causes an irregular-ity in its beat . So that , owing to the great prevalence of stomach trouble in America , the quacks do a big business in " heart disease . " Another trump card for the quack to play is vari-cocele , which is an exceedingly common condition among men . Now small varicoceles do no harm whatever , and even larger ones , though they may cause slight discom-fort , are practically harmless . Should they become troublesome they may easily be removed by a simple surgical operation ? otherwise a suspensory is all that is needed . The quacks , however , make the astounding statement that varicocele is the first stage of paralysis , and that , if not treated early , and by their particular method , the patient is doomed . A little knowledge of anatomy and physiology would show any man what a varicocele is and how it is formed , and such knowledge would also convince him of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varicocele could have any causative influence in paralysis . Catarrh is yet another of the quack 's great strongholds , and for the same reason as the foregoing , namely , that it is a very common complaint . But , while it is an annoying affection , it is not in the least dangerous , although it is usually chronic in its course and difficult to get entirely rid of , hence being an ideal complaint for the quack 's purpose . What more easy than to inform a patient that his catarrh will surely lead to consumption , cancer or glanders ? The alarmed but unsuspecting dupe accordingly pays down a sum of money and starts in with a formidable course of treatment , which lasts just as long as his money and patience hold out . But perhaps the frauds that pay best of all are those based upon venereal diseases , real and imaginary . The scoundrels in this case usually resort to small pamphlets , purporting to set forth the evils and horrors of " lost manhood , " self-abuse , impotence and sterility . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youths and even boys . Men are often paid to stand on corners near to schools and other institutions to hand pamphlets to the boys as they come and go . It is a great pity that so much ignorance prevails among young people in regard to matters of sex , and that parents are so backward and diffident about mentioning them to their children . If such instruction were the rule , instead of the exception , boys and girls would be forewarned and forearmed against the real danger ? the danger that lies in ignorance . The result is usually a morbid curiosity to learn more of this subject about which there is so much mystery . Such curiosity is alTHE // ways satisfied in time , but secretly , and often through the vilest of companions and associations . The flaming literature of the quack at once arrests the attention of young men in this state of mind . The pamphlets are worded with diabolical art and cunning . The most ordinary and commonplace conditions are twisted into pathological symptoms . By the time a poor youth has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must be somehow a victim of venereal disease , even though he may never have been actually exposed to it . And if , in addition , he happens to have varicocele , he sees no future but that of an incurable paralytic . But at last a ray of hope illumines his darkened soul . The final paragraph states that the writer ? this altruistic being who consents to practise medicine solely in the interests of humanity ? has discovered the sovereign remedy . The victims of " youthful errors " and " lost manhood " may rely on him and him alone to save them . " Young men ! Come to mc , if you would be saved from the errors of youth ! " Some such legend is conspicuous in nearly every public toilet , a bait for the ignorant and unwary . But thousands of grown men , who ought to have better sense , patronize these charlatans for treatment of venereal diseases . And here is where one of the worst and most far-reaching evils occurs . A man engaged to be married has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jovial , alcoholic wind-up of a stag party , or perhaps his moral standard is so low that he does not consider his engagement as binding him to shun vicious associations . In any case he is now badly frightened , and in desperate haste to get // cured before the wedding day arrives . If sense has conquered shame he consults his family physician , and the latter strongly advises him to postpone his marriage indefinitely . For it takes not less than three years to cure syphilis , and at least six months to eradicate gonornccea . Just at this time , however , our Lothario reads a quack pamphlet . Ah , this is just what he wants ! " All venereal diseases ' cured to stay cured after a few weeks ' ( or days ' ) treatment . " So he rushes off to the " specialist , " and puts himself in his hands . In a brief time , as the latter promised , the symptoms have subsided or become obscured , and the marriage consequently takes place . A little later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loathsome venereal disease of which her husband thought the quack had cured him . The power and influence of the advertising quacks depends largely upon the complete ignorance of the general public in regard to all matters medical , anatomical and physiological . Very few people know where the liver is . Several times , while treating patients for obscure or doubtful cases of a certain disease , I have been seriously asked : " Doctor , if I really have n't this disease , is n't there danger that your medicine might give it to me ? " Absurd as is such a question , the enquirers have not always been fools . That it could be asked at all , and by persons otherwise intelligent , is a significant fact , and one that goes a long way toward accounting for the widespread and pernicious influence of the quacks . No better illustration of this appalling ignorance , coupled with complete credulity , could be found than the two pathetic cases given by Dr. J. E. Miller ( of Rogersville , Tennessee ) in the Journal of The American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Undoubtedly hundreds of thousands of such cases would be unearthed were a systematic investigation made by the federal or the various state authorities . " Case 1 . In the latter part of May , 1906 , I was sent for to amputate the breast of Mrs. M. T. , aged about 55 , who resided in this town . I found her in great agony . A cake of absorbent cotton covered the entire left breast , arm , side and back , down to the crest of the ilium . About three months prior to this time she had discovered a small , freely movable tumor about the size of a robin 's egg in the left breast ; it was not attended with pain or any discomfort . She became somewhat alarmed , and her sister , with whom she lived , found an advertisement in their religious paper of Dr. ' D. M. Bye and his ' Wonderful Oil Cure for Cancer . ' For many weeks prior to the time I saw her she had been using the ' oil cure ' with the result that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off from the extensive region covered by the absorbent cotton , which had become converted into an extensive scab . ( I see from one of his letters to her that the application of cotton was directed , and that in her case the oil ' had been somewhat modified , making it stronger . ) The condition was septic in the highest degree , suppuration and absorption going on beneath the cake of cotton . I was able to remove the dressing ' by insinuating peroxide of hydrogen beneath it , the whole coming off in one solid mass . The wound had the appearance of a deep-seated burn . The lump in the breast , I was informed , had undergone no perceptible change . The woman was in a pitiable condition and no operation was considered . She died from sepsis and exhaustion in two days after coming , under my observation . " The little tumor , while probably malignant , was r // not it factor in her taking off , but death , in my opinion , was directly due to the corrosive applications made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eared that she had paid the Bye concern $500 and at the time of her death a box of the treatment ' arrived at the express office , for which $50 had been paid . The Bye concern refused to take it back or to allow the sister anything whatever for it , although they had guaranteed a cure . Removal of the growth was the only treatment that should have been considered in this case . " " Case 2 . Mrs. B. , a widow , with several small children , totally blind from glaucoma , had been told by myself and other physicians that nothing whatever could be done to restore or in any manner to benefit her sight . She was written to by Dr. Coffee , Eye Specialist , ' whc , without the least idea of the nature of her trouble , undertook to guarantee a perfect cure . The woman was very poor , but she managed to pay him $8 a month for more than two years . When she could no longer raise the necessary amount , lie reduced the fee to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until it became utterly impossible for her to pay him anything whatever . Ile used the absorption ' method . His letters to this woman are before me , and are cunning and ingenious . They explain in a graphic manner that a meinbrain ' has formed over the sight , and just as soon as his medicine absorbs ' the growth , her vision will be as good as ever ; that vision would not return as long as there was a vestige of membrain , ' that the membrain was growing thinner all the time , ' and that it would return very suddenly , and that it would be disastrous to give up treatment , that , maybe one more application of his absorbent would have been sufficient . " As the reader is no doubt aware , two prominent periodicals ? Coll'ier 's Weekly and the Ladies ' Home // Journal ? have fearlessly exposed the quack and his methods , and in so thorough and energetic a manner that incalculable good has been done . Names and pbotographs were freely used , and so carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or two instances . Mr. Samuel Hopkins Adams ' series on " The Great American Fraud , " which ran in Collier 's , has since appeared in pamphlet form and has been largely distributed by the American Medical Association . Mr. Adams investigated every phase of the subject with a completeness and vigor that leaves nothing to be desired . Several of the leading quacks , knowing they were in for an exposure , wrote begging him to pass them with his big stick . But Adams , following the excellent example of Labouchere , spared none . Some of the most hideous schemes that he discovered were the so-called " cures " for drug habits . These " cures " were analyzed by expert chemists and found to contain large doses of morphine and cocaine . Another piece of deviltry was the " nasal catarrh spray , " which also contained cocaine . Use of this for a short time almost invariably develops the frightful cocaine liabit . This was the deliberate purpose of the quack , so that the victim would buy more and more of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " testimonials " as to the wonderful cures wrought by this and that quack or patent medicine , and in every case he found them spurious . Either they were paid for in cold cash , or else the testifiers were brought to admit that they lent their names and photographs because of the satisfaction derived from seeing themselves in print . // The two influential publications above mentioned , and many other prominent monthlies and weeklies , have long since dropped all patent medicine advertising even to hair tonics and medicated soaps . The city dailies , the coun-try weeklies , and especially the religious journals , are now the worst sinners in this respect , but it will be only a question of time till public opinion will demand as high a standard in the advertising columns of the press as in the body of the publication . When the privilege of advertising is denied to medical fakes , Uncle Sam will surely be shamed into denying them the use of the mails , either for circularizing the public , for receiving money , or for shipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unspeakable quack will have sunk into comparative harmlessness . In another gener-ation , I venture to assert , a gentleman following this nefarious calling will be quite as much of a curiosity as a savage wolf at large . Both wolf and quack , unless I am greatly mistaken , would find themselves promptly placed behind bars . But we must not overlook one great legislative vic-tory that has already been won . I refer to the Federal Pure Food Law which went into effect January 1 , 1906 , and has unquestionably protected the public from many of the grosser frauds that were so shamelessly prac-tised not only in the mishandling of drugs but in the drugging or adulterating of foods and liquors . The first case brought into court was that of Robert W. Harper , of Washington , D. C. , a bank president and capitalist , but also proprietor of Harper 's " Cuforhed-ake Branefude , " which , although extensiely advertised as harmless , was found to contain the following ingredients ; Mr. Harper , as may be remembered , was fined 5700 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturers and advertising quacks decided to change their calling . Just why a man may be punished for misbranding a preparation and yet al-lowed to tell the most preposterous falsehoods about its curative properties or about his own skill in medicine is , of course , not very clear . Nevertheless an excellent start has been made , and all who desire to see the sup-pression of quackery in all forms should take courage . In the meantime it behooves the regular practitioner not only to expose and condemn the practices of these swindlers , but to assure himself that he has been in no wise to blame for the deplorable evil . For , as Dr. John B. Roberts ( of Philadelphia ) remarks , ' " the sick often seek the advertising doctor , and believe the false as-sertions of the patent medicine label because they have found the medical men known to them to be incapable , inefficient or so exorbitant in fees that help seems im-possible at their hands . " " The family , " adds Roberts , " which can obtain ef-ficient medical aid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the hands of the recognized quacks . " CHAPTER V VIVISECTION-STRAINING AT THE GNAT " So long as civilization exacts pain and toil , suffering and death of the lower animals , not only for commercial and industrial reasons , but in many cases simply for the gratification of vanity or the indulgence of luxurious tastes , so long will the reformer , desiring to alleviate animal pain , find an ample field for the exercise of his well-meant efforts , without ignorantly interfering ; in the most altruistic of all scientific movements , viz. , the prevention and cure of the diseases to which mankind has long been heir . " ? From an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association . PERHAPS no subject pertaining to medicine has received so much public attention and been discussed so heatedly as vivisection . Certainly no subject has inspired such positive and conflicting opinions from lay writers . ' That one side must be largely in the wrong , either in its facts , or in the deductions based upon these alleged facts , goes without saying . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public has been on this matter , and how severe a blow would be dealt to science and universal progress were vivisection prohibited by law . I refer , of course , to animal vivisection ? human vivisection will be taken up in succeeding chapters . Vivisection , to the general laity , means the dissection of living animals without the employment of anesthetics , ostensibly for the advancement of science in reality to gratify a lust for cruelty . There can be no a , , t.ibt , after reading at random in the newspapers and magazines , that this is the popular conception . So , naturally and to the great credit of human nature , the belief // that such diabolical cruelty is rife among surgeons and biologists arouses extreme indignation , and a desire for legislation that will punish the offenders and protect the dumb sufferers from future outrage . But this idea is in most cases entirely erroneous , that is , so far as it relates to reputable surgeons and m ? dical instructors , and were there any truth in it none would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Surely their scathing denunciation of the real evils that have crept into the profession is sufficient proof that the charges of the antivivisectionists are largely fiction . Public opinion is not only unfair , but displays weak judgment when it classes these benefactors of the race with heartless students and degenerates who have been found guilty of torturing animals for the mere enjoyment of their suffering . And in striving to place a ban upon all animal experimentation , they would cripple the humanitarian labors of the most disinterested men of science while virtually encouraging that selfish indifference to human life that so alarmingly pervades our ranks . As the St. Louis Republican said of the proposed antivivisection law in Missouri : " It might fitly be called an act to substitute children and their parents for dogs , cats and mice in surgical experiments . " The true facts of scientific vivisection are these : When , in the interests of human life and health , it becomes desirable to ascertain , if possible , certain physiologic , pathologic or chemical processes , a suitable animal is chloroformed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then such section is performed , or such drugs introduced into the circulation , as is necessary for the demonstration . There was a time , not many decades ago , when vivi94 MEDICAL CHAOS AND CRIME section could be performed only on the quivering flesh of conscious animals , no matter how keen the repugnance of the experimenter to the suffering that lie caused . That time of horror was prior to the use of anwsthetics in 1846 . Then the most exquisitely painful surgical operations had to be performed without regard to the agony of the patient , whose body was usually bound to the operating table . The sufferer might hope for no relief during the terrible ordeal save when the torture became so excruciating that nature granted a blissful though brief unconsciousness . And following the operation came a long and tedious recovery , with inevitable infection of the wound by pus , and the added pain and suffering and blood poisoning caused largely by the surgeon 's hands , which his limited knowledge had not taught hint to disinfect . Now all this is changed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surgeon how to prevent pus infection ? two magnificent results . But to what do we owe our present knowledge of the properties of chloroform and other anaesthetics , and of the science underlying clean surgery ? To animal experimentation almost entirely . This is a matter of sober fact , and those who deny it merely display their ignorance of the history of scientific progress in surgery . Chloroform used ignorantly is an agent very dangerous to life . Before Sir James Simpson introduced it into surgical practice lie tested its effects upon animals . Many animals were killed in these experiments , but Sir James thereby learned its properties , its virtues and its dangers . Had he not used the animals for this purpose , several human lives would have necessarily been sacrificed and very possibly the fear excited by the first failures // would have prevented further experiments with so dangerous a substance . Was this grand result dearly bought , or wrongly bought , at the sacrifice of the lives of a few lower animals ? Those antivivisectionists who have never had to endure a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the ordeal , or seen a loved one under the knife , will pause and think before they condemn a knowledge so acquired , which has spared themselves and others the unspeakable anguish that our forefathers were forced to endure . Then as to clean modern surgery . Formerly it was the rule to have protracted and painful healing of wounds . Nowadays this is the exception . Why ? Because wound infection has been studied scientifically . Its causes are understood and every modern surgeon knows how it may be avoided . In the old days , before Lord Lister 's time , wound infection was so common as to be nearly invariable , and when , in very rare cases , it did not occur , the phenomenon was regarded with wonder and even suspicion . This gave rise to a gross surgical misconception . The formation of pus was actually hailed as a favorable sign , and hence came the absurd misnomer " laudable pus . " We of to-day know that pus , far from being laudable , is the surgical result of all others to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood-poisoning , deformity , suffering and death . Furthermore , the occurrence of pus in a supposed surgically clean wound is generally a serious reflection on the technique and ability of the surgeon . All must admit that this knowledge of antiseptics and aseptics is an immense boon to humanity . It would seem that almost any sacrifice would have been justifiable , or // at least excusable , to secure this end . And how was this knowledge arrived at ? By experiments on animals : in no other way could it have been gained , except by actual experiment on human beings . Are the lives of a few dogs , rabbits and guinea-pigs , then , to be put in the balance against the present and future welfare of hu-manity ? The endeavor to improve the condition of domestic animals is certainly laudable . No one is fonder of horses and dogs than is the writer of this book , and none could feel greater resentment towards those who ill-treat them . According to the religious systems of the East , humanity owes to the animal kingdom a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic animals , is supposed to be essential to their further evolution . This is a beautiful idea , being , in fact , the spiritual concomitant of the Darwinian theory of physical evolution . But there is a moral danger in these humane movements in the interests of the " lesser children " of nature . It is an obvious fact that those vbo are prominent in such societies are liable to become abnormally interested in animal welfare and comfort . There is a strong tendency to exaggerate the importance and sensibility of the lower animals both in nature and in their relation to mankind . And with this abnormal interest in animals there appears , not uncommonly , a corresponding indifference to , or even dislike of , children . This attitude is not by any means confined to members of humane societies . In the high and fast society of the mentally resourceless rich it is the rule for young married women to display absurd affection for pet dogs , and to refuse to become mothers . Often we see such women lavish affection ? or what resembles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the next repulse an attractive child . Indeed it is the cult of the dog , as . the British Medical Journal points out , that leads the antivivisectionists into some of their most remarkable aberrations , so that the preposterous yarns that have been spread throughout the United Kingdom , like the most effective pictures , nearly all relate to legendary canines . An amusing though typical case was brought up in the House of Commons recently when Mr. Ellis Griffith asked the Home . Secretary whether his attention had been called to a public experiment performed on a bull-dog by Doctor Waller . He described to the horror of his listeners how a leather strap with sharp nails was secured around the meek animal 's neck while his feet were immersed in glass jars containing salts in solution and the jars were connected by wires with galvanometers . Mr. Gladstone explained that this dreadful experiment consisted in making the dog stand for a time in water in which common salt had been added . " If , " continued the Home Secretary , " my honorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sensation . The animal ? a finely developed bull-dog ? was neither tied nor muzzled . He wore a leather collar ornamented with brass studs . Had the experiment been painful the pain no doubt would have been immediately felt by those near the dog . There was no sign of this . " Mr. Gladstone , therefore , did not take any action . ' This grotesque example ? and similar cases could be multiplied ? shows to what inhuman lengths such mis placed sentimentality can be carried . I say inhuman , for can a man claim a well-balanced mind and a normal // love of his species , who , in the face of the alarming spread of poverty , pauperism and physical deterioration that , British statesmen and sociologists alike admit and deplore , would attempt to ' irect the attention of the nation to the alleged discomfort of a robust , well-fed bull-dog ? " They are not to be laughed out of court , " says Collier 's ( l'ec%h y , " these crusaders in a mistaken cause , for their coutcution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fallacious . Intended to reduce the sum of animal suffering in the immediate sense , it ( the proposed New York State law ) would in t1w end immeasurably retard the work of alleviating hcinian pain and saving human lives . " And in another editorial : " No more weak and foolish agitation 1Las hccn started than this attack on medical progress for t he sake of Die poor defenceless dog . ' ' There is cnotigli wanton cruelty in this world , whether to arninaals , or to children , women and men . Let our sensational ncwsim1wrs , let . excited friends busy themselves wit.li the millions wlio are needlessly in pain and keep their hands off ' t laat profession which is doing most to lessen the suff'cring of this world . A law opposed by all competent doctors in the world is a foolish and harmful law to pass . " " They are queer people ? the antivivisectionists , " ? remarks the New York Times , editorially : " Unhappy victims of what Doctor Dana called the zoophil-neurosis , their love of animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sight of a child dying of diphtheria or spinal meningitis leaves them cold , but the killing of the chloroformed guinea-pig throws them into hysterics of indignation . " // But the antivivisectionists are not consistent even in their defence of animals . What do we hear of the bleed ing of calves to produce " white " veal ; of the rough and unsanitary castration of animals from which painful and unnecessary wounds often ensue ; what of the plucking of live fowls , the clipping of dogs ' ears , the branding of cattle , the fisherman 's amiable disregard of the struggling victims of his sport ? And how shall we explain the indifferent attitude of the antivivisectionists and other animal champions toward the slaughter of animals for food ? Surely if human health and life it-self must not weigh against the discomfort or prema ture death of a few small animals , no amount of mere gratification of the palate should sanction the ruthless slaughter of the millions of cattle , sheep and hogs which our modern civilization so complacently sanctions . ' I have mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of animal and bird life that passes muster under the name of sport ? Think of the countless birds and deer and fur-bearing animals that are ruthlessly killed and mutilated every year . Women who are really sincere in their love of animals do not need these feathers and fur trimmings on their hats . Epicures may desire venison , but they can get along without it . Then again , why do we not hear more about the ani100 MEDICAL CHAOS AND CRIME mal traps used by farmers and hunters ? Thousands ? hundreds of thousands ? of rabbits , ground hogs , minks , raccoons , skunks , etc. , are annually caught in these traps , and , as a rule , are forced to suffer for long periods before the trapper arrives to put them out of misery and appropriate the torn and bloody pelt . All this suffering , whether necessary or wholly preventable , inspires practically no murmur of disapproval ; the antiviviscctionist scarcely knows of its existence . But when a man of science , trained in the use of anmsthetics ( and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that get . the services of the expert in anansthesia ) , operates for the benefit of humanity on an insensible rabbit , a cry goes up that fairly rends the heavens . Listen to the sentiments of two leading crusaders upon the achievements of Pasteur : Mrs. Diana , Belais ( of New York ) in a recent pamphlet : " Pasteur and his followers increased a very rare disease called rabies , and are making fortunes out of the antirabic virus . " Which the Sun , slightly out of temper , styles " an infamous and malicious lie . " Mrs. Liza II . Badger , Secretary of the New York Anti-Vivisection Society , in a letter to the Sun , February 2 , 1909 : " I repeat that Pasteur was not only a murderer but a charlatan and a plagiarist , and we can prove it . . . . Boston , which ' knows it all , ' has an Avenue Pasteur . ' The world moves ! We may yet outdo Boston and have an Avenue ' Jack-the-Ripper ' in New York . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is a disgusting spectacle to see so great a benefactor as Pasteur treated in this frivolous manner by a parcel of unscrupulous women . " Before enumerating the results of vivisection , I must ' VIVISECTION ? STRAINING AT THE GNAT 101 concede that there are certain regrettable conditions which furnish ammunition to these belligerent extremists , and which a majority of the leading experimentalists , I am glad to say , regard as unjustifiable . One is the ordinary routine demonstration made in physiological laboratories merely for the purpose of showing to students the action of the heart , lungs , and so forth . I am unable to see where any great benefit results from such demonstrations , and there is the ever-present danger of arousing inhuman and perverted instincts in the spectators . Furthermore , I believe all reputable surgeons who encourage the practice among their students of operating upon anesthetized animals will welcome the day when medicine and surgery will have become , as abroad , two distinct professions . Then , of course , the embryo doctor will have no business in the class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mutilation of animals will have been abolished . But till that time arrives the system , not the surgeon or the pathological demonstrator , must be blamed , since the professor has no idea which of his students are eventually to become surgeons , and neither in many cases have the students themselves . Another condition I have in mind is where certain French and German psychologists have experimented on unanesthetized animals for the purpose of studying the emotions under torture . The results obtained from such sources may be , in many instances , highly interesting , but their practical application to human welfare and happiness is at present too abstract or indefinite to justify the means employed . Personally I should be glad to see these two classes of animal experimentation forbidden . // I regret to see that several eminent experimentalists in this country have been led into certain of these bypaths of science , among whom is Dr. George W. Crile of Cleveland . Now Dr. Crile is an authority on shock , and the study of shock is of inestimable value in the development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the better of his discretion when he performed the following experiment which he recently reported : " In a further effort to produce shock , the right hind paw was deeply burned . The left hind paw was burned . The right sciatic nerve was exposed , with some hemorrhage occurring during the operation . Peripheral and central traction was exerted and torsion , and the nerve was rubbed so much that it finally was rubbed through . The only effect was to increase the respira tory rate . " In any case he has managed to secure an immense amount of undesirable publicity , and has to that extent endangered the practice of the more essential and certainly less gruesome experiments upon animals that are carried on in the ordinary laboratory . Let us now hastily survey the actual , tangible results of animal vivisection that have come to medicine and surgery , and hence that , make for progress and the greater welfare of mankind . Cocaine as a local anaesthetic and in eye surgery is unrivalled . But it is a powerful and very dangerous drug in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals many human lives would have been lost before its properties would have been understood sufficiently to make its use at all reliable . Digitalis is one of our most valuable heart stimulants // and tonics . Doctor Scnn 's experiments are classic , and the thesis in which they were described won for him the degree of Doctor of Philosophy . Surgery of the intestines became possible to surgeons in general after the experiments of Parkes , Senn , and others , with animals . The spleen , stomach and gall-bladder have been removed when diseased or injured to an extent fatal to life had they been left in the body . Animal experimentation made this possible . Laparotomy , or opening the abdomen , thanks to animal experimentation , is now a recognized surgical procedure when an accurate diagnosis can not be made otherwise . Performed by a skilled surgeon the operation is only slightly dangerous in itself , while formerly the mortality from peritonitis made this one of the worst scourges of mankind . Sunstroke is now better understood and more lives can be saved as the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been one of the most fatal and dreaded of diseases . It is still dangerous , but since the discovery of anti-toxin by Behring and Roux the mortality has declined marvellously . Bubonic plague , the terror of the past , is to-day pretty well understood . Its mode of spreading by rats and fleas having been worked out by the exhaustive experiments of the British Plague Commission of India has made it possible to institute appropriate quarantine measures . Witness how the last plague invasion of San Francisco was stamped out . When experiment demonstrated that animals could live after removal of one kidney , it become possible to save the lives of many persons afflicted with tuberculosis // or other fatal diseases of one kidney by its total extirpation . Modern brain surgery is one of our most brilliant achievements . Many who would formerly have had to die of depressed fractures of the skull or brain tumors can now be saved because by experiments on the brains of living animals we have ascertained the principal functions of nearly every cubic inch of the brain tissue and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smallpox , formerly one of the most loathsome and fatal diseases , has dwindled into comparative insignificance . This is the direct result of vaccination , which is effected through animal agency . Hydrophobia used to occur in about sixteen per cent . of persons bitten by mad dogs . The mortality was one hundred per cent. , the disease being absolutely fatal . Since the employment of the Pasteur method the mortality in cases bitten has fallen from sixteen to less than one per cent . There is reason to hope that further experiments will finally result in a serum that will cure the disease after it has actually appeared . We seem to be on the eve of wonderful discoveries in regard to the cause and treatment of cancer . Animal experimentation has led us up to this point . If antivivisection laws are enacted the cancer work in this country will have to stop where it is , and the multitude of victims of this dreaded disease must abandon the hope that now makes their wretched lives barely tolerable . I could go on indefinitely in this vein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit resulting from animal experimentation , and that is to animals themselves . Formerly , in Europe , thousands of cattle and hogs were // carried off yearly by anthrax , swine plague , etc . Pasteur studied these diseases and discovered vaccination processes which protected the herds from these former scourges . For many years past the laws of Great Britain have practically prohibited vivisection . The result is that surgery in England is far behind surgery in other countries . When Lord Lister was engaged in the epochmaking series of experiments that gave to the world the knowledge that has made all of our great modern surgery possible , the short-sighted , sentimental laws of his own country obliged him to go to France to complete his work . In America , strenuous efforts are being made by illadvised persons and societies to have enacted antivivisection laws of a similar drastic character . Instead of confining themselves to the questionable experiments of faddists and perverts , and to the fruitless attempts of amateurs , usually students , to ape the ultra scientific achievements of such experimenters , they attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clamor for the practical annihilation of this supremely important branch of medical research . They confront the whole mass of scientific demonstration with the bold statement of some obscure practitioner , notoriety-loving " reformer , " or hysterical layman , and work on public sympathy by printing maudlin pictures , such as an old blind beggar being led about the streets by a dog , with the irrelevant legend , " A friend in need . " All of which is flimsy sophistry and sentimentality , and inspires nothing but contempt or amusement in those who know . For it must be fully understood that this agitation is intended to appeal to the ignorant and ill-informed . As // the agitators in England frankly avow " the movement must be democratized . " Democratized science ! If these ignorant meddlers succeed in having such antivivisection laws passed in the United States , it will be a matter of extreme regret on the part of the truly humane . Surgical progress will come to a standstill . Now we are in many respects in the lead , but in that event we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in time every other country in Europe , surpass us . Surely the antivivisectionist might find a nobler task than blindly to attack one of the most fruitful fields in all modern science . Concluding his memorable address delivered at the Massachusetts General Hospital , Boston , on the 63rd anniversary of Ether Day , October 16 , 1909 , Dr. Charles W. Eliot , President Emeritus of Harvard University , said : " If the educated public could only see clearly the immense benefits to mankind winch have already come and may reasonably lw expected to come in much larger amount from the experiments on animals which are necessary to the progress of medical research , if the public could only clearly realize the saving of human suffering and woe which has already resulted and is sure to result in still greater proportion from the sacrifice of a very limited amount of animal comfort and joy , the world would hear nothing more of objections to medical research . The most tender-hearted human being is ordinarily unable to fix a limit to the number of inferior animals he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now a baby is itself only a hope or a potentiality , its present power of enjoyment being extremely limited . What mother could fix a limit to the number of times a comfortable horse should be bled moderately , // or to the number of guinea pigs which should be sacrificed , in order to save her baby attacked by diphtheria ? The tender-hearted men and women who object to animal experimentation have no vision of the relief of human beings from agony and woe which has come out of animal experimentation . If they had any such vision , they would themselves manifest extraordinary cruelty and inhumanity in opposing medical research ; in their present blindness they attribute delight in inflicting suffering to the patient , far-seeing and far-hoping seekers for biological truth . Which is the truly humane and merciful man , the director of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research , who , by producing cerebrospinal meningitis in a few monkeys lately succeeded in providing men with a successful mode of treating that formidable disease , or the lawyer or newspaper writer who endeavored to prevent those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human race remain helpless on the occasional visitations of that heretofore fatal disease ? Humanity and mercy are conspicuously the attributes of medical research in the eyes of all people who can see what it has already done and what it promises to do . " In conclusion let it be remembered that the whole popular conception of animal vivisection is a gross exaggeration and distortion of the real facts . The word has become a misnomer and serves no other purpose than to call up distressing hallucinations and phantasms , and to influence public opinion against an imaginary evil . The antivivisectionist and his sympathizers are one and all straining at a gnat ? how willingly and uncomplainingly they swallow the camel , human vivisection , will be shown in the next chapter . CHAPTER VI VIVISECTION-SWALLOWING THE CAMEL " Oh , that men would stoop to learn , or at least cease to destroy ! " ? Stokes . " We regard those as surgeons , and those alone , who have , by conscientious devotion to the study of our science and the daily habitual discharge of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the practitioner serene , his judgment sound , and hands skilful , while it holds out to the patient rational hopes of amended health and prolonged life . " ? Dr. Valentine Mott . IT is sometimes necessary in making up one 's mind on an important issue to consider causes as well as resultant conditions . It is un-American , I admit , to grope around beneath the surface of things , and we generally come up gasping , yet the exercise is by no means harmful . Let me invite the reader to join me now in a brief excursion . The reason that animal vivisection is , on the whole , free from the abuses which an ill-informed but imaginative public have conjured up is that it is not a paying branch of medicine . Rabbits and cats do not pay to have their kidneys removed , nor do they testify to the marvellous manner in which they were rescued from the jaws of death . The man who patiently devotes years of his life to original research receives , at best , the meagre salary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a practising physician or surgeon he loses rather than gains by his devotion to science . Even honors are few and far between , so that his research is , in nine cases out of ten , a pure labor of love . Such unselfish devotion does not ordinarily foster inhumanity // on the contrary , these men , as a rule , are among the noblest in the profession , and deserve unstinted praise for their tolerant attitude toward their hysterical de-tractors . The practice of surgery , on the other hand , is becom ing lucrative . The fee charged for an operation on a wealthy patient is often enormous , and the most trifling ailment , if it calls for surgical intervention , costs the patient as much as weeks of treatment under a regular practitioner . Now far be it from me to underrate the services of the skilled surgeon , or to say that a man of means should not pay handsomely for a necessary operation . I sim ply desire to show how existing conditions must natur ally lead to unnecessary or fraudulent surgery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the hands of over-confident operators . There is no motive , except in the case of perverts , for the unnec essary mutilation of animals , but the doctor of ordinary ambition and easy conscience has every incentive to operate on his patient . In the first place , he gains prac tice thereby ; in the second place , he gets paid for his work ; and lastly , incredible as it may seem , whereas the mutilation or killing of animals brings disrepute , and is apt to be investigated by the public , the mutilation or killing of a human being ordinarily brings no disgrace , is not even investigated , and frequently means a sub stantial fee to the dishonest or incompetent operator . Here then lies the cause of the surgical outrages that I shall lay bare in this and the following chapters , ? our " rotten system . " ' HO MEDICAL CHAOS AND CRIME It Was Bernard Shaw , I believe , who brought down the wrath of British surgeons by remarking that when it was a question of earning sixty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temptation to a man who could do that by performing an operation to believe that an operation was necessary when it was not necessary . He did not think it was good public policy for any per-son to have a strong pecuniary interest in mutilating his fellows . " It is one thing to make an honest search for the truth , " writes Dr. G. H. Balleray ( of Paterson , New Jersey ) to the Medical Record , ' " in the interests of the patient , and quite another to play the charlatan while pretending t , o base one 's practice upon scientific accu racy . " Continuing , he says : " Wit.li some practitioners every belly ache is called appendicitis , and an operation for the removal of a normal appendix follows forthwith . The writer has seen the appendix removed in a number of cases in which it was absolutely normal , and within the past five years he has been consulted by many women who had been told that they should submit to an operation for what was said to be appendicitis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in most of the cases ; and in those in which abdominal section was neces sary it was found that the appendix had nothing to do with the symptoms complained of . In times gone by , when a physician was too indolent or too ignorant to make a diagnosis , he labelled the disease malaria , ' and reeking , and cries out for drastic reformation . " ? " Medical Edu cation , " in the Journal of the American Medical Association , April 17 , 1909. // everybody was satisfied . Now the so-called surgeon calls everything appendicitis , and cuts out the appen dix , with equally gratifying results . The furor for un necessary operations has spread to the laity , and the cheerfulness with which the would-be fashionable man parts with his appendix is only equalled by the abandon with which the modern woman submits to the eviscera tion of her pelvis by her pet gynecologist . Practising fantastic operations on the kidney keeps some men in the profession busy . A poor , thin , neurotic woman , whose circumrenal fat has been absorbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consults one of these men . With wonderful sagacity he diagnoses floating kidney ' and at once performs nephrorrha phy . If from rest in bed and general improvement in health therefrom a layer of fat is deposited around the kidney the woman is cured , and the doctor gives the credit to the operation . " Writing in the Journal of the American Medical As sociation upon " Conservatism in Surgery , " i Professor James E. Moore ( of Minneapolis ) has something to say on " radicalism " as well . To wit " If from a surgical standpoint we thus condemn the conservative for his sins of omission , how much more must we condemn the radical for his sins of commission ; for the former is not a surgeon in the common acceptance of the term , while the latter is classed as one because he is con stantly performing operations . The radical is one who believes that operations are the whole of surgery and that any one who can secure primary union of wounds most of the time is a surgeon . His existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it possible to in vade all parts of the body with impunity He often anlip . MEDICAL CHAOS AND CRIME nouners himself as a specialist in surgery without having had sullicient training to justify any such step , and too often secures patients by dividing fees with that class of practitioners who have a higher regard for their own pocketbooks than they have for the welfare of their patrons . Ile frequently performs unnecessary and even unwarrantable operations , and often when an operation is indicated fails to relieve the patient of his suffering because the surgeon 's ignorance and inexperience pre-vent him from recognizing pathologic conditions or from removing them when found . He classes every op eration from which the patient recovers as successful , regardless of whether any good has been accomplished or not . Every surgeon is consulted by a host of people who have been advised by the radicals to submit to all manner of operations for which there is no indication and for which very frequently positive contra-indica tions exist . The radical , for want of surgical training and experience , its it rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very apt to remove the stones from the gall bladder and leave those in the common duct . He removes the prominent part of a malignant growth , leaving the outlying parts and the neighboring lym phatic glands . The sins committed by the radical are legion . . . . " Perhaps the most absurd example of surgical sophis try was communicated to the American Journal of Clin ical Medicine ' by it distinguished Chicago physician . " On my recent trip to , " he writes , " I learned from a young surgeon of that city that pus might form in the body without , rigor , elevation of temperature , exudation , induration , swelling or discoloration ; and that this was especially true in appendicitis ? pain localSWALLOWING // ized being the only symptom , and that this warranted an immediate operation . " The editor comments as follows : " It seems presumptuous in an obscure individual like the writer to offer advice to the modern surgeon , but really we think the suggestion worthy of his serious consideration . In days of old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uterus , some worthy men in the front rank of the profession were nonplussed by failing to detect any ulcer in cases that really should have shown it to verify their theories . They , therefore , assumed that in such cases the terrible malady was there even when it was n't ? in other words that it was latent . ' Now , why not have a latent appendicitis ? " I know a New York doctor , supposed to be a specialist ? and still so considered by many ? who was anxious to do a Kraske operation . He had never done one , but he had heard of the operation and was absolutely determined to avail himself of the first chance to perform it . In walked a poor old man , one day , eighty years of age , with senile debility and slight hemorrhoids , who complained of some pain along the lower part of the spine . The doctor , of course , saw a good chance to operate . Was this man of ninety suffering from cancer ? The specialist thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately . The operation was an entire success . The poor old man died fifteen minutes after he had been put on the table , but the surgeon finished the operation and hadthe patient put to bed . He told the family not to disturb the old gentleman as the shock was sometimes severe , that if they came in the morning he was sure he would have a good report for them . The family came early // enough , - for they were sent for in a hurry at a quarter to two . When they arrived at the hospital the sad news was broken that the patient had just passed away . They were not allowed to go into the room , however , for fear of detecting the temperature of the body . The undertaker took charge of the remains . The family to-day are entirely satisfied with this surgeon 's work . The tissues removed showed no evidence of cancer and the operation was unnecessary , but the family do not know that . The result of course was unintentional , but to advise operation under such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " being slightly discouraged by his Kraske operation , thought he would turn his at tention to prostatectomy , which at times is decidedly difficult . The net person who placed himself at his mercy wits it mutt forty-eight years of age , and per fectly healthy . IIowever , the surgeon discovered that he had an enlarged prostate gland , and nothing must do but to gouge it out . The family consented and so did the patient . IIe also was the unfortunate victim of surgical zeal . Tlic prostate was taken out , but the results were not satisfactory and death occurred four days later . I could give many cases similar to these , in some of which the technique was perfect , but the operation un necessary or the patient unfitted to undergo it . " The temptation to do it complete and perfect operation is very great , " says the editor of the American Journal of Surgery . ' " A successful operation is often done , but the patient dies . " Addressing the City and County Medical Society of Portland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // R. C. Coffey told of an acquaintance of his who operated on twenty cases of appendicitis with eighteen deaths , and cited an instance from Dennis of nineteen cases with nineteen deaths . ' " These men , " says Doctor Coffey , " instruct the peo ple that appendicitis means certain death unless imme diate operation is resorted to . They thus distort the other and radical side of the subject , and bring dis credit on the profession , for it is well known that not more than fifteen per cent . die , if left without treat ment of any kind . " Treated medicinally , Doctor Coffey might have added , the mortality would be less than one per cent . that is , if the report of the French Army hospitals can be believed . Of course , the cases just cited are exceptional , as even the average surgeon of the old school would have no such mortality ; but the public hears so much from the surgeons ( indirectly , of course ) of their successful cases , that it is well to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( of New York ) evidently thought the same when he prepared his address to the Harlem Medical Society last year . " It is a common thing , " 2 the address begins , " in these days of highly perfected surgical technique to report a large number of satis factorily operated cases , and to present the specimens derived therefrom . I make no comment upon this pro cedure . It serves a laudable ambition and a laudable purpose . But it has seemed to me that it might not be amiss , for once , to present for consideration some of the accidents " etc. // Doctor Brickner deserves great praise for his temerity , and with such excellent precedent I shall proceed to give a few more cases of unsuccessful operations , which , by some strange oversight , have not been recorded among the brilliant achievements of modern surgery . First , however , let us consider what are the factors , apart from diagnostic judgment and operative skill , that make for success in surgery . The greatest discovery in surgery since the employment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be described as absolute cleanness . The surgeon 's hands , and that part of the patient 's body which is to be operated on , must be made scrupulously clean by the use of soap and water and scrubbing brushes , followed by one or more antiseptic solutions . The instruments and dressings have to be sterilized by boiling , or by steam or chemical solutions . Every modern surgeon knows that the observance of these precautions usually results in a clean wound , which heals quickly without pain or suppuration . Negligence of surgical cleanlMess , on the other hand , invariably results in a dirty wound , painful , suppurating , foul , and dangerous both to the life of the patient and to the success of the operation . The training in a modern operating room of a large hospital is such that surgeons and nurses perform their work in a cleanly manner almost by instinct . It is , therefore , a recognized principle that cleanliness is essential in operating and in the dressing of wounds , and surgeons who operate with dirty hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of modern surgery . Dirty or careless surgeons fall into two classes : // Those who wilfully neglect their duty , and those who graduated before antisepsis was taught and conse-quently do not know any better . Now it is well known in law that ignorance can not be pleaded as an excuse for crime or misdemeanor , so that in both cases , the modern surgeons who know , and the older ones who do not , surgical uncleanliness is malpractice in every sense of the word ? in the former , wilful or criminal mal-practice . Should the merely ignorant surgeon , therefore , be excused because of his ignorance ? I think not . This type is ordinarily a man of venerable appearance em-phasized by a long gray beard , a relic of an earlier and ( surgically ) barbarous age . He might read up the progress of surgical science if he cared to , but he does not . Protected by inefficient laws , he roams about in senile complacency , dispensing incalculable suffering , deformity and death . When an unprogressive operator of this description @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter , as also the nurse , is fully aware of the blunders which are about to be committed . But professional etiquette forbids them to inform the victim , or the family , of the butchery they are to witness , to the shame and disgrace of true surgery that has to suffer for , and shelter , these gross incompetents . I am now referring to recognized surgeons , not to old practitioners who turn to surgery as a last resort . The latter , despite a lifelong experi-ence in medicine , must be regarded as surgical novices and will be considered elsewhere as such . Surgeon M. , U. S. i1. , retired , was for many years a prominent physician and surgeon in one of our sea-port cities . Thirty years ago , in the days of dirty // hands , wooden-handled instruments and " laudable pus , " lie had been regarded as a skilful operator . But , although , as we have seen , what was surgery then is butchery now , Doctor M. saw no reason for modernizing his antiquated methods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boast : " You fellows wash your hands before operating , but I wash mine afterwards . " All this was entre noes , of course , but even had it been otherwise it would have had little effect on his large practice , both civil and military , since he had the ( to the laity ) obvious advantage of age , whiskers ? probably dashed with tubercular sputum , for the doctor was a consumptive ? and a full surgeon 's shoulder straps . To illustrate Doctor M. 's methods , I will narrate a laparotomy ( opening of the abdomen ) that he performed upon it fine , athletic young man suffering from a second allack of appendicitis . It was what is called a " clean " case , that is , one in which the vermiform appendix was in It state of catarrhal inflammation without pus formation or abscess . When the assistants and nurses had prepared the patient for operating , mud had got their hands and instruments , and everything else , in a state of the most scrupulous surgical asepsis , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands in his pockets and a disdainful smile on his face as his eye took in the usual careful preparations . He refused to have his hair and whiskers bound about with a strip of gauze , its all others in the room had done , but as a concession to the head nurse ( for whom he entertained a fatherly regard ) , be dipped his hands perfunctorily into it basin of antiseptic solution , without , however , cleaning the // long , dirty finger-nails . He then donned a smock , took up an old-fashioned wooden-handled knife , and was ready for business . In order to make what follows quite clear to the reader , it should be stated that the muscles of the ab-domen are in three layers , and that the fibres of each run at a different angle , which gives a lattice work or grid-iron effect . This is Nature 's arrangement to secure the greatest possible strength in the abdominal wall . The modern operation for appendicitis , devised by Doc-tor McBurney of New York , aims to preserve this struc-tural strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same plane , as was formerly done . The McBurney method did not appeal to Doctor M. , however , who cut his way , with a saw-ing movement , right through everything down to the peritoneum , the membrane immediately covering the in-testines . The younger surgeons present shuddered at this needless mutilation , but " medical ethics " and of-ficial respect closed their mouths . When the peritoneum was opened and the intestines exposed , the venerable sur-geon laid down his knife , pulled his smock to one side , put his bloody hand into his hip pocket and drew forth a plug of tobacco . He bit of a piece , then offered the plug to the others , who declined the honor . As he re-placed the tobacco in his pocket a nurse hastened for- ward with a basin of antiseptic solution . There - was a moment of breathless expectancy . Would he wash his hands before plunging them into the patient 's ab-domen ? The doctor readjusted his spectacles , waved the girl back to her station , inserted his contaminated fingers into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The enormity of such an action // can not be fully appreciated except by surgeons and trained nurses , but its mere crudity ought , I believe , to appeal more or less to every reader . Had the incision revealed an abscess , the doctor 's omission to wash his hands would not have been so serious , though entirely inexcusable as a technical blunder , but to shove dirty fingers into a clean abdomen means deliberately to expose the patient to the danger of fatal peritonitis . The old surgeon had had plenty of experience , and so he soon found the appendix and drew it to the surface . IIe cut through its mesenteric attachments without tying the bleeding vessels , and then severed the appendix itself , without making the slightest attempt to prevent the intestinal contents from escaping into the peritoneal cavity . When he had tied the stump of the appendix , he pushed it back into the abdomen along with its still bleeding and unsecured vessels . The doctor now scratched his head with his bloody hand . Then he closed the abdominal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through all the layers . By the way , modern surgeons invariably sew up each muscular layer separately , so as to make a stronger wall and to prevent a rupture forming afterwards . A dressing of vaseline completed this barbarous and antiquated butchery , called by courtesy a surgical operation . , ee As might have been expected , the results were bad . The patient 's great vitality ( or an interposition of Providence ) prevented general peritonitis , but he nearly died from concealed hemorrhage owing to the untied blood vessels , which twelve hours later necessitated reopening the wound , after which the wire sutures cut badly and had to be removed . The patient made a long , lingering recovery after several weeks of misery , // whereas a modern , clean operation would have put him on his feet in seven days . Several months later a hernia ( rupture ) formed in the scar , which was subsequently operated on and cured by another surgeon . This eminent surgeon died recently and was buried with military honors . After the funeral , his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was heard to remark : " We 're all sorry the old doctor 's dead , of course , but we 'll have to admit that his death is a godsend to his patients . " Now , while I do not wish the reader to understand that Doctor M. was typical of the surgeon of advanced years , neither do I regard his methods as at all exceptional . Indeed it is safe to say that there are thousands of surgeons still practising such antiquated methods , and bringing shame and discredit upon the profession . I can not dismiss this phase of the subject without again referring to that abomination of the operating room ? a beard . The object of surgical cleanliness is to get rid of all dust and foreign matter , for these substances harbor the microscopic germs of disease . For this reason , the entire operating force generally wear cloths about the heads to prevent the introduction of dandruff and dust from the head into the wound . But where is there a greater catch-all for dust , particles of food , dried soup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the beard ? Dr. Nicholas Senn said : " No surgeon should wear a beard ; a modest mustache is all he can permit himself . " And not only is a beard objectionable as a dust sprinkler , but supposing the men wearing them are near-sighted and have to bring the face close to the wound ? the // beard then actually gets into the wound . I have seen this disgusting and lamentable accident several times , and invariably followed by pus infection . Doctor Q. , of New York , enjoys an excellent reputation as a surgeon , and his practice therefore is large and lucrative . It would seem that formerly he was a better operator than now ; to-day he is certainly a menace to the community , and I have heard that several prominent surgeons are considering the propriety of exposing him as both irresponsible and dangerous . His deterioration has been ascribed to a drug habit , and this , if true , would readily explain it . Doctor Q. recently operated , in a private hospital , on a simple case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on account of the large number of veins to be attended to . After about two hours of work , and the end still far away , he became hungry and ordered a lunch prepared and served . When it was ready he suspended the operation and took a leisurely meal . During this pause for refreshments the patient was kept continuously under the influence of ether . When the surgeon 's hunger was appeased , he washed his hands ( I believe ) and went ahead with the operation . This , of course , was an instance of flagrant malpractice ? to interrupt a surgical operation under anaesthesia for any but the most urgent cause ? and I have specially selected the case for the consideration of those antivivisectionists who are concerned about the scientific anaesthetizing of cats and dogs . To prolong anaesthesia unnecessarily is in direct violation of one of the main principles of modern surgery , yet it is only too frequently allowed by careless or selfish surgeons . Doctor Q. 's operation lengthened out to four hours , and SWALLOWING THE CAMEL 12S might easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to endure the strain , and , I am told , recovered in time . In view of the foregoing it will hardly surprise the reader to learn that Doctor Q. is careless and dirty in his surgical technique . The result is that most of his cases become infected with pus , which has earned for him the unenviable sobriquet of " Doctor Pus " at a certain hospital where he operates . One of the nurses employed at that institution said to me lately : " Nearly all of his clean cases are pus cases in the end , and the strange thing is that he never removes the dressings to see if the wounds are suppurating until you can smell the patients in the hallways . " Doctor K. is a well-known physician and surgeon in a Western seaport , and has a large practice . He graduated less than twenty years ago , and should therefore be reasonably modern in his surgical technique . But he does not keep up with the progress of science , and employs obsolete methods in hernia and other surgical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to re-cleanse his hands after having handled unsterilized objects in the room , and he greatly resents having his attention called to such omissions , even though there is time to correct them . One of his fatal cases , now to be recorded for the first time , was Mrs. G. , a well-to-do woman of about sixty years of age , who had been complaining for some time of pains in the stomach and chronic indigestion . There was occasional vomiting , loss of general health and weight , and some tenderness on pressure over the upper abdomen , especially toward the right side . She had never vomited blood , which is nearly always present in // serious conditions like ulcer or cancer of the stomach , but , considering her age and symptoms , and the fact that I ) r . K. believed he was able to feel an abnormal mass under the left lobe of the liver and near the outlet of the stomach , the case did suggest cancer , though it was by no means typical . Dr. K. advised opening the abdoinen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had also seen the case did not approve of an operation at that time , believing that the symptoms were not sufficiently definite , nor the patient 's condition vigorous enough to expose her to the shock of laparotomy . Doctor K. 's counsels prevailed , however , and the lady went to the operating table . Now Doctor K. is a very slow operator , and , as stated above , not sufficiently careful as to surgical cleanliness . In this instance , however , he planned to dazzle his assistant and the surgeon just referred to by an elaborate and original mancnuvre in the department of asepsis . Before making his incision through the skin he buried the umbilicus ( navel ) by sewing the surrounding skin over it . A more futile and absurd proceeding can hardly be imagined , especially as the doctor did not wear the modern operating gloves , and his finger nails were not particularly clean . This preliminary detail consumed more time than should ordinarily have been used in opening the abdomen and exposing the stomach . In cases like this , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient . When the stomach was at last exposed , no abnormal swelling or tumor could be found . The organ itself was somewhat dilated , but that was about all . Doctor K. felt the pylorus ( the outlet ) , which was normally surrounded by a thick and firm ring of muscular tissue , // and insisted that this was an abnormal swelling and the first stage of cancer . He insisted further that the cancerous condition encroached on the lumen of the outlet , obstructing the discharge of food from the stomach , thus accounting for the pain and vomiting . Much more time was now lost in arguing whether or not cancer existed , though for some reason he did not demonstrate the presence or absence of obstruction as he might have done by means of a very simple test . All this time the patient was growing weaker and responding poorly to stimulants . Having convinced himself of the correctness of his diagnosis , Doctor K. was much inclined to attempt a resection , or cutting out , of the supposed cancerous parts of the stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him considerable time , so he abandoned the idea . The stomach , therefore , was put back where it belonged , the abdomen was sewed up , a dressing applied , and the patient removed from the operating room and put to bed . The operation took nearly two hours and the consequent shock was so great that the patient never rallied as she should have done . On the contrary , she gradually grew weaker , and on the fourth day died . Here we have an example of a blundering and worse than useless operation . The abdomen was opened , the stomach and other organs were handled and exposed to danger from pus infection , but absolutely nothing else was done to them , nor did they need it . The whole affair was a combination of hasty diagnosis and a desire to perform laparotomy on a patient able to pay a good fee . I shall give another lamentable case of Doctor K. 's , // illustrating his criminal carelessness . Like that of Mrs. G. , it has so far been omitted from his published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , went to him complaining of a pain in the abdomen , which Doctor K. diagnosed as appendixitis . He accordingly opened the abdomen , in his none too cleanly manner , and found the appendix to be inflamed as he had surmised . After inserting several gauze pads , which is usually done to prevent the intestinal contents from getting into the peritoneal cavity and causing blood-poisoning , he proceeded to remove the appendix , and then , just for luck , the right ovary also . When ready to close the wound he pulled out , as he supposed , all the gauze pads , and then sewed up the various membranes . Mrs. J. made a fairly rapid recovery , everything considered . She went back to her work sooner than was advisable , but then Doctor K. 's fee was high , and she was in straitened circumstances . Very soon , however , she began to experience abdominal pains again , which gradually grew worse until the poor woman could scarcely drag herself to and from her work . When she could endure it no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptoms and told her she had stomach trouble , for which he prescribed appropriate remedies . She paid for the advice and the prescriptions , but the medicine did her no good . Soon she began to develop a low fever and had to visit the doctor almost daily . All her scant earnings now went into his pocket , and she had to borrow money for further treatment . Meanwhile Doctor K. became somewhat puzzled over the case , which he realized was not stomach trouble . He began to regret that he had not removed the other // ovary . At last , however , the patient could work no longer , and as she had clearly reached the end of her resources he lost interest in her and discontinued his treatment . About a month later some charitable ladies who had formerly employed her sent Mrs. J. to a private hospital and engaged Doctor C. , a first-class , up-to-date young surgeon , to take charge of the case . He made a careful examination and found an abnormal swelling or bulging in the vagina just back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep , pelvic abscess and advised immediate operation . The consent given , Doctor C. had the patient prepared , anoesthetized , and brought to the operating table . His intention was first to make an exploratory incision into the swelling , and then , if this did not reach the abscess , to perform another operation . The first proved to be all that was needed . As the knife pierced the swelling a quantity of foul pus escaped . Passing his rubber-gloved fingers into the abscess cavity to ascertain its depth and direction , Doctor C. encountered a large semi-solid mass lying posteriorily . He was puzzled for a moment only , for to his experienced touch , the feeling of the mass against his finger was not new , though happily rare . It meant only one thing . Keeping his finger on the mass , he took a long dressing forceps in his other hand , guiding them carefully with his other fingers , and then slowly drew out a large , blood-soaked , stinking wad of surgical gauze . " Medical ethics , " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ K. 's egregious blunder , but he did inform him privately of the circumstance . // Doctor Ii. , however , was far from grateful , although Doctor C. had discovered and rectified his blunder , and protected his reputation ; in fact , he became his secret enemy . I discovered a similar blunder a few years ago when a poor , emaciated girl came to my ward in a New York hospital . This young woman , also , had been operated on for appendicitis , but the wound had never healed , and so she had undergone a second operation for supposed abscess of pelvic origin . The second operation failed to relieve her , and on carefully examining her I decided to make a third . After making a small incision posterior to the uterus through the vaginal wall , I noticed that there was something quite out of the ordinary . I inserted a finger and to my surprise felt gauze , and presently pulled out of the abdomen through the vagina a large abdominal gauze pad . The girl made an uneven ) ful recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remove one of his pads . Still another similar case that came to my notice , but one that ended more disastrously , occurred in Washington , D. C. A young married woman suffering from irregular hemorrhages was told that a thorough scraping of the uterus would cure her , and so she submitted to this operation . The surgeon , finding that he had troublesome bleeding to deal with , decided to pack the large and boggy uterus with gauze . This he did , and he also packed the vagina . Twenty-four hours afterward he ordered the nurse to remove the gauze , and the latter , carelessly , or in ignorance , removed the vaginal packing only . When the uterus had remained packed for three months , the suffering patient conSWALLOWING // suited an " expert . " After due examination this specialist found that the uterus was abnormally large and hard , and decided that it was affected with " fibroid " and should be removed . So he performed a hysterectomy , only to find that he had removed a normal uterus filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between then , had carelessly overlooked . An even worse case than the foregoing was that of Miss Donovan of Philadelphia , who died last year after eleven years of suffering , the victim of another surgeon 's criminal carelessness . I will quote the account given in the N. Y. Swn of January 23 , 1910 , which is substantially correct : " Philadelphia , Jan. 22 . ? After living for eleven years with a pair of forceps in her abdomen , Miss Mary Donovan died last Wednesday , following an operation performed to remove the instrument . " Miss Donovan scoured the world in search of health following the first operation . At intervals she was seized by severe pains and medical experts failed to give relief . " At the request of a specialist who was summoned to the home of the young woman to attend her , an X-ray photograph was made . The forceps was discovered and an operation ordered . " Dr. John G. Clark of the University Hospital was summoned and the operation was attempted . The patient could not stand the shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and good surgeons , too , often overlook a gauze pad , a sponge , or even one or more instruments when closing a wound , the reader is no doubt aware ? how frequently this deplorable blunder has happened , however , will never be known either within or without the profession . Many surgeons , moreover , ad130 MEDICAL CHAOS AND CRIME mitting the terrible mortality among such victims of carelessness , nevertheless regard the accident as one that is bound to occur . " So long as surgery continues an art , " writes Schachuer , " just so long will foreign bodies continue to be unintentionally left in the abdom inal cavity . " Truly a pessimistic outlook . Dr. H. S. Crossen ( of St. Louis ) gives , at the close of a paper on this subject , ' a table containing no less than two hundred and forty cases of a foreign body lost in the abdominal cavity . Commenting on his statistics , he says : " The table includes only cases in which the abdominal cavity was involved . A number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation were excluded because the operation involved the breast , neck , hip , etc. , instead of the abdominal cavity . Other cases were excluded because the sponge or forceps was found before the abdomen was closed . Other cases were ex cluded because they were probably or possibly repeats . " No particular effort was made to secure a large number of cases to ( late , by a prolonged search of lit erature nor by writing to surgeons for a list of personal cases . A few recorded cases , more or less , make little difference , for these recorded cases represent only a small proportion of the total number of such accidents . ' " Abdominal Surgery Without Detached Pads or Sponges . " Read at the 21st Annual Meeting of the American Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists , at Baltimore , September , 1908 , and published in the American Journal of Obstetrics , January and February , 1909. // My object , therefore , is not so much to present a long list as to present a quick survey of authenticated cases of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pause and think on this matter . " A sponge is the article most frequently left in the peritoneal cavity , but in about one-fourth of the recorded cases the article left was a forceps or piece of an instrument or other small object used about the wound . This calls attention forcibly to the fact that small instruments should not be allowed about an open abdominal wound . Neugebauer long ago called attention to this danger of small instruments , and urged the use of long instruments exclusively in abdominal work . " As a matter of fact this terrible sacrifice of life and health is no longer excusable , for several leading surgeons have attacked the problem with the conviction that it can , and the determination that it must be solved . And so we have the check system , whereby only a certain number of pads are laid on the operating table , every one of which must be accounted for , as well as every instrument , before the wound is closed . Even better than this , so far as the pads are concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper from which I have just quoted , which eliminates detached pads and sponges entirely , the gauze being used in long strips , one end of which is fastened to the sterile sheet . Either of these two methods , preferably the latter , with the use of long instruments , will practically guarantee the patient 's safety from this horrible danger ? that is , with competent and conscientious surgeons . But so long as the profession enjoys its present irresponsibility , the old , haphazard methods will probably remain in general favor , with torture or death in store for many a luckless patient . CHAPTER VII MORE SURGICAL OUTRAGES " There is something absurd , and unworthy of the high standing of our profession , in performing any operation , however slight , which is useless ; but it is a revolting thought to perform one that is worse than useless , viz. : injurious . " ? Dr. Abraham Jacobi . " The task before me is a serious criticism of what is going on in every community . I do not single out any community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt whatever that surgery is being practised by those who are incompetent to practise it ? by those whose education is imperfect , who lack natural aptitude , whose environment is such that they never can gain that personal experience which alone will really fit them for what surgery means to-day . They are unable to make correct deductions from histories ; to predict probable events ; to perform operations skilfully , or to manage after-treatment " ? Dr. Maurice H. Richardson . In one respect , at least , the town or country patient enjoys an advantage over his fellow-sufferers in the large cities , and it is this : that a country surgeon is forever meeting the victims of his carelessness or incompetence ? provided they live ? whereas a surgeon in a large city is practically never confronted with the evidence of his mistakes . This unquestionably tends to equalize things , for if the latter possesses greater skill and experience , the former has much stronger cause to fear the results of his blunders . As an outspoken surgeon writes : " To those of us who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we meet on the streets some of the living monuments of the pleasing and displeasing // results of our efforts , our successes or failures , these questions ( the after-results of mastoid operations ) be-come of more than passing interest . " 1 Particularly is this true of amputations , which are in many respects one of the greatest reproaches to modern surgery . The time was when to attempt to save a limb , severely shattered or lacerated , was to subject the patient to the risk of almost certain death , whereas to-day , to amputate in-stantly , except in a case of hopeless mutilation , is a sign of criminal indifference on the part of the operator . Yet in our cities , where the busy surgeon has more cases than he can handle , or in the hospitals , where the ambitious interns have a multitude of helpless folks at their mercy to operate on as they please , amputations are constantly being performed where care and judicious treatment would unquestionably lead to the recovery and lifelong use of the limb so recklessly sacrificed . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Temple College , and Surgeon-in-Chief to the Samaritan Hospital , Philadelphia , in a paper read at the North-west Branch of the Philadel-phia County Medical Society , March 7 , 1907,2 reported the following scandalous condition in his own hospital : " A few years since there was an understanding in the service of the Samaritan Hospital that all amputa-tions below the wrist were to be placed in charge of the resident physician , and as a result there soon arose quite a competition between members of the resident staff as to who should have , during the service , the largest // number of such amputations . We were amazed to find that amputations of the fingers constituted one of the most common of operations in the dispensary service , and at times several fingers were amputated in a single week . A rule was therefore enforced that no general aniesthetic should be given , and that no amputation be done , except . under the direction of the attending sur geon or his qualified assistant . Although the dispensary service was progressively increased as to the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand has become very infrequent . " Writing upon " Unnecessary Amputations , " Dr. W. Louis Ila rllimn ( of Syracuse , New York ) 1 gives several instances of patients saved from needless mutilation by his determined ) opposition to immediate amputation . He says : " One can just as well amputate some hours or days after injury as at once , and this without menace to the patient , and on the other hand save many members which are unnecessarily sacrificed . I understand it is much less trouble to take care of an amputation than of a fracture , but this must not stand in the way of duty . I do not know of any problem in surgery where good judgment and conservatism should prevail more than on this question , when to amputate and when not . I do not think interims in hospitals should ever be allowed to amputate without the counsel of the surgeon , as they are very often too eager to operate and their experience has at this time been insufficiently ripened to have the good sound judgment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reader 's time to give in-stances of needless sacrifice of an arm or a leg ? at least // a third of the cripples one meets are cases in point , and several authorities would probably place the percentage much higher . Many of these poor creatures , however , lost their limbs before the present perfection of asepsis and so no blame can be laid to surgery which did well , a generation ago , to save the patient 's life . But the average amputation of to-day , such as the case given in the succeeding chapter , where a woman sacrificed her arm to gratify a youthful surgeon 's ambition , is un doubtedly ill-advised , a gruesome testimony to our crim inal incompetence . In this connection I wish to present some remarkable examples of the result of care and skill in preventing mutilation . These are selected from a number of cases reported by Dr. John Egerton Cannaday , Surgeon-in charge Sheltering Arms Hospital , Hansford , West Vir ginia , ' who is an eloquent advocate of conservative surgery . " Case 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to me by Dr. C. N. Watts , Dothan , W. Va . " History. ? The man had been shot in the left leg at about the junction of the upper and middle thirds by a Winchester rifle ; the ball struck the tibia squarely and produced a badly comminuted fracture . An occlusive dressing was applied and the man kept in his shanty in a railroad camp with the hope that healing would take place . After six weeks of this , suppuration not only of the wound but of the entire leg below the knee had become so general that amputation was considered to be the only means of saving the man 's life . At the time the patient came to the hospital he had severe chills , // fever and sweats , but I decided to make an attempt to save the leg . " Operation. ? Under general anaesthesia the wound was opened , cleansed and several fragments of dead bone removed ; four long pus cavities were opened freely , irrigated and drained . These cavities lay in general in the direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original wound . One of them extended some distance above the knee joint into the thigh . Neither the ankle nor knee joints were involved . Under frequent dressings and irrigations some improvement of the leg was manifested , but during the next three months the patient had to be twice anaesthetized and new sinuses opened . " Result . - At . the end of the tenth week after admission to the hospital , the sixteenth week after the receipt of the injury , there was bony union and the patient was put on crutches . In a month he was walking in a limping 1innner , but the original bullet wound had not yet closed . The leg was painful when much used . Two subsequent operations had to be done for the removal of carious hne . These cavities finally filled and at the end of the tenth month of hospital residence he left well , with a st r ; uigHt , sound leg , capable of earning his own living and not likely to become a public charge . " " Case 3.  --  -P ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employee . " History. ? Patient fell so that his left arm came in contact with a rapidly revolving circular saw . Two and one-half inches below the elbow the forearm was more than two-thirds sawn in two . The radius was cut entirely in two and the articulate end of the ulna was torn completely out of the elbow joint and projected backward past the angle of the elbow for at least two inches . He was brought to the hospital about three hours after being injured and was operated on soon afterward. // " Operation. ? The wound was irrigated with saline solution , the fractured ends of the radius were wired , and the elbow luxation was reduced . The wound was closed with the exception of a small drainage opening , and the arm immobilized in a right-angled splint . Healing was primary , and passive motion was begun at the end of the second week . Results were perfect and the man now has a normal arm with no elbow ankylosis whatever . " " Case 4 . ? G. H. W. , Olcott , W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tompkins , Charleston , W. Va . " History. ? This man had been severely struck on the left elbow in an accident . The arm was terribly swollen , crepitation in the region of the elbow joint could be made out and not much else . " Operation. ? I made an incision lateral to the joint and found that the component bony parts of the joint had been crushed . I resected the broken end of the ulna , also the articulate head of the humerus , which was fractured entirely across its diameter . Through and through drainage was maintained for a time . A useful arm capable of considerable range of motion was the result . " It is a pleasure to cite such examples of well-directed conservatism , but I do not wish to be understood to say that surgical outrages are all on the operative side . The instances of lifelong misery and death from timidity on the part of the physician or of ultra-conservatism on the part of the surgeon are legion , and this applies to appendicitis , and even to amputations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intestinal obstruction , " remarks Dr. Henry B. Luhn ( of Spokane , Washington ) , " operation is often withheld until the diagnosis is written all over the belly , which is a fatal delay . " // Writing upon this phase of the subject Dr. Q. W. Hunter ( of Louisville , Kentucky ) i says " It can be amply demonstrated that in surgical prac tice ultra-conservatism is an exceedingly dangerous in stitution when indiscriminately applied , and under no circumstances does the truth of this statement become more apparent than in a certain percentage of instances in which amputation of extremities becomes imperative as a life-saving measure , or because of extensive crush ing injuries . Per contra , however , the fact must not be permitted to pass unobserved that it is in this de partment of surgical practice some of the most brilliant results have been achieved by strict adherence to con servative principles . " In the preceding chapter I gave a number of shocking examples of bad surgery as performed by surgeons of the old school or by careless or inexpert operators . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mis leading to the public , were I to omit the mistakes and catastrophes of the higher men in the profession . Here it is hard to say just what measure of blame to appor tion . All men in all professions make mistakes at times , even with the greatest care and devotion to duty . But some great surgeons , notwithstanding their brilliant achievements , are notoriously careless and indifferent to the lives of their patients . The following cases are in-stances of such carelessness ; otherwise I would not have recorded them . I was once invited to a surgical clinic held by one of // the most noted surgeons in New York City . Expecting to see something out of the ordinary I attended , and certainly was not disappointed . A. woman was to be operated on for some kidney trouble , and the surgeon , after a lengthy discussion of the case before a number of physicians , stated that he would not operate if he were not sure that the diagnosis he had made was correct . ' he operation was performed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised the surgeon , and turning to the house surgeon he inquired for the history chart . After looking it over he exclaimed : " Who prepared this patient ? I thought you told me it was the left kidney ! " There was an awkward silence for a few seconds , whereupon the humiliated surgeon , recovering his self-possession , put back the left kidney and sewed the woman up . Then he had her right side sterilized , and operated upon the other kidney . If this blunder was not the surgeon 's fault , it was unquestionably his duty to see that the offender was found and punished . After the operation the patient 's condition was serious . She lived , however , and an apparently satisfactory explanation followed as to why they had operated on both kidneys . The following case occurred in the practice of a wellknown New York surgeon : The patient was a young girl of about fifteen , the daughter of a wealthy family . One day she was taken ill with appendicitis and the surgeon in question was called in. ple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the family was obtained and the operation duly performed . The patient made an uneventful recovery .
