 |p470  DOWN to our own time patriotism has been revered as the noblest passion a man can cherish in his capacity as subject or as citizen . Loyalty to the head of the family , in patriarchal days ; later , devotion to clan and tribe and sovereign ; and finally , duty to state and nation ? these have been the successive stages of patriotism . " Sweet is it and becoming to die for one 's country , " sang Horace . " Our country , right or wrong ! " exclaimed Decatur . And every government lives on the assumption that , in any emergency , it can count on the patriotism of its inhabitants . This sentiment which , under normal conditions , gives buoyancy to all and several , becomes a persecuting desire to people that have lost their independence or been shut out from their country . To the Italians of the nineteenth century , oppressed by foreign and native despots , who deprived them not of freedom only but of even the semblance of national unity , patriotism took the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrors of life ; it fortified them for the scaffold ; it enabled them , after fifty years of struggle , to overcome . And through all this ordeal they had Dante as their companion . Many of them consciously sought his guidance ; many more were influenced by him unawares . We may well inquire , therefore , What were Dante 's own qualifications as a patriot ? Could he teach by example , or only , after the manner of most political philosophers , by precept ? Born a Florentine , at the moment when Florence was passing through a crisis in her history , his whole life was spent amid political turmoil , which distracted not alone Florence  |p471  and Tuscany , but every Italian community . Whoever peers for the first time into the welter of that epoch , sees only the aimless churning and rush and insensate fury of a whirlpool . Little by little , however , you begin to discern a general purpose in that chaos of wrath . You note whence the torrents pour themselves into the boiling caldron ; you note also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away ; and as you look longer , you discover the secret of even the small eddies with their seething foam . For easy classification , we call the two great parties into which Italy was split during Dante 's lifetime , Guelfs and Ghibellines ? Guelfs , the partisans of the Pope , Ghibellines , the partisans of the Emperor . But this classification requires to be constantly readjusted to fit special cases and changing conditions . From the beginning of the eleventh century , the rise of the communal governments , followed by rapid expansion of industry and trade ? not to mention other causes ? resulted in a large number of city-states . Since the days of ancient Greece , Europe had seen nothing like the intense , sturdy , highly individualized , and mutually suspicious , if not antagonistic , civic units that then flourished . They became republics in fact , and tended swiftly to independence from their nominal sovereign , the Emperor or the Pope . The nobles who dwelt in their fortress-castles in the country usually looked to the Emperor ; the cities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turned as naturally to the Pope . But it might happen , and it often did , that the Ghibelline nobles in a city were powerful enough or popular enough to lord it over the Pope 's men . As the cities developed , each was guided , just as ours are to-day , by its own interests or by the interests of its dominant class ; and it expected its titular sovereign , be he Pope or Emperor , to meddle as little as possible in its affairs . To be virtually free , it chose for its nominal protector whichever sovereign was less likely to interfere . As the Pope had no  |p472  army , he must rely upon his supporters to band together against this or that Ghibelline city or noble ; but such leagues were slow to form and hard to keep together ; and the Pope never hesitated to appeal to the King of France to send down an army to defend the Papal cause . The Emperor , on the other hand , came so seldom into Italy that his overlordship might prove so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guelf saw their obvious advantage in raising the Ghibelline banner . Conversely , where the Ghibelline prevailed , the ambitious and restless minority intrigued for succor from the Guelfs . And another cause of complication must not be forgotten . When a republic grew so rich or so strong that it coveted more land or wished to destroy a rival 's trade , the fact that both were Guelf or both Ghibelline , proved no bar . The stronger throttled the weaker . The outcome of all these goads to political passion was an almost chronic state of civil war ? of civil war under its most frightful form , when the contest is fought not over wide areas , with alternate battles and pauses , marches and countermarches , but in the streets of the same city , even in different quarters of the same palace . Pent up within narrow compass , party frenzy was all the more dynamic : it divided families ; it planted in every heart an implacable hatred . When modern nations go to war , it is their armies , not their people as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirteenth century Italy each citizen was liable , on turning the street corner , to run upon a party antagonist , whom he regarded as a mortal enemy . They might draw swords and daggers , and hack each other then and there ; or they might raise a hue and cry ? " Ah Guelf ! " " Ah Ghibelline ! " ? and in a flash the friends of both flocked to their support and a bloody fray ensued . But concrete cases are best . Let me cite two . At the battle of Montaperti , where the allied Ghibellines annihilated the army of the Florentine Guelfs and stained the Arbia red , Farinata degli Uberti , haughtiest of Ghibel/ line chiefs , seized Cece dei Buondelmonti and hoisted him onto his saddle , either to save his life or to carry him off as prisoner . But Farinata 's brother Pietro was so maddened at the sight of an enemy being spared that " he clubbed the captive to death on Farinata 's horse . " This exemplifies individual fury . For collective ferocity what can surpass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of war at Empoli just after this same battle of Montaperti ? For they seriously urged that the walls of Florence should be razed and the city demolished , so that it might never again be a nest for the Guelfs ; and had not Farinata clapped his hand on his sword and warned his fellow Ghibellines that he would defend his mother city against them as desperately as he had just fought to recover it from the Guelfs , the diabolical project might have been attempted . Such was the wild political environment amid which Dante was born and reared . While he was still in his cradle ; Charles of Anjou was appealed to by the Guelfs to help them punish their enemies ; and as a boy he witnessed more than one local fray . Those keen eyes of his ? none keener had ever looked through the faces into the souls of men ? watched the rival leaders pass to and fro , while his ears drank in the talk of the elders , and he learned history from those who were making it . He grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's party , but because in Florence it was then the democratic party . In 1289 , he did his duty as a soldier , " fighting valiantly in the front rank at Campaldino , " where the Ghibellines suffered a crushing defeat . But though their prestige was broken , they could still foment discord . In 1293 , popular government triumphed at Florence under Giano della Bella , yet in less than two years the nobles and burghers united and expelled him . For it was no longer a question between Guelfs and Ghibellines but between upper and lower classes , or , as we might say now , with proper qualifications , between capital and labor .  |p474  Dante was thirty years old when , in 1295 , he first took part in the debates of the city council . Still a Guelf , he upheld the cause of order within , and resented interference from without . But there was a new pope at Rome , Boniface VIII , a man of violent temper , which carried him at times beyond the borders of sanity , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He aimed at subduing Tuscany , which had been for two centuries a Papal fief , and at enforcing his authority in Florence . Accordingly , he demanded the renunciation of long-standing imperial rights ; and he abetted conspiracies . When he begged for aid , the French responded . He goaded faction against faction in the city itself , in order to make its subjugation easier . For the Guelf party had now split in two , and the new factions , borrowing names from partisans in near-by Pistoja , called themselves Blacks and Whites . A fresh outburst of internecine fury followed . Whilst serving as one of the priors of Florence , Dante clashed with the Papal legate . A few months later , Charles of Valois descended upon the city , restored the Blacks , took what booty he could , and departed . During this episode Dante was sent on an embassy to Rome , and while he was absent his enemies charged him with barratry and condemned him unheard to pay a heavy fine . As he could not or would not appear before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be burned to death for fraud and contumacy . It was early in 1302 that he thus began his life as an exile ? the life he was destined to lead for nineteen years . At the outset he naturally thirsted to be avenged on his tormentors ; and when his fellow Whites , from their refuges in Bologna , Siena , Arezzo , and other towns , planned a general attack on Florence , he joined them . But their efforts failed ; and within a year , Dante , for some reason which has not been cleared up , broke away from his White allies , broke away from all narrow , partisan bonds , and formed thenceforth a party by himself .  |p475  Year after year , until his death in 1321 , we have news of him passing up and down the Peninsula , chafing at the evil conditions ; heartsick from hope deferred , but still hoping ; looking now to one vindicator and now to another to put an end to wars and feuds and iniquity ; and , as the prospect of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly that the Lord himself would repay the wicked . How often , as we travel the roads of Italy , do we meet that lonely wanderer , garbed in the scholar 's gown , grim of feature , haughty as one who held hell itself in great scorn , his eyes intent on the inner visign , his lips firm-set or breaking now and then into an unwonted smile at the thought that beyond earth 's agony lay heaven 's peace ! Outwardly , during those years of exile , he seems the loneliest of any of the supreme sons of men . He had no intimates , no disciples , no home . Though all recognized his genius , they feared it . Grandees harbored him , but they made him feel that their bread was salt and their lodgings hard . He knew not only the terror of life , but what may be more depressing , its slow , corroding bitterness . No wonder that from the beginning of his " Divine Comedy " to the end , there is not a burst of hearty laughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Dante 's rack ? does not laugh . To great spirits , however , sorrow unlocks wisdom . In his wanderings , cut off more and more from political activity until he was reduced to addressing letters of exhortation or advice to personages who did not heed him , Dante meditated on the nature of government . The intense partisan became a political philosopher , and formulated , in his treatise " On Monarchy , " not merely his own mature opinions , but the political ideal of the mediaeval epoch , which , though he knew it not , was passing away . Mediaeval man believed that God had appointed two heads ? the Pope and the Emperor ? to rule over the Christian world . As the soul transcends the body , as the sun surpasses the moon in splendor and power , so the Pope  |p476  should transcend the Emperor . This simple scheme of superiority was devised by ecclesiastics for their own profit ; and it lay open , therefore , to suspicion . But in the uncritical age in which they slowly elaborated their system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they partly based their Papal claims . Though the illiterate secular kings could not out-argue the Papal theorists , in practical experience they took their own course whenever they could . A strong monarch resisted encroachments ; a weak one yielded . The French kings almost annexed the Papacy , and the Venetian Republic kept its independence down to the coming on of its decrepitude ; whereas English King John bowed to Innocent 's commands . Now Dante set up a counter-theory to the Papal . Monarchy ? the sway of a universal secular ruler ? is indispensable , he said , for the peace of mankind . There may be many local princes , but they must all submit to the Monarch . Who shall this Monarch be ? The Holy Roman Emperor : because God has designated through history that Rome is the world 's capital , and the Holy Roman Emperor is the heir of the Caesars . Ingenious and quaint , after the manner of medieval argumentation , are Dante 's proofs . Having established the Emperor as Monarch , he proceeds to combat the Papalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reason ; and he even asserts that the Emperor , deriving his authority direct from God , requires no confirmation from the Pope . " Let , therefore , Cesar be reverent to Peter , " he concludes , somewhat inconsequently , " as the first-born son should be reverent to his father , that he may be illuminated with the light of his father 's grace , and so may be stronger to lighten the world over which he has been placed by Him alone , who is the ruler of all things , spiritual as well as temporal . " Here at last we have Dante 's remedy for Italy 's political dissensions . He himself had been a zealous supporter of a faction in Florence ? but faction led inevitably to anarchy .  |p477  lie had been a White , hot and terrible in his dealings with the Blacks ? but that contest plunged Tuscany in civil war , and let havoc loose throughout Italy . He had yearned to fight his way back to his native city , to punish his foes there , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meditation in exile taught him that such a victory would only replace one tyrant by another , and so continue the chain of hate and wrath . He had been Guelf so long as he thought that the virtual independence of Florence was bound up in the ascendancy of that party ; now he became Ghibelline , the mightiest adherent the Emperor ever had in Italy . Ghibelline ? Yes : but not to make Florence less free , not to bind upon her , who had shaken off the fetters of the Pope , the shackles of the Emperor . He was a Ghibelline because he dreamed that the Emperor , possessing supreme physical force and acting from a plane so high that selfish or party considerations could have no influence over him , would impose peace on the feud-torn Italians . Under his regime they would discover that their interests were mutual , that they were indeed one people , brothers of different ages and talents , but still brothers , who could prosper best individually by working together collectively . Union and harmony depended upon peace ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dante was a Ghibelline . The union which he believed would flourish under the Imperial Pacificator did not resemble , of course , the political unity that exists to-day . In Dante 's scheme , each state would grow up independent of its neighbors ; but it would feel the compulsion of brotherhood and common interests so strongly that a formal pact of union would be unnecessary . Mr. Bryce tersely describes Dante 's book " On Monarchy " as " an epitaph instead of a prophecy . " An epitaph it was , indeed , so far as concerned the realization of its hopes in the fourteenth century ; but five hundred years later the Italians accepted Dante 's ideal as a prophecy , to be obeyed so far as the changed conditions permitted .  |p478  When Dante closed his eyes at Ravenna , in 1321 , he left Italy a country but no nation ? a geographical expression , cut up into many small states , riven by factions , the prey of tyrants at home , the coveted spoil of foreign conquerors . Such she remained down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation there was kept alive in the hearts of some Italians the conviction that they were one people , and the hope , if anything so indefinite may be called a hope , that somehow they must eventually be united in freedom . Petrarch , who writes a little while after Dante , pleads no longer for the Emperor to establish a government , uniform , just , and Christian , among the warring Italians . With the Pope a fugitive at Avignon , with Rome itself the victim of robber-nobles , with Florence the sport of popular hysteria , Petrarch thinks of peace rather than of unity . So a person in acute pain asks only for respite from that and does not hope for health . Still , in his appeals to Rienzi ( if it were Rienzi ) , and to the Princes of Italy , in two odes which are among the glories of Italian poetry , Petrarch presupposes an underlying solidarity among the peoples of the Peninsula . " Ancient valor , " he says , " is not dead in Italic hearts . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Tarpeian Rock may restore tranquillity to Rome . Petrarch always distinguishes between Italians and the rest of the world , just as Athenians , Spartans , and Corinthians , no matter how ferociously they fought among themselves , never forgot that they were Greeks first of all , and that not to be Greek meant to be barbarian . Petrarch seems to assume that the Italians are the chosen people , who , though sunk in political misery , have a special destiny awaiting them ? a destiny befitting the heirs of the glory and civilization of Rome , who founded , shaped , and still control the Church of Western Christendom . Since Italy has no overlord ? Pope and Emperor being beyond the Alps ? Petrarch exhorts her princes to dwell in amity : for amity will conduct  |p479  them to peace , and peace will cement that union which rests on reciprocal interests and common aspirations . Petrarch 's dream , like Dante 's , was unfulfilled . The Renaissance crowned Italy with the triple crown of painting , sculpture , and poetry , but left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for worldly possessions , the Popes had set up their petty secular kingdom , and in order to maintain it they fell back on the old expedient of appealing to transalpine sovereigns for aid . Even the pugnacious Julius II ? whose motto was , " Out with the barbarians ! " ? had no scruples against persuading those barbarians to join the league against Venice . Thenceforward , for above a century , the richest portions of Italy were fought over by France and Spain ; until , in due season , the foreigner , invited so often as a visitor , remained as master . Down to Napoleon 's day , the Spaniard and his descendants dominated nearly half of the country . The Austrian having nudged his way in during the middle of the eighteenth century , secured Venice by treachery at Campoformio , and by the redistribution sanctioned at the Congress of Paris , he became the virtual owner or protector of all the Italian states except Piedmont . Throughout these weary centuries voices are lifted in behalf of patriotism ? voices of lamentation , like those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an austere , indignant soul like Michelangelo , now the modulated classical echoes of Chiabrera , or again the plaintive treble of Filicaja , or the rebellious scorn of Alfieri . The patriotic ideal had not been quite quenched , but most of the patriots , disheartened by the present and hopeless as to the future , turned their gaze backward and sighed for the good old times ? those times which , like the childhood we reconstruct in our maturity , had never existed . Down to 1815 the Italians had sung and talked and even written freely of Italy , their masters being as undisturbed  |p480  as if the theme were Utopia or Paradise ; for Italy seemed , in truth , as unattainable as either . But after the Restoration the mere utterance of the word " Italy " was made in some places a penal offense ; and " Ausonia " had to be substituted for it by those who wished to refer to the geographical region , while its natives were Tuscans , Lombards , Neapolitans ? never Italians . So " liberty " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of the despots were among many evidences that the leaven of patriotism had begun to work and must be crushed . At last the Italians felt the new blood of nationality throb in their veins . They realized their degeneracy , and blushed . They craved to be released from bondage . They wished to be worthy of the world 's respect . During the next halfcentury they fought for three things which , one by one , they learned were essential to national existence . First , they demanded liberty ? life under a constitution that would curtail or correct the abuses of despotism . But liberty , they soon found , could never be durable without independence : because , so long as their rulers had Austria to rely upon , they might , as they did , call Austria in at any moment to annul the liberty they had speciously conceded . " Out with Austria ! " became , therefore , the battle-cry of Italian patriotism . Finally , unity must be won in order to bind together , fuse , solidify , and perpetuate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or another of these clues in hand , you will come safely through the labyrinth of the Risorgimento . And now from year to year the patriotic figure of Dante looms up more and more majestically . His countrymen perceived that he had not only embodied in his personal experience the suffering which tormented them , but that he had also lived in a divided Italy similar to theirs . They saw , too , that he had been insensibly unifying the Italians for five centuries through his " Divine Comedy . " A common language is the most obvious sign of kinship  |p481  among peoples of the same race dwelling in the same country . The Divine Comedy " did not create the Italian , but it ennobled that language , making it the peer of the few great organs of racial expression . Dante 's epic fixed for all time among the score of Italian dialects the standard of national speech . It was the earliest literary masterpiece of modern Europe , worthy to challenge the masterpieces of antiquity . Destined to be contemporary with each generation , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us of English speech . Dante 's words became household words ; his famous passages were familiar even to the masses who could neither read nor write ; the metrical forms he chose served as moulds for subsequent poets . Above all , his genius seemed to embody the manifold and splendid qualities of his race before the decay of the Renaissance had set in : he had intensity of passion ; intuitive appreciation of beauty ; vividness in description ; minute scrutiny of detail counterbalanced by the power to make vast abstractions real ; sublimity alternating with simplicity ; color as well as form ; an almost savage logic coupled with a celestial sweetness and sympathy . Thus " The Divine Comedy " became to the Italians the mirror in which each might behold his personal characteristics or study their racial composite . But it was more than this : for it contained an epitome of their culture , their history , their religion . As a moral code it was to them what the Bible became to Protestants . We can not measure the reaches of such an influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most pervasive . Who can compute what it meant for Italians between 1815 and 1848 to possess in his works and life a common meetingground ? Mazzini , zealously un-Catholic , the foe to all kinds of ritualism , the hater of sacerdotalism , the prophet of a modern religion based on the immediate access of the individual soul to God , read and re-read Dante and made Dante 's austerity and indignation his own . Silvio Pellico , broken  |p482  in spirit by the horrors of the Spielberg found in Dante the stay for his gentle piety . Gino Capponi , aristocrat , scholar , and patriot , earnest but temperate , solaced his blindness with Dante . And wherever there were exiled patriots ? at Malta , in Switzerland , at Paris , London , or Rio de Janeiro , in Uruguay , in the Argentine ? there were men who carried Dante in their hearts . His words became the law of their conduct , and by their devotion to him they all became Italians . That experience of exile , which thousands upon thousands of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or noble , or sensitive natures can suffer . It embitters the spirit ; it distorts the judgment ; it makes the gayhearted morose and the open-minded suspicious ; it fosters and intensifies the party fanaticism which may have caused it . Mazzini , who spent forty-one years of his life as an outlaw abroad , calls it " the Hell of Exile ? that lingering , bitter , agonizing death , which none can know but the exile himself ? that consumption of the soul , which has only one hope to console it . " From Dante , each Italian exile learned to take refuge in his conscience to " follow his star " no matter how far , , beyond sight the port might lie . And if he were tempted by the lure of permission to go home on condition that he would ask for pardon , how Dante 's words , written to a Florentine friend , must have heartened him : " This is not the way to return to my country , 0 my Father . If another shall be found by you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fame and honor of Dante , that will I take with no lagging steps . But if Florence is entered by no such path , never will I enter Florence . What ! Can I not look upon the face of the sun and the stars everywhere ? Can I not meditate everywhere under the heavens upon most sweet truths , unless I first render myself inglorious , nay , ignominious to the people and state of Florence ? " To their eternal honor be it recorded that many of the exiles of the Risorgi/ mento endured to the end , amid " unexpected poverty , " and died abroad , before Italy was redeemed . Of each of them , as of Dante himself , the epitaph might be " E venni dal rnartirio a questa pace " ( And out of martyrdom I came unto this peace ) . Finally , if we look at the more specific bearing of Dante 's principles on the problems of the Risorgimento , we shall see him continually appealed to in behalf of unity and of religious freedom . The unity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifetime ; and during the first half of the nineteenth century there was no supreme secular head , like the medieval Emperor , who , by keeping the peace among the warring princes of Italy , would promote union . But though the method Dante had dreamed of was unfeasible , the substance of his dream ? unity , integrally bound up with independence and freedom ? quickened the patriots of the Risorgimento ; and on at least one important point , his counsel was of incalculable value . Should Italy be united in a federation of separate states ? as Germany was later ? or should it be fused into a single , homogeneous nation ? Should it be a republic or a monarchy ? In groping towards a solution of these questions , the Italian patriots , no matter which path they took , always ran into what seemed an insuperable obstacle ? the Papacy . The outburst of patriotic enthusiasm which followed upon the election of Pius IX in 1846 , caused the granting of constitutions . Pius himself , the most amiable of men so long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apparently , he did not foresee how this popular dispensation would affect his position as Pope-King . As Pope , the head of the Roman Catholic Church , he ruled by absolute authority , to question which was heresy . How , therefore , could he , in his other role of constitutional king , consent to have his authority limited by the advice of his ministers or by the votes of his parliament ? His counsellors , as became the rigid logicians that they were , declared that he could not ;  |p484  and before the campaign for independence was fairly under way , the Pope withdrew his support from the holy cause . It took little persuasion on the part of those who controlled him ? Cardinal Antonelli and the Jesuits ? to make him believe that a lay government was impossible . Thenceforth the Papacy blocked the road to liberty . In like fashion it stood as a menace to independence . The Pope as King had fallen into such disrepute with his two and a half million subjects , that he was compelled to garrison his cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to protect himself from his own . The Italians drove the Austrians out of the North , but the French remained in the capital , where their presence prevented the Romans from completing the unification of Italy . Thus the Papal institution denied unity and independence as well as liberty , and raised until 1870 an unyielding barrier to the consummation of Italian patriotism . Now the Papacy , or the temporal annex of the Roman Church , existed in Dante 's time and had been judged by him . During the intervening five centuries , the Popes had embarked on the competition for worldly possessions ; had prided themselves , at the Renaissance , on being more gorgeous princes than any of their rivals , and had even aspired to possess a still larger state ; and as they had both spiritual and secular instruments at their command , they enjoyed an advantage over competitors who were only secular . Nevertheless , their ambition of ruling a large kingdom was dashed ; and from the middle of the sixteenth century the Papal States degenerated in governmental efficiency until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by French and Austrian bayonets . Some of the earlier patriots of the Risorgimento , led by Gioberti , cherished the dream that the Pope might be the head of an Italian Federation ; but bitter experience exploded their Neo-Guelfism and taught them that in the Temporal Power they had their most insidious enemy .  |p485  Without Rome , Italy could not be one ; but the ruler of Rome , in his capacity as Pope , proclaimed that in his capacity as King he could not grant the most ordinary secular requests . Every improvement , every innovation , might open a loop-hole for heresy ; accordingly , such secular matters as better drainage and the introduction of railways and telegraphs were frowned upon as agents of progress , and progress meant irreligion . But since civil governments exist to promote law and order and the health and welfare of their people , and the Papal administration had collapsed in all these respects , the Italians urged that the Papacy , an institution based on mediaeval conditions , had ceased to be compatible with modern life . And here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Throughout his works he denounces as unholy the union of Church and State . He deplores the secular expansion of the Roman bishops at its very beginning : " Ah Constantine ! of how much ill was mother , not thy conversion , but that dowry which the first rich Father took from thee ! " Dante shows how the accumulation of Papal treasures made popes worldly , avaricious , simoniacal . He called the Rome of his time the place " where Christ is bought and sold every day . " He did not hesitate to put several popes and great ecclesiastics in Hell along with other sinners . Had he lived to witness the Roman Court of the Renaissance ? of the Della Rovere and the Borgia , of the Medici and the Farnese ? we can only surmise what epithets and what new punishments he would have found for them . But Dante 's criticism went far deeper than the condemnation of certain popes . His indignation as a moralist who , in branding sinners , did not respect persons , was fortified by his convictions as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal . In his treatise " On Monarchy " he demonstrates not only that the Church has no power to bestow authority on the Empire , but that the Temporal Power of the Papacy , being derived neither from  |p486  natural law , universal consent , nor God 's law , is a usurpation . Christ himself declared , " My kingdom is not of this world , " and he bade his followers " render unto Cesar the things that are Caesar 's . " Just so far , therefore , as the Church usurps secular functions and confounds temporal and spiritual , she departs from the mission Christ assigned to her . When , further , her spiritual head , the Pope , assumes also the title and manner of a political prince , he denatures , even if he does not actually degrade , his spiritual office . Dante 's criticism , we perceive , although aimed at what he regarded as the unhallowed Pope-King combination , really strikes at the roots of all theocracy , whether Roman or Genevan , Mahometan , Anglican , or Hebrew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he believed that the rulers and ministers of the Church themselves could be saved from the debasement of worldly politics and lusts only by the complete separation of Church and State . So Lincoln urged that , among other reasons , slavery ought to be abolished in order to protect the slaveholders from its brutalizing effects . By his anti-theocratic , anti-Papal doctrine , therefore , Dante gave incalculable aid to the Italian patriots as soon as they realized that they could not unify Italy without abolishing the Pope 's Temporal Power , an institution that had long since ceased to exist on its own merits and needed to be galvanized into a simulation of life by foreign mercenaries and foreign protectors . The Papalists might stigmatize the latter-day Italian patriot as a subverter of society , a freemason , a , Red , an anarchist ; they might explain his acts as heresy ; but they could not dismiss Dante on any such grounds . Dante was a Catholic , on whose faith no shadow of heresy , no suspicion of schism rested . Dante painted Catholicism , the religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its religious development . He bequeathed to posterity an imperishable description of its ideals . Yet he , the supreme Catholic poet and layman , speaking two hun/ dred years before the Reformation and five hundred years before the Risorgimento , condemned the Papacy , the carnal consort of the Church , alike in its theory and in its practice . Thousands of his countrymen during the struggle for independence and unity , who were like him loyal Catholics in religion , had therefore an unimpeachably orthodox supporter when they demanded that the Papacy should no longer block the way to a United Italy . These are some of the aspects under which , directly and indirectly , Dante inspired Italian patriotism . Such inspiration can not be gauged by physical instruments . Someone has said that Emerson sent ten thousand sons to defend the American Union : the exact number does not signify ; the fact of his influence is everything . And so with Dante . The vicissitudes of his career were typical . The chaos of his thirteenth-century Italy still cried to heaven for settlement in the nineteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the absolute separation of Church and State ? proved indispensable to the attainment of that peace in which alone men and nations prosper and enjoy the largest liberty . For Dante held that liberty is sacred because without it we can not freely and gladly obey the will of God wherein we are at peace . From whichever side we examine Dante , we always come at last to Dante himself . He is the great fact ? poet , patriot , incarnation of the Italic genius , moulder of the Italian language , spokesman of the Catholic religion . For six centuries his influence has been to the spirits of his people what the Nile is to Egypt ; and as the Egyptians thrive when they draw most plentifully from the Nile , so the Risorginiento ? the season in which the Italians drew patriotic inspiration more than ever before from Dante ? is the period of their regeneration . Then at last they achieved the unity , freedom , and peace that he had dreamed .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
