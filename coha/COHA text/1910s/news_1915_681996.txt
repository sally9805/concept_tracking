" I am venturing to call this important news item to the attention of the public for the reason that the National Security League , the Defense League . and Other of our societies so assiduously devoted to the noble cause of preparedness have not yet done so .

Villa should be made an Honorary Vice President of them all without delay ; and I Would even suggest t hat he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rookie " Camp . It is bad enough for .1 InerieW to be lagging so far behind the standard set by Germany and other great countries of the world , but what are patriotic Americans to think when we can not even measure up to the Ideals of happy Mexico ?
