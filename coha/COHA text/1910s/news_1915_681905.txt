txt Enlargement of the shell orders being filled by the Westinghouse Electric &; Manufacturing Co. to nearly double the amount of the original order , indicates that the company should earn its common dividend in the current year twice over from that source alone . This , of cograe , will fall far short of measuring the company 's earnings , as it has other and larger war orders which promise greater profit . When the first contract for shells was accepted- by the company it was stated here that , without betterment of any kind in Westinghouse Electric 's ordinary business , the Profits on the shell order would ensure the payment of the 4% on the common stock for the current year . That first order amounted to $4,500,000 . But if that order had been in the form of a normal business contract it would have amounted to about $1 1,000.000 , as the company would have had to supply certain materials the cost of which would have to be embodied in the bill for the manufactured goods . Inasmuch , however , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gross revenue of the Westinghouse from the order was but $4.500,000 . With these shell orders growing from time to time to approaching double the original commitment , the net profits will grow at least correspondingly , without taking into consideration a larger margin of gain from increased production and perhaps lessened expenses through closer knowledge of the operations involved in the shell work . Probable profits on the rifle orders being filled by Westinghouse at the two Stevens plants acquired in New England continue the subject of conjecture without the publication of anything definite a , to the net gain involved . Management of the company absolutely refuses to commit itself to estimates of net profits until thoroughly familiarized by actual experience with the rifle manufacturing business . In commiting themselves to the rifle contracts , the Westinghouse board had before them estimates of what the contracts might yield in the way of profits but whether the actual results will accord with these estimates is still to be determined . These estimates set the net profits on the production of a million rifles at ** To fill this order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were filled the company could do not better than demolish these plants , the company still figured on a profit of $8,000,000 . Manufacture of 2.000,000 rifles would mean , on that basis , a net profit cf $18,000 , CO3 , since the cost of the plants would not have to be written off twice . It may take two years to turn out the 2,000,000 small arms so that not all of this profit could be assigned to any one year . In fact , it is doubtful if the current fiscal year may claim the production of a mill'on rifles . Ordinary business of the Westinghouse company is a bit better than a few months ago ; but operations of plants on those orders is only between 5,5% and 60% of capacity . The trend of orders is such , however , at to make probable a balance of 4% on the common shares from electrical business alone , which would be a result similar to last Assuming the filling of the first rifle contract in the current fiscal year , profits of the company from these various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated as follows : " Estimattli profit on 1,000,000 rifles after scrapping rifle plants . This balance for the common shares would be equivalent to practically 33% on the common shares outstanding . It is entirely an estimate and is given here for what it is worth . Against it may be set the possibility that the electical business may not do so well as last year and that the entire first million rifles may not be turned out and paid for this year ; on the other hand there is the probability that the shell orders may grow considerably over the present contracts . Ultimately . Westinelouse 's war contracts are likely to be larger than those actually signed up to date .
