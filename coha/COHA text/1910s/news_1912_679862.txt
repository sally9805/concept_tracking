txt A warrant for the commutation of the sentence of Charles W. Morse was signed at 6 o'clock to-night , to take effect at once . The fact was promptly telegraphed to the Warden of the Atlanta penitentiary . Designated as a special messenger by the Attorney General 's office , Mrs. Morse left Washington to-night for Atlanta , bearing the commutation papers . " I thank God , " she said , just before she boarded the train . " I could not have lived longer under the strain . My heart was breaking . Mr. Morse 's life is almost ended . No human being can know the suffering I have endured since my husband 's imprisonment ; I tried every means to bring about his release . " President Taft 's act was one of simple justice . If my husband did any wrong he has more than paid the penalty . His life has been forfeited . I have always ? believed and always will believe that he , was an innocent man  --  the scapegoat ofi others . " I have no hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though we can get him to Carlsbad , where he will have the benefit of the baths . " I have no criticism to make against any one . I know all the officers acted according to a sense of duty . But It is hard  --  hard to think that my husband 's life has been taken from him , and that he is paying the forfeit of his life . The Judge never intended to sentence him to death . " The President 's decision to act came after a long conference with Attorney General Wickersham , who yesterday went over the case in detail with Morse 's attorneys . A little after 5 o'clock this afternoon ** Wickersham went to the White House , taking with him a warrant for commutation , already filled out , and this decument the President signed after giving careful consid ( ration to a long series of mcdicai reports , which seemed to indicate that in doing this he would be giving the sick man only a few months , possibly only hours , to live in liberty before the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out at the White House : " The President this afternoon commuted the sentence of Charles W. Morse ; to expire at once . This action was taken upon the recommendation of the Attorney General , based on the following report of Surgeon General Torney : A careful review of these reports Ifmake It clear to my mind that he is sufering from a. combination of diseases , due to degenerative changes , which are Joncurable and progressive . The reports show that both the condition of-the-kid. ; neys and of the heart are growing worse . " ? I regard the attack of cardiac dyspnoea , or heart block , from which he suffered on the morning of the 15th instant as an ominous occurrence . In my opinion , the prisoner 's duration of life will be , in all.probability , less than one month if kept in confinement , and in the event of his release under commutation of sentence it is not probable that he will live as long as six months . ' " Investigations by Surgeons . By direction of the President last month a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. Birmingham , Major P. C. Fauntleroy , and Major F. F.

The board made a flying trip to Fort , where Morse had been removed from the penitentiary a few weeks before , to be under the special care of Major Frank C. Baker , surgeon at that post . The board spent a few hours with Morse and consulted with Major Baker , and on its return to Washington made a report to the effect that the prisoner was not in such a condition that the board could say that he would not regain a large measure of his health aind live for years , and at the same time he might die within a few months . The medical offi- ? cers cited cases where men , who had the same maladies that afflicted Morse . have been supposed to be dying , have been unconscious a week or ten days , and then have recovered to live ten years or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to commute the sentence , or grant the pardon that was asked . In the meantime Major Baker was directed to make frequent reports to the Surgeon General on the case , and Dr. Fowler of Atlanta , who was retained by Mrs. Morse , was permitted to forward to the Surgeon General and the Attorney General regular reports of his observations of the case . The reports of the two men tallied closely and went far to satisfy the Surgeon General , and later the Attorney Generals and the President , that a painstaking of-I fort was being made to get at the truth as to Morse 's condition The President decided last week that Morse should be taken to the Hot Springs Army Hospital , but the prisoner could not be removed and it was decided that the trip would hasten his death . A Serious Sinking Spell . Major Baker 's orders were to send a report each week , but of late he has sent three extra reports because of the sink , ing spell Morse suffered Monday night . Major Baker was awakened by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come and endeavor to give him relief from an aggravated condition of heart failure . By means of heroic remedies Morse was saved from what seemed to be approaching death . Major Baker sent a full report of this by telegraph to Gen. Torney , and the matter was duly reported to the President . The next day Mrs. Morse was in Washington to see the Attorney General , but was not able to do so and went on to New York . Morse 's attorneys also came here that day and remained until to-day to see Mr. Wickersham , and , if 1 necessary , the President . There is grave doubt whether Morse can stand removal from Fort , now , but as soon as he can be moved he ' will be taker to the home of F. L. ' Seely in Atlanta , where he will have every ' comfort . The interest of Mr. Seely , who is the owner of The Atlanta Georgian , in Morse 's case began soon after the arrival of the prisoner at the penitentiary .

This new-found friend went to Mr. Seely and ? told him what he knew of the banker prisoner and asked him to be friendly to him . From knowledge of the self-sacrifice of Morsc 's wife the Interest of Seely and his immediate friends grew , and they became ardent advocates of the man 's pardon .
