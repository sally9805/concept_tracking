Last month 's impressive triumph of a political party which was laid out for burial in 1896 , buried in 1900 , and solemnly commemorated in 1904 and 1908 , was a little upsetting to those who had put their trust in the professional skill of undertakers and pall-bearers . The fact that during the fourteen years after the supposed demise no heir appeared to claim the inheritance , or take the place of the departed , might have suggested the possibility of a mistake somewhere . At , all events , the entombed Democratic party emerged , and in one day put to flight its enemies . Undaunted by the failure of prophecy in this instance , an English newspaper correspondent thought it worth cable tolls to announce to his American readers the formation of a new British party . He is prudent enough to admit that " this is looking somewhat far ahead , " but believes that " many Liberals will be found eager to join the ranks of this new Whig or Centre party . " A look backward over English and American politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , except for Lord Randolph Churchill 's " Fourth Party " ? composed of four  --  and the recently arisen Labor Party , new parties have sprung from Constitutional crises . The Liberal Unionists and the Irish Nationalists were horn , however late , of the still-vexed Union ; while the persistent Conservatives and Liberals are only the old Tories and Whigs , fitted out with modern ideas and ancient prejudices . On this side of the water , the Populists are the only new organization of national scope which has figured in the political arena since the wedge of slavery cleaved its way through the parties of its time . Here , too , was a Constitutional crisis . The record of Presidential and Congressional campaigns is steadily a record of the Democratic and the Republican parties . Whether the course ' of the Socialists will more resemble that of the defeated but perennial Prohibitionists , or that of the victorious but vanished Populists , we do not predict . That it will follow a new line , leading to anything approaching even a balance of power , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was true before it . Federalists and Republicans became-Whigs and Democrats . The American and the Anti-Masonic parties were as lacking in nationality of scope as ' in attainment of power or in permanence . There seems to be in the Anglo-Saxon political nature a fine instinct for economy of effort . When old forms become outworn , they are still made to do service as patterns for new ones . Men go on in their old organizations , suffering from their defects and increasing maladjustments , but reluctant to displace them by new ones , until at length the perils of the untried seem lighter than the faults of the familiar . This vitality , not to say stability , of political parties would be impossible if parties were not representative , however unconsciously , of some fundamental distinctions in human nature . To be able to take fairly consistent positions with reference to successive and frequently unrelated questions , with the continuing approval of the great bulk of their members , would be a rare display of skill if it were not rather a result of instinct , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but most of their followers will act from motives not deeply reasoned . The further fact that parties in Anglo-Saxon politics are virtually limited to two , simplifies the analysis of their relation to the deeper springs of human conduct . Perhaps the old division into the party of order and the party of progress is as valid as any . Even with this instinctive response of outward organization to inner impulse , one thing is necessary to the securing of stability . That is sufficient elasticity to permit of internal reform , amounting at times to revolution , which shall make a new party unnecessary . It is in this element of party nature that our own recent times have been richest . Look at it as you will , the campaign of 1896 was " uniqtie , and was so because the prestige of a great party name was made to serve the purposes of a host of voters who , without it , would have been forced to the enormous undertaking of forming a new party . This may not have been immediately beneficial to the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that parties in enlightened coMmunities will forget again at their peril . It loosened party ties , and it revealed the possibility of swift and radical interior change . From both of these lessons , both parties , and the people they exist to serve , have since profited . Parties are hard to kill , even by their own mistakes . Important new parties arise only as last resorts , and voters will long put up with Hobson 's choice . Nevertheless , party vitality , in the long run , is conditioned upon party adaptability . Like any other organism , a party is subject to the blight that besets the unfit . But so Jong as it is reasonably responsive to public opinion , it will continue , under whatever changes of name and management , to serve successive generations  --  now as Government , and now as Opposition . CONCERNING " LAME DUCKS . " The Washington correspondents have had a good deal of fun over " Lame Duck Alley . " This is the name they have given to a screened-off corridor in the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electoral combat may meet TO display their wounds and compare notes about their chances for the future . All of them , of - course , hope ultimately to reach the - President , in order to lay before him their tale of woe , and to extract from him practical sympathy in the shape of a promise that " something will be done " for them after their term of office expires . In this expectation , obviously , lies the significance of the name jocularly given to them . They are " Lame Ducks " in the sense that they have been winged , but hope to preen their plumage again , if not to flap their pinions , in some other office . If the voters wo n't elect them , perhaps the Executive will appoint them . The spectacle is not novel . For many years lame ducks have hobbled back to Washington after losing elections . Their numbers are greater after a general debdcle , like that of 1890 or 1910 , but there are always some to be found . They belong to the political class that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief being avgilable for them , they seize upon the syste 'M of appointment to office . They eagerly go over the list of possible vacancies . They scan the roster of commissionerships and judgeships and marshalships , of collectorships and postmasters , feeling themselves fit for any office which they know they badly want . Their sufficient Qualification is that they need the job . They are men with " claims " ; they regard themselves as too important to be overlooked . Like the financial cripples in ' Wall Street who have been such great figures that they have to be " helped , " lest their hopeless crash should carry down others , the political lame ducks picture themselves as persons of such consequence that , if they are permanently left out of office , the whole party will be injured and the wheels of government come near stopping altogether . To Senator A , thoughtlessly voted down in his State , it appears incredible that he should ever become a mere private citizen ; while Representative B , overwhelmed by an adverse majority , will inevitably entertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work to earn his living . We do not say that all the lame ducks who , in past years , have been kindly picked up by compassionate Presidents and put in places in the public service , have been failures . Many of them , however , have been unquestionably . Mentioning no names , we will merely say that some of the ex-Senators who got berths on the Panama Commission were very slightly ornamental and not at all useful . Indeed , in the nature of the case , a lame duck is not , as a rule , fitted to be a valuable public servant . He is thinking more of his hurts , and how to heal them , than of his work . The office which is flung to him , like cold victuals to a tramp , he regards less as a recognition of merit , or even a balm to wounded dignity , than as a mere stop-gap . It is all well enough as a base of campaign , all too small though its supply of the sinews of war may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ready to march for another assault upon a seat in Congress . If appointing officers , therefore , are thinking more of efficiency than of charity , they will , in general , do well to pass the lame ducks by . It might be fairly argued that filling Federal offices with ex-Congressmen is against at least the spirit of the Constitution . Its framers guarded so far as they well could against the practice of preparing soft berths for injured statesmen to fall into . They made it unlawful , for example , to appoint any member of Congress to any office which had been created or the emoluments of which had been increased during his term of office . That sort of anchor to the windward was forbidden to any Senator or Representative looking forWard apprehensively- to a popular storm . Against the other thing there is no law and could not well be ; but against it there often is a feeling of propriety . It ought not to be supposed that there is any class of men whose disappearance from public life is unthinkable ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officeholder . We leave ex-Presidents to shift for themselves , and so we fairly may ex-Congressmen . If it is distinction that the latter crave , they might get it in being pointed to as " extinct volcanoes , " to use Disraeli 's phrase about discredited men . We do not deny that there is something pathetic about the lame ducks at Washington . The fondness for office has been said to be " an acquired taste " for most men , but it may be easily cultivated and soon becomes an imperious appetite . It is this , we suppose , and not merely salaries , which drives the sorrowing procession of unappreciated statesmen to the White House to ask for places within the President 's gift . They long for official dignity of some sort or other ; they still want a handle to their names . But they ought to be warned that , if they do not cease displaying their broken wings to the public , and squawking piteously for aid , they will , indeed , get a public title , but it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lame Ducks . SPEAKING OUT ABOUT THE SENA-TORSHIP . Woodrow Wilson promised the New Jersey voters that , if elected , he would go upon the plan of " pitiless publicity , " in all that related to the interests of the State , and he is living up to his word in the matter of the United States Senatorship . His public statement last Friday opposing ex-Senator Smith can be thought of as an astonishing procedure only in the sense that it is astonishing to find a public man doing after election exactly what before it he said he would do . Gov. - elect Wilson 's case stands by itself , but it is perfectly clear . His attitude is not " sprung " upon the people . This very issue was openly debated during his campaign , and both by speech and letter Dr. Wilson took a position which was entirely explicit . He frankly declared that a vote for him meant a vote for party leader ; and in his answers to the questions , put to him by Mr. Record , he stated in the most positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Smith ma chine , and that he should feel " forever ? disgraced " if he submitted to any kind of boss dictation . These assurances undoubtedly won him thousands of votes ; and he now stands forth simply as a man living up to his side of the contract . Even ? if he swore to his , own hurt , he changeth not . In his clear-cut announcement of his position , Dr. Wilson makes it plain that In coming out against Smith he is not speaking as Governor . He is , he admits , going outside of his " legal duties . " But , as he grimly remarks , " there are other duties . " A question of good faith with the people has arisen , and of " genuine representation " in the Senate , and he , as a citizen , and as a man who has taken upon , himself special obligations and responsibilities from which he can not shrink , does not propose to hold his peace . He has not spoken until it was necessary . Mr. Smith was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contest . But since he has refused to do so , Dr. Wilson calls upon the party to compel him to that course . There can be no doubt of the result . James Smith can not stand up against Woodrow Wilson . Whether knowingly or unwittingly , the Democratic party of New Jersey has elected a real man Governor , and is bound to follow where he leads . A breach with Smith does not matter , even an angry quarrel within the party is of no consequence , compared with the overmastering duty of keeping faith with the people . It is important to notice precisely what it is that Woodrow Wilson is at tacking . In a word , it is an attempt secretly to circumvent the will of the people . Smith has made no open canvass . His own newspaper , the Newark Star , has kept as silent as the grave about his candidacy . There has , in fact , been no public advocacy of his election , worth speaking of . Such expressions of opinion as have been made are nearly all against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being put quietly into operation . Every kind of subterranean influence has been exerted , every hidden wire pulled , midnight conferences held , furtive appeals made to this local boss and the other politi- , cal dealer . The whole Smith campaign has , in fact , been under a blanket ; and what Woodrow Wilson has done is to tear the blanket off . The thing can no longer be done in a corner . There must now be open discussion , and the Senatorship will be settled in the full light of day . This is the old fashion , and it is the only democratic fashion . As the Prime Minister of France said the other day , in his address at the unveiling of the monument to Jules Ferry , " power in a republic rests , not upon silence , but upon debate . " New Yorkers , as they look across the North River and see the policy of covert scheming for a United States Senatorship shattered by the bold act of Dr. Wilson , can not avoid a feeling at once of envy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Senator by arrangement , not by free and public canvassing of the merits of the different candidates . All the talk of the political quidnuncs in New York is of some one to be " seen , " of some interest to be privately conciliated , some secret shuffling of the cards in order to get a winning hand . The friends of certain candidates are , it is true , pressing their claibis in public by every fair argument and honorable effort , but it is impossible to be blind to the general expectation that , in the end , everything will be settled by two or three men . They , meanwhile , are pursuing the same plan as James Smith  --  saying nothing , discussing nothing , proposing no one , but plotting in the dark and assuming the right to impose their will upon the Legislature . This can not go on . The people in New York are no more ready than those in New Jersey to see a United States Senator drawn out of a boss 's hat . Sooner or later , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the open , a free field and fair play , election of Senators on the principle of the survival of the fittest , not the machine elevation of the unfit . RAILWAY RATES AND RAILWAY ECONOMIES . In the current Outlook , Mr. Walker D. Hines sets forth temperately and clearly the grounds on which the railways believe themselves justified in asking for higher rates . His fundamental thesis agrees with that of numerous witnesses in the recent inquiry ; it is , that a railway must have the opportunity to earn enough to pay interest on its debt and satisfactory dividends on its stock , and , in addition , a surplus large enough to keep the property up to date . Mr. Hines argues that , under present conditions , these purposes can not be achieved except through a substantial increase in the company 's net revenues . On his own railway , Mr. Hines points out , expenditure for new equipment and betterment , during the fourteen years since the Atchison 's reorganization , has averaged $9,000,000 per annum , but in the past five years it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of expenditure , he thinks , " will increase continually and progressively . " This money can be raised in four ways only  --  by taking it out of profits , by selling new stock , by issuing bonds with a mortgage on the property , or by borrowing on promissory notes or bonds without a lien on the property . The Atchison 's property , Mr. Hines shows , is already mortgaged up . In order to pay for improvements from the surplus , the surplus must be earned , and in order to sell stock or unsecured bonds and notes , such new securities must be offered by a going enterprise , paying " a sufficient dividend on the common stock to make that stock attractive as an investment . " This , he believes , necessitates higher railway rates . The Outlook article did not discuss the phase of the question on which Mr. Brandeis insisted in the recent Washington hearing  --  reduction in working costs through scientific management . This consideration Mr. Hines takes up in a letter to the Nation which we print on another page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he raises two points which , he believes , would militate against that plan as a complete solution of the financial problem of the railways . One is the fact that , in his judgment , introduction of such a system , in so extended an industry , would be " a matter of years or decades , " whereas " the protection of railway credit is of vital , immediate interest . " The other is the attitude of organized labor regarding piece-work and the bonus system . Each of these counter-arguments has force , and calls for careful consideration . The one regarding the position of labor is to some extent borne out by Mr. John Mitchell 's interview of last Sunday , declaring that " organized labor is against the premium or bonus system of payment to the workman , because that is designed to speed up the workman beyond the safety line . " We doubt , however , if Mr. Mitchell has clearly understood the purpose of the system which he was criticising ; which , in reality , is based , not on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economizing to the uttermost the workman 's expenditure of energy . Mr. Ray Morris , in his practical work on " Railroad Administration , " explains the feeling of railway labor by " the unfortunate fact " that , in experiments on the basis of individual effort , managers have sometimes tried " to make the exceptional record of one season the minimum standard of the next , so that the only result of brilliant work was to make it progressively harder for the average worker to earn his living . " But nothing could possibly be further away than this from intelligent scientific management . Mr. Hines 's argument that the railways can not safely wait for the complete introduction of a new system of labor supervision has more weight , though , naturally , its conclusiveness depends on the argument from necessity . It must frankly be said that an argument which begins by assuming that a given enterprise must pay a satisfactory dividend . on its stock , leads to some logical difficulties . Some companies have been large borrowers on both notes and bonds , when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtless , have to bid a higher price for money , either through actual rate of interest paid or through discount on the selling price of their new securities ; but that is the lot of other business enterprises . Union Pacific was able to raise money enough to buy the Southern Pacific and half of the Northern Pacific 's stock , when it was paying only 4 per cent . dividends on its own ; yet there are numerous railway men who declare 6 per cent . to be imperative . We are not arguing for lower dividends , but we do not see how Mr. Hines 's full assumption can be accepted unless we recognize a quasi-responsibility on somebody 's part to guarantee railway dividends . But , if so , then what is to be the outcome with inefficiently managed or unfavorably located railways ? And how are we to escape the paradox of an advance in rates when general business is at its worst  --  on the ground that the reduced volume of traffic will , at the previous rates , no longer suffice to pay last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conclusion at which the Interstate Commerce Commission arrives in the immediate question of next season 's railway rates , it will not do to drop the matter of scientific management . There was great force in this remark by Mr. Henry R. Towne , in his testimony last month at the rate inquiry : I am not here to oppose the proposed increase of freight rates I do not know whether the railroads should have it or not . If they are entitled to it , they ought to have it But I see this fact , as a manufacturer ; that , whereas , in other industries , when we are confronted by too close an appx'oximation of our income to our expenditure , competitive conditions rarely , if ever , permit us to open the interval to the point which will cover a fair profit by putting our prices up . Our competitors will not permit of our doing that . We have to meet the competition , and , therefore , we are compelled to look within for the remedy  --  not to pass the burden on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find Some way of relief . We have done it again and again , successfully , on a great scale in hundreds of thousands of cases , and it is one of the many illustrations of what is commonly understood as a blessing in disguise .
