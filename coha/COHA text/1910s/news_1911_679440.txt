txt At a stormy meeting of the Executive Councils of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters of New York and Jersey City in Chelsea Hall , 161 Eighth Avenue , lasting from 8 : o'cleck until midnight , it was decided last night that unless the Adams Express Company agreed to receive a committee of its striking drivers , with a view of settling the present difficulties , either by arbitration or otherwise , a. general strike of all the drivers and helpers of every express company in this city and Jersey cur will be called . A representative of the Adams Express Company when informed early this morning of the action of the Executive Council said that he did not regard the new move as particularly serious . He said : " We will continue to go ahead as we have since the strike began . We have 1 been and are willing to meet our own men , but we will not treat with any outside organization . This has been our position all along . " The company has until this evening to meet the conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a general strike will be called immediately . For the present the chauffeurs of the taxicab companies and other teamsters will not be affected . It also was agreed at last night 's meeting to place William H. Ashton , General Organizer for the American Federation of Labor , in full charge of the present strike . Mr. Ashton had charge of the recent express drivers ' I strike . This takes the situation entirely out of the hands of Howard P. Biggs , Chairman of Local 487 , who has been in charge thus far . It was decided that every member of every union in the International Brotherhood in the city be assessed $1 a week as long as the strike lasts . This will , mean an addition of about $22,000 a week Ito the treasury of the organization for Ithe benefit of the strikers . After the meeting Mr. Ashton explained that the agreement to call a general strike of express drivers and helpers unless the terms laid down were agreed to by the Adams Company had the indorsement of the American Federation of Labor officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , will be carried on more aggressteely than the last one . " I am to have full charge of the strike from now on , " said Mr. Ashton , " and it will be a fight to a finish . There are many grievances which the strikers have and of which the public know nothing . We have gone slow In this matter , but the time has now come when the unions will have to act for their own self-preservation . " The officials of the Adams company have steadfastly refused even to see delegations or committees from the strikers . If they refuse to see a committee to-morrow , nothing can prevent one of the worst strikes the city has Been . Just when the employes of the other express companies wilkbe called out it is too early to say , but it will be within a few days . ' Help First Was Refused . Earlier in the day the Executive Committee of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters had not decided to call a general strike . The members of Local 487 , composed entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agent Charles of the Adams Company refused to compromise they would appeal to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters to declare a general strike . They made the appeal , but at that time it fell upon unresponsive ears . Another blow to the hopes of the strikers was dealt early in the day when a majority of the American Express Company employes , who compose the American Express Employes ' Association , met in their clubrooms , 67 Madison Avenue , and passed resolutions repudiating the strike , and asking for the support of all in their efforts to preserve their liberty and their rights to earn a living . The members of the association believe in the " open shop . " In joining they resigned from the labor unions and agreed to hate nothing more to do with them . It was said last night that if the Adams employes lose the present strike it will go a long way toward ending hope of establishing a union of the express drivers here . The resolutions of the American Express Employes ' Association ran : Whereas , This association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Union , or any other labor organization , except the American Express Employers ' Association . Whereas , Efforts have already been made to intimidate or overawe and terrify certain of our members , be it Resolved , That we hereby call upon cur. fellow-citizens of brew York of whatever station of life to give ns their moral support in the effort we are making to preserve our liberty so that we may continue to work for the support of our families . we have no grievance against the American , National , and Westcott Express Companies : we have no demands to make upon them , and inasmuch as we are dependent on the public for our livelihood , we would request that we be permitted to continue in the pursuit of same without molestation . Officials of the Adams Company said yesterday that they were having no difficulty in keeping all their wagons moving . There is no longer accumulations of freight in their depots , they said , and everything was running just as smoothly 1 as if there had been no strike whatever . Assaults had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but said it did not interfere with the moving of the wagons . Will Grant No Terms . " It is useless for the strikers or their representatives to bother us about coming to terms , " said an official of the Adams Company . " We have no terms to grant . If the strikers want to come back to work they are at liberty to do so . Their jobs are waiting for them , but we have no terms to offer . We do not intend to recognize the strike or the unions by dealing with committees or representatives . " So far as we are concerned the strike is already over . We are moving our wagons promptly and we have no difficulty in securing plenty of drivers and helpers , The situation has cleared up in Brooklyn , Harlem , and Jersey City , and it is fast being straightened out in Manhattan . It appears that there is little or no prospect of . a general strike of express drivers being called or a call being heeded if it is made . " The employes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their treatment . As for our employes , the majority are not in sympathy with the strike , but they went out because they were forced to do so . Thar men have no complaint about their treatment and are ready to return at a moment 's notice . Their jobs are ready whenever they do return . " Secretary Biggs called a meeting of the st-ikers yesterday afternoon at Central Hall , .229 Fast Forty-seventh Street , and a committee from there waited on General Agent at the company 's main office . It returned with the announcement that Mr. was too busy to see them . The announcement was greeted with hoots and yells . After the meeting Secretary Biggs said that every express driver and teamster in New York would strike . " It is not our fault if a general strike is called , " said Mr. Biggs . ' We have tried to meet representatives of the bosses fairly and talk over the situation with them . They refused even to see our committee . The life of our unions is at stake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and follow our action . We know that the Adams Company is not having the easy time they maintain to move their freight and conditions are going to grow worse . Before the end of the week every express driver , helper. , and taxicab chauffeur in the city will be With us . " A few hours later Secretary Biggs had modified his opinion . He was n't sure that the other unions would join the strike . Everything , he said , depended upon the action of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters . Wagons are Attacked .. Mien the stables . of the Adams Company in East Fifty-sixth Street , near Third Avenue , opened for business yesterday morning fifteen heavily loaded wagons , each with one driver and at least two helpers aboard , started for the depot at Forty-eighth Street and Madison Ave-i nue . They were quickly surrounded by a threatening crowd which followed them for many blocks , many hurling stones and bricks . At Madison Avenue one of the wagons was attacked just as it turned the corner . Two of the guards jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining climbed up ? on the driver 's seat , and was hit on the head by a brick . He fell across the lap of the driver unconscious . The horses became frightened and ran two blocks , when they were stopped by a mounted policeman . The injured man , Thomas Boyle , was carried into the company 's depot and his wounds dressed by an ambulance surgeon . The man who threw the brick escaped . As other wagons left the stables they passed through showers of bricks and bottles thrown from the roofs of nearby dwellings . Patrolmen and detectives went to the roof and found a crowd of men . women , and children , who ran over the housetops and disappeared through an open scuttle . A police guard was then placed on the roof . The police arrested two striking drivers , who were arraigned before Magistrate Corrigan ? in the Jefferson Market Court and fined $10 each . Within an hour and a half after being arrested by Policeman Bartels for throwing a stone at an Adams Company wagon , Cornelius Savage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arraigned in the West Side Court Magistrate Harris said : " Any man who wants to work in the district covered by this court will have ample protection , and I will not stand for any outside interference . " Four men attacked Abraham Simon , a helper employed on an Adams Company wagon , as he wasleaving an Eighth Avenue store at noon . Jumping into his wagon , he lashed his horse and escaped , but when he reached the stable in West Forty-seventh Street he went home , saying that he did n't think he cared to be a strike breaker any longer . Express business moved so quietly in Jersey City yesterday that police protection was in a measure withdrawn . Only about half the number of policemen . were on duty in comparison to the day before .
