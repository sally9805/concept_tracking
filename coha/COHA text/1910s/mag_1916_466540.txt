The first of the letters which follow was written in response to Mr. Deland 's question asking X 107 how it was pos ? sible to reconcile her love of beauty and appreciation of goodness with her career as a criminal . You ask me how I reconcile a love of poetry , an appreciation of " sweetness and light , " with my career as a criminal . You once quoted Montaigne as saying he " loved stout expressions among gen ? tlemen , " and your use of direct words is as much a delight to me . I can some-how talk to you straight from the shoul ? der , and Pli try not to spare myself now .. In earlier days I always thought that I was subject to moods . But as the years went by , and I watched other people , I suddenly realized that the strange con ? tradictions in my nature were not moods , but something far more mystifying and dangerous . There was an inner some ? thing that dragged me from the com ? fortable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was never satisfied until it had plunged me into the depths of indecency and kept me wal ? lowing there . At first these attacks came at long intervals , and were of short duration , and the reaction was almost unbear ? able . The tortures of hell were tame compared with my sufferings . It left me sick to the soul , and so shaken that I was sure of nothing in heaven or on earth but one thing , and that was that this thing would come again . I was depressed for weeks , and filled with an agony of shame for my actions , but did not know how to prevent them . This would gradually wear off , but when I felt most assured that I had the thing by the throat , it would suddenly rise up and knock down all the barriers of good that I had built around it , and , absolutely against my will , my inclina ? tion and common sense , I would do its bidding and sink into the depths again . This began to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? sensitive . I finally had to arrange for separate homes for these two selves of mine . I cast off all friends and relatives , and disappeared . giving myself up solely to the task of appeasing the craving of both the black and the white part of me . A clean little room , whose windows looked out on a green lawn dotted with old-fashioned flower-beds , was one place of refuge , where I came and went at will , or remained there until the other self rose up and smothered all the " sweet ? ness and light , " when I hastened to the other home , the home of thieves , gam- blers , gunmen , jailbirds , and dope fiends . The lowest types of the underworld were there , and I fitted into the sur ? roundings and company as if I had lived there before , and had been away on a journey , and had just returned to a life that seemed perfectly natural to me . I needed no coaching , and seemed no dif ? ferent than the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my advice often asked . All the crime , sin , filth , and beastliness did not shock nor horrify me , and I never noticed the beautiful . Here it never bothered me . There was no ecstasy at the sight of a woolly lamb cloud , as there is now . The sky was merely a place to tell whether it was to be fair or cloudy . I had no dislike for certain colors , as my other self had . I was like a cat who purrs and dozes in front of a huge fire , half awake and half asleep , but per ? fectly satisfied and very comfortable . Only once did I notice flowers , and that was when I flew into a rage and scratched and bit one of the gamblers because he threw some pansies out of the window , and used the glass that had held them for his liquor . I find myself wondering how pansies came into that room . I do n't know who put them there ; one of the women who came there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some memory , green in spite of her present life , that prompted her to give them a drink of water out of the nearest thing at hand ? a sticky , broken whisky-glass . I wonder now whether those pansies had not pressed the button and made some spark leap into those instincts of beauty lying dormant and smothered under those evil appetites . After scenes like this the place would suddenly grow disgusting , the filth and cursing nauseating , and the whole atmos ? phere unbearable . I would then take my ? self off to my other home , where I would be ill for days with remorse , humiliation , and anger at the knowledge that I had again allowed this inner thing to drag me through the mire . I called it names , and begged it to leave me alone , and even prayed about it . The sight of the beautiful filled me with unutterable longing , sadness , and seemed to re ? proach me . I even contemplated suicide . But the good part rebelled at leaving undiscovered beauties , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last time that the black inner thing would overpower me . In my better moments I was deeply religious , andshrank from coarseness in any form . Does that seem like hypocrisy ? It was not meant as such . It was simply natural . Finally I surrendered . The black part was too strong , and I was weakened with continually fighting it . So , with my eyes wide open to the consequences , I went back to the den of thieves to stay . I made up my mind to fight the thing with its own weapons . If it craved sin , I would give it all it wanted , and more . I would stuff it , as one does a fancy bird , until it dies from overgorging . But I did not find the life hard . Nothing mattered but evading the law . I had no regrets , and woke in the morning eager to be at it again . All decent feeling was numbed . No remembrance of other days haunted me , but I always seemed to be waiting ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprisonment . How I got there , and what I was there for , I could not tell . From the time that the judge sentenced me until I reached the prison I was like a person in a stupor . I was taken there in a motor , for they classed me as a dangerous criminal , who might try to make a get ? away on the cars . A matron sat beside me , and the deputy who sat in front watched every movement of mine in a reflecting mirror . Inside the prison doors , I waited for some time on a long bench in a large hall . At intervals officers passed by and gazed at me curiously , and several asked my name . Then I was taken to the receiv ? ing-room and turned over to the re ? ceiving matron . Piece by piece my clothing was taken from me and thrown into a heap . When I was ordered to bathe in full view of this matron , I was so filled with an agony of shame and indignation that I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my mind they were worse than the people I had just left . Even when I had put on the coarse , clean clothing , 1 felt more naked than I had ever done before , and I felt so de ? graded that the last remnant of respect I had ever had for myself seemed to have been snatched away from me . Another simple little thing maddened me . The shoes were three sizes too large , and when I left the receiving-room I scuffled along the hall , admonished by the matron to step lively . I lost one shoe , and as I picked , it up I was filled with an almost uncontrollable desire to hurl it at her head . But I thought bet ? ter of it , and it 's good for me that I did . I said to myself that it would n't hurt her to have given me a word of good advice . If she had I probably would have worshiped her . I was next handed over to another matron , a motherly400king woman , who proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now unlocked two heavily barred wooden doors and put me into a fair-sized room , and left me there . I sat down on a little wooden stool , and watched her as she left the room . I wished she would say a kind word to me , but it did n't come . I listened as she locked and bolted the doors and the jingling of her keys ceased , and then I realized that I was alone , and this was the end , for I believed that I was going to do my whole sentence in that awful MOM . My heart was like a heavy stone , and a feeling of utter isolation swept over me , like a child wakening suddenly in the night to find itself alone in the dark . I had a shuddering , sickening sense of clipped wings , and I started wildly up and rushed madly around the room , from the heavily shuttered window to the double wooden door through which no sound could come , in a perfect agony of fright . I beat madly on the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cot-bed and stamped on them . I raged up and down for hours like a caged beast , with only one wish in my mind ? to go mad and forget . Something said , " Pray . " But I laughed at the thought . As the hours passed I became ex ? hausted , and , looking at the bed , it suddenly came to me that here at least I could sleep . A breathless sense of safe ? ty swept over me . Perhaps , bad as this was , it might save me from worse . And far , far down was the thought that here , at least , though the Beast might tear me , it could not drag me in its own slime . There was a comforting sense of security , and , strangest of all , the waiting feeling had suddenly left me ; and , sobbing and moaning , I crept into the bed and slept . Never in the long time I was there did I think that it was I that was there . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course she de ? served to be there . She was a terrible creature . But of course she had nothing to do with me , for the real I was out ? side the gate , sending in messages of beautiful things , of April skies , of slant ? ing silver rains , and of birds twittering in a blushing apple-tree . Night after night I would toss in my narrow bed , and talk to the black thing within . It was as if it was another person in the room with me . " Well , you 've had your way , " d would say ; " you 've got me where you wanted to , and now you 've gone your limit , and you 'll stay here . You 'll die here , for you 'll never go out with mel " It filled me with glee to think I could fool it . My other self would join me at the gate ? that much I was positive of ? and we would go away together and leave the other one dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have happened , or whether I would have been able to carry out this plot of mine , if I had been put to labor that was not interesting to me . Very likely I would have ended in the dungeon in handcuffs , like other poor devils whom the authorities can ? not understand , and who can not under ? stand themselves . I began to read as soon as I was put in a cell where there was a light , and I can not describe the joy that swept over me when I found that a veil had been torn from my eyes , and I saw , not only the printed words , but the exact mean ? ing that was behind them . An apt phrase or a chance line of poetry so delighted me that it brightened my gray days like a burst of sunshine after a thunder-storm . Rhymes danced in my head , and I was obsessed with beautiful ideas . It quieted , soothed , and refreshed me , and I often fell asleep at night re ? peating lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wonder now at my passionate love for poetry ? It was my salvation , my beckoning star . It purified me , and lifted me out of the depths onto the heights . It was the mes ? sage , as I said before , that the other part , waiting outside the gate , sent in to me . All the while I was growing inside . A new me was pushing its way into the light . I became absorbed in studying the different characters with whom I lived . Here all were thrown together . Old-timers who have spent the greater part of their lives in prison were mingled with the first offenders . It 's bad . What the first offenders do n't know about crime , the old-timers teach them . A cottage system is badly needed . Then , too , for the first five months one is in a cell without a light . One ca n't read , and thinking is enough to drive one crazy . All these things need money , but , oh , it would be so worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when you come out you are handicapped . It is like so much time lost out of your life . The girls go out of doors more , and it is such a blessing . The sweetness of such hours out of doors lasts for days and leaves the women in a much better frame of mind and easier to handle . I suppose you are thinking of those that ca n't read . There is a school , but I wish that there was some way of send ? ing in crochet-cotton and crochet-nee ? dles . Those who have money can , of course , buy these things ; but those who have neither friends nor money are de ? nied the pleasure which such work brings to many . I was interested in my work , for I loved to create . As the months went by the only bitterness in my cup was the fact that I had no one to take me out . I was as alone as Robinson Crusoe before he found Friday ! No home , no friends , no money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housework . As each girl was taken out by friends , my heart grew heavier and heavier . " So-and-so 's mother came for her to-day , " would be passed along the line . Or this one 's brother , or that one 's father or husband . I tried to be glad for them , and wondered if my time would ever come . I was beginning to despair , and the " yesterdays " to drag , when out of the nowhere you came . I went to the office in fear and trem ? bling , for I thought I had broken a rule . I came out walking on air . T was on an equal footing with the others . I had a friend ! You know you are thought very little of among your fellow-prisoners if you do n't have at least one visitor . You are sort of a nobody in prison social circles . What I said I do n't remember . What you said I lived on for weeks . Still , I must confess I was rather suspicious . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for themselves , and I could not quite figure out what you were going to get out of all the trouble you were taking . Had I been a very young girl and good to look upon , as youth always is , it would have been different ; but being very ordinary-looking ( I 'd rather be ugly any day than ordinary looking ? it 's more individual ! ) , I was nonplussed . Can you answer , right off the reel , what the happiest moment in your life has been ? I can beat you to it ! Not when they called me from my work to be dressed for my release . No ; T could n't be happiest when I knew there were a hundred pair of eyes , wistfully watching me leave the room , wishing they were going , too . You ca n't say good-by . It 's a house of silence , and there 's a stifled sob in your throat , and you are almost sorry to leave the companions of so many long , long days . Not when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bid me godspeed , and admonished me to be true . No ; I wanted to cry then . But it was when you gave the order for the motor to go ahead , and we shot out into the open road , and I left all the old life behind . Moments like that are lived but once . Riches suddenly bequeathed me ? ? the thrill would be tame beside it . A medal pinned on my coat by the highest of highs ? ? not momentous at all ; a mere nothing compared to it . I chattered of this , of that , of anything at all . Do you remember ? What a bundle of nerves you must have thought me ! But I apologize . I was too excited to be polite , and 1 had n't talked for such a long time . I wanted to say everything at once , and to thank you , and to make all sorts of promises . But I saw everything . That ride , that ride ! I shall never forget it . I wanted it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart of the setting sun . And so , as dusk began to shake out her silvery veil we drew up in front of the quaint little old-fashioned house , where you had arranged that I should stay during a part of my probation . I have never been able to tell you how that little house impressed me . You never told me anything about it . Even to this day I never make a move to shake hands first . There are those who would n't carc to shake hands with a former criminal . And so when those two ladies came out on the lawn and took me by the hand , I was theirs to do with as they wished , and I knew that it would be the right thing always . After you had gone I felt timid , and although I wanted to thank them and tell them that I meant to do my best , I was clumsy about it , and stumbled and stammered over words that would not come . But once in the beautiful old library , with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more at ease , and here they told me that I was to be as one of them , and that from then on none of us was to refer to the past . Think of it ! I was to be put on an equal footing with cour ? teous , well - bred , intellectual people , with no slurs or flinging up of past deeds ! They put me to work at once out in the fields . We worked side by side , sharing alike in all labors , which became a perfect joy to me . Do you recall asking me on the way down what I wanted to do the most of all things I said I wanted to go to my room , and shut the door , and then open and shut it just as many times as pleased me . Well , I did it ! t never slept in a locked room when I could help myself . I planted potatoes , hoed , hilled , gathered , and ate them . All day long I was out of doors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life to me . Every one was kind to me , and at night , when the lamp was lit in the living-room , throwing shadows on the beautiful old sofa where Whittier , Longfellow , and other poets had once sat , and on the antique furniture and quaint , old dishes , we would read together , and discuss the leading questions of the day . Such wonderful , scent-laden nights ! Such wonderful gardens ! And oh , what sun ? sets ! I was so happy that the days were never long enough . I tried to please , first because you put me there , next because they were kind to me , and last , but nut least , because I wanted to be a decent woman and a good citizen . And when at last they said that I was trust worthy . my cup was overflowing . Yet underlying all this , ecstasy was a dull ache for the comrades I had left behind . There is to-day , and always will be . So , dear friend , this brings me up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poise until I got hack to the city and had to rub elbows with the business world again . Of course it is hard for me to get any sort of a situation where long experience is required . Two years are gone from my life that I ca n't account for . So every once in a while finds me up against it . But oh , it is good to live , and live clean . I have no intimate friends , but I have some books , and every once in a while a letter from a very dear lady whom I know . I sometimes get tired of Mr. Wall and Mrs. Wall and the two little Walls , but then my room is cozy , if small , and I can open and shut the door when I like . Do not think that I do not mix with the old crowd of sin because it would get me into trouble . That is n't it . I 'm clean , and I 'm going to stay clean , so that I can look the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head . Besides , if you must have the truth , I have no appetite for such things . The thought of it fills me with loathing and disgust . Did I tell you that one of the matrons met me the other day , and as I am quite fond of her I went up and made myself known . She said she never would have known me , I have changed so . Who knows but what , if I keep on changing , I 'll become a beauty ! Stranger things than that have hap ? pened , and one of them is that my penu ? rious landlady has n't tacked twenty-five cents extra on to my room rent for the gas I have burned while writing to you . Good night . I 'm off now to indulge in my greatest dissipation ? mailing letters . EXTRACTS FROM OTHER LETTERS September 2 . When I think sometimes that my identity may be discovered , I turn sick with fear . It is a dreadful secret to carry around . R ? , whom I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in speech as well as looks , and is so interested in my verses that I am im ? mensely flattered . Anyhow , thanks to you , I find myself picking much wiser associates , and I think they will be my salvation . I am still out of work , but I am helping out in a lunch-room from eleven to half-past three , which keeps the proverbial wolf from coming to life . This is only temporary , but I think I am lucky , for it means one square meal a day at least . Oh , such a crowded , lonesome city ! It is a very dangerous thing to be unem ? ployed where there are lights and laugh ? ter and music , and one is alone . It has given me a good idea for a magazine story , but it is so hot in my two by four " that I ca n't write . I will get along somehow , and , if looking will bring me work , I shall get it surely . I read in the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolish girl ! Only twenty-one years old , to ruin herself again for the sake of pretty clothes ! I love pretty clothes , too , and hate to look as if I came out of the ark , as badly as any one I know of ; and I know it must have been a great temptation . But , oh , what a price she paid for them ! October 17 . I am very joyous this evening . I have had a great treat in the form of a letter from . Her letter is always like a little white posy to me . For the last three years I have saved them very carefully , until now I have a beautiful bouquet . Her kindness in writing to me is one of the bright spots in this navy-blue life . It makes me think of a day when I had been in prison only a few weeks , and I was down on my knees scrubbing my part of a long hall . I had been locked for some time in a cell with a dark window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not allowed to look up at any one who passed through the hall , and an officer stood at the end of the corridor watching us . My back was aching , my wrists were sore , my knees throbbed from the unaccustomed position , and I was so filled with rage at my humiliation that I longed to knock the bucket of dirty water over , and then roll in it and scream and yell for sheer relief ? when some one tapped me on the shoulder . I looked up with fear , for thought I was going to be reprimanded , but instead a woman bent over me and handed me one small flower ; and when she smiled I could have kissed her feet , and I felt all the anger die away , and my throat ached , it was so full . It was as if I had stepped into a sanctuary , but could not pray . That woman was , and I worshiped her from that moment . When they locked me in again , I took the flower from my dress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I was given ? one of those things they ca n't take away from us ? sleep ! That is the curious part of it . We suffer all the untold agonies of mind , and then we sleep , and sometimes dream of daisy-fields . But now the situ ? ation is reversed . I sleep and dream that I am back again , and trying to get out . I wake myself up trying to scream , and in those few moments I live all over again the past horror and hopelessness . The very sight of a cot bed turns me sick ? its shape and width suggest so much . I believe I said I was joyous . This does not sound much like it . Still I am . Am so glad to have Henley 's book to browse over at odd moments . October 20 . Thanks for the little photograph . To think that I have been acquainted with myself so long , and did n't really know until now just how I looked ! I shall take your advice and send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please take the blame . You must not pay any attention to what I say in this letter , for I have soared so high to-day that I have ridden on the tip end of a cloud ; and such a sunset ! A blood-red sun in an opal sky , and all reflected in a still river of molten silver . No artist could ever paint it . What an artist God must be ! No two sunsets alike , infinite variety , each succeeding night more beautiful than the last ! I love it , and revel in it , but find words too common and gross to express the beauty of it all . October 23 . At last I have found a place . I am to start work this afternoon at two-thirty , and work until ten o'clock to-night at the munitions factory . This is the place I spoke of to you , and although it is a dump , it will help a great deal at the present time . I can not sit down like Mr. Micawber and wait for something to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand it . It is horribly dirty , I am told , but the money is clean . It is a place of nations , for all sorts of foreign ? ers are working there . It is like having one 's soul hit with a knout to have to go to such a dreary place , away from the sunshine , but we can not have all we like in this life , and I doubt if it would be good for us if we did . Well , I 'm off to help blow up the Ger ? mans ? if I do n't get blown up myself first . Are you still of the same mind about the poems ? I hope so ? oh , so much ! I wish I could thank you in the way I wish .. October 25 . Here I am again . This time I simply had to write to you to tell you what I am up against . Before I went to the new job , which is making shells for the British Government , I heard reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be demolished some time this week . I could n't make up my mind which was worse ? being blown up by dynamite or being blown up by an irate landlady ! But I went in at half-past two . Ye gods ! What a place ! No brains are necessary , just brawn . We work seven and a half hours , with fifteen minutes for lunch ! . . . Every moment , at some unexpected noise , the girls will scream , and all lights outside are kept burning , and an extra force of guards patrols the building . The war never seemed so real . It is like working on the top of a rum ? bling volcano . The accommodations for the women are indescribable , and this in cultured Massachusetts . The firm holds back three days from my pay , which is an ? other bad feature . The only good feature about the whole affair is that if I do get blown up , my remains will be so scattered that my loving family will he spared the expense of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the odors are some ? thing weird . However , one must live , and as long as there are no other places for girls , some one is ever ready to take the risk , like Yours sincerely , . . . The munition work goes merrily on , and each night I discover some new noise to add to the torture . All the sins I ever committed really should be washed from the slate , for this work is penance . When you step into that filthy place , reeking of lard oil , and the bell rings that starts that long line all work ? ing together like a machine , I feel like hammering on the closed door and get ? ting out somehow ; but then the hot wave of anger gradually dies when you wonder how long it would be before you found another place , and you feel rather ashamed that you have rebelled even inwardly at conditions that seem to your co-workers perfectly satisfactory . Ah , the man that wrote " Where igno ? rance is bliss " knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me had half a chicken for her lunch yesterday , and she confided in me , saying that " the guy she was keeping company with knew the chef at the Hotel , who swiped half a broiled chicken for him every once in a while , and her steady passed it along to her . " That poor chicken ! What travels ! Where he might have been served on . a silver plat ? ter to some fastidious guest , he is instead toted around in the " steady 's " pocket , to end ignominiously as the piece de resistance of a cold lunch in a munitions factory . That chicken must have led a very sinful life , brief as it was , to have to suffer such a fate . Thanks be that to-day is Friday , for I detest night work , and I am next door to being broke , which of late seems to be a chronic state with me . I figured up last week and found that I spent more for car-fares and accessories than I did for what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall be all right . Next Wednesday I shall be able to eat properly . Did I thank you for all your trouble ? No , I never do . It makes me sort of ache , you are so good to me . Why is it ? I have often wanted to ask you , but hesitate , for fear it might be as I sur ? mised . December 29. writes that she hopes I will some day give up concealment and let my past be known ? " face it publicly , " she says ; and she adds that there is a great buoyancy and strength which comes from it , which kills cheap gossip and strengthens friendships . Very likely she is right . But if I was big enough to face my past , the world is n't big enough to face it ? nor to give me a future . Think how long I would last in a place if my employer knew . Even if the head of a firm knew , and kept me , others would get together and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and money behind them can afford to walk erect ? as I wish I could do . No matter how short the sentence , your time is never done until your name as erased from the book of Life . You go through the door of the great prison , and you say , " I am free . " But you lie to yourself ! For in the sight of man , when he knows , you are two persons ? the person you are to-day , and the per ? son you were . It does n't make any difference how honest you may be you are not to be trusted . And so you find , in time , that you lack confidence in yourself . And always at your elbow stalks fear . You even dream about it . When a prisoner has been told just what to do for nearlytwo years , when every movement has been directed by an officer , she becomes accustomed to it , and becomes a sort of machine , and when she goes out into the world she is left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take the initiative , and it is a great while before she dares to take that liberty again . Then the look ! Did I ever tell you that when a person stops in the middle of a conversation and looks at me stead ? ily , or when I find a person looking at me whom I do n't know , I grow cold ? My brain hammers out , " They know , " and when an unkind word is said , or some one slights me , the S. 0 . S. signals , " They know . " If it was not for my mother , I would stand up to some of these holier-than-thou people and say , " Yes , it is so . " But my mother is old , and I ca n't rob her of her dearest pos ? session , Pride . How did this all start ? Oh yes ; ' s letter . Well , you see I am moody to-night . That wonderful cour ? age you have spoken of is gone . I am sick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the fact that the woman down-stairs has departed and taken her cat with her . And sometimes I felt sure that that cat liked me . I bore you ? I know it ; I bore myself .
