In his second note to Germany , dated October 14 , the President through Mr. Lansing made four demands upon Germany . They were these : First , that " the process of evacuation and the conditions of an armistice " must be left to the " military advisers " of the United States and the Allies ; second , that Germany cease at once to sink passenger ships and to shell life-boats at sea land abandon also her inhuman and barbarous practices on land ; third , a demand to know whether the arbitrary power which has heretofore controlled the German nation has been " reduced to virtual impotency " even if it " can not be presently destroyed " ; fourth , it was indispensable also that the United States and the Allied governments " should know beyond a peradventure with whom they are dealing . " To this the German reply of October 20 is , for the Germans , unusually clear-cut and straightforward . It accepts without reservation the demand that the procedure of evacuation " be left to the judgment of the military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of the contending armies  --  just as President Wilson demanded . Second , Germany abandons completely the " unlimited U-boat warfare " which brought the United States into the war by ordering its U-boats , as rapidly as they can be reached , to cease sinking passenger-vessels ; and offers to submit to neutral judgment the charges of illegal acts of its soldiers and sailors . Third , the German Secretary of Foreign Affairs replies that ( a ) the present German Government 's first act was to lay before the Reichstag " a bill to alter the Constitution of the Empire so that the consent of the representatives of the people is required for decisions on war and peace " ; ( b ) that the responsibility of the Chancellor to the " representation of the people " ( the Reichstag ) is being legally developed and safeguarded ; ( e ) that the leaders of the great parties of the Reichstag are members of the Government ; ( d ) that " in the future no Government can take or continue in office without possessing the confidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new system being further guaranteed " by the unshakable determination of the German people whose vast majority stands behind these reforms and demands their energetic continuance . " Fourth , Mr. Wilson 's question as to whom he is dealing with is " therefore answered in a clear , unequivocal manner " by the statement " that the offer of peace and an armistice has come from a Government which is free from any arbitrary and irresponsible influence . " To the Nation this reply seems as complete , as straightforward , and as final as any one who desires to be fair could possibly ask , and the more because of the comparative vagueness of the President 's note of October 14 . We hear , of course , the familiar chorus of denunciation from both our daily press and our public men . From them we learn that it is an " awkward and clumsy effort " to comply with the President 's demands , and , according to the New York Sun , while appearing " to be an acceptance of the conditions " it " has aroused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " tone of the note " which is resented , " particularly the denial made by Germany that she is guilty of the crimes alleged ; " and the result is a " unanimous demand for unconditional surrender , " no matter what England or France or the President may say . The Times thinks , per contra , that the Germans have confessed to brutal savagery  --  but " not gracefully or like a penitent . " Some ofthe other descriptive terms applied to the note are " falseness , " " colored with deceptions and hypocrisies , " " preposterous , " " amusing , " " mendacious , " " gratifying , " " cunning , " " shrewd , " " ingenious , " " subtle , " " clever , " " plausible , " " lacking in humor , " " impertinent , " etc. , etc . Yet , despite the Sun 's dispatch , there are not lacking voices to say that this note meets the situation . Thus Senator Harding , a Republican , declares that if this note tells the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creation of a responsible Government is concerned . " Senator Overman , a Democrat , says : " As I read the note , it looks as if Germany had surrendered to our terms and was willing to do anything to end the war . " But the bulk of the comment is a demand to brush aside all of the President 's negotiations and to insist upon an unconditional surrender dictated in Berlin . Senator Poindexter goes so far , by way of supporting our Chief Executive , as to say that the President should be impeached if he even " answers this note and undertakes to agree with Germany on the basis of it before her army is conquered and disarmed . " With Germany standing squarely upon the President 's fourteen peace terms , with the cessation of the criminal U-boat warfare upon passenger vessels , with the steady withdrawal of German troops from all the occupied territories , with the evidence given of the reconstruction of the German Government , peace is plainly within our grasp . " It the note will mean the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want to accept it that way . " But if we do not wish it that way after Mr. Wilson 's negotiations , after the repeated assurance given to Germany here and abroad that acceptance of the fourteen peace terms would give peace , then the moral advantage of the United States and the Allies will pass away , the war will degenerate into one of revenge , and the German people , conscious of having made truly reasonable replies to the demands of President Wilson , will be fortified to a determined resistance upon their own boundaries . All the lies that German statesmen have told hitherto as to this being a war of defence against aggression will seem to become truths . A very high authority has recently declared that to carry the war to Berlin would mean three more years of fighting and the loss of millions of lives ; but even this would be as nothing compared with the breach of faith involved if the Poindexters have their way , if we are to be lured into further terrible sacrifice by the spell of phrases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batter our way to Berlin at frightful cost if Berlin comes to us , and upon its knees ? If there are still things to be cleared up ; fresh proofs of good faith still to be asked ; if , for example , we are going to insist upon the abdication of the Kaiser , let us ask it in the clearest of language . But our national honor demands that we do not now disown everything that the President has done , throw him overboard , and fight on whether the Germans conform to fourteen peace terms or forty . It is a genuine crisis in the life of the Republic , and there is but one ground on which all liberals and democrats can stand . That is by the side of the President , lest he be unable to maintain the position he has taken as leader of the liberal forces of the world . It is true that in his reply to Austria he abandoned one of his fourteen peace terms ; it is true that he has been at times vague and inconsistent . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Mr. Wilson . The hour for peace has come ; shall it be allowed to pass unused ? The Way of Peace WHILE Senator Lodge and Mr. Roosevelt have been achieving notoriety abroad by their demand for unconditional surrender and war to the bitter end , significant indications of doubt or dissent have been cropping out in unexpected quarters . The New York World , which has certainly not been lax in supporting the war , bluntly asks " how many of the Americans who are shouting for ' unconditional surrender ' know the meaning of the words they use , " and deplores the demand as " thoughtless and irresponsible . " Mr. Taft , who stands for unconditional surrender , nevertheless writes in the Philadelphia Public Ledger that Mr. Wilson 's fourteen points are " very general , " and declares that it will be " a negotiated peace , " and one " depending on the honor of the Hohenzollerns for its maintenance . " Professor J. Holland Rose of Cambridge University , one of the most distinguished of English authorities on modern history and international relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tide of events has swept on " since the fourteen points were drawn up , and that they do not fully cover the questions to be dealt with ; while the Hon. Leslie M. Shaw , formerly Secretary of the Treasury , comes forward with an offer of $500 " to any reputable international lawyer " who shall give him " in terse and definite form the legal meaning of each of the fourteen points . " What Senator Lodge , Mr. Roosevelt , and the assertive advocates of unconditional surrender are doing is , of course , to urge the adoption of a Junker programme . It is a curious fact that the United States , having gone to war to abolish militarism and the rule of force , and with solemn declaration of its purpose to make the world safe , not for armies , but for democracy , should now be urged by Republican leaders to spurn all offers of peace in advance , overrun Germany with its armies , and dictate the terms of settlement at Berlin . This is Junkerism and militarism of the most approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by talk about freeing Europe from oppression , its spirit and method are essentially at one with those of the Kaiser and his supporters . With such a programme , discussion is of course quite out of the question ; the peace for which the world yearns , the political freedom which Americans have believed was somehow the birthright of all mankind , is to be achieved only by smashing through to Berlin . It is much to be regretted that Senator Lodge , in outlining the terms of peace which a military victory is to obtain , should not have been more explicit regarding the two main points . It is all well enough to talk about dismembering Austria , or adding to the territory of Italy , or driving the Turk out of Europe , or restoring Alsace-Lorraine . All these are complicated questions , it must be admitted ; and they are very much more complicated than they were when the war broke out because of the positions which the Allies and the United States have taken with reference to the Jugoslays , the Czecho-Slovaks , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What does Senator Lodge propose to do with Germany ? Assuming that the German armies have been destroyed , the country occupied by an Allied and American force , and the Imperial Government helpless , what next ? Is the Kaiser to be deposed , or the Empire destroyed or broken up , or the Reichstag remodelled ? If so , how is the thing to be done ? If Germany is to be parcelled outamong its enemies , how are the shares to be apportioned ? If it is to be preserved as a State , precisely how does Sen. ator Lodge propose to reform it ? This is one of the chief points . The other is Russia . " What is the American policy with respect to Russia ? " the ' New York Globe asked the other day . " No one seems to know . . . . Our Government seems unable to make up its mind . . . . There is the most painful evidence of lack of stability of view . " After a year of revolution , the Administration has not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose authenticity rests under grave doubt . It seizes and segregates the papers of various persons who know Russia from the inside , and interferes with newspapers which champion the cause of the Soviet Government . It continues to recognize Mr. Bakhmetiev as Russian Ambassador , although we suspect that Secretary Lansing would be puzzled to determine what Government Mr. Bakhmetiev represents . In spite of the fact that nobody is at war with Russia , the troops of half a dozen nations are carrying on military operatiens in Russia and fighting pitched battles with the Soviet troops . One searches in vain in the threatenings and slaughters of the Republican Junkers to find how they propose to deal with this anomalous situation . If Senator Lodge and Mr. Roosevelt really desire to help the country which they have served in high places these many years , they will take a different tack . They will cease trying to force the Administration to adopt the role of a Prussian Junkerdom , and address themselves to a study of the real problems involved in the negotiation of a peace . We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems were never graver than they are at this moment . Nothing more than a reading of the English and French newspapers is needed to make clear that England is seething with labor disturbance , and France with political and Socialist agitation . A greater menace to the established order them Prussianism has grown great on the horizon , and that is Bolshevism . Only the other day Lord Milner , the British Secretary of State for War , declared in an interview that an armistice , if it guaranteed the military supremacy of the Allies , ought by all means to be attained if possiMe , and warned the Allies that an attempt at the present time to dictate drastic changes in the German Constitution would stiffen the resistance of the German armies . We venture to think that there are three things which Mr. Wilson can do to help the present dangerous situation . The first is to come out with all his might against the Junkers , whatever their party affiliations , who are trying to force his hand . He will find the people with him when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask the Soviet Government to say , clearly and fully , what it wants from the United States and the Allies , and , in particular , what it proposes to do with the Russian debt . The large holdings of Russian securities in France give that country a peculiarly vital interest in the future of Russia , and if the question can be cleared of its present uncertainty and apprehension , a material obstacle to peace will , we believe , have been removed . The third thing is to recognize the gravity of the social situation in every European country , and to take a few steps towards meeting Germany at the peace table before the great war shall have had time to become a war of revolution . Perhaps we shall soon hear that the good offices of Colonel House are being used in furtherance of these ends . Military Demobilization ONE of the wonders of the American Civil War , espe-ON to foreign observers , was the way in which the Union armies , after four years of war , were quietly disbanded and the soldiers returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished without disturbance , without serious dislocation of industry , and without any notable increase in the number of the unemployed . The achievement was the more notable because the Federal Government , notwithstanding the great expansion of its powers which had taken place during the war , had exercised no such widespread and exclusive control of the national life as it has exercised during the present war , and had developed no such elaborate administrative machinery as is now available for great national tasks . All that was done was , in substance , to discharge the soldiers and send them home ; what became of them afterwards was a matter which the Government left the soldiers to manage largely for themselves . Nothing quite so simple is to be looked forward to at the close of the present war . The conditions to be met are more varied and complicated than those of 1865 . First in importance is the question of transport . The larger part of the American army , aggregating several million men , will be overseas ; and to the fighting men are to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , non-combatant members of the army , and volunteer workers . The demobilization of this great force involves not only an elaborate system of official records , but the transportation back across the ocean from all parts of the world of these millions of men and women , and adequate provision of food , shelter , oversight , and railway transportation in this country . The success with which American soldiers have been sent across the Atlantic at a rate of 250,000 or more a month has properly challenged admiration ; but so high a rate of return transit is hardly probable after the peace . For one thing , the homeward movement of troops will coincide with the renewal of foreign trade and of foreign travel ; and in the face of the extraordinary demand for tonnage to meet both freight and passenger needs , the transport of the army may have to take second place . Tonnage congestion will also be increased by the fact that British ships , which have carried 60 per cent . of our troops to Europe , will be needed at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process is certain to be a long one . Even if the American army is returned to this country at the rate of 50,000 a week  --  a figure , we believe , greatly in excess of what it will be possible to attain  --  the return of 3,000,000 men will extend over fourteen months . To put the case in another way , if peace were declared to-day . and demobilization were begun to-morrow , the last of the American army would not have reached the United States until the end of December , 1919 . Demobilization , accordingly , involves a provision for employing the troops abroad between the time when hostilities cease and the time when they take ship for home . Perhaps they can be usjed in the physical restoration of devastated France or wasted Belgium  --  a graceful international service which may well receive consideration . The same careful , detailed planning for the soldier 's welfare will be required in the period between his landing in this country and his arrival at his home . At what point is membership in the army actually to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the soldiers reach America , thenthe dumping at the Atlantic and Pacific seaports of thousands of men a week , for more than a year , each man seeking food , lodging , civilian clothing , employment , or railway transportation , would certainly produce indescribable confusion ; the soldier would become a social danger . If , on the other hand , the actual disbandment of the army is to be deferred until after the men have returned , it will be necessary not ' only to maintain the present military camps at their maximum efficiency , but also to begin discharging the men at once in order to prevent the camps from becoming overcrowded . In the meantime , the men who have not been sent abroad , but who remain , to the number of some hundreds of thousands , in the camps at home , will also have to be demobilized as rapidly as possible to make room for the steady stream of arrivals from overseas . All this merely shows how difficult and important , even on its mechanical or administrative side , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question for more than a year and a half , and only a few weeks ago actually carried through a rehearsal of the prospective process to learn how it would work . No time should be lost in formulating an equally detailed and comprehensive scheme in this country . Once the war is over the demand for the speedy return of the army to civil life will be irresistible , and the Government should be ready to meet it . Only in part is it a question for the War Department ; the Ship- ? ping Board , the Railway Administration , the Red Cross , and a long list of other governmental or quasi-governmental agencies are concerned in it . It would be a disgrace if , after having successfully mobilized an army during the war , we should fail to demobilize it successfully after the peace . A Revolution in Sailoring It makes the reader of sea-lore rub his eyes to learn from a recent issue of the Nautical Gazette something about the officers ' quarters on the new cargo ships which our country is building . Each captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine bed-room , in some cases with a brass bed ( ! ) and a private bathroom with a real porcelain tub . Shades of Marryat ! One turns instinctively to his description of the quarters in which midshipmen used to be trained for His Majesty 's quarter-decks : A small hole they called a berth ; it was ten feet long by six and about five feet four inches high ; a small aperture about nine inches square admitted a very scanty portion of what we most needed , namely , fresh air and daylight . . . . Most of my new associates were absent on duty ; the ' tween decks was crammed with casks and cases and chests and bags and hammocks ; the noise of the calkers was resumed over my head and all around me ; the stench of bilge water , combining with the smoke of tobacco , the effluvia of gin and beer , the frying of beefsteaks and onions and red herrings  --  the pressure of a dark atmosphere and a heavy shower of rain , all conspired to oppress my spirits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not even the captain 's room of a frigate on which the youngest officers lived in such kennels could compare with the state-rooms which the junior officers are to have on our new ships . Thus , the first mate will have a room twelve feet square with a private bath instead of " bunking in " with the second mate in a cabin six feet by five . Each mate and each engineer is to have a state-room of his own , and the officers have a bright and cheerful dining saloon " finished in oak or some other hard wood , varnished , haying a sideboard , leather-upholstered chairs , and lockers . " In the lot of the common seaman , too , a wonderful transformation is to take place . The foc'sle of a lime-juicer in the old days differed little from the Black Hole of Calcutta . In bad weather it was an indescribable place in which men lived , ate , slept , and sometimes died . Wet clothes were the rule ; the exhausted watches tumbled into their bunks for four or eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear ship . Bathing was unknown ; fresh air impossible ; everything damp , soggy , foul , and reeking , and the men glad enough if they could get a hot meal once in twenty-four hours . Dana described it at its best in his " Two Years Before the Mast " : The steerage in which I lived was filled with coils of rigging , spare sails , old junk and ship stores , which had not been stowed away . Moreover , there had been no berths built for us to sleep in and we were not allowed to drive nails to hang our clothes upon . The sea , too , had risen , the vessel was rolling heavily , and everything was pitched about in grand confusion . . . . A large hawser had been coiled away upon my chest ; my hats , boots , mattress and blankets had all fetched away and gone over to leeward , and were jammed and broken under the boxes and coils of rigging . To crown all , we were allowed no light to 2nd anything with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been found to go to sea at all , for conditions on the tramp steamers that succeeded the little brig which did so much of the world 's work in Dana 's day have been little better than those on sailing vessels . The Shipping Board is doing the right thing in abolishing the forecastle and in providing a separate mess room , state-rooms holding four men each , adequate toilets and shower-baths , with steel lockers , electric light , and most wonderful of all , the same food for men as for officers . Our men ought to live like human beings and not like animals . If the provision of these " luxuries " means that we shall not be able to compete with foreign ships , then let us not compete . Andrew Furuseth and other leaders are right ; there must be a new day for the sailor , and his heroism in this war shows that he is worthy of it . Literatulte may perhaps lose by the change , for picturesqueness and dramatic quality will go . A future Jack London writing of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The burly Norse captain never seemed more gigantic nor more terribly brutal as he fell upon his prey and dragged him by the hair of his head from the sailor 's . shower-room where he was in the act of giving himself a facial massage with an electric vibrator . Yanking him through the sailors ' mess room , he overturned in his wrath the victrola , the magazine table , and the bookcase . " There will be no chance for another Dana , just as no modern Marryat can possibly put romance into one of our modern cruisers , unless he writes of an ocean raider like the " Emden " in order to chronicle adventure extraordinary . But whatever literature loses , the sea gains . It is no joking matter , for the most difficult problem of our future sea power , when the war ends and finds us with the largest modern mercantile fleet on our hands , will be the question of how to man it . The United States competed successfully with all the world when clippers were costly ships and the crews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can compete successfully again , and that one of the best ways of competing will be to give to our seamen , not luxuries , but the necessary comforts and decencies of life which workers everywhere are learning to expect , whether on sea or land . Wrappage 1 , 17 E received the other day a packet of books that had escaped the submarine . It was heavily protected by many layers of printed sheets . Opening such a packet is no ordinary matter : war-marks and cabalistic numerals of various sorts must be gravely studied , the amount of insurance and postage calculated , the album value of stamps guessed at for the young , and the twine carefully unknotted for the string-basket . Only then may the coverings be removed from the precious books , with their salty , tarry smell that lingers between the leaves long after the volumes have ceased to be a novelty upon the shelves . That smell carries us back to undergraduate days , when we were fond of prowling about the docks and the gloomy , uneven , and threatening warehouses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , up through gratings of silent buildings , came the same odor that we now get only in our most treasured books . Grain elevators , coal-yards , and lumber-piles were uninteresting , for their contents savored of the interior of the country ; but tar , rope , great chains and hawsers , anchors , and capstans were made for the sea . The by-streets where sailors loafed , and where brass and copper instruments for navigation haunted our fancy , are now covered by great blocks of concrete and odorless buildings ; but even modern commerce has not removed the smell of " naval stores " from the heart of a ship , and so our books come filled with the pervasive odor that only in these rare cases comes to enrich the lives of those who do not go down to the sea in ships . The wrappage is off , but it is not lightly discarded . For here , instead of discordant sheets of waste paper , are folds of page-proof of a book , just as they came off the press  --  an octavo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with footnotes only less inviting than the text . What futility to write a book , and then to correct galley and page-proof , merely to produce wrappage for books printed three and four hundred years ago ! We read the sheets to see what manner of book has thus apparently been still-born . Our guess was right ; the book was about theology . It did not even deal with historical facts or the documents from which theology has grown ; it was made up of the writer 's opinions about opinions . He had wound his notions into some sort of metaphysical system , spirally mounting into a limbo of unreality unto which no one but he could or would attain . Pedantry makes good wrappage . Better protect our treasures with it than drop it into an old stump for slugs and newts to devour , or , with the poet , to let it " dry-rot till the judgment-day . " How much pedantry , we wonder , has gone to the bottom of the sea since the war began ; not as wrappage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to encumber valued shelf-space in colleges and universities ? Leipzig book manufactories were the largest in the world ; Germany has given us not only a thing that was not wholly without use , but also the picturesque name for it  --  abfahrendes Beispiel , an example of how not to do it . Many a man ha &; determined to be simple and clear at all hazards after having mastered a monument of German pedantry and obfuscation . With all that we have learned from Germany , we have still to appraise its intellectual wrappage , its tons of page-proof , corrected , bound , and delivered , serving at best as some protection to unsuspected treasures within .
