txt Taking Movies . As a brother director of motion pictures . I would like to be Permitted to say a Word in reply to the letter from Ashley Miller . I strenuously object to his assertion that general discourtesy Is shown by artists and directors to the ladies and gentlemen who so kindly give the use of their grounds for motion picture purposes . There may be one or two Isolated eases , of the abuse of such kindness , but I for one . am quite sure that it Is not general . I have had the privilege of taking pictures on some of the finest estates In this country and in France and England , and I have ' never seen anything such as Mr. Miller depicts . It would seem to me that Mr. Milller 's suggestion that a Directors ' Mutual Defense League be formed for the preservation of beautiful estates has about it a touch of the ludicrous.
