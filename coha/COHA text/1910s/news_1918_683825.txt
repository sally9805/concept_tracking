txt HIGH FRENCH MORALE . Praise for the Spirit of the Soldiers and the Women . I inclose a copy of a letter just received from my father , President William II . Crawford of Allegheny College , who has been with the Y. M. C. A. in France since December . JOHN R. CRAWFORD , Librarian Avery Library . Columbia University , April 2 , 1918 . Inclosure . Somewhere in France , March 13 , 1918 . Dear  - -  -  : ? ? ? On Sunday I think I saw at least 10,000 French soldiers . The thing that pleases me most is their spirit . Many of them are tired and wish the war was over , but they have no thought of giving up . They look well and have their toes in the ground . Their physical fitness is far beyond what I expected . This is true of both officers and men . Yesterday I stood alongside a lot of them who had been . only ten minutes out of the trenches . ? ? ? My hat is off nearly all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of France for what they are doing . I saw so many of them in the fields yesterday . They ought to have a secure place among the world 's heroines . Do n't be feeling , though , that France is being bled white . She is not . France is heroically determined , if not triumphant . There seems absolute confidence in this region that the line will hold . I think I have seen a thousand miles of trenches in the last ten days and as much barbed wire entanglement . The Germans have nothing on us as to gas . It . is commonly reported here that they want to give up the whole gas business . A Decision on Amendment Votes . To the Editor of The New York Times : In your issue of March 31 A. L. Shepard submits a plan for testing before the Supromo Court the validity of the recent submission by Congress of the prohibition amendment , and argues that my previous letter , showing that several of the existing amendments received less than a two-thirds vote or the members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of the constitutional requirement as to size of vote in the two houses . I believe that moat persons would agree with Mr. Shepard 's statement that " no interpretation by Congress of the meaning of terms used in the Constitution is binding on the United States Supreme Court . " On the other hand , in the absence of an explicit constitutional requirement of two-thirds of the members of the respective houses , it seems certain that the Supreme Court would be , though not technically bound , yet actually influenced , by the previous interpretations and practices of Congress with respect to amendments which have been a part of our Constitution for so many years . The method suggested by Mr. Shepard for securing a Supreme Court decision sustaining his contention on the point seems hopeless . The purpose of my previous letter was to suggest that it is futile for opponents of prohibition to contest its adoption by any such cumbersome procedure . If there are not stronger and more practical objections to national prohibition , the proposal for such an amendment would in any event soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's interpretetien : FRANCIS W. COKER . New Haven , Conn. , ' April 1 , 1918 . Attention for Sick Soldiers . To the Editor of The New York Times : I read " Doctors and the Line , " by " A Line Officer , " in Saturday 's issue . There is one statement he makes which should not be allowed to stand unchallenged . He states that a soldier in. need of medical attention must wait for the hour sot for the treatment of such cases . This is not true . I am sure this officer did not Intend to misstate , but Iris assertion Is both misleading and harmful . A soldier taken sick will get attention day or night if ho asks for it and his noncommissioned officer or officers attend to duty . The assertion that he must wait for sick call is absurd . The Medical Corps may have its shortcomings , but one hopeful fact remains . that lino officers who have had actual experience on the firing line do not " knock " it . A DOCTOR . Cambridge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To the Editor of The New York Times : We want results . Democrats and Republicans in Congress as a whole are not working together on vital war problems . Bad blood is being stirred , ugly passions unloosed when there should be perteet ' eatuworlt . Should we have a coalition Government ? Is party government best at this time ? Should President Wilson take the initiative ? Why not see General Wood at the While louse ? IN'hy not consult with Senator Chamherlaht rather than drift into an ugly row ? ' What would Lincoln have done ? What the people want is to win this war for " righteousness and lasting peace .

" To the Editor of The New York Times : I can not refrain from eXpressIng gratification . which I am sure must be shared by all Englishmen ( and women ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tribute paid to my country in this time of sore trial in the beautiful and stately poem by Herman Montagu Donner. entitled . " Faithful Albion , " in this morning 's TIMECS . In its simple yet dignified lines there Is the deep emotional strain which forms -- -and must form  - -  - the true basin of every great poem . It will , I am sure , hearten every English bosom , as it has mine , to beer the anxious strain of these days of barrowing suspense , and I am truly grateful to the author of the poem as well Pa to you for pnto.ttog , GREYSON . New York , March 27 , 191 ' 4. - ?  --   - -  A Day of Grace . To the Editor of The NeW York Times : It is said that while the light burns the sinner may return .
