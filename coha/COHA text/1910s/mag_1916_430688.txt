THEY have a name in Hawaii for such as we malihinis , newcomers ? in contrast to the Island-born or the Island-bred , the " old-timers , " who are kamaainas . In any account of foreign places not purely aesthetic and sensuous there should be a residuum of confessed ignorance . The foreigners that drift to usward on fickle wing , then write books longer than their total sojourn with us , are our malihinis ; and we all know with what seas-full of salt we take their account of America . A traveller must flatter himself that his eyes have caught the truth , or for very shame he could not write . But we malihinis of a month must have inevitably , in the background of our minds , the patient , quizzical smile of the kamaaina . The malihini 's dearest hope is not to turn that smile to a frown . This , as of obligation , from one who has but passed , to those whose roots have struck deep in the gentlest soil of earth . . . . To most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have never contemplated going there long enough to get up a Hawaiian dossier , the name of Honolulu suggests , perhaps , half a dozen things : sugar , surf-riding , volcanoes , leis , missionaries , and poi . I doubt , at all events , if the list is much larger ; and I am not sure that to include both leis and poi is not to be too generous . I am not speaking of sophisticated creatures on the " Coast " who , whether or not they have run " down " to Honolulu them Copyright , 1916 , by Charles Scribner 's Sons . All rights reserved .  |p518  selves , can be glib about friends who have run " down . " Certainly we knew originally little more than the list suggests . But knowledge somehow bursts upon one when one is contemplating a specific journey : the detached air of the steamship clerk and the railway agent breed in one a kind of knowingness . Long before we saw Diamond Head we had made a hundred traveller 's choices , and could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made out not only that Honolulu was the tourist 's paradise ? our luggage-labels said so ? but also that it was a paradise with a grievance . Free sugar , the seaman 's bill , the prevailingly yellow tinge of the population , and the perishing Kanaka , were all familiar formulae before a single maile wreath had been flung about our necks . There were Island people on the steamer ; and wherever Island people are met together , to pass the time or to instruct the stranger , Island problems are hot in the mouth . To talk about the insularity of an island is to be tautological ; but the insular American on Oahu is more insular , so to speak , than the insular Englishman in London . England is the centre of an empire ; but Hawaii is the mere outpost of a republic : a Territory , something as helpless in the hands of Congress as a ward in chancery is helpless ; bent therefore on self-preservation solely , and on keeping up its own little state and luxury in its own little midPacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War " ? not as we of the East understand interest : their newspapers confess it . Very few of them are interested even in a possible Japanese complication ; Mexico is as naught to them . So far , they but accentuate the general indifference ( excepting always California 's anti-Japanese frenzy ) of the States west of the Mississippi . Though the Islands look so Oriental , they are in many ways Western of the Western . Not only are they not internationally minded ; they are not even nationally minded . They are almost more " sectional " than the " solid " South or the State of Utah . Life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness , for the Islander , are bound up in sugar . Hine Rice lacrimce . Yes , the grievances of this paradise stir one to wrath on the steamer ? though they sink into the background after one lands and the pleasures of the eye are pre-eminent . Except , that is , as the grievances touch one personally . The coastwise shipping law touched us nearly : thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could not stay to see Kauai . It is maddening to see good Japanese boats steam out half-empty , and to be restricted ? now that the Pacific Mail steamers have had to stop business ? to one overcrowded line . The mysteries of sugar , in all their detail , I could not hope to penetrate ; though I thought it quite clear at the time that Hawaii can not compete with Cuba . Thence resulted a wry-mouthed admiration of our doctrinaire democracy . Is it not like us ( one asks with tearful pride ) to fight Spain for Cuban freedom , and to crown that activity by presenting Cuba with the world 's market for cane-sugar , destroying our domestic industries ? The war is temporarily keeping the Hawaiian canefields from tragic fallowness ; but free sugar may well outlast the war . Let no man say we are not altruistic . " The gray beard of Uncle Sam " ( I scribbled frantically with Honolulu harbor spread prismatically before my eyes ) " is as wild in the air as ever Don Quixote 's . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real comfort to the chauvinist . There is no Yellow Peril . They begin saying it a little past the Farralones , and they are still saying it when the rosy pallor of Diamond Head first takes your breath away at dawn . Then you drift into waters that are like the harbors of a sunset sky ; the more acrid chapter of preconception ends , while the sweeter one of experience begins . Hawaii is a melting-pot : that is the first thing , perhaps , to strike one , humanly speaking . The strictly Polynesian effect lurks rather in the air , the foliages the sky and the sea : the ever delightful , never conventional decor of the Pacific island . True , you find , now and then , tucked away under its coco-palms on thunderous shores , a Hawaiian village all complete with its taro-patches , its fish-nets , its outrigger canoes drawn up on the sand , its lazy life , and its innocence of English . But you have now to  |p520  go far afield for such . The bulk of the Island population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as against some 24,000 Hawaiians and an equal number of " all Caucasians . " Then come Portuguese ( not reckoned as Caucasians ) and Chinese , nearly even in the census lists - 23,000 and 21,000 , respectively . PartHawaiians ( a motley breed ! ) and Filipinos pair , farther down , with some 14 , - 000 each . There are a few thousand each of Porto Ricans , Spanish , and " all others . " Yet this melting-pot is not depressing , like that which you get the full sense of , say , on lower Fifth Avenue at noon . In Hawaii , save for a few Russian peasants , there are no Slays ; there are no Jews ; there are virtually no negroes ; there is no Levantine scum . The Mediterranean coast , from Gibraltar to Sicily , from Sicily to Jaffa and Crete and Constantinople , is unrepresented ; Central Europe and the Balkans have sent nothing . No Ruthenians , no Slovaks , no Lithuanians , no Armenians , no Huns . A few Greek hotel-keepers serve to make life tolerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly count . Even in Honolulu the white man is in a visual minority ; and outside Honolulu nearly all the faces are yellow or brown . The Hawaiian meltingpot at first is picturesque ; it ends by being lovable ? and being missed . Even the pessimist may find comfort in the fact that the Oriental has no vote . The fat babies in rainbow kimonos will have them ; but that story is for another day . The Anglo-Saxon is still dominant . The Hawaiian has the ballot ? and in consequence the Hawaiian vote is the largest in the Islands ? but his vote will pass with his existence ; which means that he will not long trouble the polls . Civilization has killed him , as is its way : vice and disease came in with the sea-captains and sailors of all the globe , and the missionaries finished the work . As far as one can make out , the missionaries were more responsible than Captain Cook or the New Bedford whalers , for the Kanaka is dying , quite literally , of clothes . Tuberculosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in far the largest numbers . The race is not weak or degenerate : it is , physically , magnificent in strength and beautiful of feature . But the Kanaka is amphibious ? fishing , surfriding , swimming , he is , all his life , naturally in and out of the water . It is one thing to cover yourself with palm-oil and let the Pacific spray run off you in shining drops while you rest on the sands ; it is quite another to keep your wet clothes on as you go about your business on the shore ? but it is to ask too much of Polynesian intelligence to request it to see the difference . If clothes are good , they are good , wet or dry . If you do not yourself perceive the initial beauty of clothes , you can not be very sophisticated about their uses . The Kanaka is not up to Sartor Resartus . That the Polynesian has never employed his keen aesthetic sense on the matter of dress is proved , I think , by the fact that the native women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gown which the most tasteless Puritan could not condemn . Tradition says that the first missionary ladies , in mad haste to dress their converts , handed over the patterns of their own nightgowns . A race ( I submit ) that has stuck faithfully for nearly a hundred years to the model of our great-grandmothers ' nightdresses ? for " best " as well as for every day ? is a docile , an admirable , a lovable race , which " vaunteth not itself and is not puffed up . " It is almost a pity , too , hygienically speaking , that the grass house has become unfashionable . It is engaging of the Kanaka to build himself a wooden shack to live in because white men live in wooden houses and provide such for their laborers ; but there is nothing particularly amiable in opening your windows at night , and , since his fine tact is all social and not in the least scientific , he does not open them . The grass house ventilated itself , and the wooden shack does not . Hence more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang leis about their necks , and all the men wear flowerwreaths round their junk-shop American hats . To the charm ancestrally perceived they are faithful ; but they have never learned to improve on Caucasian ideas . They have accepted the brutal fact of clothes , just as they Christianized themselves en masse ; they have accepted the silly American standard of the wooden house . But you must not expect them ?  |p521  to go farther : you must not expect them to like to work , or to care how their foolish clothes look ( if we were made to wear barrels , I dare say we should feel a like indifference to fashions in hoops and staves ) , or to think about cubic feet of air . It works the same way , I fancy , with religion . " They say what they think will please you , " was the report of a kamaaina who came of the old missionary stock and who had worked much among Hawaiians . Of course they do : they are polite to the death ? literally . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the missionaries arrived ; and when the missionaries came , the Hawaiians embraced Christianity about as simply as France did under Clovis . They are Christians , and have been , now , for some three generations ; but they will not build where there has been a heiau , and their propitiatory offerings to Pele line all the sombre trail to the Sacred Falls of Kaliuwaa . Every kamaaina can give you some authentic tale of some one who has been kahuna-edprayed to death . Officially the kahuna @# is proscribed : there is a price on his head . But the authentic tales are there ; and indeed I have seen lost villages where a kahuna would be very safe from the short arm of the law . Such docility , such unwillingness to be rude , such indifference to the logic of the laws by which the natives must now live , @# do not make for self-preservation . They make for listlessness , for forgetting strenuous traditions , for seizing the day , for making leis , and singing sad and idle muisc by the incomparable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has absorbed them ; they know they are dying , though they do not quite know why ; but they have not enough sternness or stength for the black pessimism that Stevenson recorded among their cousins , the cannibal Marquesans . The old meles and the old hero-tales are nearly fogotten , as are the old hulas . A few aged men and women can still sing and dance in traditional fashion for their aged Queen --  but there is no one to whom they can pass on the words of the songs or the motions of the dance . The new songs are different ? lyrical at best , never epic ; and the new dances might perhaps delight a cabaret , if any cabaret could conceivably be allowed to present them . I have seen a native hula in a country village , in full swing after hours of feasting ; and the muscle-dancing of expositions is innocuous beside it ? though far more disgusting because not spontaneous . The old hulas were different : were stately and , I dare say , a little tiresome , with their monotonous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very old person now can dance in the earlier fashion ; you could easily count up the Hawaiians who know the meles ; and there is just one man , I believe , left on Oahu ( if indeed he is still living ) who can play the nose-flute as it should be played , to the excruciation of every nerve in a Caucasian body . Regular work is almost an impossibility to the Polynesian ; therefore he is seldom , if ever , to be found in the cane or pineapple fields . He is very strong , @#  |p524  and makes an excellent stevedore ; and that employment suits him , for he can leave it and come back to it as he chooses . The ships come in from Australia and the South Seas , from the Orient or round the Horn ; and whenever they come in or go out , there is work a-plenty . Until his money is gone he can exist beautifully , singing to his ukulele and washing down his raw fish and poi with square face . He makes occasionally a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that of policeman . To stand directing traffic at King and Fort Streets , his beautiful poses plastiques legitimized by authority , is as near heaven , I fancy , as a serious-minded Kanaka can get . In Honolulu ? and Honolulu draws to itself , magnet-wise , all the interests and activities of Oahu ? the white man is more in evidence than anywhere else on the Islands . That is natural . It is the social and commercial metropolis , the capital , the traditional home of most of the missionaries , the residence still of the Queen , the centre of military and naval business , the pre-eminent port of the Islands . In Honolulu itself the melt-  | ing-pot seems to seethe most hotly ; for the white man is there in numbers to remind you of the extraordinary foreignness of the other human beings who frequent the streets , ride on the familiar trolley-cars , and pour out of the " movies " at the classic hours . Away from Honolulu you often forget the white man : the tropics beat in on you more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the surf is the surf of the South Seas ; the world is wholly different ; and its very curious and exotic of you yourself to be white . Save for the mental mirror we carry about with us , one would forget one was . But Honolulu is American , very . It is even part of its charm that it should be so ; for there is nothing pathetic , no savor of exile , in the resolute dominance of American ways . The Islanders are not backwardlooking , like ( we are told ) Englishmen in India . Honolulu is " home , " and they look as little to the mainland ( save , now and then , sardonically to Washington ) as the Westerner looks to the Atlantic  |p526  coast . They have not even had to compound with the climate , for the climate is quite simply perfect . They can afford not to seek their greatest comfort ; for , after all , it is impossible to be very uncomfortable . It is the tourist , the visitor , who wears Palm Beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dresses as the business man in New York dresses ? tweeds , starched neck-gear , and all . Most men wear black evening clothes at dinner . A certain amount of white is worn , of course ; but the general impression of the visitor from the temperate zone is that these folk do not live up to their privileges . As for their houses , I should positively hesitate to say how bad Island architecture is , if so quintessential an Islander as Mr. W. R. Castle , Jr. , had not said it before me . Life in Hawaii is lived under the palm and the mango , the banyan and the poinciana , the algaroba and the monkey-pod . The great hibiscus hedges are as high as , in England , the border of ancestral yew ; the night-blooming cereus hangs in multitudinous clusters over your garden-wall ; the scent of ginger is heavy round your lanai ; the orange and the lime bloom in your compound , and the guava runs wild by the wayside ; your yard-boy eats his dinner under a banana-tree . A garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a tropical forest , a gigantic and fragrant gloom . But the houses breathe  |p527  none of all this . They are hardly ever even Southern in type ? low and pillared and wide-verandahed . The architecture of Hawaii is uncompromising ; it is ? for want of a better word , let me say evangelical . It stands rigidly by the worst traditions of the nineteenth century ; it is the same that disfigures our New England streets and stultifies the fine situation of many a Western town . Two stories and sometimes three ; scamped porches set about with jig-saw decoration ; colors that must make the gentle Jap swear ritually as he patters by in his immaculate kimono : the kind of thing that is quaint and endearing in Portland , Oregon , but which , in the full sweetness of the Trade , is simply the Great Refusal . Not much better is the newer house , halftimbered or of tapestry brick ; for if there ever was a place with which the Tudors and their ways and works had nothing to do , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the older houses in the town ; but the released Americans , who go farther up the Manoa or the Nuuanu Valley , do not improve on their ancestral homes . There is melancholy comfort to a monarchically inclined person in the fact that Liliuokalani lives in the loveliest house in Honolulu . Washington Place , which she now inhabits , is of the old Southern type , and it does not insult the vegetation . ( As for the Royal Palace ? now the Executive Building ? I believe I am alone in admiring it . It is of absurdly ornamented type , but so like many a bad minor palace in Europe that it endears itself . The throne-room is just what any petty sovereign would have found fit , and the space and height of the rooms are literally palatial . There is something very fine and aesthetically decent about the sweep of the broad stone galleries , and the slow , lavish curve of the central staircase . Kamehameha 's statue , in bronze and gold , faces the palace majestically across the square ; and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pays homage except an ancient Portuguese lunatic , who spends his life before it . ) Some people have had the wit to build low , shingled bungalows , and they will have Paradise about them when  |p528  they die . But it verily seems as though no sensitive soul could make its peace with God while the poinciana and the banyan look down on tortured clapboarding , built into a high and narrow shape . Were I to cite exceptions ? and of course there are exceptions ? it would be almost like naming names , so I refrain . Nor do I speak of interiors , only of the front presented to the world . But it is a great pity that some young architect with a sense of fitness does not feel " called " to make man 's part in the aspect of Honolulu a little more akin to God 's . The Atlantic States had Georgian memories to help them out ; California has had Spain ; but Hawaii is singularly isolated . The natives , of course , contributed no architectural ideas . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stuck at , the wrong period . It was not because they had never had anything else before their eyes : nothing could be more charming than Washington Place in Honolulu , or the old " missionary house " in Lahaina , on Maui . They did not , however , stick to the good aesthetics of the pioneers ; they progressed : they seem to have gone to Kansas for their later inspiration ? and never to have come away . When that is said , nothing remains to be charged against civilization in Honolulu . This in itself would be small cause for petulance in another place . But here the eye enters upon an inheritance so gorgeous beyond preconception that it shrinks unwontedly from all that is not beauty . The part of the town that is not occupied by Americans is oddly uninteresting . Here and there a district known as " Portuguee town " contributes a vivid pink house to the general audacity . But the Chinese and Japanese districts are far less picturesque than the Oriental quarter in San Francisco ? even since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , housing Hawaiians and the poorer Orientals , are very like any other slums ? save that here the sun will find out a way . It is a platitude that foreign slums ? Italian , for example ? are often picturesque . In Honolulu they scarcely are ; for the buildings are not old , and they make the most colorless corner of that parti-colored world . Prosperity , I suppose , makes for gayer kimonos , for paler stuffs in Chinese coats and trousers , for more leis and fresher flowers setting off the Hawaiian bronze . The folk who live in the Honolulu tenements are very poor ; " drab " is the formal epithet for poverty , and with drab even the sun can do little . The poorer quarters of Honolulu are not so depressing as some other slums ; for until one is quite used to the visual preponderance of yellow and brown men , there is delight in the mere strangeness of the crowds . And they are not so extensive , these poorer quarters : they are far outstripped by the comfort and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , who could refrain from noticing , and mentioning , such slums as there are ? Another feature prominent in the mere aspect of Honolulu is the army . We have seven or eight thousand troops there ; it is a regulation for Hawaii that officers and men alike must wear uniform ; and the ugly , efficient khaki is everywhere , as well as the tropical white . On the whole , the khaki uniform is less beautiful than the holoku ; and the military note is a note of pure ugliness . After a few weeks the negro regiments seem strange to the eye . It is impossible not to match up the negro type against the Polynesian and find it wanting . An aesthetically passionate person can quite understand the contempt with which the Kanaka looks down upon the black man . This , though the negro soldier is usually a fine creature , physically speaking , and at his best suggests the imposing Zulu . It is the modelling of the Polynesian countenance that gives the Kanaka the palm : the delicate aquiline contour , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a European 's , crowning the head . Geographically , too , the army counts immensely in Oahu . There are five forts in or about Honolulu town , not to mention Schofield Barracks on a neighboring plateau . Diamond Head is mined and galleried , so that on occasion it could be as dangerous as in its volcanically " active " days . The monstrous works going on at Pearl Harbor it would take an expert to appreciate ; at present they are in the least illuminating of all stages ? that of dredging . A visit to Pearl Harbor ? @#  |p530  a strange , octopus-shaped arm of the sea ? is about as unrewarding for the common person as a visit to a sugar-mill . Our New England consciences took us to both ; and , personally , I brought back from the adventures only the conviction that dredging is not pretty to look at and that sugar-cane is not good to chew . Those who like to chew sugar-cane may very fairly infer that I have done little justice to the dredging . I confess it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies wholly Waikiki of the town ? that being , literally , the topographical idiom . ( You are never told to go north or south , east or west : you go " mauka " ? towards the mountains , or go " makai " ? towards the sea ; a shop lies on King Street " Waikiki " or " Ewa " of Fort or Nuuanu . ) The city stretches some seven miles , end to end , along the sea-front , running back , up enchanted valleys , to the mountains : the Pali , or Tantalus . " Ewa " of Honolulu are Pearl Harbor and Ewa plantation ; " Waikiki " of it is ? Waikiki . Here are the seaside hotels and restaurants , the Outrigger Club , Kapiolani Park , the beach-houses of rich Honolulans , and Diamond Head . Here are the bathing , the surf-riding , the general tourist activity ? as well as the amusements of Honolulans themselves . Across from the Moana Hotel is Ainahau , among whose giant trees and flowers Stevenson often sat with the little Kaiulani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died during Liliuokalani 's reign , and her father , Mr. Cleghorn , has been dead these many years . Ainahau has been sold ; but one can still lose oneself in those winding , overhung paths , the great palms cutting off the sky above one 's head , and imagine the opera-bouffe days of the monarchy , half-wishing that strange chapter back . The portraits of Kaiulani show her as very lovely and inevitably beloved . She had , too , the supreme wit to die young . To a man of Stevenson 's predilections , a beautiful young princess , half Polynesian and half Scotch , must have seemed one of the choicest works of God ; and at Ainahau , if ever , he must have been happy . In all successful social life , variety must somehow be achieved . In their circum/ scribed space happy Honolulans manage it by having several houses . Precisely as here , you go to the mountains or the sea for recuperation and amusement ; only in Hawaii you do not have to go so far . Half an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there at Kohala you can spend your Sunday , bathing in the multi-colored ocean . If mosquitoes bother you at Kohala , you can motor to the top of Tantalus , where , at two thousand feet , you are safe from them . Or you may have your beach house on the windward side of the Island , between Kahana and Kahuku . For a severer change , you can have a ranch on Kauai or Maui . If it is absolutely necessary for you to shiver ? and one can conceive that ? you can visit the volcano on Hawaii , or take the comfortable Kilauea to Maui , and climb Haleakala . In the concrete rest-house on that ten-thousand-foot rim you will need all the fur coats the family can provide . It is easy enough to change your climate and see a different beauty . Meanwhile , there is bridge , and the tango , and polo at Moanalua , and everything else that American civilization provides for one 's distraction . Plays and operas are rare , of course , though now and then some company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , must be blessedly free from lectures . Good golf is provided at the Oahu Country Club , or at Haleiwa . If you are tired of domesticity , you can sit on the floor in a kimono at a Japanese tea-house , while little geisha girls bring you all the things that the yellow man most oddly likes to eat , and the sake that he most wisely likes to drink . You can not skate or ski ; but you can go riding or bathing or surf-boating or shark-fishing any time you feel like it ; and on Hawaii , they tell me , you can put on a bathing-suit at the end of the day and coast down the dizzy cane-flumes . Except in a Kona storm you are seldom housed . Here the " unswerving season " brings no mitigation of beauty . Some transplanted people long at times for snow ; the true Islander , I believe , not often . In any case , the Canadian Rockies are not so much farther from them than from us ? above all , the journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be uncomfortably cold , there is , I am told , no chillier , snow-@#  |p532  ier place than Japan in winter . And even Japan is only nine days away . There is scarcely space to tell of all the sights of Honolulu . In the aquarium you can see fish that seem to have been created by French dressmakers . They look more like audacious mannequins at the Longchamps races than citizens of the simple ocean ? save that nature is less careful of color-harmonies than Worth and Paquin are wont to be , and that no dressmaker would venture on a costume d la squid . The aquarium , I believe , had this summer been rifled for the Hawaiian exhibit at the Panama-Pacific ; but , even so , it is a smallish place , not comparable with the chambers of wonder and horror at Naples . Or you can go out by the Kamehameha Schools to the Bishop Museum ? exquisitely panelled in the beautiful Hawaiian koa wood , dusky-gold and wildly grained ; repository of feather-cloaks and Polynesian antiquities of every sort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paki , and his giant surf-boards are nailed up in the entrance-porch . Everywhere in Honolulu you find witnesses to a now perished state of society , when princesses of the blood and daughters of great chiefs married Anglo-Saxons . With the passing of the monarchy and the subsidence of the native aristocracy , there is less temptation to the American or Englishman to espouse a native , and I believe it is not much done at present except in the lower classes ? though a deal of the best white blood is said to have received at some time or other a Polynesian tributary . It is natural , with the change of government , and all that change entails , that the fashion should have passed . Much else has passed with it : the knowledge of Hawaiian , for example . Every one uses Hawaiian words , but the majority of American children do not learn the language . They are carefully not allowed to , lest a chance Hawaiian playmate should let in a flood of Polynesian information on their innocent minds . The Kanaka infant has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teach . It is again , in some ways , a pity , for the Kanaka himself has no interest in the preservation of his tongue and it is degenerating into pidgin-talk . A scholar like Mr.  |p533  Parker , for fifty years pastor of the Kawaiahao church in Honolulu ; now and then a native demagogue who has cultivated the language for his own purposes ? these may keep some interest in the mellifluous and moribund tongue ; but that is all . It has virtually ceased to be stuff of rhetoric . Any learning the Kanaka may acquire is won at school , in English . It is easy to see the result . Beyond a convenient practical knowledge ? for it is often , in remote places , convenient to speak Hawaiian ? almost no one cares to go . Besides , it would be more to the point , practically , to learn Japanese . There are other sights a-plenty in Honolulu . There are the schools , from Punahou Academy down ; there is the Lunalilo Home for aged Hawaiians , which I distinctly advise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not grow old well ? nature 's revenge for his beauty in youth and maturity ? and the Home was to us actually more depressing than the Leper Colony on Molokai . The shops are not particularly interesting : Hawaiian curios consist chiefly of ukuleles , bead and shell necklaces , and tapa cloth ? which , I regret to say , in this twilight of the Hawaiian day , is chiefly imported from Samoa . You can get calabashes and lauhala mats made to order , but the market is not drugged with them . The Hawaiian , as I have said , does not like to work . Even his poi ? except in country districts ? is made for him at a Japanese or Chinese poi-factory . There is nothing " native " that you want to take home with you , except the fruit , and even if you were naive enough to pack papayas and mangoes in your steamer-trunk , a California official would take them away from you before he let you through the Golden Gate . It seems that there are fruit-pests in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every sort ? including mosquitoes and leprosy ? have been brought thither from somewhere else . There are as yet no snakes , but sometime some one will smuggle in a rattler or two . The servant problem is made easy by the Orient . The Japanese cook will do everything in the world besides cooking : he will water your flowers and clean your car , raise your vegetables and press your clothes . If he is married , his wife will do that part of the work which he least likes , and between them you will be singularly comfortable . Your children will have Japanese nursemaids , your yard-boy will be Japanese as well . You will be wise to choose a Portuguese chauffeur ; but except for that one service the Japs will look after you . It is well , I am told , to give very positive orders , and to keep to your own regime , for the Jap 's imagination is peculiar to his race , and left to himself he will always do the most romantic thing . Hear now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Hawaiian experience I had been quite convinced that the Japanese were the Prussians of Asia . Every one knows how easy that impression is to get . I do not pretend to have arrived at it by profound study . It shocked me not a little , at first , to find Islanders taking the Yellow Peril so lightly ? not to say scoffingly . They seemed to me like those folk who have always nestled comfortably under Vesuvius . In another generation the voters of Hawaii will be overwhelmingly Japanese ; for Japanese children , Hawaiian born , are , of course , American citizens . It is interesting , too , to note that the Japanese do not , like Chinese , Portuguese , and whites , intermarry with other races . They are in the melting-pot , but they do not , in that sense , melt . Japanese children must go to the government schools and learn English ; but they must also go to Japanese schools , before and after school hours , on Saturdays and Sundays , and be instructed in their ancestral language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so hard , poor babies , and still look so gay and ephemeral , is a puzzle . Perhaps the secret of it is the kimono ? as , indeed , I suspect ( though it is a frivolous confession ) the kimono was at the root of my own conversion . A Jap father in a clean kimono , tending the baby , is the most disarming sight in the world . And they are always doing it , whether in front of their Honolulu shops or in their plantation villages . Undoubtedly they work , and work hard , but they are always playing with the babies , first , last , and in between . While we saw them daily in this attitude , I for/ got the " Japan Language Schools " ( often placed , for convenience , next the government-school building ) and the Shinto temples tucked away everywhere in the foliage . It is impossible to be afraid of any one who wears a kimono , and that fact may be either our salvation or our undoing in our relations with the Orient . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not so frivolous a matter , after all . The Japanese character is apparently a very different thing from that which many of us , at least , had conceived it to be . First of all , the Japanese is a romantic ? an out-and-out , absurd romantic . He is very sure of himself ; he will undertake to do anything you ask him to ; he is confident that he can imitate anything that he has seen , or perform any act that he has watched . He is his own publicity agent , too ? like the braggart child , and as little objectionable . ( I have even heard , authentically enough , that the famous Red Cross service in the Russo-Japanese War amounted only to a campaign of self-praise ; that actually the Japanese lost a greater proportion of men through disease than did the Russians . ) He is ambitious , always anxious to better himself . But The Jap will build your house for you ? probably in most cases he does ; but he is as likely as not to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he saves enough money on the plantation , he drifts into a Honolulu commission merchant 's , saying engagingly : " This time I make store . " He pays down his savings , gets additional credit , and proceeds to " make store . " But he is apt , in a year or two , to go bankrupt . He is so enamoured of his idea that he would rather sell everything in his shop on credit than to sell for cash and have any goods left on his shelves . Or he will be a chauffeur ; but the god of speed also is in his Pantheon , and he will break his or your neck with the most devoted abandon . It is terrifying to meet a carload of Japs in a narrow place . It is even more terrifying to be driven by a Jap yourself , round a mountain road with a Pali on your left and the sea five hundred feet below on your right . At the steepest point the Jap is sure to turn and tell you that this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed . If you are not im- pressed ( though , for many reasons , you probably are ) he will , very likely , add a dramatic account of how , not long ago , he was attacked at this very spot , by a band of Filipino marauders , all armed ; how , fortunately , he had no money ( you begin here to be grateful for your express cheque ) ; how , finally , by dint of coolness , courage , and speed , he got away . Even in his pidgin-English he makes literature of it ? until he becomes positively too excited by his own romance to proceed . It is like listening to the wild Odysseys of your own small boy . Luckily , the Jap likes to toot his horn : it is your only safeguard . Return over the same ground a few days later with a cautious Portuguese driver , and you will feel infinitely safer ? but you will find yourself missing something . The Japanese , in spite of their romance , are law-abiding folk ? another disarming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islands : he will loot , and kill for loot ? for an astonishingly small amount of loot . He kills very brutally , too . Occasionally , in the day 's work , the Japanese will slay ? but seldom ; and when he does , I have heard , it is apt to be a case of jealousy ? a crime passionel . It must , of course , be remembered that in Hawaii one deals largely with a Japanese type very different from that which we encounter here ; not the student or the merchant , but the laborer , the coolie . There are merchants , and there are educated Japanese of the better classes : priests , teachers , editors of papers , and so on . There is even the distinguished artist who will " do " your Japanese garden , or build your room for the tea ceremony , but who will not do either unless he has all the time he wants and absolute liberty to follow his tradition to the least detail of material and form . But these are few in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their hands , and the bulk of them are the common people . The women work on the plantations as well as the men , wearing a special dress : an odd series of dark garments , puttee-like leg-gear , huge flat hats tilted on their chignons at an angle of forty-five degrees , a white cloth hanging down beneath it to protect the neck from the sun . A kamaaina can tell at once the nationality and  |p535  the breed of an individual whom he passes ; but , though I am seldom at a loss to distinguish Chinese from Japanese in America , in Hawaii I found it as impossible as a task in a fairy-tale . The Japanese coolie is very like the Chinese coolie ; and in country districts there are the Koreans to confuse one . The women are easier to distinguish than the men , on account of their dress ? the Chinese trousers , the vast Filipino sleeves , are as unmistakable as the kimono . But the men in the canefields dress as is most convenient and , until they have gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . There are , besides , infinite complications of racemixture ; and , while we thought it easy to recognize a pure Hawaiian , the malihini could never be sure of the partHawaiian ? whether he was part Portuguese , part white , or part Chinese . It was like a child 's game to drive along a country road and ask : " This one ? This one ? This one ? " The kamaainas could always label them . At the end of the day it was easier for the malihini to guess ; for the Jap in his kimono is different from every one else in the world . On the whole , it is easy to see why the Islanders discount the Japanese peril . We heard one or two men of sense and long experience dissent from the common opinion , but not more than that . Only one or two were willing to admit that there might , in the next generation , be trouble . Most Americans in Hawaii have faith in the melting-pot ; they think the Jap soluble . This , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would still exceedingly like to possess them . When we quoted to them fears that we had heard expressed at home , they usually said , in sum : You wo n't find any one here outside of the army who believes that alarmist stuff ; of course , the army is always looking for trouble .  |p536  Certainly , the daily revelation of the Japanese temperament is allaying to fears . Whether Americans in Hawaii are misreading that temperament or not is in the womb of fate . But the Islander at least has a better chance to estimate the Japanese situation ? psychological , economic , political ? than we on the mainland . It may be that the Mikado sends out thousands of Japanese laborers with strict instructions to provide a spectacle of romantic inefficiency for the deluded American . It may be that wearing white kimonos and petting the babies are both done by imperial order . Perhaps the tale of overcrowded Japan is as false as the tale of overcrowded Germany ; perhaps , really , the Japanese , like the Germans , have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blind . If they are the Prussians of Asia , that is plausible . But in that case the Prussians of Asia do their deceiving much better than the Prussians of Europe . The Chinaman in Hawaii is very like himself anywhere . Every village , even the smallest , has its pake ( Chinese ) store . Often the pake store-keeper has a Hawaiian wife . The Chinaman has , as we all know , a great gift for business ; he is prudent , industrious , and honest . No one has ever paid him the doubtful compliment of fancying that there was a " Chinese problem . " The Chinese virtues are too well known for mention here ; though it may be remarked in passing that the Chinese-Hawaiian blend is said to be the best for character ( as it is , by and large , for physique ) of all those to which the Hawaiians treat themselves . The Chinaman ploughing his rice-fields with the classic water-buffalo , sitting decorously in his tidy shop , or selling unspeakable foods in his markets , lends a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience back of the Chinese face , male or female ; it is uralt ; it has psychology in it ; you feel that it would respond to a human problem . The flitting Japanese seem ephemeral creatures in comparison : artistic by blessed instinct , but not pre-eminently intellectual . Even when a Chinaman gets drunk , he does it with a difference . But that is for another and more exotic chapter . . . . In Honolulu we often ended up the evening by motoring to the Pali . Why , I do not know ; for in the darkness that view , which seems to gather into its lavish bounds half the history and half the beauty of Hawaii , does not exist . You peer over the great parapet , down the seven-hundred-foot drop , and see nothing but the glow-worm lights of Kaneohe , far beneath you and beyond , near the illimitable sea . You can not hear the surf ; you can not see the fern-stippled rock , or the pineapple plantations that tint windward Oahu with an ineffable green . Only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain and nearly oversets you . It is like a heavy scarf across your eyelids ; your lips can scarce move against it ; and you cling to any friend that is near . A hundred yards away there was not a breath , will not be when you return . But here , if you want to climb a few feet to the Kamehameha tablet set in the side of the cliff , you will be glad of the little railing to clutch . Except for that , you might be lifted and blown across the parapet , down the cliff over which Kamehameha the Great once drove an army . The view from the Pali is ever various ? morning and afternoon , mist and sun , tell different tales of it . But it is always significant : all the violent volcanic beauty of Hawaii , together with its tropic softness , is measured there lavishly for you . Kamehameha has stamped his legend on the cliff where your feet are set ; the multi-colored ocean , beyond the coral-gardens of Kaneohe , spreads out its lonely leagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , past , and through you , is overdue for the Equator and the sinister low archipelagoes of the South . Some sense of this was always heavy upon us as we breasted that expanse . Even at night the lights of Kaneohe seemed to hint it all . Every tourist , in his few hours ' stop-over , can drive to the Pali ; and of that one is glad . For the Pali is more essential than Waikiki or Diamond Head or Pearl Harbor . Its memories are preTerritorial , and its inclusive beauty is as poignant and inimitable as the Hawaiian voice lifted in Polynesian song . Returning , you wind through dim jungles of hau-trees that no army , it seems , could cut or blast away , until you reach the Country Club and Nuuanu Avenue , and then Honolulu town and harbor .  |p537  The wind , free of the rock wall and appeased , follows you down to the ships . Six miles from the cleft in the Pali the lei women sit on Hotel Street ( as per postcard ) and sell their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner or later , alas ! you must be ? your friends stock themselves heavily . You are bowed down with weight of flowers as you steam away from Honolulu . Very likely your heart is heavy , too . Sooner than you would wish the long , parti-colored streamers that you have flung to your friends on the dock break and fall away into the ocean . The fragile rainbow bond is severed ; the last boy dives , Kanaka-fashion , standing erect , from the top of a life-boat ; and you take up the trail again . But , whichever way one sails , the keenest visual memory is of the Pacific seen from a volcanic height : the view from the Pali windward , half a world away to the frozen North ; for us , ever the view southward across the town , the harbor , the reef , and the blazing ocean , from the happy heights of Alewa. @#
