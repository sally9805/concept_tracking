txt The Inside story , or as near the inside story as an outsider can get , of the real estate deal by which the State of New York was obliged to pay $100 an acre for - the 618-acre tract on which the new Harlem Prison will be reared to supplant Ellie Sing , thereby netting a profit of about . 423.000 to Robert Hurd of Pawling , N. Y .. ' and Charles Ralph Diehl , son-in-law of Assemblyman John R. Yale of Brenrstet% Putnam County , was learned to-day . It was denied emphatically , however , by both Assemblyman Yale and Mr. Hurd . that a political " tip " was responsible for the foresight displayed by Mr. Hurd : and Mr. Diehl in anticipating the State . authorities in the choice of a prison site .. Said Mr. Hurd : " I never received any tip . I knew the State was looking for a site , and I thought that the Wingdale property would make an excellent location . As a I matter of fact , if it had been known that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a purpose . I could not have got these options for ' double the sum that I paid . " I never had any tip from anybody and was not In communication with any of the State officials connected with the purchase of a prison site at any time . I simply knew that the State wanted to buy . and took a chance on selling the Wingdale farms . As for the statement that - most of the property was swamp land , there are jusr 5 acres out of the ; 618 which are swamp . " Mr. Hurd and Mr. Diehl are friends of long standing . Mr Diehl , in addition to the distinction of having an Assembly ' man for a father-in-law , is a Trustee of the village of Brewster . His father is Village President , and they are partnere in a confectionery business under the ! name of Philip Diehl Son , in Main ' Street , the principal thoroughfare . Hurd 's the Master Mind . Mr. Hurd is something of a politician . He is a Democrat , has been Road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a delegate to the Democratic State Conventions . He Is a dealer in cattle at times and is always ready to turn a profit in a speculative way . In the matter of the new prison site Mr. Hurd is geld to - have been the master mind . ' After the old Bear Mountain site had been abandoned by Gov . Hughes and the Legislature , and the Commission on . New Prisons was casting about for another location , Mr. Hurd hastened about the countryside and obtalebd options on some of the farming lands near Wing- , dale . He thought it would be a likely , site for a ' prison . One of the farms he ; obtained an option on was the old Wheel- ' er place , a tract of MEI acres , the show place of Wingdele , and one of the best properties in this section . Other places on which M. Hurd obtained options were the Titus farm of 158 acres , the Brown farm of twenty-one acres , and the Wilcox property , with an acreage of sevepty-two and a fraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the property of the State . But Mr. Hurd did n't , buy the farms . He only obtained options on them . It costs money , however , even to hold an option , so Mr. Hurd sought out his friend . Mr. Diehl , and they became partners in the transaction . Although the fact has been a secret until to-day , Mr , Hurd and his temporary partner did not intend to take up their options on the farms unless the Committee on New Prisons decided to take them at the figure offered . The figure , of course , was high enough to make it worth the while of Mr. Hurd and Mr. Diehl . As for Assemblyman Yale , he says that he played no part In the transaction , and his son-inlaw corroborates him . Assemblyman Yale , who is a Republican , was a member and still is of the Ways and Means Committee and of the Committee oh Water , Gas , and Electricity . But it was the Governor 's Commission on New Prisons that had the say as to whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites for the new prison . Paid 34,91:10 for the Land . With their options quite safe Mr. Hurd and Mr. Diehl entered into an agreement with the commissions on June 11 , 1010 , by which the sale of the four farms to the State was pledged . And then the options on the properties were taken up by Hurd and Diehl . The prices they paid for the four farms were also a secret until to-day . But a TIMES reporter , learned from a reliable source that Hurd and Diehl paid S25 , i99e.for the Wheeler estate , $5,000 for the Titus farm , $1,01 ) 0 for the Brown farm , and . F:3.000 for the ' Wilcom farm , a total of $34.9 ( O. Perhaps it would not have been necessary for the State to , have bought the three last-named farms had it not been for the water rights . Water is a necessary article for prisons . There is a stream winding through the Wheeler estate . But its source is high up on one of the hills to the westward , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Commission on New Prisons decided four farms instead of one were needed . And four were bought . There is nothing in the deeds to the properties to show the real prices paid either by Hurd and Diehl or by the State . The transfer of the property bears the date of Nov. 11 , 1910 , and it was recorded on Nov. 14 in the Dutchess County Clerk 's office . It is on the eastern edge of the Wheeler estate that the new prison will be . Already the land has been plotted off by the State Engineers , and the contractors , P. J. Carlin Co , of New York City , will start next week to erect the buildings called for in the appropriation of $ : , 96 , - 000 . Only a few feet away are the Harlem Railroad tracks . Part of the tract is marsh and swamp , but only a small part . and out of the 618 acres there are probably 150 , or even 200 acres , which may be used for agricultural purposes , land which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put to work tilling for the prison commissary department . Prison Site Low Lund . The land which the new prison will occupy Is very low . It would be part of the swamp were it not for the railroad embankment which separates It from Swamp River , which skirts the Wheeler property on the east . The land has been in cultivation for many years . Oats and hay have been grown there as long as the oldest inhabitant can remember . Just across the railroad is the swamp . The residents of Wingdale , however , say they are never bothered much by mosquitos. in Summer , and that there is no healthier spot in the State . They say that centenarians are not at all rare around there . Wingdale folk do not complain of the proximity of the prison . In fact , some of them are very glad , for they say it will boom the village . The only ones who seem sad about the matter are the former owners of the four farms WW1 yipira snapped up by Mr. Diehl and Mr. Hurd before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted the lands . Assemblyman Yale was at home In Brewster when a TIMES reporter called today . He was told that William Church Osborn and George Van Heiman had been directed by Gov . Dix to investigate the manner in which the prison site was obtained . " Well . the only connection I have in the whole matter is that Mr. Diehl is my son-in-law , " said the Assemblyman . " I derived no profit from the transaction . But I am glad to say that my son-in-law did make a reasonable profit . He and Mr. Hurd showed themselves to be wise business men . It was just a good business proposition , and the State got a bargain . There is no getting around that . Yale Defends the Deal . " Why . we would n't have cared if the State had n't bought the farms . I say we only because my son-in-law was one of the parties to the transaction , not because I had any interest in it . A hundred an acre for the Wheeler farm ! Why , the Wheelers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finest hay-growing properties ip this part of the State . And remember tnls  --  the State gathered the crop last Pall . It cut 100 acres of hay . Moreover , the State did n't pay a cent of interest from the time it got the properies until January of this year , when the purchase price was paid . " " How did your son-in-law learn that it would be a wise move to get options on the properties " : " " He was told so by Mr. Hurd , I suppose . You see , Mr. Hurd has a long business head , and he got the options in the first place . Two years ago . you ' will remember , the Bear Mountain site was abandoned and the Commission on New Prisons began looking around for a new site . Some fifteen or sixteen were considered . One was at Cold Spring . Another was on Long Island . but Senator Hobbs of Suffolk opposed that so strongly that it newer received serious consideration Merely Good Business Men . " Mr. Hurd knew that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , that the objection raised by most communities against having a prison in their midst Would not be raised at Wingdale . So he obtained his options . Mr. Hurd sought out my son-in-law , who is well off . They entered into the transaction , and both Proved themsehles good business men . " As for the price paid by the State , I wish to say that in all my ten years ' experience in the Legislature I have never seen the State get a better bargain . Why , the site for the Randall 's Island Institution purchased by the State at Mohansic , just east of Peekskill , cost the State $250 an acre , and the tract was between 300 and 400 acres , I believe . Yet the State has only paid $100 an acre for the prison site . The State could sell it to-day for what It paid . " It is an ideal location , five miles away from the Gammage School . and with no one near who objects to its proximity . The railroad station is only a five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . What more could the State wish ? As for the investigation , I guess Mr. Osborn wants to stir up things . He comes from this county , you know . "
