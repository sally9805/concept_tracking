txt Morris Eisner , head of the syndicate that has contracted to pay $1,000,000 to Dr. Friedrich Franz Friedmann for his turtle vaccine for tuberculosis , exhibited yesterday what he said were photographic copies of a statement/purporting ' to bear the sign iture of Dr. Maurice A. Sturm , formerly of the Friedmann forces , but who is now opposed to the German physician . In the alleged statement Dr. Sturm is made to admit that he has " no knowledge of the method of preparing said vaccine or of the ingredients composing the same . " When a copy of this statement was shown to Dr. Sturm in his office in the Hotel Ansonia last night he said : e ? The signature of my name is a forgery . I neither wrote the statement described by Mr. Eisner as being in my handwriting nor authorized its preparation nor signed it . " Dr. Sturm 's lawyer , Jacob I. Wiener of 261 Broadway , was present at the examination of the exhibit , and after a consultation with his client said : " I am goring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thereafter will pursue such course vs is warranted in the premises . I hava been Dr. Sturm 's counsel for twelve years and have seen his signature repeatedly . This is the boldest piece of forgery I ever saw , and I shall bring the culprits to justice . " Some one suggested in fun that an opinion on the writing should be sought from Dr. Friedmann , who prides himself on his cleverness with the pen . He has demonstrated his skill innocently by copying the signatures of Emperor William and others . The photographed statement was brought forword yesterday afternoon at a meeting of the Friedmann forces in the physician 's apartments at the Hotel Majestic . There were present Dr. Friedmann , his lawyer , A. G. Hays , of 60 Wan Street ; Mr. Eisner , Dr. Julian G. Meyer , who will be one of the physicians in attendance at the New York headquarters of the " cure " that are being prepared in the twelve-room house at West End Avenue and 103d Street ; Capt . David Arnold of . tha Rhode Island diail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Friedmann , and the newspaper reporters . " Here are photographs of the Sturm statement , " Mr. Eisner announced , passing around copies . ' " Where is the original ? " Mr. Elsner was asked . . ? " It IS locked up in the safe , " he replied . " Under what circumstances was the statement ' prepared ? " " I tan say nothing - about that , " Mr. Eisner answered . " Dr. Sturm wrote the statement and signed it . That is all I will say . ' " The statement is dated April 27 , 1913 , the day on which the contract between Mr. Eisner and Dr. Friedmann was signed , and reads : Having to-day made the statement that I have knowledge of the formula for the preparation of Dr. Friedrich Franz Friedmann 's vaccine , I now , of my own free will repudiate that *statement as in all respects unwarranted , and I fully and voluntarily say that I have no knowledge of the method of preparing said vaccine or of the ingredients composing the same . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be expresesd anger and amazement . " But wait , " he shouted dramatically . " I now recall that on May 1 I received a telephone message from Dr. A. C. H. Friedmann , brother of the discoverer , asking me to come to his office at 43 Exchange Place and consult with him on an important matter . I complied , and he said to me : ' I saw Eisner last night , and he said they were going to produce a statement saying you know nothing about the remedy . The state meat was witnessed and signed before a notary public . I saw it . I want to put you on your guard . ' He asked me if I had signed any paper of such a nature within two or three days . I told him I had not . " Lawyer Wiener asked Dr. Sturm to write his name a dozen times rapidly , and also to get from his files papers and checks bearing his signature . These signatures were compared with that on the photographs . In all except the photographed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. " to his name . Mr. Wiener called attention to what he said were fundamental discrepancies between the photographed signature and Dr. Sturm 's writing . air . Wiener said that within a day or two he would apply for summonses for one or more persons to appear in a Magistrate 's court in forgery proceedings . After the display of the photographs of Dr. Sturm 's alleged statement Dr. Friedmann and Mr. Eisner locked horns in a heated discussion over the provisions for the sale of the turtle vaccine to charity patients . Mr. Eisner had said that four or five physicians , without a governing head , would begin work next week in offices fitted up for their use in the West End Avenue house . These physicians would work independently , he said , in order to conform to the law , which prohibits the practice of medicine by a corporate institution . " If these physicians devote their time to pay patients , how will the poor receive - treatment ? " Mr. Eisner was , asked . " We will insist that the poor bb treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that neither he nor any other person would act as head of the institution . He said he could not give orders to the attending physicians . " But I insist that the poor shall be treated . " Dr. Friedmann shouted , " in accordance with the contract I made with you . " " The contract does not specify how this can be done , " Mr. Eisner averred . " . Yes it does . It says you must treat charity patients , " Dr. Friedmann in ' silted . He ran out of the - room and returned with his copy of the contract . waving it and announcing he would show it-to the newspaper reporters . " Donit do that . You do n't know what , you are doing . You do n't know what you are saying when you speak in English . " Mr. Eisner protested . Dr. Friedmann folded the paper so only a sentence was revealed , and read it aloud . It was a general statement to the effect that the poor would receive treanment free of charge . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else could enforce the clause if the physicians of the institution declined to perform free service except that he could refuse to sell the turtle vaccine to recalcitrants . He suggested that one day a week would be set apart for charity patients if the physicians agreed . It became known yesterday that Mr. Eisner personally  --  and not as committing the firm of the Elsner-Mendelsohn Company , 90 Wall Street  --  entered Into the contract with Dr. Friedmann , who has thus far received only $50,000 of the contract price . It is provided that he shall receive the next payment of $75 - 000 after he has instructed the physicians in the West End Avenue house in the use of the vaccine .
