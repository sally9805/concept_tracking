txt Most of the diplomatic and consular service of the United States is beyond the scope of the civil service law and rules because the appointments ' are made by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate , and it has been held that Congress can not tie the hands of the President , or in any substantial degree limit his discretion . But as long ago as June 27 , 1906 , President ROOSEVELT fixed certain rules for his own guidance in selections for the consular service , and in the Fall of 1909 President TAFT fixed similar rules for , his guidance in selections for the diplomatic service in its subordinate branches . The purpose of these rules established by successive Presidents was to provide adequate tests for applicants fdr appointment , such as would determine the real prima facie fitness for appointment or for promotion and enable the President , with the aid of the Secretary of State , to pick out the men likely to be of the greatest utility to the department , and especially to give to the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promotion , when deserved , that would attract the best young men to it as to a profession . A good deal was accomplished ; the testimony is unanimous that the foreign service never was on a higher plane or better organized or more efficient , and this improvement has been the effect of the application of the principles of the merit system through the discretion of the Chief Executive . A bill is now pending in Congress , introduced by the Hon. FRANK 0 . LOWDEN , with the approval of the Secretary of State , the object of which is to do what can be done to make this system permanent . Of course the discretion of the President has to be respected , but the duties of the various officers concerned in carrying out the plan of President ROOSEVELT and President TAFT are defined ; it is made the regular duty of the Secretary of State to report the names of persons examined under the circular of the two Presidents , with their standing ; the various grades of Secretaries of Embassy anti ' ' of Legation are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Examiners is provided for , the scope and character of the examinations are defined , it is determined that the examinations must be held at least once annually , that they " shall be conducted with strict impartiality and without regard to the political or other affiliations of any candidate , " and that the report of the examiners to the Secretary of State shall be made public . Should this bill become a law , and it is quite feasible to pass it at the short session , since there ought to be no serious opposition to it , it would go as far as Congress can go under , the present interpretation of the Constitution to give the permanence of legal sanction to the admirable system voluntarily framed by President ROOSEVELT and President TAFT for the proper regulation of the foreign service . It is extremely important that this should be done . Of course there is no doubt that Mr. TAFT , as long as he holds the office of President , will enforce the merit system and improve it to the - best of bis ability , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his would wish to undo what has been done . It is one of the most striking features of the history of the merit system in the United States that since its beginning , more than a quarter of a century ago , there has been no step backward taken in regard to it by Congress , and hardly any by any President . But it Is well to fix the system within the protection of the law , so far as possible , in order that the successive Presidents , and ? Secretaries of State shall have its saneI/tion to strengthen and sustain them . It is reported that kr . EVARTS , stepping into the:elevator to gp to Ihis.office : early in his term as Secretary , fotind , It . crowded . " This , L ' he remarked , is one of the heaviest collections for foreign missions I have , ever seen taken up . " The pressure of such " collections " is very great , and it is invariably mischievous . As the power and influence of the United States extend it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manned by competent officers , trained in their .... calling , advanced from grade to grade according to their proved . capacity . This was the aim of Presidents ROOSEVELT and TAFT in the rules they imposed on themselves , and it will be promoted by the law proposed .
