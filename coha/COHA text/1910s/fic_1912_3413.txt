Illustration : Heigho ! Little girls and boys who are good ! Come , read these tales with me ! For the secrets they tell You will understand well If you 're good as good can be ! THE WISE GRASSHOPPER " Come , Billy ! " Billy dropped his tin-soldier on the ground and ran in to help his mother wipe the dishes . She gave him a nice , fresh towel and he began to rub the tin plates as fast as he could . He never put one down until he could see himself in it . As for the tin cups , his mother sometimes thought he would rub them entirely away ! But he never did quite that . You see , Billy 's mother allowed him to dry only the tin dishes because he was so very little , she thought he might break the china ones . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front gate to buy the dinner from the vegetable-man . While she was gone , he finished all the tin dishes on the draining-tray . There was still a beautiful , white , china cup to be dried . " I believe I 'll wipe just that one ! " said Billy . He reached up , caught hold of the cup and was carefully bringing it down to his other hand , when --  " Crash ! "  - -  the cup lay on the floor in pieces . Billy was very frightened . He looked out of the door to see if his mother was coming . But she was still talking to the vegetable-man . Then he did a strange thing . He pushed all the pieces of the broken cup under the table and ran out the back door to his toys . But he did not play with them . He sat down on a stone , chin in hand . The little tin-soldier looked up at him as if to say , " Come on , Billy , let 's march ! " The little horse-and-wagon stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Billy , let 's go travelling ! " The little Teddy Bear , with his head on one side , seemed to say , " Come on Billy , let 's have a romp ! " Illustration : " Crash ! " the cup lay on the floor , in pieces . But Billy did not stir . He just sat there thinking . Suddenly , something said right out loud , " Why what 's the matter , Billy ? " Billy jumped . Looking around , he saw a grasshopper sitting on a blade of grass . Illustration : " Why , what 's the matter , Billy ? " " What is the matter this morning , Billy ? " the grasshopper asked . " I 'm afwaid -- I 'm afwaid I 'm a bad boy , " answered Billy . " Why , how is that ? " exclaimed the grasshopper . " Well -- I was going to wipe one of my mother 's china cups this morning and it hit the floor and bwoke ! " confessed Billy . " What did you do then ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Billy turned very red . He hated to tell the grasshopper what he had next done . " If you tell me , perhaps I can help you , " said the grasshopper , by way of encouragement . " Well , " said Billy , " I hid the pieces under the table and came out here -- to think ! " " Why do you not go and tell your mother all about it ? " asked the grasshopper . " O , " gasped Billy , " I could not do that ! I 'm afwaid ! " " Why should you be afraid , " continued the grasshopper . " Does n't your mother love you ? " " O yes , " cried Billy , " a million bushels ! " " And do n't you love your mother ? " said the grasshopper . " O yes , a hundwed million bushels ! " answered Billy . " Then go and tell her you broke the cup ! You will be happy if you do ! " " I ca n't , " said Billy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ! " cried the grasshopper , jumping over to another blade of grass . " I would n't be afraid ! What kind of a man do you think you 'll grow up to be ? " " Well , " said Billy , " perhaps I will tell her . You wait here till I come back ! " Very slowly he walked to the door . His heart beat so hard he could hear it thumping . As he stood in the door-way , a shame-faced little Billy , his mother looked up and said , " Did you come to help mother shell the peas ? " For that is what she was doing . But Billy did not answer . He walked up close to her . " Mother , " he said , " I -- I bwoke a cup ! " " Yes , darling , " she said , putting her arm around him , " Mother knows it . She found the pieces . And she 's been wondering if her little boy would n't come in and tell her all about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful smile that he loved . " I thought you would be sorry ! " he said . " I am sorry , Billy , that you broke the cup but I am glad -- so glad -- that you were brave enough to tell Mother the truth about it . Mother wants you to grow up to be a brave man . " She raised his face and kissed both his flushed little cheeks . " I 'll be back in a minute , Mother , " he said , as he drew away and ran out of the door . There was the grasshopper , hopping around . When he saw Billy , he stopped . " Did n't I tell you ! " he said , for he saw Billy 's smiling face and knew he was happy again . " How did you know ? " asked Billy . The grasshopper put his head on one side and said , " Oh , I am a grasshopper , very , very wise ! I know about everything underneath the skies ! " At that he hopped such a big hop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called out , " Good-bye , Grasshopper ! " Then he looked at his sad little toys , lying on the ground , and said , " I 'll be back after while to play with you ! I am going in to help my mother shell the peas ! " And away he ran as fast as his little legs would carry him . A HAPPY DAY Billy was off for a walk . He had kissed his mother good-bye ; he had stood his toys up in the corner ; and now , with his little lunch-basket in his hand , he was running down to the gate when somebody said , " Good-morning , Billy ! Where are you going ? " Illustration : The grasshopper hopped such big hops . He looked around and there sat a grasshopper on a blade of grass . " Good-morning , Grasshopper , " said Billy . " I 'm going for a walk . " " I should like to go with you , " said the grasshopper . " May I ? " " Of course ! " answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were off like the wind , but the grasshopper hopped such big hops , he had to wait for Billy to catch up after each hop . " Stop running ! " he called out as he sat waiting . " You might tread on this ant . " When Billy came up , he saw an ant trying to pull a piece of bread to the door of her house . How hard the ant was working ! Up hill and down hill , for ridges of earth in the road seemed like great hills to the little ant . " Why do n't you help the ant , Billy ? " asked the grasshopper . " That 's so ! " said Billy . " I will ! " He brought a green leaf and said , " Now Mrs. Ant , if you will pull the bread on this leaf , I will help you to get it to your home . " " O , thank you ! " said the ant . " My babies are very hungry . " So she put the bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew the leaf to the little hill of sand that he knew was the ant 's house . " Thank you ! " said the ant . " You are very kind , little boy ! " " You are welcome , " said Billy and he and the grasshopper went on their way . Suddenly they stopped . There , on the edge of the road , was a tiny baby-bird . It was trying to fly , but it was too little . Its wings were not strong enough . " I believe I 'll take it home , " said Billy . " O Billy , " exclaimed the grasshopper , " Do n't you hear its mother calling to it ? There she is on that branch , flapping her wings and calling . She wants it in the nest again but she does not know how to get it there . Why do n't you put it in the nest for her ? " " That 's so ! " said Billy . " I will ! " So they hunted in the bushes and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were two other little baby-birds in it and when Billy put in the little bird that had fallen , they all began to chirp , " Peep ! Peep ! Peep ! " That meant " Thank you ! " Then the mother-bird hopped around so gladly and said " Thank you , little boy ; you are very kind ! " " You are welcome , " replied Billy and he and the grasshopper went on their way . Pretty soon they grew hungry . They sat down and opened the lunch-basket and while they were eating the bread and jelly and nuts that Billy 's mother had put up for him , a little squirrel hopped out of his hole in a tree . He cocked his head on one side and watched them with bright little eyes . " Why do n't you give him a nut ? " asked the grasshopper . " That 's so ! " said Billy . " I will ! " So he threw a nut on the grass . The squirrel picked up the nut , cracked it with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Billy threw him another and another . When everything was gone , the squirrel said , " Thank you , little boy . You are very kind ! " " You are welcome , " said Billy , and for some reason he felt very happy . As he and the grasshopper were walking along again , they saw a beautiful , big butterfly sitting on a tall , yellow poppy . It was quite still . So Billy said , " That butterfly is asleep ! I 'm going to put it in my hat and take it home ! " " He is not asleep ! " contradicted the grasshopper . " He has just waked up ! He is waiting for his wings to grow strong , so he can fly . Leave him here in the sunshine . He would be very unhappy if you took him into your house ! " The grasshopper hopped way out of sight , for this was the very longest speech he had ever made . " O , please come back , grasshopper ! " called Billy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower ? " The grasshopper was beside Billy before he had finished speaking . " No , no ! " he replied to Billy 's question . " He slept in the little house that he made for himself before he went to sleep ! " The grasshopper looked at an empty cocoon hanging from a twig of a tree . " Is that his house ? " asked Billy , looking at it very curiously , for he had never seen anything like it before . The grasshopper nodded his head and winked an eye . Just then the butterfly began to move his beautiful yellow and black wings up and down , very , very slowly . " Why do n't you fly ? " asked Billy , " I 'm not going to take you home with me . " " Thank you for leaving me out in the sunshine , " said the butterfly , " I want to fly up to the blue sky very much indeed and , if I wait and work my wings , they will grow stronger and then I shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why do n't you fly ? " Billy sat down on a stone and the grasshopper perched on a blade of grass . " Did you know how to fly before you went to sleep ? " asked Billy . " O dear no ! " replied the butterfly . " I was only a caterpillar and had to creep along the earth or on cabbage leaves . " " Only a caterpillar ! " gasped Billy . " Then where did you get those wings ? " " They grew in the night , " answered the butterfly , " while I was asleep . " At this the grasshopper began to laugh . He laughed so hard , he had to hold his sides . " Why are you laughing , Grasshopper ? " asked Billy indignantly . The grasshopper did not answer him , but said , " Butterfly , do you know how long you slept in that little house you made for yourself when you were a caterpillar ? " " How long ? " asked the butterfly , who had been working his wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many nights , all through the cold winter . The wind rocked you in your little cradle-house ; the rain kept your house nice and soft ; and now , today , the warm , spring sun has waked you up and soon you will fly ! " At these words , the butterfly pressed his wings down and soared up in the air , over the trees and far away . " Good-bye , " he called out as he disappeared among the tall trees , " and thank you , little boy ! " " You are welcome , " called Billy and then he sat still and silent . " What 's the matter , Billy ? " asked the grasshopper . " I was wishing that I might fly ! " said Billy . " Who knows ! " exclaimed the grasshopper . " Perhaps you may some day ! " " But I can run ! " and Billy was off down the road on his way home . The grasshopper overtook him in one hop . " Shall we stop and pick some flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's so ! " said Billy , " we will ! " So they went into a field and began to pick flowers . Billy picked a daisy and the grasshopper picked a daisy . Billy picked a clover and the grasshopper picked a clover . Billy picked a bluet and the grasshopper picked a bluet . Billy picked a wind flower and the grasshopper picked a wind flower . Then the grasshopper gave his flowers to Billy and Billy thanked him . " Now , we must go home , " said Billy , so they ran until they came to Billy 's door . " I am glad you went with me , Grasshopper , " said Billy . " Shall we go again some day ? " " We will go again , some day ! " replied the grasshopper , bowing very low . " Good-bye , " said Billy , as he ran in to give his mother the flowers and tell her all about his walk . As she smiled and listened to Billy , the grasshopper peeped in at the open window and sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very , very wise ! I know about everything underneath the skies ! " THE LITTLE PIECE OF PINK WORSTED Billy sat on his stone in the back yard , his chin in his hand . He had just gotten home from kindergarten and his mother had told him to go out in the yard and play with his toys until dinner was ready . But he was not playing with his toys . He had laid his tin-soldier on the grass , though the little tin-soldier had been sleeping all morning and felt like a march . He had stood his horse-and-wagon in the shade , though the horse had been resting all morning and felt like a gallop . He had braced his Teddy Bear against a tree , though the Teddy Bear had been leaning against a chair all morning and felt like a romp . They all looked reproachfully at Billy , but he did not notice them . He seemed to be thinking deeply . Suddenly he put his hand in his pocket . When he drew it out , it was a little fist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a piece of pink worsted , all crumpled up ! He took an end of it in each hand and stretched it out as long as he could reach . Then he crumpled it up again and put it in his pocket . Illustration : " What 's that in your pocket ? " " What 's that , Billy ? " Billy jumped . Looking in the direction of the voice , he saw a grasshopper sitting on a blade of grass . " What 's that in your pocket ? " asked the grasshopper . " Just a little piece of worsted , " Billy replied , putting his hand in his pocket again to be sure it was there . " Where did you get it ? " asked the grasshopper . " At kindergarten , " answered Billy . " Teacher give it to you ? " Billy did not answer . " Did she ? " persisted the grasshopper . " N -- no , " said Billy reluctantly while his face turned very red . " Well , who did ? " continued the grasshopper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " replied Billy . " Found it on the kindergarten floor , " exclaimed the grasshopper , " and brought it home with you ? " " Well , " Billy defended himself , " ' findin 's keepin 's ! ' " " O Billy , " cried the grasshopper , " if you lost your little tin-soldier , and another little boy found it , would n't you want him to bring it back to you ? " " Course ! " The grasshopper put his head on one side and looked at Billy . Billy looked at the ground . Finally he spoke . " My teacher has so much worsted ! I do n't know how many cards you could sew with all she has -- all colors too ! " The grasshopper put his head on the other side and looked at Billy . Billy began to feel very uncomfortable . " Why do n't you take it back and tell your teacher all about it ? " asked the grasshopper . " Take it back ! " gasped Billy , " and give it to my teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put it on the the floor . " " Mercy on us ! " exclaimed the grasshopper , jumping over to another blade of grass , " Be a man ! You will be happier after you have told her . " Now Billy knew that his teacher always stayed at kindergarten , after the children had gone , to " straighten up " and his kindergarten was right across the street . So he thought a moment and then jumped up . " You wait here till I come back ! " And away he ran as fast as his little legs would carry him . But when he reached the kindergarten door , he stopped . His teacher was sitting with her back to the door , arranging the worsted in the large , linen worsted-case . She was humming a little song , too . Billy 's heart beat fast , for he loved his teacher and thought her the most beautiful lady in all the world next to his mother . He started to run away , but he remembered the grasshopper 's words , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand in his pocket and tip-toed into the room , right up to his teacher . " O , " she said , " I thought you were a little mouse , Billy ! " She laughed as she said it but Billy looked very grave . He pulled his little fist out of his pocket , held it toward her and opened it . " I bwought this back to you ! I found it on the floor . " " And took it home ? " asked his teacher , her beautiful eyes wide open . " Yes , " answered Billy , " I did n't think you would want it . " " And when you got home , you thought I would want it ? " she asked . Billy nodded . The tears had come to his eyes , though he had tried to keep them back . " Thank you , Billy , " she said in a low voice as she smoothed out the crumpled worsted and put it in the case . It was a little soiled but she did not seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drew him close to her . " I am glad you brought the worsted back , Billy , " she said , " for it shows me that you are a brave little man ! It makes me love you very much . " Billy looked up at her with shining eyes . " I love you too ! " he declared . She kissed his forehead . " Now run home to your dinner ! " she said . Billy ran as fast as he could until he saw the grasshopper . Then he stopped . " You look very happy , Billy , " said the grasshopper , " I guess you must have told your teacher all about it ! " " I did , " cried Billy , " but how did you know it would make me happy ? I did not think it would . " The grasshopper jumped over to another blade of grass , put his head on one side , and sang , " Oh , I am a grasshopper , very , very wise ! I know about everything underneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big hop , Billy could not see where he went . " Good-bye , " called Billy and then he said to his sad little toys , " just wait till I have had my dinner and helped my mother with the dishes and I will come out and play with you ! " and away he ran into the house , the happiest little boy in the world . * * * * * O ho ! Little boys and girls who are good ! You 've read these tales with me !
