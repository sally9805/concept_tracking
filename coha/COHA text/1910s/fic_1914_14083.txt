DINSMORE ( To the CLERK ) Swear them . CLERK ( To the JURORS ) Rise , gentlemen , and raise your right hands . ( They do so ) You and each of you do solemnly swear in the presence of the ever-living God , that you will well and truly try the indictment found by the people of the State of New York against Robert Strickland , and a true verdict rendered therein , according to the evidence , so help you God ! DINSMORE Proceed , Mr. Gray . GRAY ( Addressing the jury ) May it please the Court : Gentlemen of the Jury , this case is a very simple one . The facts , as they have appeared from time to time in the newspapers , are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refresh your recollections , however , I shall outline very briefly the circumstances which we shall put into evidence . Mr. Gerald Trask , as you know , was a prominent banker of this city . He was a distinguished member of the community , and occupied important places in the social and financial worlds . Among Mr. Trask 's acquaintances was Robert Strickland , the defendant . At the time they became acquainted Strickland was a rather prosperous business man , and he and Mr. Trask met frequently . Some months ago Strickland began to have business troubles . The cause of these difficulties does not concern us . But what does interest us , gentlemen , is that Strickland , becoming more and more involved , found it necessary to go to his friend , Gerald Trask , for financial assistance . Mr. Trask responded with his habitual generosity , and promptly loaned Strickland ten thousand dollars , taking the latter 's note as security . But Strickland 's business did n't improve , and he decided to migrate to the West . The note was payable on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the 22nd arrived , Strickland was in Cleveland , Ohio , making arrangements for himself and family . He returned , however , on the 24th , the night of the murder , sent for Mr. Trask , and took up the note . I call your attention to the fact , gentlemen , that Strickland paid the debt in cash . He was a business man . ( ARBUCKLE whispers to STRICKLAND ) p. 5 He did not pay it in check or draft , but cash ! Ten thousand dollars in cash ! Mr. Trask had offered to let the loan stand until Strickland was on his feet again , but Strickland would n't hear of it . You will understand his eagerness to cancel the debt in a moment , gentlemen ; it was because he had evolved a little plan whereby he could wipe out the obligation without it costing him a cent . The scheme was simple enough , gentlemen . He knew that Mr. Trask would have to keep the ten thousand in his house overnight , and that he would almost certainly lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is more , gentlemen , he knew the combination to Mr. Trask 's safe . Bear in mind that only two people knew the combination to that safe  --  Mr. Trask and Strickland . But Strickland had n't the nerve to do the job alone , so he called in an assistant . Accordingly , he and his accomplice entered Mr. Trask 's house a few hours after Strickland had paid over the money . The accomplice went to work on the safe and Strickland stood guard . The burglar succeeded without much difficulty in opening the safe and extracting the ten thousand dollars , while Strickland superintended the job . Before they could escape , however , they were interrupted , first by Mrs. Trask , and then by her husband . The accomplice made a hasty exit , taking the plunder with him . That was the last that was heard of the accomplice , gentlemen . Who he is or where he went we have been unable to learn . But Mr. Strickland was caught red-handed , and knowing that dead men tell no tales , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have the story , gentlemen . Mrs. Trask , the widow of the murdered man , will tell it to you in detail . Her testimony will be corroborated by Mr. Glover , Mr. Trask 's secretary , thanks to whose bravery the assassin was disarmed and captured , and who gave us material assistance in linking up the chain of evidence against him . Not one of the acts is disputed . Strickland , realizing the futility of interposing a defense , has refused  --   --  ARBUCKLE I object to that . ( Rises ) p. 6 DINSMORE Counsel will not interrupt . ( ARBUCKLE sits . ) GRAY Strickland , I say , has refused to make any effort to defend himself . When he was arraigned  --   --  ARBUCKLE I object to that . ( Rises . ) DINSMORE Counsel will not interrupt . ( ARBUCKLE. sits . ) GRAY When he was arraigned , he pleaded guilty to the indictment of murder in the first degree ; perhaps , gentlemen , you ask , if this is so , why are we here ? Why is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An expense which we taxpayers must meet in the end ? Why must you business men be taken from your occupations ; be compelled to lose valuable time ? Why is not the penalty allotted to murderers inflicted upon the defendant ? And in answer to that I say to you , because , gentlemen , the State is jealous of the lives of her citizens . To her the existence of an individual is sacred , no matter if he be depraved , degenerate , possessed of criminal instincts , dangerous to society . She will not allow even a self-confessed murderer to be put to death until twelve of his fellow-citizens , sitting in solemn judgment , calmly , dispassionately hearing and weighing the facts , have decreed that that man shall suffer the consequences of his crime . That is why we are here to-day , gentlemen . That is why His Honor has assigned such distinguished counsel to defend Strickland ; and that is why , before we ask you to visit upon this defendant the punishment he merits , we shall , by the unimpeachable testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peradventure of a doubt . Unfortunately , his partner in crime has made good his escape . But the greater criminal is in our hands , gentlemen . We shall make him pay the penalty of the law . I shall take up no more of your time . The facts will speak for themselves . ( Looks JURY over . He takes his seat , R. of table ) p. 7 ARBUCKLE ( Rising and addressing the JURY and standing along table ) If the Court pleases : Gentlemen of the Jury , when His Honor assigned me to the defense of this case , it seemed to me that the prosecution 's theory was untenable . I knew Mr. Strickland by reputation , and I scouted the burglary hypothesis . This belief strengthened as I became better acquainted with Mr. Strickland . A man of superlative honor and integrity , equipped with a splendid mentality and an excellent reputation , not addicted to bad habits or expensive luxuries , devotedly attached to his wife and child  --  that is not the sort of man who breaks into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case seemed to me to be not nearly so clear and simple as my friend , Mr. Gray , makes it out to be . But , despite my certainty that there lurked a mystery in this grim affair , I could learn nothing that would aid me in substantiating my belief . As my friend has told you , Mr. Strickland has maintained throughout an obstinate , unbreakable silence . In all my years at the bar , gentlemen , I have never encountered anyone who has declined so resolutely to yield to persuasion . Threats , entreaties and logic alike have left him indifferent . At last I reached the conclusion that Strickland was shielding someone , most likely the unknown accomplice who assaulted Mrs. Trask and broke open the safe . In the hope of learning the identity of this man , and , if possible , Strickland 's motive in shielding him , I endeavored to locate the members of Strickland 's family . Judge of my surprise gentlemen , when I learned that the defendant 's wife had disappeared from home on the night of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my attempts to find her have been fruitless . I have been forced to believe ( Pause  --  looks at STRICKLAND ) p. 8 that she took her life . I did succeed in finding Doris , the little daughter of the defendant . When you have heard her story , gentlemen , you will agree with me that to send Strickland to his death would be a gross miscarriage of justice . That is all for the present , gentlemen . ( He takes his seat ) STRICKLAND ( Has been seated at lower end of table L. Rising ) Your Honor , I wo n't have it . I wo n't have my little girl dragged into this case . I 've pleaded guilty . I 'm willing to suffer the consequences . ( ARBUCKLE entreats STRICKLAND to sit . ) DINSMORE Your case is in the hands of your counsel . STRICKLAND I do n't want counsel . I have no defense . Why do n't you sentence me ? Why  --  ? DINSMORE Proceed , Mr. Gray . STRICKLAND Your Honor  --   --  DINSMORE Silence ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( ATTENDANT opens door L. , exits , and calls MRS .

MAY ( Discovered on witness stand ) I do n't know what happened then ; ( Ring up ) I must have fainted . But the sound of that automobile went through my head for weeks . Soon after , father died . Then I met Robert  --   --  my husband . When I saw that he loved me , I tried to tell him about  --  about that terrible experience , but I was afraid of destroying his happiness . He would not have understood . Men do n't understand , and I loved him so . He seemed to need me and to need his belief in me . I came to realize I must never tell him . He was all that life meant to me . I wanted to devote my every thought to shielding him from the slightest unhappiness . Even though he was a strong man , he seemed to need my protection . Two years later we were married . I had begun to think of that awful experience only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  came . And I had two to watch over ; their happiness was my one aim in life . For nine years we three were so happy together . Then one day about a year ago , Robert mentioned that man 's name ; he had met him somewhere . I hoped that their acquaintance was only passing ; but they became more friendly . Robert spoke several times of having us meet , but for a year I avoided that meeting . Meanwhile Robert 's business troubles had begun . He  --  that man  --  lent him money and helped him in other ways . With their growing friendship I dreaded the wrecking of all our happiness . Then a business opportunity arose , which would take us from New York . I urged Robert to accept this , and he finally decided to . It seemed as if some power were guarding the happiness of my husband and baby . It was a Monday when Robert left for Cleveland . Tuesday night HE came . It was about the note which was due then . He recognized me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , saying that Robert would believe anything against me because of my long silence . He demanded that I come to his house at Long Branch the next day . I begged for mercy . I went down on my knees to him . I begged , and begged , and begged . He would n't even listen to me . He said he would ruin Robert and make a pauper of him . I was mad with fear . I did n't care for myself , I only thought of Robert and my baby . Their happiness was in my hands . I would have paid any price to shield them . If by dying I could have saved them , I would have died willingly . It would have been much easier than  --  but there was only one way , and I had to save them . Then Robert found out , and all my years of planning were shattered . Last evening , as I lay half-conscious in the hospital , I heard the nurses discussing the testimony of a little girl . I learned it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on trial for murder and burglary . They did n't want to let me go , but I made them understand that my husband might be put to death unless the truth were known . I 've told you the truth . Ca n't you understand ? He did n't go there to rob ; he did n't take the money . Robert 's not a thief . I am to blame . The fault is all mine . I 've ruined the lives of my husband and baby . God forgive me ! ( Ring curtain ) @x THE JURY ROOM FOREMAN Mr. Mathews . MATHEWS Not guilty . FOREMAN Mr. Adams . ADAMS Not guilty .

TOVELL That 's what we 're here for ! LEAVITT Of course we do . SUMMERS But rendering justice means something more than applying hard and fast rules of law .

We 're not machines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mechanical application of the Penal law . We 've got to attack this fron the human standpoint . We must try to put ourselves in Strickland 's place .

Ordinarily I do n't believe that there 's any justification for taking a human life . But this case is one in a thousand . This man Trask deliberately invaded his friend 's home  --  and wrecked it !

Just consider  --   --  p. 106 MOORE ( Down R. followed by LEEDS  --  Interrupting ) I think that you gentlemen are going off at a tangent . Unless I 'm greatly mistaken , Trumbull agrees with you that Strickland had ample justification for killing Trask . ( SUMMERS goes up R. C. ) LEEDS Then why 's he holding out ? TOVELL What 's keeping him back ? Let 's hear from you , Trumbull . FOREMAN Mr. Moore is right . I do think that Strickland had cause for killing Trask . If I had been placed in similar circumstances , I probably would have done the same thing . SUMMERS But still you vote for conviction . FOREMAN Yes , because I 'm not sure that Strickland went to Trask 's house solely because of his wife . I 'm inclined to think he also went there to rob the safe . LEEDS That 's nonsense ( Goes to chair and sits ) . FRIENDS Absurd ! TOVELL Strickland 's no burglar . ( Up stage R. ) . SUMMERS ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't really believe that , Trumbull .

FOREMAN ( Rises and stands R. ) I grant you all that , gentlemen ; but you ca n't dodge the facts . There 's a chain of circumstances woven around Strickland that , to my mind , would damn the Angel Gabriel . Just consider the facts . Strickland was hard pressed . He paid Trask the ten thousand dollars in cash . Why did n't he pay it by check like a business man ? He was the only one besides Trask who knew the combination of the safe . And he was on the spot when the safe was opened . Looks pretty bad , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course it looks bad ; but it 's all been explained . We know why Strickland went there . LEEDS Of course we do . FRIENDS Certainly ! TOVELL That 's all been cleared up ! ( Rises ) FOREMAN Well , if it 's all been explained , as you say it has , there are two things I 'd like you to explain to me . ( TOWELL sits ) . Firstly , how did the burglar open the safe ? SUMMERS He tampered with it . ( Starts L. ) p. 108 FOREMAN No , he did n't . The police officer testified that the tumblers were in perfect order . No , gentlemen , he opened the safe with the combination . And the only source from which he could learn the combination was Strickland . MOORE It does look pretty bad , I 'll admit that . JUROR ELLIOT Oh , I do n't know ! LEAVITT ( Sits on edge of table ) I do n't believe in circumstantial evidence ! MATHEWS Neither do I. TOVELL You ca n't convince me that Strickland 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's something else you 'll have to explain to my satisfaction before I vote for acquittal . SUMMERS What 's that ? FOREMAN Strickland had that combination on a card . The card was the only really incriminating evidence against him . If he 's innocent of the burglary , as you say he is , why did he attempt to destroy the card ? LEAVITT Who says he did ? TOVELL How do you know he did ? FOREMAN Why , here 's the card ! ( MOORE crosses to TRUMBULL ) Do n't you see that it 's torn almost in two ? And did n't Glover testify that it was Strickland who fore it ? p. 109 LEAVITT No ! ELLIOTT Yes ! LEEDS That 's right ! FRIENDS I do n't remember it ! TOVELL He did not ! FOREMAN Well , gentlemen , it seems to me it 's rather an important point . MOORE Yes , it is . I 'm glad you raised it . I 'm inclined to agree with you about it . FOREMAN There 's only one reason why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that is to wipe out the evidence that would be bound to convict him . SUMMERS I do n't believe he did attempt to destroy the card . LEAVITT Yes , he did ! LEEDS No ! TOVELL I do n't think Glover said so ! MOORE Wait a minute , I seem to remember Glover saying so .

( Sensation in the jury . ) FOREMAN You mean that you did n't tear the card ? STRICKLAND I did not . FOREMAN Do you know who did ? STRICKLAND No , sir . FOREMAN Did you know the card contained the combination to the safe ? STRICKLAND Not until I heard it yesterday in court . I saw some figures on the card , but they had no significance to me . I never thought of the card from the time I looked at the address on it until I saw it here in court .

( DR . MORGAN takes the stand. ) p. 115 ARBUCKLE Dr. Morgan , on the night of the shooting , did you examine the defendant ? DR . MORGAN Yes , sir . When I found that it was too late to do anything for Mr. Trask , I turned my attention to Mr. Strickland . ARBUCKLE In what condition did you find him ? DR . MORGAN He was lying on his back on the floor in a semi-conscious state , moaning with pain . ARBUCKLE Did you examine his arm ? DR . MORGAN Yes , sir ; I examined it very carefully while Mr. Glover and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describe the condition of the arm , please . DR . MORGAN The arm had been struck a terrific blow with a heavy cane . The blow fell squarely on the wrist , dislocating the wrist joint . Both bones of the forearm  --  the radius and the ulna  --  were badly fractured . It was one of the worst fractures I have ever seen . ARBUCKLE Now , Dr. Morgan , in your opinion , could the defendant have torn this card , as you see it here , between the time his arm was broken and the time you arrived ? DR . MORGAN He could not . ARBUCKLE You are sure of that ? DR . MORGAN Yes ! The hand was entirely paralyzed . It would have been a physical impossibility , assuming even that his mental state would have permitted it .

It was in his coat pocket you found it , I believe ? GLOVER Yes ; side pocket . ARBUCKLE ( Down-stage ) p. 117 Now , if you do n't mind , I 'd just like to have you describe that scene in detail . Where was Mr. Strickland ? GLOVER He was on the floor , lying on his back . ARBUCKLE And you were standing over him ? GLOVER Yes . ARBUCKLE On which side of him ? GLOVER The right side . ARBUCKLE And as you bent over him and went through his pockets , did he make any attempt to prevent you ? GLOVER Oh , yes ; he tried to push me away . ARBUCKLE I see , he kept warding you off like this , huh ? ( Indicating with right arm as if pushing someone away ) GLOVER Yes . ARBUCKLE Finally , however , you succeeded in getting the card ?

GLOVER All right ; I 'll let you know when you make a mistake . ARBUCKLE Thank you , that 's very good of you . Now there was something else . I must ask you to be just a little patient with me . GLOVER Certainly . ARBUCKLE ( Down-stage ) Oh , yes ! Strickland snatched the card , then he tore it . Now , how did he tear it ? GLOVER How ? What do you mean ? ARBUCKLE Well , I mean , did he tear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly , because I snatched it out of his hand almost instantly . ARBUCKLE Oh ! I see . Now let 's get that straight . Strickland had the card in his left hand  --  like this . Right ? GLOVER Yes . ARBUCKLE And he was supporting himself on his right elbow  --  like this . Yes ? GLOVER Yes . ARBUCKLE Then he made a quick backward movement  --  like this  --  tearing the card almost in half . That 's right , is n't it ? GLOVER That 's right . ARBUCKLE I see . And then you snatched the card away from him ? GLOVER Yes . ARBUCKLE And he threatened you , did n't he , as you took the card ? GLOVER Yes . He swore at me and said he 'd fix me . ARBUCKLE And if I remember correctly , you said that he made a quick pass for the revolver  --  like this ? Yes ? GLOVER Yes ; but it was out of his reach .
