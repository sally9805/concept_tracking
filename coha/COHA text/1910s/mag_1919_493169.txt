The Treaty and International Law T REATIES of peace are written to register the results of war , not to advance international law ; still , they afford an opportunity for strengthening or weakening established principles . In the last one hundred years there has grown up a tolerably constant practice of equitable disposition of minor standing points of settlement : prisoners , amnesty , treaty relations , private rights , civil status , future trade and commerce , and so forth . This practice has been an expression of a sense of equity , and an approximation to law . French writers commenting on the peace of 1871 recognize that it presented " nothing contrary to the diplomatic usages which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , II 366 ) , and speak of concessions made " for the honor of principle . " ( May , 2.68 ) . Indeed , equality and reciprocity dominate the secondary arrangements of the peace of 1871 . The stipulations concerning repatriation of prisoners , and the provisions on behalf of nationals formerly residing in the enemy country , are the same for both sides ; the revival of former treaties is mutual ; the most favored nation clause is made ' to operate against Germany as well as against France ; the rights of navigation on the Moselle are equal and reciprocal ; the French prize decrees are confirmed ; France gets an allowance on her indemnity for her railroads in Alsace-Lorraine ( a similar payment now being refused " ie view of the terms on which Alsace-Lorraine was ceded to Germany in 1871 " ) ; Germany assumes civil and military pensions payable by France t ? Alsace-Lorrainers at the outbreak of the war . The annexation of Alsace-Lorraine itself , on the other hand , was an act of violence , made plausible to the German people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and while no firmly estab ' lished rule required a plebiscite in connection with it , such a plebiscite would have been in accordance , with then recent French precedents . It would 0 ' course have defeated the German purpose . In tilde present treaty the annexation is spoken of an treated as a wrong . How does the present treaty conform to trail ' ' tional practice ? This question should give concer s even to those who uphold as justified by GermarlYd wrongs the " terrible severity " ( to use Mr. Liol George 's words ) of the peace terms . Ha rsinic5s d is one thing , inequity another . We are prepares for harshness ( waiving the question of previ ? ti pledges ) in the matter of reparation or indemnity ' cession of territory , surrender of political or 011. ; itary power ; we look for equity in the treatinee * By act of May 3r , rgor , Germany made Prof for payment of pensions to Alsace-Lorrainers wh ? 187o-71 had fought on the side of France . December 17 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquidation of war measures , and the ordering of future peaceful relations . No unbiased student of the Treaty can deny that in these points it compares unfavorably with any of its predecessors . Reciprocity is the rare exception ; even in such a purely humanitarian matter as information concerning prisoners only Germany is made to assume an obligation ( 222 ) , and only an Allied commission is recognized in the identification and care of graves ( 225 ) . It is particularly in Part X , entitled Economic Clauses , that one is struck by the studious disregard of any equities that Germany might have pleaded in her behalf . Whether it be war measures or acts in the regular course of government , such as judgments ? what the Allies and their associates have done is sanctioned and confirmed , what the Germans have done is repudiated or left open for repudiation . The Allies determine whether contracts pending at the outbreak of the war are to be fulfilled or not ; the arrangement adopted for the settlement of debts is at the option of each Allied government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed arbitral tribunals , except where by the law of an Allied state its local tribunals are competent ? while no such reservation is made for Germany . The restoration of former treaties is entirely at the option of each Allied government . In about a dozen different cases it is stipulated that future treaties or arrangements to be Made by the Allies are accepted in advance by Germany without any knowledge of their contents . In plebiscite or frontier determinations Germany is either not represented at all or is left in a minority ; she is also provisionally barred from any place on the Danube Commission . In the reestablishment of commercial relations everything is one sided to the disadvantage of Germany ; not even China has ever been subjected to an equally exploiting and humiliating treatment . Even where no substantial gain is to be expected ( as e. g. in the discriminative recognition of certificates or subjection to inspection , 272 , 273 ) , the assumption is that German action will be tainted with suspicion . Italy , Rumania , Serbia , not to speak of certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their governmental acts which is denied to Germany , whose legislation and administration have been regarded by competent students as models of scrupulous and reliable accuracy . The climax is fittingly capped by a blanket clause whereby Germany waives any pecuniary claim based on events preceding the Treaty , not only as against enemy states , but against those which without having declared war , had broken off diplomatic relations . It would be impossible to understand these terms without bearing constantly in mind the extreme resentment felt against Germany for ruthless conduct of the war and wanton devastation ; but that does not adequately explain them . The impression received is that draftsmen had general instructions to make all possible reservations in favor of the Allies while conceding nothing to the other side , that these instructions were carried out to the letter , and that after the instrument had been completed , the responsible chiefs refused a discussion of detail from an unwillingness to be drawn into a discussion of major arrangements . Two phases of the Treaty deserve special notice . The one relates to the taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vestige of the fruits of German commercial and industrial enterprise in the Allied and associated countries , in the former German colonies , and in the Orient . It is true that the value of the property appropriated is credited on the reparation bill ; but if this act of spoliation is otherwise indefensible , can it be justified by the existence of an obligation to indemnify which Germany had undertaken to discharge ? Will anyone think it strange if Germans are confirmed in the belief that commercial jealousy was one of the underlying motives of the war ? It also remains to be seen whether this part of the Treaty can be carried into full effect in this country without violating constitutional provisions of our own . From questionable profit we turn to profitless indignity . The defeated enemy is made expressly to accept the entire responsibility for the war . What is the moral value of such a confession forced from an unconvinced opponent who is incapable of resistance , even if it were the whole truth and nothing but the truth ? We spurn to get such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be brought to trial ; cui bono ? Distinguished English jurists , among them a former Lord Chancellor , have protested against this , and America might well have joined in the protest against a proceeding which proposes to violate every principle of penal law and legislation for which she has stood since the beginning of her government . It may seem to betray a sense of disproportion to dwell on provisions of the Treaty which will count for relatively little in the sum total of Germany 's ruin and disaster . But the point is this : the struggle for power is one thing , the struggle for law another , Taking a long view it is easier to acquiesce in an exaction of the extreme price of defeat than in an impairment of traditional equity . Structures of power are impermanent , wealth that is lost may be recreated , but a record of inequity is never altogether wiped out . It has been cynically // said that a ' statesman may commit a crime , but must not commit a blunder . Against this we may well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil than the setting down of wrong as right and the consequent lowering of general standards . There is a deep seated loyalty to ideals , however recreant we may be to them in practice . Nothing in the recent war set the tide of public sentiment so much against Germany as the violation of the obligation of treaties by the invasion of Belgium . Yet the attempt of certain German jurists to justify the act by pleading the law of necessity as a qualification of International Law was a more discreditable proceeding . A resentment of this kind is a legitimate human reaction , and not , it is hoped , peculiar to the professional lawyer . If ever in the history of the world , it is important now when almost every nation is facing social readjustment at home , to hold fast to those tempering principles of fairness and reciprocity by which in the course of time the race for power and advantage had come to be moderated . The makers of the Treaty of Versailles have set a bad example . International Law , flouted and discredited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peace . Will the League of Nations undo the harm that has been done ? The League is partly an achievement and partly a promise . The achievement is the setting up of a machinery for the settlement of disputes and for joint action . This machinery ? composition , structure , method of procedure ? is concededly defective and will have to be altered radically before there can be confidence in the carrying out of promises . The promise is to be found in the program of action . The larger part of this is negative , the prevention or postponement of wars , borrowed from the Leage to Enforce Peace . The positive program should be the elimination of the causes of war . That part is meager indeed . The principle of the mandate is the one great addition to International Law , and with all its one-sidedness and its loopholes should receive ungrudging welcome and applause . For the rest the Covenant scrupulously eliminates from its jurisdiction everything that makes for privilege and inequality among the peoples of the world and perpetuates as far as lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refers to non-contentious subjects long since recognized as the field of international convention and action ; labor , protection of natives , control of immoral traffic , prevention of disease , and even for these , instead of holding out joint action , contents itself with promises on the part of members of the League . True , there is also a promise of the same kind to make provision for freedom of communications and of transit and for equitable treatment for the commerce of all mem bers of the League . But any nation may safely subscribe to so vague a pledge without committing itself to anything . Those who look for something more specific are advised to turn from what the League promises for itself or for its members to what the Treaty imposes on Germany . There seems to be no objec-tion to advancing international law where it involves only a sacrifice of enemy interests . Overlooking the one-sidedness , there is good sense and hope for progress in the military and economic regime imposed on Germany . History shows that servitudes of this kind , being naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the first opportunity . But the permanently important thing is that a new precedent has been set for the international limitation of sovereign powers . Applied in the past only to oriental countries , limitations of a similar kind have failed to make a great impress upon international law and practice . They become far more important when imposed upon the very heart of Europe and as a means of supporting the new political system there established . The new Slavic states merely promise to embody in a treaty with the Allied Powers such provisions as these powers may deem necessary to protect freedom of transit and equitable treatment of the commerce of other nations . Equitable treatment may mean anything or nothing ; freedom of transit , unless it includes a guarantee against measures of political blockade and quarantine , is already voluntarily accorded in international practice as beneficial to all parties alike . Hence these promises mean little . Germany , in addition to the freedom of transit , assumes definite obligations with regard to the organization of through services , non-discrimination on the basis of nationality in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign and German ports , international freedom of German inland navigation , and most favored nation treatment . But these obligations are tempered by an important . concession which must not be overlooked . Article 378 * provides that they shall be subject to revision by the Council of the League after five years or such longer period as the council may determine , failing which revision an Allied or associated power will enjoy the benefit of the stipulations only on condition of reciprocity . The inequity so characteristic of the Treaty which ' puts everything in the discretion of the Allies appears in the vagueness of the term " revision " and in the power of indefinitely prolonging the period of non reciprocity . On the other hand the clause reveals the defectiveness of the League machinery . Since * Article 33o of the Austrian Treaty is substantially the same . December 17 , 1919 THE NEW the action of the council must be unanimous there is slight chance for a revision ( whatever that term may mean ) , but also a very reasonable chance of lion-prolongation . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will cease to operate or will operate reciprocally . It is not at all unlikely that the new Slavic states Will accept reciprocity rather than forego advantages some of which are to them of vital importance . In fact , in the American treaty the condition of reciprocity is immediately imposed upon the states formed out of former Austro-Hungarian territory . The Treaty also places the new Slavic states ceder obligations as to the treatment of national Minorities . If economic obligations are added , we 81141 have the spectacle of a Central Europe organized into separate states which are subjected to an entirely novel international regime of reciprocal restrictions upon sovereignty . This is a ? ? Peful feature of the new situation . Of less practical , but greater potential significance , is the extension of the principle of reciprocity Under article 378 to all other states which are Parties to the Treaty . Here is the first step toward tile recognition of the fact that the peace of the 7 ? rid requires universal economic concessions .
