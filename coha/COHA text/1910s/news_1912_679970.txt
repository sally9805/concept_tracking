txt A wireless dispatch received to-night by the Allan line officials here from Capt . Gambell of the steamer Virginian. states that the White Star liner Titanic struck an iceberg off the Newfoundland Coast and flashed out wireless calls for immediate assistance . The Virginian put on full speed and headed for the Titanic . No particulars have been received as to the extent of the damage sustained by Titanic . The Virginian sailed from Halifax at midnight on Saturday night , and would probably be 300 miles off this coast when she picked up the calls from the Titanic for assistance . The Allan liner has only about 200 passengers on board and would have ample accommodations for a large number of persons in case a transfer from the TI ' ta.nic was necessary . The Virginian is a mail steamer , and so she is not likely to 1 , take the Titanic in tow . MONTREAL. , April ** new White Star liner Titanic is reported in advices received here late to-night to have struck an iceberg . The news was received at the Allan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the steamer Virginian oti that line .

The Virginian sailed from Halifax-this ) morning , and at the time the wirelesRS was sent she is reckoned to have been . about abeam of Cape Race . She hap 20d passengers on board , but can accommodate 000 more of the Titanic 's passengers should their removal be necessary . The message from the Virginian 's Captain was sent by wireless to Cape Race , and thence by cable to Halifax . and then by wire to Montreal . The Allan Line officials here expect to hear further news at any moment . OTHER SHIPS WITHIN CALL . Many Near the Titanic 's Course Prominent Persons Aboard .

She entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was me everywhere , according to the passengers , the great cakes being so closely jammed together that it was impossible co see a crevice between them . A heavy swell prevailed at the time , and the passengers described the upward and downaard motion of the ice as both beautiful and weird . The sun was shining brightly and the glitter of the ice field made the spectacle all the more magnificent . Picks Up Niagara 's Call for Help . For three hours the Carmania was in the sea of ice , and at times as far as the i eye could see there was nothing but ice , with here and there a great berg to break the monotony of the picture . One berg - was described as being like a great mountain of chalk , and one of the passengers said it looked to be about 40,000 tons in size . When Capt . Dow was asked about this he said the passenger had been far toe conservative , and then added laughingly . " Forty million tons would be more like it . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chalk-colored berg . She passed within a quarter of a mile of it , and the passengers all agreed they never had seen anything more beautiful . Another big berg stood out conspicuously in a fleet of twenty-five bergs because of the fact that its ' top was a perfect plateau that appeared to be as smooth as a billiard table . The twenty-five big bergs were grouped in a comparatively small area , andeall of them were in view from one side or the other of the liner all the time . Six were lined up in majestic fashion on the hole : zon . Many of them were only a few hundred yards away whee . the Carmania , proceeding at what the official- log calls ' dead slow , " passed them . Capt Dow never left the bridge s. second during the hours he was feeling his way through the ice , and the sirens of the liner were constantly sounding out the warning of the ship 's progress for the benefit of other ships that might be in the same fix but not in view . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big as the Carmania to have been within hearing distance of the siren and yet have been hidden from view by one of the big bergs . Miss Claudia Sturm , one of the Carmania 's young women passengers , said yesterday that she had never seen anything so grand and inspiring as the great ice field and the big bergs that dotted it . " It was beautiful , " she said , " but it was mighty scary . The heaving up and down of the ice because of the great swells was awe inspiring , and I was glad when we got back into clear water where there was no field ice and no bergs. " 1,000 Passengers on Damaged Liner . The Carman 's , still was in the ice pack when the wireless message from the Captain of the French liner Niagara was received . In that message the French skipper said that two holes had been stove in the Niagara below tn water line . The Carmania , which had been compelled to change her course in order to set free of the ice field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position when the second message was revolved , saying that the liner would be awe to continue without any assistance , and it is presumed that the crew was able to effect repairs without outside aid , although some of the passengers said that a message had been received to the effect that another liner was alongside the Niagara . Capt . Dow after the Carmania docked met the reporters with a smile . " Really , " he said . " I never saw so much ice and so little whisky and lime juice in al my life before . Had the ingredients been handy , there would have been a highball for every man in the world . " I entered the ice field , " the skipper went on , " on a southwest course , anti when I saw the extent of the field I tried to find a northwest passage out of it . Failing to find one , I was compelled to follow a northeast course , in order to get clear of the ice . In other words , it was necessary for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The ice was on an sides of me , and was trembling , undulating , and rasping , and every once in a while we would run across a growler . " " What 's a growler ? " Capt . Dow was asked . " It is a piece of ice , " he replied , " that has become detached from a berg or larger piece of ice , and which , beating against the larger pieces , makes the sound that we call the ice growl . " " How about that plateau berg the passengers are telling about ? " was another question put to the skipper . " Yes , that is right . It was a wonderful sight , and when I first saw it I thought for a moment it was the - hulk of a ship , but after we passed it I saw the green reflection , and that , of course , set my doubts at rest , " he answered . " In three hours , " continued Capt . Dow , " on Thursday afternoon we passed twenty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the bridge I am seventy feet above the water line , yet there were times when I could not see a thing but ice , and at no time did I see a piece of ice that was smaller than a lifeboat . We passed a full-rigged ship in the field . She was nodding in the swell , bobbing up and down , but apparently seas in no danger . " Soon after the sailing ship was passed the Carmania passed a fishing smack , which , like the big sailer , was fast in the ice and curtseying with the swell . When the Carmania cleared the ice field she ran into a dense fog , and had to come almost to a dead stop . The fog soon lifted , however , and the liner headed full speed for New York , arriving off the Hook only a few hours behind her schedule . The Niagara probably has 1,000 passengers on board . On her last voyage this way she brought 976 . The Excelsior , which arrived from Rotterdam yesterday , reported an experience in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She also reported seeing a sailing ship fast in the ice . This is believed to be the same ship sighted by the Carmania . THE CARMANIA 'S PASSENGERS . Capt . Fermor-Hesketh , Whose Brother Disappeared , Among Them . The Cunarder Carmania had among her passengers Mr. and Mrs. H. M. T. Beekman , Patrick Francis Murphy , Capt . and Mrs. T. Ferrnor-Hesketh , the Right Rev. Bisnop I. B. Scott of the Methodist Episcopal Church . Sir Charles Ross , and Ronald Lambert Tree . Capt . Fermor-Hesketh is a brother of American Line is due here to-morrow , and should be close enough to reach the Titanic In a ' few hours ' . - steaming . The Canarder Mauretania , the fastest vessel in the world , is also bound this way and should have , been within the Titanic 's wireless zone . To the southeast of her and also bound westward at noon on Sunday was the Prinz Adelbert of the Hamburg-American Line , bound from Hamburg for Philadelphia . A little west of the Prinz Adel-bert and to the southward was the Steiermark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south of the latter was the Amerika was the Prinz Friedrich WilPlymouth . To the direct west of the Amerika was the rPinz Friedrich Wilhelm , the North German Lloyd liner , bound from this port to Plymouth In her vicinity and directly south was the White Star Line steamship Baltic . The last report received in New York from the Titanic was at 2:15 A. AL yesterday . Shewasthen 1,2S4 miles east of Sandy Hook , and In that message her commander said that lie expected to reach New York in time to dock late to-morrow afternoon . Since that message no word was received from the Titanic until the news from Montreal last night . The Titanic undoubtedly ran into the same ice field off- the Grand Banks that was reported by the Cunarder Carmania on her arrival yesterday . The ice was so thickly jammed that crevices between the pieces could not be seen , and great icebergs , to the number of at least twenty-five , were drifting about in the field . The French liner Niagara , which is due here to-day , encountered the ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holes stove below the water line . The steamers Kura and Lord Cromer , both of which have arrived in New York in the last few days , were damaged in making their way through the ice packs . Last Wednesday when the Titanic left Southampton for New York a disaster was narrowly averted as the Titanic passed from her berth out into the open stream . The big liner sucked the water between herself and the quay to such a degree that the strain broke the hawsers with which the American liner New York was moored to the quayside . For a while it looked as if the two vessels would qollide . The New York drifted helplessly stern first toward the Titanic and had not the Titanic reversed her engines and come to a dead stop it is certain that the Titanic would not now be on her way to New York . Tugs that were near by steamed to the aid of the New York and pulled her back to the quay . As seen as the New York was made fast the Titanic got under way toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Star Line at the foot of Twentieth Street , North River . It was stated at 1:20 o'clock this morning that up to that time the line had not received any word from the Titanic beyond the information conveyed in press dispatches . The Titanio is a luxuriously fitted ? out . vessel . One may get an idea as to the immensity of the Titanic when it is known that in length she will stretch over four city blocks and would be considerably over 100 feet higher , standing on her end , than the highest building in New Zork . The vessel has accommodations for 3,500 passengers and carries a crew of 860 . She was built in the River Laffan at Belfast and was launched May 31 of last year . Among those who saw her take the water was J. Pierpont Morgan . Capt . Smith , the commander of the Titanic , was in command of the Titanic 's sister ship Olympic at the time of her collision with the cruiser Hawke in the Solent last September . CARMANIA IN ICE FIELD . Heard Niagara Calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice field in which there are many bergs , some of them mountain-like In size , and in which three ocean steamships are known to have been damaged , and at least one full-rigged ship and one fishing smack are imprisoned , has drifted into the westbound transatlantic track about 1.000 miles east- of Sandy Hook . The Cunarder Carmania , in yesterday from Liverpool , ran into this ice field . Although the big vessel got out without damage , she nevertheless had a perilous time while in the field , and everybody breathed easier when the bergs had been left tiehind . The French liner Niagara , from Havre , ran into the ice about the same time as the Carmania. but she did not have the good luck of the Curnarder . The Niagara , which is due to arrive here this morning , had two holes knocked in her , bottom , and many of her plates dented and twisted . At one time her Captain considered his condition so serious that he wirelesses : o the Carmania for help . The Carmania was on her way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been patched up and would be able to proceed without assistance . Fur a week the ice field has covered the westbound track off the Grand Banks , alai besides the Carmania and the Niagara , the steamers Excelsior , Kura , and Lord Cromer , which have arrived at New York . and the Armenian , which arrived at Boston , have reported battles with the Ice . The Lord Cromer and the Kura were damaged below the water line . The Kura had about twenty-five of her plates ripped off , while the Lord Cramer had about the same number dented and otherwise damaged . The Armenian reported Lieut . Fermor-Hesketh of the . Royal Fusiliers , who disappeared in October , 1910 , and not one word of whom has since been heard . Lieut . Hesketh was last seen on board a steamer bound from Holyhead to Kingstown , Ireland . Recently it was reported that he had been seen in Montana and an investigation was made . Capt . Fermor-Hesketh received a cablegram from his mother when he landed yesterday , telling him that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferrnor-Hesketh is a candidate for Parliament from the Heywood district of Lancashire . He says he believes a new election will be called on the Home Rule bill and that if it is the Unionists will succeed to power . With his wife , who was a Miss Breckinridge of San Francisco , he is on his way West to visit relatives . Others on the Carmania were Capt . E. C. Bald , G. C. Black , Gilbert W. Ireland , Mr. and Mrs. H. P. Pennock , E. S. Powells , Jr. , Mr. and Mrs. William M. Ramsdell , Ingersoll D. Townsend , Mr. and Mrs. A. Sturm , the Misses- Sturm , and A. M. Tree . ? LINERS THAT HAVE HIT BERGS . Columbia and Kronprinz Wilhelm Were in Collisions on Way Here . The last big passer r steamship to come into port after an en enter with an iceberg was the Anchor /in r Columbia , from Glasgow . The collision between the steamship and the iceberg happened on Aug. 2 , 1911 , - in a dense fog when the vessel was 150 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ice fell upon her forecastle and her stem was smashed into the water line and the upper part of her bow plates was driven back ten feet . Mre . Elizabeth Ogilvie , a passenger , was knocked down and had an ankle broken . Several members of the crew received minor injuries . The North German Lloyd liner Kronprinz Wilhelm collided with an iceberg on July 8 , 1907 , while plowing her way through the darkness of the early morning . The vessel showed the marks of the collision ' on her arrival here two days later . Her bow was dented and along her starboard side were the marks made by the mass of ice that scraped her length , taking off the paint . The collision took place off the Banks and the Kronprinz Wilhelm was making nearly 16 knots . It is palpable that this reduced speed did much to avert a more serious accident . On her Western trip from Rotterdam the steamship Volturno had a narrow escape from the ice in May , 1909 . While off Newfoundland the horizon from the deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as she entered into the field she was " pinched " by the moving ice . Great pieces went grinding along her sides and there was much excitement on board . On May 9 an iceberg was reported off the starboard bow . Hardly had this berg passed astern than another came down upon her . The skipper managed to keep her from colliding with the great masses of ice that went past , some so close that great chunks of ice fell upon the Volturno 's deck . The vessel came to a stop in the fog and when this lifted she lay in a narrow strip of water , inclosed in a horseshoe mass of ice .
