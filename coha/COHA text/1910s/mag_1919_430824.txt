 |p770  BEFORE American history began , the Abenaki Indians had a village on the banks of the Kennebec some eighty-five miles above its mouth . They called it Nanrantsouak , and this we have altered to Norridgewock . In the seventeenth century it was a collection of some twenty-six birchbark wigwams surrounded by a stockade , the homes of two hundred savages . To this village in the wilderness , in 1694 , came Sebastian Rale , a Jesuit priest , then thirty-seven years old . He was born in Franche-Comte , a part of the old Duchy of Burgundy that finally became French territory in 1674 , when he was a lad of sixteen studying in Dijon . After becoming a Latin scholar , an instructor in Greek , a quiet student , he left this peaceful life behind him ; and on October 13 , 1689 , he landed at Quebec to become a missionary to the Indians . Immediately on his arrival he devoted himself to the study of the Indian tongue , and in 1691 he began to compile a dictionary of Abenaki . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain the rest of his life . By 1698 he had built a church , the decorations being carved by his own hand . That a Jesuit should minister to the Indians so near to the English settlements was both a disgrace and a menace in the eyes of the Puritan . The Indian had his apologists in many towns removed a bit from the frontier , but in those days the Jesuit was looked upon by all as an unmixed evil . Jesuits and Popish priests were warned to depart from the Colonies , and when Rale ignored the mandate of the Massachusetts Court , an expedition was sent to capture him . But Rale and his Indians had fled , and all that the effort accomplished was the destruc-  |p771  tion of the bark village and the burning of the church . The church being rebuilt and two chapels added , another attempt was made to get Rale , in 1722 , and again he escaped , but so hurriedly that his strongbox containing his dictionary and correspondence was captured , and this loot was carried back to Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1724 better fortune attended the enemies of Rale . The village was surprised and few of the savages escaped , while Rale himself fell dead at the foot of the cross he had planted in the centre of the settlement . His body was mutilated , and his scalp torn off and carried in triumph to Boston , with similar mementoes from the heads of twentysix Indians . The survivors straggled back to their ruined homes and reverently buried the torn body of their priest . Our historians deny to Rale the ascription of martyrdom , insisting that he was killed because he was an active agent of the French government , not as an apostle of his faith . But after all there never yet was a martyr who was not proclaimed an enemy to the state by those who slew him . Nanrantsouak was abandoned , and the few survivors of the massacre found refuge in other villages of their tribe . Their kinsmen in Maine are the Yankees of their race . Sober and industrious , they still make various trinkets out of birchbark , sedge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resorts throughout the North , complacently telling their customers that they are of the Saratoga , Niagara , or Narragansett tribe , depending only upon where they are . This pleases the buyer , increases sales , and does no one any harm . On the first page of the manuscript dictionary there is written in a contemporary hand , " Taken after the fight at Norridgewalk among father Ralle 's Papers and given by the late Col. Heath to Elisha Cooke , Esq. ? Dictionary of the Norridgewalk Language . " The manuscript is now  |p772  in the Library of Harvard University . In 1833 the matter was printed as written in the " Memoirs of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences " under the editorship of John Pickering . When Rale was on the banks of the Chaudiere in 1691 he began the composition of this dictionary , and as it was intended solely for his own use , he indulged in many abbreviations , and his spellings tend at times to obscure his meaning . He was quite competent to perform the task he had undertaken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had a natural aptitude for language , and he took great pains to render a sound as nearly as possible as it came to him . Thus he uses no less than eight variations of a ? as a , a , a , a , a , a , a . And he is almost as generous with the other vowels . He uses an 8 to indicate what he calls a guttural , as it is sounded wholly from the throat without any motion of the lips . Others use for this sound u , oo , ou , or w . For instance , Rale spells the Indian word moose " m8s , " and as it is evidently derived from the call of the animal , it is clear that Rale 's spelling is better than ours . In his alphabet he does not use c , f , 1 , q , w , x , and y ( though c and l are introduced in a few words constructed by Rale himself ) , while the 8 and the Greek letters e and x @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kh into x , g he alters to k , and b to p , thus showing the keenness of his ear , and the care which he exercised . Father Rale complains that the Indian tongues are very difficult , their genius and scope being quite different from that of our European languages . Yet on some points the Indians expressed themselves in. similar terms . In a letter to his brother written in 1723 , he says : " If I should ask you , Why has God created you ? ' you would reply to me that it is to know him , to love him , and by this means to merit eternal glory . ' But should I put the same question to a savage , he would reply to me thus , in the terms of his language : The great spirit has thought of us : Let them  |p773  know me , let them love me , let them honor me , and let them obey me ; for then I shall make them enter into my glorious felicity . ' " When it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only on the accuracy of ear of the listener , but also upon the tongue of the speaker , and the recorder naturally gives the letters the sound of his own language . This we must expect and make allowances for , but we are almost as much hampered by the good priest 's French . Ile may have spelled according to the custom of his age , but , if so , the manners of the day were bad , for his spelling of French was as atrocious as John Milton 's reckless efforts at English . In his dictionary the religious passages are perhaps the most puzzling , and how the priest devised Abenaki equivalents for some of his phrases passes one 's comprehension . " Ash Wednesday " he is satisfied to render with the Indian words for " Holy ashes , " while " Grace abounding " is really " wait a little . " He has given the Indian for " 0 generation of vipers , " and the nearest he can get to vipers is of course " snakes . " This must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hosts of similar difficulties , and translates into Abenaki such phrases as the Circumcision , Twelfth Night , Palm Sunday , Passover , Pentecost , Corpus Christi , Conception , and the like . What a hazy idea of it all the Indians must have had ! Then there is " I give him extreme unction , " duly produced in Indian . What sort of notion could these words convey to the hearers ? Of a surety one respects the nerve of the pastor . He gives good Indian for " du mauvais riche , " for even an aborigine would disapprove of the man who had the most fertile part of the corn field . " Thou wilt pay in hell eternally , " would be understood by any savage , and be rather comforting , when addressed to another . All of us appreciate the idea of hell and realize that not enough people go there . Many , who are by no means savages , have no expectation of meeting  |p774  either father or husband in heaven , though they may respect both profoundly . One quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere list of words , as from it one can glean a fair notion of the daily life of the people . Thus , they danced and sang , fought , gambled , played games , and chewed spruce gum . They were amused at feats of jugglery , and they spun tops and played blind man 's buff . Their table manners were not above reproach . It was good form with them to polish the dish with the fingers and then lick the fingers with the tongue . If one 's food was too hot he chilled it by blowing upon it , by stirring it , or by putting it in another dish . The daintier mode , of fanning it with the hat , seems not to have occurred to them . " Nemetawe , " exclaimed an Abenaki at table , and by that he meant , " I am angry when one gives me the smallest part . " Rale ever had his medicine-chest handy ; but results were as doubtful as they are to-day or he would not have needed the phrase , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of bleeding is described particularly , and the leach seems to have been domesticated amongst the Abenaki . The forms attending marriage are set forth in detail , and the giving of presents was an integral part . A kettle , a skin , and a string of beads seem to have been the most common . Cleanliness does not appear to have concerned the Abenaki seriously , for " I bathe myself " appears but once , and " clean your face " also stands alone . Under washing we have phrases referring to baptism and the cleaning of vegetables , with but scant reference to the body . Soap was known , but its use was evidently uncommon . The signs of misery are not wanting , and " I am hungry " is repeated again and again . " We have a horrible malady " and " the disease runs through the village , " were phrases doubtless often used . " It rains in the cabin and puts out the fire , " is bad enough , but " I have great fear " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is well to turn to the other side of the picture and read . " I am happy , I live well , I want nothing , I try to please , I have joyful thoughts , I smile at him and I let him smoke my pipe . " We must realize that it was Sebastian Rale , the Jesuit , who brought much of this happiness into camp . There is scarcely an end to the expressions indicating ferocity , and nearly all seem to be part of the daily life of the Abenaki , not merely for use in war against an enemy . " I tear out his tongue , I put out his eyes , I choke him , I strangle him , I starve him , I bite his ear , I beat him to death , I make him weep beating him , and I cease making him weep , having fear of him " ? evidently the victim was growing up . The Indian uses poison as a weapon , and kills secretly . With an outside enemy he says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill all , " which shows that the Germans were not the first to make war efficiently . As with the German also , deceit was a favorite weapon of the Indian and he exclaims proudly , " See how I deceive him , " but after all he is constrained to add , " I gain nothing by deceiving him . " Had we nothing but this dictionary of Rale 's to guide us , we still should be assured that corn was the chief food of the Indian . Much space is devoted to the word , and the process of clearing the land by fire or otherwise , the planting , cultivating , and handling of the crop are all given minutely , showing the drying , grinding , and removing the hull with lye to make hominy . From the corn they made flour , porridge , bread , and pie ? which like all good New Englanders they doubtless ate at breakfast . For meat they depended most upon the caribou and moose , for deer were apparently not plentiful . Indeed , they have only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been killed or driven out . Moose tongue was a delicacy , and the feet were also esteemed . They ate the beaver ; and birds , of course , were used , ducks and the Canada goose , called the bustard , being particularly mentioned . Chickens are  |p776  not named at all and eggs do not appear as an article of diet . The piece de resistance at a feast seems to have been the dog , though the Iroquois is also noted , but the latter did not hold a high place on the menu , only those conspicuous for bravery being utilized . Fish were plentiful , and the salmon , trout , eel , and others are named , with some others that can not be identified . Eels appear to have been the most favored , and at certain seasons they were caught in the river near camp . Of vegetables , potatoes held first place , and they had also the Jerusalem artichoke , but Rale uses the same Indian word for both , " penak . " Pumpkins , beans , peas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had apples , plums , cherries , grapes , currants , strawberries , raspberries , and watermelons , but there is no suggestion that any of these were cultivated . They ate the hazelnut , walnut , chestnut , beechnut , and acorn , and more is said of the acorn than of any of the others . They made soups and salted down , dried , or smoked meats and fish . At times they ate the flesh raw , but it was usually roasted at the fire , while the bread was wrapped in leaves and baked in the embers . They had at least names for milk , butter , cheese , lard , salt , and sugar , but as most of these are derived from English words they had but scant use of the articles . Maple syrup and sugar were , of course , ancient articles of Indian diet . They had not much to drink save water ? some wine perhaps , and now and then brandy . When they got it they made full use of it as is proved by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk , I am tipsy , I am given to drink " ? one could expect no more from a civilized man . Rale was Maine 's first prohibitionist , and more than once he protested to the English against their selling liquor to the Indians , but without effect , for a chief would barter a thousand acres for a bottle of rum . Their dress consisted of a robe , a skin , or blanket about the shoulders or waist , a French cloak , a close coat , shirt ,  |p777  underclothes , breeches , socks , and moccasins . Among the smaller items were the cap , hood , garter , girdle , scarf , mittens , muff , and handkerchief . But beyond the robe or blanket and the moccasins the Indians had only the names for these comforts . Their ornaments were feathers , beads , shells , or porcupine quills , with metal rings , bracelets , or earrings . Their garments were made of cotton or wool from the Europeans , or from the skins of fur-bearing animals . An important item was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacture and the names of their parts . Amongst the furnishings was the cradle , a section of board with a pocket of fur , to be carried on the back of the squaw . Mats were made of rushes or skins to cover the floor , or hung at the doorway . A bench , a basket , a broom , and a box were within their powers , and other items were obtained rarely by barter with the Europeans . For the kitchen they made plates , pitchers , and funnels of bark . From the outer world came metal kettles , frying-pans , bakeovens , gridirons , and spoons , but these must have been very uncommon . Amongst their personal belongings were a pipe , tobacco-bag , comb , tooth-pick , and ear-pick , and to both of these latter words the author adds , " I use it . " Lint they had and needed . A flute also was theirs , and they needed it not at all . The supply department contained candles , and these Hale made from the fruit of the bayberry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For cooking they used charcoal , but more commonly wood . They had what they called matches , but these were but slivers of wood with the ends dipped in sulphur . They lived in wigwams , conical in shape , or rounded at the top , or long and narrow , " like an asses back , " says Rale . These shelters were covered with bark or skins , and at the entrance a plank or stone was placed at which one desiring to enter might knock . About the cabin a trench was sometimes dug to prevent an inflow of water . There is a sug-  |p778  gestion of a door and of a key , but no hint of a lock . After this shelter was provided , or even before , the Indian 's most pressing need was a canoe , and Rale gives full accounts of the making , loading , and navigating of this street-car of the wilderness , together with the disasters that befell them . The repairs seem to have been very much the same as those incident to the management of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were able to get now and then an axe , hammer , adz , saw , file , or gimlet . A mallet and a whetstone they could provide themselves , and also make the snowshovel essential in winter . One word served for a hoe or spade , and possibly they did not have both . The bow , arrows , and quiver were their ancient weapons of the chase , and they also trained their dogs to aid , while traps were skilfully made and laid . In fishing they used hook and line , spear , net , and weir . In war they had the gun with its powderhorn and bullets , and also the sword , the drum , and the trumpet . The Indians were acquainted with the domestic animals of the Europeans , but apparently made little if any use of them in Maine . Rale gives long lists of the wild animals , birds , fishes , trees , and fruits , but in many cases identification is difficult or impossible from his meagre descriptions . Either the Indians had but one word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both . A curious addition to his list is the monkey , though how the Indians could have seen the animal often enough to give it a name is hard to conjecture , as the organ-grinder was not a feature of aboriginal life . The common deer , or cerf , and the moose are easily identified in the dictionary . There being but one other member of the family in Maine , the caribou , it must be what Rale calls the " chevreuil , " and the Indians name " norka . " One might easily be puzzled by the phrase , " Le gite de l'original , " for which the Indian equivalent was " m8s aka8di . " In the dictionary " gite " means home , lodging , seat , or form of hares , nether millstone , deposit , or bed . Here 's a  |p779  choice of evils that do not help , and it is only when one realizes that Rale always calls the moose " the original " that one is able to guess that the phrase means a moose yard in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken from the English , their standard of value was the beaverskin . This was the usual stake in gambling , and one offered a beaver-skin for the hire of a gun . The Indians divided the year into moons , and January was " when it is very cold " ; April , " when one takes a great quantity of herring " ; May , when one plants the Indian corn , " while August is " the long days . " The Indians were superstitious , and it is noted that " the fox prognosticates some evil . " When one kills nothing , but yet wounds the beast , it is a sign that someone is going to die , while the sight of a horrible bear has the same significance . The Indians had a word that meant the left hind foot of the moose . It may have had the same virtue that is supposed to be possessed by the rabbit in African myth . As might be expected Rale is not strong in natural history , but he does fairly well when he acknowledges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Doubtless he records popular belief when he notes , " The red mark which appears on the body of the child , the mother having eaten some fruits and being enceinte . " Was he anticipating bacteriology when he wrote , " I have bad teeth because of the worms which gnaw them . " " The bone which is in the middle of the heart of the moose , " he could not have invented , but got from the Indians . They also must have supplied the notion that " the fish leaps above to take the air , coming out of the water . " But can it be possible that " ekedaw " means all that ? As might be supposed , Father Hale is at times charmingly familiar . Thus he says , " Wipe the child 's nose which is norveux . " You see , when a passage becomes too familiar we have to drop into French , or another less known tongue . If I were able to translate other lines into passable Greek , I could record some things still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mankind through the centuries , in the cities , or in the back-woods . The Indians of Maine inhaled their smoke , had a toast-master at their feasts , and Rale says , " I do not know what taste that is . I have a cold . " " I go to war to have land , house , and money , " said the Indian then , and the Fatherland says the same thing now . " The girl adorns herself to please , " and , " I try to please a girl who adorns herself . " And this , mind you , is up the Kennebec , not on Broadway . " I make a catechism for children . Why do you not come there ? " Can not one sympathize with both ? " I go to bed having the thought that I shall get up soon to pray , and I sleep all the same , " will sound familiar to some . " Believing to kill a moose I kill a man " ; the humor of this will be appreciated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I owe much , " said the young buck , and the creditor replied , " It is in vain that thou hast said to me , I will pay thee , ' since thou dost not do it "  - -  - the conversation could not be carried on more aptly to-day . " I look for a quarrel without cause , " and it is instructive to learn that this was known as " une querelle d ' Allemand . " " I bring up a child with much difficulty , " sighs the Indian , and " I put that in one place thinking to put it in another , " and these things happen yet . By this time the reader will begin to suspect that Father Rale is a bit of a philosopher , writing for all time . Here are some nuggets well worth while . " Of two knives ; give him one , that which remains breaks , that is why I regret the gift . " Can we not all enjoy so common a grief ? " I rush towards him to beat him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change our minds on occasion . " I move him to anger by telling him not to get angry , " and this also never fails us . " One values that which is rare , and scorns that which is common . " " I anger him by speech , " and this is followed by , " I speak all the same . " " I make him go out by the fear I cause him ; that is why he goes . " " I was willing to cry , to be sorry , but I stop as my tears serve not . " " He  |p781  is wise , visits not at all , jests not at all , works always . " Surely this is an entrancing tongue if all that wisdom is concentrated in " wannesou . " Even more delightful is , " I became all of a sudden wise , having been a fool for a long time . " Most of us will subscribe to the first part of this sentiment , and our wives will remind us of the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horns , that is mockery , " is an odd phrase to come from an American Indian . " It is dangerous , takes courage , to say mass because the particles of the host are carried away by the least wind , " shows that the father had troubles of his own . In referring pathetically to the louse he says , " I have some , I touch it , " and then triumphantly , " I crush it . " Unfortunately it will be noted that the possession is plural and the accomplishment only singular . " I fan myself , " he gives , and then adds , " item , I drive away the mosquitoes . " In another place he tells us that " the mosquitoes pass through the crepe , " which proves that their cleverness is of long standing . It is curious to note that nowhere does he refer to the ravages of the black-fly or the midge . The European brought to the Indians numerous objects for which they had no name . Usually they adopted the English or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these words Father Rale spelled as best he could . " Those are cows , " an Englishman might say , and the beef on the table was the same ; so the aborigine adopted that name for beef , and Rale spelled it " kaws . " For cabbage they had " kabbits , " for cat , or pussy , " pesouis , " for wheat , or English corn , " igris karnar , " for Englishman , " igrismann , " for hammer , " amare , " for iron , " aren . " Kettle , from cook , was " koukou , " money was " manni , " pin was " pinss , " while pigs , pork , or ham were all alike " pikess , " and sugar was " sougar . " From the French they borrowed " ange , " angel , making it " angeri , " likewise " commune " was the same , " confesse " also was " confesse , " " hostie , " the host , was " hostiouin , " " messe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saint was " sannte . " From all of this it is clear that the Indians got food and tools from the English and religion from the French . Many Indian words have been adopted into the English language , and among them we find , sagamite , samp , hominy , moccasin , moose , mushquash , skunk , wigwam , and tomahawk . Rale also uses certain Indian words as if they were French , as " babiche , " a strap , " penak , " potatoes , " ouragan , " a dish made of bark , and " petun , " as tobacco was called in the North . When the Indians gave names to places , they described the physical characteristics , and never called them after their chiefs or early settlers , avoiding an atrocity so common with civilized peoples . The Abenaki for long is " kenne , " " tonne , " " quenne , " " quinne , " or " quonne , " and we have an equal variety of spelling in other roots . Sometimes the Indian would drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ euphony , and frequently the recorder helped confusion by misspelling . This is clear when a place name in New England is given an 1 , for there is no such sound in the tongue of our northern Indians , r being usually substituted . Androscoggin has been spelled in fifty different ways , and the only thing we are now sure of is that the accepted way is wrong , as the first syllables were changed in compliment to Governor Andros . He might better have taken his sullied name with him when he left . The river may have got its name from Skowhegan , fish-spearing place . Rale spells it Anmesoukkantti , and if this is correct it would mean " where fish are plenty . " Chenebesic , great water place , was the Indian name of Moosehead Lake . Cohasset means pine place . Connecticut , " conne-attuck-ut , " is long deer place . Housatonic is from " hussan-otanic , " stony village . Kennebec , which Rale spells " Kinibeki , " Kennebago , Kennebunk , Kennebacook , and Quinnipiac , the Indian name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long waters , for it is to be remembered that the terminals , or  |p783  locatives , vary much . Rale spells Massachusetts , " Messatsousek " ; it is from " massa-wadchu-s-et , " or much mountains . Merrimac is from " merru-m-ac , " swift place . Mississippi is " missi-sipi " ( sipou ) , or much river . Narragansett is smooth expanse . Oquossoc. the ancient name of Rangeley Lake , is from " qwesous-oc , " a place where there are bears , and tradition asserts that the region was once noted for the number of its bears . Penobscot is from " penopscot , " rocky place . Sunapee is from " sehonk-nepe , " or goose place , while Suncook has the same derivation and meaning . Tamaqua , the Pennsylvania town , means beaver , and Rale spells it " temack8e . " Umbagog is probably " wampi-gog , " or clear place . Welokennebacook is from " winne-kenne-nebi-cook , " beautiful long waters . " Sis " means little , and " sissis " would be very little . " Gom " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while " Gomsissis " is very little lake . " Sisgomsis " would be a lake small at both ends . " K'tche , " " che , " or " pis " means great , so we have " K'tchegomic , " great lake ; and this was the Indian name of Superior . What a life Father Rale led for half his years ! Feeding only upon pounded corn which he made into a gruel himself . Far from home , from friends , from kindred , alone in a wilderness , amongst savages , with the Iroquois dreaded , dreamed of , and the Puritan ever threatening . And at the last , when sixty-seven years of age , he falls bleeding , dead , before the ruins of his church . Well might his epitaph be : " Nesi8kandam i8darikik " ? I am disgusted with being on the earth .
