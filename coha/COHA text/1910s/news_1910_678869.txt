txt None of the bills regAutomobiles ulating the use of autoShould mobiles that are now Not Smoke , before the Legislature contain even a reference , we think . to one phase of the subsect that certainly deserves attention and action . New York is approaching , not very slowly , now , the highly desirable condition of being a horseless city , but as the number of self-propelled vehicles increases Ube evil of smoke emission from these machines is becoming steadily more serious , and , unless stopped in time , this new form of the old " smoke nuisance ? ? will make us regret the passing of the horse , dangerous and troublesome beast as he is from the standpoints of cleanliness and hygiene . Just how much of a menace to health the frequent breathing of the vapors from explosive engines may be is yet to be determined , but already the doctors are ascribing to this cause various irritations of the throat and lungs . Certainly these emanations are obnoxious to one of the senses , and . without doubt they are wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ruinous to the more delicate kinds of clothing upon which it is deposited . Fortunately the efficiency of the automobile , whether the magnificent limousine , the modest roadster , or the humble truck , does not depend on thb production of visible fumes . On the contrary , they are a , sign on the one hand of wasted fuel and lubricant . and , on the other , of carelessness or incompetency on the part of the chauffeur . With a rigid anti-smoke ordinance sternly enforced , applying not to the parks alone , but to the whole city , the smoke evil would promptly come to an end , without interfering in the slightest degree with the proper privileges and utilities of motor cars . When they are skillfully handled , the products of combustion in their cylinders all escape in the form of invisible gases . The smoking automobile ought to be stopped by the police wherever seen , and not allowed to go on until the Condition has been remedied . ' That would be more effective than any system of fines or banishment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What amounts to that measure of prevention has been adopted in both London and Paris , and it has proved entirely effective . After it had been enforced for a. few weeks every chauffeur , ' amateur and professional , would have acquired the easy art of using oil instead of burning it , and we would all be , if not happy , at least a little happier than we are at present . That a victim as emBlackmailers anent as CARUSO should Caught have been selected for for Once . exploitation by Black Hand bandits speaks more for the audacity of these villains than for their judgment . But It also says much as to the probable frequency with which their threats are effective , for only a long period of success with immunity could have emboldened the Black Handers to make so large a demand from a man who , as they should have known , both would and could command specially energetic action from the police for his protection . When one remembers hod often the blackmailers escape arrest after using bombs or the dagger to punish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which the detectives hunted down the hawks who ventured to fly at this high game is calculated to inspire in suspicious minds a feeling that what was done once could be done always if police interest in an east side grocer was as keen as in a world-famous tenor . As a matter of fact , however , in not a few cases when the east side grocer has given the police a chance to act , they have captured his enemies , just as they did CARUSO 'S , and the failures were presumably clue to ill-luck rather than to lack of zeal . The Caruso episode is important chiefly because the eminence of the selected victim for extortion will fix public attention on the boldness and activity of the Black Hand gangs , and lead to a realization of the truth that if effective measures are not taken for their suppression their attacks will not long be confined to the social stratum where their outrages have hitherto been committed . It is the consensus of expert opinion that this form of crime must be met by police agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . We hate the very . idea of a force of secret spies , and have been ' justifiably reluctant to establish one , but if blackmail based on threats of assassination  --  and on threats that are carried out if not heeded  --  can be ended in no other way , that way must apparently be adopted sooner or later . That being so , sooner would seem to be preferable . to later . As experience has proved , the receipt of a Black Hand warning is not a joke , and while the best thing to do with it is to turn it over instantly to the ? police , with all the information available , safety by no means always follows the taking of that course . To be sure , if has often been said ' that there is no such thing as the Bliteli Hand , but there certainly is a something that kills when money is refused , and those who receive its letters have good reason for fear .

Our own opinion inclines strongly against the defendant and toward the prosecution In this far from unimportant case . Boys undoubtedly can stand and really need a lot of muscular exertion , but it should be of the kind to which they naturally resort as a part of normal play . Training for , and the performance of , special gymnastic feats , particularly under the spur of hot rivalry for prizes or honors , can not be called play , and the sort of development that results from it is to be viewed with suspicion always and with fear often . - It is better for a boy to be well than to be notably strong  --  better for him to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them more efficient than those of other boys of his age .
