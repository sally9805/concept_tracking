txt " German troops land in Finland . " Of course they do . Did Finland imagine she would be allowed to keep that independence she has been asserting ? She lies above the Gulf of Finland , Petrograd below it . Germany intends to have Petrograd . Would it be at all workmanlike to take the lower jaw and leave the upper ? She must have both sides of that gulf . This is a ease where Germany can not attain her ends by waving the " self-determination of peoples " in the air , for the Bolshevik admit the independence of Finland . So she does not wave it ; she proceeds with an ostrichlike caution ; all she wants to do is to help the Finns restore order . For that purpose the backbone of her first expedition is composed of Finnish soldiers who have served in the German Army . They go there to restore order under German auspices and make plain to their home-staying brethren the altruism of Germany 's intentions . The second expedition  --  that will be another story . Finland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Courland . Poland , Lithuania  --  yes , and the Ukraine , for the independence of the Ukraine is merely a fiction to be kept up as lope ; as Germany permits . The sweep of the German arms is vast , and their aim is no longer in arrttit . It is to take , not this country and that , not a bite here and a bite there , but every inch of what used to , be Russia that can be taken and stowed away before the Spring weather makes it necessary to concentrate on the west . The immense opportunity opened by the fall of Russia is evidently what has caused the postponement or entire abandonment of the advertised drive in France , and it is as likely as not that if there is any drive it will not be a German one . Germany is in the position of a bandit who , preparing to enter on an arduous and doubtful ' combat with an armed traveler for the possession of his wallet , suddenly sees another traveler drop a bushel basket crammed with treasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grabs she makes simultaneously in all directions , are easily accounted for . She must seize all the Russian plunder before Spring and the rea.wakehing of the west . Any excuse is good enough to hang a dog . She will assure selfdetermination to Courland , drive the " Bolshevist border hordes " away from , Lithuania , suppress anarchy in Finland  --  any pretense that comes handy will do ; the one thing needful is to get all these countries harvested and in the barn before ' the shower , And then what ? Will she , with a fine gesture , offer to make peace and withdraw her troops from France and Belgium if the Allies will let her keep the loot she has taken from their false friend Russia ? Or , drunk with conquest and mad with ? self-confidence , will she undertake to keep the east and win the west as well ? One alternative is about as objectionable as the other , but one of the two is surely what she has in store for ' us ; and we can only wait , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishonorable compromise or more desperate war , our answer is Pgraires . Whichever way she tries to go , she shall not Pass .
