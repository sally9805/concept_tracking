 |p613  EXTRAVAGANCE is the paramount American characteristic , not only individually but Nationally . It is the natural outgrowth of the conditions which have made America a leader in the world 's affairs . We have enjoyed exceptional advantages . Opportunity , fettered and hedged about by conditions and conventions in other countries , has been free and open to all here . our natural resources were rich beyond compare . Our enterprise and genius have combined to exploit them with astonishing results . Remarkable prosperity has attended our National growth . Many new fields of endeavor and profit have been created . Tremendone fortunes have been won , fortunes which frequently have increased by millions over night . And where money comes easily it encourages lavish expenditure . So we have come to be regarded by the world at large as a Nation of spendthrifts . Wastefulness is looming more and more as the eventual National curse . Accustomed always to plenty , we have yet to learn the lesson of imperative frugality . There is a bottom to every purse ; a danger line for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granting of special privilege . And yet the exercise of economy in public expenditures , the conservation of our natural resources , the breaking of the chains of special privilege for the protection of the inalienable rights of the people , their industries and commerce , from the greedy clutch of vandal hands , make no lasting appeal to the public mind . Our National motto , to all intents and purposes , might be , " Eat , drink , and be merry . " What is the result ? THE COLLECTORS OF TOLL Government expenditures , according to the declarations of officials long prominent in National affairs , average approximately a million dollars a day more than they should be . Our timber supply , which once overflowed into the markets of Europe , is fast approaching exhaustion , and lumber prices have more than doubled in the last decade . Our coal lands , mined with a total loss of probably one-third of their deposits , are in the hands of a few men of great wealth and the railways , to whom annually we pay excessive prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more in the years to come . Our mineral deposits are controlled by the most gigantic combinations the world has ever known , likewise eager to get rich quickly . Our phosphate deposits are trustowned . Our water power sites are being gobbled as rapidly as may be by kindred interests . The railways combine in extortionate rate-making . The telephones and telegraphs have been consolidated in all but name . In every city the public utility franchises are in predatory hands , and the movement toward Nation-wide consolidation of these interests is being rapidly extended . At every hand we are confronted by the same intolerable conditions ? arbitrary control , arbitrary fixing of prices and rates , arbitrary levying of toll upon the public , which must have the service and necessarily must pay for it , whatever the interests in control may dictate . Old World nations of greater age and experience are solving these problems by the direct method of government ownership . The United States must inevitably learn this lesson . The people have yet to awaken to the growing menace of the times ; to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual and National welfare ; to the blight which the oppressions of the railway and financial barons put upon industry and commerce ; to the fact that it is this  |p614  free and untrammeled license given the special interests to practice extortion upon the whole people that is pushing the cost of living higher and higher , making the rich richer and the poor more and more needy . WHY THE PEOPLE PAY TOLL But more dangerous than all of these to the National future is the sinister influence which is creeping insidiously and persistently into our official life ? the defiant indifference with which trust is betrayed , pledges forgotten , and the rights and interests of the people bartered away for personal advantage ; in a word , the criminal hypocrisy and treason of the men who make , interpret , and administer our laws more and more to the benefit of the financially powerful and correspondingly to the detriment of the man who really earns his bread by the sweat of his brow . In the sessions of the Sixtieth , Sixty-first , and Sixty-second Congress approximately seventy-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BE DONE We need sorely the awakening of a sincere , aggressive , uplifting National consciousness . These sporadic uprisings of an outraged people such as recently worked the repudiation of the Taft Administration are insufficient . As a rule , the people as a whole are prone to quit with the job half finished . They are too quick to return to the political gods of their fathers and fresh humiliation . The old parties have been gangrenous with political corruption . They have sold our birthright times without number for a mess of pottage . Dishonesty , trickery , false pretense , and betrayal have flourished overlong in our so-called statesman ship . The preservation of our Government will come only through the persistent and concerted action of a party with far-seeing business sense and a highly developed patriotism which will stand for the conservation of all privileges , rights , and natural resources which make for the future welfare of the Nation and its people . Each step toward that end will be met by the determined opposition of the interests which have preyed for years upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years to come . This has been demonstrated already in the Government 's tardily adopted policy of reserving certain forest and mineral lands . The protests occasioned by this action will be as an evening zephyr is to JTLOOK 19 July a Kansas cyclone in comparison with the storm that will break when Uncle Sam seeks to take over the railways , the telegraphs , the water power stations , the coal lands , the phosphate deposits , and to enact such other restrictive legislation as may seem imperative for the common good . All this must eventually come . The ninetyodd millions of people , of whom , for whom , and by whom the Government is perpetuated , will sooner or later come to a realization of the necessity for drastic action in self-defense . The natural resources and certain public service corporations peculiarly allied therewith must come under Government control . In many cities the seeds of this movement are being sown . Municipal light , water , gas , street railway , and various other companies are being operated with profit to the public . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that public ownership is wholly practical and immensely advantageous . Unconsciously , perhaps , they are making conservation in its largest sense inevitable . THE ALL-PERVADING Railway Just as inevitably , successful conservation all centers about the railways . They are the trunk of the tree . From them emerge as branches all these others the telegraphs , the water power sites , the coal , mineral , phosphate , and timber lands necessary in the general conservation scheme . With the railways as the hub , these others become the spokes in the great wheel of the future National prosperity . Intersecting the country in a great web from ocean to ocean and from the Lakes to the Gulf , penetrating every section where the industry of man has established itself successfully , are the thousands of miles of railway right of way . This right of way ordinarily embraces a strip of land one hundred feet in width . Seldom is more than half of it in actual use for trackage . The rest is unproductive of profit , and unused save for drainage purposes . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under a scientific governmental conservation plan this unused right of way would be made to accommodate the conduits of the Federal Telegraph System . It would carry the mains of the Federal Fuel Gas Company , which would manufacture its product in the coal fields and pipe it directly to the consumer in the villages and cities within reach  |p615  at a fraction of the present city rates . It would make it possible for the Federal Electric Company to lay a system of forever safe underground cables for the transmission of electricity from the water power stations to the cities , the manufacturing centers , the thousand and one villages within reach of its central power-houses , likewise at fifty per cent less than existing lighting and power rates . Meantime the railways would be carrying freight and express packages at a little more than half the present rates . The saving on the mail contracts would permit of a real parcels post . And Uncle Sam could supply the farmer with phosphates and lime necessary for fertilizing his lands and increasing their output at a price which he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By no means . The dream of a theorist ? Not at all . Simply a business proposition thoroughly practical and certain to be adopted once the lagging thought of the times catches up with the procession of its needs and injustices . Other Governments control the railways and telegraphs . Why not ours ? President Taft recently recommended to Congress the building of a Government-owned railway in Alaska . More recently , Postmaster-General Hitchcock advocated Government ownership of the telegraphs . The Province of Ontario , Canada , is furnishing electricity to its various municipalities , carrying it from one hundred to two hundred miles by cable at less than half the rate exacted formerly by privateowned companies . Natural gas companies pipe their product equally as far , and expect , when the supply is exhausted , to furnish through these same mains artificial gas manufactured in the coal fields adjacent to the gas belts . The German Government controls the potash beds in Saxony , from which are shipped annually to the United States more than 125,000 tons , the bulk of which goes to enrich the impoverished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Sam is operating a coal mine and electric power plant in connection with the Williston-BufordTrenton ( North Dakota ) irrigation project , and producing coal which could be sold at $1.60 a ton as against $2.50 asked by the privateowned mines in the same territory . Why should n't Uncle Sam do all of these things and save thousands of lives and millions of dollars for the people annually LIVES WORTH SAVING For it is n't a matter of dollars alone . The private-owned corporation is as reckless with the people 's lives as it is with their money . This question of human life enters tremendously into the problem of ownership . To realize just how tremendously , give attention to the figures which follow , the most recent I find readily available for international comparison . In the United States in 1909 , of 891,472 , - 425 passengers carried by the railways , 253 were killed and 10,311 injured . Foreign roads showed : France , 491,936,930 carried , 8 killed , 283 injured ; Great Britain , 1,265 , - 080,761 carried , 94 killed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 567 injured ; Belgium , 193,069,662 carried , 11 killed and 359 injured . Reduce these showings to the basis of relative danger and you will find that a passenger 's chances of being killed are eighteen times greater aboard an American train than aboard one in France , while his danger of injury is forty times greater . Corresponding comparisons with the other nations show the American danger to be greater in these ratios Great Britain , death , four to one ; injury , three to one . Germany , death , four to one injury , twenty to one . Belgium , death , five to one ; injury , thirty to one . And do n't overlook the fact that the least danger is with the Government-owned roads . With us the situation is growing worse every year . In 1912 the railway death toll in passengers was 318 . The injured numbered 16,386 . One employee ( trainman ) in every six was killed or injured , the figures showing : killed , 3,235 ; injured , 50,079 . In these same countries for the five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each 1,000 miners employed there were killed as follows : United States , 3.39 ; France , 0.91 ; Great Britain , 1.28 ; Prussia , 2.06 ; and Belgium , 1 . So for each man killed in a European mine three or four were killed in the United States . But there has never been a fatality in Uncle Sam 's model mine at Williston , North Dakota . Bureau of Labor statistics show that for twenty years the average annual death rate from accidents in coal mines has been in excess of three persons for each 1,000 employed . Six men are killed for each million tons of coal mined . On this basis it may reasonably be expected that of the more than  |p616  700,000 miners employed in the United States at least 2,500 will meet accidental death within a year . Talk about widows and orphans ! Ten thousand railway sacrifices ! Twenty-five hundred coal mine victims ? Fifty thousand widows and orphans annually as the result of criminal disregard of the rights of employee and public ' Although it has been demonstrated that the greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been the fault of the miner himself , it still remains that more strict regulations in operating and mining should be established under Government control . For the railway managers have flagrantly ignored the laws requiring the adoption of safeguards in equipment . In their desire to maintain dividend rates on copiously watered stocks they have permitted both roadbeds and rolling stock to deteriorate . Meantime in the coal fields the recommendations of the United States Bureau of Mines for the installation of improved safety appliances and apparatus have commanded scant recognition . With Government ownership such appalling conditions would not be suffered . Public protest would speedily compel remedial action . HARD DOLLARS ALSO WORTH SAVING But as human life is cheap in this enlightened age , and good , hard dollars are all-powerful , let us consider the purely economical side of the problem . First , the invisible burden of the railway , express , and telegraph companies , which for several years has hovered around $168 a family . The railway toll alone is close to S150 a family . And the workingman. he of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and whose average annual earning the Bureau of Labor fixes at $450. pays this toll unconsciously in the increased prices of everything he buys . Of course not every individual family is hit as hard as this . If they were , this Government would not last over night . Some families pay a great deal more than others . They buy more . But if the railway toll were arbitrarily assessed pro rata , it would mean $150 annually to each head of a family . There is but one reason for this : Half the railway capitalization of nineteen billion dollars is water . Interest payments must be made upon every dollar 's worth of watered bonds . Dividends are expected on every dollar of watered stock . And we must pay both interest and dividends in transportation bills . Last year this meant $352,858,616 in interest and $283,008,634 in dividends . Railway transportation bills aggregated $2,608,000,364 , at the rate of $7,145,179 a day . The situation is no better with the express and telegraph companies . Neither represent any initial investment to speak of . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public pocket . Both capitalizations , aggregating some $300,000,000 , are watered . In a recent report the Inter-State Commerce Commission said that the express companies which began " sixty years ago with no assets whatsoever other than favorable contracts with one or more railroads " have accumulated properties worth $150,000,000 and paid dividends meanwhile exceeding a quarter billion dollars . The first telegraph line was bui ' t with Government aid . Early development was with meager investment . Eventually the business paid handsomely . Now , with capitalizations exceeding $200.000,000 , the companies pay big dividends . Last year the Western Union alone had a surplus of more than ten millions . All three systems make the public pay the highest possible rates . With the express and telegraph companies double rates have been the rule where two companies participate in the transmission . The railway policy is , " All the traffic will bear . " Yet stress is laid by the railways upon their fairness to the public and their unfailing respect for the laws . We who are shippers know differently , and you who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They tell a striking story . In 1911 , of sixty-two indictments for criminal violation of the act to regulate commerce twenty-nine were against railways , the rest against shippers who conspired with the roads . The Government must have a holeproof case before it can convict a railway , yet in forty-two prosecutions twenty-nine convictions were secured and fines assessed aggregating $214,000 . So much for their respect for the law . THE FELLOW WHO PAYS THE BILL Now the shipper 's side . During the year there were filed with the Commission 881 formal complaints , 4,325 informal complaints , 5,653 claims for overcharge , and 5,723 appli/ cations for relief from the operation of the long and short haul rule . Which would indicate that the railways are making hay while the sun shines . This tells only a small part of the story . The big injustice is done the small shipper , the fellow who pays the freight bill rather than engage the railway in a controversy which means annoyance , waste of time , and expense which he can ill afford . Annually there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railway practice of overcharging is so persistent and well recognized that in nearly every large city are mercantile traffic agencies which do a flourishing business in collecting for shippers claims for errors in rates and classifications developed from their auditing the shipper 's freight bills . Usually this is done on the basis of fifty per cent of what is recovered . Of course not all of the more than 16,000 claims and complaints filed with the Commission last year were disposed of . The Commission can handle only a certain amount of business . There are only seven members . Were it possible for them to handle , in their capacity as judges , all the legitimate claims that might be filed with them against the railways in the course of a year , they would dispose of half as much business as all the courts of the country combined . A complaint filed to-day may be disposed of next year or the year after . Meantime complaints and claims are piling up day by day . So what is the use ? Conditions alone protect the railways , give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the roads this situation will continue . This rate injustice has long been widespread and notorious . It is local to no section . Such improvement as has been forced came slowly . In a hundred years the Cornmission may finish the job . I have in mind an instance where an investor owns a large interest in a coal mine in eastern Ohio , and a manufacturing plant one hundred miles or so away . Yet he can not supply his manufactory from his own mine in his own State , but must buy West Virginia coal , which though shipped twice or thrice the distance still is cheaper because of freight concessions the railways make to West Virginia operators . SHOULD FREIGHT RATES BE INCREASED ? The one thing most imminent is a renewed demand on the part of the railways for an increase in freight rates , the privilege to make heavier the annual family burden . A daily toll of more than $7,000,000 is not enough . And , keeping step in the march of public pillage , the express companies , credited by the Inter-State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets in fifty years without any actual investment , have protested to the Commission that the enforcement of the recent rate readjustment order would mean to them a loss of $74,446 a day . Recent newspaper and magazine articles from the pens of railway presidents all declare the railway earning power must be increased . Why ? Bonds do not sell as easily as they did formerly . Of an authorized issue of approximately three billions , they were able to dispose of only about one billion last year . Mr. James J. Hill , who speaks with authority for the railways , fixes the amount of money for which they have imperative and immediate need at nine billion dollars . And what is this stupendous amount of money needed for ? Terminals chiefly , says Mr. Hill , who compares existing railway terminal facilities to the small neck of a large bottle . Inadequate terminals retard the movement of trains , congest traffic , and thereby cripple the industrial and commercial interests of the country . Incidentally , Mr. Hill would add some up-to-date rolling stock and re-ballast some badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invested in terminals is charged against capital and goes into bonded indebtedness ; into sure , interest-earning , permanent investment . And safe , permanent investment is desirable above all else . Interest must be paid , but dividends may be passed . And the greater the capitalization the more staggering the burden Uncle Sam must assume once he takes over the lines . That is one way of frightening off Government ownership . Yet , remembering that during the last ten years the railways have collected approximately twenty billion dollars in transportation charges , paid nearly three billions in dividends and had left nearly four billions of surplus , one wonders how this woeful railway condition came about . Surely it can not be that the railway barons , believing Government ownership to be inevitable , even imminent , have deliberately permitted their systems to become worn-out , bankrupt , so to speak , and short of terminals 618 with the intention of unloading them upon Uncle Sam in that deplorable condition at a capitalization of more than twenty billions , one-half of which is water ? SAVING A MILLION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies are peculiarly and inevitably allied . Uncle Sam should take them over simultaneously , combine with them the mail service , and operate them all under one department with four subdivisions . More than a million dollars a day could be saved by this joint operation . In the cities the telegraph office could be in the post-office . Telegraph stamps could be sold the same as postage stamps . In the small towns telegraph offices could be maintained at railway stations . The express service could co-operate with the parcels post . Economies could be effected in the railway mail service . It is logical , practical , businesslike . More , it is inevitable . WHERE THE RAILWAYS COULD SAVE THEIR WASTE Now , what of the coal lands and water power sites ? From the view-point of conservation they are unalterably linked . For , as a producer of horse-power , coal must eventually give way to water . As a fuel it will first be converted into gas . Present returns from the use of raw coal are too small . A recent report of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over eleven per cent of the energy in coal is effectively utilized . The remainder of the energy is lost through the inefficiency of the steam boiler , the steam engine , and the electric dynamo . " It was undoubtedly this realization which led President Ripley , of the Atchison , Topeka , and Santa Fe system , recently to predict the electrification of all the railways within another quarter-century . Boiler scale in locomotives alone represents a loss of 15,000,000 tons of coal annually . And locomotives use only onefifth of the annual output . Estimate for yourself the stupendous waste from this cause , supplemented by unscientific stoking , in the many thousands of manufacturing plants throughout the country . Nor is that all . Experts of the United States Bureau of Mines estimate that $40 , - 000,000 is lost annually in unscientific coke production . It is no longer questioned that the loss from the smoke nuisance in cities is tremendous . In Cleveland this loss is estimated at $6,000,000 annually . In Chicago it probably more nearly approximates $50 , - 000,000 . Moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public health is incalculably detrimental . Finally , according to the Bureau of Mines , in mining the annual output of five hundred million tons " probably one-third of the bituminous coal and one-half of the anthracite are left in the mine " under conditions which practically preclude their ever being taken out later . The adoption of scientific mining methods at . a moderate increase in expense would greatly reduce this excessive waste . ABOUT TIME TO CALL A HALT But , worse yet , at our present rate of production we have anthracite coal for only fifty years and bituminous coal for one hundred years ! About time to call a halt , is n't it ? Gas-making experiments which the Government experts have been pursuing for a dozen years or more prove that coal may be converted into gas with a material increase in the horse-power attained from the later use of this gas for fuel purposes . In addition a tremendous saving can be made in the byproducts which are utterly lost when the coal is fed directly into the furnaces . Primarily these are coke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something like fifty other products may be obtained . And by the use of gas the propertydamaging , plant-devastating , health-destroying smoke nuisance would be eliminated . AVAILABLE MAGIC Not long ago Henry S. Graves , United States Forester , estimated the undeveloped water power of the National forest reserves at twelve million horse-power , which is but a fraction of the available water power in the country . If this water power could be developed and converted into electrical horsepower , under proper Federal supervision and regulation , it would operate every bit of machinery in the land at approximately one-half the present outlay for motive power . The industrial effect would be magical . Electricity will be the power of the future . And the part which water power is to play in generating electrical current has by no means been overlooked by the special interests which would have the Nation 's industries at their mercy in another half-century were they permitted to form a water power trust .  |p619  The possibilities are notably demonstrated at Niagara Falls and at Keokuk , Iowa . At the latter point the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will have a daily capacity of 200,000 horse-power . This electricity will be distributed by cable over a tremendous area for lighting and power purposes . These water power grabbers are not sleeping on their opportunities . Before Congress last session were bills which sought to give away , without compensation to the Government or protection for the people , water power sites in half a dozen States worth $50,000 , - 000 . Protesting against their passage , Congressman Benjamin G. Humphreys , of Mississippi , declared : " We will have a Water Power Trust in comparison with which the Steel Trust and the Standard Oil Trust will seem as mere benevolent societies organized for the dissemination of Christian charity . " And Senator Burton , speaking before the Senate , said : The possibility of a control of the business of the country through the agency of water power is more imminent than any form of control ever attempted in the history of human endeavor . " Do n't you think it is nearly time for Uncle Sam to take hold of this water power site problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then there is the timber supply , and the leaping lumber prices which are adding millions annually to the cost of construction . Half a dozen years ago , Weyerhaeuser , the Northwest lumber king , said : " I never made a mistake in buying lumber ? except when I did not buy . " Uncle Sam should paste that remark in his hat . The Weyerhaeuser millions attest its truth . Uncle Sam has in reserve about one-fifth of the 550,000,000 acres of timber land in this country . And that one-fifth is by no means the pick of it . The far-seeing Weyerhaeusers beat him in that . Of the rest , two railways and three lumber companies own one-fourth ; two hundred owners control another one-fourth ; and the remainder is scattered among thousands . Annually the timber consumption in the United States averages 260 cubic feet per capita as against 25 cubic feet in France and 37 in Germany . Last year the twenty billion cubic feet used was valued at about $1,250 , - 000,000 . The present rate of cutting is three times the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thirty-five years if this rate is maintained . Strangely enough , the need of careful reforesting has impressed few outside the National forestry service and the State experimental work . In all about one million acres have been replanted to forest , and the great bulk of it has been by farmers of the Middle West for the purpose of sheltering their fields and buildings from the winds . In Europe reforesting is practiced universally , Italy , France , and particularly Germany leading in the work . WHILE UNCLE SAM IS ASLEEP The truth is , the country does not realize the situation with regard to any of our natural resources . These dangers which menace our general welfare seem strangely slow in soaking in . We are too madly engaged in chasing the nimble nickel to give them thought . But the chasing , by reason of this indifference , will be far more strenuous twenty years hence . Meantime , while the public ignores and Uncle Sam sleeps , the lumber barons are busy . They have gathered in the Oregon forests , where ten years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worth forty cents . Likewise the pine lands in northern California and the long-leaf yellow pine belts of the South . Eventually the people will pay the penalty . WHY THE FARMERS ' BOYS FLOCK TO THE CITIES Finally , let us consider the hand that feeds . To the farmer 's failure to maintain the maximum production of his land is attributed the high cost of living by that eminent student of economics , Mr. James J. Hill . Going further , he adds that unless there is a radical change in the prevailing methods of farming the year 1950 will see a shortage of 400,000,000 bushels in the wheat crop alone . Other crops will decrease proportionately , and the big problem will be how to feed the largely increased population . Unquestionably conditions on the farm are not the most promising . The farmer boys are flocking to the cities , and the city youths are not attracted by the " back to the land " movement . Now what is the trouble Simply that the land is wearing out and it is becoming , more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is particularly so in any section which has  |p620  been tilled for fifty years . Our farming has not been done scientifically . The average farmer is a farmer in name only . His methods have forced the unproductiveness of barren New England . They threaten the whole country . MONOPOLY HERE TOO The remedy ? Scientific soil feeding . For this are needed primarily four elements imperative to vigorous plant life : potash , phosphate , nitrate , and lime , particularly the first three named . Withhold either from the soil and plant life is doomed . Monopoly has placed its greedy hand upon the potash , phosphate , and nitrate . Prices are beyond the reach of the average farmer . German potash costs about $40 a ton ; Chilean nitrate , nearer $50 ; Tennessee and Florida phosphates , from $8 to $12 ; lime , $4 . In consequence fertilizing is skimped , crops go hungry , and the yield is disappointing . America is barren of nitrate deposits . Potash has been found in limited quantities in Wyoming and Utah , and but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposits in San Bernardino County , California , estimated to contain from four to ten million tons . And the fertilizer trust is hot after it . Phosphate deposits in South Carolina were exhausted several years ago . The quarries in Tennessee and Florida are estimated to have a life of twenty-five years at the present rate of production . Yet , despite this limited supply , phosphate made up the bulk of our more than ten million dollars ' worth of fertilizer exported the last year . Uncle Sam should stop this by peremptorily taking over these phosphate properties . Right here at home we have need of every ounce of phosphate , potash , and nitrate possible of production in this country . Recently the Government decided to expend $20,000,000 in reclaiming arid Western lands . What is the use of reclamation if the future farmers of this territory are to be at the mercy of the world 's fertilizer monopolies , or , worse yet , if the supplies here are to be exhausted shortly as sacrifices to the ruthless ambition of a few men to add immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the prices of farm products mounting constantly and the annual production failing to keep pace with the population increase , would n't you think Uncle Sam would give some decisive attention to these things ? THE FARMER AND THE BANKS There is one other thing the farmer needs . And right now he needs it more than all else . This is more credit ; some easier way of obtaining money necessary for immediate farm improvement . For without farm improvement as well as improved methods in farming there will be no early increase in farm production . The farmer is entitled to and should have an equality in credit ? in other words , an equality of collateral . Before the Pujo money trust investigating committee Mr. Morgan stated that he had loaned as much as a million dollars to a man who had no collateral security . Let us suppose the average farmer had mistakenly wandered into Wall Street that day . What would have been his chances ? The first question would have been , " What security can you furnish ? " The next statement probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't have got the money . The Census fixes the value of our farms at approximately $41,000,000,000 , and the mortgages thereon at $6,300,000,000 , which is an increase of eighteen per cent in ten years . President Taft said in his letter to the Governors that the farmer pays an average interest rate of eight and one-half per cent . There is little doubt that he pays a much higher rate than the average business man and experiences greater difficulty in negotiating a loan . Under existing Federal statutes National banks are not permitted to lend him money on his farm . If this prohibition is to stand , the Government should come to his rescue with some adequate system of farm loans . There are several ways of doing this . France has about 6,000 organizations in her system of co-operative loan societies , under which plan a score or more farmers bind themselves by agreement to make good collectively any loss which a bank may sustain from loaning to any member individually . Germany has more than 18,000 societies operating under the same plan , strengthened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them small loans for current needs prevail , yet these loans aggregate millions annually . New Zealand has a plan which eliminates the banks and all chance of Shylockism . Uncle Sam must adopt some such plan , a  |p621  plan that will forever free the farmer from the clutches of the money trust . The money provided for the farmer 's use must always be ready at his demand . Wall Street must not be allowed to have and . use it for stock gambling purposes . And , above all else , the interests which Wall Street represents must not be permitted through this agency to get their predatory grip upon the American farm , the one lone institution which they do not already either partly or wholly control . In New Zealand the Government sells its own bonds directly to the people and lends the proceeds to the farmers at four per cent , taking mortgages upon their farms . More than a quarter billion dollars have been loaned in this manner , and millions of dollars have been saved the farmer in interest , to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite naturally . To-day the New Zealand farmer enjoys more satisfactory conditions than any other in the world . Why can not something of this sort be provided for the handicapped yeomen of this land of the free and home of the brave ? A PROGRAMME Summing it all up briefly , we should have for our own immediate welfare and to insure posterity against conditions which will impose excessive and inevitable hardship : Government ownership of the railways , the express and telegraph companies , the coal , phosphate , and potash lands , a more extensive reservation of timber lands , and a speedy cessation of the practice of granting water power franchises without the stipulation of rigid Government supervision . What would be the immediate results ? Transpoitation . By taking over the railway . express , and telegraph companies , Uncle Sam could furnish , at greatly reduced rates , a vastly improved freight , express , and telegraph service with a saving of more than a million dollars a day . The natural economies of the centralization of management , the elimination of duplication of duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect this . Consequent improvements in roadbed and equipment would materially reduce the present awful death toll . And the rights of way would furnish broad highways , already at grade , for the underground gas mains and telegraph and electric power conduits . Coal . Controlling the coal lands , Uncle Sam might lease them for operation at private hands under strict regulations which would enforce the taking of every precaution to save human life , limit the output to actual needs , require in coke production the adoption of scientific methods for the saving of the now wasted by-products worth millions annually , reduce prices all around , and eventually provide for the conversion of all coal into gas for fuel purposes in every section where the plan could be employed successfully . Or he might operate the mines to this same end . Such ownership and operation of the railways and coal mines would put an end to the disastrous strikes which periodically result from wage disagreements between coal operators and miners and railway companies and their employees . Timber . With an extended forest reserve Uncle Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time market annually sufficient timber from these reserves at such prices and under such conditions as would preclude the further increased gouging of the people by the lumber monopoly . Water Power . All future water power franchises would be granted under conditions which would make impossible any amalgamation of these interests and would retain for the Government the right to regulate rates , terminate all franchises within a reasonable time , and provide for periodical revaluations . Agriculture . For the farmer Uncle Sam might work wonders . Owning the phosphate beds , he could reduce present prices at least two-thirds . By developing the potash deposits , and evolving a practical method of extracting potash from the Pacific coast seaweed , the alunite veins of the West and the granites of the East and South , relief would be insured from the German monopoly which now charges a price four times greater than the cost of potash production and delivery at Atlantic coast ports . As for nitrate , the scientifically operated coke ovens would provide $20,000,000 worth a year , seventy-five per cent of which now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WHY OBJECT Now , the paramount objection to any or all of this seems to be a fear in the public mind that successful operation would be impossible at the hands of the Government . The railways sowed and cultivated this belief in the old days when Government ownership was first being discussed and stock-watering was  |p622  much better than it is now . This fear took root and has grown ever since despite the fact that public ownership under the direction of municipalities is being vindicated at every hand . Somehow the public appears to forget the smooth-running departmental work of the Government which disburses more than three quarters of a billion dollars annually with so little fuss that the people are n't even interested . At the top of the list is the PostOffice Department , which expends about $250,000,000 and is fast becoming self-supporting . Then a little $400,000,000 job like building the Panama Canal , without a hitch or a hint at graft , inspires no confidence whatever in Uncle Sam 's ability to do big things in a big way . Queer , is n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bobs up and calls attention to Article V of the Amendments to the Federal Constitution providing that citizens may not be deprived of their property for public use without due process of law and just compensation . Then he sits back and smiles complacently , as if that settled the whole proposition by forever barring it . Of course Uncle Sam would n't think for a moment of flatly confiscating any of these properties . Neither would the long-suffering public expect nor demand that . No one would object to the allowance of a just compensation , save perhaps the present owners . But it would be the particular duty of the Government to see that the compensation was just and no more . WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES DO Other countries do these things quite readily . Twenty-odd years ago New Zealand was parceled off in huge landed estates inhabited mostly by sheep . The Government wanted farms for the rapidly increasing influx of immigrants , but the landowners refused to sell . So the Government simply had passed an act permitting it to use public funds to purchase estates to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lands and arbitrated the question of valuation . The Government and property-owner each named an arbitrator , these two naming the third , and the trio fixing the values . To their final valuation the Government added five per cent , and the landowner was compelled to accept the award whether it suited him or not . He was a bar to the public welfare and the Government summarily removed him . A present-day example was the taking over last year by the British Government of the telephone systems in England . Late in 1911 Parliament decided that the Government should conduct the business . So on January 1 , 1912 , the Post-Office Department quietly took charge of the stations , apparatus , operation , business ? everything . This action incited no revolution . The question of valuation was referred to the Railway and Canal Commission by agreement between the Government and the telephone companies , the latter asking approximately twenty-one million pounds for their properties . After a hearing lasting seventy-two days the Commission awarded them twelve and a half million pounds . A little difference of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finding , and there the matter will end . The way will be easy enough for Uncle Sam once the people voice an emphatic demand that it be done . FINANCING THE PROPOSITION Financing the proposition should be the easiest part of it . There are millions of stockings in the homes of people in moderate circumstances that are holding dollars instead of feet . This army of savers is largely without business interests or experience . Many of them distrust the banks . Three per cent Government bonds would appeal strongly to them as an investment . Issued in small denominations , they would serve as an ideal savings bank for the workingman . In France , where Government bonds are sold directly to the people , every issue is invariably oversubscribed . The demand would be just as keen with us . The trouble in America has always been , not only with the corporations but with the Government , that the bondholding class has been made too exclusive . Corporation bond issues usually carry a stipulated minimum of subscription . With the railways this minimum has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the widows and orphans and the ordinary workingman ! The denomination of Uncle Sam 's smallest bond is $25 . It should be $10 . Then all of us might have a little certificate of ownership in our Government . We could buy them at the post-office just as we do a special delivery stamp . With small denomi/ nation bonds and direct sale to the people these projects could be financed without the country ever feeling it . IT DEPENDS ON THE PEOPLE But before anything can be done the people must be thoroughly aroused to the situation which confronts us . This prevalent National disregard of the future must be put aside for a new policy of aggressive , far-seeing governmental activity . We must provide against the future if the United States is to fulfill its manifest destiny and prove to the world that the democratic Republic , of the people , for the people , and by the people , is the ideal form of government , insuring freedom in its widest sense and forever wiping out tyranny , whether official , industrial , or monopolistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be for you to say what is to be done much sooner than you realize .
