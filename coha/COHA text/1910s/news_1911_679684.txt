txt Edith Hughes , 16 years old , described by her parents and neighbors as a girl of great beauty , disappeared from her home at 7 East Fifty-third Street on Friday morning . She was a stenographer who had just been graduated from a business college , and when she left her home on Friday morning it was to go in seavh of work at addresses furnished to her by a typewriting company which also runs an employment agency . The fact that the incidents leading to the girl 's disappearance were described as almost duplicating those in the case of Ruth Wheeler , who was decoyed to a room and killed while in search of her first position as a stenographer , led the police to take a keen interest in the case . Their search up to late last night was unavailing .
