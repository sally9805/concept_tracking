Schwan THE CALIFORNIACS By Inez Haynes Irwin California , which produces the maximum of scenery and the minimum of weather ; California , which grows the biggest men , trees , vegetables and fleas in the world , and the most beautiful women , babies , flowers and fruits ; California , which , on the side , delivers a yearly crop of athletes , boxers , tennis players , swimmers , runners and a yearly crop of geniuses , painters , sculptors , architects , authors , musicians , actors , producers and photographers ; California , where every business man writes novels , or plays , or poetry , or all three ; California , which has spawned the Coppa , Carmel and San Quentin schools of literature ; California , where all the ex-pugs become statesmen and all the ex-cons become literateurs ; California , the home of the movie , the Spanish mission , the golden poppy , the militant labor leader , the turkey-trot , the grizzly-bear , the bunny-hug , progressive politics and most American slang ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an earthquake , a volcano , a geyser ; California , where the spring comes in the fall and the fall comes in the summer and the summer comes in the winter and the winter never comes at all ; California , where everybody is born beautiful and nobody grows old  --  that California is populated mainly with Californiacs . California , I repeat , is populated mainly with Californiacs ; but the Californiacs are by no means confined to California . They have , indeed , wandered far afield . New York , for instance , has a colony so large that the average New Yorker is well acquainted with the symptoms of California . The Californiac is unable to talk about anything but California , except when he interrupts himself to knock every other place on the face of the earth . He looks with pity on anybody born outside of California and he believes that no one who has ever seen California willingly lives elsewhere . He himself often lives elsewhere , but he never admits that it is from choice . He refers to California always as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to start his God 's country line of talk , it is all up with intelligent conversation for the rest of the day . He will discourse on California scenery , climate , crops , athletes , women , art-sense , etc. , ad libitum , ad infinitum and ad nauseum . He is a walking compendium of those Who 's Whosers who were born in California . He can reel off statistics which flatter California , not by the yard , but by the mile . And although he is proud enough of the ease and abundance with which things grow in California , he is even more proud of the size to which they attain . Gibes do not stop the Californiac , nor jeers give him pause . He believes that he was appointed to talk about California . And Heaven knows , he does . He has plenty of sense of humor otherwise , but mention California and it is as though he were conducting a revival meeting . Once a party which included a Californiac were taking an evening stroll . Presently a huge full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sky . Admiring comments were made . " I suppose you have them bigger in California , " a young woman observed slyly to the Californiac . He did not smile ; he only looked serious . Again , a Californiac mentioned to me that he had married an eastern woman . " Any eastern woman who marries a Californian , " I observed in the spirit of badinage , " really takes a very great risk . Her husband must always be comparing her with the beautiful women of his native state . " " Yes , " he answered , " I 've often said to my wife , ' Lucy , you 're a very pretty woman , but you ought to see some of our San Francisco girls . ' " " I hope , " I replied , " that she boxed your ears . " He did not smile ; he only looked pained . Once only have I seen the Californiac silenced . A dinner party which included a globe-trotter , were listening to a victim of an advanced stage of Californoia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Middle West with a few caustic phrases and had started on his favorite subject . " You are certainly a wonderful people , " the globe-trotter said , when he had finished . " Every large city in Europe has a colony of Californians , all rooting for California as hard as they can , and all living as far away as they can possibly get . " Myself , Californoia did not bother me for a long time after I first went to California . I am not only accustomed to an offensive insular patriotism on the part of my countrymen , but , in addition , all my life I have had to apologize to them for being a New Englander . The statement that I was brought up in Boston always produces a sad silence in my listeners , and a long look of pity . Soft-hearted strangers do their best to conceal their tears , but they rarely succeed . I have reached the point now , however , where I no longer apologize for being a Bostonian ; I proffer no explanations . I make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter of further recognition to them . If they choose to consider that Boston bringing-up a social bar sinister , so be it . I have discovered recently that the fact that I happened to be born in Rio Janeiro offers some amelioration . But nothing can entirely remove the handicap . So , I reiterate , indurated as I am to pity , the contemptuous attitude of the average Californiac did not at first annoy me . But after a while even I , calloused New Englander that I am , began to resent it . This , for instance , may happen to you at any time in California  --  it is the Californiac 's way of paying the greatest tribute he knows : " Do you know , " somebody says , " I should never guess that you were an Eastener . You 're quite like one of us  --  cordial and simple and natural . " " But-but , " you say , trying to collect your wits against this left-handed compliment , " I do n't think I differ from the average Easterner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't notice it yourself , of course . But I give you my word , nobody will ever suspect that you are an Easterner unless you tell it yourself . They really wo n't . " " But-but , " you say , beginning to come back , " I have no objection whatever to being known as an Easterner . " That holds her for a moment . And while she is casting about for phrases with which to meet this extraordinary condition , you rally gallantly . " In fact , I am Proud of being an Easterner . " That ends the conversation . Or somebody in a group asks you what part of the East you 're from . " New York , " perhaps you reply . " New York . My husband came from New York , " she goes on . " He was brought up there . But he 's lived in California for twenty years . He got the idea a few years ago that he wanted to go back East . I said to him , ' All right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how you like it . ' One month was enough for him . The people there are so cold and formal and conventional , and then , my dear , your climate ! " " Yes , " another takes it up . " When I was in the East , a friend invited me out to his place in the country . He wanted me to see his pine grove . My dears , if you could have seen those little sticks of trees . " " I went to New York once , " a third chimes in . " I never could get accustomed to carrying an ice umbrella  --  I could n't close it when I got home . I 'd come to stay for a month but I left in a week . " And so it goes . No feeling on anybody 's part of your sense of outrage . In fact , Californiacs always use the word eastern in your presence as a synonym for cold , conventional , dull , stupid , humorless . Sometimes it actually casts a blight  --  this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I remember saying once to a young man  --  just in passing and merely to make conversation : " Are you a native son ? " His face at once grew very serious . " No , " he admitted reluctantly . " You see , it was my misfortune to be born in Iowa , but I came out here to college . After I 'd graduated I made up my mind to go into business here . And now I feel that all my interests are in California . Of course it is n't quite the same as being born here . But sometimes I feel as though I really were a native son . Everybody is so kind . They do everything in their power to make you forget  --  " " Good heavens , " I interrupted , " are you apologizing to me for being born in Iowa ? I 've never been in Iowa , but nothing could convince me that it is n't just as good a place as any other place , including California . The trouble with you is that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do is to throw out your chest and insist that God made Iowa first and the rest of the world out of the leavings . " If you mention the eastern winter to a Californiac , he tells you with great particularity of the dreadful storms he encountered there . Nothing whatever about the beauty of the snow . To a Californiac , snow and ice are more to be dreaded than hell-fire and brimstone . If you mention the eastern summer , he refers in scathing terms to the puny trees we produce , the inadequate fruits and vegetables . Nothing at all about their delicious flavor . To a Californiac , beauty is measured only by size . Nothing that England or France has to offer makes any impression on the Californiac because it 's different from California . As for the glory that was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome , he simply never sees it . The Netherlands are dismissed with one adjective  --  flat . For a country to be flat is , in the opinion of the Californiac , to relinquish its final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me that Californians considered themselves a little better than the rest of the country . I considered that the prize Californiacism until I heard the following from a woman-Californiac in Europe : " I saw nothing in all Italy , " she said , " to compare with the Italian quarter of San Francisco . " Now I am by no means a rabid New Englander . I love the New England scene and I have the feeling for it that we all have for the place in which we played as children . Most New Englanders have a kind of temperamental shyness . They are still like the English from whom they are descended . It is difficult for them to talk about the things on which they feel most deeply . The typical New Englander would discuss his native place with no more ease than he would discuss his father and mother . In California I often had the impulse to break through that inhibiting silence  --  to talk about Massachusetts ; the lovely , tender , tamed , domesticated country ; its rolling , softly-contoured , maternal-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its broad , placid rivers , its little turbulent ones ; its springs and runnels and waterfalls and rivulets all silver-shining and silver-sounding ; the myriads of lakes and countless ponds that make the world look as though the blue sky had broken and fallen in pieces over the landscape ; the spring when first the arbutus comes up pink and delicate through the snow and later the fields begin to glimmer with the white of white violets , to flash with the purple of purple ones , and the children hang May baskets at your door ; the summer when the fields are buried knee-deep under a white drift of daisies or sealed by the gold planes of buttercups , and the old lichened stone walls are smothered in blackberry vines ; the autumn with the goldenrod and blue asters ; the woods like conflagrations burning gold and orange , flaming crimson and scarlet ; and especially that fifth season , the Indian summer , when the vistas are tunnels of blue haze and the air tastes of honey and wine ; then winter and the first snow ( does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thrill of the first fluttering flakes ? ) the marvel of the fairy frost world into which the whole country turns . Do you suppose I ever talked about Massachusetts ? Not once . And so I have one criticism to bring against the Californiac . He is a person to whom you can not talk about home . He grows restive the instant you get off the subject of California . Praise of any other place to his mind implies a criticism of California . On the other hand , that frenzied patriotism has its wonderful and its beautiful side . It is a result partly of the startling beauty and fecundity of California and partly of a geographical remoteness and sequestration which turned the Californians in on themselves for everything . To it is due much of the extraordinary development of California . For to the average Californian , the best is not only none too good for California , but she can have nothing else . Californians even those not suffering from an offensive case of Californoia  --  speak of their State in reverential terms . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waitress " and the most devoted labor-fan in the country  --  pronounce the word California , should be a lesson to any actor in emotional sound values . The thing that struck me most on my first visit to California was that boosting instinct . In store windows everywhere , I saw signs begging the passer-by to root for this development project or that . Several years ago , passing down Market street , I ran into a huge crowd gathered at the Lotta Fountain . I stopped to investigate . Moving steadily from a top to a lower window of one of the newspaper offices , as though unwound from a reel , ran a long strip of paper covered with a list of figures . To this list , new figures were constantly added . They were the sums of money being subscribed at that very moment for the Exposition . Applause and cheers greeted each additional sum . That was the financial germ from which grew the wonderful Arabian Nights city by the bay . It was typically Californian  --  that scene  --  and typically Californian the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outbreak of the war brought temporary panic , there was no diminution in that spirit . Whether it was a " Buying-Day , " a " Beach Day , " an " Automobile Parade , " a " Prosperity Dinner , " San Francisco was always ready to insist that everything was going well . It was the same spirit which inspired a whole city , the day the Exposition opened , to rise early to walk to the grounds , and to stand , an avalanche of humanity , waiting for the gates to part . It was the same spirit which inspired the whole city , the night the Exposition ended , to stay for the closing ceremonies until midnight , and then , without even picking a flower from the abundance they were abandoning , silently and sorrowfully to walk home . Let 's look into the claims of these Californiacs . I can unfortunately say little about the State of California . For with the exception of a few short trips away from San Francisco , and one meager few days ' trip into the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the danger of such a proceeding , and so I innocently went straight to San Francisco the first time I visited the coast . Stranger , let me warn you now . If ever you start for California with the intention of seeing anything of the State , do that before you enter San Francisco . If you must land in San Francisco first , jump into a taxi , pull down the curtains , drive through the city , breaking every speed law , to " Third and Townsend , " sit in the station until a train ,  --  some train , any train  --  pulls out , and go with it . If in crossing Market street , you raise that taxi-curtain as much as an inch , believe me , stranger , it 's all off ; you 're lost . You 'll never leave San Francisco . Myself , both times I have gone to California , I have vowed to see Yosemite , the big trees , the string of beautiful old missions which dot the state , some of the quaint , languid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brisk , brilliant , bustling towns of the north . But I have never really done it because I saw San Francisco first . I treasure my few impressions of the state , however . Towns and cities , comparatively new , might be three centuries old , so beautifully have they sunk into the colorful , deeply configurated background that the country provides . Even a city as thriving and wide-awake as Stockton has about its plaza an air so venerable that it is a little like the ancient hill-cities of Italy ; more like , I have no doubt , the ancient plain-cities of Spain . And San Juan Bautista  --  with its history-haunted old Inn , its ghost-haunted old Mission and its rose-filled old Mission garden where everything , even the sundial , seems to sleep  --  is as old as Babylon or Tyre . You will be constantly reminded of Italy , although California is not quite so vividly colored , and perhaps of Japan , for you are always coming on places that are startlingly like scenes in Japanese prints . Certain aspects from the bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly tinted houses tumbling down the hillside , certain aspects of the bay from the heights of Berkeley , with the expanses of hills and water and the inevitable fog smudging a smoky streak here and there , are more like the picture-country of the Japanese masters than any American reality . If I were to pick the time when I should travel in California , it would be in the early summer . All the rest of the world at that moment is green . California alone is sheer gold . One composite picture remains in my memory-the residuum of that single trip into the south . On one side the Pacific  --  tigerish , calm , powerfully palpitant , stretching into eternity in enormous bronze-gold , foam-laced planes . On the other side , great , bare , voluptuously  --  contoured hills , running parallel with the train and winding serpentinely on for hours and hours of express speed ; hills that look , not as though they were covered with yellow grass , but as though they were carved from massy gold . At intervals come ravines filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill-surfaces appear trees . Oh , the trees of California ! If they be live-oaks  --  and on the hills they are most likely to be live-oaks  --  they are semi-globular in shape like our apple trees , only huge , of a clamant , virile , poisonous green . They grow alone , and each one of them seems to be standing knee-deep in shadow so thick and moist that it is like a deep pool of purple paint . Occasionally , on the flat stretches , eucalyptus hedges film the distance . And the eucalyptus  --  tall , straight , of a uniform slender size , the baby leaves of one shape and color , misted with a strange bluish fog-powder , the mature leaves of another shape and color , deep-green on one side , purple on the other , curved and carved like a scimitar of Damascus steel , the blossoms hanging in great soft bunches , white or shell-pink , delicate as frost-stars  --  the eucalyptus is the most beautiful tree in the world . Standing in groups , they seem to color the atmosphere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standing alone , the long trailing scarfs of bark blowing away from their bodies  --  they are like ragged , tragic gypsy queens . Then there is the madrone . The wonder of the madrone is its bole . Of a tawny red-gold  --  glossy  --  it contributes an arresting coppery note to green forest vistas . Somebody has said that in the distance they look like naked Indians slipping through the woods . Last , there is the redwood tree ! And the redwood is more beautiful even than the stone-pine of Italy . Gray lavender in color , hard as though cut from stone , swelling at the base to an incredible bulk , shooting straight to an incredible height and tapering exquisitely as it soars , it drops not foliage but plumage . To walk in a redwood forest at night and to look up at the stars tangled in the tree-tops , to watch the moonlight sift through the masses of soft black-green feathers , down , down , until strained to a diaphanous tenuity it lies a faint silver gossamer at your feet , is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woodcuts which illustrate Shakespeare 's " Midsummer Night 's Dream . " Most people in first visiting California are obsessed with the flowers , the abundant callas , the monstrous roses , the giant geraniums . But I never ceased to wonder at the beauty of the trees . And remember , I have not as yet seen what they call the " big " trees . Yes , California is quite as beautiful as her poets insist and her painters prove . It turns everybody who goes there into a poet , at least temporarily . Babes lisp in numbers and those of the native population who do n't actually write poetry , talk it  --  no matter what the subject is . Take the case of Sam Berger . Sam Berger  --  I will explain for the benefit of my women readers  --  was first a distinguished amateur heavyweight boxer who later became sparring partner for Bob Fitzimmons and manager to Jim Jeffries . In an interview on the subject of boxing , Mr. Berger said , " Boxing is an art  --  just as much so as music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time , of balance , of distance . The man who attempts to box without such a conception is like a person who tries to be a musician without having an ear for music . " Is it not evident from this that Mr. Berger would have become a poet if a more valiant art had not claimed him ? In that ideal future state in which all the world-parts are assembled and perfectly coordinated into one vast self-governing machine , I hope that California will be turned into a great international reservation , given over entirely to poets , lovers and honeymoon couples . It is too beautiful to waste on mere bromidic residential or business interests . So much for the State of California . I confess with shame that that is all I know about it , although I reiterate that that ignorance is not my fault . So now for San Francisco . San Francisco ! San Francisco ! Many people do not realize that San Francisco tips a peninsula projecting west and north from the coast of California . Between that peninsula and the mainland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So that when you have bisected the continent and come to what appears to be the edge of the western world , you must take a ferry to get to the city itself . I hope you will cross that bay first at night , for there is no more romantic hour in which to enter San Francisco ; the bay spreading out back of you a-plash with all kinds of illuminated water craft and the city lifting up before you ablaze with thousands of pin point lights ; for San Francisco 's site is a hilly one and the city lies like a jewelled mantle thrown carelessly over many peaks . You land at the Ferry building  --  surely the most welcoming station in the world  --  walk through it , come out at the other side on a circular place which is one end of Market street , the main artery of the city . If this is by day , you can see that the other end of Market street is Twin Peaks  --  a pair of hills that imprint bare , exquisitely shaped contours of gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stage-drop . If you come by night , you will find Market street crowded with people , lighted with a display of electric signs second only in size , number , brilliancy and ingenuity to those on Broadway . But whether you come by day or by night , the instant you emerge from the Ferry building , San Francisco gets you . Market street is one of the most entertaining main-traveled urban roads in the world . Newspaper offices in a cluster , store windows flooded with light , filled with advertising devices of the most amusing originality , cars , taxis , crowds , it has all the earmarks of the main street of any big American city , with the addition , at intervals , of the pretty " islands " so typical of the boulevards of Paris and with , last of all , a zip and a zest , a pep and a punch , a go and a ginger that is distinctively Californian . I repeat that California throws her first tentacle into your heart as you stand there wondering whether you 'll go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swim with the current . Imagine a city built not on seven but a hundred hills . I am sure there are no less than a hundred and probably there are more . Certainly I climbed a hundred . On three sides the sea laps the very hem of this city and on one side the forest reaches down to its very toes . That is , when all is said , the most marvelous thing about San Francisco  --  that the sea and forest come straight to its borders . And as , because of its peninsula situation they form the only roads out , sea and forest are integral parts of the city life . It accounts for the fact that you see no city pallor in the faces on the streets and perhaps for the fact that you see so little unhappiness on them . On Sundays and holidays , crowds pour across the bay all day long and then , loaded with flowers and greens , pour back all the evening long . As for flowers and greens , the hotels , shops , cafes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so cheap on the streets that everybody wears them . Everybody seems to play as much as possible out of doors . Everybody seems to sleep out of doors . Everybody has just come from a hike or is just going off on one . Imagine a climate rainless three-quarters of the year , which permits the workingman to tramp all through his vacation with the impedimenta only of a blanket , moneyless if he will , but with the certainty always that the orchards and gardens will provide-him with food . Through the city runs one central hill-spine . From this crest , by day , you look on one side across the bay with its three beautiful islands , bare Yerba Buena , jeweled Alcatraz and softly-fluted Angel Island , all seemingly adrift in the blue waters , to Marin county . The waters of the bay are as smooth as satin , as blue as the sky , and they are slashed in every direction with the silver wakes left by numberless ferryboats . Those ferryboats , by the way , are extremely graceful ; they look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bay view from the central hill-spine shows the cities of Berkeley and Oakland like enormous planes of crystal tilted against the distance , the ferryboats illuminated but still peacock-shaped , floating on the black waters like monster toys of Venetian glass . In the background , rising from low hills , peaks the blue triangle of Mt . Diablo . In the foreground reposes Tamalpais  --  a mountain shaped in the figure of a woman-lying prone . The wooded slopes of Tamalpais form the nearest big playground for San Franciscans  --  and Tamalpais is to the San Franciscan what Fujiyama is to the Japanese . Would that I had space to tell here of the time when their mountain caught fire and thousands  --  men , women and children  --  turned out to save it ! Everybody helped who could . Even the bakers of San Francisco worked all night and without pay to make bread for the fire-fighters . By day , on the city side of the crest , you catch glimpses of other hills , covered for the most part with buildings , like lustrous pearl cubes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night you can look straight down the side streets to Market street on a series of illuminated restaurant signs which project over the sidewalk at right angles to the buildings . It is as though a colossal golden stairway tempted your foot . Perhaps after all the most breath taking quality about San Francisco is these unexpected glimpses that you are always getting of beautiful hill-heights and beautiful valley-depths . Sunset skies like aerial banners flare gold and crimson on the tops of those hills . City lights , like nests of diamonds , glitter and glisten in the depths of those valleys . Then the fogs ! I have stood at my window at night and watched the ragged armies of the air drift in from the bay and take possession of the whole city . Such fogs . Not distilled from pea soup like the London fogs ; moist air-gauzes rather , pearl-touched and glimmering ; so thick sometimes that it is as though the world had veiled herself in mourning , so thin often that the stars shine through with a delicate muffled lustre . By day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view from the hills shows a scene touched here and there with fog . As for the hills themselves , steep as they are , street cars go up and down them . What is more extraordinary , so do automobiles . The hill streets are cobbled commonly ; but often , for the better convenience of vehicles , there is a central path of asphalt , smoothly finished . I have seen those asphalt planes by day when a flood , first of rain and then of sun , turned them to rivers of molten silver ; I have seen them by night when an automobile , standing at the hilltop and pouring its light over them , turned them to rivers of molten gold . Within walking distance of the ferry is the heart of the city . Here are the newspaper buildings , many big and little hotels , numberless restaurants , the theatres and the shopping district . The region about Union Square , Geary street , Grant Avenue , Post and Sutter streets , is a busy and attractive area . You could live in San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking through it . Beyond are various foreign quarters and districts inevitably growing colder and more residential in aspect as they get farther away from the city heart . Beyond the heights where one catches glimpses of the ocean , the city slopes to abrupt cliffs along the outer harbor , and here are mansions whose windy gardens overhang the surf . Beyond Market street is the area described in the phrase , " south of the slot " . Superficially drab and gray in aspect , it has been celebrated again and again in song and story . From this region have come the majority of San Francisco 's champion athletes . Near here beats the red heart of the labor world . And not far off still stands that exquisite gem of Spanish catholicism  --  Mission Dolores . Here and there  --  and it is a little like meeting a ghost in a crowded street  --  through all the beauty and freshness of the new city project the bones of the old : the lofty ruins , ivy-hung , of a huge Nob Hill Palace here ; the mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ; elaborate rusty fences of Mid-Victorian iron which enclose nothing ; wide low steps of Mid-Victorian marble which lead nowhere . The San Franciscan speaks always with a tender , regretful affection of that dead city , but , as is natural , he speaks of it less and less . For myself , I am glad now that I never saw the city that was ; for I can love the city that is with no arriere pensee . They serve , however  --  those bones of a dead past  --  to remind the stranger of a marvelous rebuilding feat , to accent the virility and vitality , the courage and enterprise of a people who , before a half decade had passed , had eliminated almost every trace of the greatest disaster of modern time . Perhaps , after the beauty of its situation , the stranger is most struck with the picturesqueness given to the city by its cosmopolitan atmosphere . For San Francisco , serving as one of the two main great gateways to an enormous country , a front entrance to America from the Orient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from South America , standing halfway between tropics and polar regions , a great port of the greatest ocean in the world , becomes naturally one of the world 's main caravanseries , a meeting place of nations . Chinatown is not far off from the heart of the city . And Chinatown pervades San Francisco . It is as though it distilled some faint oriental perfume with which constantly it suffuses the air . You meet the Chinese everywhere . The men differ in no wise from the men with whom the smaller Chinatowns of the East have acquainted us . The women make the streets exotic . Little , slim-limbed creatures , amber-skinned , jewel-eyed , dressed in silk of black or pastel colors , loosely coated and comfortably trousered , their jet-black shining hair filled with ornaments , they go about in groups which include old women and young matrons , half-grown girls slender as forsythia branches , babies arrayed like princes . You are likely to meet groups of Hindus , picturesquely turbaned , coffee-brown in color , slight-figured , straight-featured , black-bearded . You see Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italians and Spanish flood the city . There are eight thousand Montenegrins alone in California . I never suspected there were eight thousand in Montenegro . And our own continent contributes Canadians , Mexicans , citizens from every State in the Union . In addition , you run everywhere into soldiers and sailors . The bits of talk you overhear in the street are so exciting that you become a professional eavesdropper , strong-languaged , picturesquely slangy , pungent narrative . Sometimes the speaker has come up from Arizona , or New Mexico or Texas , sometimes down from Alaska , Washington or Oregon , sometimes across from Nevada or Montana or Wyoming . And with many of them  --  at least with those that live west of the rocky mountains  --  San Francisco is always ( and I never failed to respond to the thrill of it ) " the city " . Not a city or any city , but the city  --  as though there were no other city on the face of the earth . All this alien picturesqueness adds enormously of course to the San Franciscan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid in this matter . Indeed this cosmopolitanism of atmosphere serves best as a background , these alien types as a foil , for the native-born . For the Californians are a comely people . No traveler has failed  --  at least no man has failed  --  to pay tribute in passing to the Californian women . And they are beautiful . In that climate which produces bigness in everything , they grow to heroic size . And as a result of a life , inevitably open-air in an atmosphere always fog-touched , they have eyes of a notable limpidity and complexions of a striking vividness . To walk through that limited area which is the city 's heart  --  especially when the theatres are letting out  --  is to come on beauty not in one pretty girl at a time , nor in pairs and trios , nor by scores and dozens ; it is to see it in battalias and acres , and all of them meeting your eyes with the frank open gaze of the West . San Francisco is , I fancy , the only city on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful than any musical comedy chorus . They are not only beautiful  --  they are magnificent . Watch in the Admission Day parade for the Native Daughters of the Golden West  --  stalwart , stunning young giantesses marching with a splendid carriage and a superb poise  --  they seem like a new race of women . And the climate being of such kind that , for three-quarters of the year you can count on unvarying sunny weather , the women dress on the streets with nothing short of gorgeousness . All the colors that the rainbow knows and a few that it has never seen , appear here . And worn with such chic , such verve ! Not even in Paris , where may appear a more conventional smartness , is sartorial picturesqueness carried off with such an air of authority . Polaire , who was advertised as the ugliest woman in the world , should have made a fortune in California . For the Californian does not really know what female ugliness is . I have a theory that the California men can not quite appreciate the beauty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never seen anything else . Nevertheless , that beauty and that dash constitute a menace . A city ordinance compels traffic policemen to wear smoked glasses , and car conductors and chauffeurs , blinders . Go West , young man ! But everybody celebrates the beauty of the Californian woman . Probably that is because heretofore " everybody " has been masculine . He has been so busy looking at the California woman that he has n't realized yet that there 's a male of the species . The California man , I sing . It is curious what a difference of opinion there is in regard to him . I have heard Californiacs say in their one moment of humility , " Why is it , when we turn out such magnificent women , that our men are so undersized ? " Now I know nothing about average male heights and weights . I have never seen any comparative statistics . I can say only that the average Californian seems bigger than the average man . And often in walking through the San Francisco streets the eye , ranging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will strike on a man who bulks a whale , a leviathan , a dread-naught , beside the others , and rises a column , a monolith , a tower above them . He is certainly upstanding , this average California male  --  running to bulk and a little to flesh . Often the line of feature is so regular that it suggests the Greek . He has eyes like mountain lakes and a smile like a break of sun . He generally flashes a dimple or two or three or more ( Californians are speckled with dimples ) . He manufactures his own slang . And he joshes and jollies all day long . In fact , he 's  --  Oh , well , go West , young woman ! Beyond its high average of male beauty California has , in its labor-man , produced a new physical type . It is different from the standardized American type , of which Abraham Lincoln of a past and the Wright brothers of a present generation are perfect specimens  --  the ugly-beautiful face , long and lean , with its harshly contoured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The look of labor in California is not so much of strength as of force , an indomitable , unconquerable force . Melancholy is not there , but spirit ; that fire and light which means hope . It is as though they were molded of iron  --  those faces  --  but illuminated from within . And with that strength goes the California comeliness . Pulchritude begins in childhood with the Californian , grows and strengthens through youth to middle age . Even the old  --  but there are no old people in California . Nobody ever gets a chance to grow old there . The climate wo n't let you . The scenery wo n't let you . The life wo n't let you . All this picturesqueness , beauty and charm form the raw materials of the most entertaining city life in the country . For whatever San Francisco is or is not , it is never dull . Life there is in a perpetual ferment . It is as though the city kettle had been set on the stove to boil half a century ago and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nose . The cover is dancing up and down . The very kettle is rocking and jumping . But by some miracle the destructive explosion never happens . The Californian is easy-going in a sense and yet he works hard and plays hard . Athletics are feverish there , suffrage rampant , politics frenzied , labor militant . Would that I had space here to dilate on the athletic game as it is played in California  --  played with the charm and spirit and humor with which Californians play every game . Would that I had space to narrate , as Maud Younger tells it  --  the moving story of how the women won the vote in California . Would that I had space to describe the whirlwind political campaigns when there are at least four candidates in the field for every office , and when you are besought by postal , by letter , by dodgers , by advertisements in the papers and on the billboards to vote for all of them . Would that I had space  --  but here I must take the space  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has virtually no weather to contend with . For three months of the year rain appears ; for the remaining nine months it is eliminated entirely . And so , with a country of rare picture-esqueness for a background , a people of rare beauty for actors , everybody more or less permeated with the artistic instinct and everybody more or less writing poetry  --  California has a pageant for breakfast , a fiesta for luncheon and a carnival for dinner . They are always electing queens . In fact any girl in California , who has n't been a queen of something before she 's twenty-one , is a poor prune . In the country , especially in the wine districts where the merrymaking sometimes lasts for days , these festivals are beautiful . In the city it depends largely , of course , on how much the commercial spirit enters into it ; but whether they are beautiful or the reverse , they are always entertaining . Single streets , for instance , in San Francisco , are always having carnivals . The street elects a king and queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights , lines its curbs with temporary booths , fills its corners with shows , sells confetti until the pedestrian swims in it  --  and then whoops it up for a week . All around , north , south , east , west , every other street is jet-black , sleeping decorously , ignoring utterly that blare of color , that blaze of light , that boom of noise around the corner . They should worry  --  they 're going to have a carnival themselves next week . Apropos , a San Francisco paper opened its story of one of these affairs with the following sentence : " Last night ( shall we call him Hans Schmidt ? ) was crowned with great pomp and ceremony king of the  --  Street Carnival , and fifteen minutes later , with no pomp and ceremony whatever , he was arrested for petty larceny . " Billy Jordan was made King of the Fillmore Street Carnival . Now Billy Jordan , who was over eighty years of age , had served as announcer for every big boxing contest in San Francisco since  --  well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He always ends his ring announcement with the words , " Let her go ! " The reporters say that in the crown and sceptre , the velvet and ermine of a king , he opened the Fillmore Street Carnival with " Let her go ! " . And for myself , I choose to believe that story . The queen of this carnival  --  her first name was Manila , by the way  --  a pretty girl of course , was a picturesque detail in the city life for a week . In velvet , ermine and brilliant crown , she was always flashing from place to place in an automobile , surrounded by a group , equally pretty , of ladies in waiting . When the deep , cylindrical cistern-like reservoir on Twin Peaks was finished , they opened it with a dance ; when the Stockton street tunnel was finished , they opened it with a dance ; when the morgue was completed they opened that with a reception . The San Francisco papers reflect all this activity , and they certainly make entertaining reading . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten times as large there as anywhere else , and photography being universally a fine art , the papers are filled with pictures of beautiful women . They are the only papers I have ever seen in which the faces that appear on the theatrical page pale beside those that accompany the news stories . The last three months of my stay in San Francisco I cut out all the pictures of pretty girls from three newspapers . They included all kinds of women  --  society , club , athletic , college , highbrow , low-brow ; highway-women , burglaresses , forgeresses and murderesses . I have just counted those pictures three hundred and fifty-four  --  and all beautiful . When I received my paper in the morning  --  until the war made that function , even in California , a melancholy one  --  I used to look first at the pictures of the women . Then always I turned to the sporting page to see what record had been broken since yesterday and , if it were Saturday morning ( I confess it without shame ) , to read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , always before I settled to the important news of the day , I read the last " stunt " . Picturesque " stunts " are always being pulled off in San Francisco . Was it the late lamented Beachey flying with a pretty girl around the half-completed Tower of Jewels , was it a pretty actress selling roses at the Lotta Fountain for the benefit of the Belgians , it was something amusing , stirring and characteristic . Always the " stunt " involved a lot of pretty girls and often it demanded the services of the mayor . I shall regret to the end of my days that I did not keep a scrapbook devoted to Mayor Rolph 's activities . For being mayor of San Francisco is no sinecure . But as most of his public duties seemed to involve floods of pretty girls  --  well , if I were a man it would be my ambition to be mayor of San Francisco for the rest of my life . The year I spent in California they were building the Exposition . They made of that task , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a play and a lark  --  a joy and a delight  --  even though they were building under the most discouraging conditions that an exposition ever encountered . But nothing daunts the Californian , and so wood and iron , mortar and paint , grew steadily into the dream city that later fronted the bay . As I think it over , I am very glad that I did not tell the Californiacs how beautiful Massachusetts is . Because it would only have bewildered them . I am glad that I did not mention to them that I shall always cherish a kind of feeling for Massachusetts that I can develop for no other spot . Because it would only have hurt them . You must not tell a Californiac that you love any place but California or that you have found beauty elsewhere . It 's like breaking an engagement of marriage with a girl . It 's like telling a child that there 's no such person as Santa Claus . There 's no tactful way of wording it . It simply ca n't be done . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time how much I love California , how much I love San Francisco . For beauty , California is like the fresh , glowing , golden crescent moon ; it is waxing steadily to a noble fullness of development ; and San Francisco is like the glittering evening-star ; it fills the Pacific night with the happy radiance of its light and life . I think of California always  --  with its unabated fighting strength  --  as a champion among States . It takes the stranger  --  that champion State  --  under its mighty protection and gives him of its strength and happiness . It is more fun to be sick in California than to be well anywhere else . And I think of San Francisco always  --  the spirit of Tamalpais in the air  --  as an Amazon among cities . Its people love " the city " because , within the memory of man it was built , and within the memory of child , rebuilt . They themselves helped to build and rebuild it . They have worked and fought for it through every inch and instant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city  --  into its great , warm , beating mother-heart . If you are sick it makes you well . If you are sad it makes you glad . It infuses you with its working spirit . It inspires you with its fighting spirit . It asks you to work and fight with it . Massachusetts never permitted me to work or fight for it . Woman is as yet , in no real sense , a citizen there . And the result is that I love California as I love no other State , and San Francisco as I love no other city . I have no real criticism to bring against the Californiac . In fact , reader  --  ah , I see you 've guessed it . I 'm a Californiac myself .
