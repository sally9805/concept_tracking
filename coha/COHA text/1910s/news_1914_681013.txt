txt The ratification of eight arbitration treaties and the rejection by a heavy vote of an amendment withdrawing the Panama tolls from their scope is a notable victory for the cause of peace and for the observance of national good faith which is a prime condition of the maintenance of peace . It is espeelally notable that the text of these treaties  --  the same for all ? renews the pledge of the United States to refer differences " which it " may not have been possible to settle " by diplomacy " " to the Permanent " Court of Arbitration established at " The Hague by the convention of the " 29th of July , 1899 . " It Is true that there are reserved questions affecting the " vital interests , the independence , " or the honor of the two contracting " States , " but experience has shown that in reality such questions can be and have been arbitrated with entire success . The most conspicuous case was that of the Alabama , as to which Earl Russm , for the British Government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British honor was deeply involved , and ended by assenting to a settlement that has proved of incalculable value to both countries . Under the terms of the renewed treaties the responsibility will be well defined in each successive case for a decision that any given question shall be excluded . It is a responsibility which no Government , our own or other , will venture to ignore or to treat lightly . And every case that shall go to the Permanent Tribunal hastens the time when there shall be adjudication , not arbitration only , of international differences . Perhaps the vote on the withdrawal of the tolls question from arbitration is not conclusive as to the final repeal of the exemption provision , but it is clearly very encouraging . There is practically but one opinion as to what would happen to tolls exemption if it ever went to arbitration . Indeed , the friends of the measure have rather loudly insisted that it should not be arbitrated . It was they who proposed to except it from the treaties . They were defeated by more than a twothirds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be got for repeal , but the movement for repeal is obviously strengthened . President WILSON is entitled to hearty congratulations and much praise for his conduct of this phase of international policy . He has distinctly and fearlessly stood for the Maintenance of the national honor which binds us to be honorable , and he has firmly refused his assent to any evasion of fair obligations . He has done this under conditions that were disheartening . He has won the advance that he has so far made by appeals to the conscience and the good sense of Senators and Congressmen , end by like appeal , judicious and dignified but frank and open , to the people . If he wins completely , as we are confident that he will:having in mind particularly the tolls question and that of Colombia , he will not only have maintained the honor of the nation , he will have advanced it and placed It on firmer foundations . It is ' a great and noble service .               @ @ @ @ @ @
