txt Under the trainmen 's law the President is to appoint a commission of three to observe its operation and report its findings to Congress . Although these Commissioners are to be appointed as the result of the differ , ence between the railways and the trainmen , their functions differ from those of arbitrators . Their qualifications should be different , if they are to escape the difficulties which have caused the disrepute of arbitration . As I is known , the custom has been to appoint one to represent each side , and a third to represent neither , but to hold the ' balance of power . The usual result has been a deadlock between the partisans and that the brunt of the decision fell upon the third member . Both sides dislike to submit their case to a single mind , and the result is little different if the membership is Multiplied by two or three to escape that dilemma . In that case the membership becomes so large that there are too many chances of combinations not possible to foresee , making arbitration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to settle a , dispute , but to observe the operation of a law . The law is supposed to represent the interest of the public , not the views of either side . It might be said that already the men like the law less , although they caused its enactment , and that the railways like it more , although they opposed its passage . If the parties should change their attitude toward the law the outlook is for a stormy trial of its merits , and for a wrangle over the completion of the legislation . It is therefore undesirable that the commission should be made up in the manner of an arbitrative body . It would be better that no Commissioner should represent either party to the dispute , but that all the Commissioners should represent the public 's interest first and This Is so partly because the public 's interest is paramount , and chiefly ' beeanSe it is almost sure that the commission 's findings will have something to displease both sides of the immediate parties . The men are to get higher pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of their privileges on the lower scale of pay . The fact that the punitive overtime payment was dropped certifies that the law embodies the ultimate demand upon the railways . Not a word in the law requires payment by mileage , or upon . any alternative to time on the eight-hour basis . The men - will be held to the law as strictly as the railways . On the other hand , the railways are called upon to make concessions in the payment of some scores of millions of dollars above a scale already thought liberal by them . There is the least prospect that Cornmissioners representing either of these conflicting views as partisans can contribute anything useful to the discussion . They will have an . opportunity to wrangle before the commission , but should not be.ailoWed to embarrass the commission .. by wrangles : it The , Pi.esident and ' Congress ' did : " not : intervene in the interests of either , but in the interest of tie : community at large . ' The community:at large should be exclusively represented upon the . commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the completion of the legislation .
