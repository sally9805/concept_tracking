The weather remains unsettled , ? windy and bitterly cold , ? so we are working under difficulties . I made three flights this morning , of about an hour each . The clouds were low , so I had a lot of valuable practice going through them . They are veritable whirlpools of criss-cross currents . I worked in them about an hour , till I felt fairly confident . When I came down , my machine was glazed with ice from the condensed vapor freezing . I never was so cold , in spite of two sweaters , coat , and lined leather overcoat . But a sixty-mile wind below freezing-point is bound to get through anything . I honestly do n't see how they can keep this place going a month longer , as they intend to , the days are getting so short and the weather so bad . I would rather have been spanked than go up again after my second trip , but I had to go just the same . Before breakfast I went up to about .5000 feet , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the clouds , ? and I sailed along for an hour watching a glorious sunrise . The clouds looked so fleecy white , all billows and projections ; and an occasional one towered up like an iceberg . It made me feel as if I might be standing at the North Pole VOL. 108 ? NO. 4 on a snow-covered ice floe . The place seemed to have the stillness of the North Pole ; not a sound , nothing stirring the least bit . I could n't see the ground , so the illusion was complete ? particularly the cold , there was no illusion about that . I spoke of the stillness , which is a fact . For the noise of the engine is smoothed into a sort of roar by the wind , and this roar being absolutely constant , you cease to notice it after a time , and it becomes a state ; thus absolutely whispering silence is there in effect . But let that engine miss or slow down the least bit , and at once you hear it , just as when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticking . I went way up then , because I wanted to try some vertical banks , and whenever trying anything new , the higher you are , the safer , for it gives you more time to recover in case of trouble . A fellow was killed here to-day because he tried a stunt when only a few hundred feet over the ground . Whereas another fellow yesterday tried the same stunt , missed it the same way , and went into a nose-dive , but after 1100 feet was able to get out of it . A little time and space is all that is necessary to recover from any imaginable position . So you see I am very cautious , and I was n't even trying anything very difficult . The nearest example to a vertical bank that I can think of is what you may have seen at some vaudeville or circus some time , where a man gets inside of a huge barrel-shaped affair made of slats and rides a bicycle round in it . As he gains in speed he can move farther and farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ordinarily you take an easy bank or something less than 45 . But when you bank steeper , you have to use your elevator as rudder and rudder as elevator . The transition came more naturally than I expected it would . But the way that nose swept round the horizon was a caution . You know , sighting along the top of the engine-cover to the radiator , you always keep your level by the horizon line . That is why , when in a cloud , you no longer can be sure she is longitudinally level . You can always see a lateral change in the machine itself . I tried several vertical hanks on each side , till I was sure I had the idea . Now I have three things I did n't have when I came up , all of the utmost value ? the spiral glide , which makes a safe landing possible in case of engine failure ; confidence in clouds , which often have to be traversed ; and a vertical bank , of great value in avoiding a collision . That vertical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no greater than one hundred feet in diameter ; and when you consider that you are traveling in one direction in that small radius , it is some turning . It tools me quite a while to start the first vertical bank , for , unlike making the first landing , you did n't have to make this . Something kept urging , ' Oh , go in ; wait till another time ; no one will ever know the difference . ' And then , Well , you have got to do it some time or go down and be a mechanic . ' So do it I did , and the doing was many times easier than the determining . And each thing I do will make it easier to do the next , like a habit ; also each accomplish ment gives such a gain in confidence . CAMP lessee , October 14 , 1917 . DEAREST MOTHER , Now , I want to tell you something which I have n't up to this time , he-cause I wanted to save you needless anxiety . It ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and shall do no more stunts . I did not expect to do any when I first came here , but finally decided I must , for I was afraid to . The fellow who had done them seemed to have more to him than I , and I an ; determined to be as good as any , and better than most , for only so can I expect much chance of coming back . The dubs and boneheads get picked off quickly , and likewise those who lack the nerve to do something and hesitate an instant too long in an emergency . So you see I had to get rid of every atom of fear and gain this quality , which a few others seemed to have . It is n't daredeviltry or rashness ; before going up I had the mechanic look at the machine and give it a thorough inspection , so that I could be sure it would not give way . Then I talked with the officer , and found exactly what to do . First I tried a loop , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple gain in speed by nosing down slightly and then pulling straight up until she gets up over . It is a wonderful sensation , to feel the machine rise up and up on its graceful curve as if some giant hand were tossing it ; then the swoop down and out onto the level . I tried several , until I lost all sense of confusion and was perfectly aware where I was , in any position . It is ten times easier to do than the vertical bank , for that requires a reversal of the controls and use of all three . In the loop there is only one simple straight bank , the other two being neutral . Next time I went up , I tried a stall and tail-slide . That is much the same as a loop , only having less speed . You merely go up until the machine is vertical up and down . There you lose headway , shutting off the engine , and slide tail first for the ground . And as you begin to move , the air gets under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the engine drops the nose , and you come out in a simple glide . It is easier even than the loop . I did it second because the sensation was rather strong . Then we had a couple of bad days until to-day . Meanwhile , I was figuring . I asked myself what is the worst possible sensation I can get . I decided it would be the tail-slide upside down , so I worked out a way that I could do it . Starting out at a simple stall , I went slightly past top vertical ; then pushed the elevator clear forward , which allowed the air when dropping to hit the top side of the tail instead of the bottom , as in the ordinary tail-slide . This got the desired motion ? tail-sliding upside down ; but very quickly the tail was lifted farther , the engine dropping , and the machine completed the backward somersault , coming out as usual in the simple nose-down glide , when I pulled up level . Next I tried the so-called Immelman turn , where you nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up out of the nose-glide going in the opposite direction . It is a turn invented by Immelman , and is the shortest possible way of going in the opposite direction ? far quicker than vertical bank turn , and a most effective manoeuvre for an aerial fighter . Having done now all possible stunts that the Curtis machine is capable of , and in addition invented a stunt of my own , I started in and just threw the machine around this way and that , letting it fall sideways , backwards , every way , chucking the controls this way , criss-crossing them , letting them go entirely ; always the weight of the engine would swing her down and straighten out in a simple nose-glide from which it is easy to pull out level . Now I feel that I have banished every single atom of fear of this new element , air . I feel quite gratified that I have done so , for now , no matter what happens , I ca n't feel afraid and get rattled . Many fellows have been killed by being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rattled . I ca n't be killed in flying now . You see , when I get to fighting , not having to think of my machine , I can concentrate on the fighting , and so bring down an adversary . There are only a dozen out of the whole camp , exclusive of officers , who have done even the simplest stunts ; and my rather novel stunt has caused quite a little interest , which is , naturally , fun for me . Of course it has often been done before in different machines , but it is a new one for this camp . Now I have accomplished my purpose , I shall do no more until we get over to the other side , where the machines are built and adapted for such things . Ever so much love . CAM ' BORDEN , October 16 , 1917 . This afternoon the sky was full of those great broken masses of thick , puffy white clouds , with sky appearing so clear and deep blue between them . I climbed up between some until I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an hour or more , with the wheel just touching their upper surface . I could almost imagine they were turning . It seemed like riding in a mythical chariot of the gods , racing along this vast , infinitely white field , stretching off endlessly in every direction . The clear open sky above veritably is Heaven , as we imagined it in childhood . Occasionally I would pass over an opening so I could look down and get my location direction ; but except for these occasional breaks , the world was completely shut out . The celestial illusion was perfect , and it was hard to come away from it ? really quite a tug . Then came the glide down ? a wonderful sensation to pass through the air with engine shut off so that you really seemed to be floating , or rather swimming like a fish in water , making great sweeping spiral curves . . Sometimes I would drop and tear through the air like a meteor at 150 miles an hour , with the wires shrieking with the wind ; then nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much you could have been with me on that ride , for you would have enjoyed it . It was so beautiful , and to get away above the world that way ? outside of it ? in a heaven of absolutely unmarred beauty ! ... You seem to expand with it ? where there is no measure , there are no bonds . I went up again just before sunset and remained until the sun had gone down . I flew toward the sunset , until I was actually in those frail mists of vapor which assume such exquisite colors . When seen from the ground , they seem to be color-painted on the plane surface of the sky . Up there the different strata of color and the irregular bits of cloud seem to stand out in relief , like the figures in a picture seen through a stereoscope . Flying close to one of these wisps so intangible in substance , and yet so clothed in color , I felt the impulse to put out my hand and touch it , touch and feel color in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 , 1917 . I have felt when I was above there , with the world shut out , that I might meet Carol , for it does not seem as though I were in this life at all . The beauty and unreality and the absolute aloneness are so totally different from any known experience in all the world 's history , that you can not feel yourself . It seems as if it was just your spirit . The grotesque fanciful shapes of cloud-projections , as you wind in and out among them , are so incomparably white , the air is so cold and so devoid of dust and moist particles , that it seems as if there were no air at all . With the illusion of absolute awful stillness , little wonder that I can feel that I might come upon her on the other side of the next cloud . Love to all . CAMP BORDEN , October 24 , ttt7 . MOTHER DEAR , I feel no bitterness against the Huns as individuals or as a race . It is war that I hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to end as permanently as possible ; for it is n't the men that war kills , it is the mother 's heart which it destroys that makes it hateful to me . War personified should not be the fig. ure of death on a body-strewn battle . field , as it so often is . It should be pictured as a loathsome male striking a woman from behind ? a woman with arms tied , but eyes wide open . To kill that figure because it has struck my own mother ? that is what I am exerting myself and all the will in my being to accomplish . It hurts me so to think of the ever-growing hopelessness that a mother has to bear . The impotency to do anything ? just sit and wait , wait , wait . It is so immeasurably harder than to go out and risk death , or meet it , as we can . To me it seems like a great final examination in college for a degree summa vita in mortal ? " , and it challenges the best in me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserve of energy , strength , and thought . As I said in my letter to Dr. Mills , ? a thought suggested by Dr. Black , ? ' Death is the greatest event in life , ' and it is seldom anything is mule of it . What a privilege then to be able to meet it in a manner suitable to its greatness ! Once in your life to have met a crisis which required the use of every last latent capacity ! It is like being able to exercise a muscle which has been in a sling for a long time . So for me the examination is comparatively easy to pass . But for you it is so much harder and the degree conferred so much more obscure . I found it a great help to work with another fellow preparing for examinations in college , even if he knew less about the subject than I , for there ware always things he could help me with , in return for something I could help him with , and just the fact that we were working together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long ' grind ' . and if I should complete my course before you , which means that your exam . will be even longer and harder , then do n't give up ; work all the harder . I think I realize how much harder it will be , but I count on you to do it . That will be your life 's great opportunity , to live on when the weariness is so great that everything in you cries out for ' eternal leisure . ' If that occasion arises , you must hear in it the supreme challenge , and hold up your head and respond ; and then , when the time comes , you will have lived a life infinitely more worth while than mine can be at best , because it will present so much larger an opportunity . It is because , as a rule , men 's lives never have such an opportunity presented , that they look to another life hereafter . But with a righteous struggle such as this , life would be complete . There would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so much the better ; but it can take care of itself , and there is no need to bother one way or another about it . Deepest love and affection always . School of A. G. , FORT WORTH , TEXAS . I am taking too much pride in my clear record thus far to let anything break it . I have never been checked up for being late on parade , dirty buttons , needing shine , or shave , as almost everyone has , one time or another . That is one reason I was picked for a corporal . There are a hundred and fifty cadets in this course , and fifteen corporals , so that puts me among the first fifteen of the bunch . That does n't mean much , and yet it is significant of what I have been aiming at in all my work ? to be bet ter than the average , that is , as in my last year at college ; not only , not be in the D or E class , and not in the C or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class ? better than is absolutely necessary . For considering the curve of mortality , it is drawn to fit the average and indicates a certain percentage of that average that must be killed . Being in the above-the-average class , the curve is no longer true , the percentage is far less . In the average class , say you have a fifty-fifty draw , then it is as likely to be you as the next fellow . In this class you reduce the element of chance . That , I believe , was one of Napoleon 's plans . Ho made a plan considering all known contingencies , then , in addition , he gave it extra strength to reduce the element of chance , until its success could not be thrown in doubt even by something unforeseen . So you see it is n't any virtue in one to be trying for a good record : it is the desire to conic back and enjoy my life , the family , the farm , etc. , that gives the incentive . I knew I could learn to fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunnery , for that requires a different sort of skill ; but I find I am beginning to get considerable accuracy , and before I finish I shall get it good . Then let the Hun do his worst , and I will go him a point better . This gunnery is great fun , for we have so many different sorts of practice . The range-work consists in plain target-shooting , shooting at silhouettes of machines with aerial sights , which allow for the speed of travel , etc. ? that is , learning to give the proper deflection of aim so your bullets will cross the enemy 's line of flight when he is crossing the bullet 's line . Then we have surprise targets , which pop up at certain intervals here and there , and you load , aim , and shoot a burst . It is a training in quickness and precision . The idea is to make shooting as much a second nature as flying . We also have shooting at toy balloons and clay pigeons . Occasionally buzzards fly over , and we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camera gun-practice , flying the machine and shooting at the same time . Then , flying with a pilot , while you stand in the rear cockpit with a gun on a swivel and shoot at a target towed by another machine , or at silhouettes of machines on the ground , getting practice in diving down within a few hundred feet , firing a burst , and soaring up again . You can see it is all very valuable and practical work , and very interesting . Then , in addition , there is the work on the guns , the care and cleaning , and the knowledge of the action and names of parts , etc . All this I have absolutely cold , for it requires only study . We also have practice on jams , so we can quickly fix the gun , spot the trouble instantly , and know just what to do . Air-battles are a matter of seconds only , each second may mean a lifetime , so an absolute knowledge of the gun is essential . Some fellows borrow others ' notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortsighted to me . In case you see reports of men being killed down here , ? there have been three this week , ? you do n't need to worry about me , for in each case it has been their own fault , ' stunting ' and taking chances too close to the ground , so they did n't have a chance to get out of their trouble before they hit . And in this gunnery course there is no chance of trouble , for it is straight work and no solo work , always with an experienced pilot . Lots of love to all the family . January 12 , 1515 . DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER , I have begun flying one type of ma. chine which is not much different from the one I learned on , and shall have no trouble at all handling the other types we most fly . Yesterday two or the machines we are to fly at the front arrived and are being put together . They are wonderfully big powerful ina. chines , holding the altitude record for the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in about half an hour . They certainly will be a joy to fly . Bombing is particularly attractive to me , for , instead of aiming to kill men , as in fighting on the ground or even in scout-fighting , we aim to destroy war manufactories , material things made to kill men . Thus we are striking at the very base of war . And this is most satisfying to me . For I am not in here for the sake of international treaties or patriotism , but to make war on war , because two summers ago I learned how much worse it is than the mere killing of men . In this branch of aviation there is not the opportunity for personal distinction that there is in the scout-fight. ing ; but even if I do not return a hero , I guess you wo n't mind much , and probably my chances of returning are better . Meanwhile there is a great deal to be learned , ? all about the science of bombing , navigation , and night-fly. ing , ? which will occupy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you have far less to worry about than we supposed when I left . Oh , that was such a perfect two weeks , absolutely satisfying and complete in every possible way ; and I live it over and over , and it helps pass the lime till some more mail comes . It seems as if some must come now in a clay or so , for the other fellows have been receiving American mail the last few days , so mail is being forwarded , I expect . You would have been amused yesterday , father , at tea . One of the fellows ? English he was ? came in and noticed we had toast instead of plain bread . ' Oh , toast. ! I say , orderly , have you a few drippings , you know ? ' You can imagine the intonation . Instead of having butter , we use a very good grade of margarine , but in asking for it at table we say , ' Will you pass me the camouflage ? ' Much love to all . January 25 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday they finished assembling two of the machines of the type we are to fly at the front , and one of the English fellows who has been here longest was given instruction on it all afternoon , and then put back on one of the old machines till he could make better landings . Yesterday morning I was taken up for ten minutes ' instruction , made one landing , and allowed to go off solo . It is a wonderful big machine , a regular thoroughbred , as different from these other machines as a Pierce-Arrow is from a Ford . And they are very careful of them , for they represent about , I should say , twenty thousand dollars , and with a little carelessness you could wipe out in a minute the work of skilled laborers for many months . So I appreciated their confidence in me , being the first pupil in the whole squadron to fly it alone . I think I gained their confidence by the way I brought in the machine I wrote about in the letter to Wilson yesterday . Weli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , to try it out in the air and get used to it . Most machines have a very limited range of speed , having to land almost as fast as they fly . But this has a device by which you can regulate the angle of a certain plane , and so make the machine fly level , hands off , or climb , or glide down at an astonishing slow speed for landing compared to what it will fly at . You can land as slow as sixty , and it will fly well over a hundred , and , with the engines which the machines are equipped with at the front , quite a bit faster . But on account of the larger size and weight , a hundred and twenty miles in these does not seem much faster than sixty in the others , unless you pass one of them in the air , or fly down to the ground . Then I made a few landings successfully , and went up about a mile and made several successive loops . The major was most delighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stunted these machines here . But I have never seen such strength , such response to the controls , such a real engine . These are built for service , and you can have confidence in them , and it is a real joy to drive them . After lunch I went up again and climbed to 16,000 feet ? that is over three miles . I noticed not the slightest difficulty in heart or breathing , and I believe that those who do have trouble , have it mainly from apprehension . At this height it was exceedingly cold , but keeping my head in the centre behind the cowling , I was perfectly warm . I flew west over the plains of Salisbury , where so many famous battles of English history have taken place . Then down to Southampton , and out away over the Channel . If it had been a clear day , I could easily have seen France . On the way back I glided down a mile , going at times nearly a hundred and sixty miles an hour . Even in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leveled off to rest my ears a bit . Then , directly over the aerodrome , I went into a nose-spin , that is , nose and tail vertical , revolving round the axis of the body like a corkscrew . I kept in that for a mile straight down , and found it delightful and not a bit confusing . In fact , I would glance at my altitudes to see how low I was getting , look at the air speed-indicator , see to the temperature of pressure-gauges , look out on the revolving country , perfectly clear-headed and comfortable and calm in what , until it was understood , was supposed to be a fatal stunt . To come out , I merely released all the controls , and she came out and leveled off at once of her own accord . I have seen one or two loops over the aerodrome , but not a spin . Then the last mile I glided down in long graceful spirals and turns , and came in . I found the camp , all work stopped , standing round watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and complimented me on my flying ? Splendid exhibition , Adams ! ' He is the funny , former-actor colonel , with the monocle . He even removed it to have a look at me , for he ca n't see with it on . Two or three of the Canadians were asking me how she flew , and they said they were glad I had shown up some of these lead-swinging ' Englishmen . Lead-swingers are those that stall along , doing as little as they possibly can , hoping the war will be over before they finish . There are quite a lot of them . You see the best of them are already over there or dead . Flying this machine graduates me , so my papers are to be sent in at once , and now I shall draw full pay , plus flying pay , and get full pay not drawn since I was commissioned , made up from that date . If it goes through by the first of the month , I shall be comfortably fixed and be able to get a few things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour to fly on this machine now , a few simple ground tests in machine-guns , etc. , and I shall be finished . It ought not to take more than two or three days more . Then I go to the Aerial Gunnery Squadron in Scotland , near Glasgow , I believe , for a week or two , and then Pm ready for business in France ; where , I trust , I shall be able to do some creditable work , for I do feel very well prepared . With such a machine you need have little worry . I mean that . Best love to all . January 97 , 1918 . DEAR MOTHER , I have now only to wait for a clear day to finish just an hour 's work , and I shall be done here . I am so pleased , for I am ahead of everyone else in the squadron , regardless of how long they have been here , and have won the confidence of the instructors as well as of several fellows who have asked to go up with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , it is quite a mark of confidence , for generally you feel nervous unless you are with an instructor or driving the machine yourself . And when I get to France , I am determined it shall be the same way . Before I finish , I want to be the first man in the squadron . It is best that way . You know it is the last man the Huns always watch out for . But you must n't expect immediate advancement , as in the case of Oswald , for our work is done more in squadrons than as individuals ; it is team-work , so I wo n't be winning distinction . However , if I can hold up my position in the team and play with them , I shall be content . January 30 , 1918 . DEAR BETH , I am feeling rather badly off to-night , in consequence of a most unfortunate accident to-day in which I was really a contributing cause , if indirectly . You see , I was the first one in the squadron to fly one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibition to these Englishmen of whatAmerican blood can do . So another Canadian , next furthest advanced to me , naturally wanted to try the same things , and as a result , the machine collapsed , both wings falling off 4,000 feet up , and he was killed . A perfectly wonderful fellow , jolly , and liked by everyone . You would n't have felt so badly about it if ho had been shot down at the front , for there is so much satisfaction in such a death ; or even if he had been killed doing something foolish , or stunting close to the ground . Those accidents happen frequently , and we just shrug our shoulders and carry on . But this was absolutely no fault of his . Furthermore , it happened in the same machine I had stunted in , and while these are war-machines , built to stand anything , I feel , perhaps , I may have strained something which gave way under the stress this time . Of course I am in no way responsible , but it does bring it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Affectionately your brother . TIMNBURY , Aynsurne , SCOTLAND February 19 , 1918 . DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER , Reports in our papers from America are a little more optimistic in tone , but nevertheless , even though tremendous things are being done , they are awfully slow and every minute counts . But they seem to be gathering a momentum which , once started , nothing can stop , and that is what we want . We do n't want to.stop till the job is satisfactorily completed , but it is a big job ; some of its proportions will be sure to be larger than any one conceived of , I believe , in the next few months . It is going to be great to be in on it , so tremendous that the thought fairly sweeps one off one 's feet . It puts all of life on such a simple balance ; here is a tremendous bit of work to be done which completely obliterates the little things of life which always seemed so important in the past . All one has to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything in with one simple sweep , and when every one has done the same , the job will be finished ; and the gain is so much bigger than what it may cost in these little things that they do n't have to be even thought of . I have often wondered what we shall do when it is over and we go back to the little things . I do n't think the new growth and breadth it gives will be lost in a reaction of apathy . I believe that after the war this energy will keep on and will never be lost . It will be turned toward making the little things of life bigger in each individual 's case , and we shall see a rate of progress and achievement in the peaceful work of the world never before approached . I enjoyed Mr. P ? ' s letter with its farm concerns . It makes one feel attached to something substantial , to know the old things are going on ? getting out firewood , and pulp , and so on . So old Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gave us lots of service . I remember how we used to alternate week by week with him and Madge and Bell in the old days when we drove to school ten years ago . It does n't seem so long as that , for that winter is so vivid to me : Miss Davy , Carol , Line , and I together . I can even remember the toothache Carol spoke of in one of her letters to you . The work in the woods , Sid Clarke with his winter growth of beard , the daily lunches with Auntie and Uncle Dan , Grandpa Kilburn ? they all are so vivid to me . I can hear their voices and see little gestures . Uncle Dan and his inevitable newspaper , Auntie with her bills at lunch , old Colonel reaching out a bit on the last stretch , coming home from school in the early twilight of fir ? , winter months , the light of the library lamp shining out with its promise of home warmth , supper , family , content . When these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are immortal , living , real , and in them is such sweet satisfaction . That is why I have been so determined about living with you at Irvingcroft when I come back ; so , when things begin to drop out of your lives , we will have the home running to give a basis to keep all these memories alive , and new interests ever growing to keep life ever full ? our nurseries , grandchildren , reunions , etc . And if for any reason I ca n't be the one to help bring this about , there is all the rest of the family , and you must all keep as close together as possible and carry on the Adams family just the same , for if I am anywhere , that is where I shall be , at Irvingcroft and the farm always . But I shall see to it that I am actually there , never fear . Deepest love to all . February Si , MS . DEAR FATHER , In the old days of college , when a man received a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I accepted it as a matter of course , thinking that the high man received his mark becatise of superior inherited brain-power , and I was meant to be only average . There seemed such a distance between us that it never occurred to me to attempt to catch up to him ; it was preordained otherwise . And yet , ever since the double shake-up I received in the early part of last July , I began to make the effort to move out of the deadly limitations of the middle lot , and was astounded to discover , in the various phases of my training in Canada and Texas , that the high man had probably little better brain than mine . It was merely a matter of seeing that the bonds holding me in the middle class were bonds of imagination , and it re . quired moving one 's feet to step out of the protecting but crushing crowd . So I began to be up nearer the top in various examinations , and in the flying , and found it is not a matter of superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more will . I figured that war is a risky business , but the risk is largely chance . Consequently , if I could master my particular job in all its branches , I could reduce the element of chance to a minimum . You see , I have great incentive to return , so it does n't take much will . But , all in all , I think it has been a real discovery for myself , and that I can profit by the same procedure in my work when I come back . It seems to me now that there is nothing impossible or out of reach if imagined obstacles coming from one 's own mind are got rid of , and if one can stretch his imagination beyond what he supposed were the limits of his capacity , and see ' big . ' Then it is a simple matter of getting up and going after it with a will . I think my experiences have taught me to see things in a larger way than I ever could before ? the bigness of the forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and some of its fundamental muses in human nature , and its outcome in generations to come , has all stretched my mind a bit to grasp it , Then also , more concretely , the new spaces I have run from high altitudes , the new breadth which comes in moving in three dimensions , the sense of terrific force when moving through the air at such new speeds . ' Like sixty ' was the idiomatic expression of speed , a limit of our previous experience . Yet I have moved at sixty and a hundred more on top of that , when , protected from the force of the air , you could feel it in the sort of bursting feeling it gives your head and the fearful roar . Then the new sense of utter abandon and freedom in falling . We used to jump into the hay from ten to fifteen feet safely . I have let the machine fall its natural way when uncontrolled , a nose-spin , for a full mile down vertical . These new things are outside all previous experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we do not know we can look , till victory . These have all broken down limits in one place or another , so that , when I come back and start on other work , it should be easier to step over the apparent limits . This is n't much of a letter as letters go ; but I started out to say that I received the highest mark in the examinations of our group of eighteen today ; so you can see there is sound basis when I assure you that you need not worry about my welfare . This is substantial evidence of chance . If I am better than the average here , I should be better than the average Hun as well . So you must not worry , and must only feel joy that I am having the great privilege of being in the biggest thing in the history of the world . Affectionately . TIIRWRITRY , February 23 . MOTHER DEAR , ? I am afraid , mother , you are taking things much harder than you need ? the tantalizing slowness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does no good to get worked up about them , for it makes one feel so impotent , and yet it makes the desire to effect some change so keen that one ca n't be happy , and being unhappy wo n't help . Many things are discouraging , and yet , if you do n't look at them too closely but stand off and see them as a whole , then you can see how much has really been done , and that it is all so new and on such a scale that it ca n't be done all of a sudden ; the men in control are not used to such dimensions , and so tem porarily can not think in such large numbers ; but they will grow as the work does . On such a tremendous scale , where so many complexities are involved , it would be impossible for the whole thing to be managed properly , efficiently , and swiftly all at once . But it will come about in time ; it is all the time gathering up momentum which , once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still very strong , and can well keep going till America is completely ready . If America were nowhere in sight , the Allies might be discouraged , for , though they could not be beaten , it would be a long costly struggle . But with the sure knowledge of the ultimate unlimited power which America will furnish , the whole morale is braced ; they say , ' Not only will we win , but we will win decisively . ' They pluck up their courage , and can do even more than they normally would ; so it will not matter if America does n't start for six months or a year ; once she does , it will be with a strength that ca n't be resisted . Over here , after nearly four years of experience , things are often mismanaged , and valuable time wasted , yet all in all there is always slow but certain improvement . So it will be the same there . Do n't let an immediate difficulty shut out , by its narrowness , the whole truth which can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , but that is not so much present-day mismanagement as conditions brought about by bad management and financial exploitation long before the war . It is a nuisance and discomfort , but it will be straightened out in time . You know what meat-eaters and tea-drinkers the English have always been . Then to have but a few ounces of meat per week and frequently drink their tea with little or no sugar , is bringing the sense of war pretty close ; yet it really is remarkable how very little complaint and criticism there is . You know how natural it is for people to think that everything is wrong when something close to them , a lifelong physical taste , is meddled with , even if there is no direct connection . I think the way rationing has been accepted in England is one of the most encouraging things I have found . There is enough food but none to waste , and it is very regular , so one often wishes for just one feast of something that ca n't be had . So the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way things are going . Of course they are more used to the idea of privations of one sort or another here ; but America will get used to it in time . So when trying conditions come , and evils are revealed , you must hold them in their right value and not let them depress you . And never let things get into you personally . It is one thing to think about them , and another to get all heated up about them . I am conscious of things I do n't like , or discomforts sometimes , and things I wish could be true , etc. , but I wo n't let them get into the inside , where they hurt . If I can change them , I can do it just as well keeping them outside ; and if I ca n't change them , well , what does it matter , it 's outside . It does n't ? make me indifferent to things which deserve consideration , but merely insensible . You must do this ; it ' s not hard , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by , and after all how pleasant it is . So much for your concern about outside things . Of course , being my mother , you feel concerned about me ; but , except for just missing me , I do n't want you to have another uncomfortable feeling in your heart , no worry about my health , comfort , or happiness ? nothing of this sort . For any limitations of physical comfort are so ridiculously slight , especially compared with most , that it would really be good for me if I had more . And little petty annoyances ore good for one 's self-control ; besides , as I said , I do n't let them get inside . I have never been in better health . And I am completely content , for it seems as if I was never so rich or ever hoped to be . I have absolutely nothing in the world to ask for , for myself . My friends and family have never meant so much to me , and you are all so good to nee . And in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a nature that nothing that can happen matters to me . You see you have no need to feel anything but gladness for me , so no more must you have any troublesome feelings in your heart except harmless missing , which does n't hurt when you know I am happy , as I am . Do n't say to yourself , ' I must n't let him see my depression or worries . ' Do n't even get all braced and say you wo n't let yourself feel them . Just relax and do n't feel them . Even when I 'm out there , you must n't feel any dread or worry . We get better food out there and are done with the petty things of training , and we will be right at the real work , so I shall be even happier than now . And if it should happen that I just stopped being conscious , it would n't matter , because there will be no regret and no dread , just perfect content . And you will not dread any such event , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My examination mark has n't been reached yet by the two groups which have passed out since my group . It was 94 per cent , the average on all the tests we had , and they never give much higher . But if the event came , you may miss me , but it wo n't hurt , for there will be no vain regret , because I am so perfectly content . So remember , mother mine , you are going to relax , begin at once and keep it up , and people will wonder at you , that you are so serene and can do so much because your strength is n't being wasted by groundless or ineffective troubles ; and when they ask your secret , you can say that we are both so content with our situation as it is , that one ca n't be otherwise than serene . You spoke of being more conscious of the grim realities than heretofore . To me the grim things somehow fade into unrealities in comparison with the realities of the heart and mind which arc so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours with you all every day , that my heart is completely filled with them , and I am very happy . I am glad you sent the little farm album , for so many of my hours are spent over it . I often go way back to the days when we were kids , with Ned , and the Bledgetts , and Miss Noyes , over at Hilltop , and again later at the knoll , when Vincent and the Platts and the slews of kids gave plays and had picnics . There is n't one single unhappy memory anywhere in the whole review . And I often roam there in the future , planning the things I shall do and the fun it will be to show all the corners to Grace , the little trips we can take to Port River , etc . And those drives up back of Harvey Hill , and down into Ryman , etc . That wonderful ride we had with Betty and Mrs. Dodge was such fun . It does n't do any harm to live in these things at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my work well , does it ? You see I never realized what a happy life you had made for me till I had this chance to get away and look at it . Now when I come back I shall be able , I hope , to give some of it back to you because I think I know better how to do it . I sometimes feel as if I am taking too much good out of such a rotten thing as war . But still , if we all do , it will be worth the cost , and there must not be another because it is n't fair to mothers . You must tell me all your feelings . Do n't hide them , but do abolish them . 18th Squadron , R. F. C. B. E. F. , PRANCE , March 4 , 1918 . DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER , ? We live in a cosy little hut , and I am getting it all fixed up with the little conveniences which make for one 's comfort . I dare say we shall be here perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can completely unpack and feel at home . I am going to tack up the various pictures which I have of you all , and of my friends , and so I will seem actually with you all the time . We have a new piano in the mess and several fairly good players , and I shall get a lot of pleasure out of it , for I can take myself completely out of my surroundings when playing , and find lots of calm comfort in it . 18th Squadron , R. F. C. , B. E. F. , loaner , March 7 , 1518 . DEAR MOTHER AND FATHER , Every morning our batman reports on the weather prospects , and when it is clear , we have to get up a bit earlier . After breakfast a conference is held , at which the purpose and objective of the trip are given , and any details arranged for . Then the men who are going put on their flying kit and go out to the machines . These have previously been rolled out of the hangars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cameras , etc. , attached , and everything ship-shape . Each pilot gets in , the engine is started and warmed up ; finally , the chocks are pulled away front the wheels , and the machines taxi out on to the aerodrome and line up ready to take off , the engine snorting and sputtering impatiently . As they wobble over the ground , the machines look so clumsy and ill at ease with tails dragging and bumping , noses up in the air . The leader takes his place on the line , his machine indicated by some streamers . There have been no deleted material and yet see in it the small element of danger and the very great interest , which you could n't have if I told nothing about it for fear of worrying you . There are some Hun machines which will go higher than these we use , but there is no machine made by any nation as fast at the high altitudes where we work ; and speed is king . Must get to bed now . Much love to all . March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to have even better machines , the same as these , only improved . Our work is safer than others bemuse of the machines , the height , and the fact that we do n't look for trouble , but fight only when attacked ; and on Wednesday last , when Haig congratulated the brigade for bringing down eighteen Huns , our one squadron , perfectly peaceable by nature , taught six out of that number that we can well defend ourselves . On that occasion , over thirty Huns attacked only four of ours , and ours all came back . But while we are on the subject , I want to caution you about a possibility . One of our machines has been reported missing a day or so ago , but it was only engine-failure , and the machine was seen to havelanded safely ; so the occupants are safe , but unhappily detained in Hun-land . Frequently no word is brought from them , and no one sees what became of a machine . So you see a man may be quite all right who simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to arise , however , as our engines , as a rule , are very reliable . It is merely a possibility , and in case it happens , I want you to know there is no need to worry ? less than ever , for it would mean simply a safe but long wait for the war to end . Love to all . MOTHER MINE , This is just a little Easter greeting , to make you know I am actually close by you all the time . May it give you much cheer and happiness . Tender love , BRIGGS . ( Received on Easter Morning , 1918 . ) On March 14 , a stormy and misty day , Briggs Adams was flying at the Front , with two or three comrades of his squadron . They missed him ; and one of them , descending , found him dead in his air-plane in a field . It is not known whether he was brought down in combat or was the victim of an accident . All that is certain is that he was killed while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
