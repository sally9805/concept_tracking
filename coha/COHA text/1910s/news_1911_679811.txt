txt At 9 o'clock tb-night the exhausted members of , the rescue parties , who had been constantly at work in the wrecked Cross Mountain Mine since Saturday afternoon , quit work to rest . They will resume work at daylight . At that hour only eight of ithe more than 10() bodies of miners who were killed in Saturday 's explosion had been brought to the surface . Four of these were buried to-day . It was reported that ten more bodies had been found , but they had not been brought to the surface . Except the ' families of the entombed men , no one in this little mountain ' I village believes any ? living thing in : the mine has survived the terrific explosion . Seven of those rempved were identified to-day as Lee Polston ; Eugene Ault ; Taylor Ault ; Roland Early ; W. A. Farmer , bank boss in the mine ; Herman Sharp , and James Foust . The eighth was thought to be Alonzo Wood , a youth of 18 years , but his identification was not positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are entombed in the mine has been verified by the mothers and wives . This almost positively confirms the belief that there is a total of at least 150 dead now strewn , throughout the mine workings . No traces of life have yet been seen . For more than thirty-six hours every miner in this region had toiled with no thought of food , sleep , or pay , to remove the debris and force fresh air into the innermost recesses of the mine . To-night they had penetrated practically to the main entry head nearly three miles in . Tomorrow they expect to be ready to work the cross entries in which the great mass of bodies undoubtedly were cast by the blast . - Black damp developed to-day and stopped progress for a time , but the silent force pushed on again , until some were carried out overcome . There is hardly a family in the entire Coal Creek Valley that has not felt the touch of death . The problem of caring for the widows and- orphans will be a grave one , requiring immediate solution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living .

That it is more than a hundred seems certain . It is expected much of the black damp will be driven from the passages to-night . To-morrow , with the crew of One rescue car on the ground , another hurrying here , and representatives of the Red Cross on hand , it is expected rescue work , so far badly retarded , will go forward rapidly . Electrical devices for moving cars in the workings were shattered by the explosion , and debris cleared away in the tunnels is being hauled by mule cars to the surface . Mine experts to-night said it , would be many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the laterals ' that the most bodies are expected to be found . At least 10,000 persons visited this ham- , let to-day , and willing workers were many . George P. Chanler , President of , the Tennessee Coal Company , is in charge of the relief work . He divided the men into gangs of fifty and sent each shift into the workings for two hours . Even v:hen the air in the mine was at its best they could not work longer . The throng of visitors was largely responsible for the exhaustion of food supplies to-night . However , hunger will not last long , as Knoxville and other cities are rushing food , some of which will reach here to-night . To-morrow all will be-provided for . The situation became more tense as each car of debris was brought to the surface , for its driver might bring some word or with the debris might be a body of some loved one . The shrill whistle of the train bringing , coffins at 2 o'clock Sunday morning brought another horror to the already dazed inhabitants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piled near the mouth of the mine . Only eight of these boxes were opened to-day , but the others stand silently waiting . The only disturbance was when the Rev. E. M. Ritchie , pastor of the Methodist Episcopal Church at Coal Creek , exhorted those within hearing to accept the disaster as a warning and prepare to meet death . The minister declared again and again that God has sent this visitation upon the community as a. demonstration of the certainty of death and the ever uncertainty of life . The minister suspended ' his discourse at intervals and burst into song , in which hundreds joined . Prayerful supplication also characterized the impromptu services , which were continued until the minister closed voluntarily . He had chosen a commanding eminence , high above the main entrance to the mine , as the point from which he spoke , and his powerful voice carried his message to the ears of every one of the many thousands who were within range of his voice . Steps have been taken to establish the work of the American Red Cross Society . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the scene Sunday , night . In the meantime the Red Cross flag had been suspended from the Federal mine rescue car and its attendants were prepared to administer relief . No official or semi-official opinion had been given out as to the cause of the disaster . President T. L Stephenson of the Knoxville Iron Company and others interested , had nothing to say . It is generally believed , however , that the disaster was due to a " dust explosion . " An under4aker who examined the bodies recovered- , stated that in every instance the heads were bruised , as if they had been thrown violently against the ceiling of the mine or the side walls . This , it is said . argues in favor of the " dust explosion ' theory . The mine had passed official inspections within the past few weeks , and was thought to be perfectly safe . Investigations are now being made with a view of determining the cause of the accident . President John F. Bowden of District 19 , ' United Mine Workers of America , declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said dust was allowed to accumulate . Only non-union workers were employed in the Cross Mountain Mine , but President Bowden offered his best skilled union miners to aid in the work of rescue . Business in the stricken district is paralyzed and coal operators to-day declared that little work will be done for the next two weeks .
