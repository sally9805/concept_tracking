txt " Ludendorff , " said a well-informed personage last night , " must attack before another three weeks are gone or abandon indefinitely all thought of renewing the offensive . That is mathematically certain . " First and foremost , the internal condition of Germany and Austria is such that a brilliant victory is imperatively necessary , unless the morale of both empires is to collapse with a crash . A few days ago the meat ration in Germany was reduced from nine ounces a head weekly to five and a half ounces . The utter failure of the Ukraine to carry out the undertaking of delivering wheat to Germany and Austria is beyond question . " The Stuttgart Tageblatt and other German papers state openly that down to May 12 , instead of 100,0() tons promised from the Ukraine , less than a third of that quantity had been sent to the Central Empires , and even of that quantity , owing to transport and other difficulties , less than 1,900 tons reached Germany . Impelled to let by June IT . " In view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided that on and after June 17 the bread ration must be reduced from eight and a half ounces a head daily to half that quantity . Unless Hindenburg and Ludendorff. then , can succeed before that date in scoring a decisive victory which shall at least foreshadow an early end of the war , the effect of this new and drastic restriction of food may well result in the most serious internal crisis which Germany has yet had to face . " Already serious ? mutinies are known to have occurred , not in one merely , but in several German divisions in Russia which had been ordered to proceed to the western front . The refusal of these divisions to obey is probably one of several reasons why the offensive has been delayed . " Another and equally strong cause for the hesitation of Hindenburg and Ludendorff is that they are keenly aware of that fact that unless the projected blow results In an indisputable success the effect in both empires , as well as in Turkey and Bulgaria. , would be incalculably bad , while . anything in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stages of battle that began March 21 might well lead in the present state of feel- ' ing in both empires to almost immediate collapse . " The Allies on the western front are now so strong that Germany can not cherish more than the faintest hopes of being able to inflict a decisive blow , while there is always the haunting fear that , owing to her had strategicai position in Flanders and Picardy , any attempt on her part to renew the offensive on a serious scale may bring about disaster . Discontent in Vassni States . " In spite of all official trumpetings of beneficent results in the way of greater unity of the Central Empires as a result of the recent conference between Emperors William and Charles , the fact remains that Charles , who immediately after the imperial meeting was sent down to Bulgaria and Turkey as the representative of the German Raiser , had an extremely indifferent reception in ? the vassal States . Near Philippopolis , on the way back from Constantinople , his train was stoned by a large number of Bulgar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other parts of the country during his visit . " Altogether the Germans are , as General Poch asserted weeks ago , exactly in the position where he wished them to be . If they do not resume the offensive they can not escape the contingency that the people . of both empires will construe die fact as a plain admission that they have lost the power to do so . If they resume the battle there is more than a possibility that the result will be another serious check , the moral effect of which , so far as internal conditions are concerned , will be the same as if they had not struck at all . " One by one all the great German trumps have failed . The submarine and the aerial bombardments have proved ineffective . There remains only the army . " That the enemy will he forced to make a last desperate play with his remaining strong card , in spite of the splendid hand of trumps held by the Allies , appears inevitable . That lie will have to do so before June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all his adversaries , will inevitably he felt more keenly than ever , is regarded here as mathematically certain . " PARIS GUESSliS ABOUT DELAY . One Critic Suggests the Germans Are Driving at Allies ' Nerves . PAR IS , May 26 . ? A cartoon in this mornings Victoire shows two German prisoners standing on a quay watching the arrival of a succession of American transports flying the Stars and Stripes . One prisoner says to the other : What is Hindenburg waiting for before making his offensive ? " The same question has been occupying the Paris press and the military critics during the last week . One of the critics expresses The belief that the German command is waiting for cloudy weather , saying that the allied air superiority makes the German movement impossible without such weather conditions , Another critic advances the theory that the Germans are occupied in clearing the obstructions from naval bases recently blocked by the British . A third critic , who is not alone in his opinion , argues that in delaying the resumption of the offensive the enemy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerves , " counting on the enervating period of suspense to undermine the morale of the troops to a point where a surprise attack would result in a crushing blow . German internal politics , accordine to another critic , is what is causing the uelay. as the final victory on ? hic:i the Germans are counting must not , cor dynastic interests , be won under the leadership of the Crown Prince of Bavaria , hut the disposition of the army must be changed so as to allow the Prussian Crown Prince to have the glory of commanding in the decisive action . Yet another theory is that a renewal of the offensive is only awaiting the moment when the Austrians shall be able to make a simultaneous offensive in Italy , which moment is still likely to require days , if not weeks . Each theory may contain its element of truth , hut one thing is certain  --  that the suspense is trying , not so much to the men at the front , who are always actively occupied , even when the official communications report the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is condemned to forced waiting .
