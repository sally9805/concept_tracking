OO long have we trusted in the magic of a name . So blindly have we believed in the dictum of Washington , true in his day , but later the mere catchword of politicians , that we actually pinned our faith to a " splendid isolation " that has long been non-existent . Like the sons of Israel who roused the ire of Jeremiah , we have said , " Neither shall evil come upon us ; neither shall we see sword nor famine . " And though our " splendid isolation " has proved false , and evil days have come upon us , and we have seen the sword , yet in the matter of our food supply we still see as through a glass , darkly . We refuse to examine the facts face to face . We are like the non-elect , of whom Paul said , " God bath given them the spirit of slumber , eyes that they should not see , and ears that they should not hear . " For most of us still believe that the creation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a belligerent , that peace will solve the food problem as rapidly as the rising sun dissipates the mists of night , and that our tables will immediately bend once more beneath their accustomed burdens . The truth is that we should have been compelled to have a food administrator whether we entered the war or not ; and peace , far from bringing plenty and lowering prices , is almost certain to cause an unprecedented shortage of food-stuffs in our markets and to raise prices to levels not dreamed of now . For peace , to quote Mr. Hoover himself , " means that to the demands of those who are nov our allies would be added the demands of those who are now our enemies . We could not be indifferent to their hunger , and so our diminished stores would be still more rapidly depleted . " It needs no prophet to foresee the result . Any one who can add and divide can tell very well what the outcome is likely to be . When the European War began , American farmers were feeding one hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in addition to feeding one hundred million Americans , our farmers are largely provisioning forty-five million Britons , thirty million French , thirty million Italians , and other millions of Serbians and Belgians ? say another one hundred million souls . Already there is too little to go around . What , then , will be the resuit when the one hundred and fifty millions , more or less , of our present enemies swarm into our markets and bid against ourselves and our allies for our already insufficient food supply ? For , blissfully trustful though we still are in that other outworn catch phrase , " America is the granary of the world , " the food supply is insufficient . The season of 1916 will go down in agricultural history as one of the most disastrous the world has ever known . Crops failed everywhere . The world 's accumulated food surpluses were eaten up as cleanly as the lean years devoured the stores Joseph had laid by in the granaries of Egypt . So great is the shortage of food in Europe that , to quote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allied against Germany will require during the next twelve months 1918 no less than 577,000,000 bushels of wheat , even with the exercise of the most rigorous economy in its consumption . Canada and the United States have a wheat deficit of 400,000,000 bushels in the amount required from North America for the Allies and for European neutrals . " So alarming is the food situation that the officials at Washington said early in the year that " it is graver than it has been at any time since the beginning of the war . " Late in January , David Lubin , the American representative in the International Institute of Agriculture , cabled from Rome as follows : " Food is now the most important matter before the Allies . It is useless to deceive ourselves . I am reporting to the state department and also to Congress that Europe 's crops may be worse than last year 's . " Two days later Lord Rhondda , British foodcontroller , cabled to our food-administration : " Unless you are able to send the Allies at least 75,000,000 bushels of wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , and in addition to the total exportable surplus from Canada , I can not take the responsibility of assuring our people that there will be food enough to win the war . " What Lord Rhondda was asking for , and what he is getting , is not 75,000,000 bushels of our surplus , for our surplus was shipped long ago , but 75,000,000 bushels of the wheat that you and I had been counting on for our daily bread . Living as we do at such a vast distance from the actual scenes of conflict , it is difficult for us to realize sharply what the food shortage means to the nations of Europe . We have been asked to observeasked , mind you , not forced ? to observe a few wheatless and meatless days , which will benefit rather than harm most of us physically . We have been forced to cut down our sugar consumption somewhat . But our deprivation is nothing compared with that of the peoples of Europe , whether belligerents or neutrals . There they not only have compulsory meatless and wheatless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sharply restricted in the allowances of all other commodities . The English , who were the greatest sugar-users in the world , have been compelled to reduce their consumption from ninety-three pounds a person a year to twenty-six pounds . The Austrians have been cut to nineteen pounds . The French are allowed a ration of thirteen pounds a year each . The Italian must get along on nine pounds a year . A German gets the same amount . That is , they are allowed those quantities if they are obtainable . Frequently they are not . When they can get sugar , the Frenchman pays twentyfive cents a pound for it , the German fifty-six , and the Italian sixty . Other foods are allowed in proportion ate amounts . In England cream can be obtained only upon a physician 's certificate that it is necessary to the health of the recipient . One ounce of butter a week is  | the individual allowance in Austria . In Switzerland the people are allowed to buy one pound of rice a month . The milk ration of the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread , sugar , milk , butter , wood , etc. , can be purchased only in restricted quantities upon presentation of a government foodcard . Recently oatmeal and rice cards were issued there , although there had been no oatmeal or rice in the markets for weeks . Later in January Lord Rhondda was preparing to issue an order for two meatless days a week instead of one . In Milan six ounces of butter per month is the individual allowance . In Europe people live largely upon bread . That is why we must send so much wheat abroad . Bread forms fiftytwo per cent . of the Frenchman 's food . Yet late in January the French Chamber of Deputies reduced the per capita ration for the French people to a trifle less than eleven ounces a day . In Switzerland one may buy half a pound a day . So acute was the wheat shortage in Italy last September that it was necessary to cut all bread rations , including the soldier 's . From twenty - two and a half ounces of bread the soldier was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and others eight ounces , though the Italfans , like the French , live largely on bread . By many the collapse of the Italian Army is ascribed to the discouragement consequent upon the cutting of the bread ration . In Finland 3,500,000 people are reduced to a ration of five and a half ounces of bread a day . Mostly it is made of other grains , and it contains also ground birch-bark . Germany 's War bread , according to information published in the " Rheinisch - Westfalische Zeitung , " smells so bad , tastes so bad , and makes so many people sick , that the Government has appointed a committee of scientists to see what can be done about it . The German people are also eating huge quantities of food substitutes . Professor Juckernack of the University of Berlin , in the " Vossische Zeitung , " according to the Associated Press , says : It is useless any longer to hide the truth . Unless the Government actively intervenes to put some control over the flood of substitute foods , the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Germany 's population . . . . The latest products of the substitute mongers are really too terrible to be tolerated . A preparation of crude kerosene is now being largely sold as frying oil , and eight hundred cases of serious illness , together with nine deaths , have been traced to its use in Berlin alone . A preparation called " goose drippings " is prepared from dog fat , egg substitutes from a mixture of chalk and baking - powder , caviar from fish-scales , and bread from straw . Probably nothing better illustrates the present food shortage than figures as to the depletion of the world 's cattle herds . When the German army retired after its big advance into France , it swept before it from France and Belgium 1,800,000 cattle , all of which were long ago slaughtered . By the end of 1916 French herds had decreased 2,500,000 head , and a year later the French cattle herds were reduced to 10,800,000 animals . In Denmark , under a recent order , one fourth of the hogs were killed , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no longer food for them . For the same reason Holland has had to kill a million of her cattle . England , in order to raise more grain , has been compelled to plow up 2,400,000 acres of grass-land , reducing her cattleraising ability by just so much . Altogether , according to the food administration , since the war began , ' there has been a decrease in European herds of 28,000 , - 000 cattle and 55,000,000 sheep . As against this decrease there has been in the United States an increase of only 4.7 per cent . in 1916 and 4.5 per cent . in 1917 in the number of our cattle other than milch-cows , and our entire total of such cattle at the beginning of 1918 was only 43 , 546,000 . When Lord Rhondda appealed to us for those 75,000,000 bushels of wheat , we could ship them to him only by going  | without them ourselves . So we are eat ? ing " Victory bread , " made in part of corr and other grains , and consuming morf potatoes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are asking us to . day for twenty-five per cent . more fat and dairy products than we have to spare . We shall grant their request , of course . That is why we are having meatless days . In October the savings of meat effected in public eating-houses in l'lassachusetts alone by observing one meatless day a week totaled 1,282,840 pounds . In one week in November New York City saved 232,245 pounds . The combined dining car services in America in one month saved 469,508 pounds . Hundreds of thousands of pounds have been saved elsewhere . Armour &; Company , according to a Chicago despatch , estimate that the American people have cut their meat consumption by one fourth . Yet it required all the meat so saved and a great deal more to meet the needs of our allies ; for , according to Professor G. B. Roorbach , of the University of Pennsylvania , our meat shipments during the three-year pre-war period averaged 493,848,000 pounds a year , while last year our meat exports totaled 2,000,000,000 pounds , an increase of 400 per cent . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do cry , " Give , give . " Thus , increase our herds as fast as we can , and decrease our consumption as much as we may , we shall scarcely be able to meet the t ever-growing demands of our allies . For , in addition to the over-dwindling production of food-stuffs , in Europe , we have to reckon with the submarine . In one week in December , said Lord Rhondda , submarines sank 3,000,000 pounds of bacon and 4,000,000 pounds of cheese . And Lord Beresford of the British Admiralty told us last October that by January , 1918 , he estimated that the submarines would have sunk 12,000,000 tons of shipping since the war began . As food is of first importance to the Allies , it is certain that a very considerable part of the cargoes sunk and to be sunk consists of food-stuffs . When David Lubin cabled from Rome that Europe 's crops might be poorer this year than last , he was stating more than a possibility , more even than a probability . With hundreds of thousands of acres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of other acres steadily deteriorating under the unskilled handling of women , old men , and boys , the crops must continue to decrease , just as the herds must become smaller . There is no question as to that . It is evident , therefore , that Europe , left to itself , would speedily starve . The hope of the Entente Allies , of democracy , of civilization , then , rests upon America . Our fellows in Europe are crying to us across the deep , even as Peter ,  | beginning to sink in the waters of Galilee , cried to his Lord , " Save me . " And as Christ stretched forth his hand and rescued him , so we must reach across the ocean with food , food , and still more food . As a neutral it was ours to give or withhold as conscience or fancy dictated . As a fellow-belligerent we have no choice . We must give . " A wise man , " says Publius Syrus , " never refuses anything to necessity . " If the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won , if the world is to be freed from the loathsome and awful terror that now menaces it , food shipments must go on . The breath of life is not more essential to our fighting fellows . And they will go on . Make no mistake as to that . They will continue in ever-increasing volume . All the straws held up in this article show the wind to be setting in that quarter . And if they do increase , where is all this volume of food to come from ? this food for ourselves and our allies ? " From the farms of America . Is not America the granary of the world ? We must speed up our farmers and produce an undreamed-of total of food . American farmers will save democracy . " That ' s what we ' ve all been saying , or at least thinking or believing . Well , American farmers have tried it . For three years they have done their level best ? three years when we were not a belligerent and had everything in our favor . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the world seen such crops . By millions , yes , by hundreds of millions of bushels , they exceeded the greatest pre ? vious production ; and yet it is of the giant crop of 1917 , the largest ever raised , that we have been talking about when we were discussing the food shortage . The greatest crops America ever produced fail by millions of tons to meet the needs of our allies . Yet we must send more food to Europe in the next twelve months than we did in the last twelve . Where are we going to get that food ? Gifford Pinchot , after a farm survey late last year , made the statement that America is headed for smaller crops in 1918 , and that this is the most serious fact before the world to-day . On the first day of February , 1918 , the two million farmers who constitute the Federal Board of Farm Organizations presented a memorial to President Wilson , begging for assistance , for since we entered the war our farmers have been stripped of their helpers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we can not equal the production of 1917 , much less surpass it . " Where , then , is this extra food to come from , without which the forces battling for democracy must go hungry ? There is only one possible source ? the gardens of America  | There are those who laugh at the garden suggestion , just as there were those who jeered at David when he went out against Goliath , and for the same reason ? ignorance . They do not know that a back-yard garden will produce as much food as an acre of farm-land under ordinary methods of cultivation . Three years ago , before prices had climbed very high , we raised in the smallest of our three gardens , a plot not exceeding forty by forty feet , or a trifle less than one twenty-seventh of an acre , products worth seventy dollars at the low prices then prevailing in the rural districts ; and it is a mighty good acre of farm-land in our neighborhood that at that time would produce products worth seventy dollars . If this garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked it much harder and raised a vastly greater amount of food in it . As it was , we took five bushels of potatoes from one hundred and forty-five feet of row , and many of the potatoes were dug and eaten when the size of walnuts . Had they been allowed to mature , the yield would have been appreciably larger . In one thirtythree-foot row we produced enough rutabagas to feed several families . A very few feet yielded a great quantity of parsnips . We gathered beans and tomatoes by the bushels , and all that was from a very ordinary garden . A recent newspaper-clipping says that the 16,796 boys and girls enrolled in government clubs in Michigan last year produced home and garden products worth $250,000 , though they were only a small part of the children of one State . Another clipping says that last summer a Missouri physician and his wife cultivated a back-yard garden one hundred by one hundred feet in *size , or slightly less than one-quarter of an acre . " Half of this plot was planted in potatoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thirty-six bushels . From the other half of the plot they canned , after eating all the fresh vegetables they desired , six quarts of pie-plant , twelve quarts of beans , twenty-four quarts of tomatoes , twenty-four quarts of cabbage , six pints of sweet peppers , twelve pints of catsup , six pints of chilli sauce , twelve quarts of pickles , and sixteen quarts of kraut . They gave their surplus beans , tomatoes , and cabbage to needy families . " In addition they canned considerable quantities of berries and fruits , presumably from their own yard , and had their own chickens and eggs . The United States Department of Agriculture says that a garden ten by twenty - five feet , with a fair grade of garden soil , should produce twenty dollars ' worth of vegetables , and that many school-boys have exceeded that yield . That means eight cents ' worth of food to the square foot . Suppose we reduce that estimate , and say a square foot should produce five cents ' worth . Then a garden the size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth of food , which we know it will very easily do . And it is a poor back yard indeed that will not yield sixteen hundred square feet for gardening purposes . Figures show that forty-five per cent . of our population live in the country or in small towns . That means that nearly ten million families live where virtually every family could have a garden . If we had ten million gardens , and each garden yielded seventy-five dollars ' worth of food , we should have $750,000,000 , three quarters of a billion dollars ' , worth of food ! But city people are by no means without gardening facilities . In Minneapolis , before the vacant-lot garden movement was launched in 1911 , there were five thousand acres of vacant lots within the city . If you divide these five thousand acres into plots the size of our garden , you have land for 135,000 gardens . A recent survey showed 186,000 vacant lots in Greater New York . Probably there are no statistics existing that give the total of vacant lots in all our cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities of America there are to-day millions of vacant lots that could be used for garden purposes . The National War Garden Commission estimates that 3,000,000 war gar- dens came into existence last year , with an aggregate area of more than I , ioo , 000 acres , and that their products were worth $350,000,000 . Compared with what might be accomplished in back-yard gardens , this sum , or the three quarters of a billion estimated above , is a mere bagatelle . In its back yards and vacant lots America can produce not millions , but billions , of dollars ' worth of food-stuffs . The problem is to put all those idle spaces to work . We tried to do it last year by appealing to landowners and occupants . We said , " America expects every yard-owner to do his duty , " and let it go at that . It produced many gardens , of course , but not enough . The truth is that the volunteer system wo n't work in raising a garden corps any better than it does in recruiting an army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Publius Syrus . To have an adequate garden corps , we shall have to get it as we got our army . We shall have to have garden conscription . Coming events still cast their shadows before them . And the shadows of the garden conscription movement already cover a number of spots on the map of America . If we glance at Omaha , Nebraska , we shall see one of the first of these shadows . Last spring the mayor of Omaha , James C. Dahlman , seeing that we were drawing near to war , ordered a survey to be made of the idle lands in the city . Under the direction of Assistant City Attorney Harry B. Fleharty , a card-index was prepared of every vacant parcel of ground in the city . Then arrangements were made with the owners or occupants of these lands whereby , if they did not wish to cultivate their lands themselves , they would lend or rent them to others who would work them . In order that there should be no shortage of seed , the welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost to the various gardeners . In some cases the latter were too poor to pay in advance ; so seed was advanced to them , and they were allowed to make payment later from the proceeds of their gardens . Thus Omaha became one of the first candidates for gardening honors . But the vision without which the people perish was not reserved for Mayor Dahlman alone . That far-seeing body , the Chamber of Commerce of Rochester , New York , also dreamed a dream of gardens . Catalogue-cards were prepared and given to the canvassers of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Cornpany , who had agreed to make a garden survey . Each canvasser " covered " a given district of the city in his regular work . Each one made inquiries as to all the vacant lots  | in his district , recording all pertinent facts on the prepared cards . Within a week the general manager of the insurance company for Rochester returned these cards , complete , to the chamber of commerce . Thus that body was in possession of full data as to the ownership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city , together with information as to whether the soil was suitable for garden purposes and whether it had been planted the preceding year . Thus it was easy for the chamber of commerce to press its campaign to make every desert lot blossom as the rose . More than nine thousand war gardens sprang up , and the total value of their products , as reported by the chamber of commerce , was half a million dollars . Marshalltown , Iowa , went a step further . In preparation for the 1918 garden campaign , the county agricultural agent was asked to determine the amount of garden space that could he put to work . His survey revealed a fine farm concealed within the city limits , for the aggregate area of the unused vacant lots exceeded seventy-five acres . He found , moreover , three hundred tons of manure available for fertilizer that were going to waste , or enough for four tons for each acre . Next , arrangements were made with the owners of these unused lands whereby the latter could be put to work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land and fertilizer . He discovered that many 1917 gardens had been failures because the gardeners were ignorant of agricultural principles . They were trying to raise vegetables in soil not suited to them , and they did n't understand cultural methods . Marshalltown is a city of twenty thousand people , and among its inhabitants are a number of retired farmers . As Cincinnatus was called from his plow to become a public servant , so these farmers were summoned from their retirement and drafted for public service . Mayor S. H. Reilly appointed them as advisers to the town 's gardeners , dividing them into small committees , each of which will oversee the garden work of several blocks . " I asked them , " Mayor Reilly wrote us , " to see that every garden is put in and taken care of . I believe we will get every foot of ground plowed and in use . " Inasmuch as these committees of farmers are to arrange for the plowing and preparation of the seedbeds , it is safe to believe that every foot of land will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured to rich and poor alike , a public subscription was taken to provide money for their purchase . The ovine quality of the genus homo is remarked in the Bible ; but , like sheep , we can be led elsewhere than astray , and in Marshalltown the people are being led toward that union in which alone there is strength . Not to be a gardener in Marshalltown will soon be as unthinkable as not to be in style . But it is not enough to put our vacant lots to work , even though they do comprise a sizable farm in every community . Not until we have cultivated our uttermost garden space shall we be free from the fear of this prison of threatened hunger . We must draft our back yards as well as our vacant lots . We must make our garden service truly universal service . Fortunately , the plans for such a draft lie ready at hand . They are the product of Director C. W. Pugsley of the state college of agriculture of the University of Nebraska , in which State they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for high-school pupils , but they will fit any other workers as well . After organizing this survey force as an army is organized , with officers and subordinates , and assigning to each officer a portion of the town for his survey , Director Pugsley advises that large scale maps be drawn or secured on which is platted every parcel of land in the town . In larger towns it may be necessary to have district maps . For free distribution in his own state Director Pugsley has prepared printed " data cards " on which may be recorded all the facts as to the garden situation , and these cards , filled in by the surveyors and filed in alphabetical order , will provide a card catalogue of all lots and yards . Among the data to be recorded are the  | name and address and telephone number of each owner , the location of each lot or yard , and a description of the same : the approximate area , the condition of the soil , facts as to whether the garden is to be used or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rent the land and on what terms . Inquiries as to available manure for fertilizer are also to be made , and when the survey is complete , arrangements are to be made immediately to supply land to the landless who wish to become gardeners and to insure the working of each plot . Immediately contiguous to almost every town are large acreages of land standing idle . Factory sites , water company lands , and other unused areas near centers of population may easily be included in such survey , so that every rod of ground not only within the actual borders of the town , but all within reach may be put to work . Already enormous acreages around factories are under cultivation , and the area can be extended almost indefinitely . In all the world there are not enough breadstuffs available to feed the forces fighting for freedom . If we are to make good the shortage of breadstuffs under which our allies are struggling , we must more and more give up our own portion of bread . In ever-growing quantities we must ship meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on something else . But in order that there shall be sufficient of that " something else , " we must extend our gardening operations to the very ultimate , and the only possible way to do that is by garden conscription . It is not too late to make a garden survey . Even though it were midsummer , such a survey would be tremendously helpful . Not only would it provide data for the coming year , but it would reveal unoccupied areas where quick-growing foods , like snap beans , could still be raised in great quantities . We have put our hand to this terrible plow of war and we shall not turn back . We have set our faces like a flint . The struggle for human freedom , begun at Lexington and consecrated at Gettysburg , is a heritage of duty from which the people of America will not shrink . In a recent article Margaret Deland said that the women of America are called upon to sacrifice , serve , and save . Sacrifice and service , she said , were easy , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us Americans . Too long have we despised the day of small things . We can afford to do so no longer . One of those small things is our back-yard garden . All it needs is proper direction . And doing this , we shall do even more : we shall fortify ourselves against that day when all the warring world swarms into our market again .  |
