txt The " direct primary " now in progress in New Jersey in respect to the United States Senatorship provides for a more effective expression of public opinion than the unsatisfactory primary ' held some months ago under the provisions of the law . It is the old-fashioned form of " primary- , " and the virtue has not all gone out of the old fashlens . Men act more intelligently when by union and conference they are able to get instruction from wise leaders than when they act singly as individuals . The Democrats of New Jersey in their opposition to the Senatorial aspirations of James SMITH , Jr. , have the advantage of able leadership . How a good cause grows in strength under such a great leader as WOODROW WILsoNle The mass meeting held in Jersey City Thursday evening which Governor-elect WILSON addressed showed by its applause and enthusiasm what its opinions were . That is the true way to bring the views and the wishes of the electors to bear upon a Legislature that has to choose a Senator . Governor-elect WILSON made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is between the election of a Senator free of all pledge and trammel imposed by special interests , and that of a Senator well known from the beginning to be in alliance with those interests . The " interests , " he told his audience , have their baggage packed ready to leave the Republican Party and to come over to the Democratic camp , if they can make sure of molding the Democracy to their will . The " system " he denounced is that of " an alliance between business and politics . " It makes no difference to the special interests whether their representative call himself a Democrat or a Republican . Said Mr. WILSON : It is a matter of indifference to the people of New Jersey , as I have already said in public , which representative of this system Is sent to the United States Senate ; for it is the system that we are fighting and not the representatives . There are some representatives of that system who have , and I believe deserve , our respect for their candor , their honesty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who believe , conscientiously believe , that the prosperity of America is tied up with and identical with the prosperity of certain great financial interests in America . If a man believes that . I must differ with him very emphatically in opinion , but I am not at liberty to say anything in derogation of 1115 character or of his honesty . lie may be just as honest a man as any of us , but he can not think in the terms of America ; he thinks in the terms of the influences with which he is connected ; and a man who can not think in the terms of America can not represent any portion of America . The vital point so far as the future of the Democratic Party is concerned is that the election to the Senate by the Democratic Legislatures in various States now charged with that duty of men who are in alliance with the " interests " will drive away from the Democracy the young men who now are ready in such numbers to flock to its standard . It is against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If Democratic Senators are elected who wo4id submit to the dictation of business interests , the party 's term of power will be short , indeed . Young men , and men of independent minds , would turn again to the Republican Party , which is now in the throes of revolt against the " interests . " It is not mere blindness , it is madness , for the Democracy to send to Washington Senators who represent the old bad tradition . The situation in our own State is akin to that in New Jersey , save that Governor-elect WILSON 'S masterly leadership has there made the issue more acute . The Legislature will have before it the name of Mr. SHEPARD , a man whom no politician has ever been able to control , a man who would never submit to any relations of alliance with selfish interests . In addition to that , he has the ability , the understanding , and the statesmanlike grasp of public questions that qualify him for the office , and that in a time even when there was no question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duties of Senator . The new and sound spirit finds its representative in Mr. S.:1EFAIM . The old traditions , the bygone methods of obtaining party Success by political work and manipulation , having nothing to do with the deciding of great questions , find their representative in Mr. SHEEHAN . The effect upon the Democracy of Mr. SHEEHAN 'S election here would be precisely that which would result from the election of Mr. SMITH in New Jersey . It would be the wanton throwing away of a great opportunity . Hare le tMe Stet* Tellsl ! sst-Ten finding methods of expression in favor of Mr. SHEPARD . There is to be a meeting at the Manhattan Hotel this evening for the discussion of the Senatorship , and to promote the election of a Senator who will be what a Senator should be , the representative of all the people , not of a small part of them , demanding of him a degrading special service . The open discussion of the candidates for the Senatorship is having its effect , not only up the State but in this city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of Mr. SIIEPARD have moved many minds . Public opinion will determine the election , and determine it in Mr. SHEPARD 'S favor , if before the Legislature acts it finds means of proper expression .
