txt Is Lord Horatio Herbert Kitchener a woman hater ? Or does he merely ignore the sex ? Or is he having a good time pretending ? The warrior was in Chicago yesterday . He remained here too short a time to settle many burning- questions , particularly where they related to opinions representing the accumulated sentiment of a life of activity , But one reputation had preceded him to America , and this was of sufficient importance to snatch a " lady reporter " from her regular duties and send her to present the question pointblank to his lordship . In its inquisitorial form it went something like this : " Lord Kitchener , you have the reputation of being the longest term woman hater in all the British isles . Is this correct ? " To be sure a woman hid to do it . . How could even a fighting English lord remain unperturbed , retain his innate gallantry , and at the same time tell a woman face to face that her sex was not to his liking ? Listen . Surprised , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 p. m. from the orient , coming on the Overland Limited . He was here but an hour and a half . As he was about to leave from the La Salle station an interviewer appeared . For Just one fleeting moment a look of grave surprise crossed his face when he saw that a woman was at his elbow . Then he smiled and shook hands . As to the reporter , she reminded herself of the small boy who repeated his mother 's errand no often on the way to the store that he had forgotten it when he arrived : She had repeated the question in its Inquisitorial form all the way over to the La Salle street station all right , but it is so easy to rehearse to a passing street crowd and so hard to put the questions right to a man when he is a big , bronzed individual with a long string of victories at his belt . She swallowed , cleared her throat , tried to stretch her drying lips into a smile , look straight into his eyes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suppose he had said , gruffly : " And whose business is it ? " Suppose he ha &; What argument could one have used ? - - Must Live , - Ilp to Reputation . But he did n't . He just laughed , a low , little , " chuckling " laugh , and said , quietly : " Well , ons always must live up to one 's reputation , you know . " " 0 , " said the reporter , " then it is true , Lord Kitchener ? " His blue eyea , which look out frankly . danced mischievously . " No , no ; I ca n't say that , you know ; I ca n't really say that ; but , as I say , one has some reputations which must be lived up to . " " At least , " went on the questioner , " we trust the feeling ' applfes only to individuals , not to woman as a whole . " ? " Absolutely , absolutely , " replied the tighter , relapsing into an amused silence . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A draged out compliment is worse than none. ? The rte , porter bad a brilliant thought . He Does n't Commit Himself . " And the American woman , " she persisted . Inwardly she was saying : " Ah , here is the subject upon which all of them commit themselves . " But to Lord Kitchener she said : " Have you ma many American women on this trip ? " For a moment he became serioui . " No , " he said ; " no , " and the reporter tried hard to convince herself there was a shade of disappointment in his tone . Wit there he stopped . " But you have known many of them in England ? " " 0 , yes ; I have met many American women over there . " Why did n't he add " and always I have found them charming " ? " Well , " said the reporter , resignedly . " Walla we are on the subject of women , Lord Kitchener , wo n't you tell us what you think of the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never Has Seen One . " To tell the truth . " he replied , " they did not exist when I left England . You see it has teen eight years since I have been home sind really , you know , I do not know her , so I truly have n't thought of her at ail . " Not even the militant suffragette had gained his attention and thought : And this from Lord Kitchener  --  strong , manly , frank , entertaining , the essence of courtesy and polish , a hero many times over , the combination which all femininity has adored since the beginning of time . So , is he or is n't he ? He says only as to individuals , not as a whole , but is Lord Kltchener 's " whole " made up of all the feminine individuals ? Woman in general is interested because some woman in particular is missing a great deal . And if it 's true . a pity ' tie . Arrives from Australia . Lord Kitchener arrived in the city direct from San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British government . instituting reforms , and collecting Informatiqn , whIch he Is shortly to deliver to the government colonial department . He said that he was making the trip across the country as quickly as possible and that he would sail as soon as he could after reaching New York . He left the city over the Lake Shore route on the Twentieth Century limited .
