Franklin , head of the International Mercantile Marine , who arrived on the Adriatic Saturday after a five weeks ' visit to Europe on International Mercantile Marine matters said : " Conditions favor a big expansion in shipping and the I. M. M. is in a position to take advantage of every opportunity to increase the scope of its activities . It is ready to help further develop American shipping either by operating U. S. Shippmg Board vessels or in any ether way . " The British shipbuilding interests are not worrying about American competition nor is Great Britain bothering about the question as to whether or not she is to be the world leader in shipping as the was before the war . On the contrary her spirit appears to be that of desizing to co-operate with all nations in re-establishing normal shipping conditions by an increase of world tonnage . " Mr. Franklin did not think present ocean freight rates were too high , in view of the extraordinary length of time of present voyages , due to strikes and other port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be long before freight rates would begin to slowly steady downward toward pre-war levels .
