txt Despite this menace , . the German machine gunners refused the opportunity to withdraw into the Meuniere Woods . Every tentative advance by our men met a violent machine-gun fire . Holding back the infantry , our batteries of seventy-fiveR shelled the woods on OP of Hill 200 for an hour and a half . Then we charged the hill with the bayonet . Machine Gunners Bayoneted . As long as ' the Kaiser has fighters like those Jaegers holding that hill he is far from beaten . Knowing that it meant death , the machine gunners stuck at their posts until the Americans had literally bayoneted them to force them to stop shooting . There were about 300 Germans there , who were equal to ten tiMps that number in the open field . They were arranged in nests of twelve men to a machine gun , five gunners , and seven infantrymen to protect the gunners . Each man had three days ' rations . They had been put there and told to stick , and they ? did . Their rations are very picayune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of black bread , one tin of biscuits , and one pound of canned pork . After clearing the Bois de Cierges , we took the smaller Bois de Crimpettes , near Cierges . Charged the Woods Repeatedly . This completed , the next job was to storm the Meuniere Woods . To make a long story short , on July 31 we charged six times against the German positions at the ' southern end of the woods , and six times were beaten back . The . German communique laid great stress on this temporary check to the Americans . The bravery of our men was unmatched as they went against the machine guns , in trees , in holes , and behind sandbags , one nest to - every sixty yards against our men , charging up an open slope . The units making the attack were lumberjacks , farmer boys , and Indians . They fought gallantly , but nightfall found them about where they started . But the Germans were greatly . mistaken if they thought we had enough . Shortly after midnigheyesterday morning we trained scores of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Timm Company . Special Cable to THE NEW YORK TIMES . WITH THE . AMERICAN ARMY , Aug. ** and bloody fighting north of the Ourcq continues between the Americans and picked German divisions . The German command is trying desperately to prevent the American advance . Meanwhile we continue to advance . In the last twenty-four hours we have captured the important Bois de Meuniere , have pressed forward beyond , Cierges , and on the left have pushed our lines up to the edge of the Bois de Nesles . The capture of the Bois de Meuniere is our most important victory since the Americans forced the Ourcq River passage . On our left the French , with British units co-operating , by a brilliant operation broke the German hold on the heights north of Grand Rozoy and the Bois ' de Moiriere and Romigny . Dashing eastward , they took the village of Beugneaux and reached the hamlet of Cramoiselle . This operation greatly improved the American line . Germans Lose Strongholds . On our right the French , after a bitter stnirmle , took the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position . Thus the day brought an ' advance on a front of more than thirty kilometers , in which the Germans lost three strongholds . When the Americans ' advance took them across the Ourcq and into the line of Seringes-Sergy-Roncheres they struck two German strongholds on either end of their line , one in the Foret de Nesles and the other in the Bois de Meuniere . To push our line ahead in the middle would avail nothing if the two ends held us up . For the last four days bitter fighting has been going on to break these German strongholds . On the left ' we have fought gradually forward until now the front line is in the fields before the southern end of the Foret de Nesles . Orr right was slightly behind the left , and so it was of more immediate importance ? to attend to the Bois de Meuniere , for the German line along the southern edge ' of the wood made a deep dip in.our line from . Cierges to in front of Roncheres . The Germans had been successful with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding back our attacks on the front at the south end of the woods . The French were on our right in the district east of the woods . Meuniere Woods Stormed . This was the situation when the Americans tackled the problem July 31 . Having been taught-our lesson as to the perils of frontal attack alone on the woods , the operation was divided into two parts . The first was to push our lines up beyond Cierges to the west of the woods , to get the Germans in the woods into a pocket , and then to storm the woods . We had a somewhat perilous hold on , Cierges . Our line there was being : threatened by the German hold on ' Hill 200 , which lies in the Bois de Cierges to the south of the village itself . The ' first thing we did was to strengthen the man power in Cierges . This do nt , we had the GerH guns on the southern end of the woods and sent over thousands of high-explosive shells . At 3:30 o'clock the charge started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Americans moved stealthily , with fixed bayonets , until they got into the edge of the woods and atop the machine gunners . Then the Indians yelled , the lumberjacks shout . ed , Land the farmer boys cheered . They were where they could mix it at close range with the Germans , and that was what they wanted . Men Fought with Eagerness . Their yells could be heard a mile away . They were up against two of the Kaiser 's redoubtable divisions , the 200th Jaegers and the 216th Reserve Division . They fought with vim and joy . The bayonet is a good weapon against gun nests on the ground and infantrymen , but the German machine gunners in trees gave lots of trouble . Lads who back home had learned to ' shoot squirrels put their training to good advantage , hiding behind trees and shooting down the " monkey fighters . " On the ground things went better . The Germans were fresh and the Americans in good trim . Our boys fought like madmen . They had lost their comrades at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . No quarter was asked or expected . The Germans had orders to fight until death , and the Americans needed no such order . Wounded men slightly hurt , who were brought back to the dressing stations , sneaked away to get back into the fight . One boy from Michigan was found half way back to the battle , where he fainted from loss of blood . I saw many of our wounded , . and all were full of vim and smiling with joy at what had been done . " We gave ' em hell , all right , " was the message they had for every one along their way . Without much artillery on either side and without gas , the Americans fought the Germans through these woods , four kilometers long , for six hours . At 9:30 o'clock we took up a position across the.northern end of the woods . The French on the right had rfought their way up gallantly , and it now looks ' as if the German hold on this stronghold were broken . Group of Germans Overpowered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when about 200 Germans got around behind our men . They were chased into a clearing , where the Americans went at them from all sides with the bayonet , and I am told that three prisoners were all that were left of the Germans . These prisoners said they had been rushed from Flanders , taken by train to Laon and marched into the woods , where they arrived three days ago . ThOy were told that they must fight to the death ; because the Americans took no prisoners . The capture of Hill 200 brought to light a flagrant German violation of the Red Cross regulations . On top of the hill stands a heliograph tower , one of those built by Napoleon . The Americans saw a big Iced Cross flag waving from it , and kept both artilliery and machine-gun fire averted from it . When our men were close up many q* them were cut down by fire from two machine guns in the tower . American snipers gained good locations and killed the crews of the machine guns . Captain Boyle , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German gunners dead beside their weapons . To the left of the Bois de Meuniere we made another attack later in the day north of Cierges . After several hours of fighting we drove the Germans from this vantage point . Further west our luck was not so good . Our repeated attacks were met by strong German resistance from positions better than ours . The Germans were intrenched in the southern end of Nesle Woods against our men charging through an open field up the slope . However , on the front from Seringes east , two and a half kilometers , we advanced from 300 to 400 yards . About noon the Americans made a rush . They captured a lone Captain of the Imperial Prussian Guards . He told the American officers that he had led a company against the Americans earlier in the day , and when the Americans were seen to be preparing another attack he had been ordered to lead the remnant of his company against our men . He declared that when the Prussians saw the Americans corning at them with bayonets they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their leader , stayed in the woods rather than face the Americans in the open . One of our big guns today exploded a German ammunition dump in the Wood of Nesles . Prisoners said that yesterday the Germans had the woods bulging with soldiers determined to keep the Americans and French out of the woods . There is no denying that the Forest de Nesle appears to be a tough nut to crack , but so did the Bois de Meuniere . German Gunfire Lessens . German heavy artillery fire has shown a marked decrease in the last forty-eight hours . This is taken to mean another moving back of the big guns put into position against the allied forces four days ago . The German aerial activity continues to be a big factor in his efforts . Despite the bombastic German official statements about whipping the Americans north of the Ourcq , the fact remains that we get a bit further ? north of the river each day . One of the things about this rather costly fighting is that it is teaching the Americans to be equal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no tougher fighting than that which the German shock troops have ut up against the allied forces in the last six days . Beating the Kaiser 's Best . Aug. ** captured documents and corroborated testimony of prisoners it seems that the boche is holding his present line with his best shock troops for three . purposes : First , to enable him to prepare the Fismes position ; second , to enable him to get his materials out of the immediately threatened terrain , and , thirdly , to inflict as much chastisement ' as possible on the Americans , who have played and continue to play such an important role in the consummation of General ' Foch 's plans . In the last forty-eight hours five new shock divisions hade appeared against the Americans between F6reen-Tardenois and Roncheres . They have been hurling attack after attack against our positions , in spite of which the American fighters continue to make progress . The fighting is of the bitterest sort imaginable . Our men are facing the Kaiser 's best fighters now . Early yesterday morning the Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting hold of one railroad statiqn at the north end of the town . Franco-American troops , counterattacking , drove them out . The Americans did . brilliant work against the boche assault on Seringes . We learned that the attack was about to come , and withdrew from most of the village . Two companies of a Guard regiment entered the village unmolested , except for rifle fire from the few Americans left to put up a semblance of resistance . After all of the two companies were in the village , the Americans closed in on three sides and surrounded them . Fourteen prisoners said they were all that ' was left of two companies of about 300 men . Following this , we moved up our lines to ? the edge of Nesles Wood . Further to the east we advanced our lines north of the Ourcq in the day 's fighting , so that now our soldiers are on the edge of the village of Cierges . In. the Bois de Meuniere the Germans have excellent defenses of great strength . Instead of trying to rush the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the sides , yesterday gained control of the southern half of the forest . Possession of this woods completely by our troops will probably force the Germans on the right to fall back a distance of five or six kilometers on a considerable front . French General 's Praise . General de Goutte , commanding the army of which the American units north of the Ourcq are a part , received the American correspondents yesterday and asked them to express to the American people the admiration of the French Army for the fighting qualities of the American soldiers . He said he regarded it as an honor to ' command . such men , and that their achievement had been of great benefit in the execution of the allied plans and their behavior had been above all praise . He said their country should he . proud of soldiers who defeated the best regiments in the German Army . The General declared that what the Americans had done so far held out glorious exvectation of what the greater American Army . would do . General de Goutte said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far back the Germans would be driven , he refused to make a prediction . In detail the General kindly explained to the correspondents the inception and progress of the drive . He said the future fighting would be much Harder than that part of the drive behind us , but declared that , with the help of the Americans , the allied command had little doubt of the result . The General recalled that during thi Boxer rebellion he had in China seen something of the American , officers who are now in France. ? A General commanding a division in which units of our troops not beforehand fully trained have been fighting praised their work . General Bailloud recalled pleasantly that when he was commanding at Saloniki American correspondents had asked for his picture . He said he tolcl them it was 3 francs seated , 5 francs standing , and 10 francs on horseback . After the pictures had been taken , he said , he . received the amounts due , which totaled 300 francs . Then he explained that he gave this money as a bounty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a dead German , 3 francs for a dead Austrian , 2 ' francs for a dead Bulgar , and 1 franc for a dead Turk . Not Chained to Guns . I have investigated with some care stories of women operating German machine guns and of Germans being chained to machine guns . Both are unfounded in fact . The story of Germans chained to machine guns seems clue to the fact that the light German machine gun is carried by a chain across the soldier 's back , and the chain strap is used as a rest by the gunners operating the heavy German machine guns . German gunners Who were shot sometimes fell from trees with these chains about them . This is the official explanation of the oft-repeated yarn .
