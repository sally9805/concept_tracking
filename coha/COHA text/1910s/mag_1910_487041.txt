For the first time in nearly two decades the Democratic party finds itself within hailing distance of control of the national government . In the House of Representatives , when the present Congress expires , the Democrats . will have a good working majority ; and even in the Senate they will probably come so near a majority as to make joint movements with Republican Senators of insurgent proclivities an easy possibility . The campaign just closed was distinguished from all the campaigns that have preceded'it since 1896 by the com-plete absence of the Bryan issue . It is a Democratic sweep in which there was no distinction between Cleveland men and Bryan men , no looking forward to a renewal of the perennial candidacy of the " peerless leader . " The party is thus , on the surface at least , in excellent shape for the Presidential contest of 1912 . It is in the fortunate position of having a strong place in the political battleground , and yet being exempt from the responsibility of the actual administration of the government ; but if it shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a continuance of public wrath against the Republicans , it will certainly not deserve , and in all probability will not receive , the prize now apparently within its grasp . Above all , it must show that it is in earnest with the great questions of the day , such as the tariff , and is . ready to deal with them at once vigorously and intelligently . The absurd allegation that the only issue in New York State was the men-ace of an alliance between Wall Street and Tammany Hall is effectually disposed of . For , if there is one thing that stands out above all else it is that Dix owes his election not to a tremendous Tammany vote , for the plurality in the greater city has several times been exceeded , but to the falling off in the Republican vote up the State . Precisely as the independent Democrats left their party in 1906 and 1908 to make possible the election and reelection of Charles E. Hughes , so independent Republicans all over the State have voted John A. Dix into office . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 105,081 , where Coler 's plurality in 1902 was 126,000 . Obviously , whether because of the labor issue or for some other reason , Dix disappointed Tammany 's hopes in the city and would have been defeated had Stimson polled above the Bronx the Hughes vote of either 1906 or 1908 . So far from being menaced by " corrupt " influences in New York city , the real danger to the Stimson-Roosevelt campaign lay all the while in the sinister activities of the " ticker-crowd " among the farmers and the " burglar-vote " in the small towns . The complete overturn in New Jersey is at once a proof of the discrimination and independence of the voters of that State and a splendid triumph for Woodrow Wilson . He was aided , of course , by the general Democratic drift , but the outstanding fact in connection with his election as Governor is that he , a politically unknown man , should have made his own campaign and , ? by sheer appeals to intelligence , should have so manifestly won the votes of thousands of Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking example of what can be done by a man of great ability debating public questions upon the very highest plane , and throwing himself upon the mind and conscience of the voters . It was no partisan victory that Wilson has won , but one born of the general good sense of citizens who simply could not refuse to avail themselves of the services of a man of such demonstrated capacity and character . ? Nothing is so astounding as the news from Massachusetts . That , in a campaign of less than three weeks , after the misbehavior of the Democratic Convention , Gov . Draper could be defeated no one could have imagined . The Governor himself , after the Faneuil Hall riot , was so sure of success that he made several speeches upon the hopeless political incapacity of the Democrats . Well , they have now turned him out of office in the shortest campaign cm record , thanks to Mr. RooseveltV attack on Foss , the great unpopularity of Senator Lodge , and the general dissatisfaction with the Payne-Aldrich tariff . The rebuke to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket appears to have been elected , and the Legislature remains theirs . The significance of this can not be misunderstood ; hidebound protection Massachusetts wants no more of the Payne-AldrichCannon kind of tariff revision . As for the independent Democrats , there will be rejoicing among many of them that the defeat of the candidates for the minor offices will be something of a check to the Fitzgerald-Lomasney machine , which is beginning to be as feared in Boston as is Tammany here . Finally , Senator Lodge must still be trembling in his shoes ; so many of the Republican legislators have pledged themselves against him . The decisive victory won by Gov . Harmon in Ohio is matter for hearty congratulation . In a State strongly Republican , he was elected to the Governorship two years ago by a plurality of 19,372 , in the face of a Republican plurality ; , of 69,591 in the vote for President . This remarkable tribute of public confidence has now been renewed , after he had been subjected to a two years ' trial in the office of Governor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Harmon represents a type of sturdy Democrat which it is most gratifying to see at the front , and it is of good augury for the party in the nation that his credentials as one of the foremost figures in the party have thus been emphatically confirmed . A special reason for taking pleasure in the result , aside from Its larger significance , lies in the circumstance that the irresponsible attack made in the closing days of the campaign upon the integrity of his conduct as receiver of the Cincinnati , Hamilton and Dayton Railroad has received , the rebuke it deserved . To the credit of the Republican press of the State , not a single newspaper of standing , it is said , gave any editorial support to this reckless charge . We have no wish to rub salt into any man 's wounds , but it is plain , in the cold light of " the morning after , " that Mr. RooSevelt 's course since his return in June has been one long series of political blunders . On the supposition , which his closest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a nomination for the Presidency in 1912 , it can only be said that he misread the situation utterly , and acted like a man whose famed political skill had entirely deserted him . Had he gone quietly to Oyster Bay and maintained a dignified silence throughout the campaign , defeat would have come to his party , but a great cry for him as the only compeller of victory would have been heard . He was probably misled by over-zealous friends . They flocked to him at Saga-more Hill and informed him that the country was not only clamorous for his return to power , but was ripe for radicalism . The touring of the country followed ; the car-end harangues : the ostentatious ignoring of the President ; the mischievous Osawatomie speech . Instantly the reaction set in , big with the threat of revolt , but the more he was Protested with and opposed , the more headstrong and violent Mr. Roosevelt showed himself . He could brook no question of his infallibility , and bore himself as one whose word was necessarily a fiat with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief architect of disaster . He has demonstrated the fact that there are thousands of Republicans who will not vote for him or his nominees or his novel doctrines . There has appeared to be a fatal quality in his endorsement , so that nearly every man whom he lauded in different parts of the country has been defeated , while the men that he singled out for vituperation ? Dix , Foss , Baldwin , Harmon  --  have been triumphantly elected . It is always gratifying to see young Americans displaying the independent spirit that made this nation . It is especially gratifying to see it displayed in the halls of learning . There can be , accordingly , but one opinion upon the fight of the Columbia " men " for the abrogation of the university rule forbidding smoking in any of the lecture rooms or hallways of the buildings on the campus , with the exception of the two dormitories . As they argue , with unanswerable logic , the members of the faculty are able to step into their offices between lectures for a quiet smoke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tion will lead to a juster view of the prerogatives of an instructor . But the most interesting , not to say significant , feature of the affair is the reputed origin of the anti-smoking rule . Even before the existence of the rule , there was one place where there was no smoking , and that was Hamilton Hall , the assigned reason being " the wishes of Dean Van Amringe . " The university authorities , it is reported without a trace of a smile , " having observed the manner . in which the dean 's wishes were respected , " grew bold , and decided to extend formally to all buildings a condition which prevailed informally at one of them . And so , once more , law received the acknowledgment of unwilling obedience in a matter in which deference had been cheerfully granted to a personality . All Kentuckians will agree with the assertion of the Pall Mall Gazette 's correspondent that the best English is spoken in that land of fair women and fast horses . James Russell Lowell used to urge the same for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted  --  when Lowell himself was there to speak it . Nowhere is the eagerness of the human race to die for a cause they do not understand more strikingly illustrated than in the domain of language . The inhabitants of the mountains of eastern Kentucky , we are assured , are to-day speaking the language of Shakespeare , argal , theirs is the best English . Yet if we could resuscitate a Jacobean , we fear he would meet with instant repudiation at the hands of these very Kentuckians for speaking like an Irishman . By the same reasoning , moreover , the speech of the educated Londoner is the worst English in the world , ' since it has probably departed furthest from a Shakespearean norm . As a matter of fact , the best English , if by that is meant the best talk , is a fairly uniform commodity in London , in New York , in Sydney , and among the cultivated classes of Kentucky . As for pronunciation , that changes from age to age , from region to region , and the best is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever reason . Positive assurances come from London that the conference between Liberal and Conservative leaders is to issue in a much broader scheme than was thought of when the committee was first named . Appointed to devise some means of quieting the controversy about the veto of the House of Lords , it has been led on , in the course of meeting after meeting , to consider a comprehensive plan to make over the House of Lords entirely , to grant some form of home rule to Ireland and also to Scotland and Wales , and to give the self-governing colonies representation at Westminster and a voice in the British Government . Such a vast project involves constructive statesmanship of the highest order ; and it is naturally felt that no mere report from a conference committee , however able and authoritative , nor any precipitation of the great subject upon Parliament , would meet the needs of the case . Accordingly , there has for some time been a rumor that the recommendation of the conference would be to call a constitutional convention to pass upon the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , in fact , be laid before Parliament as soon as it meets . Analogies from American and recent South African experience are freely - cited . There is , however , one marked difference : the Annapolis and the Philadelphia and the Bloemfontein conventions met in order to form " a more perfect union . " But the British constitutional convention , if we are to have such a novelty , would consider relaxing and modifying a union which has proved unworkable . For details we must wait till the official statement is made to Parliament , but the very fact of the long-continued and friendly conference of the leaders of opposing parties has already had a marked influence in allaying political bitterness in England , and if the- final result be of the nature indicated , we are on the eve of momentous changes . That the expeditious and business-like conduct of great criminal trials in England does not mean any less regard for the rights of the accused , or for the interests of truth , than is to be found in the long-drawn-out trials customary in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full report of the last day 's proceedings in the Crippen trial , as printed in the London Times of October 24 . Not only was the summing-up of the evidence by the Lord Chief Justice , who presided at the trial , a masterly presentation of the testimony in all its important bearings ; but the closing argument for the prosecution showed such accuracy and definiteness of aim , such clear and convincing reasoning , such a sticking to the points really bearing on the determination of the truth , as one associates rather with the idea of an address to a body of scientific thinkers than with that of a speech to a jury . Crippen was convicted because the evidence . really left no room for reasonable doubt that he had committed the crime ; and he was convicted so promptly  --  he was sentenced to death within five days of the impanel-ling of the jury  --  because the whole mechanism of the law was adjusted to the single purpose of getting at the essential truth of the case . The putting in of a mass of factitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution of irrelevant problems , so far from conducing to a more perfect working of the machinery , clogs it with dust and all manner of obstacles , and makes its action not only vastly slower , but also far less certain and less accurate . American politicians are not often . called upon to address universities , but in Great Britain the custom still holds . Public men count it an honor to be elected rector of one of the Scottish universities , as Mr. Asquith was a fe7 months ago . , , His Rectorial address was recently given , and in the course of it he made a special plea for the cultivation of style . Dwelling for a moment upon the possibly unavoidable perils of specialization in modern education , and expressing a regret at the diminishing numbers of " all-round " scholars . the Prime Minister argued that , apart from either genius or special knowledge , there was such a thing as sense for literary form which every literary man ought to feel it a duty to nourish and develop . It is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; what he referred to was precision , fitness , and harmony in expression . And there was force in his contention that such qualities are not beyond the mastery of ordinary men if they will but take pains . He said : A vast deal of the slipshod and prolix stuff which we are compelled to read or to listen to is , of course , born of sheer idleness . When , as so often happens , a man takes an hour to say what might have been as well or better said in twenty minutes , spreads over twenty pages what could easily have been exhausted in ten , the of-. fence in a large majority of cases is not due so much to vanity or to indifference to the feelings of others as to the inability or unwillingness to take pains . And the uncritical world , just as it is apt to mistake noise of utterance for firmness of character , has an almost invincible tendency to think that a writer or orator can not be eloquent unless he is also diffuse . The British Premier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His speeches are seldom long , compared with those of other Parliamentary orators , and are , as a rule , marked by a lucid compactness . The resignation of the French Cabinet , following directly upon a strong vote of confidence in the Premier by the Chamber , is reasonably explained as due to the desire of M. Briand to organize a united and homogeneous Min- ' istry . This task has already been laid upon him by President FaIlieres , and Briand has accepted . It certainly seems that this is no time for France to swap horses while crossing a stream . Briand has shown himself a strong man whom the country is ready to support in a crisis ; and if he has a positive programme to deal effectively with such a threatening difficulty as lately confronted France in the strike of the employees on the state railways , it is desirable that he should work with colleagues entirely in sympathy with his measures . Two or three members of the Cabinet are known not to have been ; and we shall probably see now a reorganization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to come . Yet French precedents of recent years are not in favor of Ministerial stability ; and if Briand falls after having scored a victory in the Chamber , he will not be the first Premier to have done so . The beggar vote evidently does not influence the official actions of the Amir of Afghanistan , who has ordered the poor of Jellalabad to clear the iljungle of drought-resisting shrubs " which bear the deceptive name of the Lakhi forest . The order is accompanied by a promise of grants of land in the vicinity for three years , rent-free , and of water from a " projected " canal . The Calcutta Eagtishman , is doubtless quite right in its assertion that , " even if there were any intention of , constructing a canal , " no amount of water would make the barren and rocky soil productive , but we do not suppose that this fact will cause any deep grief among the beggar population . These men , literally wearing the cloak of religion , by day " demand money by threats and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor " there may be in setting them to work , and whatever the Amir 's motives may be , there can be no doubt that one of the best things that could happen , for them no less than for their victims , would be their adoption of an honest livelihood . It would doubtless be involuntary , but that would be nothing against it . It is a question how many representatives of the enlightened nations would work with no spur except that of their own wills . Politics in Liberia presents certain parallels to politics here . There is an oddly archaic echo , for example , in the statement that but for the anti-thirdterm spirit , " as well as the President 's own declaration against a return to the executive mansion , there would not be the slightest doubt as to his securing , without an ' opposing voice , the nomination . " Passing from President Barclay , the Liberian Register remarks that Vice-President Dossen , who was one of the commissioners to this country in 1908 , will probably be brought forward . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his boots , impressive and fluent in his speech . And we may say he is not without some of the qualifications that would make a good President . " That is surely no undue hero-worship . But the Vice-President has signed his own political death-warrant . " It can not be said that Mr. Dossen is quite as popular now as he was when on the Supreme Court bench . He seems to forget - that bills which he may introduce or favor in the Senate can not be necessarily accepted as were his decisions delivered from the bench . " The Secretary of State declines to permit the use of his name at the Presidential nominating convention in January because of his preference for a post which makes him the adviser of all Presidents . This leaves only the Secretary of the Treasury But he seems thoroughly fit for the place " Mr. Howard is popular . His popularity is of the Rooseveltian sort . He is affable , yet positive Consistency with him is a virtue " That makes it look , at any rate from this distance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
