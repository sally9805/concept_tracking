txt CLAIMS FOR WAR LOSS . No Enthusiasm for Plan for Washington to Pay Them . To the Editor of The New York Times : American merchants who sustained losses arising from the destruction of their ships by the German submarines are to be assured of compensation THE TIMES stated recently , thus : " The understanding has been that the United States Government would waive all rights to compensation by direct payment from the German Government through the Reparations Commission provided for in the Versailles Treaty if it received a legal title to the ships and other property seized and now in its possession . Under this arrangement the United States Government would compensate the American citizens who established their claims for losses sustained at the hands of the German Government , the ships and other properties being retained by this Government . " This was the method followed in the case of the French spoliation claims . Several ships belonging to my grandfather , Roger Sherman , 2d , and Benjamin Prescott , doing business in New Haven , Conn. , under the firm name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1799 , and the United States Government received their value from France and has it yet . This Government refused to return the money , although its own court has decided it should , and up to 1911 , when I last looked up the matter , fifty-nine favorable reports had been made to the Congress of the United States regarding these claims . Senator Gallinger of New Hampshire at that time stated that some of the most eminent lawyers and greatest statesmen the country has produced covering a period almost from the time that these claims were fresh up to the ( then ) present monent had also made favorable reports , and he mentioned Rufus Choate , Daniel Webster , Edward Everett , Chief Justice Marshall , and others , and he added : " If there was a law which would apply to the Government of the United States for withholding honest debts to the people of the United States the Government would be in jail all the time , and that is a fact " He also cited this incident : " The only claim that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sum of $750 . The Government owed it just as much us the Senator would owe me if he made a purchase from me and I did not deceive him . Yet it took that poor man ten years to get that claim reported favorably and passed by the Congress of the United States , and the day it passed he died ity the City of Washington and was buried by charity . " unless a citizen with an established German loss claim Is given the right to levy on the White House furniture or the fund for payment of the salaries of the Senators and Representatives he may as well kiss his claim good-bye . A. OUTRAM SHERMAN . New York , Nov. 28 , 1919 . Impossible Reservations . To ths Editor of ' 2716 NOW York Times : The Lodge reservations as at present drawn , it is fairly clear , were not constructed with the beet of intentions for the league covenant ; they go out of their way to insult our former Allies ; they complicate , rather than clear the situation . Put this Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reservations are necessary ; at most , purely Interpretative reservations would suffice . But the will of the people is that the United States adhere to the league  --  and It remains for the Senators to heed that all-powerful demand . LIONM GOLUBOWSKI . New York , Dec. 1 , 1919.
