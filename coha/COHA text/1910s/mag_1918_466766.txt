THE artillery is the last dashing phase of the war game . For the cavalry and the infantry the ? lan of old-time ) combat has passed , but the glory of Mars still lingers with the guns . He is a slow and timorous spirit indeed who does not feel a quickening of the pulse as lie beholds a battery of horse artillery going by at the gallop , With steeds that neither gods nor man can hold And screams that drive your innards cold . War in the front-line trenches to-day is less glorious than a slaughter-house in Chicago . But to stand in the darkness of the night behind a battery , listening to the sighing of the winds and the rustling of the trees , then out of silence to hear a voice , imperious and sharp , ring out , " Battery , fire ! " and to see the lightnings leap and feel the earth reverberate , is a memorable experience . It is as though one had heard and seen the mighty Jove let loose the thunders . For the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the front line , there is little of splendor in modern war . But back with the guns , to hear a quiet voice directing fire , and to look out as from a height upon the storm , to behold far and wide across the night that white and iridescent line where star-shells flame and Vere rockets flash , where red signals of distress call out through bursting clouds of shrapnel ? to see and hear all this is to feel the thrill of battle . That trail of iridescent white is leaping hell for the men who hold the trenches , but for the gunners who loosen the lightnings it is still replete with the splendor of war . Lord Nelson at the battle of Copenhagen , when the mast was splinVor .. CXXXVI ? Itiu. tered beside him , said , " We may be dead in a minute , but T would n't he elsewhere for thousands . " This is the feeling at the guns , where , over death and chaos , the voice of man still holds the mastery . To an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks for him . In the rage of battle the voice of the guns is the voice of rage for the men who serve them . For two years I moved up and clown the various portions of our line in France , ever learning more of our beastly foe , until the knowledge of their atroci-ties produced in my soul not a mere spirit of opposition but a flaming passion . On the fifteenth day of September , 1916 , it was n't somebody else 's quarrel ; it was my own fight . With me were a group of the old First Canadian Artillery drivers , every single one of whom had a personal hatred in his soul for the Huns . We were moving up with ammunition for our greatest bombardment on the Somme . Imagine , then , the music to our ears as we tore over the last crest and heard the unbroken voice of a thousand guns speaking down Sausage Valley . It was four o'clock in the morning , and pitch dark , but the long valley itself was one continual stream of leaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , and every gun was firing at white heat . At first far away , like distant surf , I heard the bombardment . But as T came over the top of each successive hill the sound grew louder , and as I rode my horse over the last crest and Sausage Valley burst out before me it seemed that the whirlwinds of thunder would sweep me from my saddle . For a moment I was dazed by the awful shock of noises . Then the meaning of it all flashed upon me , and I was happy ? a creature of the very storm itself . This was England 's answer to the Hun , our voice to the Beast . From the smoking chimneys of our arsenals to the reeking mouths of our guns we had one spirit , and now down Sausage Valley with an unbroken voice that spirit spoke . The rapid - fire 18 pounders were massed with quick staccato ; 6o-pounders spoke with the crack of a giant whiplash ; 9.2- and tz-inch howitzers bayed like bloodhounds from hell ; while the naval guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Altogether , blended in one voice , this was our challenge to the German Song of Hate . The picture of Sausage Valley on the Somme , as it stretched out before me that morning , was my most splendid spectacle of all this war ; it was a spectacle of the glory of the guns . Few realize that modern artillery in the field still thrills with war 's romance . It is the aim of this article to show something of that dashing side of war , and to convey some idea of the day 's work for the servants of the guns . There are three different branches of artillery ? light , siege , and heavy . With the light guns one sees the most adventure , for it is fullest of danger and dash . The siege artillery includes the howitzers above the 4.5 . The 4.5 is included in the light artillery . The difference between a howitzer and an ordinary field-gun is that the howitzer may he fired at a higher angle , and the charge may be lessened so as to cause a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against intrenchments and redoubts with strong overhead protection . When a field-gun with a maximum charge would pierce through , a howitzer bursts in from the top . It is therefore an ideal gun against intrenchments and overhead defenses . The heavy artillery is made up of the long-range naval guns of heavy caliber . They are used to take on distant targets far behind the enemy 's lines . I saw a battery of 6-inch naval guns in action one day near Albert ; or , to he more exact , I felt them in action . I was riding my horse in front of the battery , and did not notice the long barrels pointing high into the air until there came a report with a whir over my head , and aconcussion that nearly laid me on the ground . For a moment I strained my ear to the whir of the shell , and in imagination I followed the great projectile , until it crashed into some peaceful headquarters town far behind the Boche trenches , perhaps causing consternation to a German general and his staff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordnance people , who esteemed themselves miles outside of danger . We call the shells fired by the great naval guns " Silent Lizzies , " because they pass with such high velocity that one hardly hears them in their flight . Like a bolt from the blue , in places where folks preen themselves on their immunity from shell-fire , the Silent Lizzie may burst with sudden and awful havoc . We talk a good deal about the 15-inch guns along the line , but we never see them and they are rarely heard . They are moved up and down on a railroad , and are situated so far behind as to be the envy of all the men on the front line . One often hears those who are sick of the trenches declare , " In the next war I 'm going to join the 15-inch guns . " In the Ypres salient last year , whenever the Germans bombarded the town of Poperinghe , as was their habit , we always got busy with our r 5-inch naval gun in reply . This is-inch gun was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trenches . A few shots from our Silent Lizzie always caused Fritz to cease bombarding Poperinghe , bearing witness to the accuracy of our long-distance ranging . Fritz , by his sudden ceasing of fire , mutely implored , " Please do n't fire any more of those awful things at my general , and I wo n't fire any more at the women in Poperinghe . " With a battery in action there are three distinct zones of operation : First , the Ammunition Column ; second , the Guns ; third , the Observation Post . THE AMMUNITION COLUMN The supply of ammunition to the guns is a task of crucial importance . The Issues of battle depend as much on the proper supply of shells as upon the skilful handling of the guns . The ammunition comes up from the seaboard base by train . It is delivered at the rail head of the army to motor-lorries , by which it is conveyed to the ammunition-dump , situated on the fringes of the zone of shell tire . From the ammunition-dump the shells are delivered direct to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the light artillery keep up their supply by means of horse transport . Before a big battle an unmistakable evidence of the coming storm is the road blocked with ammunition limbers moving in one continuous stream toward the guns . When a field battery is situated far forward in a position of difficult approach , all kinds of obstacles have to be overcome to get there . Sometimes the ground is so had in wet weather that it is impossible to take limbers through , as they become mired on the way . On such occasions the shells are taken through by pack-saddle . Sleds are sometimes used over the mud . Trench tramways also serve as an expedient . If a battery is situated in a position the approaches to which are under observation of the enemy , the hauling of ammunition must be done at night . Moving across an unknown country in the inky blackness , where the roads are obliterated and the ground pocked with shell-holes , with a long column of horses and limbers , is a baffling task for the officer in charge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush ammunition through to the guns in daylight under observation . A veritable Balaclava charge ensues , with the wreckage of horses and limbers and gallant drivers strewn along the way . In a place known as Death Valley , on the Somme last fall , the artillery drivers on several occasions made a grueling hell-for-leather charge in the face of the enemy 's guns that equaled that of the Light Brigade . AT THE GUNS The guns are generally situated a mile or less behind the trenches . The heavy guns are often at a greater distance . One of the most important things in a good gun position is concealment . Woods and groves of trees always makeideal hiding-places for batteries . Sometimes they are in the open , behind a crest . A trellis-work of wire covered with leaves is often erected for overhead concealment from aeroplanes . Batteries of howitzers , with high-angle fire , may be situated in all kinds of unlikely places , as there is no trouble for them in clearing the crest . I saw a battery of howitzers in a farm-yard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position they were practically immune from observation . When in action they would merely shoot over the roof of the barn . The pour barn had been shelled over so much that it required the reinforcement of many steel rails to prevent it from collapsing . The greatest precaution must be taken at the guns to prevent the enemy from observing their position . The science of concealment is now a fine art . One could pass over a country bristling with guns and never dream that there was a battery in the vicinity until , without any warning , they start to pop off in every direction . Such sudden surprises are most disconcerting to one who is not acquainted in that region , as he does not know whether he is in front of or behind the wicked creatures . Flash screens made of canvas are erected at a distance in front of the guns to conceal their flash from the enemy at night . The sight of an aeroplane over a battery position causes immediate cessation of all movement . From a funk hole one watches the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battery it means a living hell for the gunners . Being shelled out of a battery is a distressing experience . The enemy 's guns are registered accurately on the battery position by aeroplane . One may hear the whir of a few shells , never dreaming that they are scientifically searching for him . When the registration has been accurately completed an exact record of the ranges and deflections is kept . Some quiet night the doomed battery awakens in terror to realize the fact that its fate is sealed . ' The lines of tire are laid out by an officer from a map by a system of trian- gulation . A fixed aiming-point is picked out on the base line , and all orders are given as so many degrees right or left of the aiming-point . During the hours of darkness a night light is hung in front of the guns , to serve the same function as the aiming-point by day . In registering the guns by aeroplane , the observer flies to a position from which he can command a view of the target , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position of readiness for observation . The wireless on the ground answers , " No . I gun firing , " and a few seconds later the officer in the aeroplane observes the burst of No . I shell . He orders the corrections according to a prearranged dock system , and thus finally directs the gun on to the target . I have seen a gun being registered by aeroplane make the target on the third shot , which is fine registering . The daily round at the guns on quiet seasons is rather monotonous . There must not be any excessive movement , for fear of disclosing the position , and in the dark gun-pits and holes in the ground the hours drag heavily . In the front line there is an air of expectancy , but at the guns one misses this . I always enjoyed the days I spent in the front trenches as forward observing officer , looking forward to them as a relief from the monotony of life at the guns . The orderly officer of the battery inspects the sights of each gun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are laid correctly on the S.O.S. targets , ready for any emergency . When not in action the gunners are generally busy keeping gun-nits and dugouts in condition , erecting new or stronger overhead protection , perfecting concealment , or adding to their domestic comfort . It is wonderful what labor and inventiveness will accomplish when it sets itself to making " a happy home " underground . There are many different tasks assigned to the guns in the day 's work . In the morning they may have a job cutting i wire for the infantry , who are going over for a raid or an attack . They may be called upon to retaliate on certain vulnerable positions of the enemy in reply to a strafe which he is giving our infantry . If a barrage , or curtain of fire , is being kept up on enemy 's hack roads , to prevent the bringing up of supplies or ammunition , one battery may take on the job at schedule time , to be relieved again by another battery later on . This continual keeping up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place off from all outside communication . In the town of Comb/es last fall we found the Huns starved to death in the streets , no rations having been able to penetrate our barrage for days . The bomb ardmentis a time of intense excitement and activity at the guns . A 4.5 howitzer battery , to which I was attached in the Ypres salient in 1916 , fired three thousand rounds between 7 A.M. and the following 1.3o A.M. This was at the time that the Canadians retook Sanctuary Wood , which they had lost a short time before . The major was called out at night for a conference at group headquarters ; on returning he announced , " We 've got a stiff day ahead to-morrow ; three thousand rounds is our assignment . " The continual shock and roar of the guns during such a bombardment is a terrific strain on the nervous system . At one o'clock that night we opened up an intense bombardment of every gun in the Ypres salient . From the 18-pounders to " Old Grandmother , " away back on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last five minutes of a time like this the officer 's nerves are strained as taut as a violin string . With trembling hand he examines his watch , apprehensive of every last second . To fire overtime would be to kill our own infantry . At one-thirty sharp the cry of " Stop ! " rings out , and a silence almost as distressing as the previous roar ensues . We know that in that grim silence our infantry , far up under the star-shells , are going " over the top . " Sentries are mounted at the battery every night to keep a continual watch of the front line for the S.O.S. signal , which is the cry for help from the trenches . From time to time during the night the sentries are relieved , but those on duty always have their eyes fixed on that zone which comes under the protection of our guns . Out of the darkness suddenly a long trail of blue and crimson light may shoot up into the night , bursting above into a crimson spray . At this signal the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battery , awakening the gunners , who come tumbling out of their dugouts and rush for the gun-pits . Sergeant " Hellfire " MacDougal of our battery , who commanded No. t gun crew , was always in his element in times like this . He would come leaping out of a sound sleep and lash his gun crew into action with astounding rapidity . From down in the darkened gun-pit would come a stream of fervid language as " Hellfire " put the lightning in the heels of his crew . The guns are laid on permanent S.O.S. targets , and it is only a matter of a few minutes until they can be fired in answer to the S.O.S. But every second counts ; perhaps a mine has been sprung , or a front line has been penetrated by a surprise attack , and the complete success of the enemy can only be prevented by the instantaneous action of the guns . Down in the gun-pits the gunners work like furies at their task . Nothing /0 could excel the rapidity and precision with which each man goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine , the fuse is set , shell is rammed home , the charge prepared and placed in the breech , the breech-block jammed , and the layer sings out " Ready ! " " Fire ! " orders the No. 1 , and the gun-pit shakes to the reverberations and a long tongue of forked lightning shoots out of the gun-pit . As the gun runs up from the recoil the No. 2 opens the breech-block , and a great rush of lurid backfire leaps from the breech , disclosing for a moment an uncanny picture of seven men who make up the gun crew , stripped to the waist and working for dear life . Sergeant " Hellfire " MacDougal used to make it his boast that he could always get his gun fired before any other in the salient . He generally made good his boast , but the rivalry was keen . Five minutes after the S.O.S. signal sent its cry through the night a thousand guns might be answering to its call . The effect of such a sudden outburst is most inspiriting to the fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing by our battery when the lid was thus suddenly blown off of hell , yell in an ecstasy of delight : " That 's the idea , bo ! Soak it to ' em ? hit ' em one for me ! " " Hellfire " MacDougal was addicted to the habit of chewing tobacco . Black Napoleon was his favorite brand . He would bite off a great chunk of Honey Dew , spit with a report like a Maxim , and then send a leaping , blood-curdling oath at his gun crew . I believe that " Hellfire " was descended from the buccaneers . His forebears most have dwelt on the Spanish Main . He , at least , was much indebted to the Kaiser for starting the war , for , as he put it , he was having an unusually good time out of it , and of course he could never be killed . As he expressed it , " They ' ai n't made the bullet yet that ' 11 get mc . " On one occasion an armor-piercing shell burst through his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in action at the time and every man was blown to pieces . " Hellfire " at the moment was having a little target practice of his own , with a squirt of tobacco juice , just outside the gun-pit , and went untouched . " That 's what comes from usin ' Black Napoleon , boys ! " he announced , nonchalantly , when one referred to his miraculous escape . THE OBSERVATION POST Indirect fire is the general method in this war . That is , firing at an unseen target by means of a fixed aiming-point , the fire itself being directed by a forward observing officer , known as the F. 0 . 0. , who , from some vantage-point in advance , observes the burst of our shells and wires the correction to the guns in the rear . The observation post may be situated in any convenient position that commands the enemy 's zone ? the steeple of a church , the top of a house or a barn , a lofty tree , a high cliff , or a shell crater , may serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called . The 0 . P. is always a dangerous place , as the enemy 's guns are continually searching the opposite side for points likely to serve for observation . Early in the war , when artillery officers got together , one heard of wild experiences in precarious 0 . P. 's , most of which have long since been shot to kindling-wood . On one occasion an artillery officer had just ensconced himself in a lofty steeple , which had been all but shot away , when the enemy opened fire on the steeple again . Before the observer could make good his retreat , the enemy registered a direct hit on the tottering structure and the whole thing crashed to earth , smashing the unfortunate gunner to death and burying him in heaps of debris . Among the commonest places for an O. P. is the upper story of an old house or barn . These lonely buildings , often all that remains on a razed and shattered landscape , are the most deplorable places imaginable in which to spend the night . In the long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other days were ever running riot through the place . We had an O. P. once in a place known as " The Flaunted Chateau . " It was situated on a high hill , surrounded by a grove of trees which were stripped bare from shell-fire . Through the bare wood the wind would moan at night like a lost soul , while the rafters of the place would creak , and from the vaulted cellars imagination seemed to catch all kinds of voices . have heard Signaler Muldooncy , during his lonely watch , cry out as though in pain from the horror of that place at night . Signaler Muldooney would go through a curtain of fire without batting an eye , but " The Haunted Chateau " was too much for his nerves . The attic of " The Haunted Chateau " afforded a splendid Observation Post . Below , everything had been smashed to pieces . Careful hands had gently nursed that rickety attic , and new beams and piles of sand-bags had kept it from crashing down , though , as Muldooney put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blew . " From the topgallant window of this precarious structure a perfect view of the enemy lines could he obtained . Only the concealment of the wood had saved the chateau from being pulverized long ago . Fritz , however , suspicious of the wood , had a bad habit of suddenly popping off a few rounds in that direction . At such times the rickety attic was a most unpopular place . To fire the battery from the 0 . P. the F. 0 . 0 . would first get his telescope on the target , and then call out , " Ready ! " which the telephonist would repeat over the phone . From far down at the guns would come back the warning , " N gun firing , " and a moment later the F. 0 . 0 . would observe the shell burst , perhaps a little short and too much to the left ; so he would call out , " Ten minutes more left -- add fifty ! " meaning that the gun would be deflected ten minutes more left from the aiming-point , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next was not on , he would make another correction , and continue in this manner until the shell hit the target . This is called registering a battery . Sometimes the O. P. is situated in the front line , as often in the flat country of Flanders there is no vantage-point in the rear . The observing officer goes forward for a two days ' stunt in the front line , taking with him a party of signalers and linemen . On arriving in the trenches , the F. 0 . 0 . reports to the battalion commander at the headquarters dugout , situated in the support trenches . While in the front line it is the duty of the F. 0 . 0 . to keep the guns in touch with the infantry . The battalion commander may call upon him at any time for retaliation , or to shoot up any new target that may present itself . After leaving the battalion headquarters , the F. 0 . 0 . relieves the officer who has been on duty the past two days , who hands over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front line for the past forty-eight hours : The gunner officer in the front line is not merely there to observe for his guns ; he is also to gather all possible intelligence pertaining to his own zone . A record is kept of all hostile fire observed , by which it is determined whether the enemy 's artillery is weak or strong at the time in that particular zone . In his intelligence duties the F. 0 . O. is the newspaper reporter of the front line . With periscope and compass , followed by a trusty signaler , he moves along the bays of the fire-trench in his quest for news . Three balloons are observed and he takes the bearings of them with his magnetic compass . Next he WITH THE GUNS 255 makes note of an aeroplane crossing the line , flying low . Seeing a group eagerly peering at a looking-glass attached to the end of a bayonet , which serves as a periscope , he inquires , " Anything doin ' here , boys ? " " Yes , sir , " answers a sergeant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrees left of the bare tree . The artillery officer turns his own periscope , which magnifies ten diameters , on the object named , and whistles to himself . " Yes , you 're onto something , all right . Sergeant , " he exclaims . " That 's what we call the major 's dugout , which we shot up some time ago , and now they 've built it up again , only a little lower . But we 'll shoot it up again to-night with our howitzers . I think it 's a machine-gun emplacement . " A little farther along he observes a great rent in the Boche parapet . This I its the work of our trench-mortars , which have been having a little strafe of their own . A sentry in another bay shows him a fuse which he has found . The gunner recognizes the fuse as coming from a certain high-velocity shell , and makes a note of a new gun on his front . At night all the various items gathered together by the F. 0 . 0 . are written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the following day they appear in the war zone newspaper , known as The Corps Intelligence Summary . Under the heading , " Information from Our Own Front . I ? Enemy 's Front and Support Lines , " the trench reporter reads his news gathered the day before . The Intelligence Summary is regarded by some as a weighty production , but Tommy , in fine contempt , calls it " Comic Cuts . " But , despite the irreverence of Tommy , this sheet contains the ultimate war news , and the unknown cub reporters on that front line Street of Adventure are daily recording history that sometime ponderous professors will sift out with weighty comment . In time of battle the F. 0 . 0. , if he is not observing in the front line , is generally at battalion headquarters giving every latest happening to the anxious ears at the guns . Into the battalion headquarters , as into a whispering gal-lery , come the rumors from all parts of the trenches : " Our guns are shooting short " ? " Enemy are coming over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-seven " - - " Trench-mortars are crumping in parapet of thirty-five "  - -  all these items arc passed back immediately to the guns , and determine their policy in the battle . Keeping up communication during a bombardment is a most difficult and dangerous task . Sometimes the lines arc broken in several places by shell-fire . Instantly that communication is broken linemen are despatched to mend the wires . They move nut simultaneously from both ends , following along the line until they discover the break and mend it . To move out across a field where death is falling like leaves in an autumn forest requires the finest kind of pluck , but the signalers never seem to fail . " Hearn , the wires are down ! " exclaims the officer who has been for a minute fruitlessly fingering the telegraph-key . " Very good , sir , " answers the faithful Hearn , and immediately leaves the protection of the deep dugout and begins to run along the trench , with shells clumping in every direction . Some time passes . Hearn does not return and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hearn has gone down ; you carry on his place , " is the next order . " Very good , sir , " answers Mitchell , and without a question goes out into the storm of bursting shrapnel . Sometimes one lineman after another is despatched , and all fail to return . But at all costs communication must be re-established . There are no braver men in the war than the artillery signalers , and none who make a greater sacrifice in the path of duty . During three months in the Somme last fall our battery had its signalers completely wiped out three times in succession . It got so that I never expected to meet one of the old-timers after the second or third trip . " Where is Mac ? " one would inquire , missing an old face . " Oh , he went west last week , " would be the answer . When we are attacking , the forward observing officer goes over the top just like the rest . He generally goes with the second wave , which also includes the colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No Man 's Land , the F. 0 . 0 . and his signalers make for a prearranged point in the enemy 's line which is to serve as the new advanced 0 . P. As the artillery party crosses No Man 's Land , a field telephone is carried with them and a wire is run out connecting them with the guns . If the first F. 0 . 0 . goes down , word comes back to the reserve officers waiting in front-line dugouts , and a second steps forth to fill the place of him who has fallen . Some-tunes before the attack is over the third or fourth may be called out to fill the gap . It is the duty of the F. 0 . 0 . during an attack to keep the guns informed as to the position of our advancing infantry ? as to what objectives have been gained , how we are holding , where we are losing , and if any guns are firing short . One sees bloody sights on first entering the front-line trenches , where the mopping-up battalions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here is always shifting , and what is ours now , within an hour may be in the en-emy 's hands again . Everything is uncertain , and our line is always chang ing . One F. 0 . 0. , who had advanced with the farthest wave , established himself in a Boche dugout and was busily engaged in studying his map when he heard bombs explode in the next dugout , oc copied by his signalers . Rushing to the entrance of his dugout , the officer was startled to see the hacks of three Germans , who were engaged in bombing his signalers next door . With a quick draw of his Colt-45 , he despatched the three Huns through the hack , and , leaping out , found the trench entirely abandoned by our troops , they having retired without giving the artillery officer warning . All his signalers were killed . Needless to relate , Arthur Duffy had nothing on that F. 0 . 0 . for speed when he once started to retire . The artillery still thrills with high adventure ? in the precarious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouths of the guns , or with the ammunition limbers thundering around Suicide Corner or tearing down Death Valley ? in all its phases it still presents the colors of romance , against the otherwise somber background of modern war .
