txt We are clearly Of the opinion that there should be a substantial advance now , provided that such additional revenue can be obtained without Imposing upon the public unjust and unreasonable transportation charges , and provided further that some assurance can be given that the money will be prudently expended in the public interest . " This is the declaration of the conference of Railroad Commissioners upon the proposition of the Boston and Maine Railroad to increase Its rates . The report of the conference was made public to-night by the Public Service Commission . " Counsel for the company , " says the report , " claimed that such increase should amount to at least $5,000,000 per year . To this we do not assent . It can not be known until the property is once more efficiently and properly operated and until its leasehold lines have been valued how much the advance should be . " The commissioners also say that past mismanagement is responsible for much of the road 's present difficulty . The conferees who signed the report were Charles A. Prouty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and George W. Anderson , George W. Bishop , Clinton White , and Edward E. Stone of the Massachusetts Public Service Commission ; Robert C. Bacon , Chairman , and William R. Warner and Park H. Pollock of the Vermont Public Service Commission ; Edward C. Niles , Chairman , and John E. Benton and Thomas W. D. Worthen of " the New Hampshire Public Service Commissidn , and Elmer P. Spofford , Chairman , and Frank Keizer and John A. Jones of the Maine Railroad Commission . The Commissioners representing the four Northern New England States through which the Boston &; Maine operates conferred with Interstate Commerce Commissioner Prouty In order that niformity of opinion and action might oe established between the Federal board and the various State boards . The Interstate Commerce Commission has no authority to approve in advance a schedule of rates , and can not therefore permit an advance . The railroad must first file its schedule , which will then be examined and corrected by the commission . The report of the Commissioners Ilse , therefore , no official standing , but merely reflects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing for the railroad to do . Running Behind Badly . After reviewing the reasons leading to the conference of the Commissioners , the report says : The Boston &; Maine Railroad , upon the basis of its present rates , is bankrupt . For the year ended June 30 , 1913 , it had remaining after the pay-. ment of Its fixed charges and its taxes $49,000 . In point of fact , dividends aggregating 3 per cent upon the capital stock were paid during the year , but they were not earned . Comparing July . August , and September of the present year ? with the corresponding months for the year 1912 , we find a decrease in net operating revenue of $681,000 . From an analysis of its operating expenses for the year 1913 , as compared with other years upon the Boston &; Maine and with other railroads , and as compared with the first three months of the current Year , it seems probable that its income from operation will fall at least $1 , - 000,000 short of what it was in the Year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this income will be materially increased during the current year as compared with the previous like period . Owing to an advance in the rate of interest , the , interest charges will be increased approximately $600,000 . Owing to an Increase In the per diem charge for the use of freight cars , the item for hire of equipment , if the same amount of business is transacted. and it no greater car efficiency can be secured , will be approximately $400.000 larger . It now appears probable that for the year 1914 the road will lack , if no increase in rates is allowed , $2,000,000 of sufficient income to pay its taxes , its interest , and its fixed charges . without the payment of any dividend upon its capital stock . Tale deplorable showing is in part due to the mismanagement of the company . Tha Boston &; Maine has outstanding $27,000,000 of short-time paper , which it will carry for the current year at a charge of about 71/2 per cent. , as compared with Sy per cent , for the preceding year . Of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston &; Maine now owns . Assuming that these stocks may finally be worth the price paid , which is doubtful , their purchase at the  --  time was utterly unnecessary and ill-advised , and the consequences of those transactions ought not to be visited upon the rate-paying public . New Haven Control Disastrous . The attempt of the New York , New Haven &; Hartford Railroad Company to acquire a control of the Boston &; Maine system and combine that system in operation with its own proved disastrous , and the effect is still obvious in the operating cost of the Boston &; Maine Company . Operating cost has been increased and net income diminished by a number of circumstances , chief of which were increased wages and per diem freight car charges , the report says . After agreeing that some increase in rates should be allowed , the conferees say that it is a perplexing question how this increase shall be effected , but that It appears that the additional revenue must come in the main from freight traffic . The Commissioners believe it inadvisable to increase long-distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New England manufacturers without increasing the costs to competitors in other parts of the country . The Commissioners hold that clam ' and commodity local rates on the Boston &; Maine ought to be dealt with first . The railroad company proposed to apply a uniform mileage scale of class rates on all parts of its system , but this plan was rejected by the Commissioners because It ignored traffic density and other differences in operating costs . " Instead , " continues the report , " we have divided the Boston &; Maine into two classes . Class A embraces the following : Main lines between Boston and Portland , main line between Boston and Concord . N. H. : entire main line of the Fitchburg . Cheshire and Troy branches of the Fitchburg , main line between Springfield , Mass. , and Windsor , Vt. ; main line from Worcester to Nashua , Stony Brook Branch . Saugus Branch , Lexington Branch , Watertown Branch , and Medford Branch . Class B includes all other lines of the system . " We have approved the railroad maximum schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 2-3 per cent . higher should be applied on Class B lines , and that between points on Class A lines aed Class C lines a constructive mileage should be made up by adding together the actual mileage on the Class A line and the actual mileage on the Class B line , plus 25 per cent . of Class B distance , and that to this constructive mileage the Class A scale should he applied . " The scales thus approved differ radically from that first presented by the railroad . While some increase In revenue will result to the carrier , our central thought has been to provide a system of local class rates which would remove the glaring discriminations between individuals and localities which now exist , and pave the way for a proper revision of the commodity rates of that company . " Pussenaer Rate inequalities . Referring to a proposal to Increase Passenger rates , the Commissioners say that two of the States served by the Boston &; Maine require that mileage hooks be sold on the basis of 2 cents a mile and add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2 cents per mile , and local fares were adjusted at a minimum of Me cents and a maximum of 2% cents per mile , the relation between the mileage book and the present fare would be a more just one than now exists . We are ail of the opinion that these passenger fares require readjustment and that the statutes of those States which might interfere with a uniform treatment of this subject should be so modified that , if possible , some just rule applicable to all territory may be formulated . Assuming that the same number of mileage books were sold as at present , an Increase of one-fourth of a cent a mile would yield additional revenue of approximately $500,000 per year . Clearly , no increase in rates should be allowed until it is made reasonably certain that the revenues of this company will be prudently expended In the public interest . Mr. Elliott , the chief executive of the New Haven Company . which is the owner of a majority of the stork of the Boston &; Maine , and Mr. the newly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both called before the conference and were asked what assurance could be given for the future . They both replied . in substance , that they could only say that so long as they were identified with the management of these New England railroads. their best effort would be employed to secure a satisfactory and efficient operation . While this is all that those gentlemen , as individuals , can say at the present time . it is not wholly satisfactory . The Directors of these railroad corporations are both in law and in feet the scource of all authority . They ought at least to know whether the results . ehteined by their anpointees are . ' satigrietory . Now , while there have been some Individual changes in these Boards of Directors , the majority of the membership is the same to-day that It was a year ago . Call for New Directorates . This IS not reassuring for the future . If these gentlemen have in recent times given any actual attention to the management of these properties , their failure to ace and to do is evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If , upon the other hand , being vested with the duty of management , they have utterly neglected that duty and known nothing about the operations of these companies , that fact is even clearer evidence of their unfitness for these positions . If the stockholders of these companies would present to the people of New England a radically changed Directorate this would go far toward satisfying the public that some substantial reform was contemplated , or at least that the Directors would know what was happening . Certain changes have already been made in the management of the Buston &; Maine system which are in out opinion in the right direction . The operation of that property has been entirely divorced from that of the New Haven Company , Mr. , formerly chief executive of the Maine Central , has been elected President andput In charge of the property . The long service of this irentleman upon the Maine Central and his success in that field inspire confidence in his selection , and there is reason to believe that If he can receive proper support he may do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One thing In connection with his employment we are inclined to criticise . It appears that he Is ? still Identified with the Maine Central system and draws a substantial salary from that company for his services . The Roston &; Maine Days Mr. $35jele a year and the Maine Central pays him another ** making in all $50 ; 000 . One Job For . We think $354100 is liberal compensation to the President of the Boston &; Maine Railroad . But whatever sal ? ary Mr. Is to receive should In our opinion be Laid by the Boston &; Maine alone , and that company should have the . benefit of his entire time and energy . What we have said as to the eatery of the President is not In criticism of Mr. hut rather of this modern custom , of which he is at once the beneficiary and the We are also of the opinion that the traffic departments of the Boston &; Maine and tho New Leaven shook ' finally be entirely separated . The present financial condition of the Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what should he done to protect the Just interests of all concerned . It may finally turn out that these properties should he thrown into the hands of a receiver , and pass through a process of reorganizaton. but this would be a calamity which ought to be avoided if possible . The present condition was years In forming , and will require years in the correction . If disaster is to be avoided , all Interested parties must exercise forbearance and must undergo temporary Inconvenience . IllatrIbutIon of the Darden . The stockholders of the Boston &; Maine can not reasonably expect to receive further dividends in the immediate future . Tile financiers who are carrying the short-time paper might well abate something from their present demands . The owners of the leased properties might well accept something less than the full rent reserved for the next two or three years , The pubic mil. ? expect to sustain Borne part of the burden . It should not be taxed for . the mismanagement of this property , but It ' should remember that the cost of furnishing the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled to a fair return The Vermont members of the conference believed the one-scale plan of rates to be the only consistent and fair one , but acceded to the plan adopted for the sake of securing uniform action The Maine Commissioners dissent from the suggestion that Mr. sever his connection with the Maine Central Railroad .
