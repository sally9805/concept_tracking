txt By modifying the 18% tax on undistributed profits of corporations so that that part of such profits used to liquidate interest-bearing indebtedness will pay only the 12% normal rate , the House Revenue bill framers have done something toward levelling out one important economic fault in the measure . The idea of a tax on undistributed income of corporations is not new . It was incorporated , at a 10% rate , in the 1917 revenue measure , and , in fact , has been contained in earlier measures . But the tax in these instances has been on undistributed profits not needed and employed in the business of the corporation . Such a tax had its justification in that it made it unprofitable for a privately or closely owned corporation with large profits to hold these in its treasury instead of paying them to stockholders , thus saving the latter the payment of heavy income surtaxes . Thus it is simply a stop-gap against evasion of taxes and economically is justifiable . On the other hand no experienced business man would contend that the average corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its profits in dividends at present , particularly in view of the high cost of raw materials and labor and the severe calls upon working capital of all companies . A tax upon all profits withheld from shareholders , no matter how badly needed in the business , or tied up in inventories , etc. , would almost certainly cause a demand from small stockholders for the greatest possible division of profits and might force the management to make distributions resulting later in seriously affecting the company 's financial position . The number of companies wrecked or seriously waterlogged by too liberal dividend payments , when cash resources should have been reserved , although earnings apparently justified disbursements to stockholders is too numerous to need aeeifie mention . Under the British law corporations pay a SO% income tax on all earnings , the tax being deducted at the source in the case of disbursements to shareholders . Large as this tax is , it does not contain any incentive to action which might be disastrous to the corporation . Secretary of the Treasury ** it Ls understood , wants a flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax on undivided earnings . when these are not needed in the business but are otherwise invested could , however , hardly be objected to .
