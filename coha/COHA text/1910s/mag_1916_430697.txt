 |p517  EVERYBODY , who thinks at all , knows exactly what happened when the war broke in July of 1914 . Ship sailings were cancelled . Stock exchanges closed . Cotton could not be sold at 4 cents a pound , and wheat was embargoed on rail sidings at Buffalo , New York , and Baltimore , so that the great grain exchanges of Chicago , Minneapolis , St. Paul , and Winnipeg wired to their country buyers to stop buying grain altogether . I happened to have as a guest in my home a veteran Board of Trade operator from Chicago . " Unless the sea lanes open , " he predicted , " you will see wheat down to 60 and 40 cents by Christmas . " Cotton operators and growers saw looming ahead of them the total loss of the year 's crop . At one fell swoop grain-growers saw wheat at prices that would not pay the cost of seeding and threshing ; for it now costs $7 an acre to seed and harvest wheat ; and when the price of thirty bushels to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough left to pay 1Ylan hire and team hire . For the first time in history , the Middle West realized , what does the sea matter to us ? For the first time in history , the Middle West sat up and asked ? What 's a merchant marine to us ? What 's a navy to us ? All the world knows the rest ? the flustered , frantic efforts to provide national funds to finance cotton , to buy freighters , to provide a federal merchant marine ? in a word , to lift ourselves by our bootstraps out of the commercial slough in which messy methods and blind bull-headedness had plunged our export trade . With huge cotton , corn , and wheat crops , prices dropped plumb to bottom . Why ? - Because the sea was closed , and we could n't ship the output . I had friends in the West with ten-thousand-bushel crops . Ruin seemed to be staring them in the face . Suddenly , something happened . Instead of selling at 40 cents , wheat moved up to $1 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels , while experts were still discussing how to avert ruin . What had happened ? The sea lanes had opened . Every sea lane all over the world was open wide , and safe . What had produced the miracle ? Sea power ? a great navy patrolling the lanes of the sea , and keeping the sea 's broad highway wide open . If the British Navy had not been powerful enough to do this , it is incon/ ceivable to what depths of depression American foreign trade would have fallen in the last two years . Pending the depression of the last half of 1914 , there were 350,000 idle men in New York City alone . There were literally millions of workers unemployed all through the country . Factories closed . Wheels stopped going round . Railroads ran on half- and quarter-time . To-day , factories are running on three time shifts . There is not an idle wheel in the United States , and there is hardy an unemployed person , who can work , from Atlantic to Pacific . Wages are the highest ever known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea lanes opened and permitted Uncle Sam to feed , clothe , and provision the warring world . When Colonel Thompson warned the Navy League at its convention last April that the sea was no longer a barrier against danger to the United States , but had become a broad highway , more easily traversed by a hostile power than the rail route from New York to Chicago , people turned the deprecating smile that men of affairs always reserve for the far-sighted visionary . Yet ? was it so very far-sighted after all ? Colonel Thompson uttered his warning last April . The submarine commerce-destroyer began operations off Nantucket in October ? six months from Colonel Thompson 's warning . One is really constrained to ask , is it far vision on the part of the Navy men , or short memory on the part of the American public ? Keeping those facts in mind , what happened to us in 1914 when the sea lanes closed , what happened in 1915 and ' 16 when the sea lanes opened , and what is impending now that the submarine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any American in his right senses can question the spendings on the American Navy . Yet the fear is prevalent that , before the building of Uncle Sam 's new navy is well under way , navy appropriations by future Congresses may be cut and curtailed in a way to obstruct Uncle Sam 's sea lanes out to the commerce of the world . Let us see what those spendings are . The total Navy and Army appropriation for 1916 was something over $685,000,000 , of which less than half was for the Navy ? the Navy that is our sentry and guard at this end of the sea lanes -- say $315,000,000 to $325,000,000 , perhaps a little more ; for the bill provides certain increases up to 20 per cent . to insure speed and efficiency . At a gambler 's outside limit , put the Navy figure at $350 , - 000,000 ; on the guardian who stands at our gates ; on the policeman who is to patrol our seas and protect our commerce ; on the magician , who insures good prices for the cotton-grower and the wheat-farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to patent pills ! Then look at the Navy spendings ! Which does the most for the nation ? Which does the most for the Middle West , and the Northwest , and the South ? for the wheat farm and the cotton plantation and the beef ranch and the sheep run ? Which does the most for you  |p519  and for me ? and I do n't care whether you live with your feet in the salt sea , or handle wool in the desert , 3000 miles from the Atlantic Coast line ? Just waken up and ask yourself the question ; and do n't go to sleep again till you answer it ! THE SHIPS OF THE NEW NAVY All the same , exactly what , and specifically what is Uncle Sam going to get in return for his big Navy Bill ? Exactly and specifically , first of all , he is to get under way before July , 1919 : 10 first-class battleships 6 battle-cruisers 10 scout-cruisers 50 destroyers 9 fleet submarines ( deep sea ) 53 coast submarines 13 auxiliary vessels , Of these , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyers , thirty coast " subs , " and several auxiliaries are to be begun within six months from August , 1916 ; and 20 per cent . above specified prices will be permitted to insure speed in construction and efficiency . If there be any saltsea pride left in our sluggish land blood , the proportions of these vessels should stir it . The battle-cruisers are to be 100 feet longer than the Woolworth building is high . Their displacement will be 35,000 tons , and they will have a speed of 35 knots . Also , they will each carry ten 14-inch guns . Being a landlubber , those figures do n't mean much more to you than they do to me . Let us put it in land terms ! All right-those cruisers will be able to carry as many seamen as the Woolworth houses tenants . They will travel as fast as the Century Express ; and their guns will be able to toss a little shell , weighing 1400 pounds , any trifling distance from eight to twelve miles . In fact , those guns will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they are ranged the longer distance , the smashing power will not be as great as at eight or ten miles . If you figure the cost of each shot at $1000 , and each of the ten guns fires two shots a minute , and the battle lasts , say two hours ? modern sea battles are terribly swift ? you can figure up a total cost for shells to make a peace-at-anyprice man have goose-flesh ; but when he has his worst shivers , figure again ! All the shells a battle-cruiser can fire will not compare to one day 's loss if the sea lanes are closed against our commerce . All the loss of life the battle-cruiser 's shells can cause can not compare to the death toll of poverty . and want when commerce stops , and the factory wheels cease to go round . If you doubt that , compare the deaths from want in Armenia to the deaths from shots in the Dar-danelles ! As to the tonnage of these modern leviathans , 35,000 tons displacement does n't mean much to a landsman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 35-ton freight-car is big . The battle-cruisers will weigh as much as 1000 such freight-cars , or fifty trains of such cars . A few years ago , we thought a million dollars a big capitalization . These battlecruisers will cost about $16,500,000 each , with $4,000,000 more for armor and armaments , and 20 per cent . excess for speed and efficient construction . It will surprise the layman to be told that the battleships will be 200 feet shorter than  |p520  the cruisers . The cruisers are longer , to give space for the machinery to insure speed ? also to permit sharper , speedier lines . The armor-belt will be eight inches thick , compared to the English cruisers ' nine inches thick . What the European governments have done in shipbuilding since the war began is an impenetrable secret ; but before the war , British cruisers had a speed of thirty knots , a displacement of 28,500 tons , and a length of 720 feet ; German cruisers had a speed of thirty knots , a displacement of 26,200 tons , and a length of 689 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a displacement of 27,500 tons , and a length of 680 feet . TREMENDOUS GUN-POWER Just here a lot of fine points come in naval construction that will interest the public more and more as naval development goes on . The cruiser is for speed ; the dreadnought for invulnerable smashing power . When armor-plating was invented , men said ? " here is an end to gun power " ; but along came the invention of bigger and bigger , and higher and higher velocity projectiles ; and it became a race between the development of the big gun and the development of armor-plate . When you can fire a projectile weighing 2700 pounds from an 18-inch gun ten or twelve miles at an initial velocity of , say 2700 feet a second , any armor-plating known to science is penetrated instantaneously . In the race the big gun won . So to evade the big gun , the next tendency is not to clog speed with overweighted armor-plate . Armor-plate will be thinner , speed greater . This is one of the great lessons of the present war ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beggar fancy . This simply means bigger and bigger guns with a fiercer propulsion . In the Russo-Japanese War battles were won with 850-pound projectiles thrown 6000 to 8000 yards . To-day , 1800-pound projectiles are hurled 10,000 to 20,000 yards ? the distance being chosen purely by the effectiveness of the smash at the target . That is , the range-finder , say an aeroplane or hydroplane , may locate the enemy at nineteen miles , and the projectile might find the target ; but at ten miles ? the usual extreme fighting range ? the smashing power would be irresistible . I am aware this is not the language in which an expert would put it ; but it is the language that is understandable to landlubbers like myself . I asked a Navy gun expert how the calibre of the guns varied with the weight of the projectiles . His answer was not a plain yea or nay , but guardedly , to the effect that the 14-inch gun would take care of 1400 pounds , the 16-inch gun of a ton , the 18-inch gun of 2700 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good 16-inch gun finding its target twenty-five miles away . Keep in mind that range is conditioned by effectiveness of the smashing power , and do you take in what such ranges imply ? Just think a second ! A hostile fleet could lie off New York , or Baltimore , or Boston fifteen miles , and drop 2700-pound projectiles into our coast cities that would knock down every building flat in twenty-four hours . I do not know what has been done in the United States since the war broke out ; but I do know that before the war there was not a coast gun in the United States that exceeded ten to twelve miles in range . REQUIREMENTS OF BATTLESHIPS AND CRUISERS Do you take in what that means ? It means a powerful enemy could come easily over the highways of the sea against us and knock us flat before we could get one blow back at him . That is what an adequate Navy means to Uncle Sam . That is what he is going to get out of his spendings ? a certainty against danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern naval  |p521  page deleted  |p522  Falklands , and saved the day for Beatty in the North Sea ; and it was the cruiser again that got into the thick of it off Jutland . The cruiser is as big as a battleship , but not so powerful . The cruisers will require 180,000 horsepower for their top speed of forty miles an hour . The engine-power of one battlecruiser would run the street-cars and lights for a city of half a million . SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CHANGE TO OIL FUEL One of the great changes in Navy construction is the use of oil instead of coal for fuel . This necessitates new naval bases and tank auxiliaries . Oil becomes the very food and drink of the Navy ; and in this fact lies one of the greatest dangers menacing Uncle Sam 's new Navy . Motors are exhausting oil supplies at an enormous rate . The world 's oil-fields are now known , mapped and tapped . Within the lifetime of this generation oil will be scarce . Where , then , is the new Navy of defense to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curse of an efficient Navy ? politics . The Government has segregated in Southern California oil-fields sufficient to supply the Navy 's needs . These are federal lands . But railroads also use oil . And the big motor companies covet oil ; and promoters and squatters and swindlers also have their eyes on those oil-fields . It does not lessen the danger to the Navy in the least that there is an underground pipe-line running from the squatters and promoters and swindlers up to Senators and Congressmen . The point is ? do the people of the United States want a Navy , for which in one year they are paying $315,000,000 , endangered by lack of fuel caused by oil-land flotation gentry ? Do the people of California ever realize why Japan is building a bigger and bigger navy ? Do the people of California depend on Uncle Sam 's Navy to keep the sea lanes of the Pacific open and safe ? Does California want the Jap , or Uncle Sam , to patrol Pacific lanes of trade ? What California wants she should express very plainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navy needs certain oil lands reserved . Does California want these reserved for the Navy ? If so , she should wake up ; for no part of the United States would suffer more from an enemy across the highways of the sea than California . Her cities are coast cities . Her wealth is beyond dreams . Her sovereignty is remote . California knows her danger , and should act in the oil-land contest . But here comes in another consideration . Ask great engineers like Henry Doherty , and they will tell you that science is solving the problem of oil and gasoline fuels . Henry Doherty declares it proved beyond question that the waste in byproducts of gas , oil , and coal distillation would run every battleship and motor in the world for a century . The problem of oil fuels is a product that will serve at moderate temperature ? I believe the scientific way to put it is , that will boil and distil at low temperatures . RELATIVE RANK OF WORLD NAVIES Granted we build the Navy as planned by Congress , where shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is hard to answer this question , for the Navy manuals preceding the war are obsolete . Germany , England , and Japan have been building feverishly , and secretly , for almost three years . Also , vessels which we have hitherto ranked as first fighting-line ships in the United States Navy can no longer be so regarded , except for Fourth of July school orations . No American Navy officer dare give out the facts ; but if you root around among experts , who know , you will find there are now many vessels , big and little , of Uncle Sam 's sea fighters which ought to be discarded as obsolete . Counting these out , the relative rank of the different world navies stands  |p523  page deleted  |p524  what Germany might have done to the United States in the Spanish War . The founders were Herbert Satterlee , the late Jarvis Edson , Allen Apgar , Charles Loring , Henry Eckford Rhoades , George Barton , Leonard Chenery ? in every case veterans of the Civil War , who had fought for their country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upbuilding of the Navy ? not a munition man among them . Such charges against patriots come with bad grace from alien propagandists . Every dollar put up was from personal pocketbooks , and the first year 's spendings did not exceed $500 . Gradually , publicspirited men came into the league , though men like Schwab , and Farrell , who probably know more about ordnance , and armor , and shipbuilding than all experts put together , refrained from active participation purely to avoid such charges . I think this a great loss to the League , and an unnecessary loss . It seems to me the services of such men would be invaluable in any National Council of Defense , and would be so utilized in any country where leather-lunged blatherskites do not make the welkin ring . Since 1903 , when formal organization was effected , the Navy League has grown to 300,000 members , and to-day has 1000 committee men and women , thirty-seven State committees , 13,000 active working members , 210,000 associate members . It would be hard to find any name of national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cardinal Gibbons , which is not on the roster of the Navy League . CIVILIAN CRUISES Two features of the Navy League work are bound to react in public support of the Navy ? the civilian cruises of midsummer , and the training of women in defense work . Last summer , 2000 civilians , of whom half were from the Middle West , took training in a vacation cruise . The civilian recruits were club men , athletes , college boys , professional men ; and it would take a professional pacifist to find out what harm came from a month in the open , under washed skies , where the richest fellows rubbed elbows with the poorest man , and both alike obeyed orders , from swabbing decks to tightening a careless shoe-lace . The charge was merely nominal ? $30 for board and clothes . This cruise was in midsummer , and plans are under consideration for cruises in which boys can participate who are too busy to go in summer . Such cruises are the best evangel of the Navy as a career for a boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand erect and use backbone instead of jawbone , and take the knocks that come in every-day life , elbow to elbow with the boy who has learned all that he knows from hard knocks ? there is no ground for the outcry about the brutalizing effect of military training . The " sissy " will have manhood knocked into him , and the little beast will have the beast  |p525  knocked out of him , and the skulking nonentity will at least learn to stand erect , a part of the scheme of things . Nor is there a ghost of ground for the foolish accusation that the snobbery of Navy life excludes the poor boy . The poorest boy in the land can go into the Navy at $18 to $20 and $30 a month and his keep , and rise to be a commissioned officer at $1700 a year by the time he is twenty-three . What other life offers as good a chance for the poor boy to rise ? If space permitted , examples could be given of the very biggest men in the Navy rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor boy has to work ; and if he will not study or work up , the place for him is to stay down . The Navy has no soft cushion berths for boobs and snobs . It is harden and rise , or get out . Up to the present , the difficulty has not been to get recruits for the Navy ; it has been to get authority from Congress for enough recruits . LESSONS FROM THE WAR From all of which it is evident a new spirit is abroad in Uncle Sam 's Navy . What lessons has the new Navy learned from the war ? As mentioned already , more speed , and longer-ranged guns as against massiveness . In other words , the paramount importance of the battle-cruiser . Also , certain lessons in sloping shots off the turret by making the turret so horizontal that the shell " wo n't bite , " but may ricochet off , on the principle that if you throw a pointed thing at a sloped surface you 'll dent it . On the horizontal surface , it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surfaces so the projectile will not " bite . " Also certain lessons in bulkheads , and division in the body ; so if a shell hurls through , the inflooding rush of waters can be impounded and sequestered instead of swamping the ship . We have also learned certain lessons in shutting off explosions from striking shells . There are also certain inventions to forewarn the approach of submarines and aeroplanes . These are , however , technical points . Big questions in which the public is vitally interested are ? as the gun has beaten armor-plate , is there any chance of Zeppelin , submarine , and hydroaeroplane defeating the function of the dreadnought ? RELATIVE ADVANTAGES OF ZEPPELIN AND SUBMARINE No human being can answer that question definitely yes or no . Here are the disadvantages of each of the new weapons of warfare ?  |p526  page deleted
