A Cozy sitting room on the second floor of a small house is disclosed , as the curtain slowly lifts . It is conventional in furnishing , with a family portrait or two looking down complacently upon the methodically placed chairs , sofa and large mahogany table . The two windows at the right are draped with light curtains which are similar to those neatly hung across the opening in back . This leads to the hall-way and stairs beyond . At the left is a door opening into JANET 'S room . Except for the telephone , with a switch attachment , which rests on the table , there is nothing modern in the room ; all the details , in fact , indicate the settled nature of the occupants who have apparently lived there for many years . The hall-way is dark , but the room itself is softly lighted by the tall red-shaded lamp which stands back of the sofa . The moonlight , too , faintly trickles in at the windows . MR. and MRS . YORK are alone . The door into JANET @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazing at it . She is seated on the sofa and has ceased sewing . He is in a deep chair , by the table , trying to read the evening paper . But he can not seem to concentrate on it ; he looks toward his wife now and then as though both were dwelling on the same thought . YORK , in his late forties , is a rather obvious kindly man with a quiet voice and gentle manner . He wears a frock coat . MRS . YORK , somewhat younger , is also a lovable personality who has expended all her energies within the concentrated limits of her home life . She still wears her formal gray afternoon gown . They are , in fact , a harmoniously happy couple , reticent with regard to their inner feelings , and instinctively submissive to certain conventions which , until now , the easy habit of life has never made them question . ANN YORK With a sighI ca n't help thinking we sha n't see Janet come from that room again . p. 3 ALFRED YORK No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there just as it is . ALFRED YORK Yes . ANN YORK With contented recollectionShe was so happy here . ALFRED YORK She had a good mother . ANN YORK Lovingly eyeing himAnd father , Fred . ALFRED YORK I 'm just an ordinary sort of person . ANN YORK But she appreciated all that you did for her . ALFRED YORK A father is n't much guidance to a daughter . It 's the mother who counts there . ANN YORK I did everything I could to bring her up properly . Sighing againBut times have changed since I was a girl . One has to be so careful . ALFRED YORK It 's the mothers who have changed  --  letting their girls go about just as if they were boys . There would n't be so much trouble , Ann , if all mothers were companionable like you . ANN YORK I was glad I could devote all my time to Janet . I can almost be happy now that I 'm alone  --  thinking of that . p. 4 ALFRED YORK It was the greatest joy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Janet hardly left your side , did she ? ANN YORK No . When I was with her I always felt as though I were walking in a garden of lilies . ALFRED YORK Yes , pure white . ANN YORK I often wondered why she liked white furniture . ALFRED YORK It was like herself somehow , I suppose . ANN YORK She goes to himAnd to-night will be the first time she 's ever been away from me . ShudderingTo-night ! ALFRED YORK There , dear , do n't worry . ANN YORK With instinctive reserve as she takes his handYou know what I 'm thinking ? ALFRED YORK Yes . ANN YORK I hate to think of such things . ALFRED YORK Trying to be cheerfulThen do n't let 's talk of them . Carter is her husband now . ANN YORK I know . It 's strange how girls grow up in a place and then leave when the first man p. 5 ALFRED YORK With consoling assuranceHe 's a good chap and early marriages are best . ANN YORK Yes . And she seemed so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtfully goes to window and gazes outWhat time is it ? ALFRED YORK Just ten . ANN YORK I 'm so glad they told us where they were going . ALFRED YORK But did n't you feel as though it spoiled their little romance for us to know ? ANN YORK SmilingNothing could spoil their romance ; it was like a story-book . But Janet really wanted us to go down to the boat to-morrow and see her off . WistfullyIt must be nice to have a honeymoon in Italy . ALFRED YORK Trying to be cheerful throughoutCarter 's got more money than I had when you and I were married . ANN YORK AffectionatelyBut they wo n't have a happier time over there than we did in Washington , will they ? After another silence I  --  I thought perhaps she 'd ' phone us to let us know she reached the hotel safely . p. 6 ALFRED YORK PlayfullyWe did n't think of ' phoning . ANN YORK Mother did n't have a ' phone then . In recollectionBut I thought of her . They smile ; then she puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chairOh , Fred , I ALFRED YORK UnderstandinglyYou must n't feel like this about Janet , dear . Everything will be as it should be  --  just as it was between us . Carter 's a fine fellow and ANN YORK She 's only a little girl . ALFRED YORK So were you , Ann , when I took you away from your mother . ANN YORK It 's foolish of me I know , but As though wishing to change the subjectThe room and hallway are full of fragrance . ALFRED YORK Suppose we send her wedding flowers to the hospital to-morrow . ANN YORK You are always so thoughtful , Fred . I 'll tell Mary in the morning . ALFRED YORK Shall we go down and look at them again before we go to bed ? ANN YORK Yes ; I 'm tired though . It 's been such a long day . She goes to him tenderly and puts her arms on his shoulders as he now stands facing herFred , it takes me back . p. 7 ALFRED YORK Some twenty years , eh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YORK Yes ; the way it was when we started . ANN YORK It was hard for me to see my little girl go . She kisses him I 've been so happy here with you and Janet . The telephone rings . She goes to itI knew she 'd ' phone . Let me go , Fred . I want to hear her voice . Taking off the receiver eagerlyYes , hello ! Is that you , Janet ? No ? You wish to speak to Mr. York ? Is that you , Carter ? Yes ; he 's here . She slowly hands the receiver to YORK as she stands half trembling with sudden premonitionCarter wants to speak to you . YORK slowly takes the receiverOh , I 'm afraid . ALFRED YORK At ' phoneYes , Carter . StartledWhat 's that ? Coming back here ? To-night ? After a pause Yes , of course : you 'd better come around yourself right away . Wait . The front door will be unlatched . Come right up to the sitting room . He hangs up the receiver and looks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her way here . p. 8 ANN YORK Here ! ALFRED YORK She left the hotel fifteen minutes ago  --  alone . ANN YORK TerrifiedAlone ? ALFRED YORK She has her own key ? ANN YORK Yes . I wanted her always to keep it . But you told Carter to come also ? ALFRED YORK Yes . Has Mary gone upstairs yet ? ANN YORK No ! As YORK goes to telephone and switches itWhat are you doing ? ALFRED YORK Into telephoneIs that you , Mary ? I 've just had a ' phone . We are expecting somebody . Put the front door latch back so he can come right up to us . No , I do n't want to keep you up : then go to bed . Understand ? Good-night . He hangs up the receiver . MRS . YORK has gazed before her during this , as though bewildered . There is a long pause before either speaks : then it is in broken tones , full of an implication that is hardly phrased ANN YORK Fred ; something terrible 's happened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 9 ANN YORK The tone of his voice . ALFRED YORK Now do n't give way : it 's all right . SlowlyPerhaps ANN YORK SlowlyPerhaps what ? ALFRED YORK HesitatingWell , sometimes ANN YORK But Carter must have known she ALFRED YORK Half to himselfIt may be ANN YORK HystericalWhy do n't you say what you think ? ALFRED YORK I remember men telling me ANN YORK Do men ever talk of such things ? ALFRED YORK Yes : afterwards . He apparently hears the maid going upstairs . He goes back to be sure , then turns to his wifeMary has gone up to bed . ANN YORK Do you think Janet will tell us ? ALFRED YORK If not , why is she coming back here ? ANN YORK Where else could she go ? Oh , Fred , this is more than I can stand . Suppose  --  suppose she does n't come ? p. 10 ALFRED YORK Nonsense . Shall we go downstairs ? ANN YORK No ; not where their flowers are . She tries to control her growing agitationWhy does n't she come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Are you sure Carter said she was coming here ? ALFRED YORK Maybe she walked . ANN YORK MurmuringAlone in the street this time of night ? ALFRED YORK There 's no danger . The curtains are pushed open and JANET enters . She goes hysterically to MRS . YORK and buries her face in her mother 's lap , sobbing . YORK comes over beside them , anxiously . JANET YORK , about nineteen , is the personification of sensitive delicacy and fragile grace . Her present agitation is such that , when words fail , she conveys her meaning through groping , broken tones and suggestion . She is wearing her smart " going away " tailor-made gown and hat JANET MERWIN Mother ! Mother ! ANN YORK My girl ! What is it ? ALFRED YORK Wait , Ann . JANET MERWIN Oh , I I p. 11 ANN YORK Do n't cry so . ALFRED YORK Patting her shoulderJanet , dear ! JANET MERWIN Looking up at himFather ! ALFRED YORK Tell us . JANET MERWIN I 'll I 'll tell mother . ANN YORK Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALFRED YORK You 'd better tell me , too , in case ANN YORK Your father 's right , Janet . JANET MERWIN I I ca n't tell it . ALFRED YORK But your mother 's frightened . JANET MERWIN So so was I  --  frightened . ALFRED YORK But , dear ? JANET MERWIN It was different from I did n't know . Why did n't you tell me ? ANN YORK AstonishedTell you ? JANET MERWIN Yes : what marriage means . He said that was marriage . MR. and MRS . YORK exchange looks , slowly realizing the situation p. 12 ANN YORK Did n't your heart tell you ? JANET MERWIN Phrasing her feeling with great difficulty throughoutNot that . How could it ? My heart could n't know that ? It stopped . It seemed to snap . It felt ashamed . I 'm ashamed now . ANN YORK PerplexedBut all the time when Carter was with you here , did n't you  --  did n't your heart ? JANET MERWIN I tell you I never knew there were such things in the world . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me and then I would n't have Oh , why did n't you tell me ? ANN YORK HelplesslyFred ? ALFRED YORK At a lossDo n't  --  do n't be harsh at your mother , Janet . JANET MERWIN Looking upThen why did n't you tell me ? ANN YORK How could your father ? JANET MERWIN Interrupting abruptlyWhy not ? He let me marry Carter when I came and asked him . My father let me go away with Carter . And you both knew ; Carter said you both knew . And neither of you told me . YORK shakes his head slowly as though overcome by it all ; they try , however , to console JANET p. 13 ANN YORK Dear , you  --  you must n't feel like this about Carter . ALFRED YORK TenderlyNo  --  no . JANET MERWIN I ca n't help how I feel . ALFRED YORK But , Janet ; he 's your husband . JANET MERWIN Yes . My husband ! I know that . But I did n't know what it meant having a husband . QuicklyDoes that give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janet . JANET MERWIN More deeply hurt at the thoughtThen if neither of you would tell me , why did n't he tell me before ? ANN YORK ShockedWhy people do n't talk of such things before they 're married , dear . JANET MERWIN They do n't ? ANN YORK How could they be so immodest ? JANET MERWIN Immodest ? Immodest to talk ? , Yet he could ? Oh ! ALFRED YORK What did you think marriage was , dear ? JANET MERWIN SimplyI  --  I thought it was just being together , like you and father . p. 14 ANN YORK InvoluntarilyBut your father and I JANET MERWIN Retreating from them in realization and astonishmentYou and father ! Oh ! ANN YORK Janet . ALFRED YORK Janet ! JANET MERWIN Do n't touch me , father . She moves quickly away from him I do n't want anybody to put their hands on me again . I  --  I have to think . I want to understand what you said .  --  I always knew there was something I did n't understand . IncredulouslyHow could any girl grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you know what  --  what ? Did you know this , when you and Father first ? ANN YORK Hardly able to speakNo ! JANET MERWIN IncredulouslyYou did n't know either , when you were married ? ANN YORK EmphaticallyA good girl should n't JANET MERWIN VehementlyA good girl ! Then I wish I were n't a good girl ! p. 15 ALFRED YORK Janet ! JANET MERWIN PersistentlyMother . Did n't you even feel for father as I did to-night when Carter ? ANN YORK Horrified throughoutNo . No . I loved your father . ALFRED YORK And do n't you love Carter ? JANET MERWIN IncredulouslyIs that love ? ANN YORK It 's part of love . JANET MERWIN IntrospectivelyThen  --  do n't I love Carter ? ALFRED YORK Trying to quiet herOf course , you do . JANET MERWIN Speaking as though overcome with a new revelationI do n't . I do n't . How could I love him if I could n't let  --  ? Oh !  --  If you , mother , loved father and and yet I could n't ALFRED YORK Janet , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? JANET MERWIN Gazing before herI do n't know . I ca n't understand myself  --  ImpulsivelyMother , mother ; I hated him ! p. 16 ANN YORK Janet ! JANET MERWIN Shuddering in recollectionYes  --  yes . His face changed his eyes oh ! And then he  --  he was sorry . There were tears in his eyes . But I was frightened and oh , I thought I belonged to myself . ALFRED YORK KindlyYou belong to Carter , and he 's coming here for you . JANET MERWIN StartledComing here ? ANN YORK Yes . He ' phoned . JANET MERWIN I thought I was safe here in my home . ALFRED YORK Your home is with him now . You 're his wife , Janet . And you promised him JANET MERWIN IndignantlyHow could I promise something I did n't know about ? But you knew what I was promising and you did n't tell me . You did n't tell me ! How could you do such a thing ? It was a crime ! ANN YORK Deeply woundedA crime ? ALFRED YORK Janet , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; yes ; my dear little mother whom I trusted so . p. 17 ANN YORK You 're breaking my heart . I did everything in the world for you . JANET MERWIN With great reproachExcept tell me the one thing I should have known ! ANN YORK Janet ! JANET MERWIN And now I understand the strange look you gave me , mother , when you said good-by . You knew you should have told me . MRS . YORK lowers her head . The outer door down-stairs is heard opening and then closing ALFRED YORK There 's Carter . JANET MERWIN I wo n't see him now . ALFRED YORK Now , Janet : do n't be a foolish girl . JANET MERWIN With a certain calmI 'm going to my own room . ALFRED YORK You must listen to reason . JANET MERWIN I do n't know what you mean by reason . ALFRED YORK Taking hold of her armsJanet , was he ? JANET MERWIN Let me go , father . ALFRED YORK ForcefullyAnswer me . Was Carter unkind or bru p. 18 JANET MERWIN How should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he did n't tell me before I wo n't see him . I wo n't . I wo n't . ANN YORK Janet ! Janet ! JANET goes into her room slamming the door . MRS . YORK holds her hands out after her . YORK seems thoroughly aroused to anger ANN YORK Turning helplessly to her husbandYou do n't think it was because ? ALFRED YORK DeterminedThat 's what I mean to find out . Go to her . ANN YORK And she called me a criminal ! MRS . YORK almost timidly goes into the room , closing the door . CARTER is heard coming up the stairs . YORK turns and waits with suppressed excitement . After a moment CARTER MERWIN enters . There is a look of anxiety upon his strongly modeled face . In appearance he is immediately ingratiating since his whole manner suggests great sincerity of character . He is in his early thirties . He stands there looking at YORK and throughout the following seems deeply moved with pity for JANET . They speak with subdued intensity , never raising their voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janet 's here ? ALFRED YORK Yes . With her mother . CARTER MERWIN RelievedI 'm glad . He starts towards doorPoor little girl . ALFRED YORK Stopping himWhere are you going ? CARTER MERWIN To tell her not to worry . ALFRED YORK You ca n't see her now . CARTER MERWIN Why do you stop me ? ALFRED YORK She 's my daughter and  --  CARTER MERWIN QuietlyMy wife . ALFRED YORK Halted somewhat by his toneWhat kind of a man are you ? CARTER MERWIN What do you mean ? ALFRED YORK You know what I mean . CARTER MERWIN I do n't understand . ALFRED YORK She 's come here seeking my protection . CARTER MERWIN Protection ? Her greatest protection would have been a little knowledge . p. 20 ALFRED YORK Controlling himself with difficultyWe kept for you a girl 's greatest gift to her husband : her innocence . CARTER MERWIN She brought me only ignorance . ALFRED YORK I tell you , you sha n't go to her now . CARTER MERWIN But she must see how I care for her . She must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me help her  --  be kind to her . You do n't think I have come to take her away unwillingly ? ALFRED YORK Then why are you here ? CARTER MERWIN Because I do n't want her to be afraid . ALFRED YORK Damn you ! CARTER MERWIN Mr. York ! ALFRED YORK Why did you frighten her ? CARTER MERWIN I did n't frighten her . ALFRED YORK What did ? CARTER MERWIN A fact . The commonest fact in life . ALFRED YORK Which a man who knows life should have learned how to tell a CARTER MERWIN Most men do n't have to tell women . Twice you 've insinuated p. 21 ALFRED YORK She left you ; did n't she ? CARTER MERWIN Yes . She said nothing . She cried and she struck me . ALFRED YORK AstonishedStruck you ? CARTER MERWIN Yes . ALFRED YORK Coming closer to himThen you did give her cause ? CARTER MERWIN I came to her with a man 's love . ALFRED YORK And acted like a  --  CARTER MERWIN Say it . ALFRED YORK Like a brute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms , but trying to control himselfMr . York ! I love her . Do you hear ? I love her . ALFRED YORK But forgot what kind of a girl she was . CARTER MERWIN Hardly believingWhat are you saying ? ALFRED YORK Is n't it the truth ? CARTER MERWIN Still holding him and speaking tenselyDo you think because the language men have to use is the same to all women , that the feeling back of it ca n't be different ? Do n't you know I felt differently ? I tell you I love her . No , no , it was n't as you think . I was kind . I understood she had never I understood . But I thought she knew what marriage was ; thought she was happy coming to me ; thought she was willingly coming to me . But she made me feel as though I were n't her husband . I was only a thief in her room . Not the man she loved ; but a criminal ! p. 22 ALFRED YORK Staring at himA criminal ! You , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like a criminal ? Did n't you give her to me ? ALFRED YORK With indignant sarcasmI thought I gave her to a man of honor . CARTER MERWIN Yet you never asked me one question . I never thought of it myself till she struck me . Then the crime we had done her stunned me  --  before I could talk to her . I did n't blame her . I blamed myself and you : for you gave her to me , as the service says ; but you did n't tell her a single thing about what was to happen . And I took her from your hands  --  I who had talked of everything our life was to told together  --  everything but that . ALFRED YORK Carter ! CARTER MERWIN We 've made the fact of marriage seem horrible . Oh , I 'm ashamed to my soul of my part in this crime . ALFRED YORK How dare you speak like this ! CARTER MERWIN But is n't it the truth ? Did you or I do anything to make her see the beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplest fact ? Did you or I do anything else to protect her ? p. 23 ALFRED YORK Do you realize  --  CARTER MERWIN Oh , if you 'd seen the look in her eyes  --  the helpless shocked expression . Instead of the man 's pure love I brought her , she might have had to face anything , anything . Think of it : anything ! Good God ! It 's terrible . She was helpless and she knew nothing  --  nothing . Going to himBut you and I knew : you knew life , knew men . Yet neither you nor the minister ever asked me one question . You never asked me what was also her right to know before she came to me . You never asked me what my life had been or whether I was fit to be her husband . YORK tries to protestOh , you must listen to me ; for you stand there judging me and forgetting what you , her father , had done to her . I 'm ashamed of myself and so should you be . You asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my body . ALFRED YORK Fundamentally off endedDo you think I would have insulted you with such a question ? CARTER MERWIN But you were willing to take a chance on your daughter . ALFRED YORK No man who was n't decent would have married a sweet pure girl like Janet . CARTER MERWIN Would n't he ? I know hundreds ! ! As they stand there tense , facing each other , the door opens ; they turn toward it . There is a pause and MRS . YORK , almost a changed woman , slowly comes into the room . She closes the door . No word is spoken . CARTER stands there looking at her in question . Her eyes are on the ground . YORK moves as one dazed to the deep chair and later sinks into it , staring fixedly before him p. 24 CARTER MERWIN Very quietlyShe knows I am here ? ANN YORK Yes . CARTER MERWIN She 'll see me ? ANN YORK She sent me away . CARTER MERWIN UnderstandingShe wants to be alone . ANN YORK Yes . CARTER MERWIN After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocks , speaking with ill-controlled emotionJanet ! Janet ! It 's Carter . I sha n't see you till you wish me . But do n't be afraid , little girl . Do n't be afraid any more . We 'll go away together and everything will be as you wish , everything as you wish  --  He waits but there is no answer . He sits upon the sofa unable to speak ANN YORK She crosses to him , placing her hand on his shoulderDo n't , Carter . CARTER MERWIN With deep convictionIt can never be the same . ANN YORK In time . CARTER MERWIN No . She 'll never forget the shock  --  that first shock . p. 25 ANN YORK Women do . CARTER MERWIN How could they ? ANN YORK She loves you . She broke down and cried . She sees now it was n't your fault . CARTER MERWIN But it was . ANN YORK As she sits down slowly on the sofa beside him I never knew there could be girls like Janet . CARTER MERWIN She must see there are other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the door againJanet ! Janet ! Let me be your friend ! I 'll protect you . It 's my right now . I love you , little girl . I 'll wait till  --  But there is no answer . He sits down again , murmuringIt could all have been spared if one of us had had a little courage . ANN YORK Staring before herYes ; it takes courage . CARTER MERWIN Why should it ? ANN YORK She knows now . CARTER MERWIN And it all could have been so simple . ALFRED YORK Still staring quiltily before himCriminals ! MRS . YORK looks slowly at him , but CARTER 'S eyes lift to the door , hoping it will open again . There is a long silence . Then the curtain slowly closes them from view                                                   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
