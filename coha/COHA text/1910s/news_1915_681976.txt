txt Germans and their attitude toward the proposed credit of $1.000.000.000 for the Allies cut a large figure in yesterday 's discussion of that financial transaction . On the one hand it was suggested that Germany embarrass its enemies by bringing out a $500,000,000 loan here . On the other it was intimated that great banking firms with German affiliations might participate in the huge loan proposed by the Anglo-French commission . The threat of German depositors to start runs on banks participating in the loan continued to be a live topic , but the danger was minimized . There was a report rn the financial district that efforts were making to arouse several big banking firms with pronounced Teutonic sympathies to a recognition of the helpful effect of the proposed financing in the determination of the war , and that if sufficient encouragement were received a backfire to the work of the commission would be started in the form of a big German loan . It was suggested that if a loan of 5500,000,000 were brought out for Germany the subscriptions would absorb a large share of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously impede the flotation of the credit for the Allies . This propaganda was not taken seriously in quarters close to the firm of J. P. Morgan &; Co .. partly because it would be impossible to get any considerable amount of goods from this country into Germany , and partly because of the lack of enthusiasm shown by German-Americans over the relatively small offering of $10,000,000 of German Government notes broUght out some months ago ' may E'handler Bros --  : & -- -.-Co:; It Is understood that enthusiasm over the German cause did not extend to the point of any widespread response to this offering , and that most of the notes were left on the underwriters ' hands . Seeking More Banking Aid . The other development was what was regarded as an eleventh-hour effort to conciliate firms with German sympathies which felt affronted because none of their members had been invited to meet the visiting bankers on their arrives here . A visit by James J. Hill to the offices of Kuhn . Loeb &; Co. was construed as the first step in an effort to enlist the powerful sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banking institution in the country , in support of the loan . Mr. Hill said afterward that he had only made a social call on Jacob I. Schiff as an old friend , but it was regarded as significant that Mr. Schiff had suddenly returned to the city for the day It was reported afterward that Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. would not take unkindly an invitation to join hands with other big firms in financing a commercial credit A banker who is looked upon as a leader among the larger pro-German banking houses in New York said of these overtures : " There is no doubt in my mind that many banking houses with Teutonic affiliations might be induced to take part in this undertaking , despite the natural course of their sympathies , not because It would be helpful to the Allies , but because it may be essential to the maintenance of the commerce and industries of the United States . " It was made plain that some pro-German bankers felt keenly the failure of the men who are guiding the activities of the Anglo-French commission to Include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men said yesterday that they were primarily Americans , regardless of the direction of their sympathies toward foreigners . They regard their interests and the welfare of the - United States as bound together , and would not hesitate to join in the loan if convinced that it was for the furtherance of American trade . Depositors ' Threats Minimized . Neither the Commissioners nor the American bankers with whom they had talked , outside of a few from the Middle West , appear to be seriously concerned over the threat of German opposition to the proposed loan . A number of threatening letters have been received by the commission , but these are no more than they expected , and none of them bore evidence of having emanated from responsible quarters . The National City Bank , with 2,500 correspondent banks throughout the country , had not received a single protest from these banks yesterday , and of its tens - of thousands of depositors only one had objected to the bank participating in the loan . Other institutions were less fortunate in that respeot , having heard from a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if It develops , is looked for in the Middle West , and it is believed that Mr. Hill had this In mind when he called attention to the relation between the proposed credit and the market for the tremendous harvests now being gathered . It is with the possibility of concerted opposition In mind that the negotiations are proceeding slowly . It is the desire of both the Commissioners and the local bankers that the educational campaign being carried on should keep pace with the conferences . so that the feeling of various sections toward the plan can be moscured . Expect Some Friction . " I suppose , " said one of the men who has been acting for this country in the negotiations since they were begun by cable some months ago , " that we can not expect smooth sailing in such troublous times as these . In many localities German-Americans are influential in banking matters . They may cause discord in their institutions . They should not be allowed to have their way if they are influenced by selfish motives . I think that when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized that w.e are not instigated by any desire to help the Allies n-in their struggle , but by the immediate necessity for helping ourselves . : Doubtless many German depositors will offer strenuous objections . To them I should say that the depositors are not ' running the banks . " In the course of the day the several members of the commission discussed various phases of their plan with leading bankers , but they held no sessions as a whole and had no opportunity to I learn how their suggestions had been received by the banking community . Members of the commission visited friends in the Wall Street district , but Basil B. Blackett . Secretary to the commission , said late in the afternoon that the preliminaries to a serious exchange of views had not yet been cleared away . Some additional details of the plan , proposed by the commission came to light yesterday , following a visit downtown . It is proposed to canvass the entire country for support for the loan , if one is agreed upon , and to form an underwriting syndicate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heretofore attempted . The notes or bonds are to run for a comparatively short period , rive years , according to one suggestion ; but not more than twice that length of time at the outside . and are to pay 5 per cent . net . That is to say , they will be free from British or French income taxes To make refunding easier , the maturities may be arranged in five installments . The securities would be a first lien by the issuing nations , taking precedence over all domestic debts . Although staggered at first by the amount which the Allies want , New York bankers began asking themselves yesterday if . after all , the United States is not rich enough to absorb a billiondollar loan . Men who had been saying that not more than one-tenth that amount could be placed with investors were half convinced yesterday that the loan could be carried through as a great popular movement for continued prosperity here in spite of the wreckage of industrial Europe . It was said that the temper of the American public had been altered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that a loan for the Allies would receive much more popular support than would have been the ease before the sinking of the Arabic . The commission expects to see a number of financiers from other cities today , among them Festus J. Wade of St. Louis and Robert Windsor of Kidder , Peabody &; Co. , Boston . Herbert Myrick , President of the Orange Judd Company , publisher of farm papers , sent a letter to the Reading Commission yesterday offering on behalf of American farmers to grant the Allies a credit of $1.000.000,00* to be taken in cotton and grain . He proposed that the farmers receive pay in notes running up to eighteen months , and that Great Britain and France agree to spend the entire sum in four months for a total of approximately 5,000,000 bales of cotton and 5ou , o00,1 ; 00 bushels of grain . Fatherland Fights Loan . As an incident indicating the character of the campaign against the loan , it was noteworthy that the Fatherland , whose editor was shown recently to be in re- ' eeipt of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the newspapers last night a paid advertisement , to he inserted next to war news , saying that " the Money Trust is plotting to lend one billion dollars of the American people 's mcney to Bankrupt Russia , Broken France , and Insolvent England . " The characterizations of the Allies were to be printed in capitols and black type
