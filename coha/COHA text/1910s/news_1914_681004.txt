txt Tile international situation confronting the United States was discussed on the floor of the Senate this afternoon with greater frankness that had been beard there since Spanish war days . The Isolation of the United States from the great powers , which President Wilson sketched to Senators of the Committee on Foreign Relations three weeks ago , was referred to in unmistakable terms , while Mr. Lodge of Massachusetts , ranking Republican of the committee , told the Senate that unless the l'resident 's wishes for the repeal of I the d ' . scriminating Panama Canal toll provision were carried out , the hostility of many nations might load the United States to " serious loss or serious injury or wars or something like war . " ? Mr. Lodge 's statement of the " perilous character " of the foreign problems , now in the hands of the President . made a profound impression on the Small . His speech was the final expression of the general indignation , aroused by insinuatiens of Mr. Bristow of Kansas , a radical Repeblican , that the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Democratic platform for free tolls to American coastwise shipping . Mr. Bristow denied that be intended any reflection on the President 's integrity , but Republicans and Democrats alike integireted Ins remarks as an assault Chi the ' President 's honesty and ** 1 : e.ertaliily caught the irctlifiton , " Said Mr. Lodge ' , " that the Senator implied that the influence of great corporations had been very strong in determining the President 's attitude . I do n't believe the President has changed his mind . I believe he has held this conviction all along . I believe he has been guided entirely by considerations of the honor and credit of the United States in her relations with foreign countries . " I think the President sees that the time has come to retract some steps taken subsequent to March . 1909. 1 think he has the feeling that somehow or other the United States has fallen into the unfortunate and unhappy position of incurring the active dislike of many nations , instead of the friendship which she once possessed , and the distrust of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like to put the United States into the attitude of an outlaw among the nations . Ile feels she should nave all the prestige she ever had , and this prestige is not to be obtained by disregarding international obligations and reversing policies long held by the United States , simply to gratify some passing fashion or whim . I believe the President regards foreign relations as above party . " I am not in any position where I must defend the President , but I can not sit by when an injustice is done to the President of the United States , in whose hands rests the conduct of all foreign affairs , without making some protest simply as an American citizen . " I differ as much as possible from =resident on general political principles , but that does not hold me here when the President is dealing with foreign relations in some respects of a most perilous and difficult character . And when he says on his high responsibility to the Congress of the United States that a certain step in foreign relations is necessary to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; necessary to aid him in saving the United States perhaps from serious loss or serious injury or wars or something like war ? if he says that on his high responsibility I think it becomes those , who feel as I do on foreign affairs , not to block his plans . " President Wilson had made no such statement to Congress as that described by Senator Lodge , but those who heard the Senator got the impression that Mr. Lodge was referring to the President 's unfolding of the situation to the Foreign Relations Committee at the White House one evening about three weeks ago . While Mr. Lodge did not go into particulars as to the perilous aspects of the situation . it was understood that he meant the strained relations of the United States with Great Britain on account of the Panama tolls dispute : with all maritime nations sympathizing with England ; with Japan on account of Japanese exclusion ; with Russia on account of the abrogation of the treaty of 1832 , with Colombia on account of the spoliation of Panama , and with Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bristow Started It . The discussion of the Panama tolls came up suddenly in the course of a speech by Mr. Bristow in favor of woman suffrage . He spoke of the President 's explanation to a delegation of women that he could not publicly indorse woman suffrage because be had to confine himself " to those things which have been embodied as promises to the people at an election , " and compared that with his action in regard to the platform declaration for discrimination in canal tolls . " The ladies were very much impressed as well as depressed . " said Mr. Bristow , " by the party shackles with which our President seemed to be bound hand , foot , and tongue . The platform , Politically speaking , was sacred to him . These good women went away sore In spirit and sick at heart . They had read of the fine courage of our President and his manly independence  --  they tad not expected to find such abject servitude to party commands . So they went away . some in sadness and sorrow , others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Dec. 8 last . " That was his answer to the ladles . But when the powerful railroad influences , behind the mask of English interests . ' got into action . this strict rule . which he set for himself . disappeared , and he declared that ' the exemption constitutes a very mistaken Policy from every point of view . ' " When the women asked a word from him in behalf of suffrage , he said he had to confine himself to those things which have been embodied as promises to the people at an election . ' When the English interests appealed to him , he forgot the promises made to the people at an election , ' and was very willing to speak for somebody besides himself . The greed of the railroads and the audacious claims of Great Britain seem more potent with our President than the appeal of the womanhood of the nation . So . I say , the consideration of this amendment has been educational in more ways than one . It has given us a line upon some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be exceedingliy uses ful to the dountry in the future . That Single Terns Plank . " For instance , the Democratic platform contains this declaration : ' We favor a single Presidential term ? ? ? and we pledge the candidate of this convention to this principle , ' At the proper time will the President interpret this plank in harmony with his position as to suffrage , or as to canal tolls ? I believe it was the peerless Democratic leader , the Hon. William Jennings Bryan , who recently declared that ' la. man who violates a party platform is a criminal Worse than the man who embezzles money . ' In the meantime we shall with interest watch the conflict that now appears to bo going on between party promises and evasive political strategy . " Senator Owen of Oklahoma took the floor at once . " There has not been in the great Executive chair , " he said , " a man in the history of this country who has more honored it . who has been more serviceable or who has been more appreciated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator from Kansas should attempt to place him in the light of an instrument of the Canadian railroads and of abject servility to the party and of equivocation and injustice toward the women of the country does little credit to the Senator . We all know how these conventions are conducted . There is not a man on I this floor who does not understand how I the Committee on Resolutions is framed , how a few  --  select , active , ingenious , strenuous men  --  will impress their view upon that platform and undertake to aulson the sentiment of 45,000,000 people . ' In so far as the question is digested by the members of the convention , in so far as they represent fairly and justly the sentiment of the party , their declarations deserve to be recognized . But as far as the question of Panama toils is concerned , that question has not been passed on by the national Democracy . That plank put into the Baltimore platform is not binding on the conscience of a Democrat . It did not in truth represent the solemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but represented only the ingenious placing into the platform of the sentiment of some gentlemen who found themselves in a position to voice what they thought was the sentiment of the party . " Bryan on the Committee . Mr. Owen did not explain whom he meant to hold responsible for the plank . The plank was drafted by a sub-committee composed of Senator O'Gorman of New York , who openly favors American discrimination , and William Jennings Bryan , now Secretary of State . The sub-committee to which these two reported was slightly larger , and several Senators , who were members , have since admitted full knowledge of the plank and asserted that Mr. Bryan also knew what was going on around him . " I am strongly opposed to free tolls as fundamentally unjust to the taxpayer , " went on Mr. Owen . " I oppose them because not a dollar which free tolls would give as a privilege to coastwise shipping would find its way into the pockets of the people . It is common sense that when the people are taxed 8400,000.000 to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain , should at least pay enough for its maintenance . " Mr. Chamberlain of Oregon , Chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs , and one of the warmest Senate advocates of fres tolls , repudiated Mr. Bristow 's : ougge-9Uon that the President had been improperly influenced . He said , however , that if any plank in the Democratic platform meant anything the Panama tolls plank meant what it said. ; " If ' the platform , " he said , " is Intended to stand on rather than to get in on and get off as soon as in , then this plank is binding . If the plank does pot bind the party no plank does . And if the declaration of Democrats on the floor of the House and of the Senate mean anything they mean that Democratic Senators and Representatives have indorsed the plank . All through the campaign that plank was an issue in the Coast States , and who knows how many Republicans were won by it ? " Did n't the President himself , " asked Senator Smoot of Utah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am informed so . " replied Mr. Chamberlain . " i did not hear him , but I have seen the speech printed . I , for one , will not stultify myself . Further than that I am not letting this delicate situation influence my judgment . We ought to stand up for our rights. - hashes the Railroads . Senator Smoot then read the list of the eleven Senators who voted against the Burton amendment a year ago providing equality of treatment for American and foreign ships . No Democrat 's name appearea on the list . " Low tolls through the canal , " said Mr. Chamberlain . " will be an automatic regulator of freight rates . The people of the country ought to receive that benefit when they will be taxed $16,001000 a year to maintain the canal . It is a matter of history that for years the transcontinental railways prevented the digging of the canal . And through those Years of debate Senators could look into the galleries and recognize the face of Mr. Schwerin , who was lobbying against the canal. - Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Relations Committee , said that he did not believe for a moment the President was influenced by the railways . Underwood Sees Wilson . Representative Underwood had a talk with President Wilson to-day on the canal tolls situation . His primary object in going to the White House was to endeavor to persuade the President to submit a message to Congress setting forth explicitly why it was necessary in the President 's opinion that the free tolls provision should be wiped off the statute hooks . The House Democrats feel that the President should assume the responsibility for asking them to repudiate a party platform pledge , and that he should not expect them to reverse their previous action without pointing out the reasons for a change in party attitude . Some time ago the President expressed a willingness to send a message to Congress , advocating repeal legislation . But it was understood that the President told Mr. Underwood to-day that on account of delicate international questions ' bein , , involved he did not feel at liberty to discuss the matter in a public message or address . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canal would not be opened to Mitigation until next- year , : the . PreSident , . it . was understood , took the . poSition that there , was no reason for shurry-in the proposed repeal legislation and the question needed not be regarded as of 1 immediate concern . Representative Mann , It became known to-day , would resist to the last ditch the President 's proposal for the repeal of the free tolls provision . To-night during the discussion of the Alaskan railway bill in the House , Mr. Mann taunted the Democratic side with the charge that President Wilson was repudiating the Panama Canal toll plank of the Baltimore platform . Mr. Mann was discussing the provision in the existing law for the payment of the Panama Canal employes for loss by death or injuries . He said he was responsible for having placed in the law a provision which authorized the President to issue regulations under which the canal employes should be so compensated . But , said Mr. Mann , the President had not issued any such regulations . e I assume in my ignorance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President finds time aside from his efforts to repudiate the Democratic canal tolls plank in the Baltimore platform , these Panama regulations will be issued . " It was learned to-day that there was strong opposition in Alabama , Mr , ' On derwood 's State , to the repeal of the toll clause . The iron , steel , and coal interests of Alabama had been counting on free tolls to enable them to build up a larga trade with the Pacific Coast cities .
