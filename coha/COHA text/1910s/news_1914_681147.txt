txt The country is to be congratulated that Mr. LA FoLLETTE of Wisconsin is only a Senator . As such lie has an individual 's influence upon one of the two houses which must reach an agreement before there can be any result , and none then unless the President approves . The Senator would be more important if he were an Interstate Commerce Commissioner . As such he would alone be one-quarter of a majority , and if only three Commissioners were to agree with him there would be no hope of prosperity for the railways , and therefore none for the country . It would be a calamity if a position of such importance were held by an official of the cast of mind illustrated by the Senator 's remarks upon the alleged propaganda for the advance of railway rates by influence brought to bear upon the Commission . Nothing Mr. LA FOLLETTE said is so ' important as the self-revelation of his remarks . The sort of thing which liel fears will influence the Commission is the sort of thing which would influence him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in public affairs . His remarks were upon the answer to his requisition to the Commission to send ' to the Senate " all anonymous letters " and communications , and all written " - or printed letters , and communica " tions received with signatures there " to , and all circulars , clippings , news ' papers or magazine articles , marked ' " or otherwise . received by the Com " mission or members thereof , which " were manifestly designed to influ " ence the action of said Commission , " with more of the same insinuating sort . That is the sort of mental food upon which the Senator fed when he produced his masterpiece regarding the concentration of wealth in the United States , and fired the shot which has been heard wherever the echoes of the Pujo investigation have penetrated . Many of these " anonymous and other " communications had been rubber stamped out of the Executive offices by one of the President 's clerks , and the Senator more than suspected that the President had been hobbled by the interests in the manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensation , we are told , rivaled the Mexican topics , the Chamber was filled , and the Senator was allowed to proceed without annoying interruptions by the dncredulous . Thus are we governed , and this is the calibre and the frame of mind of our governors . The Interstate Commerce Commission shines by contrast . Never once has it betrayed fear of bribery or assassination ifit persisted in its determination to reduce rates at any and every cost . Never has it shown the weakness of mind or conscience which the Senator 's speech accuses it of . There is not the slightest proof that any Commissioner ever saw any I of the " anonymous or other " cornmunieations which nobody besides the rubber stamp clerk in the Executive office is known to have seen . The Senator 's own shocking story is the Commission 's sole and sufficient de , fense against a charge too preposterous to find favor outside of a company of hasheesh dreamers . There certainly are signs of what the Senator calls " depraved ingenuity " in the case , but it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
