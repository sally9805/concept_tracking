SCENE  --  The seamen 's forecastle of the British tramp steamer Glencairn on a foggy night midway on the voyage between New York and Cardiff . An irregular shaped compartment , the sides of which almost meet at the far end to form a triangle . Sleeping bunks about six feet long , ranged three deep with a space of three feet separating the upper from the lower , are built against the sides . On the right above the bunks three or four portholes can be seen . In front of the bunks , rough wooden benches . Over the bunks on the left , a lamp in a bracket . In the left foreground , a doorway . On the floor near it , a pail with a tin dipper . Oilskins are hanging from a hook near the doorway . The far side of the forecastle is so narrow that it contains only one series of bunks . In under the bunks a glimpse can be had of sea chests , suit cases , seaboots , etc. , jammed in indiscriminately . At regular intervals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's whistle can be heard above all the other sounds . Five men are sitting on the benches talking . They are dressed in dirty patched suits of dungaree , flannel shirts , and all are in their stocking feet . Four of the men are pulling on pipes and the air is heavy with rancid tobacco smoke . Sitting on the top bunk in the left foreground , a Norwegian , Paul , is softly playing some folk song on a battered accordion . He stops from time to time to listen to the conversation . In the lower bunk in the rear a dark-haired , hard-featured man is lying apparently asleep . One of his arms is stretched limply over the side of the bunk . His face is very pale , and drops of clammy perspiration glisten on his forehead . It is nearing the end of the dog watch  --  about ten minutes to eight in the evening . COCKY  --  ( a weazened runt of a man . He is telling a story . The others are listening with amused , incredulous faces , interrupting him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Makin ' love to me , she was ! It 's Gawd 's truth ! A bloomin ' nigger . Greased all over with cocoanut oil , she was . Gawd blimey , I could n't stand ' er . Bloody old cow , I says ; and with that I fetched ' er a biff on the ear wot knocked ' er silly , an '  --  ( He is interrupted by a roar of laughter from the others. ) p. 3 DAVIS  --  ( a middle-aged man with black hair and mustache ) You 're a liar , Cocky . SCOTTY  --  ( a dark young fellow ) Ho-ho ! Ye werr neverr in New Guinea in yourr life , I 'm thinkin ' . OLSON  --  ( a Swede with a drooping blonde mustache  --  with ponderous sarcasm ) Yust tink of it ! You say she wass a cannibal , Cocky ? DRISCOLL  --  ( a brawny Irishman with the battered features of a prizefighter ) How cud ye doubt ut , Ollie ? A quane av the naygurs she musta been surely . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wid a beauthiful , divil-may-care rake av a man the loike av Cocky ? ( a burst of laughter from the crowd ) COCKY  --  ( indignantly ) Gawd strike me dead if it ai n't true , every bleedin ' word of it . ' Appened ten year ago come Christmas . SCOTTY  --  ' T was a Christmas dinner she had her eyes on . DAVIS  --  He 'd a been a tough old bird . DRISCOLL  --  ' T is luck for both av ye ye escaped ; for the quane av the cannibal isles wad ' a died av the belly ache the day afther Christmas , divil a doubt av ut . ( The laughter at this is long and loud. ) p. 4 COCKY  --  ( sullenly ) Blarsted fat ' eads ! ( The sick man in the lower bunk in the rear groans and moves restlessly . There is a hushed silence . All the men turn and stare at him . ) DRISCOLL  --  Ssshh ! ( in a hushed whisper ) We 'd best no be talkin ' so loud and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( He tiptoes softly to the side of the bunk . ) Yank ! You 'd be wantin ' a drink av wather , maybe ? ( Yank does not reply . Driscoll bends over and looks at him . ) It 's asleep he is , sure enough . His breath is chokin ' in his throat loike wather gurglin ' in a poipe . ( He comes back quietly and sits down . All are silent , avoiding each other 's eyes . ) COCKY  --  ( after a pause ) Pore devil ! It 's over the side for ' im , Gawd ' elp ' im . DRISCOLL  --  Stop your croakin ' ! He 's not dead yet and , praise God , he 'll have many a long day yet before him . SCOTTY  --  ( shaking his head doubtfully ) He 's bod , mon , he 's verry bod . DAVIS  --  Lucky he 's alive . Many a man 's light woulda gone out after a fall like that . p. 5 OLSON  --  You saw him fall ? DAVIS  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' down in number two hold to do some chippin ' . He puts his leg over careless-like and misses the ladder and plumps straight down to the bottom . I was scared to look over for a minute , and then I heard him groan and I scuttled down after him . He was hurt bad inside for the blood was drippin ' from the side of his mouth . He was groanin ' hard , but he never let a word out of him . COCKY  --  An ' you blokes remember when we ' auled ' im in ' ere ? Oh , ' ell , ' e says , oh , ' ell  --  like that , and nothink else . OLSON  --  Did the captain know where he iss hurted ? COCKY  --  That silly ol ' josser ! Wot the ' ell would ' e know abaht anythink ? SCOTTY  --  ( scornfully ) He fiddles in his mouth wi ' a bit of glass . DRISCOLL  --  ( angrily ) The divil 's own life ut is to be out on the lonely sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean but a spindle-shanked , gray-whiskered auld fool the loike av him . ' T was enough to make a saint shwear to see him wid his gold watch in his hand , tryin ' to look as wise as an owl on a tree , and all the toime he not knowin ' whether ' t was cholery or the barber 's itch was the matter wid Yank . p. 6 SCOTTY  --  ( sardonically ) He give him a dose of salts , na doot ? DRISCOLL  --  Divil a thing he gave him at all , but looked in the book he had wid him , and shook his head , and walked out widout sayin ' a word , the second mate afther him no wiser than himself , God 's curse on the two av thim ! COCKY  --  ( after a pause ) Yank was a good shipmate , pore beggar . Lend me four bob in Noo Yark , ' e did . DRISCOLL  --  ( warmly ) A good shipmate he was and is , none betther . Ye said no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is since first I shipped wid him , and we 've stuck together iver since through good luck and bad . Fights we 've had , God help us , but ' t was only when we 'd a bit av drink taken , and we always shook hands the nixt mornin ' . Whativer was his was mine , and many 's the toime I 'd a been on the beach or worse , but for him . And now  --  ( His voice trembles as he fights to control his emotion . ) Divil take me if I 'm not startin ' to blubber loike an auld woman , and he not dead at all , but goin ' to live many a long year yet , maybe . DAVIS  --  The sleep 'll do him good . He seems better now . OLSON  --  If he wude eat something  --  p. 7 DRISCOLL  --  Wud ye have him be eatin ' in his condishun ? Sure it 's hard enough on the rest av us wid nothin ' the matther wid our insides to be stomachin ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) It 's a starvation ship . DAVIS  --  Plenty o ' work and no food  --  and the owners ridin ' around in carriages ! OLSON  --  Hash , hash ! Stew , stew ! Marmalade , py damn ! ( He spits disgustedly . ) COCKY  --  Bloody swill ! Fit only for swine is wot I say . DRISCOLL  --  And the dishwather they disguise wid the name av tea ! And the putty they call bread ! My belly feels loike I 'd swalleyed a dozen rivets at the thought av ut ! And sea-biscuit that 'd break the teeth av a lion if he had the misfortune to take a bite at one ! ( Unconsciously they have all raised their voices , forgetting the sick man in their sailor 's delight at finding something to grumble about . ) PAUL  --  ( swings his feet over the side of his bunk , stops playing his accordion , and says slowly ) And rot-ten po-tay-toes ! ( He starts in playing again . The sick man gives a groan of pain. ) p. 8 DRISCOLL  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all av you . ' T is a hell av a thing for us to be complainin ' about our guts , and a sick man maybe dyin ' listenin ' to us. ( gets up and shakes his fist at the Norwegian ) God stiffen you , ye square-head scut ! Put down that organ av yours or I 'll break your ugly face for you . Is that banshee schreechin ' fit music for a sick man ? ( The Norwegian puts his accordion in the bunk and lies back and closes his eyes . Driscoll goes over and stands beside Yank . The steamer 's whistle sounds particularly loud in the silence . ) DAVIS  --  Damn this fog ! ( reaches in under a bunk and yanks out a pair of seaboots , which he pulls on ) My lookout next , too . Must be nearly eight bells , boys . ( With the exception of Olson , all the men sitting up put on oilskins , sou'westers , seaboots , etc. , in preparation for the watch on deck . Olson crawls into a lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . OLSON  --  ( disgustedly ) Nothin ' but yust dirty weather all disvoyage . I yust ca n't sleep when weestle blow . ( He turns his back to the light and is soon fast asleep and snoring. ) p. 9 SCOTTY  --  If this fog keeps up , I 'm tellin ' ye , we 'll no be in Carrdiff for a week or more . DRISCOLL  --  ' T was just such a night as this the auld Dover wint down . Just about this toime ut was , too , and we all sittin ' round in the fo'c'stle , Yank beside me , whin all av a suddint we heard a great slitherin ' crash , and the ship heeled over till we was all in a heap on wan side . What came afther I disremimber exactly , except ' t was a hard shift to get the boats over the side before the auld teakittle sank . Yank was in the same boat wid me , and sivin morthal days we drifted wid scarcely a drop of wather or a bite to chew on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whin I wanted to jump into the ocean , roarin ' mad wid the thirst . Picked up we were on the same day wid only Yank in his senses , and him steerin ' the boat . COCKY  --  ( protestingly ) Blimey but you 're a cheerful blighter , Driscoll ! Talkin ' abaht shipwrecks in this ' ere blushin ' fog . ( Yank groans and stirs uneasily , opening his eyes . Driscoll hurries to his side . ) DRISCOLL  --  Are ye feelin ' any betther , Yank ? YANK  --  ( in a weak voice ) No . DRISCOLL  --  Sure , you must be . You look as sthrong as an ox . ( appealing to the others ) Am I tellin ' him a lie ? p. 10 DAVIS  --  The sleep 's done you good . COCKY  --  You 'll be ' avin your pint of beer in Cardiff this day week . SCOTTY  --  And fish and chips , mon ! YANK  --  ( peevishly ) What 're yuh all lyin ' fur ? D'yuh think I 'm scared to  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about to say . ) DRISCOLL  --  Do n't be thinkin ' such things ! ( The ship 's bell is heard heavily sounding eight times . From the forecastle head above the voice of the lookout rises in a long wail : Aaall 's welll . The men look uncertainly at Yank as if undecided whether to say good-by or not . ) YANK  --  ( in an agony of fear ) Do n't leave me , Drisc ! I 'm dyin ' , I tell yuh . I wo n't stay here alone with everyone snorin ' . I 'll go out on deck . ( He makes a feeble attempt to rise , but sinks back with a sharp groan . His breath comes in wheezy gasps . ) Do n't leave me , Drisc ! ( His face grows white and his head falls back with a jerk . ) . DRISCOLL  --  Do n't be worryin ' , Yank . I 'll not move a step out av here  --  and let that a divil av a bo'sun curse his black head off . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that Yank is bad took and I 'll be stayin ' wid him a while yet . p. 11 COCKY  --  Right-o . ( Cocky , Davis and Scotty go out quietly . ) COCKY  --  ( from the alleyway ) Gawd blimey , the fog 's thick as soup . DRISCOLL  --  Are ye satisfied now , Yank ? ( Receiving no answer , he bends over the still form . ) He 's fainted , God help him ! ( He gets a tin dipper from the bucket and bathes Yank 's forehead with the water . Yank shudders and opens his eyes . ) YANK  --  ( slowly ) I thought I was goin ' then . Wha ' did yuh wanta wake me up fur ? DRISCOLL  --  ( with forced gayety ) Is it wishful for heaven ye are ? YANK  --  ( gloomily ) Hell , I guess . DRISCOLL  --  ( crossing himself involuntarily ) For the love av the saints do n't be talkin ' loike that ! You 'd give a man the creeps . It 's chippin ' rust on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best av us . ( Yank does not answer , but closes his eyes wearily . The seaman who has been on lookout , Smitty , a young Englishman , comes in and takes off his dripping oilskins . While he is doing this the man whose turn at the wheel has been relieved enters . He is a dark burly fellow with a round stupid face . The Englishman steps softly over to Driscoll . The other crawls into a lower bunk. ) p. 12 SMITTY  --  ( whispering ) How 's Yank ? DRISCOLL  --  Betther . Ask him yourself . He 's awake . YANK  --  I 'm all right , Smitty . SMITTY  --  Glad to hear it , Yank . ( He crawls to an upper bunk and is soon asleep . ) IVAN  --  ( The stupid-faced seaman who came in after Smitty twists his head in the direction of the sick man . ) You feel gude , Jank ? YANK  --  ( wearily ) Yes , Ivan . IVAN  --  Dot 's gude . ( He rolls over on his side and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause broken only by snores  --  with a bitter laugh ) Good-by and good luck to the lot of you ! DRISCOLL  --  Is ut painin ' you again ? YANK  --  It hurts like hell  --  here . ( He points to the lower part of his chest on the left side . ) I guess my old pump 's busted . Ooohh ! ( A spasm of pain contracts his pale features . He presses his hand to his side and writhes on the thin mattress of his bunk . The perspiration stands out in beads on his forehead. ) p. 13 DRISCOLL  --  ( terrified ) Yank ! Yank ! What is ut ? ( jumping to his feet ) I 'll run for the captain . ( He starts for the doorway . ) YANK  --  ( sitting up in his bunk , frantic with fear ) Do n't leave me , Drisc ! For God 's sake , do n't leave me alone ! ( He leans over the side of his bunk and spits . Driscoll comes back to him . ) Blood ! Ugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gettin ' the captain . YANK  --  No , no , do n't leave me ! If yuh do I 'll git up and follow you . I ai n't no coward , but I 'm scared to stay here with all of them asleep and snorin ' . ( Driscoll , not knowing what to do , sits down on the bench beside him . He grows calmer and sinks back on the mattress . ) The captain ca n't do me no good , yuh know it yourself . The pain ai n't so bad now , but I thought it had me then . It was a buzz-saw cuttin ' into me . DRISCOLL  --  ( fiercely ) God blarst ut ! ( The captain and the second mate of the steamer enter the forecastle . The captain is an old man with gray mustache and whiskers . The mate is clean-shaven and middle-aged . Both are dressed in simple blue uniforms. ) p. 14 THE CAPTAIN  --  ( taking out his watch and feeling Yank 's pulse ) How do you feel now ? YANK  --  ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the pain in your chest ? YANK  --  It still hurts , sir , worse than ever . THE CAPTAIN  --  ( taking a thermometer from his pocket and putting it into Yank 's mouth ) Here . Be sure and keep this in under your tongue , not over it . THE SECOND MATE  --  ( after a pause ) Is n't this your watch on deck , Driscoll ? DRISCOLL  --  Yes , sorr , but Yank was fearin ' to be alone , and  --  THE CAPTAIN  --  That 's all right . DRISCOLL  --  Thank ye , sorr . THE CAPTAIN  --  ( stares at his watch for a moment or so ; then takes the thermometer from Yank 's mouth and goes to the lamp to read it . His expression grows very grave . He beckons the mate and Driscoll to the corner near the doorway . Yank watches them furtively . The captain speaks in a low voice to the mate . ) Way up , both of them . ( to Driscoll ) Has he been spitting blood again ? p. 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorr , but before that  --  THE CAPTAIN  --  A great deal ? DRISCOLL  --  Yes , sorr . THE CAPTAIN  --  He has n't eaten anything ? DRISCOLL  --  No , sorr . THE CAPTAIN  --  Did he drink that medicine I sent him ? DRISCOLL  --  Yes , sorr , but it did n't stay down . THE CAPTAIN  --  ( shaking his head ) I ca n't do anything else for him . It 's too serious for me . If this had only happened a week later we 'd be in Cardiff in time to  --  DRISCOLL  --  Plaze help him some way , sorr ! THE CAPTAIN  --  ( impatiently ) But , my good man , I 'm not a doctor . ( more kindly as he sees Driscoll 's grief ) You and he have been shipmates a long time ? DRISCOLL  --  Five years and more , sorr . THE CAPTAIN  --  I see . Well , do n't let him move . Keep him quiet and we 'll hope for the best . I 'll read the matter up and send him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( goes over to Yank ) Keep up your courage ! You 'll be better tomorrow . ( He breaks down lamely before Yank 's steady gaze . ) We 'll pull you through all right  --  and  --  hm  --  well  --  coming , Robinson ? Dammit ! ( He goes out hurriedly , followed by the mate. ) p. 16 DRISCOLL  --  ( trying to conceal his anxiety ) Did n't I tell you you was n't half as sick as you thought you was ? The Captain 'll have you out on deck cursin ' and swearin' ' loike a trooper before the week is out . YANK  --  Do n't lie , Drisc . I heard what he said , and if I did n't I c 'd tell by the way I feel . I know what 's goin ' to happen . I 'm goin ' to  --  ( He hesitates for a second  --  then resolutely ) I 'm goin ' to die , that 's what , and the sooner the better ! DRISCOLL  --  ( wildly ) No , and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not let you . YANK  --  It ai n't no use , Drisc . I ai n't got a chance , but I ai n't scared . Gim me a drink of water , will yuh , Drisc ? My throat 's burnin ' up . ( Driscoll brings the dipper full of water and supports his head while he drinks in great gulps . ) DRISCOLL  --  ( seeking vainly for some word of comfort ) Are ye feelin ' more aisy loike now ? YANK  --  Yes  --  now  --  when I know it 's all up . ( a pause ) You must n't take it so hard , Drisc . I was just thinkin ' it ai n't as bad as people think  --  dyin ' . I ai n't never took much stock in the truck them sky-pilots preach . I ai n't never had religion ; but I know whatever it is what comes after it ca n't be no worser'n this . I do n't like to leave you , Drisc , but  --  that 's all . p. 17 DRISCOLL  --  ( with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talkin ' . YANK  --  This sailor life ai n't much to cry about leavin '  --  just one ship after another , hard work , small pay , and bum grub ; and when we git into port , just a drunk endin ' up in a fight , and all your money gone , and then ship away again . Never meetin ' no nice people ; never gittin ' outa sailor town , hardly , in any port ; travelin ' all over the world and never seein ' none of it ; without no one to care whether you 're alive or dead . ( with a bitter smile ) There ai n't much in all that that 'd make yuh sorry to lose it , Drisc . DRISCOLL  --  ( gloomily ) It 's a hell av a life , the sea . YANK  --  ( musingly ) It must be great to stay on dry land all your life and have a farm with a house of your own with cows and pigs and chickens , ' way in the middle of the land where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It must be great to have a wife , and kids to play with at night after supper when your work was done . It must be great to have a home of your own , Drisc . DRISCOLL  --  ( with a great sigh ) It must , surely ; but what 's the use av thinkin ' av ut ? Such things are not for the loikes av us. p. 18 YANK  --  Sea-farin ' is all right when you 're young and do n't care , but we ai n't chickens no more , and somehow , I du n no , this last year has seemed rotten , and I 've had a hunch I 'd quit  --  with you , of course  --  and we 'd save our coin , and go to Canada or Argentine or some place and git a farm , just a small one , just enough to live on . I never told yuh this ' cause I thought you 'd laugh at me . DRISCOLL  --  ( enthusiastically ) Laugh at you , is ut ? When I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's a grand idea and we 'll be doin ' ut sure if you 'll stop your crazy notions  --  about  --  about bein ' so sick . YANK  --  ( sadly ) Too late . We shouldn'ta made this trip , and then  --  How 'd all the fog git in here ? DRISCOLL  --  Fog ? YANK  --  Everything looks misty . Must be my eyes gittin ' weak , I guess . What was we talkin ' of a minute ago ? Oh , yes , a farm . It 's too late . ( his mind wandering ) Argentine , did I say ? D'yuh remember the times we 've had in Buenos Aires ? The moving pictures in Barracas ? Some class to them , d'yuh remember ? DRISCOLL  --  ( with satisfaction ) I do that ; and so does the piany player . He 'll not be forgettin ' the black eye I gave him in a hurry . p. 19 YANK  --  Remember the time we was there on the beach and had to go to Tommy Moore 's boarding house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seaboots full of holes , and shipped us on a skys'l yarder round the Horn , and took two months ' pay for it . And the days we used to sit on the park benches along the Paseo Colon with the vigilantes lookin ' hard at us ? And the songs at the Sailor 's Opera where the guy played ragtime  --  d'yuh remember them ? DRISCOLL  --  I do , surely . YANK  --  And La Plata  --  phew , the stink of the hides ! I always liked Argentine  --  all except that booze , can . How drunk we used to git on that , remember ? DRISCOLL  --  Cud I forget ut ? My head pains me at the menshun av that divil 's brew . YANK  --  Remember the night I went crazy with the heat in Singapore ? And the time you was pinched by the cops in Port Said ? And the time we was both locked up in Sydney for fightin ' ? DRISCOLL  --  I do so . YANK  --  And that fight on the dock at Cape Town  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( hastily ) Do n't be thinkin ' av that now . ' T was past and gone . p. 20 YANK  --  D'yuh think He 'll hold it up agin me ? DRISCOLL  --  ( mystified ) Who 's that ? YANK  --  God . They say He sees everything . He must know it was done in fair fight , in self-defense , do n't yuh think ? DRISCOLL  --  Av course . Ye stabbed him , and be damned to him , for the skulkin ' swine he was , afther him tryin ' to stick you in the back , and you not suspectin . ' Let your conscience be aisy . I wisht I had nothin ' blacker than that on my sowl . I 'd not be afraid av the angel Gabriel himself . YANK  --  ( with a shudder ) I c 'd see him a minute ago with the blood spurtin ' out of his neck . Ugh ! DRISCOLL  --  The fever , ut is , that makes you see such things . Give no heed to ut . YANK  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up again me  --  God , I mean ? DRISCOLL  --  If there 's justice in hiven , no ! ( Yank seems comforted by this assurance . ) YANK  --  ( after a pause ) We wo n't reach Cardiff for a week at least . I 'll be buried at sea . p. 21 DRISCOLL  --  ( putting his hands over his ears ) Ssshh ! I wo n't listen to you . YANK  --  ( as if he had not heard him ) it 's as good a place as any other , I s'pose  --  only I always wanted to be buried on dry land . But what the hell 'll I care  --  then ? ( fretfully ) Why should it be a rotten night like this with that damned whistle blowin 's and people snorin ' all around ? I wish the stars was out , and the moon , too ; I c 'd lie out on deck and look at them , and it 'd make it easier to go  --  somehow . DRISCOLL  --  For the love av God do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's comin ' to me yuh can divvy up with the rest of the boys ; and you take my watch . It ai n't worth much , but it 's all I 've got . DRISCOLL  --  But have ye no relations at all to call your own ? YANK  --  No , not as I know of . One thing I forgot : You know Fanny the barmaid at the Red Stork in Cardiff ? DRISCOLL  --  Sure , and who does n't ? YANK  --  She 's been good to me . She tried to lend me half a crown when I was broke there last trip . Buy her the biggest box of candy yuh c'n find in Cardiff . ( breaking down  --  in a choking voice ) It 's hard to ship on this voyage I 'm goin ' on  --  alone ! ( Driscoll reaches out and grasps his hand . There is a pause , during which both fight to control themselves . ) My throat 's like a furnace . ( He gasps for air . ) Gim me a drink of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a dipper of water . ) I wish this was a pint of beer . Oooohh ! ( He chokes , his face convulsed with agony , his hands tearing at his shirt front . The dipper falls from his nerveless fingers. ) p. 22 DRISCOLL  --  For the love av God , what is ut , Yank ? YANK  --  ( speaking with tremendous difficulty ) S'long , Drisc ! ( He stares straight in front of him with eyes starting from their sockets . ) Who 's that ? DRISCOLL  --  Who ' What ? YANK  --  ( faintly ) A pretty lady dressed in black . ( His face twitches and his body writhes in a final spasm , then straightens out rigidly . ) DRISCOLL  --  ( pale with horror ) Yank ! Yank ! Say a word to me for the love av hiven ! ( He shrinks away from the bunk , making the sign of the cross . Then comes back and puts a trembling hand on Yank 's chest and bends closely over the body . ) COCKY  --  ( from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for arf a mo ' and give me a ' and ? DRISCOLL  --  ( with a great sob ) Yank ! ( He sinks down on his knees beside the bunk , his head on his hands . His lips move in some half-remembered prayer . ) COCKY  --  ( enters , his oilskins and sou'wester glistening with drops of water ) The fog 's lifted . ( Cocky sees Driscoll and stands staring at him with open mouth . Driscoll makes the sign of the cross again. ) p. 23 COCKY  --  ( mockingly ) Sayin ' ' is prayers ! ( He catches sight of the still figure in the bunk and an expression of awed understanding comes over his face . He takes off his dripping sou'wester and stands , scratching his head . ) COCKY  --  ( in a hushed whisper ) Gawd blimey !
