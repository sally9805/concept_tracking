txt I have recently received communications from citizens of Chicago that liquor is sold in this city on Sunday in violation of the state law . I referred these communications to the corporation counsel for an opinion as to what is the law in regard thereto . He advises me that the state law provides that " Whoever keeps open any tippling house or place where liquor is sold or given away upon the first day of the week , commonly called Sunday , shall be fined not exceeding $200 , " and that the city ordinance permitting , under certain restrictions , saloons or dram shops to not and can not nullify the state law . This being the law , as I am advised , and it being my duty as mayor to take care , so far as lies within my power , that the law is faithfully executed in the city , I hereby direct that saloons or dram shops shall comply with the law and close on Sunday . And the city collector is hereby ordered immediately to ? notify in writing all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dram shops that such persons must comply with the I requirements of the state law . Respectfully submitted , THE LAW Chapter 38 , section 250 , revised statutes of Illinois , says : Whoever keeps open any tippling house or place where liquor is sold or given away upon the first day of the week , commonly called Sunday , shall be fined not exceeding $200 . Section 260 says : Sunday shall include the time from midnight until midnight . THE TIME The enforcement of the law will begin next Saturday night at , midnight . Both selling and giving away of intoxicants will be prohibited from that time until midnight Sunday night .
