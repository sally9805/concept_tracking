txt // the members of all courts other than the Reichsgericht , a matter for the State legislation to decide . So far as the judges of the Reichsgericht are concerned , the matter is settled by the Reichsbeamtengesetz of March 31 , 1873 , ? 16 : " No imperial official shall , without the previous consent of the highest imperial authority , assume an additional office or additional employment to which a continuous remuneration is attached , or carry on a business . The same consent is required for the entry of an imperial official into the directorate , or into the administration or supervisory council of any company operated for gain . Such consent will not be granted , however , in so far as the position is directly or indirectly bound up with a reward . A concession once granted may be revoked at any time . " 1 Perhaps the strongest guarantee for the personal independence of the judiciary is found in that section of the law which declares that " no judge shall , against his will , be permanently or temporarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retired , except by judicial decision and on grounds and according to forms prescribed by law . " 2 If the State Administration of Justice , however , changes the organization of the courts , or defines anew the districts of the same , it may also provide for such involuntary transfers THE JUDICIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE EMPIRE 20I as the reorganization necessitates , or even for involuntary removals under grant of full salary . ' The conditions of the law requiring that removals , transfers , or retirements shall be made only by judicial decision , on legal grounds and according to legal forms , are not met when such action is based on ordinances of the ruler , or on decrees of the State Administration of Justice . There must be actual legislation , imperial or State , behind the transaction . On the other hand , it is apparent that such a matter should not be left exclusively to the discretion or good pleasure of the judiciary . Hence , in those States where no law on the subject exists , the judiciary can not take the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation must step in.2 This section of the **25;27;TOOLONG covers cases of removal as a disciplinary measure ( Enthebung ) , as well as mere removals with no disciplinary character ( Ent f ernung ) . The arbitrary ousting of a judge from his office by an administrative authority on the vague ground that " the interests of the service " require it ? which , as Laband observes , means " according to the pleasure of the administrative // board , " is made impossible . No mere considerations of policy can be set up as a justification for such a removal or retirement . While any change may be made with the consent of the judge , none can be made against it , save by orderly judicial process , based on law and not on ordinance . ' The judges are protected , therefore , from the arbitrary action of the State Administration of Justice , and , in all cases of disciplinary prosecution , have a. claim to a legal hearing and to a judicial decision . No norm is laid down by imperial legislation , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor is there any uniform regulation of the disciplinary law touching judicial officers . Not even the most general principles are laid down by imperial legislation determining the grounds on which suspension , removal , or dismissal may be permissible , establishing the rules of disciplinary procedure or fixing the constitution and composition of the disciplinary boards . In all these matters the autonomy of the several States is practically unrestricted , being bound only by the formal limitation that action shall follow the way of legislation , not that of mere arbitrary decree or ordinance . ' The members of the Reichsgericht occupy a different position from that held by the other judges , so far as their relation to the disciplinary laws of the States is concerned . A temporary suspension from office takes place , according to law , when a member of the Reichsgericht is arrested pending investigation , and continues during the period of such detention . Moreover , a member may be temporarily suspended from office by the full bench of the Reichsgericht , after hearing the attorney for the Empire , if trial has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such member on a criminal charge . ' The removal of a member , together with loss of salary , may be effected by a pronouncement ' of the full bench of the Reichsgericht , the attorney for the Empire having been heard , if such member has been sentenced to punishment for a disgraceful act , or to imprisonment for more than a year . ' If a member of the Reichsgericht , because of bodily infirmity or weakness of physical or mental power , becomes permanently incapacitates for office , but nevertheless does not apply for a retirement , nor though requested to do so , sees fit to comply within a speci feed period , such member may , after both he and the attorney for the Empire have had a hearing , be retired by the action of the full bench of the Reichsgericht-3 CHAPTER X ALSACE-LORRAINE AND ITS RELATION TO THE EMPIRE IN the Peace Preliminaries between the German Empire and France , on the 26 February , 1871 , the cession of AlsaceLorraine definitely fixed the international status of that territory and determined its relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cl. 1 , of the Peace Preliminaries declares that " France renounces , in favor of the German Empire , all her rights and title to the territory lying east of a boundary line hereafter designated . " Clause 2 fixes the lines referred to , while Cl. 3 adds : " The German Empire shall possess this territory forever , in full sovereignty and with all the rights of ownership . " By this act all the interests of France in Alsace-Lorraine passed to Germany , and the actual possession of the territory effected by conquest in August , 1870 , was formally recognized . The settlement of the question as to the status of AlsaceLorraine with respect to international law served merely to raise the question as to its status with respect to constitutional law . The terms of the Peace Preliminaries determined the relations of the territory to third Powers , but it did not , and could not , determine its relations to the German Empire . Here was a problem which touched the internal organization of the Empire . By the fortunes of war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repossessed ? of a considerable territory , for the disposition and administration of which the Imperial Constitution made no provision . The adjustment of the new fact to the theory of the Constitution , 204 // the mortising of the new acquisition into the old order of things , was the task laid upon German jurists and statesmen . In the solution of the problem , three ways were open : to erect the new territory into a State with powers and rights equal to those possessed by the other federated States ; to incorporate Alsace-Lorraine into the territory of one of the existing States ; or to hold it as a pure imperial territory ? not a State , but a territory under the sovereign control of the Empire and administered by organs of the imperial government , wholly independent of any and all of the federated States as such . ' At no time was the idea held , at least to any extent , of making Alsace-Lorraine the twenty-sixth State in the Union . Too many political objections stood in the way , though such a proceeding could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The third solution of the problem seemed to present the fewest number of difficulties , ? the retention of the territorial status , under the immediate control of the Empire . It was therefore chosen . For such a relationship , however , the Imperial Constitution made no provision . It recognized no part of the Empire which was immediately subject to the central authority or which was to be looked upon as simply the object of imperial powers . The Constitution , on the contrary , assumed that between the individual territories with their people and the imperial power , a State power was interposed , and that each State into which the territory of the Empire or its population was organized , was a subject of rights , a member of the Empire , and as such had a share in the Empire itself . ' It is evident that the theory upon which the federal organization of the German Empire is builded ? the theory of mediate government through the States ? could find no application to // Alsace-Lorraine unless that territory should be erected into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusively by the central authority ; where self-government and autonomy , in the sense in which these words apply to federated States , are wanting ; where the laws are not laws by the territory , but laws by the central government for the territory , the federal idea fails . This is precisely the situation in Alsace-Lorraine . The relation between the Empire and Alsace-Lorraine is not that of a federal government to one of its member States , but that of a unitary State toward one of its provinces . And this must always be the relation between a federal State and its territories . True , a territory may be granted large powers of self-government , but , unlike the powers of self-government exercised by a State under a federal form of government , these powers are not original , but derivative . The federal government gave and the federal government may take away . The German jurists and statesmen harbored no fond delusions with respect to the newly acquired territory and the Imperial Constitution . The Constitution did not extend to these annexed districts ex proprio vigore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was carried there expressly by imperial legislation . This fact is clearly recognized in the " Law concerning the Union of Alsace-Lorraine with the German Empire , " of 9 June , 1871.1 This law , after declaring that the land acquired from France by cession was forever united to the German Empire , fixed a date on which the Imperial Constitution should go into effect there . It says : " The Constitution of the German Empire shall go into effect in Alsace-Lorraine on 1 January , 1873.2 By order of // the Emperor , with the consent of the Bundesrat , individual parts of the Constitution may be introduced earlier . ' The amendments and additions which may be necessary require the consent of the Reichstag . Article 3 of the Imperial Constitution shall go into effect at once . " 2 In other words , " the Constitution was made for the States , not for the territories , " and it enters the territories only when carried there by federal law . Under the German system of federal government , the extension of the Constitution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illogical in the extreme , unless the territory were erected into a State or incorporated in the territory of one of the States already existent . The introduction of the Imperial Constitution into Alsace-Lorraine took the form of an imperial law . This law can be amended or repealed at any time without the consent of Alsace-Lorraine.3 The introduction of the Imperial Constitution into AlsaceLorraine did not simplify the relations of that territory , either with respect to the Empire or to the several States of the Union . Many difficulties have arisen in determining the exact position of Alsace-Lorraine and in administering the territory . A federal State which recognizes no part of its territory as existing in any form other than that of one of the federated States , acquires territory which is not a State at the time of its acquisition and which the central government has no intention of erecting into a State . The pivotal theory of the German federal system demands organization into States which shall serve as the medium through which the central government acts . Nevertheless , the new territory is administered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution , intended only for " States , " extends there , and in many respects the annexed territory is treated as if it were actually a " member of the Bund . " As a matter of fact , of course , Alsace-Lorraine is not a State , nor is it , like the Territories in the United States , a " State in the making . " " Neither with respect to the Empire , nor with respect to foreign States , is AlsaceLorraine an independent subject of sovereign rights , with constitutional powers and obligations . It is logically no State , but a part ( Bestandteil ) , an administrative district , of the Empire . . . . The contrast between the territory and the member States of the Empire coincides exactly with the contrast between a decentralized unitary State and a federal State . " 1 A glance at the historical development of the organization of this acquired territory will serve to make its position in the Empire more clear . In considering the evolution of its territorial government five periods may be distinguished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The period of military dictatorship from August , 187o , to June , 1871 . This period must also be subdivided into two minor ones : ( a ) from the date of occupancy by the German troops , 14 August , 187o , to the cession of the territory by France to the German government , 26 February , 1871 ; ( b ) from . 26 February , 1871 , to the Law of Annexation , 9 June , 1871 , which went into effect 28 June , 1871. ( a ) During this time the government of Alsace-Lorraine was administered by a military governor-general , appointed by the king of Prussia , and acting , not in accordance with the principles of the North German Constitution , but with the principles of international law touching such cases . Alsace-Lorraine did not cease to be French territory through // the mere act of occupation by hostile troops and through the assumption of military control by the commanding officer of those troops . The power of France was suspended in the territory and French legislation for the territory was excluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the commander-in-chief of the German army , or his appointee , had the right to exercise the authority usually exercised by the State , subject only to the limitations fixed by international usage . ' Nor was the occupied territory , during the war , subjected to the German State , the Empire , which was erected only on r January , 1871 . It was simply in the military power of the allied German forces . " In the invested districts , therefore , the king of Prussia , as commander-in-chief of the German forces , exercised authority based not on constitutional law , but on international law . So far as the government of this French territory was concerned , he did not exercise the power of the German State , but of the French State . Hence the ordinances issued during the occupation are to be regarded , not as acts of the German Empire , but as acts of the German commander-in-chief , carried out in place of the French sovereignty at that time suspended . " 2 ( b ) On the conclusion of peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the governmental organization of the ceded districts . The government of Alsace-Lorraine was , however , put upon a different legal foundation . It no longer rested upon a military basis , but upon a legal basis created by the transfer of the territory , 2I0 THE GERMAN EMPIRE with all rights and title therein , by treaty to Germany . Through this treaty the status of Alsace-Lorraine with respect to third Powers was definitely fixed . Its status with respect to the Empire was a matter of German constitutional law . By the terms of the treaty Alsace-Lorraine did not become a State , nor was it even incorporated into the German system of States . Prior to the conclusion of the treaty it had been simply an integral part of a unitary State . The mere act of signing the treaty did not give it a character which it did not possess before . The sovereignty of France was exchanged for the sovereignty of Germany , but Alsace-Lorraine was not raised thereby from a province to a State . The government which had been temporarily set up during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peace , until , on 28 June , 1871 , AlsaceLorraine became formally annexed to the German Empire by imperial legislation . 2 . The second period , from 28 June , 1871 , to 31 December , 1873 , may be termed the period of imperial dictatorship , or the dictatorship of the Kaiser . The key to this period is furnished by the Law of 9 June , 1871 , ? the Law of Annexation . By the terms of the Peace Preliminaries , 26 February , 1871 , the full sovereignty over the ceded territory , as that term is understood both in international and constitutional law , passed to the German Empire . The Peace Preliminaries could not determine the relations of the ceded territory to the Empire except so far as those relations fell within the scope of international law . The Law of 9 June , 1871 , did not determine the position of Alsace-Lorraine in the Empire in explicit terms which gave no room for dispute . The law is silent upon the direct question of the status of the new territory with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen , Alsace-Lorraine was no State prior to the ALSACE-LORRAINE : ITS RELATION TO THE EMPIRE 2II cession , it could scarcely be assumed that the bare act of cession gave to this territory , ipso facto , a constitutional character which it did not before possess . By the transfer of sovereignty from France to Germany , Alsace-Lorraine did not become the subject o j new powers , but it became subjected to a new power , which possessed the sole right , at its own discretion , to determine what the organization and status of the territory should be . It became subject to imperial authority . Whatever governmental powers are exercised in Alsace-Lorraine are imperial powers , rooted in the sovereignty of the Empire and derived from it . In this respect , Alsace-Lorraine stands upon a footing wholly different from that upon which the several States of the Empire rest . The relation of Alsace-Lorraine to the Empire after its annexation was precisely that which it bore to France before annexation . That is , the relation was not federal in its nature , but unitary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alsace-Lorraine did not become a member of the Empire , for the members of the Empire are States , and AlsaceLorraine was not a State . It became possessed of none of the rights belonging to the several States and growing out of their membership in the Empire . The fact that the Law of Annexation fixed also a date at which the Imperial Constitution should go into effect in the acquired territory , showed conclusively that the Constitution did not extend to the annexed districts ex proprio vigore , and that such rights as did exist were rights based on law , not on the Constitution ; were rights granted , not reserved . The first clause of ? 3 of the Law of 9 June , 1871 , declares the State-power in Alsace-Lorraine shall be exercised by the Kaiser . Under this provision the government of Alsace-Lorraine immediately took on a strongly monarchistic aspect . The power , both legislative and executive , 2I2 THE GERMAN EMPIRE was concentrated in the hands of the Kaiser . It must be borne in mind , however , that as wielder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all in his own name or in his own right . The power was delegated power , and the Kaiser exercised it solely as an organ of the Empire . Alsace-Lorraine was imperial territory , and whatever authority was exercised there was imperial authority , carried into effect by imperial organs . The Kaiser is not the ruler of Alsace-Lorraine , in the sense in which he is ruler of Prussia , nor is Alsace-Lorraine in a " Personalunion " with the Prussian State . ' The Kaiser is simply an imperial organ , exercising imperial power , in an imperial territory . In centralizing the legislative and administrative powers in Alsace-Lorraine in the hands of the Kaiser , the Law of 9 June placed certain limitations or checks upon its exercise . These limitations were operative both in the sphere of administration and legislation . Thus , for example , Cl. 2 of ? 3 says : " Up to the time when the Imperial Constitution shall go into effect , the Kaiser shall be bound by the consent of the Bundesrat in the exercise of the legislative power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of guarantees for Alsace and Lorraine , which shall involve any burden upon the Empire , he shall be bound by the consent of the Reichstag also . " Moreover , by the provisions of ? 4 of the law , " the ordinances and decrees of the Kaiser need for their validity the counter-signature of the // imperial Chancellor , who assumes thereby the responsibility . " The Imperial Chancellor became , through this provision , the sole , supreme head of the administration in the imperial territory in all branches , and with him , of course , the Chancery Office , with its various departments , became charged with the regulation of matters pertaining to the territorial administration . By the Law of 30 December , 1871 , ? 4,1 a new feature was added to the administrative organization of AlsaceLorraine , in the person of the president ( Oberpraesident ) , whom the law designates as the " highest administrative authority in Alsace-Lorraine , with his official seat in Strassburg . " Section 6 of the law assigned to this president a large sphere of activity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in addition to which the imperial Chancellor was " empowered to hand over to him , wholly or in part , the authority which was exercised by the ministers under the French laws still in force . " Moreover , ? 5 of the law grants to the president the supervision of the various administrative boards in the territory , as well as of the officials subordinate to them , together with the task of seeing that the laws and ordinances are executed and the administration properly carried on . The president , further , acted in the capacity of an administrative court in deciding differences arising between the boards subordinated to him and in passing upon complaints and decisions of inferior administrative authorities , or in submitting such complaints or decisions to the Imperial Chancellor . The president had under him , of course , such a number of counsellors and assistants of various sorts as the business laid upon him seemed to require . As to the legal position of the president , Laband says : // " He was occupying the constitutional position held by a minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had no power to act as the representative of the Imperial Chancellor ; he could countersign no ordinances of the Emperor ; he was bound to obey the instructions of the Imperial Chancellor relating to the administrative service , and stood under his supervision . The law , ? 4 , calls him the highest administrative authority in Alsace-Lorraine . He was not , however , the highest administrative authority of Alsace-Lorraine in any single department , but was subordinate , in every relation , to the Imperial Chancellor , as the actual head of the administration . . . . He was a higher instance for the whole internal administration ; he was competent for almost every ordinance which belonged , under the existing law , to the jurisdiction of the Ministry ; upon him was laid the fixing of the territorial budget , the preparation of the drafts of laws and ordinances , the communication of instructions and service-notices to the district presidents and other district authorities . But he was intrusted with the greater part of these functions only by an administrative order of the Imperial Chancellor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , as regards the Imperial Chancellor , he was not independent . As a result , the Chancery retained its full significance in all matters which were reserved by special ordinance to the jurisdiction of the Imperial Chancellor , or which , on account of their importance , must be brought to his knowledge and decision . There were , accordingly , two Ministries at the same time , the one superimposed upon the other : the presidency , whose advantage lay in its mastery of details and in its more accurate knowledge of local persons and relations , and the Imperial Chancery , whose advantage lay in its larger legal power and in its closer touch with the central // Boards of the Empire , as well as with the Bundesrat and Reichstag . " 1 On the 27 May , 1871 , the Bundesrat created a special committee for Alsace-Lorraine , which to-day forms the ninth of the Standing Committees of that body . Like the period of military dictatorship , the dictatorship of the Emperor was also a transition period , and was so intended . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which the strongly concentrated , monarchical form of organization in Alsace-Lorraine should give place to another arrangement , by the introduction of the Imperial Constitution into the territory . 3 . The third period extends from i January , 1874 , to 28 May , 1877 , at which time the Law of 2 May , 1877,2 went into effect . With the introduction of the Imperial Constitution into Alsace-Lorraine on i January , 1874 , in accordance with the provisions of the Law of 25 June , 1873,3 an essential change took place in the constitutional position of the Kaiser . The monarchical concentration of power in Alsace-Lorraine came to an end . The legislative power no longer lay in the hands of the Kaiser alone , with certain requirements as to the consent of the Bundesrat and Reichstag , but it passed to the hands of those organs which , under the Constitution , were competent to legislate in matters falling within the jurisdiction of the Empire as such , viz. the Bundesrat and Reichstag . The power of the Kaiser was no longer dictatorial . It dwindled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the introduction of the Constitution , the right of the Kaiser to sanction the laws vanished , and his veto power , which he had possessed in the second period , disappeared also . From this // time on , the sanction of the laws lay in the hands of the Bundesrat alone . ' The Kaiser retained one right , however , which was not conferred upon him by the Imperial Constitution . This right is set forth in the Law of 25 June , 1873 , ? 8 : " Even after the introduction of the Imperial Constitution , and until such time as the matter shall be otherwise regulated by law , the Kaiser may , with the consent of the Bundesrat , and while the Reichstag is not in session , issue ordinances which shall have the force of law . " Such ordinances could not conflict with the Constitution or with the imperial laws in force at the time , they could be issued while the Reichstag was not in session , and must be laid before that body at its next session for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the election of fifteen members to the Reichstag from Alsace-Lorraine . So far as legislative competence is concerned , the introduction of the Imperial Constitution into Alsace-Lorraine removed the line of division which had split the general territory of the Empire into two spheres of legislation . The general legislation of the Empire extended to all the affairs of the new imperial territory , not only to those matters which fall within the general competence of the Empire , but also to those which , in the several States , are reserved for State legislation . No line of demarcation was drawn between the legislative competence of the Empire and the legislative competence of the territory . For in the imperial territory there existed no power but imperial power , and hence there was no lawgiver for Alsace-Lorraine save the Empire itself . As the Law of 9 June , 1871 , ? 3 , Cl. 4 , says , " After the introduction of the Imperial Constitution , until such time as the matter is otherwise regulated by impe- // rial law , the power of legislation , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not subjected to the legislative authority of the Empire , shall belong to the Empire . " No limitation , therefore , such as was laid upon the legislative action of the Empire with respect to the individual States , bound it with respect to Alsace-Lorraine . No change was wrought in the administrative organization of Alsace-Lorraine by the introduction of the Imperial Constitution . On the 29 October , 1874 , however , the Kaiser issued a decree 1 having for its subject-matter the erection of an advisory Territorial Committee for Alsace-Lorraine . By the provisions of this decree , the Imperial Chancellor was authorized to construct a Territorial Committee by calling upon the three District Assemblies ? Upper Alsace , Lower Alsace , and Lorraine , ? each to elect ten of their number , as well as three substitutes , to serve on the committee . The term was fixed at three years , but should a member lose his seat in the District Assembly in the meanwhile , his membership in the committee also lapsed . The sessions of the committee were not to be public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and place of its meeting . As the opening paragraph of the decree explained , the purpose for which the committee was created was to give expert advice on such drafts of laws as might be laid before it , touching matters concerning Alsace-Lorraine , which were not reserved by the Imperial Constitution to the legislation of the Empire . The territorial budget was submitted to this committee . Bills to be presented to this committee were brought to its notice by the president ( Oberpraesident ) , who was authorized to attend its meetings either in person or by representative . The president , or his representative , // must be heard at any time upon their request . The advice of the committee was had before a bill was laid before the competent legislative bodies for final determination . It should be noted , however , that this securing of the advice of the Territorial Committee was purely permissory . It was not obligatory . The competence of the Committee was merely advisory and in no degree legislative . As Laband puts it : " This decree has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has primarily the significance of an instruction merely . Even without the decree , the government would not have been restrained from securing expert advice on drafts of laws , and on the other hand , the obtaining of such advice was not raised to the character of a legal requirement in territorial legislation . " 1 It is very evident , however , that the creation of such a committee , even though it possessed no legal powers , served to strengthen the position of the president . 4 . The fourth period begins with the Law of 2 May , 1877,2 which marks a significant step toward a larger degree of independence on the part of Alsace-Lorraine , particularly in legislative matters . By the provisions of this law , the Territorial Committee , which up to this time had possessed advisory powers only , became a fixed and important factor in the legislation of the territory . " Territorial laws for Alsace-Lorraine , including the annual territorial budget , shall issue from the Kaiser , with the consent of the Bundesrat , when the Territorial Committee , erected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1874 , shall have consented to the same . " ' // Several things should be noted with respect to the Law of 2 May , 1877 . In the first place , a distinction , hitherto nonexistent , is drawn between imperial competence and territorial competence in territorial legislation . Perhaps it were more accurate to say that two distinct fields were recognized in which the legislative power of Alsace-Lorraine operated . The passage of the Law of 2 May , 1877 , did not in any wise affect Cl. 4 of ? 3 of the Law of 9 June , 1871 , which declared that after the introduction of the Imperial Constitution into Alsace-Lorraine , the legislative power in that territory , even in matters which , in the several States , did not fall within the competence of the Empire , belonged to the Empire , until otherwise provided for by imperial law . For ? 2 of the Law of 2 May , 1877 , expressly states that the issuance of territorial laws in the form of imperial legislation is reserved . The competence of the Empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . A form of legislation is , however , introduced , other than that provided for by the Imperial Constitution , in matters affecting the territory . Laws passed by the regular legislative factors of the Empire , for the Empire at large , would extend also to Alsace-Lorraine ; but , by the terms of the Law of 2 May , 1877 , a line of demarcation was drawn between the affairs of the Empire in general and those of Alsace-Lorraine in particular . No change was effected in the State-power operating in the territory . It was still the power of the Empire alone . But under the new juristic character of the Territorial Committee , a distinction arose between the laws touching the internal affairs of Alsace-Lorraine , and those concerning the Empire as a whole , and , therefore , concerning Alsace-Lorraine as a part of that whole . In other words , a distinction was made between laws made in Alsace-Lorraine , and laws made simply for Alsace-Lorraine . As to the nature of these laws , Laband // has this to say : 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws , i.e. laws sanctioned by the Empire . Territorial laws for Alsace-Lorraine are provincial laws of the Empire for Alsace-Lorraine , in matters which , so far as the rest of the Empire is concerned , are excluded by the Imperial Constitution from the competence of the Empire . For territorial laws of this sort , the Law of 2 May , 1877 , prescribes a special form , but , so far as the nature and constitutional significance of those laws are concerned , they are not , like the laws of the several States , an expression of autonomy , but a manifestation of imperial power . Autonomy ' does not consist of a peculiar form in which laws come into being , but in the independent right to issue laws . Such a right presumes a subject to whom it belongs . In the imperial territory such a subject is wanting . " All laws for AlsaceLorraine , therefore , are imperial laws , but , under the Law of 2 May , 1877 , two ways are provided by which they may be issued : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way up to the passage of the Law of 2 May , 1877 ; and , secondly , the method set forth in ? i of that law , already noted above . This latter method became the regular mode of legislating for the territory , while the ordinary method of imperial legislation was merely a right reserved by the Empire for exceptional use 2 The new mode of legislation introduced by the Law of ALSACE ? LORRAINE : ITS RELATION TO HIE EMPIRE 22I 2 May , 1877 , deviated from the ordinary method of imperial legislation in several particulars . The consent of the Reichstag was no longer necessary even in matters pertaining to the territorial budget . In its place stood the Territorial Committee , a body elected out of the territory itself , thus giving Alsace-Lorraine a positive voice in territorial legislation . The factors of territorial legislation now were the Kaiser , the Bundesrat , and the Territorial Committee . Another deviation manifested itself in the role played by the Kaiser in territorial legislation . Prior to the Law of 2 May , 1877 , following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alsace-Lorraine were sanctioned by the Bundesrat in accordance with Art . 7 of the Imperial Constitution . Under the provisions of ? 1 of the Law of May 2 , 1877 , legislation was not had , as stipulated by Art . 5 of the Imperial Constitution , through the Bundesrat and Reichstag , but through the Kaiser , with the consent of the Bundesrat and Territorial Committee . The territorial laws were sanctioned by the Kaiser , just as they had been sanctioned by him under the Law of 9 June , 1871 , while the Bundesrat , no longer the lawgiver proper , was reduced to the level of the Territorial Committee , ? a body whose consent is necessary to the issuance of a law by the Emperor , but whose determinations the Kaiser was not bound to engross and publish . ' While the Law of 2 May , 1877 , did not affect the administrative organization of the imperial territory , certain changes which were taking place in the Imperial Chancery // were making themselves felt in Alsace-Lorraine . The Imperial Chancery began , in 1873 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of one general office which had developed under the Imperial Chancellor , into separate " Departments , " with a State secretary at the head of each . ' On 1 January , 1877 , " Division III. , " which had been occupied with the affairs of Alsace-Lorraine , became a separate Department , known as the " Imperial Chancery Department for Alsace-Lorraine . " At the same time " Division IV . " was raised to the " Imperial Department of Justice . " Each of these Departments had a Secretary of State at its head . On 17 March , 1872,2 a law was passed enabling the Imperial Chancellor to appoint a substitute , or deputy , who might sign for him and assume other responsibilities imposed upon the Imperial Chancellor by the Imperial Constitution or by law . The heads of the Departments , moreover , were made competent to act as such deputies within the jurisdiction of the Department of which they were chief . As a result of this law , a new instance , so far as the administrative affairs of the territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the president . This complicated the position of the president very considerably . " The three instances which had been created under the laws of the territory and of the Empire , had become five . Furthermore , the Departments of Administration and of Justice were torn apart and assigned to two entirely distinct and separate Boards . " In order to remove the difficulties arising out of this state of affairs , a law was passed 4 July , 1879 , ' with the going into effect of which , on i October , 1879 , begins the 5 . Fifth period in the development of the territorial or- // ganization , the system under which Alsace-Lorraine is at present governed . The changes made by this law were sweeping . The administration of the imperial territory was wholly revolutionized . It was entirely dissociated from the person of the Imperial Chancellor , the Department of the Imperial Chancery for Alsace-Lorraine was abolished , together with the office of president , and the seat of all the governmental organs of the territory was transferred to the territory itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alsace-Lorraine as well as of the Department of Justice , so far as they touched territorial matters , and in order to perform the duties which had been laid upon the president , a board was erected in Strassburg , under the name of " Ministry for Alsace-Lorraine , " with a Secretary of State at its head . ' The Law of 4 July , 1879 , made no change in the relation of the Emperor to the territory . On the other hand , the transfer of the seat of the central administrative authorities from Berlin to Strassburg made a severing of the relations between those authorities and the Imperial Chancellor necessary , if the evils which the law was designed to correct were to be eliminated . Accordingly , ? 1 of the law empowers the Kaiser to transfer the authority vested in him as " Delegatar " of the State-power , in Alsace-Lorraine , to an - official to be known as the " Statthalter , " who should be appointed and , if needs be , dismissed by the Kaiser , and who should have his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority to be thus delegated to the Statthalter was to be determined by ordinance of the Kaiser.2 Upon // the Statthalter were to rest also all those powers and duties which had been conferred by law or ordinance upon the Imperial Chancellor in matters pertaining to Alsace-Lorraine , as well as the extraordinary powers assigned to the president by the Law of 30 December , 1871.1 At the same time the number of members in the Territorial Committee was increased and its powers enlarged . A Council of State was added to the organization of the territory , with advisory powers , while the competence of the Bundesrat was restricted by the transfer of certain powers heretofore exercised by that body to the new ministry . The institutions of the imperial territory , as at present organized , are the following : The Kaiser. ? While the State-power in Alsace-Lorraine rests in the Empire , the exercise of that power is placed in the hands of the Kaiser . The legal title by which the Kaiser exercises that power is the Law of 9 June , 1871 . The Kaiser is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sense in which the king of Bavaria is monarch of Bavaria , for example . Alsace-Lorraine is not an appurtenance of the imperial crown . Whatever authority is exercised by the Kaiser , in the territory , is exercised by him " in the name of the Empire , " never in his own name . ' The " Landesherr " of Alsace-Lorraine is the Empire . The Kaiser is the " Delegatar " of the Empire . 2 . The Stalthalter , or Imperial Deputy . ? The legal title of the Statthaltcr rests upon the Law of 4 July , 1879 , ? ? 1 and 2 . He is appointed by the Kaiser and is removable by // him . The appointment is countersigned by the Imperial Chancellor , ' as is also the ordinance transferring to him the powers of the Emperor . The Statthalter acts in two capacities : ( a ) He is the personal representative of the Kaiser , when the Kaiser sees fit to invest him with the powers exercised by himself in the imperial territory . The Kaiser is not bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is purely optional with him . But when the Statt halter has been invested with the governmental powers of the Kaiser in Alsace-Lorraine , he becomes , until such time as these powers may be resumed by the Kaiser , the vice-Kaiser . The powers thus transferred by the Kaiser attach to the person of the Statthalter , not to the office . Hence , when the Statthalter is hindered in the exercise of his imposed duties , these functions revert to the Kaiser . When acting as the representative of the Kaiser , the Statthalter stands in a position similar to that of a ruler , and is , therefore , not responsible constitutionally nor is his relation a disciplinary one . He is , of course , responsible to the Kaiser for the proper fulfilment of his duties . The decrees and ordinances issued by the Statthalter in his capacity as representative of the Kaiser have the same force as imperial ordinances and decrees , and require for their validity the countersignature of the Secretary of State , who thereby assumes the responsibility therefor ' ( b ) The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal position in Alsace-Lorraine which was occupied earlier by the Imperial Chancellor and the president . ' As Q // an imperial official the Statthalter is not merely a deputy of the Imperial Chancellor within the meaning of the " Law respecting the Appointment of Deputies for the Imperial Chancellor . " 1 " The Statthalter takes the place of the Imperial Chancellor , not as his Delegatar , but as his successor . The competence of the Imperial Chancellor was divided into two spheres by the Law of 4 July , 1879 : the competence in general affairs of the Empire , and the competence in matters pertaining to the imperial territory . The latter has been taken away from the Imperial Chancellor and handed over to the Statthalter . The principle of the Imperial Constitution that there is but one Imperial Minister has been changed by the Law of 1879 . Since then there have been two : the Statthalter is the Imperial Chancellor for Alsace-Lorraine , just as the Territorial Committee is the Reichstag for Alsace-Lorraine. " 2 While acting in the capacity of an imperial official , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chancellor , as provided in the Law of 1879 , 2 , the Statthalter is responsible . He is responsible , however , not to the Territorial Committee , but to the Reichstag , at least in theory . In practice , nevertheless , his responsibility would seem to be directed to the Territorial Committee . " The Statt halter has no relations whatever with the Reichstag , while the Territorial Committee , in fixing the budget , auditing the accounts , and discussing measures , petitions , etc. , is in a position to criticise the action of the government , and to it alone can the government justify its acts and establish its propositions . " Theoretically , the // Statthalter should countersign the ordinances of the Emperor touching the territorial affairs of Alsace-Lorraine , that is , touching those matters which in the division of powers under the Imperial Constitution would fall within the competence of the several States . ' Here again theory and practice do not coincide . A law affecting the territorial affairs of AlsaceLorraine , passed , under the reservation contained in ? 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1877 , by the legislative organs of the Empire , is signed by the Statthalter and Imperial Chancellor , the latter assuming the responsibility and the supervision of the law 's execution . ' In all those matters indicated in ? 2 of the Law of 4 July , 1879 , i.e. in all matters wherein the Statthalter acts as an imperial official and as the successor of the Imperial Chancellor , the State Secretary has the rights and responsibility of a deputy of the Statthalter , to that degree in which , under the Law of 17 March , 1878 , such rights and responsibility are possessed by the deputy of the Imperial Chancellor . The right of the Statthalter himself to perform any official function which falls within this sphere is reserved . ' 3 . The Ministry in Alsace-Lorraine , no longer located in Berlin as a division of the Imperial Chancery , but , as already noted , transferred to Strassburg , still maintains the character of an imperial board , equally with the other imperial Depart , ments , such as the Department of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under the Imperial Chancellor , but under the Statthalter . At the head of the ministry is a // State Secretary , who , as noted in the preceding paragraph , in matters where the Statthalter acts as the successor of the Imperial Chancellor , stands to that official as the deputy of the Imperial Chancellor , under the Law of 17 March , 1878 , stands to his chief . The ministry falls into various divisions , at the head of each of which is placed an Under Secretary of State . Both the State Secretary and the Under Secretaries arc appointed by the Kaiser . These appointments are countersigned by the Statthalter , to whom is assigned the appointment of the other high ministerial officials . ' The details of the organization of the ministry are fixed by ordinance of the Kaiser . ' The activities of the ministry extend to all the duties laid upon the former Imperial Chancery Office for Alsace-Lorraine and upon the Imperial Judicial Office for the administration of Alsace-Lorraine , as well as to those duties which fell to the president prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , together with such further enlargement of competence as may have been granted since by territorial legislation . ' From the ministry proceed the various administrative and judicial institutions of the territory , with the exception of those which are concerned with matters such as the post and telegraph , imperial railroads , and the Imperial Bank , which belong to the competence of the Empire , and military matters , which are administered by Prussia . ' // 4 . By the terms of ? 9 of the Law of 4 July , 1879 , a Council of State was created , consisting of the State Secretary , the Under Secretaries , the President of the Supreme Court of the territory , the Chief Attorney attached to the Supreme Court , and from eight to twelve members appointed by the Kaiser for a term of three years . Three of these members to be appointed by the Kaiser are nominated by the Territorial Committee . The meetings of the Council of State are presided over by the Statthalter , and in case he be hindered , by the State Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely advisory in their nature , and in no sense legislative or judicial . ' It is called upon to give an opinion on the drafts of all proposed laws and of general ordinances issued for the execution of the laws , as well as on matters which may be submitted to it by the Statthalter . The Law of 4 July , 1879 , requires that all laws and general ordinances , without exception , shall be laid before the Council of State . Should such submission of a law or ordinance to the Council of State be neglected , the omission would in no wise affect the validity of the measure . ' The Council of State is no innovation in the organization of Alsace-Lorraine . It was rather the revival of an institution long and favorably known there ? the Conseil d'J tat , whose functions seemed specially needed in the peculiar conditions existing in Alsace-Lorraine . ' " It will hardly be doubted , " say the Motiven to ? 9 of the Law of 4 July , 1879 , " that a comprehensive and thorough consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legislative factors is better secured , if the preparation of those // propositions is not left to the individual ministerial departments alone , but is handed over for discussion to a body in which a knowledge of law and of business , an insight into the needs of the territory , and an assured position in life removed as far as possible from the struggles of political parties are combined . The initiative and preliminary draft would naturally fall to the minister of the department concerned , as a rule , but the necessary testing as to whether the law would be useful and practicable , whether it harmonizes with existing legislation , what reaction it might have upon interests of the territory administered by other departments , and , finally , whether the idea has come to the desired expression in the wording of the law , ? these go beyond the scope of the individual department . " 5 . The Bundesrat is an organ of the legislative power in Alsace-Lorraine . According to the Law of 2 May , 1877 , ? ? 1 and 2 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 July , 1879 , ? laws for Alsace-Lorraine are issued by the Kaiser with the consent of the Bundesrat , provided the consent of the Territorial Committee has been obtained to the desired measure . It is expressly provided , however , that the power to legislate for the imperial territory through the usual organs of imperial legislation is specially reserved . Like laws of the Empire , therefore , the territorial laws of AlsaceLorraine need for their validity the consent of the Bundesrat . It must not be inferred , however , that the position of the Bundesrat is the same in both modes of legislation . According to Art . 5 of the Imperial Constitution , the legislative power of the Empire is exercised by the Bundesrat and Reichstag , and the consent of a majority in both bodies is necessary and sufficient . Such consent being had , the Kaiser is bound to engross and publish the law . ' The pre- // vailing view is that the Bundesrat is the organ in the Empire in which legislative power rests , from which the command in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigned . In the legislation of Alsace-Lorraine , on the contrary , i.e. in territorial legislation , the " placet " belongs to the Kaiser . He it is who , as bearer of the State-power in AlsaceLorraine , exercises the legislative power , as ? i of the Law of 2 May , 1877 , explicitly declares . In territorial legislation , therefore , the Bundesrat has no authority other than that possessed also by the Territorial Committee . The requirement of its consent in territorial legislation is a constitutional check upon the power of the Kaiser . Its functions are those of a parliamentary body , or " Upper House . " The cooperation of the Bundesrat , moreover , is necessary in certain administrative business . The government is bound to lay the accounts of the territorial budget before the Bundesrat , from which body the discharge issues.2 The compulsory retirement ? pensioning ? of an official who has become permanently incapacitated , by reason of bodily infirmity or on account of physical or mental weakness , for the fulfilment of his duties , can , in case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered by the Kaiser only with the consent of the Bundesrat . ' Ordinances of the Kaiser respecting the erection of disciplinary chambers and the delineation of disciplinary districts , are to issue with the consent of the // Bundesrat . Moreover , the Bundesrat selects the members of the disciplinary chambers , and the order of business in the disciplinary boards is subjected to its approval . ' 6 . The Territorial Committee , like the whole constitution of Alsace-Lorraine , is a creation of imperial law . An imperial law called it into being , and so long as the Empire reserves to itself the power to give a constitution to Alsace-Lorraine , an imperial law may wipe it out of existence . In this respect a sharp distinction is drawn between the Territorial Committee and the Landtag , or Chambers , of the several German States . Moreover , a further difference is found in the fact that the powers usually exercised by the Assemblies of the States are not exercised by the Territorial Committee alone and exclusively , but are granted to the Reichstag also by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a result , the cooperation of the Territorial Committee in territorial legislation is not a necessary one , but an optional one . The Territorial Committee is not an integral part of the constitutional structure of the territory , like the Assemblies of the States , since it can be put out of operation with no amendment of the Constitution , at the good pleasure of the government . ' On the other hand , the legal position of the Territorial Committee is not identical with that of a Provincial Assembly . It has , under the law , a full right of cooperation in legislation and in fixing the budget . It exercises all the rights which usually pertain to the representative body in a constitutional State . The territory is not a State , and can , for that reason , have no State organs . The powers of the // Territorial Committee are derived wholly from the Empire , and its whole existence rests , as already stated , upon imperial legislation . It is therefore an organ of the Empire , or , to use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which functions in the affairs of Alsace-Lorraine in place of the regular Reichstag . " It does not represent a " people of Alsace-Lorraine . " It is " the constitutional representative of the German people of the Empire so far as that people is domiciled in Alsace-Lorraine , and interested for that reason in the special affairs of the territory . It is accordingly , in contrast with the Reichstag , a special representative of the population of Alsace-Lorraine , but just as the Reichstag is , so is it also , an organ of the Empire . " The Territorial Committee is composed of fifty-eight members , thirty-four of whom are elected by the District Assemblies out of their own midst , ' four are chosen by the Communal Councils of the cities of Strassburg , Kolmar , Metz , and Mulhausen , one from each city , ' and twenty chosen by indirect ballot from the various Circles into which the territory is divided . ' The Kaiser has the exclusive right to call , adjourn , // and dissolve the Territorial Committee . ' The ministers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the transaction of business by the Territorial Committee , and , on their own request , must be heard at any time . ' The general provisions of the imperial law protecting the members of representative bodies apply also to the members of the Territorial Committee . ' The special provisions , however , which concern the members of the Reichstag particularly , have no application . ' LEGISLATION IN ALSACE-LORRAINE In Alsace-Lorraine laws may come into being in any one of three ways : ( I ) through the decree of the Kaiser with the consent of the Bundesrat and Territorial Committee ; ( 2 ) through the decree of the Kaiser with the consent of the Bundesrat and Reichstag ; and ( 3 ) through the decree of the Kaiser with the consent of the Bundesrat , in the form , that is , of an ordinance having the provisory force of law . The first method is the one generally employed . ( I ) In legislation with respect to matters pertaining to Alsace-Lorraine , in what may be termed territorial legislation , in other words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also to the Bundesrat and Territorial Committee . ' Before a bill is submitted to the action of the legis- // lative bodies , it is laid before the Council of State for its expert opinion , and then is introduced into the Bundesrat . From the Bundesrat it passes to the Territorial Committee . The result of the deliberation in the Bundesrat is communicated to the Statthalter by the president of the Bundesrat , while the action of the Territorial Committee is brought to the knowledge of the government by the president of the committee . The government is not bound by the action of the Bundesrat or Territorial Committee , but may withdraw the measure at any time . Nor is there any period fixed within which the government , after the Bundesrat has acted upon a bill , must submit the bill to the Territorial Committee for its action or to the Kaiser for his sanction . Nothing stands legally in the way of submitting bills which have received the consent of the Bundesrat before the beginning of , or during , the session of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only , at a later session . ' Both Bundesrat and Territorial Committee may amend bills submitted to them . If , however , amendments are made in the Territorial Committee , no matter what the nature of the amendment may be , or how unimportant seemingly , the bill must be returned to the Bundesrat for its consent , since , as Leoni observes , " the activity of the Bundesrat may not at any time be made contingent upon the views of the government as to the importance or unimportance of the amendments . " When a bill is accepted by the Territorial Committee without alteration , a further action on the part of the Bundesrat , such as is both customary and necessary in imperial legislation , is not required , nor is it the practice in territorial legislation . The sanction of a law is imparted by the Kaiser , not , as in imperial legislation , by the Bundesrat . In territorial legis- // lation , the Bundesrat stands upon the same level with the Territorial Committee , possessing no authority which is not also possessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper lawgiver . Its consent is simply a condition to the issuance of a law on the part of the Emperor . " 1 In deciding whether a bill shall become actual law , the Kaiser is perfectly free to exercise his own discretion . He is not in any sense bound by the majority vote of the Bundesrat , ' nor does the fact that the bill has passed both legislative bodies lay upon him any legal obligation whatever to impart to that bill his sanction . Bills which have received the sanction of the Kaiser are engrossed by him ( ausgeferligt ) , countersigned by the Stallhalter , or by his representative , the State Secretary in AlsaceLorraine , and published in the Gazette for Alsace-Lorraine. ( 2 ) In ? 2 of the Law of 2 May , 1877 , the right of passing laws for Alsace-Lorraine in the way of ordinary imperial legislation is specially reserved . Under the provisions of this law , a measure affecting territorial matters in Alsace-Lorraine may be passed by the Bundesrat and Reichstag with the sanction of the Emperor , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in territorial affairs legislation may be had in the production of which the Territorial Committee is wholly ignored , and the ordinary legislative organs of the Empire alone are active . In such cases bills might arise in the Reichstag as well as in the Bundesrat , and such bills as would be passed in the way of imperial legislation would not be submitted to the Council of State for its opinion . Moreover , bills passed in the form of ordinary imperial legislation , though the subject of these measures be purely terri- // torial matters , do not lose thereby their character of imperial laws . ' The fact that matters pertaining to the imperial territory may be affected by legislation in two different modes might well lead to serious complications . It is not at all unthinkable that legislation which could not be had , for various reasons , with the cooperation of the Territorial Committee , might be had by a legislative circumlocution which would bring the matter directly before the legislative factors of the Empire with no reference whatever to the Territorial Committee . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a measure which , voted down in the Territorial Committee , was thereupon introduced into the Reichstag by the Bundesrat for adoption in the way of imperial legislation . What , now , is the relation of laws passed in the form of territorial legislation to those passed in the form of imperial legislation ? According to Art . 2 of the Imperial Constitution , imperial laws take precedence of State laws . The decisive fact is not the date of publication . The later law does not repeal the earlier . The principle is this : an expression of will on the part of a higher power supersedes an expression of will on the part of a subordinate power . In Alsace-Lorraine , however , there is but one State-power , ? the power of the Empire . Imperial laws for Alsace-Lorraine and territorial laws for Alsace-Lorraine passed in the way of imperial legislation are both expressions of the will of this one State-power . Here , accordingly , the principle would hold that the later law repealed the earlier . With respect to laws passed in the form // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Alsace-Lorraine , or territorial laws passed in the way of imperial legislation ? the principle does not apply , so far as the relation of such territorial legislation to imperial legislation is concerned . Laws passed in the form of territorial legislation , that is , laws issued by the Emperor with the consent of the Bundesrat and Territorial Committee , do not take precedence of imperial legislation touching the same subject , and can neither amend or repeal it . For , in ? 2 , Cl. 2 , of the Law of 2 May , 1877 , it is expressly declared that laws affecting territorial affairs , passed in the way of imperial legislation , can be amended or repealed only through imperial legislation . This clause corresponds to the legal relation between the legislative factors in both forms of legislation . An imperial law for Alsace-Lorraine , a law touching matters purely territorial passed in the form of imperial law , issues , like every imperial law , from the Bundesrat and Reichstag , or , to be more accurate , from the Bundesrat with the consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bundesrat . A law in Alsace-Lorraine passed in the form of territorial legislation issues from the Kaiser , with the consent of the Bundesrat , the consent of the Territorial Committee having been previously obtained . In the first case , the legislation for Alsace is immediate . In the second case , it is mediate . That is to say , in the first instance we have an immediate expression of the will of the State-power . In the second , we have a mediate expression of that will through the Kaiser , into whose hands the State-power , with the reservation contained in ? 2 of the Law of 2 May , 1877 , has been placed . The two forms of legislation , therefore , rest upon two distinct bases : the one upon original , the other upon derivative , power . Where , as in this case , the delegated power is limited by an express reservation , the exercise of the reserved power by the // imperial legislative body must take precedence of all action on the same subject by the " Delegatcir. " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June , 1873 , ? 8,1 the Kaiser is empowered , until such time as the matter may be regulated by imperial legislation , to issue , with the consent of the Bundesrat , ordinances having the force of law . ' In the exercise of this right the Kaiser is subjected to certain limitations . In the first place , such ordinances may contain nothing contrary to the Constitution or to the imperial laws in force in Alsace-Lorraine , nor may they relate to such matters as require , by the provisions of ? 3 , Cl. 2 , of the Law of 9 June , 187 the consent of the Reichstag for their determination . In the third place , such ordinances must be laid before the Reichstag , at its next meeting , for its action . Should ratification be refused by the Reichstag , the ordinance goes out of force . The assent of the Reichstag , on the other hand , raises the ordinance to the dignity of a law , which can not be amended or repealed by subsequent ordinance , but by law only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force of law may be exercised only while the Reichstag is not in session . The fact that the Territorial Committee may be in session has absolutely no effect . ' The Law of 7 July , 1887,6 provides that where an imperial law has been introduced into Alsace-Lorraine , and such law is subsequently amended , through imperial legislation , the amendment may be made effective in Alsace-Lorraine by . // ordinance of the Kaiser , with the consent of the Bundesrat , and the date from which such amendment shall go into force may be fixed in the ordinance . The power of the Kaiser to issue ordinances of this nature is not subjected to the provisions of ? 8 of the Law of 25 June , 1873 . These ordinances may be issued while the Reichstag is in session and need no subsequent ratification by that body . They are not in any sense provisional ? " Verordnungen mit interimistischer Gesetzeskra f t . " CHAPTER XI THE CONSTITUTION AND IMPERIAL FINANCE THE German Empire , like every other State , is a juristic person , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding , and disposing of property . ' As the subject of property rights , the Empire is known in German law as the Imperial Fiscus ? " Reichsfiskus. " 2 The Imperial Fiscus is not something different from the Empire , it is the Empire itself , viewed from the standpoint of private law . For , like every other State , the Empire is a juristic person possessed not only of certain public law capacities and relations , but also // of certain private law capacities and relations . It is with reference to the latter that one speaks of the Imperial Fiscus . As a subject of property rights , the Imperial Fiscus is a unit . It is not to be sharply differentiated from the various " Fisci " of the several administrative branches of the government , ? the Postal Fiscus , the Marine Fiscus , etc. , which are simply different modes in which the Imperial Fiscus distributes its activity ; but it stands over against the " State Fisci , " from which it is distinct and separate . The Fiscus in Alsace-Lorraine is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though the State-power in AlsaceLorraine belongs to the Empire , yet the financial administration of the territory is wholly severed from that of the Empire . ' Notwithstanding the fact that the Imperial Fiscus is distinct from the State Fisci , and that the financial administration of the States is separate from that of the Empire , it is not always a simple matter to define the competence of the Empire and that of the individual States so far as the relation of the Imperial Fiscus to the several State Fisci is concerned . That the Imperial Fiscus and the State Fisci should exist side by side , each operating within its own sphere , grows out of the very nature of a federal State . Where , however , as under the German Constitution , certain of the States are granted special privileges , the demarcation of spheres of competence and the determination of the exact relations between the Empire and the various States are not a little difficult . It may be laid down , however , as a general principle , that the rights and duties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as property matters are concerned , follow the lines of administrative competence . All matters to which the self-government of the States extends , fall , so far as relations touching property rights are concerned , to the Fiscus of the State , while the rights and duties growing out of legal matters concluded by the imperial authorities , so far as these affect property , fall to the Imperial Fiscus . ' As a general rule , i.e. unless otherwise provided , the Imperial Fiscus is represented by the Imperial Chancellor . In actual practice , the representation of the Imperial Fiscus is determined by the organization of the imperial boards and the competence assigned to these boards and officials by law and ordinance . ' In suits at law the representation of the Imperial Fiscus is regulated by the provisions of administrative law . As a rule the higher authorities are designated to conduct the proceedings . Although the imperial treasury is in Berlin , and the seat // of the Imperial Chancellor is also in the same city , yet the status of the Imperial Fiscus before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i8 of the Code of Civil Procedure ( Civilprozessordnung ) lays down the principle that " the general status of the Fiscus before the court is determined by the seat of that board ( Behorde ) , which is summoned to represent the Fiscus in the suit at law . " The Imperial Fiscus , then , is the Empire itself manifesting its activity as the subject of property rights . The determination of the board which shall represent the Fiscus , the standing of the Fiscus before the courts , the question whether it shall submit to the application of private law and the regular method of procedure , as well as the privileges which it may claim , ? all these matters are regulated by imperial legislation , and such legislation , when had , is exclusive . In all matters concerning the Imperial Fiscus , the Empire takes precedence of the State , and may be subjected to regulation by State legislation only by its own consent . Where there is no imperial law controlling the matter , the following principle holds : if the Imperial Fiscus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation of a federal State , has taken the place of the State Fiscus , the general legal principles which are valid for the State Fiscus find application to the Imperial Fiscus as well . Whatever privileges , whether in the form of processual advantages , privileges at private law , or exemptions from taxation , are enjoyed in the State by its own Fiscus , are , therefore , enjoyed // by the Imperial Fiscus also . But there is no ground upon which the Imperial Fiscus can claim a more favorable position than is conceded to the State Fiscus in that same territory . ' I. The Working Capital of the Empire German writers on the constitutional law of the Empire are wont to divide the property of the Empire into two classes : the administrative means ( Verwaltungsvermogen ) and the financial means ( Finanzvermogen ) . Under the head of administrative means are classed " all those objects of value which constitute the apparatus required in accomplishing the constitutional purposes and tasks of the State , and which belong , therefore , to the service of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State . The characteristic feature of this sort of property is that it is not free , disposable capital , but is limited by the object for which it is to be spent . The financial means , on the contrary , do not serve the ends of the State directly , but , through its capital value ( Kapitalswerth ) or the revenue from it , puts the government in a position where it can meet a part of the costs incidental upon carrying out State ends . I t is the productive ( werbendes ) or economic ( wirtscha f tliches ) means of the State . The acquisition , possession , and administration of this means does not constitute an end of the State , but is simply designed to lighten indirectly the accom- // plishment of the State 's tasks . The investment and administration of this capital , then , is free , i.e. determined purely by political and financial considerations . ) ' The administration of the financial means of the Empire , so far as no other provision is made , falls to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the administrative means is carried on by the various administrative boards within whose province it may lie . 1 . The Administrative Means of the Empire . ? Every State , no matter what its form may be , requires a vast amount of property , movable and immovable , devoted to the service of the various branches of the government . This array of property forms the administrative equipment of the State . It consists of buildings , office furnishings , apparatus ; in short , it covers the thousand and one things in use in the administrative work of the State . From this property no revenue is expected or realized . It is this characteristic which distinguishes it , as already suggested , from the purely financial operations of the State . Like most federal States , the German Empire was erected out of commonwealths , each of which possessed its own independent administrative organization and , as a matter of course , its own independent administrative equipment . On the formation of the Empire , or , more properly , on the formation of the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , either wholly or in part , to the federal government , with no clear line of demarcation between the rights of the Bund and the rights of the individual States in the property employed in such administrative service after the transfer was made . No definite principle was laid down as to the rights of the Empire itself in property used by the Empire for the general // ends of imperial administration . Nothing was said on the subject in the Constitution of the Bund or in the Imperial Constitution . The exceptions made in favor of the South German States with reference to certain branches of administration rendered the situation still more complicated and confusing . In the Empire two distinct groups of administrative property could be distinguished : first , the property which belonged undoubtedly to the Empire , since it was acquired by the Empire itself and had never formed any part of the equipment of a State ; and , second , property which belonged with equal certainty to the several States , since it had never been transferred , in whole or part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a great mass of property which had belonged , some of it wholly , to some one of the States , and all of which had received repairs , additions , and so on , at the hands of the Empire . To whom did this property belong , and what would be its status should it cease to be used for purposes of imperial administration ? The property furnished by the Empire belonged undoubtedly to the Imperial Fiscus . The property employed in the administrative service of the States belonged beyond all question to the State Fiscus , in those branches of administration which had not been transferred to the Empire . But here was a great bulk of property created by the State and in use in the service of the Empire . Did the title pass with the use ? Did the Empire , with the assumption of the administration , succeed also to the property rights in the equipment of these administrative functions ? This question , which provoked no little discussion among German jurists , ' was finally settled by the " Law on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Imperial Administration " ( Gesetz fiber die Rechtsverhaltnisse der zum dienstlichen Gebrauche einer Reichsverzealtung bestimmten Gegenstande ) .1 This law vests the property , in the administrative equipment taken over from the various States , in the Empire , but with a reversionary right of the individual State with respect to objects no longer in the service of the imperial administration . This law , as Laband observes , did not fuse all the administrative equipment of the Empire into a single mass . It was parted , as before , into two masses , the one distinctly and solely imperial and the other originating in the States , but it did remove the uncertainty by denominating this property no longer as belonging to the Imperial Fiscus and the State Fiscus , but as " dominium perpetuum and dominium revocabile of the Empire . " The Law of 25 May , 1873 , extends not only to the objects actually on the inventory of the imperial administration , but it includes also all objects which are devoted to any constitutional administrative service supported by imperial means . ' Under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no small part of the public business is carried on by the administrative organization of the several States . The administration , in such cases , is not imperial , but State administration . This is specially true of the military administration , to which by far the greater part of the administrative means of the Empire is devoted . There is no imperial military administration . Had the Law of 25 May , 1873 , extended only to objects in the actual " // service of the imperial administration , all the objects devoted to the military administration would have still remained the property of the several States . The same is true of the postal and telegraph administration in part , the administration of which is divided between the Empire and the individual States . But in the case of the military administration , and of the administration of the post and telegraph , the cost is borne by the Empire , though the actual administration is carried on by the States , either in whole or in part . By the terms of the law , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted to any constitutional administrative service supported by imperial means , the equipment of the military administration , as well as of the postal and telegraph administration , has become and remains the property of the Empire . ' Although no general distinction is made in the law between movable and immovable property , certain pieces of real estate ( Grundstucke ) are exempted from the law 's operation . ' The exceptions are as follows : ? ( I ) Real estate which , while employed in the service of the imperial administration , is devoted by the State to the use of the ruler or to the maintenance of the members of the ruling House . ( 2 ) Real estate which , at the time the costs of administration were assumed by the Empire , had been transferred to . // the administration of the Empire only for a specified term , or on recall , or by way of rent . ( 3 ) Real estate out of whose proceeds the expenditures made by the State , for the acquiring of , or the erecting of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same imperial administration , are to be replaced , according to the arrangements made on the subject . ( 4 ) Real estate which at the time of the transfer to the imperial administration was not in the immediate use of a branch of the service , but only connected with it to the extent that the revenue accruing from the real estate was placed to the account of that branch of the service . ( 5 ) Real estate which is partly in use of the Empire and partly in use of the State , in so far as the joint use enjoyed by the State is not granted merely for a specified term , or upon recall , or by way of rent . The Empire does not hold a condominium in such property , but the imperial administration holds the right of use to the extent granted , until such time as an agreement may be made with the State administration with respect to a division of the property , or some other arrangement . When a piece of land has become no longer indispensable to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there seems to be no need for a substitute to replace it , then is such real estate , in the condition in which it may be at the time , without expense and without compensation for any improvement or damages , to be returned to that State from the possession of which it was transferred to the Empire . ' The fact that a reversionary right belongs to the // State does not act as a bar to the alienation of such property by the Imperial Fiscus , should it become unserviceable or no longer needed ; but , in such case , the Imperial Fiscus must use the proceeds to secure another piece of real estate , or to erect another building or other buildings in the territory of the same State as a substitute for the property which has become unserviceable or superfluous . ' When a fortification is abandoned , the land reverts to the State in whose territory it is located , but only after the necessary grading and levelling have been done and the costs of the same repaid . ' These costs are fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the imperial administration in whose possession the real estate may be.3 2 . The Financial Means of the Empire . ? By " financial means " is meant , as already suggested , the productive capital of the Empire , that is , such means as brings in an income for the Empire . At the time of their founding , neither the North German Bund nor the German Empire possessed property of this description . The immense war indemnity demanded of France at the close of the War of 1870 furnished the opportunity for the creation of means of this kind . ( I ) By the Law of ii November , 1871 , ' it was provided // that , on condition of the abolishment of the Prussian State Treasure , the amount of 40,000,000 thalers ? about $28,500,000 ? might be appropriated out of the French war indemnity for the creation of an imperial war treasure . ' This money was to consist of gold coin . It could be used only for the mobilization of the army . ' For the expenditure of this money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaiser must be obtained . This order must issue with the consent of the Bundesrat and Reichstag , or their ratification of it must be subsequently obtained . ' It is not easy to see , however , since there is no provision by law for such a contingency , what the legal result of a refusal to ratify such expenditure of the War Treasure would be . The administration of the War Treasure is under the control of the Imperial Debt Commission , which reports annually to the Bundesrat and Reichstag at their regular meeting , declares that the yearly inspection and inventory of the War Treasure have been made , and certifies to the presence of the 120,000,000 marks in " gold coin of the Empire . " ' // The War Treasure , then , consists of a fixed and dead deposit in the vault of the Julius Tower . No current revenue can be derived from it , and it can not exceed the amount set by law ? 120,000,000 marks . Nor does the law provide any definite means of bringing the amount up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Speaking strictly , the War Treasure can not be classed as productive funds , and , for that reason , hardly falls within the definition of " financial means . " It is , however , acquired means , and , for the sake of convenience , has been considered under the general head of the financial means of the Empire . ( 2 ) In order to meet the expenditures made necessary by the law pensioning and otherwise providing for persons who had served in the army or navy during the war of 1870-71 , as well as their surviving families , ' the sum of 187,000,000 thalers ? 561,000,000 marks , or about $133,000,000 ? was set aside by law out of the French War Indemnity ' This fund is called the Imperial Invalid Fund , or Fund for the Disabled ( Reichsinvaliden f ond ) This fund was to be invested in such wise that there should be a return therefrom in the way of interest , and , in order to cut off the possibility of speculation in these moneys , the law fixed the nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Military Pension Law of 27 June , 1871 , to which reference has already been made , and which was supplemented by the Laws of 4 April , 1874,1 21 April , 1886,2 and 22 May , 1893,3 transferring to this Fund the payment of certain costs hitherto laid on the imperial treasury . The theory upon which the Invalid Fund was established and according to which it has been administered , seems to be that not only the interest on the capital should be expended , but that the principal itself should gradually be consumed . ' Finding that the proceeds from the invested funds were considerably more than enough to meet the demands made upon them , the number and class of beneficiaries have been extended by legislation covering a period of years , until at present the expenditures exceed the income . ' Should the interest on the invested fund show a surplus at any time , however , such surplus does not and can not , under the law , flow into the Invalid Fund , but it is deposited in the imperial treasury . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ensuing // year , part of which was to be met by drawing on the principal of the fund , prove too high , such part of the principal as was appropriated , but not used , is not transferred to the treasury of the Empire , but is returned to the fund itself . Should the time ever come when the fund would be no longer needed , it would not even then become , ipso facto , part of the treasury funds of the Empire , but would remain a free fund at the sole disposal of the legislative bodies of the Empire . The duties and obligations arising out of the fund are duties and obligations of the Imperial Fiscus , and the income and expenditure of the fund must be assumed annually in the imperial budget . The administration of the Invalid Fund is regulated by the Law of 23 May , 1873,1 which provides for the creation of a board which shall bear the name of the " Administration of the Imperial Invalid Fund . " This board consists of three members and a chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its seat in Berlin . The members of the board are held unconditionally responsible for the investment , accounting , and administration of the fund , and are to be sworn into office at an open session of the Reichsgericht.2 The oath contains an affirmation " that they will not allow themselves to be hindered in the discharge of the duties laid upon them , and for which they are responsible , by any instructions or ordinances of any sort whatever . " This board is wholly independent of and separate from the general financial administration of the Empire , but is subjected to the " superior guidance " of the Imperial Chancellor , so far as may be done without infringing on the independence laid down in the section // of the law above quoted . This " obere Leitung " of the Chancellor , however , empowers him to make binding orders and decrees which the Administration of the Imperial Invalid Fund must obey , ' but at the same time the " unconditional responsibility " of the Administration authorizes it and , in fact , obligates it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see whether they are in accord with the legal regulations governing the investment , accounting , and administration of the fund . The orders and decrees of the Imperial Chancellor are to be executed only when this testing results affirmatively 2 The members of the Administration of the Imperial Invalid Fund are elected by the Bundesrat for a term of three years . The office of chairman is a salaried position , and the incumbent may not hold any other office at the same time , or conduct any business from which he receives remuneration . ' The members of the Administration of the Imperial Invalid Fund are members of the Bundesrat , who carry on the work as a salaried side office . ' The permanent control and supervision of the administration is assigned to the Imperial Debt Commission , which may at any time satisfy itself as to the manner in which the funds are invested . The Commission receives monthly and annual reports from the Administration of the Imperial Invalid Fund , and must make at least one examination ( Re- // vision ) each year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every third year the Commission must also lay before the Reichstag a statement particularly setting forth the assets and liabilities of the fund . ' ( 3 ) By the terms of the treaty of peace concluded between Germany and France in 1871 , the German government took over the railroads in Alsace-Lorraine , formerly the property of the French government , at a valuation of 325,000,000 francs , which sum was to be deducted from the war indemnity imposed on France . ' By this act these roads became the property of the German government and their administration a part of the administration of the Empire . Improvements and extensions made by the German government , for the most part out of funds granted by the Empire , have brought the total investment in these railroads up to about 600,000,000 marks . ' The administration of the imperial railroads belonged originally to the sphere of the Imperial Chancellor , but by the Decree of 27 May , 1878 , ' the administration was removed from the immediate supervision of the Imperial Chancellor and assigned to a special imperial office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this board , thus bringing the administration of the imperial railroads into closer connection with the administration of the Prussian railways . The actual administration of the roads of Alsace- // Lorraine is carried on by the " General Directory of Railroads in Alsace-Lorraine , " with its seat in Strassburg . This directory was created by the Decree of 9 December , 1871.1 A report of the amount spent on the imperial railroads is given annually as an appendix to the draft of the Budget Law . In connection with the administration of the railroads in Alsace-Lorraine , the imperial government has also assumed the operation of the Wilhelm-Luxemburg railroad in the Duchy of Luxemburg , under an agreement which runs till 31 December , 1912.2 Several other small sections of railroad in Luxemburg are also operated by the Administration of Imperial Railroads. ( 4 ) Certain funds , the general working funds of the imperial administration , constitute what is known as the " eiserne Bestande , " or permanent funds of the Empire . They were created by the Budget Law of 1872 , and have been increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not been absorbed by the imperial administration , in fact , they are a treasury surplus , at the free disposal of the Empire . This sum , the " Betriebsfonds , " as it is called , is divided into five sub-funds : the Imperial Treasury Fund , for meeting imperial operations for which no special fund is designated , the Legation Fund , the Imperial Printing-office Fund , the Fund for Postal and Telegraph Administration , and the Fund for the Equipment of Troops . ( 5 ) Certain special property of the Empire must also be mentioned , ' to wit , ( a ) the Deutscher Reichs- and Preussischer Staats-Ansciger , a daily paper , published in Berlin , // and serving as the medium through which official proclamations are brought to public notice . Up to 1889 the proceeds from the publication of this paper were divided between the Empire and Prussia , two-thirds going to Prussia and onethird to the Empire . Since 1889 the division has been equal . ( b ) The Imperial Printing-office ( Reichsdrucherei ) , which was created under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imperial Chancellor was authorized to purchase a certain private printing establishment in Berlin . To this establishment was added , by the Law of 15 May , 1879 , the Printingoffice of Prussia , and the two were consolidated into the Imperial Printing-office . While this office is designed primarily for the service of the Empire and of Prussia , yet it is permitted to publish private works , the issuance of which may be regarded as an aid to science or art . ' The Imperial Printingoffice is administered by a board which is placed under the control of the Imperial Post-office . This Board is called the Directory of the Imperial Printing-office . ' II . The Imperial Income. ? In speaking of the income of the Empire , Art . 70 of the Imperial Constitution does not use the phrase " imperial income " or " income of the Empire , " but prefers to employ the term " common income " or " community income " or " join income . " The word is " gemeinschaftliche . " At any rate , what is meant is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Empire , . // is used for imperial purposes under the laws and Constitution of the Empire , and lies wholly outside the financial system and financial control of the several States . This common income , spoken of in Art . 7o of the Constitution , includes the following : ( t ) the revenues from the tariff , or customs , and from the five great " Consumption Taxes , " the tax , that is , on salt , tobacco , sugar , beer , and brandy ; ( 2 ) the profits from the postal and telegraph service ; ( 3 ) the profits from the operation of the imperial railroads , including the leased lines in Luxemburg ; the profits from the Imperial Printing-office and from the publication of the Reichs- and Staats-Anzeiger ; the profits from coinage and the net earnings of the Imperial Bank ; ( 4 ) the interest and extras from the Invalid Fund and from moneys invested by the Empire ; ( 5 ) fees from various imperial offices and boards , e.g. the fees from the Imperial Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 ) returns from the leasing or renting of administrative buildings , etc. , and the proceeds from the sale of property no longer needed or serviceable for administrative purposes ; ( 7 ) the contributions of individual States to certain imperial expenses , such as the Prussian contribution to the North Sea Canal , and that of Alsace-Lorraine to the Imperial Treasury Office and the Court of Accounts ; ( 8 ) the revenue from the Imperial Stamp Tax and from the so-called Statistical Tax , as well as from the tax on bank-notes ; ( q ) the surplus , if any , from the preceding year ; ( to ) imperial loans . ' It should be noted that Bavaria has no share in the income from the administration of the imperial army and of the general military pension fund , for the reason that the financial administration of military affairs is not " joint " between Bavaria and the other States . Further , Bavaria and Wurttemberg have no share in the profits of the postal and telegraph . // administration . Bavaria , Wurttemberg , Baden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tax on beer , nor from the transit dues on beer , nor do these States share in the " averse " paid in lieu of this tax by those districts of the Empire excluded from the Zollgebiet , or general Customs District . The " special privileges " conceded to certain States operate also with respect to any surplus which may exist from a preceding year , for those States can not profit by a surplus arising out of revenues in part affected by these " Sonderrechte , " or , in other words , those States enjoying special privileges have no share in the distribution of a surplus which has arisen , at least in part , from revenues in which they have no rights . A discrimination is made , therefore , based on the source of the surplus . The same principle obtains also with respect to loans assumed by the Empire . ' i . The Customs and the Consumption Taxes . ' ? In the realization of German unity , in the creation of the North German Bund and of the Empire , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hardly be overestimated . Long before the North German Bund had welded the greater part of Germany into a political integer , the adoption of identical tariff laws , a similarity of customs administration , and a community of revenue had paved the way for that mighty event . " The German Zollverein was not only a powerful bond that held together the majority of the German States during the time when they were sovereign ; it was not only , // from an economic and political viewpoint , a preparatory stage , out of which the reconstruction of Germany proceeded along State lines ; but the institutions built up in the Zollverein were , in great measure , taken over into the Constitution of the Bund , and form to this day a permanent part of the constitutional law of the Empire . The history of the Zollverein may be called with right the antecedent history of the German Empire . " ' Article 40 of the Imperial Constitution declares that " the provisions of the Customs Union Treaty ( Zollvereinigungsvertrag ) of 8 July , 1867 , shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amended by the provisions of this Constitution and so long as they are not altered in the manner prescribed in Art . 7 or Art . 78 of this Constitution . " This declaration maintains the continuity between the former Zollverein and the tariff system of the Empire . The fundamental principles of the imperial tariff organization are borrowed directly from the Zollverein , and the provisions of the Customs Union Treaty still have , for the most part , material force . Notwithstanding the fact that the content of the treaty of 1867 remains in force to such an extent , it must not be inferred that the tariff organization of the Empire rests , for that reason , upon a mere contractual basis . This point is argued clearly by Laband , 2 from whose discussion the following somewhat lengthy paragraphs are quoted : " By the founding of the North German Bund , the Zollverein , as it was finally constituted by the Treaty of 16 May , 1865 , was certainly trans- // formed very considerably , so far as the States entering the North German Bund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect to the former , a collective relation was replaced by a State relation . A constitution took the place of an agreement . Instead of the right of withdrawal after giving due notice , instead of the formation of an association to run for a definite time , there was created a permanent relation which could not be terminated upon notice . In place of the requirement of unanimous consent to all amendments of the tariff laws or changes of tariff arrangements , there was introduced the method of law and ordinance . Instead of distributing the revenue from the tariff , and from the consumption taxes , among the members of the Verein , the income was now applied to settling the expense account of the Bund . Although the North German Bund retained , in the main , the principles in accordance with which the administration of the customs and the levying of customs duties and taxes were regulated , yet the Verein , as such , no longer existed between the members of the Bund . It was absorbed by the political unity of the Confederation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen in the fact that the unitary regulation of the customs was applied to those States also , and to those sections of the North German Bund , which had not belonged to the Zollverein , so far as the Constitution of the Bund itself did not make an exception . ' So far as the South German States were concerned , although it actually continued during the war of 1866 , the Zollverein was legally dissolved by the outbreak of hostilities and by the political collapse of some of its members . In the individual treaties with Prussia ( Art . 7 of these treaties ) , this was generally recognized by the South German States , but it was agreed at the same time that the Customs Union Treaties should again // come into force , with the reservation that either party to the contract might dissolve it at any time upon six months ' notice . This right of notice Prussia used as a handle to bring about a reform in the Zollverein , and the Prussian government succeeded in carrying through the Zollvereinigungsvertrag ' of 8 July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties : the North German Bund and the four South German States . It created a union with a determinate limit ? to 31 December , 1877 , which could be extended , however , tacitly , by periods of twelve years . It preserved the agreements of the old Customs and Commercial Union treaties in force , so far as they were not altered by the new treaty itself . For transacting the business of the Union , the forms and organs of the North German Bund were adopted . ' " With the founding of the Empire , this Union also came to an end . The legal relation of its members was transformed just as the relation of the members of the older Union was transformed by the erection of the North German Bund . It is true that the express wording of Art . 40 of the Imperial Constitution provides that the regulations of the Customs Union Treaty of 8 July , 1867 , shall remain in force so far as they are not altered by the Constitution itself ; but the fundamental principle that the Empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusive authority of the Empire to legislate in matters touching the customs and the consumption taxes laid down in Art . 38 of the Constitution , the right of the Bundesrat to issue ordinances , the supervision of the authorities of the several States by the Kaiser , etc. , are constitutionally fixed , and have nothing to do with a term limit , made dependent on the will of the individual States . ' The reference to the provisions of the Customs Union Treaty in Art . 40 of the Imperial Constitution must not mislead one into // the mistaken notion that , in addition to the constitutional bond which unites the Empire , there exists also a special tariff connection between the German States , based on contract . The content of these provisions is of small moment , so far as this point is concerned . Everything that may become the content of a law may also be made the content of a treaty between States , and vice versa . The legal ground upon which the binding force of the provisions rest is alone decisive , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the order of a superior State-power , ? and this legal ground has been changed by the precise fact that it is the Constitution which has retained the provisions of the Customs Union Treaty in force . The important practical result from this fact is drawn by Art . 40 itself , viz. that these provisions remain in force so far as they are not changed by the provisions of this Constitution and so long as they are not amended in the way prescribed in Art . 7 or Art . 78 . ' Hence , for the amendment of these provisions of the Treaty , the consent of all the States is not necessary , nor , in case the Reichstag refuses its consent , is the consent of all the States sufficient . The extension of these provisions to Alsace-Lorraine by way of ordinary legislation confirms the fact that here we have to do with imperial law , not with treaty rights . But the possibility is not excluded , however , that certain provisions contained in the Customs Union Treaty may create special rights for individual States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the State affected " ( RVcrf . Art . 78 , Cl. 2 ) . The simple declaration of Art . 40 involves far more than at first appears . And for this reason : the Treaty of 8 July , 1867 , does not contain an explicit statement of the laws and regulation which it itself covers . Article 1 of the Treaty says : " The Customs Union Treaties of 22 and 30 March and 1 i May , 1833 , of 12 May and 10 December , 1835 , of 2 January , 1836 , // of 8 May , 19 October , and 13 November , 1841 , of 4 April , 1853 , and 16 May , 1865 , as well as the separate articles between the contracting parties which belong to these treaties , shall remain in force so far as they were still in force and are not amended by the article following . " Further , Art . 1 of the Final Protocol of the Treaty of 8 July , 1867 , declares that " the agreement made in Art . 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treaties therein named , shall extend also to those more particular provisions and agreements contained in the protocols belonging to each of those treaties , as well as to all agreements whatever made in pursuance of the Customs Union Treaties , for the execution of the same and for the further development of the Union . " 1 It will be seen , then , that in order to a definite and clear understanding of the scope of Art . 40 of the Imperial Constitution , a detailed study of the various treaties cited must be made . For , according to Art . 40 , each and every agreement made by the members of the Customs Union since 22 March , 1833 , not specifically amended by subsequent treaty or legislation , is still in force . The final appeal in questions arising under Art . 40 , therefore , is not to Art . 40 itself , nor to the Treaty of 8 July , 1867 , to which it makes specific reference , but to all the treaties , protocols , and enactments of the General Conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 40 is to change the character of those // provisions which remain in force . What had rested upon a basis of contract hitherto , a basis of international law , now rests upon a basis of constitutional law . These provisions can no longer be amended by mutual agreement between the members of the Union , ? that Union ceased to exist with the founding of the Empire , ? but only by the method of legislation as prescribed by Art . 7 of the Imperial Constitution , or , if their amendment involves also an alteration of the Constitution itself , by the method laid down in Art . 78 . What , therefore , had been an agreement between contracting parties , sanctioned by international law , has become , in some instances , a part of the law of a State , and in other instances , an integral part of the Constitution of that State . It would far transcend the scope and limits of this study , should an attempt be made to specify the particular articles which come under consideration and to classify them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , in general terms , that so far as the provisions of the various treaties which are maintained in force contain regulations touching matters which do not fall within the legislative competence of the Empire , constitutionally , they must be regarded as incorporated into the Constitution as part and parcel of it , and any amendment is an amendment of Art . 40 itself and may be accomplished only in the method constitutionally provided for such amendment . Further , provisions regulating the rights of the several States as against the Empire in matters of customs must also be regarded as constitutional regulations . ' So far as the provisions of the Customs Union Treaties touch matters // which lie within the legislative competence of the Empire under the Constitution , they may be amended or repealed in the way of ordinary legislation . They constitute a group of regulations , therefore , with the force of simple law . ' In reading the Treaty of 16 May , 1865 , it will be noted that a classification has therein been made with respect to the adopted regulations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the following principle : all stipulations which have been invested by the contracting governments with a formal legislative character are incorporated into the body of the Treaty , while regulations of an administrative nature are placed in the Final Protocol . This arrangement is also found in the Treaty of 8 July , 1867 . The effect of this arrangement is simply this : those stipulations which are incorporated into the body of the Treaty of 1867 , together with those provisions which are therein declared to be a part of that Treaty , have the force of formal law ; while the stipulations relegated to the Final Protocol have the force of administrative ordinances . ' From this continuity between the Empire and the Zollverein have arisen the principles which underlie the general tariff system of the Empire : the territory of the Empire constitutes a single customs and commercial district , bounded by a common customs boundary , within which all traffic and trade shall be free ; all tariff legislation is unitary and falls within the exclusive competence of the Empire ; and , finally , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sumption taxes , under imperial laws and ordinances , are left to the several States , the right of supervision being reserved to the Emperor . ' These three principles must be briefly discussed . ( 1 ) Section VI . of the Imperial Constitution , which deals with matters of tariff and trade , opens with the following statement , which constitutes the first sentence of Art . 33 : " Germany forms a single customs and commercial district , bounded 1 ) y common tariff limits . " In other words , according to the intention of the Constitution the boundary of the customs jurisdictions coincides with the boundary of the Empire . In actual practice , however , this rule is modified , since territory which does not belong to the Empire is included within the tariff district , and territory which does belong to the Empire is excluded . To the former category belong portions of foreign territory , to wit , Luxemburg and the Austrian Communes of Jungholz and Mittelberg , the so-called " Z ollannexe. " 2 // To the second category belong what are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portions of the Empire excluded from the tariff jurisdiction . These Exclaven are expressly recognized by the Imperial Constitution , and fall into two classes . The first class is described in Art . 33 of the Constitution , the first clause of which reads : " Those peculiar portions of the territory , which , on account of their location , are not adapted to incorporation within the tariff boundaries , remain excluded . " These Exclaven are listed in Art . 6 of the Customs Union Treaty of 1867 , but most of them have since been included in the tariff district . ' The basis on which any territory may be excluded from the general tariff jurisdiction of the Empire is , as the wording of Art 33 , Cl. 2 , indicates clearly , the question of expediency pure and simple . It is a matter of administrative technique . The decision of the question of exclusion , as well as of the withdrawal of such exclusion , rests , therefore , with the Bundesrat . No act of formal legislation is necessary . As Laband well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariff district is recognized by the Constitution , but the permissibility of Exclaven is also recognized , and the rule laid down , that such exclusion is " on account of their situation . " The actual exclusion of a certain territory , therefore , involves simply the application of this rule to a // particular case . In other words , it involves the carrying out of the law , not an amendment of it . ' The second class of Exclaven recognized by the Constitution is indicated by Art . 34 , which reads : " The Hanse Cities of Bremen and Hamburg , together with such portion of their district or surrounding territory as may be suitable for such purpose , may remain as free havens , outside the common tariff boundaries , until such time as they may request incorporation into the same . " 2 This second class of Exclaven stands on a different footing from that of the first class in a very important respect . It has just been pointed out that the decision with reference to the exclusion of places , whose location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too costly or too inconvenient , rests with the Bundesrat , which may include or exclude those districts according to its own discretion . Whatever action the Bundesrat may take in the matter infringes no constitutional right of the State whose territory is affected , and raises no right of resistance on the part of that State . Not so with Bremen and Hamburg . By the express terms of the Constitution , they are made free havens , whose status in this regard can not be changed except on their own motion . Inclusion within the boundaries of the general tariff jurisdiction , therefore , can not be brought about without their consent . That consent being given , the assumption of these cities into the tariff district of the Empire would carry with it an amendment of Art . 34 of the Constitution no more than an action with reference to the Exclaven mentioned in Art . 33 , Cl . I , involves an amendment of that part of the Constitution . On the basis of a treaty concluded between the Imperial // Chancellor and the Senate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law of 16 February , 1882,2 touching the annexation of Hamburg to the tariff district of the Empire , the Hamburg Senate requested the reception of the Hamburg district , with the exception of its own harbor , into the tariff district of the Empire , and the Bundesrat granted its request . The actual incorporation took place on I5 October , 1888 . At the same time , the territory , till then outside the common tariff boundaries , on the basis of a resolution of the Bundesrat , 6 November , 1884 , was annexed to the tariff district of the Empire , with the exception of the harbor constructions at Bremerhaven and the adjoining storage place for petroleum , and a free district was established near Bremen on the right bank of the Weser . ' The territories of Hamburg and Bremen , still lying outside the boundaries of the common tariff jurisdiction , fall within the operation of Art . 34 of the Constitution . The status of these districts can not be changed by any unilateral act of the Bundesrat , but only on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Empire are considered a part of the federal territory , and hence fall within the tariff boundaries . Considerable discussion arose respecting the status of the lower Elbe , from Hamburg to the mouth of the river , under the Elbe Navigation Act of 1821 . ' By a resolution of 8 December , 1881 , the Bundesrat included the lower Elbe , together with the islands therein , in the common tariff dis- // trict , 1 with a provision freeing the ships to and from Hamburg from any action on the part of the customs officials . The lower Weser was also added to the common tariff territory at the same time the Bremen territory was absorbed . ' The second clause of Art . 33 of the Imperial Constitution reads as follows " All articles , traffic in which is free in any one of the several States , may be imported into every other State , and in the latter shall be subjected to dues only so far as similar domestic products are subjected to an internal tax there . " Here the principle that Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Several points , however , must be noted . In the first place , the power of the several States to lay and collect taxes on articles of consumption is not unconditionally taken away from them , but it is subjected to a number of limitations . No further tax may be laid by the States upon articles imported from a foreign land , on which the Empire imposes a duty of more than three marks per kilo . Where , however , articles are imported upon which further work is done in Germany , or where liquors are imported , a tax by the States on the improvement of the one or on the circulation of the other is not prohibited , provided such tax is a general one and makes no distinction in its application between articles as to whether they are of foreign or of domestic origin . ' With respect to foreign importations which do not pay more than three marks duty per kilo , and with respect also to domestic products , the States may tax the // production , preparation , or consumption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they may levy new taxes , amend or repeal taxes already laid , or retain the taxes in existence at the time the Customs Union of 1867 was created , but " for the present , ' ? fiir jetzt , " ? such taxes may be levied only on the following domestic products , i.e. products of the particular State and products of the common tariff district : brandy , beer , vinegar , malt , wine , must , cider , flour , and other mill products , bakers ' wares , meat , meat provisions , and fats . ' Further , the limitation upon the States extends also to the lesser divisions , i.e. the Communes and Corporations . No State may grant to a Commune or Corporation the right to levy a tax to meet its expenses , except on articles designed for local consumption . ' The articles upon which such a communal tax may be laid are the following : beer , vinegar , malt , cider , products liable to the milling tax and the slaughter tax , as well as combustibles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is permissible in those parts of the tariff district " which belong to the wine-growing section proper . " Finally , for whatever purpose the tax is levied , // whether for the expenses of the State or of the Commune , the products of another State can , under no pretence , be taxed more highly than the products of the State into which they are brought , or than the products of the rest of the States . ' Certain modifications of the principle of free commerce within the territory of the Empire grow out of the right conceded to the States to lay a consumption tax . The Customs Union Treaty of 1867 , Art . 5 , II . ? 3 , d , provides that " those States which have levied internal taxes on the production or preparation of an article of consumption may collect the legal amount of the same in full on the importation of the article from other States of the Union . " 2 The Treaty further provides that in the States of the Band no transit tax shall be collected on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union . ' Further , the Treaty ' provides that those States which have levied a tax upon the purchase and sale , the consumption , production , or preparation of an article of consumption , may , on the exportation of the article to another State of the Union , leave the tax uncollected , or may refund the lawful amount of the same in whole or in part . But the refunding shall take place only so far as a compensation for taxes is guaranteed on the exportation of said article to a foreign land , and only , as a maximum , to the amount of such compensation . The authorities also shall especially see to it that in no case more than the amount of the // tax actually paid in shall be returned , and this compensation shall not have the nature or effect of an export premium . ' Moreover , the release from obligation to pay the tax shall not be effective , nor shall the refunding of the tax take place , before the entrance of the taxed product into the bordering State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destination , shall have been proven in such way as may be agreed upon by the States concerned . A schedule of transit taxes and compensations is specially fixed , in accord with ? ? 3 and 4 of the Treaty , by the proper authorities in each State . Any change whatever in the rate of taxation on domestic products must be brought to the notice of the Bundesrat , and proof submitted that the amount of the tax which shall be levied as a result of the effected or intended amendment , upon the products of the States of the Union , and the amount of rebate upon the exportation of the taxed articles , correspond to the principles laid down . ' No State may , in any circumstances or under any conditions , levy a tax on the transportation of goods through its territory . ' Finally , the several States have not the power to prohibit the importation of goods into their territory , nor to hamper it with burdensome conditions . Nor may they forbid exportation , since such action would conflict with " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 35 , of the Imperial Constitution . ' The State may , however , impose limitations upon traffic in certain conditions , where sanitary precautions justify it , as , for instance , an ordinance on the part of the proper authorities against the introduction of diseased cattle or of infected clothing or wares . ' ( 2 ) Article 35 of the Imperial Constitution reads : " The Empire shall have the exclusive power to legislate with respect to all matters concerning the tariff ; the taxation of salt and tobacco produced in the territory of the Union ; the taxation of prepared brandies and beers as well as of sugar and syrup made from beets or from other domestic products . It shall have exclusive power to legislate with respect to the mutual protection of the consumption taxes levied in the several States against fraud , as well as with respect to the measures required in the Exclaven , for the security of the common customs boundaries . " By thus centralizing the exclusive power of imposing customs duties and of taxing the five great articles of consumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fully assured . In legislating upon these topics , the competence of the Empire is unlimited . It covers the whole subject of the customs , fixes the rate , specifies the articles to be subjected to duty , provides for the collection of the customs dues and the supervision of that collection , establishes police regulations concerning warehouses , as well as the import , export , and transport of goods , organizes the necessary boards of officials and defines their powers , punishes frauds and determines the procedure in the trial of persons accused of such defraudation , and enacts any and all measures required to accomplish the // ends for which the customs duties are imposed . It need scarcely be added that in none of these matters are the several States competent to legislate , nor may they conclude treaties affecting these subjects with foreign States . A discussion of the laws touching the customs or the taxes laid upon articles of consumption would hardly fall within the scope of this present work . ' Like so many of the provisions of the Imperial Constitution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article reads : " In Bavaria , Wurttemberg , and Baden , the taxation of domestic beer and brandy is reserved for the legislation of each State . These States , however , shall direct their efforts toward bringing about uniform legislation respecting the taxation of these articles . " Under this provision of the Constitution , therefore , these three States were not included in the general scope of the imperial taxation upon brandies and beers . They paid an aversum , or lump sum , into the imperial treasury , a sum based upon the proportion which their population bore to the whole population of the Empire , and the revenue from the taxation upon brandies and beer flowed into the treasury of each State . As the clause stood , the competence of the Empire to legislate with reference to the taxation of these two commodities was , therefore , excluded from these three States . So far as beer is concerned , this exclusion still holds . ' A radical change has been effected , so far as respects the taxation of brandy , by the Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the action of these three States making this law operative within their own territories . As a result of such action , the three South German States have been brought within the general tax jurisdiction of the Empire , so far as the taxation of brandy is concerned , and the aversum hitherto paid into the imperial treasury has been abolished . These States now share in the proceeds of the general tax on brandy , according to their proportionate population . Their " special right " with reference to the brandy tax , granted under Cl. 2 of Art . 35 , no longer stands . The situation maybe thus summed up in the words of Laband : " By the consent of the South German States to the introduction of the Law of 24 June , 1887 , the principle of Art.35 ? that the Empire has the exclusive legislative power with respect to the taxation of brandies made within the imperial territory ? became operative also for them . So far as the imperial law itself contains no delegation of power to the individual States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with reference to the taxation of brandies , either in the way of State law or in the form of ordinance . Moreover , the power of the Bundesrat to issue general administrative ordinances necessary for the execution of the brandy tax law , and to take action with respect to defects which make themselves apparent in the execution of the law , or of its own ordinances , extends to the South German States . The supervision of the execution of the law even in the South German States belongs to the Kaiser . The amendment of the Law of 24 June , 1887 , can take place according . // to the rules governing imperial legislation , without any right on the part of the South German States , individually or collectively , to object thereto . This is especially true of the fixing of the rate of taxation . " 1 ( 3 ) Article 35 , Cl . I , as already seen , gives to the Empire the exclusive competence in tariff and tax legislation . Article 7 , Cl. 2 , empowers the Bundesrat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Notwithstanding this , the Empire has no authority to collect the taxes which it levies . " The collection and administration of customs duties and of taxes on articles of consumption ( Art . 35 ) within its own territory , are left to each several State , so far as this has been its practice heretofore. " 2 In other words , the Empire has the right to regulate and supervise the administration of the customs and the taxes on articles of consumption , but the work is actually carried on by the individual States . The phrase , " so far as this has been its practice heretofore , " does not imply a reservation of competence on the part of the Empire . It merely continues in force those limitations upon the several States which are based upon the Customs Union Treaties and the separate agreements concluded between the members of the Union . ' The authority granted to the several States by Art . 36 , Cl. i , extends to the organization of the boards by which the customs and taxes are to be collected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This authority , however , is excl. - // cised under the regulations and limitations of imperial legislation . ' There is no Imperial Board of Customs and Tax Administration . The customs and tax officials receive their instructions from and report to the highest State authorities in tariff and tax matters . These State authorities stand wholly outside the imperial official system . They do not receive their salaries from the imperial treasury . They do not take the oath of loyalty to the Kaiser or to the Empire on assuming their duties , nor do they come under the operation of the laws affecting imperial officials . The supervision exercised by the Empire in accordance with the provisions of the Imperial Constitution is carried on by officials appointed by the Kaiser , with the consent of the Committee on Tariff Matters in the Bundesrat . These officials occupy a peculiar position with reference to the tax and customs officials of the States , and are of two classes : the " Stations-Kontroleure , " or " Konirolcure " as they are more briefly called ? officials associated with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Reichsbevollrnachtigte fiir Zolle and Steuer , " or " Imperial Customs and Tax Deputies , " officials associated with those boards of the State having the direction of matters of customs and taxation . Laband styles these officials " Officials extraordinary for the administration of the customs and taxes . " In the performance of their functions , the first class are subordinate to and receive their instructions from the second . These imperial " officials extraordinary " have no legislative or judicial powers and no vital connection with the officials of the States . ' Their work is peculiarly that of supervision and inspection . To this // end , they have the right of attending meetings of the directive boards of the State , to inspect all books , to audit accounts , and to assure themselves that the service rendered by the officers at the frontier is both efficient and sufficient . Further , all decrees and instructions respecting the administration of the common taxes , sent to their subordinates by the directive Boards of the State , receive the vise of the imperial deputy , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promulgated . ' By such means as this the Empire is kept fully informed of the administration of the customs and taxes in the several States of the Empire . Should a difference of opinion arise over some administrative question between the imperial deputy and the State officials , the deputy has no right to force his views upon the State authorities or to interfere with them in the exercise of their duties . Any such conflict must be carried before the highest administrative authority of the State for its decision . As a matter of general principle , the Empire can not interfere in any judicial process , so long as the means of prosecuting the case by appeal to the State courts has not yet been exhausted . When , however , a decision is finally had in the State tribunals , and such decision is , in the opinion of the imperial deputy , contrary to the law or to the interests of the Empire , or when the remedy , in case a defect has been discovered by the deputy , is not forthcoming in due time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high authorities of the State , the deputy may bring the matter before the Bundesrat.2 // In matters of criminal action touching the customs and the taxes , each several State has the right of pardon and of commutation of sentence within its own territory . ' All fines and confiscations belong to that State whose court has rendered judgment in the first instance . ' The three Southern States and Alsace-Lorraine are not subjected to this system of inspection and supervision just discussed , so far as the administration of the tax on beer is concerned . ( 4 ) Something should be said at this point with reference to the principles controlling the imposition of customs duties in German law . In the German Empire , customs duties are laid only upon articles imported . The exportation and transportation of goods are not taxed . ' So far as their liability to duty is concerned , it is immaterial whether the articles are of foreign or domestic origin , ' nor does it matter whether they have already been subjected to duty or tax . The duty must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a foreign land . ' The liability to duty arises the // moment the goods have passed the boundary line . Where , however , goods are passing through the territory , and from the time of their entry up to the time of their exit are in the control of the revenue officials , the liability to duty is not created . Moreover , goods brought across the line and stored in warehouses under the supervision and control of the revenue officials , while dutiable , are not called upon to pay the customs dues until their release for circulation . ' The general presumption is that all goods coming from a foreign land are free of duty . ' Only those wares are subject to customs dues which are included in the classification of the tariff law . That is to say , all goods may enter the country free of duty , unless the law specifically declares to the contrary . As to the nature of the liability to customs duties , from a juristic standpoint , Laband says that " the obligation to pay duty is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no obliga- // do ex lege , but a charge upon the dutiable article . The State does not allow the goods to circulate unless the duty has been paid . The payment of the duty is the condition under which the State permits commerce with the wares , and the obligation arises only in the sense that everyone who wishes to bring goods into free circulation must first of all fulfil the condition . The liability , therefore , does not rest , as a species of obligation , upon a certain debtor , but as a kind of dingliches Recht , ' upon a certain ware . " ' The goods , therefore , are held liable for the duty laid upon them and may be detained or attached by the Customs Administration . ' An attachment takes away every right of disposition from the holder of the goods , and creates a lien in favor of the Fiscus , who may eventually sell the wares and apply the proceeds to the payment of the same . ' An attachment of this sort takes precedence of every other claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods for the payment of the duty excluded by the rights which third parties may have in the dutiable articles . The attached goods may not be pursued in the courts , nor by creditors or administrators in bankruptcy , before the duty has been paid thereon . ' In certain cases the imperial government may , by ordinance , increase the duty fixed in the tariff schedule . Such an increase may be made , for instance , in the case of goods from States which treat the ships or products of Germany more unfavorably than the ships and wares of other nations .
