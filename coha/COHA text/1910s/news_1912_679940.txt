txt At his two trials for the murder of STANFORD WHITES , H. K. TnAvg ? was able to command the services of many more or less expert alienists . At the second trial he was acquitted on the ground of insanity . An insane person - who takes the life of ' another can not be convicted of murder . The law requires that , when acquitted on the ground of insanity , the prisoner shall be committed to an asylum for the criminal insane , and shall be kept there until he becomes sane . Tnaw will never become sane . His insanity Is incurable , and it is of a type recognized by all the highest authorities as dangerous and homicidal . Yet another attempt is to be made to get this murderous lunatic out of Matteawan , and to set him free . Such attempts have been made before , and have failed . When the last attempt was made it was once more judicially determined that THAW is , and remains , insane . Ss long as he is insane , the law requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never become sane , this means that unless the law is overruled he will never be set at large . There is only one reason ' why any further attempt should be made to get Taa.w out of Matteawan . That reason is the Thaw money . If he were without means nobody would entertain the idea that he should be brought before a Judge to have his mental condition inquired into . But a large fortune is available for the use of THAW in his attempts , or the attempts made in his behalf , to override the law which decrees his confinement . The mere beginning of proceedings for his enlargement shows that there is , in fact , one law for the poor and quite another for the rich ; the success of the attempt would be a startling demonstration of the ability of a rich man , and in this case a very dangerous man , to get around the law . We are always being told that a. rich man need not fear the law . It appears that proof of that statement is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the highest authority have pronounced TI1AW incurably insane . That his insanity is of the homicidal types , of course , put 1 beyond all doubt y his murder of WHITE . But the identification of his state of mind as homicidal , as one that would prompt him to take the life of some other human being , or more than one , rests upon evidence inde-pendent of the crime for which he was I tried . It is as certain as anything can be that if , through the use of his money , THA.Mr gets free , he will kill somebody . Inasmuch as there can no longer be any reasonable doubt of his i incurable insanity  --  it is only because he is a rich man that the question is raised at all  --  it is proper to ask how far those who aid and abet his attempts to get out of Matteawan will ) be accessories in the crimes he will commit , and to what degree the guilt ' of the blood he IT certain to shed will rest upon them .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
