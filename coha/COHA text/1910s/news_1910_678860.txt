txt Senator Jeff Davis of Arkansas , in a personal plea before the House Committee on Public Lands to-day , tried in vain to induce the committee to strike from its records the Senator 's own admission that he had an interest as a lawyer in the subject matter of a bill to advocate which he had appeared before the committee . The statement as to his interest in the bill Mr.1 Davis made before the committee some days ago in explaining his support of the measure , but when the stenographer 's notes on the hearing were submitted to him he struck out the admission and modified it . When seen this afternoon in regard to the incident before the House Committee Mr. Davis , after declaring that there had been an error on the stenographer 's part , warned the newspaper men against printing anything " derogatory to my character. - He threatened papers publishing " derogatory " accounts of the incident with serious consequences , but said that he would himself issue no statement " until I see what the press says about me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement cuaracterizing the whole affair as " a sensational story gotten out by my jealous political enemies to injure me at home . " The bill in question was introduced by Representative Oldfield of Arkansas and provided for quieting title to about 100.000 acres of swamp lands in the eastern part of Arkansas known as Sunk Lands . " They are claimed in part by the United Stales , the St. Francis Levee Board , and private individuals . Admitted He Wan Retained . It had been admitted by Senator Davis that he was the attorney for the St. Francis Levee Board of the State of Arkansas , which claimed title to the lands tinder a State grant , and for which board he brought suit against a number of persons who had cut timber on the lands . The land was sold ln many cases , it is stated , for an acre , but the timber was reported to be worth from $10 to $25 per acre . In his first appearance before ihw cornmutee the records showed that Senator Davis made the following statement : " We could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that much of selfishness in it to me because there is a good fee if I can recover the price of that timber . I do not care whom it goes to , whether it goes to the State of Arkansas or the St. Francis Levee Board , but I would rather it stroll go to the St. Francis Levee Board , because that is just and right . " In correcting his testimony Senator Davis struck out the words " because there is a good fee if I can recover t he price of that timber . " and substituted for them the following : " Because I am the attorney for the St. Francis Levee Board for the recovery of this timber . " Senator Davis asserted before the committee to-day that he had not used the words attributed to him , but several members of the committee disagreed with him and declared that he did make the statement . The effort on Mr. Davis 's part to modify the record was what called the nature of the situation to the attention of the committee . Mr. Davis was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written , and it was to overcome that difficulty that Mr. Davis appeared before the committee to-day . Although he told the commiaqe that he had been misquoted by the stenographer and that hip corrected statement was the true version of his words . Mr. Davis is again quoted , however , in the committee record of today as specifying unmistakably. that he was to receive an " absolute fee as well as a contingent fee. - After considering the Senator 's request for an hour this ' morning in executive session , the House Committee decided that Mr. Davis must Stand by his admission . To Race Contingent Fee . During Senator Davis 's appearance before the committee to-day . Representative Robinson of Arkansas , a member of the committee , inquired : " Is this a contingent fee ? " " I have an absolute as well as a contingent fee , " replied the Senator . Representative Pickett  --  Does the contingent fee involve favorable consideration by Congress ? " Senator Davis  --  I ca n't say . If the title is conferred upon the State of Arkansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bill is one which Mr. Davis persuaded Mr. Oldfield to introduce for him . The Senator first tried to get Representative Joseph T. Robinson to introduce the bill for him , but Mr. Robinson refused . He then approached Mr. Oldfield , who consented . It is said that Mr. Oldfield understood that Mr. Davis v  --  ould himself assume some of the responsibility by introducing the measure at the same time in the Senate , but so far Mr. Davis has not introduced the bill in his own name . Whether Mr. Davis 's failure to introduce the measure under his own name frightened Mr. Oldfield or not does not appear , but recently the Representative did become alarmed and tried to reeall the measure . He had at the outset marked the bill as " introduced by request , " to that extent disclaiming authorship . He then went to the committee and later to the Speaker in an effort to have the bill withdrawn . but at both places he was told that the bill could be withdrawn only by a vote of the House . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Federal Laws Strict . There are on the Federal statute books many laws directed against the practice of members of Congress appearing before the departments or committees of Congress in the interest of claimants against the United States . Several years ago ex-Senator Burton of Kansas , on conviction of practicing before the Post Office Department during his term of service , was expelled from the Senate and imprisoned . Other statutes fix the penalties for practicing for pay before committees of Congress . Section 110 of the , new Criminal Code is as follows : Whoever being elected or appointed a. member of or delegate to Congress or a resident Commissioner shall , after his election or appointment and either before or after he is qualified and during his continuance In office , directly or indirectly ask , accept , receive , or ' agree to receive any money , property , or other valuable consideration or any promise , contract , understanding , obligation , gratuity. or security for . the payment of money or for the delivery or conveyance of anything of value to him or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for his attention to , or services , or with intent to have his action , vote , or decision Influenced on any question , matter , cause of proceeding which may at any time he pending in either House of Congress or before any committee thereof , or which by law or under the Constitution may be brought before him In his official capacity . or In his place as such member , delegate , or resident Commissioner , shall be fined not more . than three times the amount asked , accepted , or received , and Imprisoned not More than three years , and shall , moreover , forfeit his office and thereafter be forever disqualified from holding any office of honor , trust , or profit under the Government of the United States . Senator Davis was in a fighting mood this afternoon when newspaper men tried to get a statement from him . He repeated several times his injunction that nothing be printed until the record of the committee was published , and declared that he had nothing to say . To a friend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all would come out all right . " Just keep quiet and keep your powder dry , " he said to the telephone , ? ? and it will be all right . The right always wins. - What complicated the matter still mo , ? e was that at the first hearing on the bill Mr. Davis told the committee that his colleague . Mr. Clarke of Arkansas , also ; favored the bill . Mr. Clarke heard of this statement to-day , and he at once told Mr. Davis that he opposed the measure and always had opposed it . The two men then went before the committee and Mr. Davis told the Representatives that he had been mistaken about Mr. Clarke 's support of the measure . " Instead of being for the bill , as you said , " cried Mr. Clarke rather warmly . " I was opposed to it , and am against it now . " I " Well , " said Mr. , Davis . considerably crestfallen , " a man named Williams told me that you were for the bill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking me. " continued Mr. Clarke , somewhat mollified , and so the Incident ended . The statement issued by Senator Davis to-night is devoted mostly to an exposition of the merits of the bill Mr. Oldfield tried to withdraw . He exonerates Mr. Oldfield of any interest in the bill , and says it was introduced at his own request . The part of the statement referring to the fee he was expecting is as follows : Senator Davis , when seen in regard to the story that he was to get a fee in the event that House bill No. 19. t.MT. by Mr. Oldfield , became a law , stated that that report was absolutely raise and without foundation . He stated mat this was just a bill intended to quiet the title to certain sunk and overflow ed lands ht Arkanses to the grantees of the St. Francis Levee Board , who are a number of his friends living in Arkansas , at Forrest City . When asked by the members of the committee whether or not this bill would help his suit for these timber depredations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say whether or not that would be the case , and this Is all there Is to the story . If the bill should become a law it would not affect the St. Francis Levee Board in the least ; neither would it affect his fee or employment with it against these timber depredations .   e. says that this Is a sensational story got up by his jealous political enemies to in , 7are him at home ; that there is not a word of truth in it , and- that he stands ready at all times to defend his action in regard to this bill . Among Senators to-day rumors of the events before the House committee seemed to cause more amusement than anything ' else . Mr. Davis 's vigorous oratorical attacks on the " Interests " have been the subject of mirth since he entered the Senate . Representative alcifield said regarding the bill : " I introduced the bill in question at the request of Senator Davis . and had no interest whatever in the matter . I have not at any time stood sponsor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Francis Levee Board is a State board appointed by the Governor of the State of Arkansas . The board bases its claim to the land on a grant from the State which received its title from the Federal Government under the Swamp act of 18.10 . The Interior Department in December . 19118 , made a ruling that the original surveys of this land were incorrect and that the land reverted to the Federal Government by a compromise act between the United States and the State of Arkansas in 1598 . Following this decision large numbers of settlers moved upon the land .
