A CORRESPONDENT of the Easy Chair , who claims to be typically middle class , but who is possibly either an I. W. W. or a multimillionaire , writes us of a matter which he holds is peculiarly interesting to people of his alleged rank in life . The matter is the well-known matter of tipping , not to call it the nuisance , the curse . He appears to think we have never treated of it , and he wishes us to do so , because of a recent hopeful experience of his ; but our impression is that we have often deplored this evil , and tried to point escape from it ; though very likely we have read so much about it that we imagine ourselves to have written of it when we have only been darkened by the counsel of other philosophers . In any case the fact apparently remains that there is but one public house in the United States of America where the wayfaring man may arrive , eat , sleep , and depart without having at least a dozen hands held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the generous charge of the office . But the fact that there is one such house is evidence that every hotel in the country may be conducted on the same principle , and the suffering middle class relieved from the burden that now rests more heavily upon it than upon any other class . We are reporting the contention of our correspondent here , and we are by no means siding with him yet in his premise or conclusion , though we may come to that before we get through , and may end by espousing the cause of a class which has neither the picturesqueness of dire poverty nor the glamour of great riches . The middle class is , in fact , rather repulsive to the prouder instincts , and it is hard to give it any sort of sympathy in its woes . People whose incomes oblige them to be continually watching their outgoes do not appeal either to the pity or the reverence of the Easy Chair . Lifted above their necessity , or sunk below it , according to its changing mood , the Easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and give its correspondent the hearing which it will try to keep from turning into a free advertisement for that one tipless hotel of our continent . There is , indeed , one other tipless hotel in Christendom , and this in the very center of the heart of tipping , that is to say in London itself . From time to time it is rumored that this house is a failure , and that it has gone back to tipping like all the other hotels of Europe ; but the testimony of our correspondent is that it is more flourishing than ever ? so much so that if you want a room in it you must apply five or six weeks ahead . When it was first opened it was the experience of the Easy Chair to be turned roomless from its door , together with multitudes who proposed at least lunching there , but could not get within sight of the restaurant , such was the pressure to realize the fact that no waiter there could be even bribed to take a tip . As for our correspondent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engages a room at that hotel six weeks ahead when he is going to London , and has his place in the restaurant secured for him at the same time . In his letter to us he notes but he does not too patriotically dwell on the fact that the tipless hotel in America practised its true hospitality years before its generous sister - hostelry , in London , though he celebrates in graphic terms the joy of going to that home of peace in a hostile world of tips . When he drives or motors up to its door , the doorman opens to him with no anthropophagous greed in his eye , and the bell-boy who goes up with him in the elevator unlingeringly leaves him in his room with no insidious suggestion of ice-water . The porter arrives and puts his trunk in a convenient place , without trying to found a pecuniary claim upon his carefulness . At the door of the diningroom there is no exasperating boy to take his hat , or his scalp in default of it , and look him out of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forecast an unwilling acknowledgment from him in giving him a table ; the waiter assigned him forbears to tempt him to an excessive order in the hope of a large percentage on the outlay . Every detail of the service throughout his stay in the house is marked by the same decent restraint , and when he goes he abandons himself to the taxi-cab with both hands in his pockets . The very taxi-cab has been ordered for him , and ho will he safe from overcharge in it , but he does not say what passes between him and the chauffeur when he reaches the station ; perhaps it is a quarter . He owns himself a helpless prey to tipping when exposed to it , and he contrasts his experience in this tipless hotel with his experience in any and every other hotel in this country . What that experience is we all know from our own remembrance of the passions of fear , rage , and shame which spring from the incidents and circumstances of the odious ordeal . There is perhaps no phase of our false conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tipping which now attaches itself to almost every relation of " hireling and him that hires . " This is what our correspondent says , and it is in this that we heartily agree with him , though we are not so sure that we think hotel - tipping the worst kind of tipping . Why should a man who has paid forty or fifty cents for having his hair cut pay the man who has cut it ten cents more ? Why should he give the expressman who bangs his trunk down in his apartment fifteen or twenty cents more than the company 's outrageous charge ? Why should he add twenty or twenty-five cents to the sum that the chauffeur has already extorted from him by his lying clock ? The answer is simple : because he thinks others do it , and is afraid not to do it . He dreads the barber 's , expressman 's , chauffeur 's scorn , or the show of it ; they may not really despise him if he does not do it ; they may hate to have him do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We all know what the griefs of the tipper are , for they are our own , especially if we are of that middle class with which we have explained that one can have little sympathy , because it is neither picturesque nor splendid . But the griefs of the tipped are as yet almost unknown because the tipped are not very articulate , and because their sorrows are mixed with a shame which they are loath perhaps to expose . We tippers have often voiced our sense of the black ingratitude which the tipped often show in receiving the gifts which their rapacity extorts . We have told how they hover over us , with every servile incitement to profuse expense in us , and then when we have left half-eaten the food which we have ordered , quit us sometimes with no thanks at all for our bounty , or with a nonchalant acknowledgment hard upon insolence , and of one make with impertinence . Have not we felt , if we do not own , the pitiful doubt whether we should give thirty or twenty-five cents ; have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off for twenty cents ? We ourselves , before our superfluity mounted into the millions , had to watch our outgoes ; we , too , had to guard against their passing our income ; we , too , have practised matching our middle - class grudge with that lowerclass greed . Yet now , such is our fine oblivion of the past in the tide of our present prosperity , we confess again that we sympathize rather with the lower-class greed than the middle-class grudge . Perhaps this is because poverty and riches are mystically allied in a contempt for the golden mean which seems to them both a leaden meanness . We are aware that if we had been always as wealthy as we are now , we would not have poorly sought to fob the waiter off with twenty or twentyfive or thirty cents , but would have magnificently pushed a five or , for all we know , a ten dollar bill toward him , as we have read of opulent people doing . We have even read of opulent people , or at least one opulent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of a steamer voyage , and we are not sure that we shall give less if ever we cross the Atlantic again . The steward may direly need it , and if he does " ' Tie what the happy to the unhappy owe , " as Mr. Pope 's Homer says upon the occasion of any signal benefaction in the course of the Odyssey , and we may hereafter pay such debts as we go . But for the moment , as we recall , it is not the question of us upper-class profligates , but of the middle , the bourgeois , the citizen class , who by the mere dint of their numbers do most of the tipping , and the grudging that goes with it , and we are anxious not to shirk our plain duty in treating of their sufferings and their sorrows . At the same time we have as clear a duty to the lower class greed which preys upon that grudge ? to the under-dog which in the battle of life is always stretching a rapacious paw from the dust . Tipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inverts the effect of the heavenly attribute which it mocks ; it curses him that gives and him that takes , but most it curses him that takes . We do not have the fact from the taker ; as we have said , he has contributed little or nothing to general knowledge in the matter ; but there is a sort of universal parity in human nature which enables us rightly to judge , or at least to divine , the case of the poor man , though we are now so rich , and were once merely so comfortably well off . We are confident that no man ever yet received a money gift from another without a sense of degradation and a loss of selfrespect . Of course , custom hardens , and each successive gift imparts a fainter throe ; the sting of shame is dulled more and more to the calloused soul , but it is always the sting of shame . We do not believe it possible for a man earning an honest living to take money which he has not earned without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , the waiter who goes away with the grudge-stained middle-class tip in his pocket , with or without thanking the giver for it , comforts himself with the theory that it is part of the honest living that he has earned ; but at the bottom of his heart he must know that the tipper does not think so . He must know that the tipper believes himself choused , plundered , robbed in his tip , and loathes him in the proportion of it . The tipper has paid quite enough for his dinner , and has eaten it in the convention that the charge for it includedthe service , and yet he has been forced to pay for the service over again ; and not only to do this , but to guess at the worth of the service or the expectation of the servant . Was a middleclass man ever so confident of the just apportionment of the reward to the hope of the rewarded as to be sure that he was not going away with a sense of unsatisfied greed and a low opinion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair had his anxieties too as to the size of the tip , and wondered whether it would be thirty or twenty-five or , pitifully , twenty cents ? The tipper is not the only one who has had his heart in his mouth , or has trembled in that darkness as to the sum , which no tipper , tip he ever so often , ever rightly knows . Perhaps the tipped has suffered even more poignantly from the uncertainty . The only certainty concerning the till is that it is altogether wrong . It had its bad beginning in the largess flung to slaves , and descended to us from what the old - fashioned travelers called the " trifling gratuity " which they bestowed upon the servants in a foreign inn . Like graft , it is " wholly un-American " in spirit , and , like graft , it is now characteristically American . Before the Civil War it was almost unknown ; after that we began to flock abroad , and to bring it back with Ile . It is as distinctly of European origin as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as yet we have not discovered any parasite that will keep it in check . It has spread everywhere through the country , so that now the most innocent rural district is not free from its ravages . At first the - tourists who encountered the custom in Europe sent up such lamentable cries that the reverberation alarmed the simpleminded European inn - keepers , and in some of their hotels there were placards vividly forbidding tips to be given or taken . All the same , they were given and taken , and the plague raged as before . Other devices were practised to mitigate the plague ; we remember an agreeable tea-room in Paris where you gave no tip , but might put your gratuity , as trifling as you chose , on the counter as you went out , and suffer no shame for your guess at the right amount if you guessed wrong . Custom has indeed approximately ascertained the right amount in Europe , where they have a parasite for the gipsy and the brown-tail moth ; but hero no man , nor woman neither , knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of abolishing the custom in the newspapers ; the editors write against it , and their readers write to them and thank them ; but hitherto nothing has been done except in that one hotel , which we are so resolutely keeping secret . There is no reason , however , no scruple that need oblige us to secrecy concerning the means by which this inspired hostelry has freed its guests and servants from their common curse . The management has imagined paying the employees a sufficient wage , and the device has worked perfectly . Where the other hotels pay a man thirty dollars a month , this hotel pays him sixty dollars a month . It may seem incredible , but this has ended tipping there . The managers of the other hotels regard it as a harmless joke , a thing not to he seriously considered in their relations to the public ; and it is hard even for a guest in that exemplary house to believe it . At first he confidently offers his tip . and when he is duly put to shame by having it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willingly served as if the waiter had been put to shame by receiving it . By and by he gets to liking the conditions , and abides by them as implicitly as the servant must on pain of being discharged if he violates them . An ideal justice would of course work the expulsion of a guest who gave a tip as inexorably as the present system works the discharge of the servant who takes it ; but they have not , yet come to the ideal justice even in Hotel Utopia . We veil its identity under a pseudonym , though we have long believed Utopia is the only country that has ever really existed . Other countries make a factitious appearance on the map , just as the other hotels which permit and encourage tipping have a factitious effect of business while underpaying their servants and letting them collect from their guests the balance of the wages due . Nobody who has realized the self - respectful comfort of Hotel Utopia would go to any other hotel if he could help it . He is no more molested by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and nowhere else on our tip-blighted continent is be served so kindly and promptly . We do not know that this house is so anticipatively thronged as that tipless hotel in London , and if we had not pledged ourselves so piously to conceal its identity we are sure that our readers would deluge us with demands for rooms in it . As it is , we feel that they will respect our vow , and we hope they will not tempt us beyond our strength in the case of any other hotel following its example . The example is worthy of emulation beyond other good examples because it was in the hotels that the plague of tipping first broke out on our shores , and they have a peculiar duty to the public in being the first to attempt its cure . It is possible , of course , that the disease has now gone so far and so deep that it can not be wholly extirpated , but we should like to have the experiment generally tried in the hope of a partial amelioration . We are sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay his service twice the present wages on condition that no tips should be given ; but if the tips continued to be offered we know that the porters and bell - boys and waiters and chambermaids would still rejoice together in the increase of their wages , and would try their best to refuse the tips .
