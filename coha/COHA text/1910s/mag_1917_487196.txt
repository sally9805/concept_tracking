PRESIDENT ELIOT does not agree with President Wil-son . The veteran of Harvard is despondent . Last October he came to the conclusion that the war had drifted into a stalemate ; that neither side could conquer ; and that upon that understanding peace negotiations ought to be initiated . Now he appears to believe that the war is to leave the world very much as before , except that America will be forced for her own safety to load herself down with armaments after the European fashion . Mr. Eliot sees nothing for it except compulsory and universal service in the United States . He is not , of course , alone in this position . There has been much talk in the press about the desirability of seizing the present opportunity to fasten universal military service upon our nation . Bills to effect it have been introduced in Congress . But the Secretary of War , in his annual report , takes the ground that nothing should be done to determine our permanent military system until the war ends and we find out whether disarmament all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it clear that his view is the same . He would defer action until we know what action , if any , is desirable . This being the attitude of the Administration , it is not to be expected that bills to establish universal military service will be pressed at this session . One thing should be clearly understood . if this country hurries into the kind of militarism that France and Italy and Germany and Austria have felt themselves forced to adopt , we shall be surrendering one , and perhaps the greatest , of our war aims . From the beginning until to-day , officially and semi-officially , by the utterances of President Wilson as by the assertions of the press and the deliverances of the pulpit , the United States has professed to be fighting for the establishment of the League of Nations , for an agreed disarmament , for international tribunals to hear and determine disputes between nations , and for an international police to keep the unruly in order . Americans said that they were girding on their armor in order to make it unnecessary for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were reluctantly setting to work to build up a great American armament for the purpose of warring against the whole system of competitive armaments . Hell had broken loose on earth and we were willing to send our young men into its fires so that we might make sure that such infernal outbreaks should never again afflict the world . Here , then , is a war aim which we have from the first put in the forefront . Are we now going to make haste to abandon it ? Are we going to be so faint of heart that we shall despair in advance of exacting such terms of peace as square with our avowed intentions from the beginning ? Nor is it merely a question of American war aims . The English are the same . So are the French . Mr. Asquith has repeatedly spoken of disarmament as one of the goals of the war . So has Lord Grey and Mr. Balfour and Lloyd George . Only this week we had a restatement of war aims by the English Labor party . It is admirably firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to France her own , but it is also explicit in the matter of insisting upon removing the burden of military armaments , after the war . French workingmen and Socialists have put themselves on record to the same effect . So have French statesmen . Disarmament as a result of the war is thus an Allied aim as well as an American . Why , we ask , this talk of giving it up before we are absolutely compelled to ? The thing is really as much a surrender of what we set out to do as it would be to declare that it was useless to fight in order to make Germany lift her military hoof off Belgium . Let us stick to our guns until we know whether the world will not decide , after the war , to put its faith in something other than guns In the reply of Germany and of Austria to the Pope there was a profession of willingness to agree to universal disarmament . The Austrian Government has since been explicit on the point . Count Czernin and the Austrian Minister of War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the scale previous to the war , to say nothing of their gigantic extension since . Now , we may sneer at these monkish professions of the devil sick , may call them rank inconsistency and poorly concealed hypocrisy , and all that . The fact remains , nevertheless , that the two nations of Europe which have shaped their policy for years on the basis of the highest armament possible have now publicly asserted their readiness to abandon the whole system . In other words , they have agreed in advance to this war aim of the United States . What sort of figure should we cut in cravenly giving up our great purpose just when the enemy was preparing to yield it ? The Investigation of the War Department x-To one in reading the testimony brought out in the in N vestigation in Washington should underestimate the task before the Secretary of War when hostilities began . No more stupendous problem was ever placed upon the shoulders of an official , for this war means not only the creation of an army , but the mobilizing of half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it been true as in this struggle that every soldier must have behind him civilians variously estimated at from six to ten persons . Mr. Baker had a corps of subordinates under him accustomed all their lives to dealing with an army ranging from 25,000 to 100,000 men , equipped and trained without thought of the possibility of European warfare . There was endless red-tape and routine thinking to be overcome , and , above all , a great new fighting force to be trained and officered , equipped and armed . Now , to expect that this could all be done in six months , without errors of judgment or mistakes of policy , is to demand the impossible . We are living in extraordinary times , but not in the days of magic . What Congress and the people wish to know now is , first , whether there were as few mistakes made as possible ; secondly , whether all the vast resources of the country were levied on as quickly and thoroughly as possible ; thirdly , whether the various bureaus in the War Department are functioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary himself has the necessary ability and vision ; and , fifthly , whether the delays in arming and equipping the troops now in cantonments were unavoidable . Finally , the country desires the assurance that its soldiers will at once be as well clothed as they are well fed . Now , it must be admitted that the testimony given by Gen. Crozier was not reassuring as to the ordnance situation . With machine guns a vital factor in any fighting , it appears that the United States will not be able to send a single new machine gun to France until April , and that the delay is owing to the time taken in adopting a new weapon , untried in field service , for which decision Gen. Crozier places the responsibility squarely upon the Secretary himself , stating that he was not and is not satisfied with the course proposed . There has long been a bitter controversy in the army as to the best type of machine gun , Gen. Wood favoring the Lewis , of which at least 20,000 are in service with the British and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the Benet-Mercier also has had its adherents . A year ago , in his annual report , Mr. Baker announced that the Board was at work picking out the best weapon ; but valuable time was apparently lost here , and then a new gun , the Browning , chosen . As for rifles , the forty-five divisions of the army , excepting those in France , have received less than one-third the rifles needed , and are drilling with a discarded weapon . While all the troops that have gone to France are well armed ? presumably taking two guns to a man  --  the military training of men in cantonments is greatly delayed for lack of rifles . Gen. Crozier admits that those troops who have gone to France left without adequate training in the use of their weapons . This difficulty was intensified by the decision of the War Department last summer to alter the British Lee-Enfield rifle as to calibre and breech-fitting to accommodate American standard ammunition and thus avoid the use of two kinds of ammunition . The question here is whether this decision was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the Enfield rifles for Great Britain . If they could have turned all their resources to the production of rifles for our army , it is asserted , there would be weapons in plenty both for the existing army and for the one to come . It is only fair to add that the head of the Marines , Gen. Pershing , Mr. Baker , the Chief of the War College , and the Chief of Staff agreed with the Ordnance Department that the correct course was followed . Gen. Crozier states positively that if we had commandeered all rifle and gun factories for our own purposes in April last , we should gravely have handicapped our allies , for whom many are working night and day . As to heavy ordnance , there is no doubt that the situation is worse , and , whether proper expedition was used after the great appropriation of June , 1916 , for preparation , and whether the ordnance efforts were sufficiently speeded up in January , February , and March of this year when war seemed to most of the high officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we take it , the crux of the inquiry , next to the question of present efficiency . It is an astounding fact that of the $100,000,000 of the emergency appropriation of April last not a dollar has been used for ordnance purposes , just as it is amazing to learn that it was not until two months after war was declared that Mr. Baker 's machine-gun board , which began work as far back as the summer of 1916 , decided on the new Browning weapon . All the artillery we are using in Ftance is given us by France or England . Finally , we warn again that this is no time to make shrill accusations . Secretary Baker has yet to be heard , and other officials , and the difficulties of the task are not to be overlooked for a moment . In every one of the Allied nations there have been similar difficulties , notably in England . Whatever the mistakes , we believe that it will be demonstrated that in Secretary Baker the United States has an official of most unusual devotion and ability , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attained . We can not believe that he permitted any undue delay or that he has failed to usethe brightest minds in the War Department , but it is plain that there will have to be a complete reorganization of that Department to fit the altered conditions , and this , the dispatches report , is now begun . That , too , would be merely paralleling the Allied experience . Certain it is that no more troops should be called out until clothing and rifles in plenty are on hand for them ; to do otherwise would be wasteful and of no advantage at all . Defending Waste WHAT I admire in all this , " said Dr. Johnson , standing before a great country estate , " is its total disregard of expense . " Something of this noble disdain appears to have entered into the Secretary of the Treasury . In his recent address at Washington in behalf of loans and war savings , Mr. McAdoo magnificently inquired , " What do we care about waste ? " He added , naturally , that he meant only waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took , all the same , a very easy-going position in regard to extravagance . There is always waste when war comes , averred the Secretary . Let us , however , " not think of the waste of dollars . " " Let us not carp about expenditures , and so give aid and comfort to our enemies . " Such sentiments , which can so readily be construed in favor of lavish policies , come peculiarly with ill grace from a Secretary of the Treasury . We would not do Mr. McAdoo the unfairness of judging the whole tenor of his address by the brief extracts published . It is unfortunately the case that he has more than once failed to take sufficient care in getting his exact ideas before the public . Any utterance by the man in charge of the national finances ought to be well weighed , and given to the press in correct form . Nor are we denying that there is a certain force in what the Secretary said about the necessary extravagances of a war . Emergency cost is notoriously high ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy and build many things in an emergency . It is probably the case , also , that more or less experimenting has to be done , in order to ascertain what are the best standards in army and navy supplies and equipment ; and this inevitably means apparent money losses . The sums spent in finding out what not to do may seem gratuitous waste , though in reality they may prove in the long run to be economy . All this and much more of the same sort we freely admit . What jars , however , is the implication that waste in Government war expenditure is wholly negligible ; that with billions to spend it is ridiculous to complain of the losing of mere millions ; and that the proper attitude for the Government to take is " Hang the expense . " The argument is that the necessary outlay is so tremendous that we ought not to concern ourselves over trifling waste here and there . In reality , the logic ought to run the other way . The very fact that the Government has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for the most jealous watch over expenditure . It may seem delicate flattery to Uncle Sam to tell him that he is so rich that he does not need to care for petty savings , but we think the old gentleman would like it better to be assured that the Treasury into which he is pouring his money has vigilant watchdogs to prevent its being wasted . The fact is that the bigger the amounts that have to be raised by taxes and loans , the more rigid ought to be the spirit of economical administration . The country is in no spendthrift mood , and does not want its officials to be either . For needless Government waste no defence is possible , though Secretary McAdoo , by the grandiloquent language he used , came near attempting it . Every dollar thrown away means a dollar more to be taken from the people in taxes or by borrowings . It is of no avail to say that the country has now become so habituated to thinking and talking in billions that extravagances running into the hundred thousand do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinch and deny themselves . Governmental waste , translated into terms of the family budget , simply means giving up more than would otherwise be necessary . All of us , in truth , are exhorted by the Government to be sparing and thrifty . We are asked to save food and fuel and transportation ; to avoid luxurious expenditures . Does it not , then , fall disagreeably on our ears when a Secretary of the Treasury talks loftily about forgetting all about waste in the use of public money , and bids us cease to inquire carefully into Government war outlay lest we bring joy to the heart of the Kaiser ? War is synonymous with waste , there is no doubt of that . Not only does it destroy vast amounts of capital as completely as if it were thrown into the sea , but in the process of getting destruction ready it is the prince of squanderers . This we must sorrowfully recognize . But it furnishes no reason for not saving all that can be snatched away ; for not safeguarding war expenditures in every way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government economy as rigidly as upon private . How far away , in these lavish days , seems the second inaugural of Grover Cleveland ! It was a Franklinesque plea for thrift in public administration , for not taking from the people a penny more than was needed . But that fashion of sympathizing with the daily struggle of the citizen who is a child of poverty , or a man of moderate means , seems now quite obsolete . The newer way is to create immense funds at the disposal of the Government , and then ladle them out right and left with fine disregard of the expense . Facts About Coal THE disquieting evidence of a coal shortage in the Middle and Eastern States is daily more plain . Every newspaper reader has before him the account of how Gov . Cox has , after a month 's suffering in Ohio , summarily taken control of thousands of coal cars within reach , how industrial concerns and a great shipyard have closed in Baltimore , how there has been rioting in Brooklyn . Chicago and Kansas City report that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Michigan , as in Ohio , coal has been parcelled out a ton at a time , and Detroit stated December 1 that " the situation is serious for both domestic and steam coal users . " In Philadelphia there was no free coal December 1 , and the shortage threatens to cause suffering at any time , while New England 's industrial interests fear an imminent curtailing of activity . Every one knows what the basic cause is  --  the immensely increased consumption , estimated at 100,000,000 tons more this year than last . The latest commerce reports show that we are exporting little more coal than in 1916 ; in the first eight months of this year we had sent out 17,375,000 tons as against 15,600,000 in the same period last year . The increase of less than 2,000,000 tons , most ofwhich went to Canada and Cuba , is a trifle . But our greatly expanded home consumption has been long foreseen . Both the mine operators and the railways will face a considerable responsibility for the failure to produce and move about 690,000,000 tons of anthracite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year . This was a tremendous demand to make , especially when we consider that last year 's production was itself nearly 60,000,000 tons in advance of any previous year . But by straining every nerve , they might have come nearer meeting the demand . The anthracite mines have done all that was required of them . Their share would have been a 17 per cent . expansion over last year ; in April and May they had reached a 24 per cent . expansion , and they have kept their mark higher than any one expected . The bituminous operators have shown at times a painful want of diplomacy in dealing with labor , and strikes in late autumn particularly cut their production . The output to October 31 was 454,326,000 tons , which is about 40,000,000 tons more than the production last year in the same period ; that is , about 10 per cent . more . For a time in October the rate of increase over 1916 was much slowed down , but lately it has risen . Mr. Garfield made a strenuous effort in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary times , " he stated , " account for the fact that the average number of days ' work in the year has been from 200 to 230 only . They also account for the fact that the average hours of labor per day have fallen considerably below the eight hours stipulated in wage agreements . " The agreement concluded in the Central district provides for at least forty hours weekly , guaranteed by a system of forfeitures . The November showing will be good , production for the first fortnight reaching 22,650,000 tons . But even this is only 77.8 per cent . of full-time capacity . The year will probably close with a total coal production of little over 50,000,000 tons more than in 1916 . But operators strongly and justly protest that the shortage is , in its present aspects , due largely to difficulties of transportation . The Geological Survey computes that for the week ending November 3 the deficiency below full-time output was about 3,925,000 tons , of which about 1,720,000 tons was due to shortage of cars . That week was one of lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been more acutely felt as the coal piled up . Early in November Illinois and Indiana reported a loss in coal output of from 6.6 per cent . to 15 per cent. , owing to the shortage of cars and locomotives . At the same time there was a " material increase " in the losses traceable to it in the Pittsburgh and Freeport districts in the East ; there was little improvement in a rather bad situation in the Pocahontas , Fairmont , and West Virginia fields , and in the Cumberland and Piedmont fields there was a loss of nearly 15 per cent . The Coal Mining Review asserts that " when the transportation problem is solved there will be no fuel problem with which the Fuel Administration will have to wrestle . There will be no work for the hundreds of men employed by the Government to plan increased production of coal , and there will be no prospective fuel famine to prevent . " The Coal Age notes a slight labor shortage , but states that " the production of bituminous coal appears to be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan , West Virginia , and Ohio Fuel Administrators with railway men and operators resolved that it is " apparent that the shortage of motive power and congestion of terminal facilities on practically all railways are the two factors responsible ! ' The Government has ordered that no open-top cars shall be used except for the transportation of coal , ore , food , or fertilizers , and more recently has tried to obtain priority for all shipments of coal . All the remedies within the reach of goaded operators , overburdened railways , and a Government doing what it can with priority orders and pooling arrangements at terminals will not prevent the necessity of sharp economy . On the estimate that our navy and factories require a hundred million tons more than before , and will get little over half that , Mr. Garfield issues the warning that unless we save fifty million tons the Government will see non-essential industries shut down in order to provide for essential uses . Every householder , factory manager , and engine fireman must do his part to make this enormous saving possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was asserted that much more than this could be conserved by proper methods .
