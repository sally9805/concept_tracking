txt After a bitter fight the Assembly at 2:30 o'clock this morning passed a revised version of the so-called Sage compensation rider over which the Senate and Assembly have been in deadlock for weeks . Gov . Whitman sent in an emergency message to make the passage of the bill possible , although it had not been available for the required three days . The vote of the ** was 82 for the rider and 54 against . The Republican leaders in the Assembly again were compelled to resort to the caucus as a means of driving recalcitrant members of the Assembly majority into line . it was before the opening of the night session , which had been called especially for the purpose of putting this bill through , that the Republican Assemblymen were summoned into caucus . There the question of whether the bill should be made a party measure or not was put to them squarely . The leaders carried their point , but not until after thirteen of the ninety-one members who attended the caucus had joined in the bolt . Finally they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the leaders that they would not be required to bind themselves to abide by the result , but would be left free to vote on the measure according to the dictates of their conscience . In its revised form the rider provides for the direct settlement of compensation claims and the direct payment of compensation to injured workmen lay their employers , without the intervention of the Compensation Commission . In its original form the bill directly recognized the casualty companies writing compensation insurance as factors in such direct settlements . This provision ostensibly has been eliminated from the amended measure . but opinions differ as to whether the amended bill will not have the same effect in this respect that it would have had in its unamended form . At a recent hearing at the Capitol , the measure which then came as a " rider " to the bill providing an emergency appropriation of $425,000 for the support of ' the Compensation Corn-Mission , was opposed by representatives of every labor , union in the State . Assemblyman John Leo Sullivan of Chautauqua County led the fight against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The caucus had been in session for almost two hours before the first bolter appeared in the Assembly chamber , where the Democratic members ; the newspaper correspondents , and a few hundred spectators were marking time . The lawmakers who were waiting indulged in all sorts of pranks , and from time to time little groups burst into song While this was going on Assemblyman Fred J. Milligan , Jr. , of Kings , followed closely by Assemblyman ' Charles H. Duff of Kings , burst into the Assembly chamber from the Ways and Means room , where the caucus was being held . Mr. Milligan was very red in his face . Mr. Duff was pale and trembling . " They virtually told us to get out , " said Mr. Milligan , " after we had told them a thing or two . " Apparently laboring under great excitement , half a dozen Republican Senators were lobbying on the floor of the Assembly . Assemblyman Harold C.

" Just remember that your party is bigger than you are and that if you do n't do what you ' are told you will never come back here , " said the Senator brusquely . " But they have no right to make this a party measure , " said Mr. Duff , all a-tremor . " They have the right to do what they think best if the caucus says so , " said the Senator . " Yes , but there was n't a word in the Republican platform about changes in the Compensation act , " the Assemblyman rejoined . " No , " said the Senator , " But that does n't make any difference . If you know what will be good for you , you will go back . " About this time it became known that there were other bolters besides the two who had come into the Assembly chain ' ber .

Mr. Sullivan , who led the fight on the bill in the caucus , challenged the leaders to let the bill out on the floor on its merits and without making it a party measure . " If you do we 'll beat it ten to one , " chimed in Mr. Milligan . Just before the caucus vote was to be taken Secretary William A. Orr came up from the Executive Chamber . where the Governor was awaiting developments , and called Speaker Sweet out of the caucus room and down to the Governor 's office . ' When the Speaker returned the vote was taken . The Speaker by that time had received an emergency message which would make it lawful for the Assembly to waive the three-day provision and bring the bill to immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 13 at first . After the result had been announced by Assemblyman Machold , who presided , the insurgents then prepared to leave the room , but a goodly number were coaxed to remain in the room for appearance 's sake , as the leaders put it . Speaker Sweet told the members of his majority flock that if the bill was good enough for the Governor it ought to be good enough for them , and that the Governor 's emergency message really shifted the responsibllity from their shoulders to his . The Speaker then airected that the names of those who had voted In the negative should be called again , and said he would give the recalcitrants a ( hence to repent . At the same time the Speaker announced that if for any reason a Republican who had been in the caucus felt that he could not consistently vote for the bill he would be free to vote against it without losing his regularity .

Thus the final vote in the caucus stood 82 to 0 . The debate at the session after the caucus was opened ' by Assemblyman Simon L.

SuPPort . - " You are committing political suicide , " said Assemblyman Martin G. McCue of New York , addressing the majority , " and you know it . You look it . You are . the most solemn bunch of mourners I ever saw walk behind a hearse , for I know you are brought into line by a party whip . wielded , I do n't know whether by party boss or party contributor .

" In . voting for this bill you vote for the pocket of one or two big men who receive large retainers from insurance companies and who know how to pull the levers here at Albany , " said Mr. Fish . " Who suggested the passage of this bill ? " exclaimed Assemblyman Sullivan . " I have asked that question in conference and I have asked it in caucus but I have received no direct or satisfactory answer . But I do know . that last August there sat in my office the Superintendent of . the Fidelity &; Casualty Company of New York . We were discussing legal matters .

" I realize very well that arguments of the nature I can afford will not avail to prevent the passage of this bill in the interest of the casualty companies . They have brought every sinister influence known to the political boss to bear on this situation . The members of the Republican majority in this House have been literally whipped into line by political bosses , who have been brought here from all over the State . " " I want to ask the gentleman if he has any proof in support of his statement regarding the bringing in of political bosses ? " asked Majority Leader Hinman when Mr. Sullivan .. finished . " I have enough evidence to convince any competent , fair-minded jury , " Mr. Sullivan replied . The majority leader did not press ' his inquiry .

Speaker Sweet himself left the rostrum and lobbied on the floor while the debate was in progress .
