txt The past fortnight in France has seen the assumption of a sort of leadership to which the changeful political history of that animated republic affords no close parallel . M. BRIAND , the Prime Minister and political head of the Government , on the morrow of the elections . determined on a policy quite different from that of any of his predecessors , and so much more vigorous than any he had himself followed previously that it was substantially a novelty . Briefly and broadly he decided co appeal for support . not to special groups in the majority which might for the time being be able to hold the bal. mace , but to the whole Republican Party . That is to say . he proposed to throw the responsibility of the continuance in office of the representatives of the party upon the party itself . In the past it has been the practice to maintain the required Pnrliamontary majority by a series of shifting combinations . or , as they would be called in this country , " deals " in which one after another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obviously this plan stimulated the formation of groups and prevented solidarity or consistency . The Government was forced to take up special lines of legislation according as one or another group was able to dictate to it . and a unified and comprehensive policy became impracticable . M. BRIAND has formulated a general line of policy for which as a whole he claims the support of all Republicans , and by this he definitely declares he will stand or fall . It embraces several projects  --  electoral reform in the direction of the election of Deputies on a general ticket for larger areas , with minority , or proportional , voting : reorganization of the administration , with more definite responribility for public employes ? reform in the finances ; reform in education , looking to the articulation of the various grades , to closer inspection of private schools . and to greater tolerance in matters of secta- rian differenims : and reform in the or ganization of " the national defense , " military and naval . Now these are - none of them measures which have not been discussed heretofore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ministry now announce that they will not dicker or trade one against another , but will argue them on their merits , and letv-t.he Chamber understand that the entire responsibility rests with members . In pursuing such a line M. BRIANI must necessarily lean heavily on public sentiment . He is admirably adapter to the use of this resource , and the par . liamentary system affords excellent opportunity for it The debate in the Chamber in which he explained lit proposed policy makes as interesting reading as anything in the history of modern politics . Unfortunately there is nothing comparable to such a debate possible in this country , partly because the part of the Legislature in our politics is independent and limited and partly because our Government is less centralized and the discussions of our Congress do not possess the same importanc1 . The tendency to what Sir CcrAnr.ss DILICE/ calls " omphalism " in the United States is , however , marked , and who knows but it ultimately may cause our papers to give as much attention to the Halls of Congress as , say , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
