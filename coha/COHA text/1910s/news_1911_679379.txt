txt The Tariff and Labor Cost . In its issue of Dec. 3 , in reply to an inquiry . The Outlook says : The present theory of protection maintained by the Republican Party is that the tariff is to protect American labor and that the protective duties should equal the differential between foreign labor cost and American labor cost . This , though The Outlook may not be unaware of It , Is as much as to say that protective duties should average not exceeding 10 per cent . ad valorem . This may be shown from the reports of the United States Labor Bureau in which appears the estimate of Carroll D. Wright that the average labor cost in thethilted States is 171. per cent of the cost of production , which last Is certainly less than the selling value . Many industries in which high wages are paid will show less than 10 per cent . as the labor cost . The differential between the labor cost here and abroad can hardly average as much as the whole labor cost , but , granting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the theory of the Republican Party Is that protective duties should average not over 10 per cent . ad valorem . In practice they average 50 per cent . ad valorem . Where the labor cost is particularly low , as in the textile trades , they are much higher than that .
