faces Germany . Unable to advance in the west , she finds herself , at the end of 1916 , in actual military occupation of Austria-Hungary and most of the Balkan Peninsula . The question for Hind ? enburg , therefore , is how so to use his tactical su ? periority as to make lasting a state of affairs , as fortunate as it was unplanned , which was originally not only not of Germany 's choice but against her choice , and which dates from the days when Ger ? mans openly said that Austria was less of a help than a hindrance . For an unexpected German em ? pire has come into being , not a willing hegemony but a de facto military autocracy , which can be made the foundation of a supremacy in Central Europe , Asia Minor and Persia brilliant beyond parallel in European history . It is the business of Hindenburg so to use the tactical superiority of the German military machine ( over enemies and allies alike ) on the various eastern fronts , as to force a conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now it has become a truism in this war that troops used defensively and properly entrenched can stand their ground against an enemy of su ? perior tactical value ( granted , of course , a satis ? factory morale ) although if used offensively , or in the open , these same troops be almost helpless . The British at Ypres , the Russians in front of Warsaw , stood off for weeks the best that Germany could bring against them . But these same British nor long afterwards , at Neuve Chapelle , showed that they did not comprehend offensive problems at all ; while the Russians were as children in German hands wherever there was a campaign of move ment . In the open fighting of the future Hindenburg is almost certain to defeat Russia , if not England . He can , if he chooses , first smash Cadorna and Sarrail , but such victories would in their very nature be indecisive . It is well known that Hinden ? burg and his faction believe that in the Riga cam ? paign of 1915 they were near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's encircling movement at Vilna failed because Falkenhayn pre ? ferred to send the German reinforcements else ? where . To win the war outright in the east , how ? ever , Russian resistance must be broken by the destruction of her armies . A separate peace with Russia is no part of the program of Hindenburg and the German eastern faction . The Russian armies are to be crushed by German tactical and technical superiority , and the terms of peace those of the victor to the vanquished . Unless forcibly imposed , those terms would not be acceptable even to the Black Hundreds of Petrograd . The Rus ? sian reactionaries desire neither victory nor defeat in this war . In victory they see the triumph ofthe democratic ideas of the west , in defeat the threat of a certain revolution in Russia . True standpatters , they want nothing changed : they are dangerous to Russia only when she is winning . Hindenburg 's victories , therefore , must be not dip ? lomatic , but decisive military victories . In order to achieve the objects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's military resistance . Whether or not this is possible remains the great question of 1917 . GERALD MORGAN . OF the gynocratic caste we call American " Society we are apt to speak as if it were a stable feature of American life ? unstable in its group composition , yes , but of an enduring framework . It is of the nature of caste to appear enduring . And yet , despite appearance , together with other bits of an archaic social system the American society life is being scrapped ? scrapped by women for themselves just as long since men began to scrap it for themselves . In a growing democracy it becomes more and more difficult to make yourself count through keeping others from counting , to work the principle of exclusiveness . In this country exclusiveness based on family lingers on only in isolated New England or Pennsylvania or southern communities , in certain Boston or Philadelphia or Balti ? more circles . Exclusiveness based on wealth or rather on its expenditure , remains a more workable principle . And vet given such opportunities for acquiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , caste ex ? clusiveness through consumption is but a flimsy principle . The would-he exclusive economic caste becomes inevitably a mere economic class whose boundaries are too readily crossed to be thought of as boundaries at all . Nor is it any easier for our gynocratic caste to keep to itself non ? economic distinctions in language , in bearing , in dressing , in ways of living in general : American habits of imitation make such caste distinctions short-lived . A caste which fails to exclude and which can rot keep to itself any cultural monopoly is certainly in danger of its life . Imitation and economic elasticity ? these are the enemies of our gynocratic caste from without . Within its organiza ? tion are other perils . It faces a shortage of leaders . In ? creasing outlets for feminine energy and ambition operate upon our gynocratic caste as increasing social opportunitie. , for the will to power among men have been seen to operate from time to time on politics or upon the church or up , , ! 1 the army . Other jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become a producer or in ? ventor , consumption ceases to be her supreme concern . Spending becomes simplified because its elaboration is too great a drain on her energy and attention , Moreover . spending no longer appears to her as a kind of maker of values , the curious pseudo-production it appears to the " born shopper . " Her sense of achievement through pro ? prietorship is lessened . Nor does a woman interested in her work prize the kind of prestige elaborate consumption brings her . She does not care to make that particular ap ? peal to women nor does she like the relationship to men // it involves . She is likely to want something more in a man than a backer or a retainer . She wants a companion . She soon finds that there are no " interesting " men in " Society , " as we say , or that if they are met there from time to time for fortuitous reasons the " society " back ? ground is not favorable to acquaintance . If she has once belonged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it . Somewhat like an irresponsible man she drifts in and out of it , naturally from a caste point of view a demoralizing factor . Demoralizing , disintegrating or not , at least to the organization of the society life she contributes nothing . Her talents are lost to it . Above a certain economic class level every thoroughly converted feminist is to the extent of her vitality a loss in vitality to the gynocratic caste . If the feminist bent is taken in youth the circumstance may not only deprive the gynocratic caste of a potential leader , it tends to depress its value as a marriage market . Not only is the girl not prepared at a finishing school to take her proper place in society , in another type of school or in college she begins to acquire the seeds of revolution against the gynocracy in so far as it is a gerontocracy , a control by the elders , and particularly a control of her through her sex or her sex relations . She begins to make up her mind to mate to please herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways this decision is disintegrat ? ing to the rule of the elders is its effect upon the desire of the young to go into society . It means that girls will not feel so " crazy about society " because there only can they meet men ? such as they are . Youthful feminists like older feminists want to meet all kinds of men , not only the men admitted into society by their mothers , but the men who never think of applying for admittance . These men girls will meet in their work and in their social intercourse at large . As for those young men who go into society but who go only from time to time and reluctantly at that , they will go still more sporadically when the bait that attracts them , the girls they can not meet anywhere else , is withdrawn . And so the circle revolves . The fewer the young men in society , the less attracted are the girls , even the old-fashioned girls . The more aberrant the girls , the more unwilling the men to " go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Society " as a place for making marriages will be quite neglected , the last vestige of mar ? riage by service , so to speak , subservience to the fashionable dowager having disappeared . This escape from " Society 's " match-making machinery is , I need hardly say , part of that general escape of the young from the old which is the most important , if but little noticed , social fact of our times . The gynocratic caste suffers in its human composition from the revolution of youth and from the social develop ? ment in general of women . It suffers in its institutional framework from another development peculiar to modern culture . I refer to the modern change of attitude towards what we may call life 's crises . In early societies changes in life are met with ceremonials ? with maternity , birth , adolescence , mating and death rites . In modern life this crisis ceremonialism is passing , much of it has passed . Upon it the gynocratic caste has depended for part of its significance , i.e. , it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Coming-out parties are " society events , " weddings are described as " fashionable , " funerals as " representative . " During the last few years , how ? ever , debutante entertainments have been considered rather ridiculous affairs , and fashionable weddings , a little vulgar . Funeral rings and scarfs and gloves are no longer presented to the mourners , mourners are even asked not to send flowers . It will not be long before a wedding breakfast will be as bourgeois as throwing rice in a railway station or as a funeral feast , and standing up all afternoon with a " bud " as antiquated as sitting up all night with a corpse . In other words the occasions upon which the gynocratic caste can make both a public justification of its existence and attract attention to itself , these occasions are dimin ? ishing . Within the caste itself too there is rebellion now and again or pseudo rebellion against self-manifestations . " Functions " are derided by the fashionable . To be seen at a " tea " is an affichement that you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to women 's lunch parties , the most characteristic form of entertainment American " Society " has produced , has come to mean in certain circles that you are not asked to dinner parties . A really smart woman not only never leaves dinner cards , only as an act of condescension does she go to a " real dinner party . " As for seeing her name in the society columns of a news ? paper or her picture in the Sunday supplement she greatly resents such newspaper impertinence . It is a blow to her social prestige , she feels , to be made so common . A social leader can not afford to be inspected at the option of others . This attitude of safeguarding prestige through safeguarding privacy , through objecting to newspaper notoriety , may be expected to spread . Like other fashion ? able attitudes it will be imitated . Then the wretched society reporter will not only feel himself more of a detective than ever , but more of a fakir . His accounts of the outermost circles of society , of its fringes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be less and less heeded and more and more curtailed until one day the society column will find itself among the historic curiosities of journalism . Without boundaries , without leaders , without matri ? monial baits , without means of accrediting or advertising itself through crisis ceremonials or through newspaper notoriety what hope of a future existence is there , we may well ask , for the gynocratic caste ? But surely along one line at least there lies hope or vitality for the society life , the conservative may urge . However undemocratic and anti-feminist it may be , how ? ever unworthily it gratifies the will to power of idle women and irretrievable snobs , however neglectful it is of other primary desires , does it not meet after all one of the most urgent of human impulses , the gregarious impulse , the de ? sire for company ? The society life does satisfy the desire for mere company ? among women . Perhaps men have less of this desire , perhaps they care more for the compan ? ionship which is more than mere company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfies only in a timid , half-hearted way . A degree of segregation , as we have noted , the privacy of exclusiveness , is so neces ? sary to a prestigeful position . Besides as women acquire other forms of human association , association with fellow workers , with professional colleagues , with bona fide play ? mates , the various forms of association men have , women too will be bored , much as men are , by those Jess personal ways of being together characteristic of the society life . Small sets of men and women with common interests and sympathies will form spontaneously to work and play to ? gether ? a grouping that occurs already in Europe and ap ? pears to be on the eve of occurring in New York . There it may be said to await only the disposal of what for lack of a less flippant term we must call the tagger-on spouse problem , a problem that humorously enough even the gynocratic caste can not keep from trying to solve al ? though solution will contribute so importantly to its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimate groups of fellow-workers and playmates , salt of life as they are to many , is there no need of other forms of social intercourse , of more general meeting places , of opportunities for the chance encounter ? Certainly there is , and here at length is a definite and concrete opportunity for the constructive humanist . All kinds of general meeting places are in order ? for all kinds of persons ? city and country club ? houses , gardens , parks , beaches , boat-houses , skating-rinks , outdoor and indoor dancing floors , lobbies in concert-hall and playhouse ? in short the very meeting places that are springing up everywhere under our eyes . These places are increasing rapidly . They will increase more rapidly and they will gain distinction once the need of them begins to appeal to the imagination of the social artist , of the lover of pleasant backgrounds and quiet outlooks . Even to-day places of assembly are becoming more decent and more beautiful in form , although they are dominated as yet both by commercialism and by the old spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a new fearlessness and a new freedom will pervade them in time , however , and then they will properly fulfil their social functions alike for the ad ? venturous individual who seeks in them a setting for the chance encounter , and for the gregarious lover of his kind to whom the sense of the herd is comforting . Et.sti : CLEWS PARSONS . CORRESPONDENCE Fox on a Secure Peace S IR : The scorn with which the more chauvinistic of British journalists and politicians are flouting the German proposal to discuss peace lends new point and in ? terest to one of the best chapters in the recent volume called " Towards a Lasting Settlement . " In the chapter referred to , Miss Irene Cooper Willis draws a telling parallel between the present conflict and the great French war , when England was allied with Prussia in the de fense of European civilization against France ( as a half century or so Later she was allied with Turkey in the de fense of European civilization against Russia ) . " We are in a war of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine that we are at war . . , This new system . . . in France can not be rendered safe by any art . . . it must be destroyed or it will destroy all Europe . " So wrote Burke in 1796 ; and so , with the change of a single word , writes and speaks official Britain to-day . In vain Fox urged , as many sane Englishmen are to-day urging , that " a war to exterminate principles will mean a war to all eternity . . . . Impotent are the men who think opinions can be so encountered . " French offers of peace in the early stages of conflict were uniformly rejected as not providing , in Mr. Bonar Law 's phrase , " indemnity for the past and security for the fu ? ture . " But as the years of bloody and indecisive struggle went on the popular longing for peace became too manifest to be any longer officially ignored . Then it was that Burke , fanning the ashes of his once-splendid intellect to a last fiery flame of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a Regicide Peace " in t796 . " What , you wouldtreat with regicides and assassins ! " he cried . " Assuredly we should treat with them , " replied Fox . " If we treat with France only when she has a government of which we approve , good God ! we shall fight eternally . " " The ques ? tion was not what degree of abhorrence ought to be felt of French cruelty , but what line of conduct ought to be pursued consistent with British policy , which had hitherto accepted the theory that every independent nation had a right to regulate its own government . " Was it to be henceforth a British maxim that you should " make peace with no man of whose good conduct you are not satisfied , but make an alliance with any man no matter how profli ? gate or faithless he may be " ? " Hatred of vice is no just cause of war between nations . If it were , good God ! with which of those Powers with whom we are now com ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we never to have peace because that peace may be insecure ? A state of peace immediately after a war of such violence must in some respect be a state of insecurity . We must be satis ? fied with the best security we can get : it will , at any rate , be not less secure than a state of war . To go on fighting as a speculation , that perchance we may gain a better peace some time hence ? what can this do but add to the sum of human horrors ? " These words of one of the greatest of English statesmen are as pertinent to-day as when they were first spoken , one hundred and twenty years ago . WALDO R. BROWNE . Wyoming , New York . Defending Divorce Lawyers IR : I have read with interest the article in your issue of December 2nd , entitled " The Middleman in Divorce , " and I agree with the authors of the article that the case of Anton and his wife , in common with other cases of the same character , represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the profession nor in accord with the facts to let the inference be so readily drawn from the article referred to , that lawyers are the chief or one of the chief causes of the divorce evil . Thirty per cent of the divorce cases filed in Cleveland in the last three years were dismissed , usually by the voluntary act of the parties . From this statement one would conclude that the lawyers of Cleveland were not only not obstruct ? ing reconciliations , but were very busy indeed effecting them . The conclusion is just as logical that the recon ? ciliations were effected by the lawyers in spite of the ef ? forts of the clients to " get " divorces , as the contrary con ? clusion expressed in the article . We all agree that divorces are all too frequent and all too easy to obtain , but experience will teach that while the wise lawyer does endeavor to bring about an adjust ? ment of differences before filing suit his success is bound to be quite limited . He can often effect a settlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he can be ? fore . The divorce question is one which has its roots deeper down in our social system than the courts . If we want to curb divorces and all the undesirable consequences we must look deeper than the litigation affecting them . I do not mean that the methods of handling these cases through the courts need no change ? on the contrary changes are needed ? but any change will not affect ma ? terially the causes or frequency of divorce complaints .
