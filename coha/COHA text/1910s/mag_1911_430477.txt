 | IN writing a chapter on religion and caste in India as I have seen it , I wish to begin by proclaiming how superficial this sketch must be , and how well I know what I do not know of a subject to which many volumes have been devoted by students of many years ' residence in India , and for a full analysis and history of which many volumes are still needed . I am proposing merely to furnish enough material to put the situation before my countrymen and to show how ludicrous is the ideal of self-government , as we understand it , for a people so unhomogeneous , and how calamitous will be the result of going too fast in granting legislative privileges . First of all caste is a question of birth , and there is no entry except by birth . A worker in a coal-mine may become a part owner thereof , and his daughter marry a peer , and his grandson - become a peer in England . I can personally introduce the reader to dozens of still uneducated clerks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widows , sisters , and daughters , whose millions seat them at the dinner tables of the Brahman class in America . But no millions will enable the low-caste Hindu to marry into a Brahman family , or even to touch the hand , or throw his shadow on the food , of a Brahman in India . If a man is excommunicated by his caste fellows in India , no one of the caste will eat with him , accept water from his hands , or marry him . His own wife will not touch him or speak with him . He is dead to his family . The barber even will not shave him , or cut his hair , or his toe-nails . There is no legislation , no police work , no trial in the courts , no adjustment of land revenue or land tenure , no meeting of municipal or district councils , no appointment to office small or great , no handling of any community in time of plague or famine , no hygienic precautions or sanitary arrangements , into which does not enter this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perhaps to foil , the most reasonable and necessary work of the administrator . A Brahman clerk has been known to distribute legal documents by throwing them down at the end of the village street in which live his low-caste brethren . Lettercarriers have been known to refuse to enter the houses of , or to permit themselves to come into personal contact with , those of a lower status than themselves . If one could picture to oneself social snobbery lifted into a fanatical religious faith , it would be a pale description of the iron subdivisions of caste in India , but even then simple , as compared with the meticulous intricacies of this social pall . There is no patriotism , and can be none , in a country thus divided against itself , and di-  | vided against itself not only geographically but socially . As I watch for hours at a time the worshippers at the Ghats , on the banks of the Ganges at Benares , I only find myself more puzzled . It is more than complicated , it is cloudy confusion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental and physical working powers . Benares has been the capital of the Hindu religion for more years than any historian has counted . Buddha , who was born about 557 and who died about 478 B. C. , began his public teaching in the deer-forest near what was even then the great city of Benares . For nearly two thousand five hundred years , of which we have some knowledge , and for how many years more no man knows , the Hindus have bathed and prayed here on the banks of the Ganges . Buddhism and Islamism have been absorbed or swept aside . It must be said of Buddhism , however , that it has left one indelible mark all over India , China , and the East , and that is the teaching of gentleness and kindness to one another and to animals . Buddha taught that life is but a prolonged endeavor to escape from suffering , and that , therefore , to cause others to suffer is the unforgivable sin . By meditation a man is to lose the sense of the painfulness of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he must pass before reaching Nirvana , where all re-birth ends at last , and one loses consciousness forever . This creed is pure agnosticism , holding that a man 's own acts alone make up the tale of his faith . Agnosticism everywhere throws a man back upon himself , and everywhere and always produces one of two results . It makes men , as in India and China , pessimists ? hopeless , helpless , and without ambitions for either their souls or their bodies ; or it makes men colossal egoists who worship themselves . Nothing can be more portentous of evil to the race than our agnostic democracies of the West , which are putting man on a pedestal , and waving the incense of eight hours ' work , old-age pensions , no conscription , a vote for each adult , state support , and so on , before him . It was a moving spectacle , for example , to all students of the ethnic religions when Mr. Keir Hardie , as the exponent of Western agnosticism , or man as his own god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Buddhist-impregnated Indians , steeped in pessimism . They immediately dubbed him the " King of the Coolies " and could not wrench their imaginations to see how a man of no caste could be worth imitating or following . The first flash of a picture that will some day be a terrible conflict between the Yellow and the White was revealed when the man who cared everything for man met the men who care nothing for man , and neither understood the other in the least . Buddhism has done for the East what rationalism has done for the West ; it makes men doubt the existence , even deny the existence , of any power higher than themselves , but with the abysmal difference that it prostrates man in the East while it puts him on a dangerous pinnacle in the West . Man with nothing higher than himself to obey , to fear , to love , or to placate , becomes morally and mentally disorderly . The same is true of the state , which brings itself to the condition where the voting man is paramount , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With no higher ideal than that , a state disintegrates , drifts into bureaucracy , then into pensionism , finally into the bread-and-circus stage , and then disappears . Such a failure was Athens , such a failure is before our eyes in modern France , France the land of pose and phrase , egotism and scepticism . Even the ethical code of agnosticism fades and dies , lacking a higher sanction to command obedience . Buddha little thought that his teaching of the valuelessness of life would result in the callous cruelty of the Indian and the Chinese . Rousseau , if he thought about it at all , could hardly have dreamed that his scheme of a return to the simple and the natural life , with every man equal , would make of France a shambles , and produce a philosophy of life which , while attempting to gain the whole world for each individual , not only loses its soul , but loses the whole world , for every body of individuals which attempts it . The time is still peons off when each man may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the East . It will prove a colossal failure in the West . Curiously enough , it was King Asoka , nicknamed " The Furious " in his youth , who , in 260 B. C. , became the great apostle and missionary of Buddhism . The lives @#  | he had taken , the suffering he had caused , in the days of his autocratic sway , led him to find comfort and repentance in a creed which abhorred the taking of life . It was through his influence , and the influence of his saffron-robed priests , of whom he is said to have supported forty thousand at his own expense , that Buddhism grew from a mere sect of enthusiasts into the creed of a third of the human race , and spread through Asia and parts of Africa and Europe . The Brahmanism of Benares is partly the result of this wave of Buddhism . It is a gentle , mannerly , softspoken crowd , absorbed in forgetting that it lives . This carelessness of life , on the other hand , breaks out in monstrous slaughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it loses control of itself . The Mutiny was a picture of pessimism let loose ; the French Revolution was a picture of how rationalism establishes the rights of man , or in the happy phrase of that most skilful and most brilliant modern political diagnostician , Lord Rosebery , " the fierce equality of France . " Benares at the present time , so far as buildings are concerned , is of the most modern . The idol-breaking Muhammadans left nothing after their conquering of the city except a spiteful mosque , built by the fanatical Aurangzeb on one of the sacred sites , which still rears its towers above all the other buildings on the river bank ; and there are few buildings of a later date than the middle of the eighteenth century . But the Ganges has never been conquered , nor turned aside , nor has the Hindu faith . They are here by the thousands this morning , washing themselves , washing their clothes , sitting wrapt in contemplation , some of them , only their lips moving . Old and young , men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their arrangement of clothing must be peculiar , for they dress , and undress , and bathe , and somehow each one so manages his or her clothing that there is not a hint of indecency or even of immodesty . You are rowed along within a few feet of the bank of the river where these thousands are bathing , drying themselves , dressing and undressing , and nothing could be more sedately proper . You see the Brahman rubbing his sacred triple thread round and round his shoulder and body , others scrubbing their mouths violently with their fingers , others washing their clothes , babies being dipped by father or mother , and soundly rubbed afterward , youths more particular , using combs , and higher up on the bank the barbers are busy , shaving and cutting hair , while the customer sits cross-legged , holding a mirror . Even my travelled Brahman friend , who told me that he was what we would call a Unitarian , wore , and showed me , his sacred thread . The Rajput father binds round the arm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to ward off evil spirits . No doubt the sacred cord of the twice-born castes of India originated in a similar be-  | lief . The cord is made in various ways . " Among the Madras Brahmans , who are most careful in such matters , it is of fine country-grown cotton , not foreign , and spun by hand . Three very fine threads are twisted by a Brahman into a single cord sixteen feet long . He then squats on the ground , winds it thrice around his knees , and fastens the ends in a special knot known as that of Brahma . " In the north , the four fingers of the hand are closed , and a thread is wound back and forth over them ninety-six times . This thread forms one strand of the cord , and three of them make it complete . During worship of the gods it remains over the left shoulder ; when the wearer is unclean , or when he performs the rites for the dead , he shifts it to the right shoulder . The thread is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he is supposed to assume the religious obligations and the authority and duty of a Brahman . When the thread is first put on the boy he makes pretence of leaving the house to become an ascetic , but he is , of course , persuaded to return and live as a layman . It seemed to me strange that there was no swimming . In any Western crowd there would have been scores of boys and men diving , swimming , playing games in the water ; but there is no sign of any desire for exercise or play here . Rubbing themselves , thrashing their clothes on the flat rocks , moving their lips and hands in prayer , but no other exercise . They are a sitting , riding race , not a walking or running one . Their posture is as peculiar to them as their color . It is always the same , wherever you see them , whether it be the prince in his palace , these people praying by the river bank , the passengers waiting for the train at the railway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your bearer waiting outside your door , or the cab-driver on his box in the great cities . The hinges in their knees must be different from ours . They squat down with their knee-caps under their chins , and that part of their persons which the French describe as oil le dos change de nom close up against their heels . I was told at Udaipur that His Highness , the Maharana of Udaipur , has no chairs in his private apartments , but always sits cross-legged on the floor , whether to eat , or read , or rest . When you return to your cab you will find the driver almost invariably perched up on the seat with his legs under him . Thousands of years of chairlessness have made this the most comfortable posture for them . I suppose in a country of three hundred millions of people there is only room for them to sit on the ground , and , at any rate , among these people there is no money to provide any piece of furniture which is , at one and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaply upholstered , as that part of the person , ou le dos change de nom ! Benares is evidently a cosmopolitan place ; you notice the difference in the people as you drive or walk through the streets . They are less shy , the women do not cover their faces so carefully , they are more accustomed to strangers , and well they may be , since it is estimated that there are a million pilgrims here every year , who come to bathe , to pray , and to take the long , dusty walk , or pilgrimage , of some fortyfive miles , around the sacred precincts of the city . Into the sacred waters of the Ganges , too , every Hindu wishes his ashes thrown . At one of the Ghats on the bank I saw bodies burning , and others lying waiting to be burned . Both here and at Bombay I have been present at these burnings . The bodies are brought in on a frail litter . A pile of logs is built up , held in place by four iron stanchions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the logs , more logs are piled on top , the litter is broken up and added to the small fagots underneath , and the fire is lighted . There are various ceremonies connected with the rite . The body is carried several times around the pile before being placed upon it . The nearest relative walks around the pile with a jar of water , letting it drip down as he goes , till of a sudden he dashes the jar to the ground , breaking it to pieces . A symbol of all life , everywhere . At a certain moment , too , the skull is fractured by the nearest relative , to allow the easy escape of the spirit to another world . Where the deceased is rich , the fire is made of costly and sweet-smelling wood , sandal-wood and the like , and the ceremonies are more elaborate and more prolonged . No doubt it is the ideal way to dispose of a dead body , but when I have seen it done here it seemed to me a callous and a careless rite . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not be a cause of mourning , but parting from those one adores is a poignant sorrow , even if there is to be another meeting here on earth . So far as I have studied the faces of mourners here , I could see nothing . In these matters they are either behind or very far in advance of us . No doubt Mrs. Annie Besant , who has her Hindu college here at Benares , would maintain the latter . But I have noticed all over India the absolute indifference of the natives themselves to the pain , and deformities , and maladies that are displayed as an excuse for alms . It is not the stoicism of our Western Indians , who thought it dishonorable to show fear , or to shrink from pain , but an imbedded indifference , a numbness to this particular influence . We , on the contrary , dislike the sight of these things , and turn from them , and pity is forced from us , but all such spectacles seem to pass absolutely unnoticed by the Oriental . And what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carved , so hideously grotesque are they sometimes . It is a wonder there are not more . A wonder , too , that there is not more plague , more cholera , more disease of every kind . Here on the banks of this river are thousands , bathing , washing their clothes , and drinking , all within a few yards of one another . One man drinks the dregs from another man 's body , another the scourings from another 's clothes , and women and children the same . It is not strange that India is the paradise of contagion . I have heard it maintained that the Ganges , which is the most bathed-in river in the world , is different from other rivers , in that the water itself has certain antiseptic qualities , and that microbes do not flourish in it as in other waters . If one rows up and down the river front , or walks through the narrow streets leading to the river , the stench and mud and crowds make it appear a very incubator of microbes . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of which was a muchfrequented temple . Cows stood about in their own filth , men , women , and children crowded in , went to the shrine where they bowed and prayed , and were given something by the attendant , or priest , which they popped into their mouths . Some came away with garlands , but all of them evidently impervious to the smells and the mud . It was warm outside , but in this particular temple the smell of hot humanity , and hot cow , was sickening . Nor Mecca , nor Jerusalem has known such hordes of worshippers , so many thousands of years of continuous pilgrimage . No matter what his caste , no matter what his occupation , no matter how black his heart or red his hands , the Hindu who dies within a radius of fifty miles of Benares is spared all future torment , so it is said . In the theory of the transmigration of souls , or metempsychosis , the Hindu believes that there are some millions of species of animals that he may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he arrives at the house of his god , if he does not pay due attention to the duties and formalities of his religion . This saving of one 's own soul becomes a very important business under these circumstances . The hell of the most enthusiastic revivalist is a very lukewarm affair when compared with this interminable vista of animal impersonations which confronts the pious Hindu . The upper classes and intelligent Hindus have become Theists , but the mass of the @#  | Hindu world are crass Polytheists , who worship not only endless named gods , but sticks , and stones , and trees , and mounds of earth of their own choosing and making . On one occasion I asked a lowercaste Hindu , who had been very attentive in his service , if I was not taking too much of his time . I had noticed that his forehead was not marked , a sign that he had not bathed and prayed as his ritual requires . " Oh , " he replied , " I have my own private god in my compound ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hindu , of whom I saw a good deal , told me that he was what we would call a " Unitarian ! " Another Brahman , of the mystical type , is said to have remarked quite casually : " I have never seen Christ myself , but I have a friend who often sees him , and he tells my friend that he finds many of his followers very trying people . " I remember that I took a course of study in the Ethnic Religions when at the University , but of these mystic refinements on the one hand , and these crudities on the other , I knew nothing till I was face to face with them here . One is rather shocked at the abysmal gulf between the book and the fact , between the theory and the practice , when one is brought into close contact with the latter in India . As I stand beside the reeking cow , ankle-deep in filth , in the temple of this dark , crowded court in Benares , and see the earnestness of the worshippers , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or may have known , or shall know , are of little use in interpreting this situation which is here and now , and which has been for thousands of years . All religions really , whether of Buddha , Brahma , Muhammad , or Christ , maintain that life is to die . The Buddhist and the Brahman and the Muhammadan stick to the original text , to the primitive message . We Westerners have twisted the Christianity of Christ into a code and a creed suited to our climate , our environment , our temperament , and our ambitions , and we maintain that life is to live . But no philosophy and no religion which has its roots in the East can be fairly interpreted as giving such a message . We have interpreted isolated texts to please our love of life , but the founder of Christianity was an Oriental , with the same profound conviction that " my Father 's many mansions " are preferable to hut or palace here , which characterizes the creeds of the Buddhist , the Brahman , and the Muhammadan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Brahman , the Muhammadan is a Muhammadan but we Westerners are not Christians . We merely wear an ethical cloak , made of a patchwork of sayings , which we have wrenched from their context , to enable us to do our work in the world with freedom of movement . Were we to wrap ourselves in the genuine robes of Christianity we should be as hampered , and as helpless , as are the thorough-going disciples of Buddha , Brahma , or Muhammad . Hinduism is not only a religious bond , but it is also a sort of social league governing all the relations of life . As a social league it rests upon caste , that immovable barrier against reform or progress ; as a religious bond , it rests upon a union of the Aryan and the Buddhistic faith . Hinduism recognized the so-called twice-born , or Aryan castes , viz. , the Brahmans or priests , the Kshattriyas or warriors , the Vaisyas or @# agriculturalists , and the Sudras or serfs . But this is a mere guide-book classification . If you investigate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishermen , weavers , artisans , barbers , coolies , some Muhammadans , some Brahmans , traders , money-lenders , and here and there Mahrattas , and a few other immigrants . But even these divisions do not begin to complete the list , for there are still subdivisions of these . Even the Brahmans have ten distinct classes or nations , and these again are divided into some two thousand tribes . In Bombay alone , where there are more than a million Brahmans , there are some two hundred groups of them , none of which intermarries with another . In Madras there are six groups each speaking a different tongue , and no member of one group will marry or eat with the member of another ; while each of these groups , again , has rules regarding the persons within its @#  | own circle , with whom its members may marry or eat cooked food . The Brahmans of the south of India claim to be of higher rank than the Brahmans of the north , holding that the Brahmanism of the north has been defiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south have remained more or less untouched by foreign influences . Unlike the northern Brahman , there is no lower caste from whom the southern Brahman will take water . In this matter of religion , as in political and social matters , the women of India are bigotedly conservative , and insistent upon maintaining all the traditional observances . The most outspoken and the fiercest rebels against the English power whom I met in India were women . The two I remember best were , one the wife of a prominent Maharaja , and the other the sister of a distinguished Muhammadan . They were ready to take any measures to rid India of British rule . So , too , the Kshattriyas , or Rajputs , are divided into some six hundred tribes in different parts of India . The authorities say that it is impossible to number all the castes in India . They number thousands at least . When it is remembered that the members of these different castes can not intermarry , can not eat together , and that as a rule no Hindu of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caste , and that much the same rule obtains in regard to the drinking of water , one begins to understand , dimly , the difficulties inherent in any dealings with these people ; whether for hygienic , social , or military purposes . Verily , their ways are not as our ways . Even at the railway stations in some parts of India you see notices posted : " Water for Hindus . " " Water for Muhammadans . " Just , as one example , imagine the difficulty of helpfulness to one another when  | the neglected and the help-needing person may be one whom to touch , or to come in contact with in any way , is a social and religious degradation , imperilling not only one 's social position , but one 's salvation . The enlightened ruler of Baroda , His Highness , the Gaekwar , calls these people the " Untouchables , " a very happy description of them , and he estimates their numbers at six million , or a fifth of the population . He , a Hindu of the Maratha branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into innumerable castes , claiming to rise by minutely graduated steps from the Pariah to the Brahman , is a whole tissue of injustice , splitting men equal by nature into divisions high and low , based not on the natural standard of personal qualities , but on the accident of birth . The eternal struggle between caste and caste for social superiority has become a source of constant ill-feeling in these days . The human desire to help the members of one 's caste also leads to nepotism , heart-burnings , and consequent mutual distrust . " The polluting power of a cat , as an example of the intricacies of this subject of caste , is small , of a dog greater , but nothing equals the pollution of a Pariah . Man , in this connection , is degraded below the beasts . Such people are denied the advantages of social sympathy and industrial aid . They are denied all influence for good , arising out of free intercourse with their neighbors . The full and free use of hospitals , of public inns , public conveyances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are even refused the opportunities of earning a living . Menial service even is denied them , as they can not touch the food or enter the houses of the higher castes . My friend , the Maharaja Gaekwar of Baroda , is possibly the most outspoken prince in India , so I quote another saying of his , that my readers may know something of his political and social views : " I can quite understand the difficulty involved in giving up one 's inherited ideals of thought and custom , especially in conservative India . If the Indian people wish to progress , and to make the most of their national influence , they must consciously give up these old false ideals and open their eyes to the light of progress , in which not one class , or many classes , but all shall share . Men are asking for a constitution , by which they may limit the powers of princes and governments ; they neglect to limit the tyrannical and despotic sway of religion , which is crushing the life out of our people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all individuality and ambition . There is no room in the world of to-day for such priests as are little gods with an exaggerated idea of their own importance , insisting upon their infallibility , content with ignorance , contemptuous of knowledge , Priests of this kind are a drag on the wheels of progress . Instead of ministering to the people they are their bad angels . " Sir Harry Johnston , who at least can not be accused of not knowing India , writes : " The one hundred and sixty-two million Hindu men and women and children follow for the most part wholly unreasonable forms of religion , quite incompatible with modern ideas of physical development , social progress , sanitation , avoidance of cruelty , and unrestricted intercourse with one 's fellow-men . " To this he adds : " If all forms of the Hindu religion ? Brahmanism ? could be submitted to an impartial world-congress of non-Hindus , the members of which were selected from all parts of non-Hindu Apia , from America , Europe , and Africa , the Hindu religion would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbish , fulfilling no useful end whatever , only adding to the general burden borne by humanity in its struggle for existence . And , of course , so long as two hundred million Indians remain attached to these preposterous faiths , with their absurd and useless ceremonials , and food taboos , so long ? if for that reason alone ? will the British be justified in ruling the Indian Empire with some degree of absolutism . " In this connection , one should remember that of the fifty-five million adult male Muhammadans , about seventy-five per cent can read and write in Hindustani , and some ten per cent are acquainted with English ; while of the one hundred and sixty-two million Hindus only twenty per cent of the adult males can read and write in the vernacular , and only three per cent are acquainted with English . It is somewhat disconcerting to an observer and student of Indian affairs , therefore , to find that it is from the Hindu  | element and from the Brahman caste that the murderers , bomb-throwers , seditious editors of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English officials on platforms and in theatres are drawn . It can only mean that the great Brahman caste , which for centuries have been the social and political leaders of these timid and ignorant masses , are jealous of the English authority . Instead of aiding in all efforts to improve the sanitation , in all efforts to protect the peasant from the money-lender , in all schemes for irrigation and education , the Brahman is the leader of the reactionist party . He prefers , apparently , that the mass of the people should remain ignorant , debased , diseased , and helpless , as his position is magnified by just the width of the social chasm between himself and them . He both hates the English and despises his own people . He and his people have been the victims of the Turk , the Tartar , the Mongol , who , times without number , have swept through the Afghan passes , and robbed , slaughtered , and deflowered , but he has always heretofore reappeared as the religious , social , and political lord of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see his acknowledged superiority slip away from him , through the uplifting of the masses ? slow though the process be ? by the English rulers . There are numbers of sympathizers with the so-called Indian patriots in America , who contribute to their funds and to their excitement . They should realize that it is the Brahman agitator they are backing , and they should take some pains to assure themselves that they are not putting their money on the wrong horse . It is well enough to sympa- thize with ? I will go farther and say ? and to help any body of men suffering from the tyranny of injustice and brutality , whether at home or abroad . Though we have such down-trodden people here at home needing our attention , it is perhaps excusable in certain temperaments to prefer the excitement of participation in revolutions abroad , where at any rate our own skins may remain whole , whatever happens . But this attempt of the Brahman agitators to oust the British , or at all events to gain more offices , more authority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British control by the rule of the Brahman which represents the most tyrannical , the most un-American , and the most revolting social , religious , and political autocracy the world has ever seen . How any American , whatever his ideals or his sympathies , can lend his influence in support of a movement to increase the power of the Brahman caste in India , politically or otherwise , can only be explained on two grounds : he is either maliciously mischievous , or he is ignorant . If one were to search the world to find ideals utterly unlike , and destructive of American ideals of government , of religious liberty , and of social freedom , he could find them nowhere better than in Brahmanism . He has never been a fighting-man ; he has fattened upon superstition , and consequently has , and does encourage it to the utmost , and holds , consequently , the strange position in India of being a seditionist as against the English and a reactionary as against his own people . There is a harsher word than I care to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , he is distinctly a stumbling-block in the present situation . Men who ask for larger representation in the government , knowing full well that they alone are sufficiently educated to profit by it , and who are inciting the weak-minded to assassinate , and the ignorant to balk , the alien reformers , are difficult to deal with , especially when one hears on every side from disinterested natives that they tremble at the idea of their future magistrates , having as much concern with their caste elevation as with the in-@# @#  | crease of their salary , and who say : " It would be treason to humanity to place us by force of British bayonets under the yoke of those whose flesh creeps on their hones when they hear of a war . " I quote from a Rajput noble of Oudh . We have only to picture to ourselves the Presbyterians , the Methodists , the Catholics , the Episcopalians , and the railway employees , the shop-keepers , the clerks , the barbers , the butchers , the money-lenders , and the lowest class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided into sects and subjects , not permitted to intermarry , to eat together , or to touch food cooked one for the other , to get an idea of the helpless chaos so far as any effective work or progress as a community are concerned . And this is by no means an exaggerated picture of thousands of communities all over India . On the contrary , it is but a very rough sketch of communities far more meticulously subdivided and far more intricately disassociated . This system of caste , which , by the way , is the great stumbling-block in the way of native reformers , whether revolutionary or otherwise , is not limited to social and religious matters , but permeates even the industries of the people , since each caste is also , in a way , a sort of trade-guild . It makes laws and rules for the different trades , and even goes so far as to promote and support strikes . This is but a passing and superficial statement of a most intricate , and to the Western mind most incomprehensible , social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indication of erudition , nor as an attempt to explain , or to make clear , what years of study and experience would hardly compass , but to give an example of one of the most difficult problems facing the English administrators of this huge continent . It is easy to see that the visible ruler is soon , and surely , held responsible for everything that goes wrong . The English government has introduced authority which insists upon standing absolutely aloof ? as it must ? from all interference in religious matters . But here , as we have seen , the religious life begins with the brushing of the teeth in the morning , and thoroughly permeates the hourly life of the people , their eating , drinking , marrying , and dying . There are new and strange desires , there are distress and discontent among the peasants , there is a rearrangement of classes , there is the ignoring of caste , as in the railway trains , where all must of necessity be treated alike . Fancy the New York Central Railway attempting to cater to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian Scientists , New York hoodlums and Brahmans from Boston , and when I say that such a problem is comparatively easy as compared to this problem of caste in India , I tell even less than the bare truth . The government is , of course , blamed for this by the ignorant . The sages and teachers of the Hindus have been preaching for centuries asceticism as an escape from the distresses and wearisome problems of life . Now comes a spirit of progress , rejoicing in and lauding material possessions , comfort , and the prolongation of life . Life is to be a struggle to overcome the impediments , whether physical or climatic , to an agreeable existence even in India . Men are pushed forward to live , and to live as comfortably as possible , who heretofore have been taught that the heights of human perfection are reached only by those who live most simply , who ignore most completely the material side of life , and who quit most speedily this tenement for another . The Brahman looked forward to absorption in Brahma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as the material world is concerned . There was a thick-headed citizen of Marseilles who was known to have little enthusiasm for the church , but who was none the less a frequent attendant at mass . When asked why he attended mass he replied : " Oh , j'attends que ca soit fini ! " There are millions in India who have that hopeless , helpless air . Their whole physical and mental attitude seems to say : " Oh , nous attendons que ca soit fini ! " Into this state of mind , into this situation , the Englishman introduces the wedge of Western civilization . Railways , telegraph wires canals , hospitals , dispensaries , police , justice without bribery , and the cheery Englishman himself , playing , shooting , making himself comfortable , doing his duty , and hoping and believing in , not only to-morrow , but the day after to-morrow .

England comes blandly ignoring these gods , smilingly sure that life is worth living , and ready to spend an immense amount of energy in giving life , what every Englishman all over the world believes to be the only proper setting for such a jewel ? comfort ! England comes offering prizes to those who win material prosperity , and these people have not merely been taught , but have had it ground into them for centuries , that material possessions are merely the hampering baggage of spirits , which should be always on the alert to escape to another place . India , for all these centuries , has had no standards but those of birth , blood , caste , and the personal power of conquest . Poverty was no disgrace ; on the contrary , the religious beggar , the Brahman , the Buddhist priest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to , and reverenced , because he had stripped himself of every form of wealth . Now India is being inoculated with the economic lymph of the West . They see men treated with respect , and placed in dignified positions , partly at least because they are rich . It is hard , for an American particularly , to understand what a tremendous change this marks for India . What a man accumulates and holds counts . This is new to India . This situation adds measurably to the existing discontent of an ever-increasing number , who measuring themselves by this entirely new standard find inequalities they equally dislike , and do not understand . They are beginning to wonder if one may not at the same time be holy and rich . It is easier to be poor and good than to be rich and vulgar ? they see evidences of this , but many , none the less , are being influenced to prefer the latter . Their own miseries were not enough . They have now this new source of discontent , the poison of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even political tyranny of the irresponsible rich is yet to be their portion , and their potion , and it will prove more unpalatable to them than any that has yet been forced upon them . They must go through all this , and then , alas ! learn all over again that comfort is not prosperity , that luxury , is not culture , and that a mind besmeared with odds and ends of learning is not education . Even England and America are only just beginning to see this .  | So far as the masses of India are concerned , they still preserve and adhere to their centuries-old polytheism , they worship innumerable gods ; the class slightly above them still worship the gods of the Hindu Pantheon as manifestations of divinity which is everywhere ? in short , they are Pantheists ; while the students , and teachers , and intellectuals of the higher castes are weaving and unravelling the fine theological threads , which were doing duty for the scholars ' exercises of the fourth century and the schoolmen of the Middle Ages . Mr. K. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is mainly and substantially idolatrous ; and image-worship , in which anthropomorphism plays an important part , is its principal feature . It has many cults , many sects , each having its special gods and goddesses , but all combine to venerate the entire Hindu pantheon . The worship of a certain deity representing the active female principle of the universe is never complete without the shedding of blood , and she has even to plead guilty to a hankering for human sacrifice . " There is more than one example , even of late years , where this goddess has been offered human sarifices by her ignorant worshippers . If there were no problems of taxation , of hygiene and sanitation , of education , of administration , of safeguarding the country within , and from without , against sedition and attack , this disease of the religious and social skin , within which these people move and have their prejudices , were surely a task of momentous difficulty in and of itself . Fortunately for the problem , and probably for themselves , this hard-playing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in themselves , take all these matters so lightly , ignore them so placidly , discuss them so flippantly , that for them they cease to exist . They come and stare at Benares like children at a pantomime , then return to deal justly and patiently with their three hundred million wards , as though the whole spiritual and intellectual life of thousands of years and millions of subjects did not exist . This ignorance and confidence explain their success , but these ignored problems are none the less the fundamental cause of most of their anxieties . These people are so split up into factions , racial , religious , social , and political , that they can not corn- II 9 bine to free themselves from their governors . Herein lies the safety of the English . But 1857 , the year of the Mutiny , showed that if once the religious prejudices could be touched , then the fire will light and burn . Once the Muhammadans were persuaded that the abhorred pig , and the Hindus that the sacred cow , were used to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beating their supposedly unbeatable conquerors in the Crimea , they threw off all allegiance , they forsook friends , they killed companions and broke the bonds of years , to an extent that their own officers , who had lived in the closest intercourse with them , could not believe possible . The seditionist of to-day knows full well the strings to pull to produce another uprising . Not many months ago it was going the rounds that the bone-dust of animals was to be mixed with the sugar , and the Japanese success over white opponents has been used to the full to enflame their warlike ambitions . It is only some such attack upon their religious and racial sensibilities and prejudices that can pervade the mass of the people , and the Indian anarchist knows it and is nowadays again on the lookout for some such materials to start the blaze . It is to be remembered , too , as an important factor in any discussion of caste , that peace has been maintained in the past , in these thousands of communities all over India , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influenced by the men entitled to influence it . When caste is destroyed into whose hands will this governing power in all these small communities fall ? The English thus far have left , to a large extent , these smaller offices in the hands of those who have always asserted their right to them by reason of their blood or caste standing , a right , be it said , universally and contentedly recognized . There is no new influence , no new arrangement to supplant this old system , and the old system of caste is being , even though very slowly , corroded and eaten away by the civilization of the West . When it disappears the governors of India will have another difficult problem to face . They will have reached the summit of one mountain of reform only to see another peak beyond . Caste may interfere with progress , but it undoubtedly helps  | mightily to preserve the peace . Caste is a better policeman even than the Englishman . Once this system , which has for thousands of years and still does permeate all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of existence , all sorts of other superstitions will follow to create trouble . There were actual riots in the streets of the capital of Korea , some years ago , due to a wide-spread report that the American missionaries were boiling Korean babies to manufacture chemicals for photographic processes . This was , indeed , a tribute to Yankee ingenuity , but it is also an illustration of what preposterous methods may be used successfully to breed trouble among masses of ignorant people . It is an interesting commentary upon the impartial attitude of the English , that while they pay and protect missionaries in India and elsewhere , they are at the same time large manufacturers and shippers of idols to these same countries . The ordained missionaries in India number something over a thousand , with about the same number of native pastors . They have made practically no impression upon India , and the best of them , both European and native , admit as much themselves . The converts are almost entirely from the lowest class of natives , and from the Eurasians , i.e. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the way , for whom one has much sympathy , as they are equally despised and rejected by the English and the Indians . " In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred ( always excepting the Roman Catholic Christians of the West Coast ) to be a Christian is to have been a pariah " writes Stanley Rice , a recognized authority on the subject . Medical assistance , teaching , and so on by the missionaries are valuable , but I doubt whether either the civilian or the soldier would not willingly see the whole band of missionaries sent home . Their interest in the native sometimes gets to the point of mawkishness , leading the native to overestimate his own importance , and weakening his respect for authority . Upon the better-class Indian mind , the necessary assumption of omniscience which must underlie all foreign missionary effort , particularly when many of the missionaries are distinctly of the social and intellectual mediocrity , produces an invulnerable dislike . To them the theological crazy-quilt , offered them as a coverlet for their salvation , a patchwork of Anglican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Universalist , must lack dignity , subtlety , and beauty of outline . The Sanskrit word for caste is color . A philologist might argue that this matter of caste probably dated from the time when the swarms of white Aryans came to India , and wished to cut themselves off and to keep themselves apart from the darker races they found there . The missionary finds himself balked in his endeavors by his own logic . If the incarnation is true , then no race which is Christian can remain ostracized from and by other Christian races . The European Christians in India are a caste by themselves . They will not hear of much social intercourse , or of intermarriage . Indian Christians are even barred from the Transvaal by their brother Christians there . White Christians refuse to meet African Christians even at the sacrament ; much more strongly do they persist in ostracizing them socially . Whatever the Indian may be physically and morally , he is admittedly subtle mentally . To preach brotherly love at the table of the holy communion , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intercourse , or marriage , with your sisters or daughters , is a difficult dilemma , a hornless dilemma , in fact , for the missionary . For the convert , belief in the incarnation is indispensable , but for the white converter to carry out the plain prescriptions of the incarnation is a crime against his race . It is safe to say that there will be no great missionary progress among the colored races until this problem is solved . It is not surprising that the rooted beliefs of the East are sometimes puzzled into ferocity . And , alas ! I am bound to admit , as an outsider , that I am not sure that one does not see Buddha , Confucius , or Muhammad in the streets of Rangoon , Peking , and Peshawar , quite as often as one sees Jesus of Nazareth in the streets of London , Paris , or New York . A dozen unmarried women , singing and beating tambourines , accompanied and led by one man , must necessarily daunt the credulity of the Muhammadan or the Chinese Buddhist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home or abroad , are those few people , men and  | women , who never preach , never pray in public , and never by any chance argue , but who make us humble and ashamed by being better than we are . They convert us by their unvoiced consistency of conduct . They are unsalaried , unconscious , but none the less the saviors of the world . There are , and always have been , a few lay Englishmen of that stamp in India , and I have seen some of their converts , and they are the only converted ones in all India for whose faith or courage I would give a fig , when put to the test of the shadow of the cross , or the edge of a sword . Praying to a congregation , or to any audience , any prayer , indeed , except it be inaudible and in the closet , would seem to be a most dangerous and daring form of spiritual exercise ? a sickening form of idolatry when it is the , mere stringing together of beatific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the spiritual garments , an awful exposure , more curious than helpful . All this phase of the matter is even more apparent to the Oriental than to us , and to them is more disconcerting . The number and the class of the Christian converts in India shows this . They are practically all of the lowest class , for whom the bait of food , in time of famine , and protection have been the main temptations to conversion . But besides the Hindus , and the Christians , and some one hundred thousand Parsis in India , there are the Jains , a sect which exaggerates some of the Buddhist doctrines , as , for example , the extreme concern for animal life , bodily penance as a necessity of salvation , and so on . These people maintain hospitals for useless animals who would otherwise be killed . I have seen two of these compounds , crowded with camels , bullocks , cows , water buffaloes , dogs , cats ; chickens , pigeons , and so on , all kept alive by this fanatical charity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vermin , even when on the person . There are the Sikhs , a sect of Hindus who recognize no distinctions of caste , worship the Granth , or holy book , have their own teachers or gurus , and who were at one time , and even as late as the middle of the eighteenth century , a formidable military power . There are the Marathas , who grew from a military organization of local Hindu tribes I in southern India , into the most formidable military and political power in India at the time of the break-up of the Mughal empire , in the beginning of the eighteenth century . There are the Muhammadans ( they , again , divided into two sects of Shiahs and Sunnis ) , who began their invasions of India about i000 A. D. , and who now number sixty-two millions , or about one-fifth of the total population . There are , besides these , numerous tribes , some of them almost extinct , who are practically savage relics of the aborigines and their Animistic worship . The differences between these various sects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not merely the epicene pulpit quarrels , such as mark our Western theological polemics , matters that do not interfere with inter-dining and dancing , but matters of life and death . Montesqieu writes : " Apres tout , c'est mettre ses conjectures a bien haut prix , qued'enfaire cuire un homme tout vif . " But these people did not hesitate to clothe their beliefs with full sanction to use both fire and sword . So far as one can see , the vitality of these main beliefs is unimpaired , and the pilgrimages to Mecca , to Rangoon , and to Benares show no lessening of numbers nor of enthusiasm . If one is to see anything in Benares except a diversely colored peripatetic laundry on an enormous scale , one must have some such thread of knowledge upon which to string one 's impressions . How can there be any such thing as national or patriotic feeling in India as a whole ! The people of Bombay , of Bengal , of Peshawar , of Madras , of the Punjab can only slowly grow to feel that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so different that the man in Madras can no more understand the man from the Punjab than the Spaniard can understand the Russian . Not only the differences are great , as between a low-class Hindu propitiating demons and worshipping trees , plants , stones , rivers , water-tanks , cows , crocodiles , peacocks ? all held to be sacred in certain parts of India ? and the high-class members of the two reformed bodies , the Arya Somaj and the Brahma Somaj , who reject all idolworship , and have refined the Hindu religious philosophy to the point of radical Unitarianism ; but the numbers are enor- mous . There are over 200,000,000 Hindus , more than 60,000,000 Muhammadans , more than 9,000,000 Buddhists , nearly 9,000,000 Animists , besides Sikhs , Jains , Parsis , and a sprinkling of Jews and Christians . It is estimated that there are 1,544,510 , - 000 people in the world . Of these , 175 , - 290,000 are Muhammadans , 300,000,000 are Confucians , 214,000,000 are Brahmans , 121,000,000 Buddhists , 534,940,000 are Christians , 10,860,000 are Jews , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people in the world live in India and China , and these figures give one some notion of the colossal loaf of paganism that it is the ambition of the missionary to leaven . These figures , too , tell the tale of the bathing , praying thousands on the banks of the river Ganges at Benares , but they give the reader , also , I hope , some idea of the terrifying proportions of the problem of the British ruler in India . He is not only dealing in India with these unknown , and almost incomprehensible , diversities of creed , and custom , and ancient precedent , but also with the problem common to all of us everywhere , of the political status of the individual , of his rights , and of the quality and quantity of his participation in legislation . No Oriental nation will hear that women have been given a vote , and thereby a voice in how they shall be governed , without a vocal and physical protest such as no mutiny even can parallel . Great Britain is being assaulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen among Hindus and Muhammadans , with their notions of the position of women , should women be given the vote , is rather beyond ordinary imaginative powers . Orientals are all born and bred aristocrats . It is the Indians who visit England , and who discover how un-Brahman are many of their rulers there , who return to spread the seeds of discontent even now . The Oriental , of all others , knows the folly of the rights of man . Rousseau begins his Contrat Social : " L'homme ne libre , est partout dans les fers . " The profound error here , but one that has unduly excited the world , is that man is not born free , he is , on the contrary , born in chains . He begins life in chains , chains of parentage , of inheritance , of environment , of capability , of disposition , of looks , of strength , physical and moral . All discussions of liberty are founded upon this gross error . Some men achieve a certain liberty , but they are all , always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the West knows as well as does the Oriental that it is the weak who are always screaming for liberty , while the strong are forever asking for more strength and courage to bear the responsibilities that liberty has put upon them , not the least of which is the protection of the weak , by assuming the right to rule . In these days , indeed , it is very much to be doubted whether the weak are more burdened by the chains of subordination than are the strong by the chains of responsibility . It is an enlightening commentary upon the difficulties to be met in the evolution of the freedom of the individual to read the report of the Society of Comparative Legislation upon the legislation of the empire . For the ten years ending in 1907 twenty-five thousand new laws were made by men for the restriction of their own liberties in the British Empire ! First , men strike off the chains of church , of feudalism , of autocracy which bind them , and then with a new system , with self-government , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberties must have new masters . The variety of problems and peoples in the British Empire is shown by the variety of subjects dealt with by these laws . There are laws punishing witchcraft and widowburning ; there are laws about animals , and even about inanimate objects ? as in Athens , where if a tree fell on a man and killed him the tree was solemnly tried and outlawed . This glut of law-making is by no means confined to the British Empire . We in America have many and ludicrous examples of it . The horse breaks his harness and is free ? free to cut himself to pieces running through the crowded streets . The lion breaks out of his cage and cowers in a corner , bewildered by his freedom . Men break away from one tyranny , only to harness themselves in a mesh of knots and buckles more hampering than before . The intelligence , the experience , and the wisdom of the world have no wish to enslave , or to hamper individual liberty . Certainly we Americans have no such ambi- tion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harness off the horse does not solve the problem . Germany and Japan are ominous examples of how happy is the horse , and how well he goes when harnessed , handled , and housed by one coachman in supreme control . We can not be sure that we are not cutting away at individual initiative , at independence , at personal prowess and courage , by this weaving a web of laws around the individual , even though they be supposedly for his protection and well-being . It may be that he is better off , after all , with a master , rather than with all as masters . This much , at least , must be said for those who hesitate , and counsel delay rather than haste , when dealing with India , and Egypt , and the Philippines . Democracy 's cocksureness may land us all scrambling at the feet of a dictator . Liberty is a far more complicated problem to deal with than tyranny , and few there are who recognize it . Those who read these scanty sketches of the history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India , will , I hope , share with me the feeling that a nation with such a gigantic problem to solve should be judged and criticised with extreme care , and always with a leaning toward leniency , and that we Americans , with our increasing responsibilities , both at home and abroad , in the governing of the colored races , should be the last to criticise ignorantly , or to counsel others to walk , or to walk ourselves , unwarily.
