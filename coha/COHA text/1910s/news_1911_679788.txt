txt FOR LABORThe decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals confirming the injunction against a strike by the Carpenters ' Union of this city was published yesterday . An injunction against a strike is not the same thing as a sentence to involuntary labor , or to labor under unacceptable conditions . On the contrary this injunction against a strike gives a guarantee of the protection of the law to those willing to work and satisfied with their conditions of employment , but who would be unable otherwise to earn their living except at the risk of their lives , and perhaps not even then . The freedom to work in amity with capital of course is freedom for capital to employ willing workmen . Therefore capital and labor  --  except the Carpenters ' Brotherhood  --  are both favored by the injunction against a Conspiracy In restraint of trade of larger proportions than Is generally appreciated . Overwork and underpayment la all that even trades unionists allege against the most detested employers . Such conditions of employment are oppressive and obnoxious , but are preferable to total prohibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such was the sentence which the Car-. penters ' Brotherhood issued against all carpenters except those in the union . The union 's writ in fact ran against all the world except its own members , and was felt heavily in many States . The union forbade all employers of this city to use any of the products of the labor of non-union carpenters , and it forbade employers out of New York to employ non-union carpenters . The roots of the , case spread even more widely than in the hatters ' case , in which Mr. GorePERS pleaded that the Constitution of the Federation of Labor authorized the boycott and asked what the courts would do about it . In that case the sentence of the Federation was that the capitalist who had offended should be excluded from inter-State commerce until he made his peace . In this case the by-laws of the union fine every unionist who works upon the produce of the labor of non-union oarpenters , and strikes and boycotts are the penalties for all employers who seek to use such materials . In this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom none employs less than 100 men , or has an investment less than $100,000 . The entire building industry of the city is concerned , and a good part of the building material industry in other States . Everybody who lives under a roof has a right to construction as cheap as possible , and the object of the defendants to the injunction is to make construction as dear as le practicable , and to confine the distribution of wages among themselves . The motive of the policy , as stated by the attorney for the union in court , is the fact that open-shop labor can supply building material 50 per cent . cheaper than It can be produced in New York union shops . The union pleads that it is friendly to the union shops of this neighborhood , and wishes to protect them from the competition of outside open shops . The method of this protection was for the brotherhood to send from its headquarters at Indianapolis organizer ? to make trouble here for an consumers of open-shop materials , or employers of non-union carpenters . Strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpenters and builders in a considerable proportion of the trade organized and bound themselves , under a penalty of $2,500 , not to use such material . An appeal for protection against such a tyrannous combination in restraint of trade was made to Washington In vain , and the injunction now sustained was procured by private defendants . Capital may be left to look out for itself , having brains and money enough . The helplessness of labor against tyranny by its class is a more serious matter . The injunction now affirmed was granted in the words of Judge Coxes because the right of every American citizen , whether employer or employe , to gain an honest livelihood by his own toil and endeavor is Inherent in our organic law , and should be protected by all the power of the Government The position of the defendants is that only members of their own association stall possess those rights . Any ens of1,900 local unions can refuse membership to any carpenter , and there is no remedy . Yet without such membership no carpenter can exercise the rights Judge Conn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is equally true of all unions , those " organizations not for profit " and practicers of human uplift , who are asking exemption from the anti-trust law , which the Government declines to enforce against them . This case differs from others in that there is neither malice nor grievance on the part of the union . It is not a question of conditions of employment , but of the right to labor for a living . It is not a question affecting any one defendant , for the union declares itself against 6,11 the world . The defendants are honestly blind to the arguments against their claim to monopolize all carpenters ' work for themselves . If the carpenters ' contention be conceded it must be allowed to all other unions , and then the right to labor will exist only for those who hold a union license , and the dearest privilege of wage earners will have vanished . The by-law of the carpenters and the law of the land are in conflict , and one must yield .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
