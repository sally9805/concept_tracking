txt James Dunlop Smith , former President of the Radio Telephone Company , the offices of which were at 40 Exchange Place , but are now in the Metropolitan Tower , was arrested yesterday by Post Office Inspector G. F. H. Birdseye on the charge ( la having used the mails to defraud . When he was arraigned before Commissioner Shields , Assistant United States District Attorney Stephenson declared that the " fraud is almost as-large as the United Wireless and will run into the millions . " Mr. . Stephenson asked that bail be fixed at $25,090 , but on the request of the de , fendant 's counsel , W. B. Voss , it was set at *15,000 , and Smith was paroled until Tuesday in Mr. Voss 's custody . He must then appear before the Commission , er and give bail . According to Inspector Birdseye , who , with Inspectors Charles E. Entemann and W. E. Greenaway , has been at work on the case for some time , the alleged fraud is very similar to that of the United Wireless Company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of wireless teiepnones . Really almost its entire activity was in the distribution of stock . To facilitate this a number of subsidiary companies were formed , such as the Great Lakes Radio Telephone Company , the Atlantic Radio Telephone Company , the Pacific Radio Telephone Company , the Universal Wireless Corporation of South Dakota , with a capital of $50,100 , - 000 , and tile Radio Telephone Construe , tion Company . They were officered , the Inspector said , with the clerks of the ' parent organization , and each of them had to pay a bonus for the rights to the exploitation of the Radio Telephone Company 's inventions over a certain territory . From the payments of these bonuses , it is alleged , the dividends on the Radio Telephone Company 's stock have been paid . The formal complaint , which was sworn to by Inspector Birdseye , charges that on July 19 , 1000 , Smith devised a scheme and artifice to defraud Edith May Lynde of Broadway , Camden , N. J. , and many other persons by inducing them to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lakes Radio Telephone Company , and the Atlantic Radio Telephone Company , the last two named being Arizona corporations . It was represented to the investors that by wireless telephones communication could be established by the human voice between one ship and another or between a ship and the shore , and that its radius was as great as that osf the wireless telegraph . It was also represented , the complaint charges , that the entire equipment needed for wireless telephony was not costly and could easily be installed , and that the attention of electrical experts was needed . As an example of what the new system of telephones could accomplish , it was suggested that if transmitters were installed on the stage of the Met iopolitan Opera House the music could be transmitted to almost every dwelling in the city , and that it would be quite possible for railroad passengers to talk through the radio telephone to their homes while the trains were running at full speed . Inspector Birdseye declared yesterday that the radio telephone was actually installed on the United States battleship fleet for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered and the equipment was discarded . As far as he could learn , the only practical test which the system ever met in any way successfully was between the office of the company in the Metropolitan Tower and its factory in Newark , N. T. Even then the messages were sent only in one direction , and merely fragments of sentences could be understood . The system which the Radio Telephone Company professed to exploit was based on discoveries of Lee De Forrest , but he was in no way concerned with the stock selling methods , and , with W. W. Tompkins , who was convicted and sentenced to one year 's imprisonment for his connection with the United Wireless frauds , ' has given information to the Government . Tompkins . it is understood , expects a pardon for the rest of the year 's imprison- I ment on account of the aid lie is giving ' , to the Government in this case . While Smith was President of the Radio Telephone Company at 41 Exchange Place - he was also President of the Fiscal Agency Company of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a contract with himself as President of the Fiscal Agency Company , Inspector Birdseye said yesterday , to market the Radio Telephone stock . This privilege he afterward sublet to Elmer E. Burlinghame of " bottled sunshine " fame . Shortly before the United Wireless frauds were exploded , however , there was a falling-out between Smith and Burlingame , ns the latter alleged that Smith had been disposing of his own Radio stock . 1The result was that Smith sold out and Burlingame came into complete control of the business . The subsidiary companies were used to get as much money as possible from different sections of the country , and it was represented that to each of them had been assigned the sole right to use the invention in its own territory . Promises were held out to the investors that the companies would earn " quick net protits , " and from time to time checks were distributed which purported to be for the dividends already earned . The complaint charges that these were intended to represent falsely that the companies were being worked at a profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were being operated at a loss . Of late the radio telephone has somewhat dropped into the background , as it was impossible to continue to give it the appearance of success , and a wireless system not without merits has been taken up by the company . I When Smith was arraigned his lawyer protested that he had had no connection with the Radio Telephone Company for three years , and could not be held responsible for the methods employed in disposing of its stock .
