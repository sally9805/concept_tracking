 |p610  THE European conflict is just beginning . No one of the belligerent nations has been touched by war . Each side relishes the battle as much as ever ; is certain of victory : will fight to the end ; is united to a man : unconquerable and determined ? inflexibly. unalterably determined . Both sides command inexhaustible resources . To neither side is it of consequence how long the flow of money and blood continues . Such , at least . is the sum total of official versions as given for publication by civil and military leaders of the several belligerent nations . Such is the outlook . as one sees it , after talks , for example , with Hoffrat Montlong , of the Foreign Office in Vienna : with the German Chancellor , von Bethmann Hollweg ; ith his Excellency von Mumm Schwarzenstein , in the Foreign Office at Berlin : with Galiieni , French Minister of War ; with Colonel Herbst , of the War Office in Sofia ; or Dr. Radoslavoff , the Premier of Bulgaria . Each of them will say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writer , in varying words and with apparently the deepest conviction , that victory is certain for the Central Powers , or the Allies , as the case may be . And when you have compared notes ? such as are left after visits to Balkan jails and the currycombing process of frontier sentries ? you say to yourself : " It is hopeless . Peace is no more possible than on August 4 , 1914 . " On the other hand , you may also study the question through the unofficial eyes of lesser soldiers and the people at large . In that case , if you have struck beneath the surface , you will get a different answer . You will see the body of wounded Europe in a clearer light . Again and again , in ox-cart and in troop train , in trenches and in farmhouse , you will hear the cry go up , " How long can this thing last ? " and you will know that the break may come as unexpectedly as the war ? like a jagged streak of clear lightning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for peace that I got from Huebsch , the German courier between Berlin and Constantinople ; from the French officer who got me through the frontier that midnight at Pontarlier ; from Jacques Gaster , the philosophic Austrian detective who was put on my trail in Bulgaria ; from the widow of Stuttgart whose friend committed suicide while waiting for news from her boy at the front from the doctor of Aix-la-Chapelle who begged me to start a peace propaganda in America ; and from my troop train acquaintance , the restaurant-keeper of Budapest . Among the Central Powers , despite the warlike talk of leaders , signs of discouragement multiply beneath the surface . Beneath the surface . too , lies evidence of exhaustion ? if not in Germany , at least , I think I am justified in saying , among the Teuton* allies to the south . At the time that I was in Bulgaria Dr. V. Radoslavoff , the Premier and right-hand man of King Ferdinand , emphasized his country 's impregnability in an interview which I had with him while the German and Bulgarian forces were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " will be willing to return to their homes as soon as Servia and Macedonia are ceded to us . Until that is done there is no hope for peace , for Germany and Bulgaria will be able to lay down their own terms . " And likewise Ping Ferdinand 's farewell speech to the French Minister at the latter 's departure from Sofia , as reported to me by the American military attache at a certain foreign capital . " Tell your people , " were Ferdinand 's candid words . " that French blood flows in my veins . Say to them that I hope it is not necessary for my soldiers to fight the French . But I have chosen my course because I know that Germany is invincible . " During my stay in Berlin members of the German Foreign Office were equally optimistic and equally convincing . On returning north from the Balkans I went to a member of the Foreign Office in Vienna for permission to break the Great  |p611  Rule that war correspondents shall not cross between enemy frontiers . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and German trenches , and , as matters turned out , was the only war correspondent to receive such permission . My official friend was a long , gray-bearded Austrian , with the incisive speech and nervous manner of the late Joseph Pulitzer . " If you are successful in crossing the border , " he said , jabbing the desk with his paper-cutter , " tell the French that they had better stop fighting . I say this because I am partly of French descent , and am sorry for them . It is useless for them to continue . " " There is no objection to my going ? " " Not if you tell the truth about Austria . Food , as you see for yourself , is plentiful . The people are united . Austria is going to win . How long the struggle lasts is immaterial . " He believed what he said , because he was steeped in the official documents of success , by means of which it was his duty to keep before the public the mechanical appearance of victory . But even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory jumped back to my experiences while rubbing elbows with the masses east of the Rhine ? in Germany , in Austria and Hungary , and later along the Danube ? where I saw more clearly and more deeply beneath the surface into matters altogether unfit for Continental publication . I recalled again Huebsch , the German courier ; Gaster , the philosophic detective ; the sorrowing doctor of Aix-laChapelle ; the widow of Stuttgart ; and , above all , my haggard traveling companion Leo Tzerna , ' the German-speaking restaurant-keeper of Budapest . Tzerna was a second-reserve Landsturm man , just called into service when I met him , and on the way to join his division in Servia . He was far too gray and bent for his fortyseven years , and tired ? so tired that he seemed to drag his body after his eyes . An excited imagination may have lent details to his story . I do not hold the case to be typical ( though there is less cohesion in Austria than in Germany ) , but as evidence of the way the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into our car at two o'clock one morning , when our combination troop and passenger train stopped at a little station in the Hungarian plains , about two or three hundred miles southeast of Budapest . Dawson , the Indiana photographer with whom I was traveling , was snoring on one end of a wooden bench when Tzerna opened the compartment door and deposited his Rucksack . " Do not disturb him , " said Tzerna , speaking in English that betrayed a German background . " I do not wish to sleep . " And he paced the corridor most of the night , muttering to himself . During the first day 's acquaintance he kept up the usual " bluff " which is the custom of patriotic natives in the presence of strangers . " Iss it that you are correspondents ? " he had asked , after listening to scraps of our conversation . I admitted that it was our profession to record the facts of life by means of the kodak and the pen , respectively . " Then you must write that Austria will win . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have very much of money , very much of food , and we get very much new material from Turkey . " " Ja , ja , " cut in the German courier with the harsh staccato voice , who was guarding his precious mail-pouch in the opposite corner . " It can nothing else be but that we shall win . So soon as next spring the English will be of fighting tired . " Later Tzerna joined me while I was stretching my legs at an unpronounceable station where the engineer must have had friends ? for we stayed about an hour . Seventeen hours in the same compartment , added to the fact that I had shown him how to send a censored telegram to his wife , had brought me into Tzerna 's confidence . " Now , honestly , what do you think ? " he asked . " About what ? " " About the war . When do you think I can go home ? It is for a correspondent to understand everything , is it not ? I speak to you as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When do you think the Great Peace will come ? " We continued our talk in our dirty thirdclass compartment , where I shared with the restaurant-keeper a midnight supper of long strips of Wars ' fried over charcoal ( which we had bought from peasants along the road ) and washed down by Schweck , the native Hungarian drink . " You see , " said Tzerna between gulps , " it is to me of much importance what you  |p612  say . I say to you last night that our side would win and that we do not mind the fighting . I ask you if your country will come into the war , and you will not speak with me of that . But I know your country will not fight . With your country business is business , as you say it , and while we here , fight America will become rich . Yes ? And I , Tzerna , the restaurant-keeper . I have had my business too , but the business is no longer good . The business is no longer anything ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is dead ? just as my three sons and my daughter 's husband and the two cousins of my wife are dead . First my business lost a little . That was before my oldest son had his leg frozen in the Carpathian schiitzen trenches Grahcn. and they cut it off . Since then my business has entirely stopped , and during the last year my younger friends , one by one , have gone away to fight . " - " Vhat is your business ? " I asked him . He poured out a cupful of the thin yellow wine and took it at a gulp . The Austrian officer in the opposite corner ? the one on furlough who got into our compartment at Szegedin ? was slicing a piece of cold sausage meat with his army knife . In the neighboring seat the German courier with the pompadour hair and the staccato laugh was snoring loudly ; his fat neck and close-shaven head had rolled over sidewise against the fur collar of the Austrian officer 's coat . " My business , " said Tzerna in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was restaurant-keeper . Do you mind if I tell you of it ? I can not sleep for thinking of many things . Pray accept some of my wine . " To begin with , you must understand that it was twenty-seven years ago that I began my cafe business in the same place where I stayed until last summer , on the Ylatvasstrasse , not far from the Francis Joseph Bridge , which crosses the Danube from Buda to Pest . I did not make anything at first , but the father of my German wife. , he gave me help . I spend the first year getting people to come to my restaurant , building up my ? how do you say it ? " " Clientele . " " Is that it ? Yes , building up the ? clien-tel . And everybody likes the special wine I mix , so the customers stay ; and the gay young men and officers like to talk with my wife when she give them change and to make fun with the pretty waitresses . Very soon the place becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . My boys grow up and go to the Gymnasium , and my girl grow up and study to play music . " And then the war came . It began because Austria must punish Servia . So much is completed . It continue because Germany wish to be greater and richer . It wish to have more land , more space for development , more power ; it wish to have more ships on the ocean , where it can sell its products , and also it need to have more colonies . Now hear me closely ; I must not speak loud . So the great men and the Government continue the war . The you know the man I mean ? make speeches to the Ministers in the Reichstag . The great men do not ask the people what the people wish . They say : ' We give you this war ; it is good for you that you have this war , because your country will become richer and you will become richer when it is over . ' Yes , that is it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is very queer , is it not ? I give my whole life to make my business to grow ; and now comes this war , and my business and my two sons and my daughter 's husband and the two cousins of my wife are gone , and at the age of forty-seven , when I am too old to begin again , I am compelled to fight , and I do not know what will become to my wife , and it is all ? for what ? It is all because that I should become richer and my country should become richer when I am dead and when the war is over ! " At the beginning I lose my money because the soldiers and the younger men who patronize my business are called away to fight . And the others have not so much money to spend and I must pay more to buy provisions . Butter , which then cost me 1.25 kronen for the pound , now cost me 3 kronen for the pound . The beer is very much the same price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pay for it , because it is all taken by the Government for children and sick persons . On two days of the week it is not permitted for me to sell meat in my restaurant , and on one day every week I can not sell pork , and on two days I can not sell any meat fried in butter or in fat products . And no one will buy wine , for no one wishes to have amusement over the wine-glasses , so I do not make money in that way . " The train stopped in an oust-of-the-way spot at a signal of a militaire who boarded to examine our credentials . An impressive gen/ darme with shining top hat and black feathers examined my passport , holding it upside down . He could n't read a word of the various vises , but he checked me off just the same . My name and description had been telegraphed from the last searching station . When the gendarme had gone , the restaurant-keeper contiqued . " In the fourth month of the war my oldest son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died . My wife , Carlotta , say : . The Francko family have two sons dead : so we are happier than they . ' I did not see her weep . " In the spring my second boy . Paul . was killed at Lemberg . When the Feldbriefcame. my Carlotta said , Perhaps the English have more killed than we , and soon the Peace will come . ' I do not remember that she ever cried . But we give up the restaurant business and go to Vienna to be near my daughter , who studies there to play music . and my wife works for the Government in the hospital for the blind . I also work in a factory place where we make ammunition ? but it is not permitted to say where . " In the summer , when I return to Vienna , I can see my wife is not very well . We hear that my daughter 's husband is killed in the Alps ? at Tolmino Pass ? but my wife say only , ' I should wish to know where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is captured and in good hands , and she answer , ' Perhaps it is so . ' " I tell Carlotta what the Government officials say to me at ? that factory where I work . They say Germany and Austria have so many trained soldiers waiting to fight that our side must win soon . Also a new loan has been made , so it gives much of money in the land . " My wife look for a long time out of the window at the river , and then she laugh ? a very queer laugh . " That was several months ago . We have now only the one son who is prisoner ? perhaps . I am let away from the factory city , so my wife and I stay much of the time together . It is five months this way , and we begin again to be a little happy . ib " The last month we have been both afraid ? afraid of something . I have been going twice a week to the drill-grounds , and I know that it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back ? the Landstrtrmberuf the call for me . " The men in my Landsttirm company ? they are all over forty-two ? wrap up a pair of heavy shoes in a paper bundle . and the two flannel shirts which it is required that we take . " You have seen the Landsfurm go There is no brass band to-day , and the people do not sit in the window and watch us and cheer . Everybody is too much of the fighting tired for that . The Lana's/urnz is not always drawn up in order , and they do not really march ; they walk like so many school-girls returning from the school . My company does not yet have the uniform on . I am to go to the station , and from there to the drill-ground , where the uniform will be given to me . We walk through the streets ; many wives and children walk with us , but hardly a word is spoken . It is early in the morning , and therefore the street is very quiet , except that two hundred heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Yes ? We go down Ringstrasse . Then we cross to the Zollamtstrasse and go by the Kriegsministerium. where the names of the hundreds of thousands of gefallen are printed on the wall . The captain was not with us , but some one cry out : ' Honor the dead ! ' " So we throw our feet out high in front and bring them loudly on the pavement down . That is how we saluted the names of the dead of Austria . " An old man standing at the corner take off his hat to us as we go by . " We march over the bridge on the way to the station and down the little Kornerstrasse , where my wife now have a room . " I go through the hall and up to the second floor to say good-by to Carlotta ? my wife Carlotta . " I find her sitting by the window which looks upon the Danube . On the table is the newspaper , the Neue Freie Presse ' of Vienna , in which is a speech which a statesman has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , ' Good-by , Carlotta . ' And then , to make her happy , ' The Peace will soon be here . ' And then I read to her from the speech : " One hundred thousand Landsturm are prepared for service and are anxious to take part in the last of the glorious fight . Russia has been pushed back , Italy checked , and we have driven the enemy from Servia . From our enemies the Peace will come soon . " ' Good-by , I will soon return , Carlot ? '  |p614  Suddenly Carlotta start to laugh . She run from the room ? she shriek I catch her . ' Dearest , good Carlotta , what is it ? ' ' The Peace will come soon she cries . She laugh louder and she pound on the wall and she shriek . " ' The Peace will come soon she shriek out loud and tear up the newspaper and stamp on it and throw is from the window out . ' The Peace will come soon I ' once more she cry . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ac h . Gott . how she laugh Du tither Gott . how she laugh I " " And then you left with your company ? " I asked a few minutes later , while Tzerna was buried in thought " Yes , they called for me to come . I do not see her again . And that is why I can not sleep for the thought of her ? because through my eyes I always see Carlotta , and in my ears I always hear her laughing . Adz , Gott , such a laughing . " The train came to a jolting stop . the German courier yawned , sat upright , and reached for his precious mail-pouch . Tzerna stopped speaking . as if he feared he had been making a fool of himself . He whipped out another of those thin Turkish cigarettes ? the kind with the cardboard mouthpiece ? and in his excitement lighted it at the wrong end . He tossed it away , took another nervous gulp from the Sclaweck bottle , and swung " open the door of our compartment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise lazily over the Hungarian plains , I could hear him pacing up and down the dimly lighted , smoke-filled corridor . Two hours later we watched him as he stepped across the platform at Kronstadt , shouldered his Rucksack , tucked a greasy paper package under his arm , and disappeared with the outgoing Feldzug , eventually bound for " somewhere in Servia . " At Kronstadt , because carefully worked out figures of German losses were found bn my person , I myself was arrested on suspicion of being a spy . Two days later , after being released and making my way to the Rumanian capital , I again ran into my companion in and out of trouble , Dawson , the Indiana movingpicture man . " Funny old bird , that restaurant fellow , " remarked the photographer that night , as we sat on the edge of our bunks in a so-called hotel in Bucharest . Did he give you any interesting dope ? " To me it was interesting " dope . " But the Censor would never have let it through . For , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
