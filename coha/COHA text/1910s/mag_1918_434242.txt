AFTER creeping through slime-filled holes beneath the shrieking of swift metal ; after splashing one 's plane through companionable clouds three miles above the little jagged , hero-filled ditches , and dodging other sudden-born clouds of nauseous fumes and blasting heart of steel ; after these , one craves thoughts of comfortable hens , sweet-apple orchards , or ineffable themes of opera . And when nerves have cried for a time , ' Enough , ' and an unsteady hand threatens to turn a joystick into a sign-post to Charon , the mind seeks amelioration , ? some symbol of worthy content and peace , ? and , for my part , I turn with all desire to the jungles of the tropics . If one looks the jungle straight in the face and transcribes what is seen , there is evolved technical science ; and until this can be done with accuracy and discretion , one can never feel worthy , now and then , of stealing quietly up a side aisle of the great green wonderland , looking obliquely at all things , observing them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softening facts with quiet meditation , leavening science with thoughts of the sheer joy of existence . It should be possible occasionally to achieve this , and yet to return to science enriched and with enthusiasm , and again to play some little part in the great physical struggle ? that wonderful strife which must give to future peace and contentment new appreciation , a worthier enjoyment . It is possible to enter a jungle and become acutely aware of poison fang and rending claw , much as a pacifist considers the high adventure of righteous war . But it is infinitely more wonderful and altogether satisfying to slip quietly and receptively into the life of the jungle ; to accept all things as worthy and reasonable ; to feel the beauty , the joy , the majestic serenity of this age-old fraternity of nature , into whose sanctuary man 's entrance is unnoticed , his absence unregretted . The peace of the jungle is beyond all telling . I am thinking of a very wonderful thing and words come laggardly . For it is a thing which more easily rests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crystallized into words and phrases . It is of the making of a new trail ? of the need and the planning and the achievement , of the immediate effects and possible consequences . For the effects became manifest at once , myriad , unexpected , some sinister , others altogether thrilling and wholly delightful to the soul of a naturalist . And now , many months after , they are still spreading , like a forest fire which has passed beyond control . Only in this case the land was no worse and untold numbers of creatures were better off because of our new trail . Of the stillmore distant consequences I can not write , for the book of the future is tightly sealed . But we may recall that a trail once was cut through coarse , high grass and belts of cedar , which in time became the Appian Way . And a herd of aurochs , breasting in single file dense shrubby oaks and heather toward a salt-lick , may well have foreshadowed Regent Street ; the Place d'Etoile was perhaps first adumbrated by wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the Indian trail , which became a Dutch road and our Fifth Avenue , have had its first hint in a moose-track down the heart of a wooded island , leading to some hidden springy We left our boats stranded on the Pelazaruni River bank and climbed the steep ascent to our new home in the heart of British Guiana . Our outfit was unpacked , and the laboratory and kitchen and bedrooms in the big Kale-coon house were at last more than names . And now we surveyed our little kingdom . One path led down to our boats , another meandered eastward through the hills . But like the feathered end of the magnetic arrow , we drifted as with one will to the south . Here , at the edge of our cleared compound , we were confronted by a tangle . It was not very high , ? twenty feet or so , ? but dense and unbroken . Like newly trapped creatures we paced back and forth along it , looking for an opening . It was without a break . We examined it more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cane-stems hung with festoons of grass-like drapery . One of us seized a wisp of this climbing grass and pulled downward . When he dropped it , his hand dripped blood . He might as well have run a scroll-saw over his fingers . The jungle had shown its teeth . We laughed and retreated to the upper floor for consultation . The sight we saw there decided us . In the distance , not too far , ' to use the hopelessly indefinite Guiana vernacular , high over the tumbled lower growths , towered the real jungle ? the high bush . This was the edge of that mighty tropical ocean of foliage , that sea of life with its surface one hundred , two hundred feet above the earth , stretching unbroken to the Andes ; leagues of unknown wonderland . And here we were , after thousands of miles of voyaging to study the life of this great jungle , to find our last few yards blocked by a mass of vegetation ! There was no dissenting voice . We must cut a trail , and at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail , it will be wise to try to understand this twenty . foot tangle , stretching almost a mile back from Kalacoon . Three years before , it was pure jungle . Then man came , with axe and saw and fire , and one by one the great giants were felled , ? mora , greenheart , crabwood , ? each crashing its way to earth after centuries of upward growth . The underbrush in the dark , high jungle is comparatively scanty . Light-starved and fungus-plagued , the shrubs and saplings are stunted and weak . So , when only the great stumps were left standing , the erstwhile jungle showed as a mere shambles of raw wood and shriveled foliage . After a time fire was applied ; and quickly , as in the case of resinous trees , or with long , slow smoulderings of half-rotted , hollow giants , the huge boles were consumed . For a period , utter desolation reigned . Charcoal and gray ash covered everything . No life stirred . Birds had flown , reptiles and insects made their escape or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the watch for some half-charred creature . Almost at once , however , the marvelous vitality of the tropical vegetation asserted itself . Phoenix-like , from the very heart of the ashes , appeared leaves of strange shape and color . Stumps whose tissues seemed wholly turned to charcoal sent forth adventitious shoots , and splintered boughs blossomed from their wounds . Now was the lowest ebb of the jungle 's life , when man , for the success of his commercial aims , should take instant advantage . But plans miscarried , and the ruin wrought was 101 to Nature . The destruction of the jungle had been complete , and the searing flames had destroyed all forest seeds . In their place , by some magic , there sprang up at once a maze of weeds , vines , and woody shrubs , reeds , ferns , and grasses , all foreign to the dark jungle , their nearest congeners miles away . Yet here were their seeds and spores , baffling all attempts at tracing their migration or the time they had lain dormant . When we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , by comparing various spots , to follow its growth in past time . The first things to appear in the burned jungle area were grasses or grass-like plants and prostrate vines . These latter climbed over the fallen tree-trunks , and covered the charred stumps with a glory of blossoms ? white convolvulolls gleaming everywhere , then pale yellow allemandes , and later , orchid-like , violet , butterfly peas , which at first flowered among the ashes , but climbed as soon as they found support . Little by little , a five-finger vine flung whole chains of bloom over stumps , logs , and bushes ? a beautiful , blood-red passion flower , whose buds looked like strings of tiny Chinese lanterns . Soon another type of plant appeared , with hollow and jointed stems , pushing out fans of fingered leaves , swiftly , wasting no time in branching , but content with a single spike piercing up through strata of grass and reeds , through shrubs and bushes , until it won to the open sky . This was the cecropia , or trumpet tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the neglected tangle . rOL. 122-NO. n We started early one morning , with small axes and sharp machetes , and in single file began to cut and hew and tear a narrow trail southward . For some distance we found almost a pure culture of the cecropia trees , through which we made rapid progress which aroused entirely false hopes . It was a joy to crash obliquely through the crisp hollow stems at one blow from our great knives . The second man cut again at the base , and the rest took the severed stems and threw or pushed them to one side , cutting away any smaller growths . We soon learned to be careful in handling the stems , for they were sanctuary for scores of a small stinging ant , whose race had practised preparedness for many generations , and which rushed out when the stem was split by cutlass or axe . As we went on , we learned that differences in soil , which were not apparent when the great jungle covered everything , had now become of much importance . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start which they needed for their vertical straightaway dash . Here a community of hollow reeds or bamboo grass appeared from no one knows where . They had grown and multiplied until their stems fairly touched one another , forming a dense , impenetrable thicket of green , silicious tubes eight to twelve feet in length . These were smooth and hard as glass , and tapered beautifully , making wonderfully light and strong arrows , with which our Alcawai Indians shot fish . Slow indeed was our progress through this . The silica dulled and chipped our blades , and the points of the cut stems lamed us at a touch . But whatever the character of the vegetation , whether a tangle of various thorny nightshades , a grove of cecropies , or a serried phalanx of reeds , the terrible razor-grass overran all . Gracefully it hung in emerald loops from branch to branch , festooning living foliage and dead stump alike , with masses of slender fronds . It appeared soft and loose-hung , as if one could brush it away with a sweep of the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , insidiously cutting to the bone as we grasped it , and binding all this new growth together with bands more efficient than steel . The age-old jungle is kind to the intruder ; its floor is smooth and open , one 's footsteps fall upon soft moss , the air is cooled and shadowed by the foliage high overhead . Here , in this mushroom growth of only three years , our progress became slower and ever more difficult . Our hands bled and were cut until we could barely keep them gripped about the cutlass handles ; our trail opened up a lane down which poured the seething heat of the sun 's direct rays ; thorns penetrated our moccasins , and ants dropped down our necks , and bit and stung simultaneously with opposite ends of their anatomy . Five minutes ' chopping and hacking was all that the leader could stand , who would then give way to another . Fifty yards of a narrow lane represented our combined efforts the first day . Direction was a constant source of trouble . Every three or four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the tangle . Sudden gullies blocked us ; a barren , half-open , sandy slope cheered us for a few yards . It was Nature 's defense , and excelled any barbed-wire entanglement I have ever seen since at the battle-front . Once I came to a steep concealed gully . The razor-grass had been particularly bad , giving like elastic to blows of the cutlass , and then flying back across my face . I was adrip with perspiration , panting in the heat , when I slid part way down the bank , and , chopping away a solid mass of huge elephant 's ears , uncovered a tree-trunk bridging the swamp . It brought to mind the bridge from Bad to Worse in the terrible Dubious Land . Strange insects fled from the great leaves , lizards whisked past me , hummingbirds whirred close to my face ? the very sound seeming to increase the heat . I slipped and fell off the log , splashing into the hot water and warm mud , and sat in it for a while , too fagged to move . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he clambered slowly to the top of the next rise , and there caught sight of the jungle 's edge ; it seemed a trifle nearer , and we went on with renewed courage . Shortly afterwards two of us were resting in a patch of reeds while the third worked some distance ahead , when there came a sudden low growl and rush . Instinctively we rose on the instant , just in time to see a jaguar swerve off to one side and disappear in a swish of swaying reed-stems . I have never known one of these animals to attack a man , and in this case he had undoubtedly heard but not scented us , and the attack ceased the moment we proved to be other than deer or similar prey . The incident came and passed too swiftly for thought : but now , when we realized that this was a bit of the real wild life of the jungle , our enthusiasm never flagged , and we kept stead . ily at the heartbreaking work , resting only now and then for our cuts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guest , took pity on us , and for science ' sake , obtained special dispensation . One morning we went out and found in our compound several huge , blue-uniformed policemen , who saluted , and with real black magic produced twenty convicts ? negroes and coolies ? armed with cutlasses . So began the second phase of what we now named the Convict Trail . We had already fought our painful way through a half mile of the terrible maze , and now we heartily welcomed this new aid , whether good-natured murderers and burglars , or , like Sippy , Slorg , and Slith , mere thieves . We watched them strip to their black skins and begin a real assault . On a front of ten to fifteen feet , the tangle fairly dissolved before our eyes , and their great tough palms and soles made little moment of the razor-grass and thorns . With my friend Hope , an honest forger , I went on far ahead and laid the course for the jungle . In especially dense parts we climbed to the summit of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Day after day the score of convicts returned with their guards , and at last we saw the path unite with an old game and Indian trail in the cool shade of the jungle , and Kalacoon was in direct contact with the great tropical forest . I have passed lightly over the really frightful pain and exhaustion which we experienced in the initial part of this work , and which emphasized the tremendous difference between the age-old jungle untouched by man , and the terrible tangle which springs after he has destroyed the primeval vegetation . After this came our reward , and never a day passed but the trail yielded many wonderful facts . The wilderness creatures soon found this wide swath , and day and night used it , making it an exciting thing to peer around a corner , to see what strange beings were sitting or feeding in our little street . Before the trail was quite completed , it yielded one of the most exciting hunts of our trip ? the noosing of a giant bushmaster , the most deadly serpent of the Tropics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trogons , and Easter eve ? these things led to the capture of the Master of the Bush ; for nothing in the Tropics is direct , premeditated . My thoughts were far from poisonous serpents when Nupee came into our Kalacoon laboratory late on a Saturday afternoon . Outdoors he had deposited the coarser game intended for the mess , consisting , to-day , of a small deer , a tinamou or maam , and two agoutis . But now , with his quiet smile , he held out his lesser booty , which he always brought in to me , offering in his slender , effeminate hands his contribution to science . Usually this was a bird of brilliant plumage , or a nestful of maam 's eggs , with shells like great spheres of burnished emeralds . These he would carry in a basket so cunningly woven from a single palm-frond , that it shared our interest in its contents . To-day he presented two nestling trogons , and this was against rules . For we desired only to know where such nests were , there to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sabe we no want bird here . Must go and show nest , eh ? ' Me sabe . ' Accompanied by one of us , off he started again , without a murmur . In the slanting rays of the suit he walked lightly clown the trail from Kalacoon , as if he had not been hunting since early dawn . An hour passed , and the sun swung still lower , when a panting voice gasped out , ? Huge labaria , yards long ! Big as leg ! ' The flight of queen bees and their swarms , the call to arms in a sleeping camp , create somewhat the commotion that the newsof the bushmaster aroused with us . For he is really what his name implies . What the elephant is to the African jungles and the buffalo to Malaysia , this serpent is to the Guiana wilderness . He fears nothing , save one thing , hunting ants , before which all the world flees . And this was the first bushmaster of the rainy season . Nupee had been left to mount guard over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree . Already the light was failing ; so we walked rapidly , with gun , snake-pole , and canvas bag . Parrakeets hurtled bamboowards to roost ; doves scurried off , and small rails flew from our path and flopped into the reeds . Our route led from the open compound of Kalacoon , through the freshly cut Convict Trail , toward the edge of the high bush ; and we did not slacken speed until we were in the dim light which filtered through the western branches . At the top of the slope we heard a yell , ? a veritable Red Incline yell , ? and there our Akawai hunter was dancing excitedly about , shouting to us to come on . ' Snake , he move ! Snake , he move ! ' We arrived , panting , and he tremblingly led me along a fallen tree and pointed to the dead leaves . I well knew the color and pattern of the bushmaster . I had had them brought to me dead , and had killed them myself , and I had seen them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thinking bushmaster and looking bushmaster , my eyes insisted on registering dead leaves . Eager as I was to begin operations before darkness closed down , it was a full three minutes before I could honestly say , ' This isleaf ; thatis snake . ' The pattern and pigment of the cunningly arranged coils were that of the jungle-floor , anywhere ; a design of dead leaves , reddish-yellow , pinkish , dark-brown , etched with mould , fungus , and decay , and with all the shadows and high lights which the heaped-up plant tissues throw upon one another . In the centre of this dread plaque , this reptilian mirage , silent and motionless , rested the head . I knew it was triangular and flattened , because I had dissected such heads in times past ; but now my senses revealed to me only an irregularity in the contour , a central focus in this jungle-mat the unraveling of which spelt death , It was a big snake , seven or eight feet long , and heavy-bodied ? by no means a one-man job . Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each looked behind for a possible line of escape . I quickly formed my method of attack . Nupee was sent to cut forked sticks ; but his enthusiasm at liming work to do away from the scene of immediate conflict was so sincere , that he vanished altogether and returned with the sticks only when our shouts announced the end of the struggle . An Indian will smilingly undergo any physical hardship , and he will face any creature in the jungle , except the bushmaster . Be approached from three sides , bringing snake-pole , free noose , and gun to bear . Slowly the noose on the pole pushed nearer and nearer . I had no idea how he would react to the attack ? whether he would receive it quietly , or , as I have seen the king cobra in Burma , become enraged and attack in turn . The cord touched his nose , and he drew back close to some bushy stems . Again it dangled against his head , and his tongue played like lightning . And now he sent forth the warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the tip of his tail became a blur , the rough scales rasping and vibrating against the dead leaves , and giving out a sound not less sharp and sinister than the instrumental rattling of his near relatives . For a moment the head hung motionless , then the noose-man made a lunge and pulled his cord . The great serpent drew back like a flash , and turning , undulated slowly away toward the darker depths of the forest . There was no panic , no fear of pursuit in his movements . He had encountered something quite new to his experience , and the knowledge of his own power made it easy for him to gauge that of an opponent . He feared neither deer nor tapir , yet at their approach he would sound his warning as a reciprocal precaution , poison against hoofs . And now , when his warning had no effect on this new disturbing thing , he chose dignifiedly to withdraw . I crept quickly along on one side , and with the gun-barrel slightly deflected his course , so that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bush-ropes . Here the pole-man awaited him , the noose spread and swaying a few inches from the leaves . Steadily the snake held to his course , and without consciousness of danger , pushed his head cleanly into the circle of cord . A sudden snap of the line and pandemonium began . The snake lashed and curled and whipped up a whirlpool of debris , while one of us held grimly on to the noose and the rest tried to disentangle the whirling coils and make certain of a tight grip close behind the head , praying for the screw-eyes to hold fast . Even with the scant inch of neck ahead of the noose , the head had such play that I had to pin it down with the gun-barrel before we dared seize it . When our fingers gained 1 heir safe hold and pressed , the great mouth opened wide , a gaping expanse of snowy-white tissue , and the inch-long fangs appeared erect , each draped under the folds of its sheath like a rapier beneath a courtier 's cloak . When once the serpent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was fortunate , for in the dim light we stumbled more than once as we sidled and backed through the maze of lianas and over fallen logs . Nupee now appeared , unashamed and wide-eyed with excitement . He followed and picked up the wreck of battle ? gun , hats , and bags , which had been thrown aside or knocked off in the struggle . With locked step , so as not to wrench the long body , we marched back to Kalacoon . Now and then a great shudder would pass through the hanging loops , and a spasm of muscular stress that tested our strength . It was no easy matter to hold the snake , for the scales on his back were as rough and hard as a file , and a sudden twist fairly took the skin off one 's hand . I cleaned his mouth of all dirt and debris , and then we laid him on the ground , and , without stretching , found that he measured a good eight feet and a half . With no relaxing of care , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his home until he was liberated in his roomier quarters in the Zoological Park in New York . ut Close to the very entrance of the Convict Trail , behind Kalacoon , stood four sentinel trees . Every clay we passed and repassed them on the way to and from the jungle . For many days we paid very little attention to them , except to be grateful for the shade cast by their dense foliage of glossy leaves . Their trunks were their most striking feature , the bark almost concealed by a maze of beautifully colored lichens , different forms overlapping one another in many places , forming a palimpsest of gray , white , pink , mauve , and lilac . One day a streaked flycatcher chose the tip of a branch for her nest , and this we watched and photographed and robbed for science ' sake , and again we thought no more of the four trees . Late in April , however , there came a change . The leaves had been shed some time in January , and the fallen foliage formed a dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each branch and twig began to send out clusters of small buds , and one day ? a week after Easter ? these burst into indescribable glory . Every lichened bough and branch and twig was lined with a soft mass of bloom , clear , bright cerise , which reflected its brilliance on the foliage itself . After two days a rain of stamens began , and soon the ground beneath the trees was solid cerise , a carpet of tens of thousands of fallen stamens . This is no exaggeration , for in each blossom there were more than four hundred stamens , and within the length of a foot , on one small branch , were often a score of blooms . This feast of color was wonderful enough , and it made us want to know more of these trees . But all the information we could glean was that they were called French cashew . Yet they had not nearly finished with the surprises they had in store . A hummingbird or two was not an uncommon sight along the trail at any time ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then it was observed that the tiny birds seemed to focus their flight upon one part of the clearing , and this proved to be the four cashew trees . The next few days made the trees ever memorable : they were the Mecca of all the hummingbirds in the jungle . In early morning the air for many yards resounded with a dull droning , as of a swarming of giant bees . Standing or sitting beneath , we could detect the units of this host , and then the individuals forced themselves on our notice . Back and forth the hummers swooped and swung , now poising in front of a mass of blossom and probing deeply among the stamens , now dashing off at a tangent , squeaking or chattering their loudest . The magnitude of the total sound made by these feathered atoms was astounding : piercing squeaks , shrill insect-like tones , and now and then a real song , diminutive trills and warbles , as if from a flock of song-birds a very long distance away . Combats and encounters were fre quent ? some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it in earnest , their humming and squeaks and throb of wings were audible above the general noise . This being an effect , I looked for the cause . The massed cerise bloom gave forth comparatively little perfume ; but at the base of each flower , hidden and protected by the twenty-score densely ranked stamens , was a cup of honey ; not a nectary , with one or two delicately distilled drops , but a good thimbleful , a veritable stein of liquor . No creature without a long proboscis or bill could penetrate the chevaux-de-frise of stamens , and to reach the honey the hummingbirds had to probe to their eyes . They came out with forehead well dusted with pollen , and carried it to the next blossom . The destiny of the flower was now fulfilled , the pot of honey might dry up , the stamens rain to the earth , and the glory of Tyrian rose pass into the dull hues of decay . Day after day , as we watched this kaleidoscope of vegetable and avian hues , we came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were at least fifteen species , and all had their peculiarities of flight and plumage so marked that they soon became recognizable at sight . After our eyes had become accustomed to specific differences in these atoms of birds , we began to notice the eccentricities of individuals . This was made easy by the persistence with which certain birds usurped and clung to favorite perches . One tufted midget , clad in resplendent emerald armor , selected a bare twig on a nearby shrub , and from there challenged every hummer that came in sight , whether larger , smaller , or of his own kind . He considered the cashew trees as his own special property , and so far as his side of them went , he made good his claim , I have never seen such a concentration of virile combative force in so condensed a form . In some such way as vultures concentrate upon carrion , so news of the cashew sweets had passed through the jungle . Not by any altruistic agency we may be certain , as we watch the selfish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as with the vultures , by the jealous watching of each other 's actions . I observed closely for one hour , and counted one hundred and forty six hummingbirds coming to the tree . During the day at least one thousand must visit it . They did not have a monopoly of the cashew manna , for now and then a honey-creeper or flower-pecker flew into the tree and took toll of the sweets . But these were scarcely noticeable . We had almost a pure culture of hummingbirds to watch and vainly to attempt to study , for more elusive creatures do not exist . The Convict Trail revealed no more beautiful sight than this concentration of the smallest , most active , and most gorgeous birds in the world . Such treats ? floral and avian ? were all that might be expected of any tree , but the cashews had still more treasures in store . The weeks passed , and we had almost forgotten the flowers and hummingbirds , when a new odor greeted us ? the sweet , intense smell of over-ripe fruit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there , and simultaneously there arrived the hosts of fruit-eating birds . From the most delicate of turquoise honey-creepers to great red and black grosbeaks , they thronged the trees . All day a perfect stream of tanagers ? green , azure , and wine-colored ? flew in and about the manna . And for a whole week we gloried in this new feast of color , before the last riddled cashew dropped , to be henceforth the prize of great wasps and gauze-winged flies , which guzzled its fermented juice and helped in the general redistribution of its flesh ? backAo the elements of the tropic mould , to await the swarms of fingering rootlets , a renewed synthesis ? to rise again for a time high in air , again to become part of blossom and bird and insect . ry It was along this Convict Trail that I sank the series of pits which trapped unwary walkers of the night ; and halfway out , at pit number 5 , the army ants waged their wonderful warfare . ' In fact , it was while watching operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found myself all unintentionally in the sleeping chamber of the heliconias . Tired from a long day 's work in the laboratory , I wandered slowly along the Convict Trail , aimlessly , in that wholly relaxed state which always seems to invite small adventures . It is a mental condition wholly desirable , but not to be achieved consciously . One can not say , ' Lo , I will now be relaxed , receptive . ' It must come subconsciously , unnoticed , induced by a certain wearied content of body or mind ; and then many secret doors stand ajar , any one of which may be opened and passed if the gods approve . My stroll was marked at first , however , by only one quaint happening . For several weeks the jolly little trail lizards had been carrying on most enthusiastic courtships , marked with much bowing and posingand a terrific amount of scrambling about . The previous day ? that of the first rains ? numbers of lizardlets appeared , and at the same time the brown tree-lizards initiated their season of love-making . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combats wholly futile so far as any damage was concerned . But the vanquished invariably gave up to his conquerer the last thing he had swallowed , the victor receiving it in a gluttonous rather than a gracious spirit , but allowing his captive to escape . I surprised one of these dark brown . chaps in the trail , and seized him well up toward the head , to preserve his tail intact . Hardly had I lifted him from the ground , when he turned his head , considered me calmly with his bright little eyes , and forthwith solemnly spat out a still living ant in my direction . The inquiring look he then gave me was exceedingly embarrassing . Who was I , not to be bound in chivalry by the quaint customs of his race ! With dignity and certainty of acceptance he had surrendered ; calmly and without doubt he had proffered his little substitute of sword . It was , I felt , in finitely preferable to any guttural and cowardly Kamerad ! ' Feeling rather shamefaced , I accepted the weakly struggling ant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and opened my fingers . He went as he had surrendered , with steadiness and without terror . From the summit of a fallen log he turned and watched me walk slowly out of sight , and I at least felt the better for the encounter . Of all tropical butterflies heliconias seem the most casual and irresponsible . The background of the wings of many is jet-black , and on this sable canvas are splashed the boldest of yellow streaks and the most conspicuous of scarlet spots . Unquestionably protected by nauseous body-fluids , they flaunt their glaring colors in measured , impudent flight , weaving their way slowly through the jungle , in the face of lizard and bird . Warningly colored they assuredly are . One can not think of them except as flitting aimlessly on their way , usually threading the densest part of the undergrowth . No butterflies are more conspicuous or easier to capture . They must feed , they must pay court and mate , and they must stop long enough in their aimless wanderings to deposit their eggs on particular plants , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are consummations hidden from the casual observer . Now , however , I am prepared for any unexpected meaningful trait , for I have surprised them in a habit which presupposes memory , sociability , and caution , manifested at least subconsciously . The late afternoon had worn on , and after leaving my lizard , I had squatted at the edge of a small glade . This glade was my private property , and the way by which one reached it from the nearby Convict Trail was a pressure trail , not a cut one . One push : d one 's way through the reeds , which flew back into place and revealed nothing . Lifting my strained eyes from the tragedies of a hastening column of army ants , I saw that an unusual number of heliconias was flitting about the glade ? both species , the Reds and the Yellows . All were fluttering slowly about , and as I watched , one by one they alighted on the very tips of bare twigs , upside down with closed wings . In this position they were almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigments , which blended with the pastel colors of twilight in the glade , reflected from variegated leaves and from the opening blossoms of the scarlet passion-vine . Perhaps the most significant fact of this sleeping posture was the very evident protection it at ' - forded to butterflies , which in motion during their waking hours are undoubtedly warningly colored and advertised to the world as inedible . Hanging perpendicularly beneath the twig , although they were almost in the open , with little or no foliage overhead , they presented no surface to the rain of the night , and all faced northeast ? the certain direction of both rain and wind . The first one or two roosting butterflies I thought must be due to accidental association ; but I soon saw my error . I counted twelve of the Red-spots and eight Yellows on two small bushes , and a few minutes ' search revealed forty-three more . All were swung invariably from the tips of bare twigs , and there was very evident segregation of the two kinds , one on each side of the glade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colorful flurry , flapped about for a minute or less , and returned , each to its particular perch . After two or three gentle waves of the wings and a momentary shifting of feet , they settled again to perfect rest . This persistent choice of position was invariably the case , as I observed in a number of butterflies which had recognizable tears in their wings . No matter how often they were disturbed , they never made a mistake in the number of their cabin . A certain section of a particular twig on a definite branch was the resting place of some one heliconia , and he always claimed it . Several were bright and fresh , newly emerged , but the remainder were somewhat faded and chipped at the edges . The delicate little beings slept soundly . I waited until dusk began finally to settle down , and crept gently toward a Red-spot . I brought my face close and aroused no sign of life . Then I reached up and slowly detached the butterfly from its resting-place . It moved its feet slightly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I replaced it , and at the touch of the twig , its feet took new hold . When I released its wings , it did not fly but sank back into the same position as before . I wondered if I was the first scientist to pluck a sleeping butterfly from a jungle-tree and replace it unawakened . At the time I was more impressed by the romantic beauty of it all than by its psychological significance . I wondered if heliconias ever dreamed . I compared the peacefulness of this little company with the fierce ants which even now were just disappearing from view . These were my thoughts , rather than later meditations on whether this might not be a sort of atavistic social instinct , faintly reminiscent of the gregariousness of their caterpillar youth . From any point of view I shall think better of all butterflies for this discovery : their desire for company , the instinctive wisdom of place and posture , the gentleness and silence of the little foregathering in the jungle . As I walked back along the trail , several latecomers passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their glade of dreams . Subsequent visits to this glade emphasized the strength of association of this little fraternity , by realization of its temporal brevity . Three weeks after I first discovered the glade , I returned in late afternoon , and waited silently . For a time I feared that the mariposal fellowship was a thing of the past . But a few minutes before five , the first Red-spot fluttered by , in and out among the twigs and leaves , as one slips an aeroplane through openings in drifting clouds . One by one , from all directions , the rest followed , until I counted twelve , twenty , thirty-four . Many of the twigs were now vacant , and most of the heliconias were tattered and forlorn , just able to keep at their fluttering level . There was something infinitely pathetic in this little company , which in less than a month had become so out-at-elbow , so aged , with death close ahead , yet with all their remaining strength making their way from north and from south , from ? dense and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , somnolent communion . I rose quietly and passed carefully from the glade , disturbing none of the paper-thin silhouettes , so like'the foliage in outward seeming , yet so individual , each perhaps with dim dreams of flowers and little meetings and windtossings ; certainly with small adventures awaiting their awakening on the morrow , and a very certain kismet such a short way ahead . Two weeks after this , only three butterflies came to the glade , one newly painted , freshly emerged , the other two old and tattered and very weary . I loitered on my homeward way , and before I reached Kalacoon found myself in the Convict Trail in full moon . light . At one turn of the path a peculiar tinkling reached my ear . It was a veritable silver wire of sound ? so high , so tenuous that one had to think as well as listen , to keep it in audible focus . I pushed through a growth of cecropias , and at once lost the sound , never to hear it again , but in its place there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone and exposed , bathed in full moonlight , and yet gleaming as brightly as if silhouetted against complete darkness , by the greenish light of numberless fireflies . After the first marvel of the sudden sight , I approached and pulled down a branch , and counted twenty-six glowing insects , as close together as the blossoms on a Japanese cherry-stem . There were hundreds upon hundreds , all clustered together in candelabra 'd glory , hidden from the view of all the world , at the farther side of this dense thicket . As I left , I remembered with gratitude the silver wire of sound which had guided me , and in a far corner of my mind I stored a new memory ? one which I could draw upon at need in times of pain , or intolerance , or perhaps in some lull of battle ; the thought of a tree all aglow with living flames , in the moonlight of the Convict Trail .
