England has discovered the " Post-Impressionists , " the name , it seems , by which the most prominent supporters of Les Independents and the Salon , d'Autownie in Paris are now to be known . London , had it chosen , could long ago have discovered them , several of the group having been already shown in the exhibitions of the International Society , where , for a while , in its best days , all that was most promising and individual in the art of the Continent had a place . But London , only beginning to draw breath after its startled discovery of the romanticists and impressionists , needed something more than a few pictures in one annual exhibition to realize that the art world in Paris does not stand still , whatever is the rule on this side of the Channel . The " something more " takes the form of the representative exhibition just opened in the Grafton Gallery , in which the new movement , as it is called , can be studied from Menet , rather illogically included , to Matisse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting collection is not the venture of a few sympathetic artists here or of enterprising French dealers , who have usually been responsible for such daring departures in the past , but is given with , I might say , official sanction : for its honorary and executive committees include the keepers of the National Gallery , the Wallace Collection , and the King 's Pictures ; the directors of the National Portrait Gallery and two or three provincial galleries ; writers like Herbert Cook and Roger Fry , who hitherto have identified themselves with masters accredited by time ; and the More or less distinguished people who lend their names to any approved scheme for the encouragement of art . The artists may be independent at home in France , but in England they appear under the most correct and conventional patronage . And though the British public , unabashed by this patronage , laughs in front of the pictures , the British critics , with one or two exceptions , are respectful , even enthusiastic : frankly afraid to be again Caught napping . I have already pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a master any one of the younger men in England who reveals the slightest personality in his work . And so , in the Grafton Gallery , they are ready at least to suspect genius everywhere . In the old days they latighed at the Pre-Raphaelites , and Millais and Holman Hunt to-day lie in St. Paul 's : therefore it msy be wise to take Van Gogh seriously . They ridiculed Whistler , and he now is ranked high with the elect : for which reason it would probably be safer , anyway , to honor Matisse without delay . Manet 's Olympia was received with derision , and to-day hangs in the Louvre ; who knows if that may not be the fate of Gaugain 's nude ? L'Esprit Veillethe brown woman of Tahiti stretched out upon her bed of white , with its barbaric ornament ? The artists represented are said to be revolutionary . But revolution , if there is any , is rather on the part of the British authorities and critics who have actually dared to abandon their old safe policy of sitting tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , as I have said , interesting , but it would be no great novelty or innovation to anybody who has followed recent movements and developments among artists in France . The work of some of the exhibitors , Matisse , for instance , is , I fancy , far better known by this time in New York than in London . The interest really is in the work itself , though far more is made of the artists ' theories and principles by their British critics and would-be admirers . The artists are praised for their wish to escape tradition and assert their own personality , which is , we are told , the creed of the Post-Impressionists . But no artist to-day can escape tradition , ? though he may defy it ; to express his own individuality has been , the aim of every artist since the world began . Certainly , there is no escape from tradition , no genuine attempt to escape in , this series of pictures . and drawings . They are the work of sound draughtsmen and well-trained technicians . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the modern artist 's subservience to tradition that Manet , who really has no business here , is included . There is a fair Collection of his pictures , shortly , I understand , to figure in the salesroom . They hang in the first gallery , together with-several by Cezanne , and the most important are so well-known that it would be more ethan useless for me to describe themUn Bar aux Folies-Berghres , Au ' Caf ? , La Promenade  --  and they show , as all Manet 's work does , that in whatever personal way ' he may have chosen to express himself , he brought to the expression a due reverence for tile past , for the inheritance of knowledge and law ( a very different thing from academic convention ) which had come down to him through many and distinguished generations of artists . But , indeed , the men who were Manet 's contemporaries were all careful to begin by studying the old masters as well as nature . Fortunately , a number of Manne 's pictures  --  landscapes , still-life , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not , you must recognize its seriousness ; usually it interests and often impresses you . There is no mistaking its individuality ; for the simple reason that he had an individuality to infuse into it , without the effort too obvious in the work of some of his followers . He strove for simplicity . He eliminated the unessential until , in his land , scapes , a large stretch of country like his Paysage St. Cloud or his sombre and impressive Les Maisons is reduced to an arrangement of the lines of the composition rather than the planes which so preoccupy most modern landscape painters ; until in his portraits , as in the Madame Cezanne , the figure and even the hangings of the background become sculpturesque ; until in his still-life the fruit , the table linen , or whatever it may be , seems carved rather than painted . But in none of these is there any going back to the elemental , to the primitive attitude of the primitive artist ; in , none is there any endeavor to escape from all that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pre-historic draughtsman on the walls of his cave . It took all the centuries that have intervened to make just this ' work possible , centuries of rebels , if rebellion in art means the ambition of the artist to master tradition that he may carry it on still further . It is the same when it comes to the then of a later generation . Here is-Maurice Denis , with his Calypso and Orphee . They are not primitive , in the elementary sense , as enthusiasts would have us believe all the pictures of these modern Frenchmen are . Only a fine draughtSman and a fine technician , with generations of fine drawing and technique behind him , could have designed them . But they have been simplified until only the rhythmical lines of the composition remain , only the conventionalized distribution of the spaces of color  --  though convention is a term Denis and the others might scorn . It is the same , with Matisse , in whose Femme aux Yeux Verts the modelling disappears and the figure , a half-length , and the bases behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it is with many of the others . Indeed , in their presence the student who came unprepared , having heard nothing of their theories and principles , would never for a minute imagine they were striving to return to primitive conditions in art , but would conclude , rather , that their chief object is to perfect a new decorative formula based on Puvis de Chavannes , and all that Puvis derived by sympathetic study from the great decorations of the early Italians ; though they bring to this work a self-consciousness that at times threatens to plunge them into deliberate eccentricity . Matisse 's Lady with the Green Eyes does not belong by rights to a small panel shut in by a frame , nor do Denis 's scenes from the Odyssey : they might be so-many fragments of so many different schemes for mural decoration . This is not quite so true of Van Gogh and Gaugain , to both of whom a great deal of space is devoted at the Grafton . Van Gogh , as seen here , is , if anything , more concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iris or of sun-flowers , his tall autumn-tinged trees against the green landscape , his reminiscences of Rembrandt and of Delacroix , his country near Arles , all keep their place within the frame , and none more so than his little canvas of Les TIsines , with the line of wonderfully put-in red roofs between fields and sky . Others of his pictures now shown have the vigor less of primitiveness than of madness , and , in both the famous Berceuse and the portrait of Dr. Gachet , Van Gogh 's devoted friend and patron , the force which can not be denied is pushed beyond the limits of the sane in art , into morbidness and exaggeration . The few expressive lines with which the figure of the Berceuse is suggested and the flat space of green made by her apron are in strong contrast to the carefully worked-out , flower-strewn background ; while the color scheme of the Dr. Gachet , in its full blues and whites , and the rendering of character in the face , seem to emphasize the violent directness of the technique and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fame of Van Gogh has been , perhaps , unduly inflated of late years , some say for reasons which are not difficult to guess , but , thanks to much of the work he left , work done in his calmer moments , it will surely outlive the present vogue . To ' be honest , I must admit that Gaugain mak6 no appeal to me . It may be my loss , but I can see in his distorted figures , his muddy color , his composition , his technique , neither the charm nor the strength that gives me sometimes pleasure , and always claims my interest , in the work of Van Gogh and Menne , of Maurice Denis and Matisse . Besides these artists , Seurat , Signac , and Cross are represented in pictures that push the technique of Claude Monet to its extreme in pointillisme ; Picasso , in one picture  --  a nude holding a basket of red flowers , in profile against a blue background that has dignity and grace and is almost academic in comparison to his other and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never find as successful in color as in blackand-white ; Odilon Redon , but not too characteristically ; and such less talked about men as Laprade , Vlaminck , Derain , Herbin . There are a few drawings , those by Matisse explaining what a masterly draughtsman he is . There are also a few bronzes by Matisse and Maillol , with a distinct character , but with a certain eccentricity in the forms , an undue emphasis in the modelling , that seem like deliberate exaggerations . The difficulty nowadays is that the most accomplished artist must doubt whether charm , refinement , - and beauty , whether the exquisite surface and splendid serenity , that were the old roads to success and fame , can assure his triumph under modern conditions and in modern exhibitions . This doubt may have possibly as much to do with some of the later developments in art as the synthesis and primitiveness and expression of personal emotion which the preface to the catalogue of the present exhibition ascribes to the Post-Impressionists . If they were less artists , and less well-trained artists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interesting painters many of them are . N. N. " One Hundred Masterpieces " is a book by the late John La Farge , which is shortly to be brought out by Doubleday , Page &; Company . The summer school of Harvard University announces a course on Turner and the landscape painting of his time , to be given in London next summer by Prof. Arthur Pope . This is an innovation in the - teaching of the subject of fine arts in Harvard University , and means an opportunity to study original works directly , instead , of by means of photographic reproductions . The course will begin July 5 and end August 15 , and will be open to women as well as men . - " Stories of the Spanish Artists , by Sir William Stirling7Maxwell , " selected and arr ranged by Luis Carreilo ( Duffield ) , is a handsomely made book containing eight color prints and twenty-four halftone cuts . It was a good idea to reduce the charming but bulky chronicle to more practicable compass , and the work of the shears and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stimulating introduction on Spanish painting in general , and there are lists , by no means complete and up to date , of the paintings of the fourteen artists treated in the text . Readers should be warned not to trust these pages too credulously for facts . In the life of El Greco , for example , much that was doubtful or inferential in Sir Stirling Maxwell 's time has become clear since Senor Coss:0 's standard biography . A little annotation on such material points would have increased the value of this welcome anthology . Sir Francis Piggott 's " Studies in the Decorative Art of Japan " ( Yokohama ? Kelly &; Walsh ) is unique in its field , being less cursory and fugitive in character and treatment than other attempts . The author , who is chief justice of Hongkong has given considerable time to a first-hand study of his subject , and has , besides , a no small degree of artistic insight . The seven chapters of the book deal with : The Art of Temples , The Decoration of Flat Surfaces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Decoration of the Japanese , The Use of the Circular Form , The Pakwa Diapers and the Key Borders . There are many apt and enlightening illustrations , finely executed , some in color and some in sepia . The impression created by lack of repetition and use of blank space in Japanese decorative art is carefully noted . The last chapter , on Pakwa Diapers and the Key Border , opposes the commonly accepted theory that these designs are a gift from Grnco-Buddhist art that came East by way of India at the time of Alexander 's conquests . Sir Francis Piggott shows that these forms are an evolution from a recognized religious symbol of the Orient , and that probably Greece borrowed from China . The fylfot , or rebated cross , is held to have been derived from the Pakwa , and may be regarded as representing the wheel of life . The style of the volume is itself artistic , and the book is , on the whole , pleasant reading A discovery of first-rate importance has been made in the neighborhood of Pompeii Last year excavations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remains of a magnificent mansion - of more than twenty rooms . The work was resumed this season , the volcanic dO'bris being removed to a sufficient depth to reveal the interior walls . These were found to be decorated with beautiful fresco paintings , many of which represent sculptural works , such as two Bacchantes in light drapery , Bacchus and Silenus attended by Satyrs , a priestess , and a dancing faun . Of great interest Is a series of about nine scenes , which may reproduce either a continuous relief composition , such as those which occur on the Ara Pacis , or be taken from separate groups by various artists One of the scenes shows a family of father , mother . and son , and an attendant bringing a pat-era to a priestess . Several - scenes represent initiations by flagellation of female hierophants into the Dionysiac mysteries ; the most striking is one of a woman , nude - to the Waist , stooping down with her head in the lap of a friend , ready to receive the stripes . Her companion places her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descending blow with terror in her face Of great beauty is also a woman dancing with castanets , turning her back to the spectator . Finally there is a scene of the initiated , seated on a tripod , and arranging her hair , with Cupid holding up a mirror for her . During some recent arohmological researches near Alexandria , in Egypt , an in teresting discovery was made . In the neighborhood of Kom-el-Chougafara a catacomb of Grnco-Roman period was brought to light . The tomb is divided into three floors , and runs deep into the rock The approach is by a winding staircase , which leads to a gallery , used probably in ceremonies in connection with the cult of the dead . From this , one passes to a triclinium , with tables and seats sculptured out of the rock . Three steps lead to the funeral chamber , elaborately carved with figures of the ancient gods of Egypt . The roof of this chamber is supported by a number of square columns , with lotus capitals . In a niche is placed a sarcophagus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medusa heads , with floral festoons . Though the decorations throughout are copied from the Pharaonic period , it is evident from their style that they are not earlier than the third or fourth century A. D.
