An Open Letter to the Rich THIS letter deals with the most important matter in the world . I warn you not to throw it away unread . Your mail , you answer , is crowded every day with letters from unknown correspondents . Long experience has taught you that it is best to ignore them . It saves your time . Often it saves your feelings . Who am I to demand an exception to your rule ? Let me begin by telling you who I am not . I am not a man who holds that your class is in a conspiracy against the rest of the race . I do not believe that you are bent on the one end of becoming masters , nor that you take satisfaction in beholding the rest of the community your slaves . A few of you do , perhaps , but a few of the rest of us do things just as bad . On the whole you are much like men and women the world over ; pretty kind-hearted , pretty thoughtless , pretty selfish , pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as you have : a chastening reflection . I write , then , not to rebuke or castigate you . I write to warn you and set you thinking . And now let me tell you who I am . I am a teacher in a small city in the West . I am married to the best woman in the world . We have two children , a boy and a girl , fast growing up . We " own " a small house , heavily mortgaged . I think I may , without vanity , call myself an effective teacher . Not exceptionally so , perhaps , but well above the average . Needless to say , I should not mention this were it not an essential link in what I have to say . My salary is , as teachers ' salaries go , a fair one . But it has already practically reached the limit which I can expect to receive . There is no disguising the fact that we have to watch our expenses pretty closely , though we have thus far prevented dispro-portionate concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diverting us from the worth-while things of life . Not that I never reflect on the arrangement of things whereby you have three motor-cars while I have none . But that aspect of the case never troubles me for long . The things that do hit a bit harder are our inability to travel , to indulge in an occasional dissipation in music or drama , to squander a little on dressing up the children , or to pay a competent instructor to find out just how much there is in certain artistic tendencies in our little girl . But there are compensations even in these privations . For when my wife and I do go to the theatre we are as happy as a pair of children on a picnic . And if we ever get a few days away from home just by ourselves , we arepositively as romantic as if we were on our honeymoon . But by this time you are asking what I am driving at and what in the world all this has to do with you . I will tell you ? and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not afford to have them . And you , though you do not know it , are to blame . There is my case in a nutshell . I wonder whether you know what it is to want more children . There was a time a few years ago when I used to come home at night and stumble on something soft on the stairway in the dark . " That infernal dog again , " I would say , and turning on the light would pick up a bit of stuffed brown felt with sprawling legs , dilapidated ears , and button eyes ? eyes with the oddest expression in the world . Well , my children are outgrowing the stage of toy dogs , and I do not like to contemplate that fact . I do not love them less as they grow older , but I want some more of them in the smaller sizes . I want a little fellow small enough to sit on my shoulder and pull my hair . I want to steal into an upper room in the dark , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a little fist into which to thrust my finger . I want a little lady at the breakfast table who when I feel a bit blue will suddenly out with a remark that would put to shame Aristophanes , Mark Twain , and Mr. Dooley rolled in one . I call these perfectly manly and reasonable desires . What is more , my wife wants the same things ? and many others . And finally , our two children need younger brothers and sisters , for I have come to believe that the only way to bring up two children right is to make them a small minority in the household . " Well , " you say , " if you want more children , why do n't you have them ? " If you were really candid with yourself you would admit that that is a superfluous , not to say a stupid , question . How can a sane man , who is now just living within his income , talk about increasing his family when his salary is being lowered every year ? Yes , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure , but in butter , milk , and eggs . The trouble is that to you the high cost of living is a mere abstraction . You have never realized it vividly and concretely , for the simple reason that it is years since you have looked at your own grocery bill . And the grocery bill is only the beginning of the difficulty . There is the problem of household help . My wife has brought up two children past babyhood and has done the work practically alone , but there are limits to her strength . There is the matter of insurance . A woman in this very neighborhood , left with five children all under nine and not a cent , brought that home forcibly to me only last month . There are doctors ' bills ? unavoidable with children in the house , however healthy . There is the fact that one more child , probably two , at any rate , would mean that my present house would be too small . There is the tremendous fact that children as they grow older grow costlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provision for their later education . Why ! if I were not afraid of trying your patience , I could go on specifying things which in the aggregate sometimes make it seem as if our whole social and economic fabric were deliberately devised to penalize the people who have children . Perhaps your comment at this point is that I insist on too high a standard of living . I do not think that remark comes with good taste from you , but if you wish to know , it is true ? I do refuse to have more children at the price of lowering the standard of our living , and I refuse , not for my own sake or even for my wife 's , but for the sake of the children we already have . And so the upshot of it all is that I shall probably never have more children . It will be a disappointment , but we human beings are born to encounter disappointment . If the matter ended there , I should not be writing you this letter . But the matter does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my two children . To begin with they are both good-looking ? if you ca n't see it , I have their grandmothers ' word for it . Their health is excellent . They are both , in the opinion of several teachers , above the average intellectually , the girl especially being quick as a flash . They are as full of explosive force as a cannon is of powder , and they are sufficiently stubborn to show that they have wills of their own . It is a fair presumption , I believe , that if I had more children they would share some of these same characteristics --  at any rate , their blood would go back through all four of their grandparents to stock that was in this country , in New England , before the year 1675 ; along two of those lines to the Mayflower . In the light of these facts , is it overbold to declare that the nation needs those children ? But I am not willing to rest my contention on my own case . Let me rest it on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been stating my own case correctly , I have at least been stating his . The country could use thousands of men such as Jones 's two little boys will , unless I miss my guess , grow up to be . In fact the country has simply got to have them . But Jones , in spite of the fact that there are few abler or harder-working men in our city , is in an economic box much like my own . I doubt if he ever has more children either . And what , you ask , have you to do with my financial difficulties and Jones 's ? Everything , my friend , everything ; and you know it . I hear you muttering something under your breath to the effect that if Jones and I want more children we can get busy and earn enough to support them . But the fact that you only mutter it under your breath proves that in your heart you know it is a lie . No , it 's altogether too late in the world 's history to perpetrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ability and enterprise . With that point settled , the facts of the situation are perfectly plain . The nation must have more of the right kind of babies . There are plenty of the right kind of parents who want the babies . There is plenty of wealth to support the babies . And the conclusion is : more of that wealth must be put into those parents ' hands . In other words , this problem is here , regardless of how big your income is or where it comes from . It has got to be settled , regardless , possibly , of how small your income becomes or where it goes to . The incomes must be arranged to suit the babies , not the babies to suit the incomes . Do not construe this , I beg of you , as a call for a higher birthrate . On the contrary it may mean a lower birthrate . It is merely a demand for a higher birthrate among the Joneses , a demand , in other words , for a higher rate of better births @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babies is , I willingly grant , quite the reverse of simple , but it is the most urgent problem that the nation , that humanity , now faces . You can help toward its solution in just one way : by standing up openly against the present method of the distribution of wealth and in favor of a method that will eradicate at least the grosser features of its injustice . How is it to be done , you ask ? A tremendously important question , but not the one that you and I are now discussing . Where there 's a will there 's a way . It is not with the way , but with the will , your will , that I am now concerned . Which means I must make you see certain things . First I must make you see , not vaguely but as vividly as if they were right before you , the children that might be but are not alive to-day : their bright faces , their happy voices , the rush and the glow of the life they enjoy and radiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as last year , you made that cross at the top of a certain column of your ballot ; when , as last month , you made that liberal subscription to the building fund of your club ; when , as last week , you assented to your wife 's social program for the winter ; when , as to-day and yesterday and the day before , you encouraged , however unconsciously , someone around you to imitate the paltry desires , to indulge the foolish whims , to intrench the false standards which your excessive income calls into being ? you denied , by every one of those acts , existence to a child . And when , as you have long been doing , you go further and help turn the stream of capital into channels that lead to the means of gratifying those tastes , yoU deny existence to whole families of children . No cold figures in your bank account are facts more certain . Because you have not understood these things , I have written , as I promised , in a spirit not of angerbut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and act . But if , having heard , you do not act , I shall put in more terrible and vivid imagery the true relation which you will then bear to the little hands that are knocking , the little voices that are calling , at the door of existence . I shall speak in another temper . I shall not mince my terms . I shall cast in your face the word that from the beginning has been allotted to the deliberate destroyer of life .
