txt WARNS OF NAVAL RASHNESS . Henry A. Wise Wood Deprecates Pressure for Attacks on Bases . In your issue of Aug. 21 ' there apwared the following dispatch from Paris : PARIS . Aug. ' ** authorities here strongly favor a more aggressive policy on the part of the British Navy in attacking German submarine bases . It is argued that if such an objective is worth a military offensive from ' Verdun to Flanders , costing hundreds of thousands of casualties , both the British and American ' fleet should go in fearlessly and destroy the U-boat nests in Belgium . This voices from France the suggestion , made here recently , that our navy , with or without that of Great Britain , be sent forthwith into the German 's mouth to . pure - ors teeth . To the civilian , rynenaps to the army man , it may seem a practicable undertaking at the present time to send an American naval expedition against Germany 's Belgian bases . So appeared the disastrous naval attack upon Turkey  --  in advance of the lesson it taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foothold here , and give rise to a newspaper campaign on behalf of Its acceptance . it would seem to be wise to point out promptly the following facts :  - -  First  --  Our ' navy at present is in the soft shell state . It is a nursery , not a fighting establishment . It is hard at work digesting great draughts of green men , who must he taught in a jiffy what it required the personnel of the navy years of hard study and practice to learn . A naval fight is a sea game , in which an untrained and unhardened team can no more stand up against professionals of long experience than could a team picked from the bleachers stop the Giants . To put a schooling navy up against the hardest naval job known ? that of reducing a fortified land position  --  could result in nothing but a useless slaughter of the innocents , the destruction of unreplaceable equipment of vast international importance , and an increase of Germany 's relative sea strength equal to our losses . Second  --  Such an undertaking requires especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , and suitable air and land supports , the project would be an exhibition of madness . The new instruments required ara : ; not yet at hand , nor is the navy 's aerial arm even begun upon such a scale as would enable it to administer to the Belgian bases , by means of a swarm of seaplanes , a sufficient anaesthesia to permit the fleet to engage in a successful operation . Third  --  A navy is the world 's most intricate fighting machine . Those only understand it who from boyhood have swum in and grown up with its kaleidoscopic problems ; no others are competent to say how , or where , or when , precisely , it should be used . No civilian , nor even the wisest Secretary who ever has sat in the navy 's chair , ever vas or is competent to mold its strategy , or to guide its tactics . As safely might the boy who climbs into the empty cab of a locomotive handle the levers he finds before him . Such a boy was Churchill at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should give the navy its head , and keep the civilian 's hand out of its professional problems . We should feed it lavishly with men , new equipment , and supplies , and furnish it at price with an enormous  --  I use the word advisedly  --  aerial counterpart of itself . Its strategy and tactics we should leave exclusively in professional hands . But at all times we should insist upon knowing that its plans are its own , and have been made by its ablest minds . Having faithfully done these things , then , and then only , shall we be entitled to expect of our navy achievements commensurate with its glorious traditions . That they shall be forthcoming not an American doubts . HENRY A. WISE WOOD . New York . Aug. 30. 1017 . Save the Birds That Save Crops . So the Editor of The New York Times : To the many cogent arguments of commonsense economics and of elementary humanity ( too familiar by this time , I hope , to need repetition hers ) there is now added a new argument  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . America , in these war days , must harvest unprecedented crops ; therefore the crops ' worst enemies , the In , Act scourges , must be kept in check as never before . To this end there Is but one sure means . Food products are being conserved , Indeed . in their later stages , but plain logic requires that they be conserved first at their source . Just such conservation is accomplished for us , year In , year out , , by the tireless industry of the insect-eating birds , best of all conservators of food ; therefore should the birds themselves be the first of all to be conserved . Despite these facts , the high cost of living , working against reason , is now tempting the poor  --  especially certain foreigners  --  to a wholesale slaughter of birds for food . This temptation , very naturally , will grow as the Autumn advances , and as myriads of young birds , in various stages of Inability to care for themselves , and of southbound migrants . old and ycung , swarm over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation  --  too obvious to need explanation  --  must be met at once . Learn the game laws thoroughly . Obey them conscientiously . See to it that Others obey them . Report all violations to the proper authorities . Thus may you help to make these laws a. power for great good . Add to this  --  and it can not be too much emphasized  --  a systematic , year-round administration of justice to the birds ' most mortal enemy . Every cat not really needed as a ratter and mouser , or counted as a member of the family , should be promptly and mercifully put to death , on sight . Every cat allowed to live must be kept Indoors all night , well fed always , ( and especially just Before going out. ) prevented from roaming at will , and , In general . carefully trained to be a law-abiding eitixen . One cat . in its lifetime , may kill several hundred birds ; one bird may kill many hundred thousand insects . Save the birds ! R. E. ROBBINS . Deputy Fish and Game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
