 | THESE are super-extraordinary times , so crowded with epochal events that the greatest mining boom the world has ever seen , a boom alongside of which the " days of forty-nine , " the mad whirl around the Comstock lode , the Alaska and the Goldfield excitement were mere pigmies , has grown up , filled the Far Western horizon to the zenith , and begun to recede again without making an impression upon public consciousness . Yet this boom , this superlative activity of the American metal mines , was the foundation of the ammunition business , the source that supplied the zinc , lead , quicksilver , tungsten without which the Allies could never have waged a successful war against the Central Powers . And the byproducts of this superlative boom , the torrent of dividends , the tales of sudden fortune , the sky-rocketing of mining shares , in their quantity and volume surpass all similar episodes in the history of American metalmining . AMERICAN ZINC CONTROLS THE WORLD 'S MARKET It began with zinc , the metal whose producers have consistently asked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Spelter ? the trade name for zinc ? was on the down-grade , with stocks going up and prices declining , for two years before the war . In July , 1914 , the price dropped to 4.75 cents a pound , the lowest since 1908 . When the war disorganized commerce and industry the world over , zinc slumped still farther . In common with all American metal mines , the zinc producers curtailed operations when the industries of peace reduced their output . During the dark winter of 1914-15 shares of zinc , copper , lead , and silver mines were on the bargain table , with few buyers . The war demand for metals had not yet begun . Few men realized the unprecedented quantities of metal required by modern war . Yet the zinc producers should have known . They were warned . American zinc has never been exported in large quantities . In January , 1914 , only 230 tons were shipped abroad , and the average for the succeeding five months fell below this figure . In September of the first war year the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October 10,000 tons went to Europe , yet the price continued to decline . The analytic faculties of the American zinc producers seemed to be paralyzed by the catastrophe . They had the world 's spelter business in the hollow of their hand and did not know it . There is no lack of zinc ore in Europe ; Germany , Austria , Belgium , Italy , Spain , Russia , northern France , all have it ; Australia has great zinc mines ; deposits have been newly opened in Burma and Siberia , but the concentrates of all these mines are reduced in German-controlled smelters located in Germany and Belgium . When the war broke out , Great Britain found herself with an abundant supply of zinc ore and wholly insufficient plants to smelt more than a fraction of it . Thus the United States in a twinkling became the sole source of metallic zinc for all the warring world except the Central Powers . And zinc constitutes onethird of the brass indispensable in the manufacture of ammunition . Early in 1915 the American zinc producers , focusing their eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix the price of spelter had passed from Frankfort to Missouri . So they took a deep , joyful breath and proceeded to fix the price . They sent zinc up a cent , two cents , even three cents at a time . It leaped from five cents in January to twenty-seven cents in June , closing the year 1915 at seventeen cents a pound . In September of the present year it was still bringing nine cents a pound , twice the average price of the last fifteen years nothwithstanding a production almost double that of 1913 . Never before had the zinc districts of Missouri , Oklahoma , of New Jersey and the Far West experienced greater prosperity ? and probably they will never again see a period like it . Scores of new mines were  | opened , especially in the Joplin district ; old mines unable to operate when zinc brought only five cents a pound started up again . Zinc ore that was dumped , zinc tailings , and the leanest of zinc deposits were worked up . And the established zinc producers fairly spouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid no dividends on its share capital of $2,700,000 ; since then this one mine has disbursed over $40,000,000 to its stockholders . During the first six months of 1916 it was producing zinc at the rate of 180,000,000 pounds a year , with a profit of a million a month . The InterstateCallahan , an Idaho zinc producer , saw its shares slump to 50 cents a few years ago . In the year preceding the outbreak of the war operations showed a deficit . Since April , 1915 , $4,000,000 have been paid out in dividends and the shares climbed to $27 . The New Jersey Zinc Company in eighteen months declared dividends in excess of $15 , - 000,000 and the Caledonia produced similar results . A PROBLEMATIC FUTURE FOR THE INDUSTRY Yet there is a fly in the zinc ointment . Great Britain by special legislation has annulled the contracts which would have compelled the Australian producers to resume delivery of their zinc concentrates to the German smelters after the war , thus breaking a well-settled principle of international law in order to build up a British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allies are rapidly becoming independent of American zinc as their new smelters are blown in . But in the meantime the capacity of the American zinc smelters has been almost doubled . And the German and Belgian smelters are still ready for business . A child can figure out that a hard road with many bumps lies ahead of the American zinc industry . World competition in the zinc trade will be fiercer than ever when peace comes , so fierce that only those American properties which have used a part of their war profits to cut production costs to the bone can face the future with equanimity . ASSURED PROSPERITY FOR COPPER PRODUCERS Copper is in an entirely different position . Except for a temporary disturbance due to the necessity of readjusting the world 's entire industrial structure when peace comes , the copper interests do not expect a sharp or prolonged depression . Supplying 60 per cent . of the world 's production , the United States fears no competitor in the copper market . Its best customer , Germany , the market that formerly absorbed more than one-third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throes of a copper famine . It has used up its stock of the red metal and has even confiscated immense quantities of manufactured copper to meet the pressing military demands . Germany 's national cupboard is bare of copper , but Germany 's remarkable electrical industry will resume business when peace comes . Stocks of raw and manufactured copper must be replaced in Germany the moment the ocean lanes are reopened , and the impending German demand , plus domestic consumption , will almost suffice to keep the American mines busy . The Allied countries , though , are not very much better supplied with copper than their opponents . Owing to the unprecedented price of the red metal and the excessive ocean freights , the British , French , and Italian industries have almost used up their accumulated copper stocks and are now living from hand to mouth , their purchases keeping barely . a month ahead of current requirements . They likewise must stock up to meet the reconstruction needs . And since almost the same situation exists in the American copperconsuming industries , the producers are justified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this prosperity will fall far short of the present delirious war profits . In warfare copper and its alloys are almost indispensable . Even the pigmy military establishment of the United States in peace times requires 20,000,000 pounds of copper per annum . Hostilities , of course , immediately send copper consumption skyward . And when warfare is conducted on the present European scale , the belligerent copper appetite turns into a ravenous craving . Yet the copper industry in the fall of 1914 did not foresee the full extent of the impending military demand . The copper producers refused to believe that an entire continent would organize itself for the sole pursuit of scientific slaughter . They expected a short , sharp war attended by complete derangement of the normal industrial activities , and upon this premise they based their actions . When copper slumped from 13 to 11 cents a pound , mines and smelters curtailed their production 40 per cent . and prayed for a speedy peace . Instead they received a long war and a copper boom that dwarfs all the famous gold stampedes in mining history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of producing a pound of copper in 1914 was 8.62 cents . In December , 1914 , the average New York selling price was 12.75 cents a pound ; a year later the price had risen to 20.67 cents . From December 15 , 1915 , the price went up a cent a week for six consecutive weeks . In May of this year it reached 29 cents and in August it still hovered around 25 cents a pound , even though copper was flying out of the ground at a rate considered impossible of attainment only a few years ago . The true proportions of the great copper boom are graphically shown in the following table giving the quantity and value of the American copper production in round figures for a series of years : Production Year in pounds Value 1895 380,000,000 $40,000,000 1900 606,000,000 98,000,000 1905 888,000,000 137,000,000 1910 1,080,000,000 137,000,000 1913 1,224,000,000 189,000,000 1914 1,150,000,000 152,000,000 1915 1,388,000,000 242,000,000 In 1916 the State of Arizona promises to produce 600,000,000 pounds of copper , a quantity equal to the total production of the United States in 1900 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property , is this year producing 185,000,000 pounds , an increase of 70,000,000 over its 1914 output and a larger yield than the aggregate production of all the mines in Michigan during 1914 . From Alaska to Chile the flood of red metal pouring forth in answer to the call of extraordinary prices has become broad and deep enough to drown the anxious fear of a potential copper shortage . The copper mines of the United States , of North and South America , have demonstrated that their yield will be equal to the rising demand for many years to come . So far as copper is concerned , the electrization of the world may proceed apace . LEAD HAS A PART IN THE GENERAL ADVANCE Lead has not been as spectacular in its behavior as zinc and copper , but in its quiet , steady way it has shared in the metal prosperity that grew out of Europe 's blood . The lead mines of Missouri , Idaho , Colorado , and Utah were paying excellent dividends when the metal brought 41/2 cents . The war demand has lifted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $30 a ton , and the output has grown by 100,000 tons . The lead districts are watching the European holocaust with equanimity , especially since silver , byproduct of the Far Western lead ores , rose from 49 cents an ounce , its low point , to 68 cents early in September . EVEN QUICKSILVER SHARES IN THE UPWARD MOVEMENT The quicksilver mines of California were in a state of coma before the war . The margin between the selling price of $37.50 per flask of 75 pounds and the cost of production was so small that the larger properties were operated merely to conserve the investment . As England immediately placed an embargo on quicksilver , the American price doubled in August , 1914 , though the real quicksilver boom did not begin until nearly a year and a half later when , under the stimulus of the enormous American demand , the price soared to $300 a flask , even though scores of old and new mines were adding to the output . Unfortunately the British Government , to help American ammunition firms , lifted a corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cross the Atlantic , bringing the California price down- to $100 a flask in a few weeks . Still , quicksilver has been very profitable , and the output , both in quantity and value , is establishing new high records . TUNGSTEN 'S SOARING PRICE Tungsten gives the high-speed tool steel its hardness and enables the steel to retain its temper in great heat . While the world 's machine shops were working under normal peace conditions , ore containing 60 per cent . of tungstic acid sold at $6.50 per unit of twenty pounds . Boulder County , Colorado , and San Bernardino County , California , supplied the bulk of the American output . When machine shops in all the world began turning out rifles , shells , and cannon , the demand for high-speed tool steel rose so rapidly that tungsten early in 1916 soared to $130 per unit . This spectacular performance was of short duration , but while it lasted the West became tungsten-mad . In a dozen States beyond the Rockies tungsten deposits were found , even Alaska contributing to the rising output @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulated profits of $50 and $100 a day , selling their ore to the buyers of the tool-steel makers who scoured the mountains and deserts for the precious alloy material .
