T wish to enter a protest against the recent policy of the Metropolitan Opera House management as unwise and unjust to old subscribers . I hate subscribed to the same seats as far back as the M. Gray management ; without my consent I was some years ago instructed by the management to renew my subscription through agents , the circular stating that no change in price would obtain . &c,; Although not understanding t he object of turning seats already sold to an agent . I followed instructions on the same terms until this year . when I am notified by the agents that to meet their commission an advance of 20 per cent . would he charged . Why a com-mission ? The opera management will certainly lose many subscribers if it insists on its present scheme . For my part I have decided to give up my subscription rather than submit to a patent injustice , and I hone ? this will he read by many old subscribers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that abuse . A VERY OLD SUBSCRIBER .
