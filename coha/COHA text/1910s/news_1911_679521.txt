txt A new form of college le described in a recent number of The Independent by Prof. HARRY A. Cusm7 of the Columbia Law School . It is based on an address issued by the class of 1885 in Amherst College through a committee consisting of E. P. Prtzxrion , Esq. , ' of this city , President LANCABTEJR of Olivet College , and Dr. THAYER , Head Master of St. Mark 's School , all names entitled to respect . We shall not now discuss the general nature of the college course recommended , save to remark that it seeks through culture rather than preparation for any special vocation . What interests us particularly is the means proposed to make the college potent in a high kind of utility for those who are admitted to It . For this purpose it is proposed that the number of students be strictly limited ; that only the most promising among applicants be selected ; that the high standard set ? at entrance be rigidly maintained , and that the resources of the college be devoted , not to buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ securing enough pay to professors to get the very best in their several lines . In other words , the college Is to be organized to give the best culture by the best teachers to- young men best adapted to take it and most eager and efficient in pursuit of it . This , we believe , is in the right line . It Is by no means . the model for all colleges , and it is not intended to fill the place of the universities which deserve the name . Much less is it intended to replace professional or technical schools , or the increasing number of institutions that aim to fit young men for callings other than professional . But it would benefit a certain class , numerous when we take our whole population into account , who seek through hard work to attain a really thorough training In the art of thinking and of study , ? which is , essentially , education. ? For this class at present the provision in the United States is pitifully inadequate . It is in a way less than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confined t'o those who were seeking to enter one of the three professions then recognized . For these general culture in a limited course was considered sufficient . and ? -. usually proyed So . ... BILL the saying : cOndition in the . relativelY modest institutions /adore ? the civil ? war Waif ; that nearly all the students " went . through college " at substantial cost and sacrifice to themselves and their families , and wore ' disposed to work hard to make the most of what was a real privilege . The Amherst Committee seek to secure this same spirit and to make the molt of it . They would sift out the lazy , the dull , the ' incapable , and give to those really able and determined to take it careful and thorough training In such general culture as can be had in four years . They would establish a working college for working students , and for Such an institution there is a definite and strong demand                 @ @ @ @
