BUT on the 25th of April I wanted to live . As I was sitting on my bed just eating my bread with a bit of salt to it , I had a letter from my wife begging for news from me and telling that she got news from the War Office on the 30th March telling her that I WILS a prisoner of war in Germany . I may say that it cased my mind it great deal to know she knew where I was . I was able to write back and tell her that I was all right , etc. , as I was feeling a lot bet ter then . The sun was beginning to have its effect on me . I used to he out of the room as much as possible when the sun was shining . On the Ohm h April I had an order for 2s. lid. , but I could not spend it at the time , as they would not give its the money . We had to put 402 THE DELIVERANCE FROM Wirl'ENBERG down for some groceries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar . 1 lb. of margarine , and I jar of syrup . I was about . a month before I got them . On the 1st May , I had 34 packets of Woodbine cigarettes come from the Chums Association of my town Worksop ) which were a godsend to Inc . I had not had a sniolw since I came out of hospital , but I was not long before I had one of them on the go . It was the first real smoke since I was captured , and I felt quite drunk after the first cigarette , and not only ate but a few of the boys as well . I was beginning to feel new life then . On the 7t11 of May we were allowed to send a post-card home for the first . time since the fidlure of the 1st of January one . So I wrote home again asking my wife to send me a few things to eat , and not forget Ling to mention is smoke . I did not . build any high hopes this time of them going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I found out later that mine had got through . A few days later we were all removed into No. 8 compound , when I think some of the sentries went mad for the lust of killing some one . It was on the evening of the 20th of May that a Frenchman was going to hospital inside the wire enclosure , but not in the compound , and Ile stopped to talk to one of his comrades through the wires , and whilst talking he was shot through the back by one of the sentries not twenty yards away . There the poor fellow fell and died . No one was allowed to go out to his aid under penalty of being served the same , not for a long time after . Then the alarm went , and we had to get back to our rooms . Then there was some more shooting , so we had to keep low for a while . I saw seven carried by on tables and I heard afterward that three were dead and the remainder wounded , and that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room door . All those poor fellows were shot . for practically nothing . No reason whatsoever . The next . day they had us all fall in at the bottom of the compounds . They then turned the guns towards us , and had a lot of soldiers lining the ditches around the camp , just t he same as if they were going to attack the camp and kill the lot of us . After they had had us like that for about half an hour , the whistle blew , and I may say there was a race for the rooms then . I do not . know what . t heir idea was , but if it were to let . us see what they could do in case anything went wrong in camp , there was no need for that demonstration , as nothing ever happened 1.0 show the slightest cause whilst I was in that camp . And I was there front the 20th December , 1914 , to the time of leaving for Switzerland On the 25tH May , 1 9 16 . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were punished by being tied up to the posts in the hot sun , and the ropes were drawn so tight t he poor fellow could scarcely breathe and some of than would go blue in the face . Any punishment that , they could think of was not , had enough for them to inflict On a man , such as making them stand on their toes with their hand on their hips for an hour or more , and sonic balanced on their toes with knees bent and a piece of wood to represent a rifle held out a t. arm 's length . If there is any one who reads this and can not imagine what it is like , just try it for an hour with an empty stomach . And they were not . allowed any soup . Then the Germans would laugh and jeer at them . In all my experience , they are the cruelest , race of people I ever came across . 1 thank God to-day that I and an Englishman . About the end of May I received a post-card from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through some firm there ( I forget the name and // place ) to see if they could get news of inc and if I were allowed to write . So Illy flag fell again , as I thought they could not have sent the last card , so I did not know what to do . I know I haled the Germans more than ever , for it is a cruel thing to be kept in suspense for such a long time . But imagine my joy on the 1 Oth June when I received a post-card from my wife telling me that she had received my card dated 7tlr May and that she sent a box of foodstuff oft on the 27111 , the same day she got my card . I felt like forgiving the Germans all they had done to me , so I was left wondering if I would get the box , and what a feed I should have when it came . I could not sleep many a night for thinking about it , and so on the ' 28 th June the welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one from Illy wife and the other from her dear mother , who I am proud to say has been the best friend to toy wife and children and also myself in our time of anxiety and trouble . Well , I was not long in having the hoses open to see the good things inside , and when I saw the currant loaves , I had a good fill . It was a wonder that I did not make myself bad , for I ate a whole two-pound loaf and some cheese straight off , as I felt as if I could not leave it alone . Then I had a good smoke . After that I felt very comfortable , more than ever since I was taken Out of the trenches . I was happy for a week . We were now allowed to write a post-card every Saturday , so with that I was able to keep in communication with home and that was worth a lot to me , as we had been practically cut off from the world without , any news at all . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to my surprise it was it large fruit-cake . I should think it were about eight pounds , and one of the finest cakes that ever came into that camp , and I had the great pleasure of having two of I hem from my own town , Worksop ; but I do not even know now who sent them . But . I hope to have the pleasure of thanking them when I get home again . Then I went another month without receiving any more . But the parcels began to come in met t y frequent by then , as the people in England began to get to know where their boys were . I had another post-card from in.v- wife , telling me that she was sending me a parcel of food every week . But I never got it lot of them . I went almost two months without receiving one of her weekly parcels , so I wrote and told her not to send any more , as were not getting them . Then the very next week they started corning and they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the card , up to the time of my coming away , as she would insist on sending me one whether I got them or not . I had four parcels from Lady Beau-clerk 's Fund , but they stopped for about three months . After that I received five more from her , and I also had five from the Lancashire Regiments war funds , also a complete outfit of clothing from them , which I was wanting very badly , as my old khaki was getting the worse for wear . Some of the tinned stuff would reach us in a very bad state . The Germans would stab with their bayonets tills of syrup , milk , salmon , and corned beef . Anything that , would go bad or waste they would stab ; even the tea , sugar , coffee , cocoa , soap , and tobacco would be all mixed up together , and then the milk and syrup would run out of the tills where they had stabbed them , and all over the remainder of I be stuff . But after a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show that the damaged ones we used to get had been damaged wilfully . July passed without anything of importance to my knowledge . About the th August we had a severe shock . I will endeavor to I ell the story ; LS best I can . I was laid on my bed about 8 P.M. when one of the boys shouted across to me and asked me if I knew what , the light was which were shining on the other side of t he room , I looked across , but could only see the elect ric light shining through t he window from outside , so I told him that it was only the lamp from outside . Then he said , Not that one ; have a look through the window . ' So I did . Than I saw what he meant. , for I could see a big red glare over the other side of t he camp . I told him t here must be a big fire and then 1 ran out side to get a bet ter view of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shouted for them to conic and have a look , but I had no sooner shout eel when bang ! went a terrific report which shook the whole camp . There were six steps to go up into our room . I do not know how I got on to the top one , but that was where I found myself . Then I turned round to have a look at what damage it , had done , but . all I could see was a lot of men running as fast as they could . Some were shouting , " I ' he cl ? d Germans are blowing the camp up ! ' Then I saw one man dressed in white fall clown , and than there were about twenty more fell over him . I could not help but laugh , although my heart was beat Mg a great . deal faster than its normal state ; and whilst they were clown another bang wen t. off which made them shout worse than ever . There were English , French , Russians , and Belgians a.11 on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there I saw a lot of men crawling underneath the bungalows out of harm 's way . Ilut . I thought they would be well away if the bungalows were to fall on top of them , as t he reports shook a great deal and a great many of the windows went with the first report . When I went back into my room , I could not help laughing when I saw the Russians bowing and making signs across their bodies . Some were right underneath their mattresses , and some with a blanket over their heads , and some:hiding behind the table-top , where I had put , it along the door to keep t he draught . oft ' me in the night , as I slept against t he door . We then heard that . the ammunition factory had blown up . II Shortly after the explosion the Germans cattle back into the camp again , as the typhus had practically disappeared . But we could have very well clone without them , as we had had enough of them when they were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had from them . When they came in , they were just as wild as ever . We hardly dared look round but one of them would be snarling at us . ' Theo they started to send two Germans through the rooms , one with a dog and the other with a rifle and fixed bayonet . And , instead of ! cooping the clog close to him , he would allow it the whole length of the leash , so as to give it plenty of room to spring on the man nearest to it , which happened very often and the men 's clothes were torn by them . They would sometimes pounce into the room , which was practically dark with the exception of one stable lamp to light the whole room up . We would be talking amongst ourselves under this hoop , and not notice them till they were on us ; then the dog would bark and spring at the one nearest to it , when there would be a scamper to the sides of the room . They would then have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose and several men were severely bit by them . I remember one corporal who used to come round with a clog . Ile used to threat en to strike its because we would not stand THE DELIVERANCE o attention while he passed through the room , swelling his chest as if he was the Kaiser himself . But we soon qnt his little swank stopped , as one of our sergeants reported him to the captain of our compound . After the Germans had been back a few weeks , we were marched once a week to the bath-house and we would take everything belonging to us . While We were having our bath our clothes ; Ind blankets would be fumigated , Which operation would last about tweny minutes after we got inside the bath . There would be from 10 to 50 go in at a time . The worst part about it was the waiting outside in the cold and sometimes in the rain . I have seen the time when we have had to wait from 8 A.M. to 11 A.M. before we could get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 A.M. till soup-thne , then we had to go back and come again after soup . There was one German who would come and strike us chaps who had only got one good hand , because we could not dress and undress as quick as the other men . Ile was a regular terror for striking us . But by good chance an American reporter came along , and do n't forget , we told him everything : the only decent man that ever came into camp that we could tell our troubles to , and he listened to us with a good will . When he was talking to one of our fellows the German stall ' officers came close up to him , to listen to what they were talking about , but lie soon asked them to stand back , which they did with a few black looks . The camp commandant was in a fine rage that day . I am glad to say that the reporter 's coming did a lot of good for us , as things began to improve after the reports had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soup was something horrible . The Russians , who were practically starving , could not // drink it . Many a time it used lo he carried to the latrine and emptied down there . Even their own pigs sometimes refused to eat it . I had from good authority that three pigs died and that they were cleaned and sent to the cookhouse to be boiled up for the camp . So we got the hint not to have any soup for two or three days . A short time after the reporter had been , a captain of the RA.AI.C . Was struck by a German ; and if they will strike a captain-doctor what would they not do to us ? But after that there was very little striking . It was more like the good old English style ? take his name and get punished accordingly . I am pleased to say that I was never punished in that way for misbehavior , as I had had enough punishment at t he beginning for being an Englishman . But I once had a very narrow escape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . of bed . Ile had it shambok in his hand , so he made a rush at a couple of our men , when of course a laugh went round , and a young chap who was lying next to me ( Enoch Brook ) had a laugh like a donkey bellowing . Then he let go , the thought that it was me making fun at him , so he took my name . But I was very lucky and did not hear anything more about it , for 1 did not want tying up to the post ; I had seen enough of the other poor fellows . Early in September they came round asking what trade we were used to in England . I told him that I was a butcher . We had heard a whiff that they wanted some men for the mines . I tun also used to working in a mine , but I did not tell them so . So a lot of Joiners changed their trade to hawkers , chimney-sweeps , clerks , and beer-testers.They came for the butchers first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hand being useless . They were not long before they had a lot of men going out to work on farms and in factories . After they had sent . a lot of men away , they made our compound into a convalescent place and moved all that were fit into other compounds , and all t hose that were unfit into ours , and then every nationality were put in I heir own rooms , which was a lot better for us . So we used to pass the time away walking about till we were tired , and then AVCIlt in and had a game of cards which were made out of cigarette packets until we got . some from England . On Saturday nights we used to have a concert in our room and the boys l'ront the other rooms used to come and spend a pleasant night once a week . We had violins , and very good ones they were . They were made out of the parcel-boxes , and if they had been varnished , you could not tell if t hey had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made so perfect bout in shape and he splendid music they could get out of them . These were made by some of the Russians . I never saw such a handy lot of men ; they could make anything . Before I left camp , we could get anything from a button to an aeroplane , of course toy ones , all made by these Russians . As time went on things began to be a bit pleasanter for us , as the Germans were getting quite tame . They began to see what the English were like and that they could not make them downhearted , as we were always either singing or whistling . And when we got some clothes and boots , we all would turn out with polished hoots and buttons . It was quite common to see some of us as clean and as smart as if they were walking out with their best girl in England . I am sure it impressed the Germans . We all looked a lot smarter and cleaner than the Germans outside . We looked haggard and worn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our place . We would sometimes pull their legs . About six of us would get together and pretend that we could see an aeroplane ; and after they had been straining their necks for a while , looking for something that was not there , we would have a good laugh at them and shout Englander . ' There were all sizes and shapes , boys and ( ) Id men . I remember one old mail with a gray beard who could hardly walk , as he was ruptured very bad , but he had to do his sentry-go just the same as the young ones . When we used to go and draw the parcels , about 30 or 40 men carrying 4 and 5 parcels a man , they would start teasing the sentries , and saying to them , ' England kaput , nix packets , ' at the same time dangling the parcels they were carrying in front of them . Then the sentries would say , England nix kaput , plenty packets . ' But I began to think at times that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time without getting any . I had live from the end of October to Christmas eve . But I did not go short , as the boys who were getting a lot used to give me some of theirs . On Christmas eve we all were very busy . A very great difference from the Christmas eve before , unpacking our parcels and putting the good things into a box we kept on purpose to put on the shelf . The other chaps had got all their stuff on the shelf . Then I asked one of them to lift mine on for me , but he had no sooner put it on when the shelf broke in the middle and the whole lot came clown with a crash . Of course they all blamed my box , as it . had been practically empty for a long time . I would not have minded , only I could not find my tobacco after we had cleared all up again . I had to fall back on the boys for a smoke . We then had a few songs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we were getting all sorts of little games out from // home by then . Then we all got clown to sleep and dream of the plum puddings we were going to enjoy the next clay . ( Thristmas day . We were all up in good t ime the next morning and wished one another a merry Christmas , and I may say that we enjoyed ourselves immensely . Some of the boys managed to get a drop of rum , and of course that livened things up a bit . My friend Lew invited me to have my dinner with them in their room . And we had a grand feast , almost just the same as if we were at home . We had cardboard plates and plenty of food to put on ! hem this time : tinned tongue , beef , sausages , and steaming-hot plum puddings , finished off in style with chocolates , nuts , dried fruits , cigars , cigar-et t es , and tobacco . Then we had a few good old Christmas carols . Every one of u9 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when we were starving and hungry on our way to Wittenberg . The boys that had got the rum were in a merry mood . I thought they would never stop singing . But I am pleased to say that everything passed off very well . At last the clay came to an end , and every one of us stood up and sang Britannia rules the waves , ' and finished with ' God Save the King . " 1Then to bed we went , after the best clay we had had since we were taken prisoners . I may say that it was the best clay I had in Germany , except one , and that was the day I left , for that one beat them all . On New Year eve we had another good feast , and we sang the good old carols with a better heart than we did the year before , as we had some good old English packing inside us , instead of the German wind and water . III New Year , 1916 , brought us better prospects than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sonic of us were inspected by a German doctor to he exchanged for England . Some of us passed , I for one . Put as time went on and we heard nothing More about it , we gave it up as a bad job . About six or seven weeks later , an order came that those men that had passed the doctor before were to go to hospital to be examined again , so our hearts began to flutter . But not for long this time , as we were inspected by the Iron Cross hero this time , the one that came padded up when the typhus was on the go . Do only passed one 111 ; 111 out of thirty , and t hat poor fellow is still in Germany , They would not . even let him come to Suit zerland wit h us . This man , Private Davis of the King 's Own Yorkshire Light . Infantry , after being passed for England , was sent to work . Ile Was one of a party of thirty men who were sent out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' as some of them had bad legs , some with bad arms , and one man with one eye . They looked more like being exchanged for England than going out to work . The Germans wanted them to work on Sumlays , but they had not been used to it , so they refused . They were then sent back to Wit tenberg and put in a punishment compound ( No. 3 compound ) . They had to do all fatigues in camp and they were not . allowed to receive their parcels and letters from home , but they were allowed to write . They had been like that a long time before I came away . They ( the Germans ) have sent bet ter men to Switzerland than several of this unlucky working part y . A few weeks later news came that there was going to be an inspection of t he sick and wounded to go to Switzerland . So every one of us had our worst look or limp on that day . After the inpection we all were on tenter-hooks WO1ld ening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other would be asking , ' What did he say to you ? " Do you think he passed any ? ' and t hen would say , ' I hope . I have passed . ' But none of us knew , so of course we were unsettled for a week or two , expecting to hear Who had passed and who had not . But nothing came , so we stopped packing of our bits of things , as we hardly dared look at our bags , but some one would shout , When are you going ? ' or Mat train are you going to catch ? ' Just as we had given it up again , we had another inspect ion , but the stone thing happened again ; then another , and so on until we had ten inspections altogether before Ihey let us go . We had been disappointed so many times that we thought they were pulling our legs , so we lost all faith in them and fell into our normal state of camp-life again , at the same time wishing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I used to pass 1111111y a day away reading . I have read more books whilst in that camp than I read in all my life before . When I could get hold of one of Nat Gould 's I was happy , as there were always a lot of excitement in them . The Germans had now begun to let us make little fires in the compound to boil water for our tea and warm some of our tinned meat . up . Before then it was very difficult to make anything , because if you had a fire , once upon a time , a lump of lead would come whizzing past your head ; but they got very kind and had a boiler brought in the COMpOttlid , so we used to buy hot water from the Russians at two pfennigs bowl full . Sometimes we would get it boiling and other tittles nearly cold . Then it used to spoil our tea and there would be a bit of arguing with the Russian ; but it was all useless talk , as he would not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as wise when he talked to us , so we had to make the best of a bad job . We used to get issued a raw herring twice a week , but I could not go mine raw . A good many of them could , especially the Russians . They would go mad for them and they did not waste any either , for they would eat the head and inside as well and then look round for the heads that our fellows threw away . But of course they were starving and not getting any Packets the same as we were , so there is an excuse for them . I know 1 would have done the same before our parcels started coming . I am sure a cat , never mind a raw herring , would have been very acceptable at one time ; but there were neither to be had at that time for me to see what they were like . I used to give my herring and also the German bread , when I had some English bread , to a Russian , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , as was very bad at washing clothes with one good hand . But I have managed to wash them many a time and then get a chum to wring them out for me . We used the tin biscuit boxes for a cooking range . We cut a hole in one side , just large enough for our can to rest on the edge . The boys would be very busy from 7 to 8 A.M. , 11 A.M. to 1 P.M. , cooking their food and making tea . We used to have tea or cocoa to every meal . Some of the boys that had no fire would hang round until there was one finished with . It used to be the old cry , ' After you with the fire , mat e , ' just the same as when we were smoking a cigarette in the hard times ? ' Anybody after you , mate ? ' Our fuel would consist of the boxes our food used to come in . Sometimes we could buy a box from the canteen for half a mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Camp-life was getting up to perfection now , as the Germans were more friendly towards us , and being able to cook our own food made everything a lot easier to bear . About the middle of April we had wooden beds conic in our room . Some of the camp had I hem before us , as they all were made in the camp by some of the prisoners and they were issued out as they finished them , o we were able to sleep off the floor for I he first time and able to keep our blankets a lot cleaner , as they used to get very dirty with always being on the floor . Being more comfortable than we rid been for a long time , we forgot all about , the inspections for Switzerland . I sett led down to my reading and wondering how much longer the war was doing to last , and how long I had to re-111R111 behind the barbed wire . IV On the afternoon of the 24th May , I lay on my bed reading . I was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a German sergeant calling my name . I had been so interested in my book that I did not take any notice of him before , but when I heard my own name shouted , I was all cars then , and I was not long in making inquiries to see what he wanted . I will never forget t he joy I felt when he told inc to fall in , as I was going to Switzerland , so I never finished the last few lines of the book . I was so excited I forgot all about . the Black Tulip . After we all had fell in , he gave us instructions as to what we were to take with us , such as correspondence , as we would be searched at Konstanz , and if they found anything about us , we would be sent back to Wittenberg again . Then he told its to pack our things up at once , as we had to go into No. 6 compound until the next clay . We were not . long in getting ready , and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 compound . I did not sleep very much that night as I was so excited and longing for the next day to come . We all were up in good time the next morning , the 25th . After breakfast the Germans came to search our kit , but we took good care not to have anything that would be likely to stop us from going . After t hey had finished searching us and packed our things up again , we were fell in and then marched to theguard-roam , where they had some wagons ready to take us to the station . When we had got nicely settled down in the wagons , we set off to the town station . INly old chum Lew was the driver , so I was able to have a chat with him on our way , and waving our hands and shouting to the bi ) ys who were watching us off . At last we arrived at the station , wondering if we would be put in trucks for our journey . I would not have minded what they pu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 was leaving t he country ; that was the on ly thing that troubled me . We were told off to second-class carriages and we made ourselves comfortable fort he long ride , which turned out to be thirty-six hours . We left Wittenberg at ten past twelve mid-day . We began to feel a lot . safer when the train got on the move , for I did not feel safe until then ; I had been disappointed so many times I could not trust them . We had a pleasant journey right up to - Konstanz . We stopped twice for food , which was the best I ever had from them . At one station they brought its mashed pot zit oes , cutlets and coffee , which I may say were very good . I thought . it t he I ime , what a vast difference to what . I had when I went to Germany . The feeds were just as opposite as t he journeys ; a bad welcome and a good send-oir . We arrived at Konst an z twelve midnight , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people up to see the English prisoners arrive . As we were being marched to the barracks , some of the people greeted us with a few jeers , but I did not . mind that as I was used to their ways . There is an excuse for them as they do not deleted material // from the very edge of the frontier to our destination Chateau ( l'Oexl , I have never cheered so much before in my life . For five days after the journey I could hardly speak at all , as I had cheered myself hoarse . flowers , chocolate , newspapers , cigarettes were coining hrough the windows as we were traveling along , and when we stopped at any station we was practically bombarded with flowers and every comfort we could think of . I have never seen such kindness before . We fairly trimmed the train up with flowers , inside and out as well . Our first stop for lunch was at Berne . The station was swarmed with people who had stayed up all night to see us come through ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we had lunch . It is only a few yards across the platform , but I had my arms full of good things . ' Oh , do take this and - this ' ? they kept on piling them up . Some of them were putting things into my pockets before I got back to the carriage . I got back into the train looking more like Fat her Xmas just going on his visiting rounds . Some one was that anxious to give me something , they gave me an inkwell full of ink . Of course when I put my hand in my pocket I felt it wet , and when I looked atmy hand , it had changed color . Then there was a dear old lady who asked me if I wanted any clothes sent ore I thanked her very much for her kind offer and told her that I. had plenty , as I did not like to impose on her generosity . ' Oh , but you must let me send you something ! I am English , you know , and I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking what I required most , I said , ' If you are so kind as to insist on sending me something , you might send me a razor as I am wanting a shave very bad . ' Oh , I shall be so pleased to send you one ! Is there anything else I can do for you ? Are you married ? Do let me send a few lines toyour wife ; I know she will be pleased to know that you are in Switzerland and in good hands . ' So I gave her my wife 's address as well as mine , and t he dear old lady kept her promise , as 1 had not been at . Cha lean d'Oex long before a splendid safety-razor came , for which 1 shall always t hank her . Then we set off again with cheer after cheer ringing through the station . At every small station and level crossing there was a lot of people gathered together to get . just a glimpse of us as we passed by , and we gave t hem all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only stayed t here a few minutes ; some nurses brought us milk and coffee , then we were bombarded again with flowers and comforts of every kind . The trouble was , we hardly knew where to put the good things as we had got . so many ; then , after a few more cheers and ' It ' s a long way to Tipperary , ' we set off again to Mont rimy . When we got t here we had to change trains , so we collected our presents and some of t he flowers , as it , was impossible to carry t hem all , and marched to t he Hotel Suisse where we had breakfast , and we had a grand spread t here . Everybody was wanting to talk to us all at once . After we had our breakfast we had a look round t he hotel , which is a very fine place . Then we had tickets given to us for our journey up the mountains to Chateau d Dex by electric trams .
