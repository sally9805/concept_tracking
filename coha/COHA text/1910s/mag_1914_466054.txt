I do not suppose that many will agree with me , but in my opinion it would be more agreeable , and would improve the general conversation , if all drinks of an intoxicating nature were abolished from the dining-table . It is gratifying to know that there are some families ( may the number increase every day ) where intoxicating liquors are never seen on their tables . So long as the liquor traffic is extensively and profitably carried on in Europe and America , and so long as the consumption of alcohol is so enormous , so long will there be a difference of opinion as to its ill effects ; but in this matter America , by means of its State prohibition laws , is setting an example to the world . In no other country are there such extensive tracts without alcohol as the " dry States " of America . China , who is waging war on opium , recognizes in this fact a kindred , active moral force , which is absent elsewhere , and , shaking hands with her sister republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day be as free of alcoholicpoisons as China hopes to be of opium . The facts and arguments adduced against tobacco-smoking , strong drink , and poisonous foods are set forth in such a clear and convincing manner in a book written by a talented American lady , that soon after reading it I became a teetotaler and " sanditarian " and began at once to reap the benefits . I felt that I ought not to keep such a good thing to myself , but that I should preach the doctrine far and wide . I soon found , however , that it was an impossible task to try and save men from themselves , and I acquired the unenviable sobriquet of " crank " ; but I was not dismayed . From my native friends I turned to the foreign community in Peking , thinking that the latter would possess better judgment , appreciate and be converted to the sanditarian doctrine . Among the foreigners I appealed to , one was a distinguished diplomat , and the other a gentleman in the Chinese service with a world-wide reputation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my earnest hope that by reading this book , which was sent to them , they would be convinced of their errors and turn over a new leaf . I was disappointed . Both , inreturning the book , made substantially the same answer : " It is very interesting , but at my time of life it is not advisable to change life-long habits . I eat flesh moderately , and never drink much wine . " They both seemed to overlook the crucial question whether or not animal food contains hurtful poison . If it does , it should not be eaten at all . The rule of moderation is applicable to things which are nutritious , or at least harmless , but not to noxious food , however small the quantity of poison it may contain . Pleasant conversation at the dinner-table is always enjoyable , and a good talker is always welcome , but I often wonder why Americans , who generally are so quick to improve opportunity , and are noted for their freedom from traditional conventionalisms , do not make a more systematic use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is a witty conversationalist , with a large fund of anecdote , is sure to be asked by every dinner host to help to entertain the guests , but if the company be large the favorite can be enjoyed only by a few , and those who are too far away to hear , or who are just near enough to hear a part but not all , are likely to be aggrieved . They can not hear what is amusing the rest , while the talk elsewhere forbids their conversing as they would if there were no interruptions . A raconteur generally monopolizes half the company , and leaves the other half out in the cold . This might be avoided if talkers were engaged to entertain the whole company during dinner , as pianists are now sometimes engaged to play to them after dinner . Or , the entertainment might be varied by engaging a good professional reciter to reproduce literary gems , comic or otherwise . I am sure the result would bring more general satisfaction to the guests than the present method of leaving them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese geishas talk , sing , or dance . The ideal would here again seem to be an amalgamation of East and West . It is difficult for a mixed crowd to he always agreeable , even in the congenial atmosphere of a good feast , unless the guests have been selected with a view to their opinions rather than to their social standing . Place a number of people who have ideas in common , with a difference , around a well-spread table , and there will be no lack of good , earnest , instructive conversation . Most men and women can talk well if they have the right sort of listeners . If the hearer is unsympathetic the best talker becomes dumb . Hosts who remember this will always be appreciated . As a rule , a dinner conversation is seldom worth remembering , which is a pity . Man , the most sensible of all animals , more readily leans to nonsense than to rational discourse . Perhaps the flow of words may be as steady as the eastward flow of the Yangste-Kiang in my own country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vague , undefined ? what ? The conversation , like the flavors provided by the cooks , has been evanescent . Why should not hostesses make as much effort to stimulate the minds of their guests as they do to gratify their palates ? What a boon it would be to many a bashful man , sitting next to a lady with whom he has nothing in common , if some public entertainer during the dinner relieved him from the necessity of always thinking as to what he should say next ? How much more he could enjoy the fine dinners his hostess has provided ; and as for the lady ? what a number of suppressed yawns she might avoid ! To take great pains and spend large sums to provide tasty food for people who can not enjoy it because they have to talk to one another , seems a pity . Let one man talk to the crowd , and leave them leisure to eat , is my suggestion . The opportunities afforded at the dining-table may be turned to many useful purposes . In China when people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the matters in dispute are amicably arranged . These are called " peace dinners . " I would recommend that a similar expedient should be adopted in America ; many a knotty point could be disposed of by a friendly discussion at the dinner-table . Inter-national disputes might be arranged in this way , and the representatives of nations having complaints against one another might sometimes discover unexpected ways of adjusting their differences if they dined together once or twice . Why should such matters always be remanded to formal conferences and set speeches ? The preliminaries , at least , would probably be better arranged at dinner parties and social functions . Eating has always been associated with friendship . " To eat the salt " with an Arab forms a most binding contract . Even " the serpent " in the Book of Genesis commenced his acquaintance with Eve by suggesting a meal . It almost seems as if there were certain unwritten laws in American society , assigning certain functions to certain days in the week . I do not believe Amer-icans are superstitious , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one occasion that Mrs. Grant , widow of the great general , sent an invitation to my wife and myself to dine at her house one Thursday evening three weeks in advance , and we readily accepted her invitation . After our acceptance , about a dozen invitations came for that same Thursday , all of which we had , of course , to decline . Curiously enough , we received no invitations for any other day during that week , and just before that eventful Thursday we received a letter from Mrs. Grant canceling the invitation on account of the death of one of her relations , so that we had to dine at home , after all . Now we Chinese make no such distinctions between days . Every day of the week is equally good ; in order , however , to avoid clashing with other people 's engagements , we generally fix Fridays for our receptions or dinners , but there is not among Chinese an entertainment season as there is in Washington and other great cities . During the season I frequently attended " at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen places or more in one afternoon , but no one can dine during the same evening in more than one place . In this respect America might learn a lesson from China . We can accept half a dozen invitations to dinner for one evening ; all we have to do is to go to each place , partake of one or two dishes , then excuse ourselves to the host and go somewhere else . By this means we avoid the seeming rudeness of a declination and escape the ill-feeling which is frequently cre-ated in the Vest by the refusal of invitations . The Chinese method makes possible the cultivation of democratic friendships without violating aristocratic instincts , and for candidates at election-times it would prove an agreeable method by which to make new friends . We are less rigid than Americans about dropping in and taking a mouthful or two at dinner , even without a special invitation . A banquet in America is a more formal affair than the dinners I have been dis:ussing . It is the inevitable rule that on such occasions speeches will follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake of the food , but for the privilege of hearing others talk . Indeed , except for the opportunity of talking , or hearing others talk , people would probably prefer a quiet meal at home . Speakers with a reputation , orators , statesmen , or foreign diplomats , are frequently invited , and sometimes eminent men from other countries are the guests of honor . These functions occur every year , and those Foreign ministers with whose countries the associations have commercial relations are generally present . The topics discussed are nearly always the same , and it is not easy to speak at one of these gatherings without going over the same ground as that covered on previous occasions . I remember a colleague of mine who was a clever diplomat , and for whom I had great respect , who was once asked to make an after-dinner speech . He reluctantly rose and , as far as I can remember , spoke to the following effect : " Mr.Chairman and gentlemen , I thank your association for inviting me to this splendid banquet . As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to add , and I refer you to that speech , " He then sat down . The novelty of the remark , of course , won him applause , but I wonder what the company really thought of him . For my part , I praised his wisdom , for he diplomatically rebuked all those whose only interest is that which has its birth with the day and disappears with the night . Commercial men do not understand , and are impatient with the restrictions which hedge a foreign minister , and in their anxiety to get speakers they will yon CXXVIII. ? No. 706. - 06look anywhere . On one occasion I received an invitation to go to Canada to attend a banquet at a commercial club in one of the principal Dominion cities . It would have given me great pleasure if I had been able to comply with this request , as I had not then visited Canada , but , contrary to my inclination , I had to decline . I was accredited as Minister to Washington , and did not feel at liberty to visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Public speaking , like any other art , has to be cultivated . However scholarly a man may be , and however clever he may be in private conversation , when called upon to speak in public he may sometimes make a very poor impression . I have known highly placed foreign officials , with deserved reputations for their wisdom and ability , who were shockingly poor speakers at banquets . They would hesitate and almost stammer , and would prove quite incapable of expressing their thoughts in any sensible or intelligent manner . In this respect personal observations have convinced me that Americans , as a rule , are better speakers than .. . ( I will not mention the nationality in my mind ; it might give offense ) . An American who , without previous notice , is called upon to speak , generally acquits himself creditably . He is nearly always witty , appreciative , and frank . This is due , I believe , to the thorough-going nature of his education . He is taught to be self-confident , to believe in his own ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A diffident and retiring man , whose chief characteristic is extreme modesty , is not likely to be a good speaker ; but Americans are free from this weakness . Far be it from me to suggest that there are no good speakers in other countries . America can by no means claim a monopoly of orators : there are many elsewhere whose sage sayings and forcible logic are appreciated by all who hear or read them ; but , on the whole , Americans excel all others in the readiness of their wit and their power to make a good extempore speech on any subject without opportunity of preparation . Neither is the fair sex . in America be-hind the men in this respect . I have heard some most excellent speeches by women , speeches which would do credit to an orator , but they labor under a disadvantage . The female voice is soft and tow , it is not easily heard in a large room , and consequently the audience sometimes does not appreciate woman speakers to the extent that they deserve . I know a lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a very popular speaker , but she is an exception . Anyhow , I believe the worst speaker , male or female , could improve by practising private declamation , and awakening to the importance of articulation , modulation , and ? the pause . At large receptions , such as those given in all American cities , however spacious the reception - hall , there is often not even standing-room for all who attend . It requires but little imagination to understand the condition of the atmosphere without proper ventilation . Now , what always astonished me was that , although the parlor might be crowded with ladies and gentlemen , all the windows were , as a rule , kept closed , with the result that the place was full of vitiated air . Frequently , I have had to slip away after a short time , although I would willingly have remained longer on account of the charming company . No wonder we often hear of the host or hostess being ill on the morning after a big function . When men understand this they will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know how many persons pay even a little attention to this important subject of pure-air breathing ? You gu to an office , whether large or small , and you will find all the windows closed , although there may be half a dozen or more persons working in the room . When you call at a private residence you will often find the same thing ? all the windows closed . If you should venture to suggest that one of the windows be opened , the lady of the house would at once tell you that you would feel a draught and so catch cold . It is a matter of daily occurrence to find a number of persons dining in a room where there is no outlet for the contaminated air to leak out , or for the fresh air to conic in . After dinner the gentlemen adjourn to the library to en joy for an hour or so , with closed win dows , the sweet perfumes of smoking What a picture would be presented if thi bacteria in the air could be photographed enlarged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown in a cinematograph It is a common practice , I fear , among certain classes , at least , to keep the windows of the bedroom closed , except in hot weather . I have often suggested to people that for the sake o their health they should at least keel one of the windows , if not more , open dur ? ing the night , but they have pooh-poohec the idea on account of the bugaboo oi " draught . " It is one of the mysteries of the age that people should be willing to breathe second-hand air when there so much pure air out-of-doors to he hac " for nothing ; and after inhaling and exhaling the same air over and over again al through the night , it is not strange that many rise in the morning languid anc dull instead of feeling refreshed and it high spirits . The cumulative result of impure air is bad health . No one whc is deprived of fresh air can long remain efficient . America professes to believe in publicity , and what is " publicity " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this philosophy and it will be easy to keep on the sunny side of the street and to discourage the glooms . The joys fly in at open windows . Much has been written and more said about American manners , or , rather , the American lack of manners . Americans have frequently been criticized for their bad breeding , and many sarcastic references to American deportment have been made in my presence . I have even been told ( I do not know how true it is ) that European diplomats dislike being stationed in America , because of their aversion to the American way of doing things . Much , too , has been written and said about Chinese manners , not only by foreigners , but also by Chinese . One of the classics which our youth have to know by heart is devoted almost entirely to manners . There has also been much adverse criticism of our manners or our excess of manners , though I have never - ward that any diplomats have , on this account , objected to being sent to China . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Americans . In regard to manners , neither of us finds much favor with foreigners , though for diametrically ) pposite reasons ; the Americans are ac-:used of observing too few formalities , and we of observing too many . The Americans are direct and straight-Forward , They will tell you to your face that they like you and occasionally they also have very little hesitation in telling you that they do not like you . They say Frankly just what they think . It is immaterial to them that their remarts are personal , perhaps uncomplimentary . The directness of Americans is seen riot only in what they say , but in the way they say it . They come directly to the point , without much preface or introduction ; much less is there any circumlocution or " beating about the bush . " When they come to see you they say their say and then take their departure ; moreover , they say it in the most terse , concise , and unambiguous manner . In this respect what a contrast they are to us ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we talk of the weather , of politics or friends ? of anything , in fact , which is as far as possible From the object of the visit . Only after this introduction do we broach the subject uppermost in our minds , and throughout the conversation polite courtesies are exchanged whenever the opportunity arises . These elaborate preludes and interludes may , to the strenuous , ever - in - a - hurry American , seem useless and superfluous , but they serve a good purpose . Like the common courtesies and civilities of life , they pave the way for the speakers , especially if they are strangers ; they improve their tempers and place them generally on terms of mutual understanding . It is said that some years ago a foreign consul in China , having a serious complaint to make on behalf of his nation , called on the Taotai , the highest local authority in the port . He found the Chinese official so genial and polite that after half an hour 's conversation he advised the complainant to settle the trouble amicably without bothering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be said onbehalf of both systems . The American practice has at least the merit of saving time , an all-important object with the American people . When we recall that this remarkable nation will spend millions of dollars to build a tunnel under a river or to shorten a curve in a railroad , merely that they may save two or three minutes , we are not surprised at the abruptness of their speech . Americans act up to their Declaration of Independence , especially the principle it enunciates concerning the equality of man . They lay so much importance on this that they do not confine its application to legal rights , but extend it even to social intercourse . In fact , I think this doctrine is the basis of the so-called American manners . All men arc deemed socially equal , whether as friend and friend , as President and citizen , as employer and employee , as master and servant , or as parent and child . Their relationship may be such that one is entitled to demand , and the other to render , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but outside that they are on the same level . This is doubtless a rebellion against all the social ideas and prejudices of the Old World , but it is perhaps only what might be looked for in a new country , full of robust and ambitious manhood , disdainful of all traditions which in the least savor of monarchy or hierarchy , and eager to blaze a new path for itself in the social as it has succeeded in accomplishing in the political world . Combined with this is the American characteristic of saving time . Time is precious to all of us , but to Americans it is particularly so . We all wish to save time , but the Americans care much more about it than the rest of us . Then there are different notions about this question of saving time , different notions of what wastes time and what does not ; and much that the Old World regards as politeness and good manners Americans consider as sheer waste of time . Time , they think , is far too precious to be occupied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say , be much more profitably filled with other and more useful occupations . In any discussion of American manners it would be unfair to leave out of consideration their indifference to ceremony and their highly developed sense of the value of time ; but in saying this I do not forget that many Americans are devout ritualists , and that these find both comfort and pleasure in ceremony ; which suggests that , after all , there is something to he said for the Chinese who have raised correct deportment almost to the rank of a religion . The youth of America have not unnaturally caught the spirit of their elders , so that even children consider themselves almost on a par with their parents , while the parents , on the other hand , also treat them as if they were equals , and allow them the utmost free-dom . While a Chinese child renders unquestioning obedience to his parents ' orders , such obedience as a soldier yields to his superior officer , the American child must have the whys and the wherefores duly explained to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not his parent that he obeys , but expediency and the dictates of reason . Here we see the clear-headed , sound , common-sense business man in the making . The early training of the boy has laid the foundation for the future man . The child , too , has no compunction in cor-recting a parent ? even before strangersand , what is still more curious , the parent accepts the correction in good part , and sometimes even with thanks . A parent is often interrupted in the course of a narrative or discussion by a small , piping voice , setting right , or what it believes to he right , some date , place , or fact , and the parent , after a word of encouragement or thanks , proceeds . How different is our rule that a child is not to speak until spoken tol In Chinese official life under the old regime it was not etiquette for one official to contradict another , especially when they were unequal in rank . When a high official expressed views which his subordinates did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but had to remain silent . I remember that some years ago 1 and some of my colleagues had an audience with a very high official , and when I expressed my dissent from some of the views of that high functionary he rebuked me severely . Afterward he called me to him privately and spoke to me somewhat as follows : " What you said just now was quite correct . I was wrong , and I will adopt your views , but you must not contradict me in the presence of other people . Do not do it again . " There is , of course , much to be said for and against each system , and perhaps a blend of the two would give good results . Anyhow , we can trace in American customs that spirit of equality which pervades the whole of American society , and observe the germs of self-reliance and independence so characteristic of Americans , whether men , women , or children . Even the domestic servant does not lose this precious American heritage of equality . I have nothing to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one can be found ) . On the contrary , none is more faithful or more efficient . But in some respects he is unique among the servants of the world . He does not see that there is any inequality between him and his master . His master ? or should I say his employer ? ? pays him certain wages to do certain work , and he does it , but outside the bounds of this contract they are still man and man , citizen and citizen . We of the Old World are accustomed to regard domestic service as a profession in which the members work for advancement , without much thought of ever changing their position . A few clever persons may ultimately adopt another profession and , according to our antiquated , conservative ways of thinking , rise higher in the social scale , but for the large majority the dignity of a butler or a housekeeper is the height of their ambition , the crowning-point in their career . Not so the American servant . Strictly speaking , there are no servants in America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , who happens for the moment to be your servant is only servant for the time being . He has no intention of making domestic service his profession , of being a servant for the whole of his life . To be subject to the will of others , even in the small degree to which American servants are subordinate , is offensive to an American 's pride of citizenship ; it is contrary to his conception of American equality . He is a servant only for the time and until he finds something better to do . He accepts a menial position only as a stepping-stone to some more independent employment . Is it to be wondered at that American servants have manners different from their brethren in other countries ? When foreigners find that American servants are not like servants in their own country , they should not resent their behavior . It does not denote disrespect , it is merely the outcrop of their natural independence and aspirations . American manners are but an instance or result of the two predominant American characteristics to which I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things American . A love of independence and of equality , early inculcated , and a keen abhorrence of waste of time , engendered by the conditions and circumstances of a new country , serve to explain practically all the manners and mannerisms of Americans . Even the familiar spectacle of men walking with their hands deep in their trousers pockets or sitting with their legs crossed needs no other explanation ; and to suggest that , because Americans have some habits which are peculiarly their own , they are either inferior or unmanly , would be to do them a grave injustice . Few people are more warm-hearted , genial , and sociable than the Americans . I do not dwell on this , because it is quite unnecessary . The fact is perfectly familiar to all who have the slightest knowledge of them . Their kindness and warmth to strangers are particularly pleasant , and are appreciated by their visitors . In some other countries the people , though not unsociable , surround themselves with so much reserve that strangers are at first chilled and repulsed , although there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found when once you have broken the ice and learned to know them ; but it is the stranger who must make the first advances , for they themselves will make no effort to become acquainted , andtheir manner is such as to discourage any efforts on the part of the visitor . You may travel with them for hours in the same car , sit opposite to them , and all the while they will shelter themselves behind a newspaper , the broad sheets of which effectively prohibit any attempts at closer acquaintance . The following instance , culled from a personal experience , is an illustration . I was a law student at Lincoln 's inn , London , where there is a splendid law library for the use of the students and members of the Inn . I used to go there almost every day to pursue my legal studies , and generally sat in the same quiet corner . The seat on the opposite side of the table was usually occupied by another law student . For months we sat opposite each other without exchanging a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I endeavored to improve matters by occasionally looking up at him as if about to address him , but every time I did so he looked down as though he did not wish to see me . Finally I gave up the at-tempt . This is the general habit with English gentlemen . They will not speak to a stranger without a proper introduction , but in the case I have mentioned surely the rule would have been more honored by a breach than by the observance . Seeing that we were fellow-students , it might have been presumed that we were gentlemen and on an equal footing . How different are the manners of the American ! You can hardly take a walk or go for any distance in a train without being addressed by a stranger , and not infrequently making a friend . In some countries the fact that you are a foreigner only thickens the ice ; in America it thaws it . This delightful trait in the American character is also traceable to the same cause as that which has helped us to explain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only are the citizens of America born equal , but the citizens of the world are also born equal .
