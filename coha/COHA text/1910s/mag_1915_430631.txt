 | I In February , 1867 , George Peabody , a native of Massachusetts , who spent the last thirty years of his life in London where he accumulated a vast fortune , created a trust fund of $1,000,000 to which in July , 1869 , he added another million , to encourage and assist educational efforts in " those portions of our beloved and common country which have suffered from the destructive ravages , and not less disastrous consequences of civil war . " In his letter creating the trust , he said : " I feel most deeply , therefore , that it is the duty and privilege of the most favored and wealthy portions of our nation to assist those who are less fortunate ; and with the wish to discharge , so far as I am able , my own responsibility in this matter , as well as to gratify my desire to aid those to whom I am bound by so many ties of attachment and regard , I give to you , gentlemen , most of whom have been my personal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be by you and your successors held in trust , and the income thereof used and applied in your discretion for the promotion and encouragement of intellectual , moral , or industrial education among the young of the more destitute portions of the Southern and South-western states of our union ; my purpose being , that the benefits intended shall be distributed among the entire population , without other distinction than their needs and the opportunities of usefulness to them . " The following resolutions , adopted March 19 , 1867 , embody the plan of the trustees : Resolved , That for the present the promotion of primary , or common school education , by such means or agencies as now exist , or may need to be created , be the leading object of the Board in the use of the fund placed at its disposal . " 1 . Resolved , That in aid of the above general design , and as promotive of the same , the Board will have in view the furtherance of the Normal School Education for the preparation of teachers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions as by  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | been available , but it was hardly an opportune time for educational enterprises . The popular mind was agitated over the ratification of the new constitution in April , the call for a special session of the legislature in July , and the approach of the regular session of that body in the autumn . Few of the offers previously made to towns and cities had been formally complied with , and Mr. Sears did not visit the state between July , 1868 , and the following January . By April , 1869 , a new school law had been passed providing for the establishment and maintenance of schools for the education of all the children of the state . In August the superintendent of public instruction believed that some of the schools would be opened by October and many of them by January , 1870 . State funds for educational purposes , amounting to about $300,000 would be available and would afford accommodations for about 75,000 children . The Peabody Board could now act as a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the aid appropriated by Mr. Sears , which in 1869 amounted to $6,350 . Wilmington was maintaining free schools by voluntary subscriptions amounting to $7,500 and $1,500 received from the Peabody Board . New Bern had failed to comply with the offer made by the Board in 1868 and was providing for only half of its white children ; but on urgent request of the city council , the original offer was renewed on condition that provision be made for the education of all the white children there . Later the New Bern Academy was opened as a public school to which all the white children of the town were admitted . The sum of $300 was given to Newport on the usual conditions , and the same amount offered to a charity school in Charlotte on condition that it be converted into a public school . Little River Academy received $300 . This school had been made free in all the common English subjects , had helped to break down the " barriers of caste , " and had assisted in uniting the entire community educationally . Smithville received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomasville . The schools in Salisbury had suspended , and Raleigh and some other towns to which offers of aid had been previously made , had been unsuccessful in their efforts to comply with the THE PEABODY FUND IN NORTH CAROLINA 173  | conditions . In most of these cases Mr. Sears renewed his offers . The public school system established by the legislature in 1868- ' 69 had struggled through its first year with as much success as was expected in times of such violent party strife . Both coldness and opposition had confronted it . Moreover , taxes had been only imperfectly collected , the schools , therefore , poorly supported , and there was a lack of general educational interest , competent teachers and competent officials . The school population of 1870 was about 384,000 , and the total enrollment was slightly in excess of 50,000 . But there was an encouraging growth of educational sentiment in towns and communities which were being stimulated to local effort by the Peabody Board . Wilmington assumed control and support of its schools , which had previously been maintained by private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their support , and the Peabody Board continuing its aid of $1,000 . New Bern was this year , 1870 , receiving $300 from the fund . Fayetteville was promised $1,000 ; the sum of $600 was appropriated to Washington to assist a white school and a colored school ; Hillsboro received $500 , Oak Ridge $150 , and a colored school in Charlotte $200 . In addition to these fifteen smaller places had fulfilled the conditions which were attached to the Peabody appropriations and in 1870 received $300 each . The following year did not see very many encouraging signs of educational growth in North Carolina , and the public mind , in the matter of free schools , was not so well settled there as in most of the other Southern States . The supreme court had decided that the school law , so far as it provided for local school taxes , was unconstitutional and could not be enforced ; the legislature levied no school taxes for 1871 , and the county commissioners were in many cases accused of using the capitation taxes for other than educational purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes . The principle of general education by public support had been ageed upon as the correct principle ; but its application , in North Carolina at least , proved a more difficult task . Educational legislation , though well intended , had been hurriedly framed by lawmakers of little experience ; local tax legislation  | was vague and uncertain and litigation was resorted to by those who were opposed to it ; officials seemed to have but little interest in the schools , many of which languished for want of proper administration . These were some of the conditions which Mr. Sears faced in his work in North Carolina in 1871 . But he continued his labors there discreetly and with caution . He found opposition in New Bern being rapidly overcome and the " partisan private schools " giving way to the generous provisions of the Peabody appropriations . To this town and to Wilmington he gave $1,000 each , the sum of $1,000 was apropriated to aid teachers ' institutes , and twenty-five other schools , three of which were for negroes , each received amounts ranging from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July , 1873 , the general agent did not report educational conditions in the state any more promising than hitherto . Indifference among the common people and a lack of co-operation among public men were everywhere noticeable . " Nowhere , " said Mr. Sears , " has it been more clearly demonstrated that half-measures in establishing and supporting public schools can not be attended with great success . " It was feared that in many , if not in most , of the counties no schools would open in the fall ; systematic and energetic efforts were needed to enlighten the people so that they would demand of the legislature a working system of schools . The popular mind was confused and disconcerted . The opinion was prevalent that school boards might , under the constitution of 1869 , introduce " mixed schools , " and this fear , together with instances of gross maladministration in the schools , intensified and deepened the prevailing prejudice against the system . Feeling was intense . Eminent men at an educational convention in Raleigh in 1873 made " public statements . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but flattering . " And the protracted consideration by both houses of Congress of the bill looking to mixed schools and the securing to the freedmen rights identical with whites in hotels , public conveyances , theatres and other places of amusement , caused influential men to rally their forces and attack the whole system of public education .  | Only in the cities and towns , and largely in those which were being aided by the Peabody Board , were any serious efforts being made to maintain free public schools during these stormy days . The wisdom of the original policy of the trustees is confirmed by their action in the face of the discouraging circumstances of the time . They early saw the necessity of giving " preference to places which will , by their example , exert the widest influence upon the surrounding country . " Any other method would have been wasteful , inefficient and probably injurious ; an unwise distribution of their funds could easily have demoralized the very region whose common sense and practical effort needed to be aroused in favor of education . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which were sustained by an intelligent and wholesome public sentiment , served to conciliate opposition when men were violent in the bitter expression of their disgust and restlessness , to enlist community co-operation when all sense of personal responsibility was deadened , and to encourage when apprehension verged on despair . The wisdom of the plan , adhered to so strictly , yet so discreetly and with such astonishing success , was early confirmed in many communities , and has had its triumphant vindication in the subsequent movement in the South for local taxation for school purposes . Wilmington furnished an early example of the influence of the policy in North Carolina . In the winter of 1873 the town became responsible for its schools , and the authorities levied a local tax to supplement the county and state school taxes , to make more adequate provision for its children who now numbered nearly 1,000 . " We flatter ourselves , " wrote the chairman of the local school committee , " that the start now taken in Wilmington will , in time , extend to every part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July , 1873 , Wilmington and Newbern received $1,000 each . Washington received $600 , Hillsboro $500 , and thirty other schools , including three for  | negroes , received aid in amounts from $300 to $450 . The sum of $300 was also appropriated to aid teachers ' institutes . The noble design of the great philanthropist was being followed with fidelity and jealous care . In the work of the school year ending June , 1874 , the superintendent of public instruction noticed an improvement in both pupils and teachers , and consequently increased interest in public education ; the influence of the Peabody Board received credit from that officer for this change . The school law was still defective , however , in that it failed to provide for the education and training of teachers and for efficient county and district supervision , and no authority for local taxation . " The people are not deficient in energy or public spirit , " declared the superintendent , " or in a due appreciation of popular education . Our great want is statesmen in our legislative halls , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Public Schools for the education of their children . " That want of active county supervision has been very greatly felt in administering the Peabody Education Fund . " Mr. Sears , however , felt more hopeful for the future . He was convinced that " nothing in the future is more certain than the acceptance of that principle , the doctrine of free schools by the people at large , if they are free to act without unwelcome influence from abroad . " And to hasten this time he distributed more than $12,000 to thirty different communities , Wilmington receiving $2,000 , New Bern $1,000 and Charlotte $1,050 . The other places , among which were three negro schools , received from $200 to $450 , and the sum of $100 was appropriated to teachers ' institutes . By 1875 the schools aided by the fund were numerous in the state , and the appropriations were larger than for any other year . Charlotte and New Bern received $1,000 each , the Educational Journal received $200 , and negro schools in Charlotte , Fayetteville , and Tarboro , were given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $300 each . Interest in public education was gradually increasing , though the state was not making equal educational progress with Virginia . The successful operation of such schools and the free discussion of education soon led to the conviction that public  | schools were a necessity . In general , however , no great changes in public sentiment appeared in August , 1876 , though steady progress in that direction was seen in spite of new obstacles . The state superintendent was charged with irregularities in the management of funds and resigned , and a successor was tardily named in his place . The state tax for schools was slight . A local tax was hardly known , and the policy of appointing politicians to head the educational system had revealed its extreme weakness and danger . The general financial embarrassment , common to all the Southern States , and the maladministration in the handling of school funds , made conditions even more discouraging . Educational legislation prepared hastily by those who had no experience to guide them , was commonly defective . Offices had been needlessly multiplied and unwisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibilities were divided , and chances of active official co-operation were greatly decreased . The unwarranted outside interference in educational matters which Mr. Sears viewed with apprehension3 complicated an already anomalous condition ; but the work of Mr. Sears and his board , and the sight of success in the schools aided from that source , helped to keep alive a certain educational spirit . Between October , 1875 , and the summer of 1876 , aid was given to teachers ' institutes , the Educational Journal , and more than a dozen towns . Wilmington , New Bern , Warrenton , and Greensboro received the largest appropriations . Four negro schools were assisted also , at Fayetteville , Charlotte , Tarboro , and Raleigh . The return to " home rule " was made in North Carolina in 1876 , when the conservatives regained the state government . The new constitution was adopted January 1 , 1877 , and the liability of having mixed schools , which had been a matter of great consideration , was now removed . Forward educational steps are at once in evidence . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two normal schools , one for each race , and for their equal support from the state . A crying need of the years of reconstruction was for competent teachers , and the only safe , thorough , efficient and permanent  | policy was state establishment and support of normal schools . The legislature appropriated $2,000 to each of these institutions . Authority . vas also granted towns of a certain size to levy an extra property tax for schools of as much as one-tenth of one per cent and a capitation tax of thirty cents . The former property tax of eight and one-third cents and a capitation tax of twenty-five cents for educational purposes were continued . Mr. Sears seems encouraged : " Public schools are now fairly put upon their own merits . There can henceforth be little question of their perpetuity , for the tide of public opinion has been recently turned and set so strong in their favor that it will not be easy to resist it . " From the summer of 1876 to the summer of 1877 the Peabody Board appropriated $1,500 to Raleigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to normal schools , $950 to the delinquences of the state superintendent , and nine other schools each received from $250 to $450 . Among these were two negro schools , one at Fayetteville and one at Charlotte . Certain definite results of the influence of the fund appear : it aided in the stimulation of local enterprise and community patriotism and the gradual rise of city and town school systems ; in encouragement to the final establishment of complete state systems of schools ; in the gradual removal of hostility to educating the freedmen ; and it had a tendency to aid in removing the bitter spirit of sectionalism . We have already seen that as much as $87,600 was appropriated to North Carolina during the first ten years of the operation of the fund . This means that communities raised by local taxation or otherwise between $175,000 and $262,000 for free school purposes , affording approximately between $262,000 and $350,000 for education in the state which would otherwise not have been available . This does not , however , represent the permanent value of the spirit of local effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the state ; it would be difficult to estimate that spirit . It is enough to indicate the manner in which the Peabody appropriations early aided in the development of sentiment for local taxation for school purposes . After 1874 , by special permission of the legislature , several towns and cities  | page deleted  | due to the extreme difficulty and often impossibility of securing qualified teachers for the negro schools . While the trust was established primarily to help meet " the educational needs of those portions of our beloved and common country which have suffered from the destructive ravages , and not less disastrous consequences of civil war , " Mr. Peabody clearly had in mind the promotion of the common good . " This I give to the suffering South for the good of the whole country " was the sentiment which he expressed when he made his second great donation in July , 1869 . This benefaction of a northern man , the caution and tact of his trustees , and the activity of their efficient and able agents , and finally , the influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educational sentiment , which the fund had been so faithfully used in developing , helped to remove much of the bitter sectionalism which was known generally to exist , and to establish and maintain a bond of fellowship between the two sections so lately at war . Mr. Winthrop , for so long chairman of the board of trustees , pronounced the gift " the earliest manifestation of a spirit of reconciliation toward those from whom we have been so unhappily alienated and against whom we of the North had been so recently arrayed in arms .
