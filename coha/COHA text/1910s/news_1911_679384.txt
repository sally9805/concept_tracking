txt Three hundred members gathered at the Princeton Club , In Gramercy Park . last night to hear Dean Andrew F. West tell about the plans for the new Graduate College at Princeton , upon which work is to be started in about thirty days . This is the university department over which Gov . Woodrow Wilson , then President of Princeton , split with Dean West and some of the Trustees and many of the alumni , - with the result that the William Cooper - Procter offer of $500,000 was temporarily withdrawn . Dean West announced , amid great en- ' tiinsiasm on the part of Princeton men . that a fund of between $3,000,000 and 44 ; 000.000 was immediately available for the construction of the necessary buildInge and the conduct of the Graduate School work . The fund , he said , included the William Cooper Procter donation of $500,000 , now given outright ; the Weyman bequest , now known to be between $2,000. - 000 and $3,000,000 : the Swann gift of $325. - 000 , the Grover Cleveland memorial tower contribution , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by friends of the uni*ersity through the efforts of Moses Taylor Pyne of the class of ' TT . The plans for the Graduate College , Mean West announced , have already been drawn by Cram , Goodhue &; Ferguson , architects , of Boston , and approved by red Trustees of Princeton . The contracts call for the completion of the build , including the Thompson Graduate Feliege , the Procter Memorial Dining *Tail , and the Cleveland Tower , by Sete teatber , 1912 . Dean West also told the alumni that - ithese buildings are already staked out . . ' They ' will be erected on the golf links , ( and the plans will cause the relocation of . - the present Pennsylvania Railroad sta -- ticm at Princeton . Another building or two will also be moved , and a broad avenue will be laid out leading from the new Graduate College to the central campus . The plans of the buildings proper - call for a dormitory of square proportions , two or three stories in height and constructed about a quadrangle . This will be known as Thompson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The entrance to the quadrangle will be by means of a Gothic arch , and a part of the ground floor will be given up ' to a general commons . To the west wing of this dormitory will be added a smaller courtyard , flanked by the Procter Memorial ' Dining Hall . surrounded by the kitchens and servants ' quarters . Dean Explains the Plans . " After fourteen years of planning . " said Dean West at the beginning of his audress , " we are at last happily in a position to say-that ground will be broken this Spring for the group of buildings which is to form the first construction of the new Graduate College  --  and as the spade goes in the ground it will mean not only the rising of the new college - but the burial of old controversy . " Three elements compose the Graduate College  --  first , a body of professors of unusual eminence and power in their various subjects ; second , a company of graduate students of high ability , and , : third , the buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a pity that the question of the buildings has been so much to the fore , because it has obscured the more important question of the students and of the professors . Nevertheless , the buildings are an important part of the project . We are not proposing to build a hotel , a dormitory , a boarding house , or a club for graduate students , but a quiet and beautiful academic home , worthy in every respect of the dignity of learning . " Now a word about the buildings , Dean West continued . " The quadrangle of Thompson College is planned to accommodate approximately 100 graduate students . Each student is to have his own study and bedroom for the all important reason that experience proves that the graduate student , far more than the undergraduate , needs the exclusive and continuous use of his study . A great deal of his work has to be done alone . Moreover , every two suites of student 's rooms will be provided with a small bath and toilet room for the sake of health . - cleanliness. efficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the general amenities of civilized life . Breakfast and luncheon will be served in the small . dining room and dinner in the Memorial Dining Hall . " The Memorial Dining Hall will be a - fftrticture projecting from the southwestern angle of Thompson College and will be about 100 feet in length and 40 feet in width . It will be built to provide for the developed Graduate College and will therefore have a maximum seating capacity of nearly 200 men . This must be done - once for ail at the start , as it would be - absurd to build an additional dining hall - each time an additional group of students is entered at the college . The dining hall will be finished in plain oak paneling and will have a series of beautiful windows . Including a large - western window . Of . course , it is possible to use the dining hall for other purposes of intellectual and social character . The Impressive Cleveland Tower . " The Grover Cleveland Memorial ' Tower will stand at the southeastern corner of Thompson College and will be about forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will be so placed as to command a most extensive view and will be easily visible to the millions ' of travelers who pass Princeton Junction during the year . ' No other memorial - to any President of the United States , save ; only the Washington Monument , twill - equal this tower in dignity and ' beauty . Oi- ' ' The . bane of American architecture sr4SSing , that purity of style is so in41Veliflysattained. but we believe that the group of Graduate College buildings is to be a most notable exception to this statement . Fallowing the newer tradition of Princeton. we are taking the socalled Collegiate Gothic and in the case I of the Graduate College we are taking . not : : once modified Gothic , or business Gothic , or adapted Gothic , or some mixed styles . but the pure perpendicular type which survives In a few beautiful examples in the English colleges . " The buildings will be constructed of gray stone and will be fireproof throughout . The body of the stone will he of steel gray tones . selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be silvery gray in color . The effect of this against the broad green sward , the background of forest trees , especially on a clear day , with a blue sky overhead . ought to be most beautiful . I am one of those who believe that architecture and scenic beauty in a university are most elevating in their effect on its students . Certainly , the charm of the Princeton campus is one of the unfor deleted 2 lines
