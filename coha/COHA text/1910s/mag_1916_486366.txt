On Saturday of this week one of Washing , ton 's most respected citizens will celebrate his eightieth birthday ; and it is safe to say that no friend who offers him the customary congratulations will be in a livelier mood than he , for , in spite of the busy life he has led , Simon Wolf is old only in years . Lawyer , author , philanthropist , public servant , and foremost Hebrew in this part of the country , what has made him a , man of such importance is largely his breadth of vision and interest . Every humane movement has his cordial support , his sympathies drawing no line of creed or nationality , except that , though a Bavarian by birth , he is unqualified in his devotion to the country of his adoption . " There are many Jews , " he says , " who are still seeking the New Jerusalem ; but , being an American first , last , and all the time , I must admit that I have found my Jerusalem in America , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must realize that here his highest hopes and ambitions will find their materialization . " At the outbreak of the Civil War , Wolf offered himself to the ' Union army , but was rejected for defective eyesight . Then , having acquired a knowledge of law , he applied for a position in the War Department . Secretary Stanton dissuaded him , however , and he settied down to private practice . His activities in Washington enabled him to get glimpses of what was going on behind the scenes during the impeachment of President Johnson , and he has made literary use of the material thus gathered . President Grant appointed him Recorder of Deeds of the District of Columbia . and the last commission signed by President Garfield made him Consul-General at Cairo , Egypt , where some of his duties were Practically diplomatic at a critical juncture . Ismail the Magnificent had been deposed by England and France after he had fastened a tremendous burden of taxation upon the common people , many of whom were organizing a revolutionary movement designed to rid the country of foreign influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one evening , sipping his after-dinner coffee , when an English acquaintance , obviously in a state of agitation , approached him , inquiring in an excited whisper : " Have you heard the news , Mr. Consul-General ? There is to be a general rising to-night , and every European and Christian in the city is to be murdered ! " Wolf took another sip of coffee , but made no response , apparently listening for anything further his visitor might have to say . " Do n't you hear me ? " persisted the latter , growing more emphatic in the face of what Seemed to him the hopeless dulness of a man he was trying to help . " Do n't you hear me ? I tell you , the fanatics are planning to-night to kill every European and Christian in Cairo ! " " Oh , yes , I hear you , " responded Wolf coolly , without setting down his cup . " I 'm certainly obliged to you for the news , but I ca n't see how it affects me , for I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associations with which ' Simon Wolf has been connected is an Anti-Defamation League . He feels that the slanderous or ridiculous lights in which the Hebrew race has been set before the world in books , plays , newspaper articles , and cartoons , not only are a moral injustice , but increase the difficulties of good citizenship for the race , keeping alive a prejudice which would die out if left without such encourage -- meat , and stimulating in the Hebrew whatever inclination he has to separate himself from his Gentile neighbors ; all this creating an unwholesome atmosphere for later generations to grow up in . The future of his people Mr. Wolf regards as assured if the forces now working for its benefit are but allowed their natural play . The recognition of Hebrew heroism in the armies of Europe during the present war appears to him to portend an extension of political rights in countries where these have been hitherto grievously restricted , but in Russia he fears that persecutions will not cease entirely till an end is made of the authority now exercised by the Greek Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a leading part in a movement which prevented the insertion into the State Constitution of North Carolina of a provision making compulsory the reading of the Bible in the public schools " The Bible is a good book to be read by every one , " he said , in explanation of his position , " but the danger of forcing its reading in the schools is that the teachers will read their own interpretation of the book , and not the book itself . " Inns objection was not based on any spirit of religious animos ity , for he is one of the liberal Sews who revere Jesus as a great tea.cher . Of a considerable collection of relics of travel and acquaintance which he has accumulated , he cherishes perhaps most highly a birthday letter written him by John Hay ten years ago , congratulating him " not only upon seventy years of well-spent life , but also upon the mental , moral , and physical soundness and vigor which are the guarantee of many more years of usefulness to the country and humanity at large . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from men whose knowledge of the wi , rld gives their judgment value , which sharpen Mr. Wolf 's regret at the lack of respect manifested by the young people of the present day for their elders , and his wash that some means could be devised for changing their attitude of mind . " This seems to me a serious matter , " he says , " because the fault goes hand-in-hand with the lack of concentration noticeable among our youth . They do not seem to fix their thoughts and energies upon any one thing as they ought , but let them scatter in many different directions . " And with this comment , probably , not a few other observers of the life of our time will heartily agree . TATTLER . The " Three " Candidates BY AN INDEPENDENT VOTER . Not enough has been made of the fact that this year , precisely as in 1912 , the voter has got to make his choice among three candidates for the Presidential election : Mr. Roosevelt , Mr. Hughes , and Mr. Wilson . It is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty the Progressive till into the Republican coffers ; but at the present moment he is trading with his own stock , advertising only his own goods , and , to all intents and purposes , running a quite independent shop . At the present moment , then , the situation of 1912 is repeated , with Mr. Hughes substituted for Mr. Taft , and with Mr. Roosevelt , as ever , the most conspicuous candidate in the field , having , no doubt , as he reviews in many thousands of words the splendid achievements of his own Administration and the contemptible failures of every one else  --  having , no doubt , " the time of his life . " To guide us in our choice among these three men we have had their acts and their speeches . We have had also four rather notable reviews of the present Administration : that by Mr. Eliot in the Atlantic Monthly , that by Mr. Olney in the New York World , that by Mr. Taft in the Yale Review , and Mr. Root 's speech in Carnegie Hall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summaries of Mr. Eliot and Mr. Olney to make their judgments of weight in the independent mind . Mr. Taft , Mr. Root , and Mr. Hughes all speak in the spirit of prosecuting attorneys for the Republican party . Mr Roosevelt , as usual , is unique ; he speaks in the spirit of Cicero against Catiline . When the independent voter has listened to all the arguments and summaries of arguments , his mind reverts irresistibly to the three candidates for a fresh impression of those personal qualities which , in their totality , somehow escape the reckoning , yet for him , in a doubtful case , turn the scale Mr. Wilson 's faith in the Democrats and Mr. Root 's holy enthusiasm for the Republicans leave him cool . What he , wants to know is , who in the next four years is the best man to lead the nation . I submit for consideration the result of such a reversion to the three candidates . Mr. Roosevelt is a barbarian of genius , with a natural tendency towards that bull-headed national egotism which threatens the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last four years by putting himself at the head of three great movements . He has shown his barbarism by esteeming these movements as nothing in comparison with being at the head of them . Like a genius , he put himself at the head of a movement for social progress ; like a roving barbarian , he abandoned the movement to Mr. Wilson . Like a genius , he put himself at the head of a movement for - " preparedness " ; like a barbarian , he urged " preparedness " in support of the essentially aggressive foreign policy which has wrecked Europe ; and so Mr. Wilson and the American people took " preparedness " out of his hands , and Mr. Wilson kept his own foreign policy . Like a genius , a spendthrift genius , a poverty-stricken genius , yet still like a. genius , he put himself at the head of the movement called " Anything to beat Wilson " ; and like a barbarbian he has led it . Mr. Roosevelt has quick sympathies , imagination , passion , initiative , and driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barbarian of genius . His speeches and his books are full of these qualities , and , in their kind , they are good reading . They seem to mean what they say , and to mean it hard  --  at least for the moment ' They have , in general , no intellectual distinction whatever  --  intellectual distinction is not a barbaric quality ; but they have the distinction given by strong passion and driving energy . " The actual grapple with an angry grisly , " says the Wilderness Hunter , " is full of strong , eager pleasure . " That healthy barbaric spirit Mr. Roosevelt carries into politics ; and it gives him genuine distinction . All that he says about the uses of the " big stick " comes straight from the hot heart of the man . He has not merely the courage of his convictions ; he has also the heat and glow of them . I can - understand a desire to vote for Mr. Roosevelt . He is the genius of the Republican party  --  the genius rejected by the Republican party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulk of which Mr. Penrose and Mr. Barnes and Mr. Perkins are the hands and feet , Mr. Roosevelt expresses it . Mr. Root , trying to express its soul , calling for the heroic mood and a high tariff and rebaptism in blood to save the American people from the fat ease of Democratic prosperity ? Mr. Root in this role is surely funny  --  funny , of course , in a very elevated and decorous way . No , Mr. Roosevelt is the " spirit of God " roving in the purlieus of the Repub .. lican party , and , if I were a believer , as he is , in what a Nation reviewer has called " the tribal Jehovah , " I should vote for Mr. Roosevelt . If I thought that the country needed at this hour to be led by a man without much intellectual distinction , yet greatly distinguished by passion and driving energy , a barbarian of genius ? I should vote for Mr. Roosevelt . But here , for the " spiritually " minded element in the Republican party , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Roosevelt can coin fine hot words about the " heroic mood , " but he has not now and will not have later the power to give them effect . The power , if his own wishes are fulfilled , will lie in the hands of a man of utterly different temper . Mr. Hughes , regret it as one may , has revealed himself since his nomination as little more than a legalistic hyphen between Mr. Roosevelt and Mr Wilson . Mr. Hughes , as all men admit , is upright , intelligent , energetic , and " firm as a rock " ; but he gives no token of possessing genius of any description . All that his sponsors , even , ask us to believe is that he is firm as a rock , energetic , intelligent , and upright . He is , like Mr. Taft , an able legalistic critic of the issues created by other men . His speech of acceptance was a deadly blow to the expectation with which his advent in national politics had been awaited ; and nothing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual and emotional mediocrity which it produced . His energy is strong , but colorless ; his intelligence is vigorous , but it lacks flexibility ; his uprightness is admirable , but it is unimaginative Nothing could be more uninspiring than his nagging prosecution of the Administration ; the effect is of a Roosevelt without passion and with only a modicum of conviction . His sympathies appear to be sluggish , his wards are without the glow of sincerity , he opens no vistas , he betrays no spark of shaping and creative energy or imagination . He never says anything vulgar , but he never says anything fine ; and one guesses that , though he will never do anything base , he will never do anything splendid . He has n't the source of splendor in him ; he has no genius . He is not a great and many-talented barbsrian like Mr. Roosevelt ; he is an entirely respectable and competent civilian like Mr. Taft and Mr. McKinley ; and if he is elected , he will have just about as much influence upon the tone and temper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had . If I thought the country most needed at this hour an unimaginative business administration , making things as " shipshape " as possible , yet keeping them about as they are , I should vote for Mr. Hughes and the Old Guard . But I have a strong conviction that what the country most needs is a man of utterly different temper . Mr. Wilson is a civilian of genius inspired by and inspiring others by his great and splendid vision of a democratized and a civilized world . He is not to be compared with Mr. Hughes ; by virtue of his genius he is to be compared with Mr. Roosevelt . His sympathies are as quick as Mr. Roosevelt 's , his imagination as active , his passion as strong , his initiative as unquestionable , his driving energy as undeniable  --  let stand as witnesses of that the coherent , disciplined phalanx which he has made of that wandering unfed multitude the Democratic party and the programme of legislation which it has carried out What sets him apart and distinguishes him as a genius from Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Spirit of God " which he represents . Mr. Roosevelt 's peculiar excellence is in his energy and passion ; Mr. Wilson 's peculiar excellence is in his intelligence and his reasonableness . While the temper of Mr. Roosevelt , as Professor Miinsterberg has suggested , is akin to that of the Kaiser , Mr. Wilson 's temper is akin to that of Englishmen like Lord Bryce and the best statesmen of France . Mr. Roosevelt appeals to force and sends the fleet ; Mr. Wilson appeals to reason and sends a note  --  which is after all the really civilized mode of getting one 's ideas of right and justice before the world . Incidentally , Mr. Wilson 's notes and speeches are almost invariably so humane in feeling , so persuasive in manner , so distinguished in style , as to excite Mr. Roosevelt 's envy and his barbaric spleen ; and he has accordingly done what in him lay to convince the American people that a +President who writes well , who writes with real intellectual distinction , must be a rascal . Indeed , at every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his superior civility , Mr. Roosevelt has danced and shouted with his war paint on . Possibly Mr. Wilson uttered his " too proud to fight " at an inopportune moment . Mr. Roosevelt with barbaric delight snatched the phrase out of its context , and repeated it from one end of the country to the other as something to bring a blush of shame to every American cheek . Well , in the opinion of a good many decent people , whose number is certainly increasing , " too proud to fight " is precisely the keynote of a civilized foreign policy for a great and powerful state to adopt towards small and " backward " nations . It was not the foreign policy of Rome or of Great Britain or , avowedly , of the United States , in the past . None of the great nations of the world has in the past been too proud to fight for the merchant-missionaries of its empire in any nook or corner of the world . But , some of us are saying , would to God that Austria had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Servia ; would to God that Germany had been too proud of her strength and immensely superior army to fight with Belgium ; and thank God  --  we know how poltroonish these words will sound in the barbaric ear  --  thank God that Mr. Wilson was too proud of the superior strength and civilization of the United States to fight with Mexico . A " firmly " maintained foreign policy of insisting upon one 's own desires , one 's own needs , or even upon one 's own interpretation of law and Justice , will always necessitate preparedness to " fight at the drop of the hat . " To the sense of a barbarian or of an old-fashioned statesman , a foreign policy which is truly civilized and truly democratic , a foreign policy , that is , which recognizes the democratic equality and fraternity of nations , and the right to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness in other nations , must appear " vacillating . " The policy upheld by Mr. Roosevelt and the Elder Statesman is this : Ask for what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tell your man that you will knock him down ; if you still do n't get it , knock him down , or  --  and it does n't always come to the same thing ! ? try to knock him down . The policy upheld ' by Mr. Wilson appears to be this : Ask for what you want , and , if you do n't get it , reason with your man ; if you Still do n't get it , reason with him again , study his point of view , apply economic pressure , but , till you are driven to the very last ditch of argument , do n't lose your temper and go at him with a barbaric club , beating out his brains and yours as well . The example of Mr. Wilson 's heroic reasonableness in international relations of extremely trying character has had , in the opinion of many of us , an immensely salutary influence upon the tone and temper of the American people . It has made them not , as Mr. Roosevelt declares , languid and indifferent and unmanly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and means of civilized life . In the era of reconstruction , which all the leaders assure us is to follow the great war , the silvery Beveridge may pull on his American overalls ( Amerika Jibes Alles ) , and " coin , " as the two-complexioned Chicago Tribune says , his " slogan , " " America Only " ; but there are a good many signs in the air that Mr. Beveridge and his kind will not be very much in demand in the work of reconstruction . The reconstructive hands that are reaching out in England and France and even in Germany to-day are weary of the old barbaric national egotism ; they are feeling for the hands of a civilian of genius with a sense of the democracy of nations , with a great and splendid vision of a civilized world Those who wish these reconstructive hands in Europe to clasp with the hands of the President of the United States will vote for Mr. Wilson . Correspondence FOLLOWERS OF FREUD AND JUNG . TO TAE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : That there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the views of human nature which the followers of Freud and Jung are now erecting into an uncanny religion it is not necessary at this time to deny ; it is possible that more stress should be laid than has hitherto been done upon such conceptions as the persistent activity of motives that have supposedly been suppressed and eliminated , the continuity of adult thoughts and feelings with those of the infantile individual , and the activity of the sex motive beyond its special field . But there is no question that Freud and his followers overwork these concepts to an enormous degree , and by failing to take account of countless other motives and mechanisms in mental life produce a wholly one-sided psychology . They accept Freudism as a religion ; they will not admit any qualification to the least of its tenets , and scarcely any limitation to its scope and usefulness in understanding human activity in all fields , from myth to agriculture . Thus Jung finds it impossible to conceive of any impulse strong enough to awaken man from his apathy to the extent of enabling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire , except libido , which it should be noted , though broadly defined , remains after all the same old libido . A recent writer has proposed the theory that Socrates , so far from being animated by a mere zeal for seeing ideas sprout in the minds of the young men with whom he consorted , must have been driven by a deeper and more potent , though probably unconscious motive  --  namely , the implication is , by a homosexual tendency , which thus expressed itself in a sublimated form . Another finds that " Hamlet " is the expression of Shakespeare 's assumed incestuous inclination towards his own mother . And so it goes : every conspicuous product of human invention in literature , art , or industry is made on " analysis " to give up the same secret . It is impossible to reason with a stanch Freudian , for , once any human activity or product has been interpreted according to Freudian principles , that settles the matter for him ; no other interpretation can get a hearing . But there is no human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by these same Freudian principles . For example , my use , just now , of the expression " Freudian principles " seems an obvious enough act on my part , given the context ; but let me apply the method of " free association " to these words , RS Freud wouldhave me do if there were anything suspicious about them . I then get , starting from " Freudian , " first the name " Freud " itself , then the German " Freude , " meaning " joy , " then a phrase in Wagner 's Siegfried , " froh and freudig , " which reminds me instantly of Nietzsche and his " blonde beast , " who ruthlessly gets what he wants . Next I get the Greek word l8pu , " hybris , " meaning again a ruthless getting what you want , and then the English derivative " hybrid , " which brings to mind irregular sexual relations  --  enough said ! Again , when I start my train of associations with the word " principles , " I immediately get Machiavelli 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The juxtaposition of two such meaningful words as " Freudian " and " principles " is thus extremely suspicious , and leads to the conclusion that my choice of words was not dictated simply by a desire to express my overt meaning , but that the Unconscious in me was thus giving expression to a deep-seated wish , repressed by force of circumstances , for a career of unbridled lust . If I were to go back again with the idea in mind that the " instinct of self-preservation " instead of that of sex was the possible underlying motive , I might get the following series : " Freud , Ford , $60,000,000 made by the Ford Company in a year , like to have a share in that sum " ; and , from " principles , " the Crown Prince , hope that he will be defeated , desire that he and his line should be retired to private life . These two trains of association , like the former two , show a tendency to converge , the meeting-point here being my cupidity and envy , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of words . I do not say , of course , that the Freudians would accept these particular conclusions . They avoid applying their method to cases where it would lead to obviously absurd conclusions , confining themselves to cases where the causes at work in producing an act are obscure . But what I do say is that it ought logically to be applied to such cases as the above as well as to those that the Freudians choose , and that if it is applied impartially , it gives as many absurd as probable conclusions , and , in fact , a great many more , since one can be practically sure of getting results as nonsensical as the above from the Freudian analysis of any human act or product whatsoever . The cases which I have given are not in the least an exaggeration of the Freudian procedure , and they constitute a plain reductio ad absurdum of the Freudian method as a method of scientific discovery . It would have seemed incredible , before the event , that apparently sane individuals should be persuaded to take seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbia University , October 13 . SUMNER 'S ESSAYS . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : Sta : The Yale Press ' plans to issue in the near future a fourth and concluding volume of essays by the late William Graham Sumner . It is intended to include in this volume chiefly essays in the field of economics , and also as full a bibliography of , Sumner 's writings as can be got together . As Sumner kept no list , apparently , of his own writings , it is almost impossible to make an exhaustive collection or bibliography . lie often contributed to newspapers and magazines the contents of which are not indexed in available form . Will you allow me , through your columns , to request suggestions of essays or shorter writings for inclusion in this last volume ? I have frequently been urged , during the last years , not to conclude this series of essays without reprinting this and that remembered favorite , It seems that there are a number of people who have cherished certain writings of ' Professor Sumner which they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have been disappointed that such have not appeared in the preceding volumes . As this enterprise draws to its close , I hope that any such person will make an effort to specify definitely and locate the production which he admires , and let me know about it . ALBERT G.
