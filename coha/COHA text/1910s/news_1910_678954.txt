txt Citizens of the usually staid and quiet little village of Central Islip , which is about as near as any of Long Island 's towns to being at the island 's centre , witnessed a sight ati the village railroad station yesterday which set their nerves on edge and started responsible fathers of families into discussions of slip knots , tar brushes , and the nearest available feather supply . For two hours the people talked over a problem that had been suddenly thrust upon them via an inbound train from I Rig erhead , and then reached two conclusions . One was that tile widow of Irving J. Nelson , who was murdered last September , and Augustus Swartz , a boarder in the Nelson home , who came back yesterday to resume his quarters in the thousehold after being acquitted of the I husband 's murder , could not remain in Central Islip . The other was that unless they moved within a very few hours of their own accord a committee of citizens ? ? would see them to the train . " Ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee to notify the widow of the murdered Nelson and her former and present boarder that they are undesirable in the community . Another committee of ninety citizens will remain in the background , on the first notice ready t% see that the order of banishment is curried out , if the prescribed couple themselves fail to anticipate the committee 's desire . The sight that upset the Central ' Islip folks was the return of Augustus Swartz from jail at Riverhead . Citizens who happened to be near the station when the train came in at noon saw Swartz jump jauntily off . That was the last thing they thought he would ever do . And then to add salt to their wounds they saw the widow of their late fellow-citizen , whose home is in a yellow frame house only a few hundred yards from the station . come out - bedecked in her best clothes to greet the former boarder. who had just been freed after seven months in jail . Indignation Aroused . After they ' had seen Mrs. Nelson take ? S-a-artz-by-theltand end lead him into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A committee of five indignant citizens quickly grew into a committee of ten indignant citizens , and by late aftI ernoon this was augmented into a crowd . There are children in the Nelson household , and their father was a respected resident , for he - was something of a political leader as well as a bicycle racer of repute . In the group of a dozen citizens who finally took the lead in the movement decided upon was one man who had come to Central Islip from New England . He was for calling a town meeting . AnotherhaJ come from the West in his younger days , and he talked freely of vigilance days and shotgun justice , and remarked that he was still handy with his trigger finger . A Bohemian , swarthy under a coat of farmer 's tan , ventured to say he had learned to tie slip knots on board ship , and was willing to tie another . A canny Scotchman who puffed vigorously at a briarwood pipe while he spoke at length said the word which was accepted as final . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . - We 're all of us here hard-working farmers and respectable people . We are n't going to allow this pair to stay among us . What-we need to oo nowsis to organize our.committee and go about it in a regular way . We all know sentiment in this place ai n't changed a hit since wa first heard the gunshots that killed Irving Nelson . We know his wife had a bad reputation among ns then , and we know that as his widow the has n't improved It by the goings on we have seen to-day . " Now , there 's Judge Albert Schwartz . He lives down the road , and he was the man that locked Gus Swartz up the night we found Nelson 's body where it had been dumped from a wagon down the railroad track . I move we adjourn to Judge Schwartz 's home and hold a council on this matter . " The motion carried , and the men went down the main road to a new frame residence into which the furniture , apparently , had Just been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen with Mrs. Schwartz. and he invited them to come in via the rear door to the parlor , the front door , like the lawn , having not yet been put in commission . A Little Embargo . A TIMES reporter , who arrived soon after the original committee , was made welcome , being invited in , with this embargo upon him : " Remember , young man , names do n't go in this story . You 're welcome to hear what we 've got to say , but you ca n't use names just right yet . Later we may all give you our names , for none of us is ashamed of what we 're going to do . But right now we 're , just a committee , and that 's what you 've got to call us . Promise it , and you can come in . " " If there had been a regular full trial , " suggested a bewhiskered citizen who formerly lived in Manhattan . " and this man had been regularly acquitted , and we had any grounds on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all stick by him and give him his full rights to live among But we warned Irving Nelson what kind of a boarder he was taking in before lie was shot down cold in the back without a chance . And any 10-year-old boy ought to , have beep able to present a case on the evidence there was in this affair . But the case did n't happen to be presented and Swartz got free , and so we 've got to take a hand in this affair . The least he could have done was to go his way ; not come back here to defy the self-respecting people of this neighborhood . I move we give ' em two weeks ? the . pair of ' em  --  to fix up their belongings and wind up their affairs and move away . I do n't want to hurry ' em unseemly , but they 've got to go . " The Bohemian agreed to the proposal , but all the others dissented . " Two hours you mean , " said the man from the West . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number . The ena of it was that the unanimous decision was reached to send a committee of ten to Mrs. Nelson and Swartz to-day , and to keep together a committee of 100 , equipped with feathers and a tar pot , to " see ' em to the train , " if that becomes necessary . At the trial of Swartz in Riverhead Mrs. Nelson and her daughter failed to tell anything of a quarrel that was supposed by the neighbors to have preceded the death of Nelson , while Dr : George A. Ferguson of Brooklyn , after testifying that stains found on Swartz 's clothes were blood stains , was forced to admit on cross-examination that he , did not know what kind-of stains the blood of a Long Island deer would make .
