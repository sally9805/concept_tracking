BY the time we joined my father , he had surveyed many avenues of approach toward the coveted citadel of fortune . One of these , heretofore untried , he now proposed to essay , armed with new courage , and cheered on by the presence of his family . In partnership with an energetic little man who had an English chapter in his history , he prepared to set up a refreshment booth on Crescent Beach . But while he was completing arrangements at the beach we remained in town , where we enjoyed the educational advantages of a thickly populated neighborhood , namely , Wall Street , in the West End of Boston . Anybody who knows Boston knows that the West and North ends are the wrong ends of that city . They form the tenement district , or , in the newer phrase , the slums of Boston . Anybody who is acquainted with the slums of any American metropolis knows that that is the quarter where poor immigrants foregather , to live , for the most part , as unkempt , half-washed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social missionaries , the despair of boards of health , the hope of ward politicians , the touchstone of American democracy . The well-versed metropolitan knows the slums as a sort of house of detention for poor aliens , where they live on probation till they can show a certificate of good citizenship . He may know all this and yet not guess how Wall Street , in the West End , appears in the eyes of a little immigrant from Polotzk . What would the sophisticated sightseer say about Union Place , off Wall Street , where my new home waited for me ? He would say that it is no place at all , but a short box of an alley . Two rows of three-story tenements are its walls , a stingy strip of sky is its lid , a littered pavement is the floor , and a narrow mouth its exit . But I saw a very different picture on my introduction to Union Place . I saw two imposing rows of brick buildings , loftier than any dwelling I had ever lived in . Brick was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of common earth , or boards . Many friendly windows stood open , filled with uncovered heads of women and children . I thought the people were interested in us , which was very neighborly . I looked up to the topmost row of windows , and my eyes were filled with the May blue of an American sky ! In our days of affluence in Russia , we had been accustomed to upholstered parlors , embroidered linen , silver spoons and candlesticks , goblets of gold , kitchen shelves shining with copper and brass . We had feather-beds heaped half-way to the ceiling ; we had clothes-presses dusky with velvet and silk and fine woolen . The three small rooms into which my father now ushered us , up one flight of stairs , contained only the necessary beds , with lean mattresses ; a few wooden chairs ; a table or two ; a mysterious iron.structore , which later turned out to be a stove ; a couple of unornamental kerosene lamps ; and a scanty array of cooking utensils and crockery . And yet we were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not only because we had just passed through our seven lean years , cooking in earthen vessels , eating black bread on holidays , and wearing cotton ; it was chiefly because these wooden chairs and tin pans were American chairs and pans that they shone glorious in our eyes . Our initiation into American ways began with the first step on the new soil . My father found occasion to in struct or correct us even on the way from the pier to Wall Street , which journey we made crowded together in a rickety cab . He told us not to lean out of the windows , not to point , and explained the word ' greenhorn . ' We did not want to be greenhorns , and gave the strictest attention to my father 's instructions . I do not know when my parents found opportunity to review together the history of Polotzk in the three years past , for we children had no patience for the subject : my mother 's narrative was constantly interrupted by irrelevant questions , interjections , and explanations . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father produced several kinds of food , ready to eat , without any cooking , from little tin cans that had printing all over them . He attempted to introduce us to a queer , slippery kind of fruit , which he called ' banana , ' but had to give it up for the time being . After the meal , he had better luck with a curious piece of furniture on runners , which he called ' rocking chair . ' There were five of us newcomers , and we found five different ways of getting into the American vehicle of perpetual motion , and as many ways of getting out of it . In our flat we did not think of such a thing as storing the coal in the bathtub . There was no bathtub . So in the evening of the first day my father conducted us to the public baths . As we moved along in a little procession , I was delighted with the illumination of the streets . So many lamps , and they burned until morning , my father said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In America , then , everything was free , as we had heard in Russia . Light was free ; the streets were as bright as a synagogue on a holy-day . Music was free ; we had been serenaded , to our gaping delight , by a brass band of many pieces , soon after our installation on Union Place . Education was free . That subject my father had written about repeatedly , as comprising his chief hope for us children , the essence of American opportunity , the treasure that no thief could touch , not even misfortune or poverty . It was the one thing that he was able to promise us when he sent for us , surer , safer than bread or shelter . On our second day I was thrilled with the realization of what this freedom of education meant . A little girl from across the alley came and offered to conduct us to school . My father was out , but we five between us had a few words of English by this time . We knew the word school . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till yesterday , who could not pronounce our names , who was not much better dressed than we , was able to offer us the freedom of the schools of Boston ! No application made , no questions asked , no examinations , rulings , exclusions ; no machinations , no fees . The doors stood open for every one of us . The smallest child could show us the way . This incident impressed me more than anything I had heard in advance of the freedom of education in America . It was a concrete proof ? almost the thing itself . One had to experience it to understand it . It was a great disappointment to be told by my father that we were not to enter upon our school career at once . It was too near the end of the term , he said , and we were going to move to Crescent Beach in a week or so . We had to wait until the opening of the schools in September . What a loss of precious time ? from May till Sep-tember ! Not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union Place was crowded with lessons and experiences . We had to visit the stores and be dressed from head to foot in American clothing ; we had to conquer the mysteries of the iron stove , the washboard , and the speaking-tube ; we had to learn to trade with the fruit-peddler through the window , and not to be afraid of the policeman ; and , above all , we had to learn English . The kind people who assisted us in these important matters form a group by themselves in the gallery of my friends . If I had never seen them from those early days till now , I should still have remembered them with gratitude . When I enumerate the long list of my American teachers , I must begin with those who came to us on Union Place and taught us our first steps . To my mother , in her perplexity over the cook-stove , the woman who showed her how to make the fire was an angel of deliverance . A fairy godmother to us children was she who led us to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dazzlingly beautiful palace called a ' department store , ' we exchanged our hateful home-made European costumes , which pointed us out as greenhorns ' to the children on the street , for real American machine-made garments , and issued forth glorified in each others ' eyes . With our despised immigrant clothing we shed also our impossible Hebrew names . A committee of our friends , several years ahead of us in American experience , put their heads together and concocted American names for us all . Those of our real names that had no pleasing American equivalents they ruthlessly discarded , content if they retained the initials . My mother , possessing a name that was untranslatable , was punished with the undignified nickname of Annie . Fetchke , Joseph , and Edle Dvereh issued as Frieda , Joseph , and Dora , respectively . As for poor me , I was simply cheated . My Hebrew name being Maryashe in full , ? Mashke for short , ? Russianized into Marya ( Mar-ya ) , my friends said it would hold good in English as Mary ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a really strange-sounding American name like the others . I am forgetting the consolation I had , in this matter of names , from the use of my surname , which I have had no occasion to mention until now . My father , I found on my arrival , was Mr. Antin on the slightest provocation , and not , as in Polotzk , on state occasions alone . And so I was Mary Antin , and I felt very important to answer to such a dignified title . It was just like America that even , plain people should wear their surnames on week-days . As a family we were so diligent under instruction , so adaptable , and so clever in hiding our deficiencies , that when we made the journey to Crescent Beach , in the wake of our small wagonload of household goods , my father had very little occasion to admonish us on the way , and I am sure he was not ashamed of us . So much we had achieved toward our Americanization during the two weeks that had passed since our landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun set and rose , and I did not feel the earth rushing through space . But I lay stretched out in the sun , my eyes level with the sea , till I seemed to be absorbed bodily by the very materials of the world around me ; till I could not feel my hand as separate from the warm sand in which it was buried . Or I crouched on the beach at full moon , wondering , wondering , between the two splendors of the sky and the sea . I ran out to meet the incoming storm , my face full in the wind , my being a-tingle with an awful delight to the tips of my fog-matted locks flying behind ; and stood clinging to some stake or upturned boat , shaken by the roar and rumble of the waves . So clinging , I pretended that I was in danger , and was deliciously frightened ; I held on with both hands , and shook my head , exulting in the tumult around me , equally ready to laugh or sob . Or else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the sea , not looking at all , but just listening to the rustle of the waves on the sand ; not thinking at all , but just breathing with the sea . My father 's little partner , Mr. Wilner , had a large family of boys , girls , twins , and everything else in the way of children . There were no fewer than twelve little Wilners , some of whom were splendid playfellows . Together we romped on the beach , or disported ourselves like mermen and mermaids in the surf , the while our respective fathers dispensed cold lemonade , hot peanuts , and pink popcorn , and piled up our respective fortunes , nickel by nickel , penny by penny . I was very proud of my connection with the public life of the beach . I admired greatly our shining soda fountain , the rows of sparkling glasses , the pyramids of oranges , the sausage chains , the neat white counter , and the bright array of tin spoons . It seemed to me that none of the other refreshment stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought my father looked very well in a long white apron and shirt sleeves . He dished out ice cream with enthusiasm , so I supposed he was getting rich . It never occurred to me to compare his present occupation with the position of a rabbi , for which he had been originally destined ; or if I thought about it , I was just as well content , for by this time I had by heart my father 's saying , ' America is not Polotzk . ' All occupations were respectable , all men were equal , in America . If I admired the soda fountain and the sausage chains , I almost worshiped the partner , Mr. Wilner . I was content to stand for an hour at a time watching him make potato chips . In his cook 's cap and apron , with a ladle in his hand and a smile on his face , he moved about with the greatest agility , whisking his raw materials out of nowhere , dipping into his bubbling kettle with a flourish , and bringing forth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be had anywhere else on Crescent Beach . Thin as tissue paper , crisp as dry snow , and salt as the sea ? such thirst-producing , lemonade-selling , nickel-bringing potato chips only Mr. Wilner could make . On holidays , when dozens of family parties came out by every train from town , he could hardly keep up with the demand for his potato chips . And with a waiting crowd around him our partner was at his best . He was as voluble as he was skillful , and as witty as he was voluble ; at least so I guessed from the laughter that frequently drowned his voice . I could not understand his jokes , but if I could get near enough to watch his lips , and his smile , and his merry eyes , I was happy . That any one could talk so fast , and in English , was marvel enough , but that this prodigy should belong to our establishment was a fact to thrill me . I had never seen anything like Mr. Wilner , except a wedding jester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was I of the talent and good taste displayed at our stand , that if my father beckoned to me in the crowd , and sent me on an errand , I hoped the people noticed that I , too , was connected with the establishment . And all this splendor and glory and distinction came to a sudden end . There was some sort of trouble about a license ? some fee or fine ? there was a storm in the night that damaged the soda fountain and other fixtures ? there was talk and consultation between the houses of Antin and Wilner ? and the promising partnership was dissolved . No more would the merry partner gather the crowd on the beach ; no more would a dozen Wilners gambol like mermen and mermaids in the surf . And the less numerous tribe of Antin must also say farewell to the jolly seaside life ; for men in such humble business as my father 's carry their families , along with their other earthly goods , wherever they go , after the manner of the gypsies . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic , in conspiracy with the Sunday law , had torn it out . We must seek our luck elsewhere . In Polotzk we had supposed that America ' was practically synonymous with ' Boston . ' When we landed in Boston , the horizon was pushed back , and we annexed Crescent Beach . And now , espying other lands of promise , we took possession of the province of Chelsea , in the name of our necessity . In Chelsea , as in Boston , we made our stand in the wrong end of the town . Arlington Street was inhabited by poor Jews , poor Negroes , and a sprinkling of poor Irish . The side streets leading from it were occupied by more poor Jews and Negroes . It was a proper locality for a man without capital to do business . My father rented a tenement with a store in the basement ; he put in a few barrels of flour and sugar , a few boxes of crackers , a few gallons of kerosene , an assortment ' of soap of the ' save-the-coupon ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potatoes , and a pyramid of kindling wood ; in the show case , an alluring display of penny candy . He put out his sign , with a gilt-lettered warning , ' Strictly Cash , ' and proceeded to give credit indiscriminately . That was the regular way to do business on Arlington Street . My father in his three years ' apprenticeship , had learned the tricks of many trades : he knew when and how to bluff . ' The legend ' Strictly Cash ' was a protection against notoriously irresponsible customers ; while none of the good ' customers , who had a record for paying regularly on Saturday , hesitated to enter the store with empty purses . If my father knew the tricks of the trade , my mother could be counted on to throw all her talent and tact into the business . Of course she had no English yet ; but as she could perform the acts of weighing , measuring , and mental computation of fractions mechanically , she was able to give her whole attention to the dark mysteries of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this she made such rapid progress that she soon lost all sense of disadvantage , and conducted herself behind the counter very much as if she were back in her old store in Polotzk . It was far more cosy than Polotzk , ? at least so it seemed to me , ? for behind the store was the kitchen , where she did her cooking and washing , in the intervals of slack trade . Arlington Street customers were used to waiting while the storekeeper salted the soup or rescued a loaf from the oven . Once more Fortune favored my family with a thin little smile , and my father , in reply to a friendly inquiry , would say , ' One makes a living , ' with a shrug of the shoulders that added , but nothing to boast of . ' It was characteristic of my attitude toward bread-and-butter matters , that this contented me , and I felt free to devote myself to the conquest of my new world . I was exceedingly pleased with all I saw . My early letters to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glories of my new country . No native citizen of Chelsea took such pride and delight in its institutions as I did . It required no fifeand-drum corps , no Fourth of July procession , to set me tingling with patriotism . Even the common agents and instruments of municipal life , such as the letter-carrier or the fire-engine , I regarded with a measure of respect . I know what I thought of people who said that Chelsea was a very small , dull , una spiring town , with no discernible excuse for a separate name or existence . The apex of my civic pride and personal contentment was reached on the bright September morning when I entered the public school . That day I must always remember , even if I live to be so old that I can not tell my name . To most people their first day at school is a memorable occasion . In my case the importance of the day was a hundred times magnified , on account of the years I had waited , the road I had come , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my first day at school ? Whose hand was in mine , as I stood , overcome with awe , by the teacher 's desk , and whispered my name as my father prompted ? Was it Fetchke 's steady , capable hand ? Was it her loyal heart that throbbed , beat for beat , with mine , as it had throbbed through all our childish adventures ? Fetchke 's heart did throb that day , but not with my emotions . My heart pulsed with joy and pride and ambition ; in her heart longing fought with abnegation . For I was led to the schoolroom , with its sunshine , and its singing , and the teacher 's cheery smile ; while she was led to the workshop , with its foul air , care-lined faces , and the foreman 's stern command . Our going to school was the fulfillment of my father 's best promises to us , and Fetchke 's share was to fashion and fit the frocks in which the baby sister and I made our first appearance in a public school-room . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so affectionately did I regard it as it hung upon the wall ? my consecration robe awaiting the beatific day . And Fetchke , I am sure , remembers it , too , so longingly did she regard it as the crisp , starchy breadths of it slid between her fingers . But whatever were her longings , she said nothing of them ; she bent over the sewing machine , humming an Old-World melody . And when the momentous day arrived , and the little sister and I stood up to be arrayed , it was Fetchke herself who patted and smoothed my stiff new calico ; who made me turn round and round , to see that I was perfect ; who stooped to pull out a disfiguring basting thread . If there was anything in her heart besides sisterly love and pride and goodwill , as we parted that morning , it was a sense of loss and a woman 's acquiescence in her fate ; for we had been close friends , and now our ways would lie apart . Longing she felt , but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied . Until that morning we had been children together , but now , at the fiat of her destiny , she became a woman , with all a woman 's cares ; whilst I , so little younger than she , was bidden to dance at the May festival of untroubled childhood . Why such a difference in our lots ? Because she was she , and I was I. Fetchke 's domestic instincts , her good health and docility , had made her from childhood the support of every tottering domestic situation . As formerly she had played nurse and housemother to us younger children , so now , when my father 's utmost efforts failed to win bread and shelter for us all , she had to turn bread-winner also . My father intended no injustice toward any of his children . Fetchke was the eldest , the strongest , and the only one of legal age to be put to work . When he could not give all his children equal opportunities , he divided the world between them in accordance with the laws of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to school , with my brother and little sister . He would not have delegated that mission to the President of the United States . He had awaited the day with impatience equal to mine , and the visions he saw as he hurried us over the sun-flecked pavements transcended all my dreams . Almost his first act on landing on American soil , three years before , had been his application for naturalization . He had taken the remaining steps in the process with eager promptness , and at the earliest moment allowed by the law , he became a citizen of the United States . It is true that he had left home in search of bread for his hungry family , but he went blessing the necessity that drove him to America . The boasted freedom of the New World meant to him far more than the right to reside , travel , and work wherever he pleased : it meant the freedom to speak his thoughts , to throw off the shackles of superstition , to test his own fate , unhindered by political or religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed ? thirty-two ? and most of his life he had been held in leading strings . He was hungry for his untasted manhood . Three years passed in sordid struggle and disappointment . He was not prepared to make a living even in America , where the day-laborer eats wheat instead of rye . Apparently the American flag could not protect him against the pursuing Nemesis of his limitations ; he must expiate the sins of his fathers who slept across the seas . He had been endowed at birth with a poor constitution , a nervous , restless temperament , and an abundance of hindering prejudices . In his boyhood his body was starved that his mind might be stuffed with useless learning . In his youth this dearly-got learning was sold , and the price was the bread and salt which he had not been trained to earn for himself . Under the wedding canopy he was bound for life to a girl whose features were still strange to him ; and he was bidden to multiply himself , that sacred learning might be perpetuated in his sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All this while he had been led about as a creature without a will , a chattel , an instrument . In his maturity he awoke , and found himself poor in health , poor in purse , poor in useful knowledge , and hampered on all sides . At the first nod of opportunity he broke away from his prison , and strove to atone for his wasted youth by a life of useful labor ; while at the same time he sought to enlighten the gloom of his narrow scholarship by freely partaking of modern ideas . But his utmost endeavor still left him far from his goal . In business , nothing prospered with him . Some fault of hand or mind or temperament led him to failure where other men found success . Wherever the blame for his disabilities be placed , he reaped their bitter fruit . ' Give me bread ! ' he cried to America . ' What will you do to earn it ? ' the challenge came back . And he found that he was master of no art , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no avail , because he had only the most antiquated methods of Communicating it . So in his primary quest he had failed . There was left him the compensation of intellectual freedom . That he sought to realize in every possible way . He had very little opportunity to prosecute his education , which , in truth , had never been begun . His struggle for a bare living left him no time to take advantage of the public evening school ; but he lost nothing of what was to be learned through reading , through attendance at public meetings , through exercising the rights of citizenship . Even here he was hindered by a natural inability to acquire the English language . In time , indeed , he learned to read , to follow a conversation or lecture ; but he never learned to write correctly , and his pronunciation remains extremely foreign to this day . If education , culture , the higher life , were shining things to be worshiped from afar , he had still a means left whereby he could draw one step nearer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn all those things that he knew by fame to be desirable . The common school , at least , perhaps high school ; for one or two , even college ! His children should be students , and fill his house with books and intellectual company ; and thus he would walk by proxy in the Elysian fields of liberal learning . As for the children themselves , he knew no surer way to their advancement and happiness . So it was with a heart full of longing and hope that my father led us to school on that first day . He took long strides in his eagerness , the rest of us running and hopping to keep up . At last the four of us stood around the teacher 's desk ; and my father , in his impossible English , gave us over in her charge , with some broken word of his hopes for us that his swelling heart could no longer contain . I venture to say that Miss Nixon was struck by something uncommon in the group we made , something outside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My little sister was as pretty as a doll , with her clear pink-andwhite face , short golden curls , and eyes like blue violets , when you caught them looking up . My brother might have been a girl , too , with his cherubic contour of face , rich red color , glossy black hair , and fine eyebrows . Whatever secret fears were in his heart , remembering his former teachers , who had taught with the rod , he stood up straight and uncringing before the American teacher , his cap respectfully doffed . Next to him stood a starved-looking girl with eyes ready to pop out , and short dark curls that would not have made much of a wig for a Jewish bride . All three children carried themselves rather better than the common run of green ' pupils that were brought to Miss Nixon . But the figure that challenged attention to the group was the tall , straight father , with his earnest face and fine forehead , nervous hands eloquent in gesture , and a voice full of feeling . This foreigner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were an act of consecration , who regarded the teacher of the primer class with reverence , who spoke of visions , like a man inspired , in a common schoolroom , was not like other aliens , who brought their children in dull obedience to the law ; was not like the native fathers , who brought their unmanageable boys , glad to be relieved of their care . I think Miss Nixon guessed what my father 's best English could not convey . I think she divined that by the simple act of delivering our school certificates to her he took possession of America . IV I was not a bit too large for my little chair and desk in the baby class at school , but my mind , of course , was too mature by six or seven years for the work . So as soon as I could understand what the teacher said in class , I was advanced to the second grade . This was within a week after Miss Nixon took me in hand . But I do not mean to give my dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even half the credit . On behalf of my race and my family , I shall divide it with her . I was Jew enough to have an aptitude for language in general , and to bend my mind earnestly to my task ; I was Antin enough to read each lesson with my heart , which gave me an inkling of what was coming next , and so carried me along by leaps and bounds . As for the teacher , she could best explain what theory she followed in teaching us foreigners to read . I can only describe the method , which was so simple that I wish holiness could be taught in the same way . There were about half a dozen of us beginners in English , in age from six to fifteen . Miss Nixon made a special class of us , and aided us so skillfully and earnestly in our endeavors to ' seea-cat , ' and ' hear-a-dog , ' and look-at the-hen , ' that we turned over page after page of the ravishing history , eager to find out how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange speech . The teacher knew just when to let us help each other out with a word in our own tongue , ? it happened that we were all Jews , ? and so , working all together , we actually covered more ground in a lesson than the native classes , composed entirely of the little tots . But we stuck ? stuck fast ? at the definite article ; and sometimes the lesson resolved itself into a species of lingual gymnastics , in which we all looked as if we meant to bite off our tongues . Miss Nixon was pretty , and she must have looked well with her white teeth showing in the act ; but at the time I was too solemnly occupied to admire her looks . I did take great pleasure in her smile of approval , whenever I pronounced well ; and her patience and perseverance in struggling with us over that thick little word are becoming to her even now , after fifteen years . It is not her fault if any of us to-day give a buzzing sound to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help me over my private difficulties , my gratitude went out to them , silently . It meant so much to me that they halted the lesson to give me a lift , that I needs must love them for it . Dear Miss Carrot , of the second grade , would be amazed to hear what small things I remember , all because I was so impressed at the time with her readiness and sweetness in taking notice of my difficulties . Says Miss Carrol , looking straight at me , If Johnnie has three marbles , and Charlie has twice as many , how many marbles has Charlie ? ' I raise my hand for permission to speak . ' Teacher , I do n't know what is tvice . ' Teacher beckons me to her , and whispers in my ear the meaning of the strange word , and I am able to write the sum correctly . It 's all in the day 's work with her ; with me , it is a special act of kindness and efficiency . She whom I found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hardly name her with the rest , though I mention none of them lightly . Her approval was always dear to me , first because she was Teacher , and afterwards , as long as she lived , because she was my Miss Dillingham . Great was my grief , therefore , when , shortly after my admission to her class , I incurred discipline , for the first , and next to the last , time in my school career . The class was repeating in chorus the Lord 's Prayer , heads bowed on desks . I was doing my best to keep up by the sound ; my mind could not go beyond the word ' hallowed , ' for which I had not found the meaning . In the middle of the prayer the Jewish boy across the aisle trod on my foot to get my attention . ' You must not say that , ' he admonished in a solemn whisper . It 's Christian . ' I whispered back that it was n't , and went on , to the ' Amen . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the name of Christ was not in the prayer , and I was bound to do everything that the class did . If I had any Jewish scruples , they were lagging away behind my interest in school affairs . But all Miss Dillingham saw was that two of her pupils whispered during morning prayer , and she must discipline them . So I was degraded from the honor row to the lowest row , and it was many a day before I forgave that young missionary ; it was not enough for my vengeance that he suffered punishment with me . Teacher , of course , heard us both defend ourselves , but there was a time and a place for religious arguments , and she meant to help us remember that point . If I was eager and diligent , my teachers did not sleep . As fast as my knowledge of English allowed , they advanced me from grade to grade , without reference to the usual schedule of promotions . My father was right when he often said , in discussing my prospects , that ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as was my progress , on account of the advantages with which I started , some of the other green ' pupils were not far behind me : within a grade or two , by the end of the year . My brother , whose whole childhood had been one hideous nightmare , what with the stupid rebbe , the cruel whip , and the general repression of life in the Pale , surprised my father by the progress he made under intelligent , sympathetic guidance . Indeed , he soon had a reputation in the school that the American boys envied ; and all through the school course he more than held his own with pupils of his age . So much for the right and wrong way of doing things . There is a record of my early progress in English much better than my recollections , however accurate and definite these may be . I have several reasons for introducing it here . First , it shows what the Russian Jew can do with an adopted language ; next , it proves that vigilance of our public-school teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud of it ! That is an unnecessary confession , but I could not be satisfied to insert the record here , with my vanity unavowed . This is the document , copied from an educational journal , a tattered copy of which lies in my lap as I write ? treasured for fifteen years , you see , by my vanity . Editor Primary Education : This is the uncorrected paper of a Russian child twelve years old , who had studied English only four months . She had never , until September , been to school even in her own country and has heard English spoken only at school . I shall be glad if the paper of my pupil and the above explanation may appear in your paper . M. S. is coming down in feather-flakes , which makes nice snowballs . But there is still one kind of snow more . This kind of snow is called snow-crystals , for it comes down in little curly balls . These snow crystals are n't quiet as good for snow-balls as feather-flakes , for they ( the snow-crystals ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feather-flakes do . The snow is dear to some children - for they like sleighing . As I said at the top ? the snow comes from the clouds . Now the trees are bare , no flowers are to see in the fields and gardens , ( we all know why ) and the whole world seems like asleep without the happy birds songs which left us till spring . But the snow which drove away all these pretty and happy things , try ( as I think ) not to make us at all unhappy ; they covered up the branches of the trees , the fields , the gardens and houses , and the whole world looks like dressed in a beautiful white ? instead of green ? dress , with the sky looking down on it with a pale face . And so the people can find some joy in it , too , without the happy summer . MARY ANTIN . And now that it stands there , with her name over it , I am ashamed of my flippant talk about vanity . More to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the conquest of fifty languages , is the association of this dear friend with my earliest efforts at writing ; and it pleases me to remember that to her I owe my very first appearance in print . Vanity is the least part of it , when I remember how she called me to her desk , one day after school wasout , and showed me my composition ? my own words , that I had written out of my own head ? printed out , clear black and white , with my name at the end ! Nothing so wonderful had ever happened to me before . My whole consciousness was suddenly transformed . I suppose that was the moment when I became a writer . I always loved to write , ? I wrote letters whenever I had an excuse , ? but it had never occurred to me to sit down and write my thoughts for no person in particular , merely to put the world on paper . But now , as I read my own words , in a delicious confusion , the idea was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was that really I ? The printed characters composing it seemed strange to me all of a sudden . If that was my name , and those were the words out of my own head , what relation did it all have to me , who was alone there with Miss Dillingham , and the printed page between us ? Why , it meant that I could write again , and see my writing printed , and ? and give it to people to read ! I could write many , many things : I could ' write a book ! The idea was so huge , so bewildering , that my mind scarcely could accommodate it . I never heard of any one who was so watched and coaxed , so passed along from hand to helping hand , as was I. I always had friends . They sprang up everywhere , as if they had stood waiting for me to come . So here was my teacher , the moment she saw that I could give a good paraphrase of her talk on ' Snow , ' bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day she asked me if I had ever written poetry . I had not , but I went home and tried . I believe it was more Snow , and I know it was wretched . Wretched it was ; worse , a great deal , than reams of poetry that is written by children about whom there is no fuss made . But Miss Dillingham was not discouraged . She saw that I had no idea of metre , so she proceeded to teach me . We repeated miles of poetry together , smooth lines that sang themselves , mostly out of Longfellow . Then I would go home and write ? oh , about the snow in our back yard ! ? but when Miss Dillingham came to read my verses , they limped , and they lagged , and they dragged , and there was no tune that would fit them . At last came the moment of illumination : I saw where- my trouble lay . I had supposed that my lines matched when they had an equal number of syllables , taking no account of accent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry ! The everlasting snow melted at last , and the mud-puddles dried in the spring sun , and the grass on the common was green , and still I wrote poetry ! Again I wish I had some example of my springtime rhapsodies : the veriest rubbish of the sort that ever a child perpetrated . Lizzie McDee , who had red hair and freckles , and a Sunday-school manner on weekdays , and was below me in the class , did a great deal better . We used to compare verses ; and while I do not remember that I ever had the grace to own that she was the better poet , I do know that I secretly wondered why the teachers did not invite her to stay after school and study poetry , while they took so much pains with me . But so it was always with me : somebody did something for me all the time . About the middle of the year I was promoted to the grammar school . Then it was that I walked on air . For I said to myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not merely a school girl learning to spell and cipher . I was going to learn out-of-the-way things , things that had nothing to do with ordinary life ? things to know . When I walked home afternoons , with the great big geography book under my arm , it seemed to me that the earth was conscious of my step . Sometimes I carried home half the books in my desk , not because I should need them , but because I loved to hold them ; and also because I loved to be seen carrying books . It was a badge of scholarship , and I was proud of it . I remembered the days in Vitebsk when I used to watch my cousin Hirshel start for school in the morning , every thread of his student 's uniform , every worn copybook in his satchel , glorified in my envious eyes . And now I was myself as he ; aye , greater than he : for I knew English , and I could write poetry . The public school has done its best for us foreigners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into good Americans . I am glad it is mine to tell how the miracle was wrought in one case . You should be glad to hear of it , you born Americans ; for it is the story of the growth of your country ; of the flocking of your brothers and sisters from the far ends of the earth to the flag you love ; of the recruiting of your armies of workers , thinkers , and leaders . And you will be glad to hear of it , my comrades in adoption ; for it is a rehearsal of your own experience , the thrill and wonder of which your own hearts have felt . How long would you say , wise reader , it takes to make an American ? By the middle of my second year in school I had reached the sixth grade . When , after the Christmas holidays , we began to study the life of Washington , running through a summary of the Revolution , and the early days of the Republic , it seemed to me that all my reading and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arithmetic , the song-book , that had so fascinated me until now , turned suddenly into sober exercise books , tools wherewith to hew a way to the source of inspiration . When the teacher read to us out of a big book with many bookmarks in it , I sat rigid with attention in my little chair , my hands tightly clasped on the edge of my desk ; and I painfully held my breath , to prevent sighs of disap. pointment escaping , as I saw the teacher skip the parts between bookmarks . When the class read , and it came my turn , my voice shook and the book trembled in my hands . I could not pronounce the name of George Washington without a pause . Never had I prayed , never had I chanted the songs of David , never had I called upon the Most Holy , in such utter reverence and worship as I pronounced the simple sentences of my child 's story of the patriot . I gazed with adoration at the portraits of George and Martha Washington , till I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formerly my self-consciousness had bordered on conceit , and I thought myself an uncommon person , parading my school-books through the streets , and swelling with pride when a teacher detained me in conversation , now I grew humble all at once , seeing how insignificant I was beside the Great . As I read about the noble boy who would not tell a lie to save himself from punishment , I was for the first time truly repentant of my sins . For- ' merly I had fasted and prayed and made sacrifice on the Day of Atonement , but it was more than half play , in mimicry of my elders . I had no real horror of sin , and I knew so many ways of escaping punishment . I am sure my relatives , my neighbors , my teachers in Polotzk ? all my world , in fact ? strove together , by example and precept , to teach me goodness . Saintliness had a new incarnation in about every third person I knew . I did respect the saints , but I could not help seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that mischief was much more fun than piety . Goodness , as I had known it , was respectable , but not necessarily admirable . The people I really admired , like my Uncle Solomon , and Cousin Rachel , were those who preached the least and laughed the most . My sister Fetchke was perfectly good , but she did not think the less of me because I played tricks . What I loved in my friends was not inimitable . One could be downright good if one really wanted to . One could be learned if one had books and teachers . One could sing funny songs , and tell anecdotes , if one traveled about and picked up such things , like one 's uncles and cousins . But a human being strictly good , perfectly wise , and unfailingly valiant , all at the same time , I had never heard or dreamed of . This wonderful George Washington was as inimitable as he was irreproachable . Even if I had never , never told a lie , I could not compare myself to George Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go out when snow-balls whizzed ? and I could never be the First President of the United States . So I was forced to revise my own estimate of myself . But the twin of my newborn humility , paradoxical as it may seem , was a sense of dignity I had never known before . For if I found that I was a person of small consequence , I discovered at the same time that I was more nobly related than I had ever supposed . I had relatives and friends who were notable people by the old standards , ? I had never been ashamed of my family , ? but this George Washington who died long before I was born was like a king in greatness , and he and I were Fellow Citizens . There was a great deal about Fellow Citizens in the patriotic literature we read at this time ; and I knew from my father how he was a Citizen , through the process of naturalization , and how I also was a Citizen , by virtue of my relation to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was another . I was thrilled when I realized what sudden greatness had fallen on me ; and at the same time I was sobered , as with a sense of responsibility . I strove to conduct myself as befitted a Fellow Citizen . Before books came into my life , I was given to star-gazing and daydreaming . When books were given me , I fell upon them as a glutton pounces on his meat , after a period of enforced starvation . I lived with my nose in a book , and took no notice of the alternations of the sun and stars . But now , after the advent of George Washington and the American Revolution , I began to dream again . I strayed on the common after school instead of hurrying home to read . I hung on fence-rails , my pet book forgotten under my arm , and gazed off to the February sunset , and beyond , and beyond . I was no longer the central figure of my dreams : the dry weeds in the lane crackled beneath the tread of Heroes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much morel As I read how the patriots planned the Revolution , and the women gave their sons to die in battle , and the heroes led to victory , and the rejoicing people set up the Republic , it dawned on me gradually what was meant by my country . The people all desiring noble things , and striving for them together , defying their oppressors , giving their lives for each other ? all this it was that made my country . It was not a thing that I understood ; I could not go home and tell Fetchke about it , as I told her other things I learned at school . But I knew one could say ' my country ' and feel it , as one felt ' God ' or ' myself . ' My teacher , my schoolmates , Miss Dillingham , George Washington himself , could not mean more than I when they said my country , after I had once felt it . For the Country was for all the Citizens , and I was a Citizen . And when we stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words with all my might . I was in very earnest proclaiming to the world my love for my newfound country . ' I love thy rocks and rills , Thy woods and templed hills . ' Boston Harbor , Crescent Beach , Chelsea Square ? all was hallowed ground to me . As the day approached when the school was to hold exercises in honor of Washington 's Birthday , the halls resounded at all hours with the strains of patriotic songs ; and I , who was a model of the attentive pupil , more than once lost my place in the lesson , as I strained to hear , through closed doors , some neighboring class rehearsing ' The Star-Spangled Banner . ' If the doors happened to open , and the chorus broke out unveiled , delicious tremors ran up and down my spine , and I was faint with suppressed enthusiasm . Where had been my country until now ? What flag had I loved ? what heroes had I worshiped ? Even the very names of these things had been unknown to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was Goluth ? exile . On many occasions in the year we prayed to God to lead us out of exile . The beautiful Passover service closed with the words , ' Next year , may we be in Jerusalem . ' Still , on childish lips , those words were no conscious aspiration ; we repeated the Hebrew syllables after our elders , but without their hope and longing . Not that any child among us was too young to feel in his own flesh the lash of the oppressor . We knew what it was to be Jews in exile , from the spiteful treatment we suffered at the hands of the smallest urchin who crossed himself ; and thence we knew that Israel had good reason to pray for deliverance . Still , the story of the Exodus was not history to me in the sense that the story of the American Revolution was . It was more like a glorious myth , a belief in which had the effect of cutting me off from the actual world by linking me with a world of phantoms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past afforded us , allowing us to call ourselves the children of princes , served but to tinge with a more poignant sense of disinheritance the long humdrum stretches of our life . In very truth we were a people without a country . Surrounded by mocking foes and detractors , it was difficult for me to realize the persons of my people 's heroes or the events in which they moved . Except in moments of abstraction from the world around me , I scarcely understood that Jerusalem was an actual spot on the earth , where once the Kings of the Bible , real people , like my neighbors in Polotzk , ruled in puissant majesty . For the conditions of our civil life did not permit us to cultivate a spirit of nationalism . The freedom of worship that Was grudgingly granted within the narrow limits of the Pale by no means included the right to set up openly any ideal of a Hebrew State , any hero other than the Czar . What we children picked up of our ancient political history was confused with the miraculous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazy associations of Bible lore . As to our future , we Jews in Polotzk had no national expectations ; only as individuals we dreamed of America , as of a place of refuge . If Fetchke and I sang , with my father , first making sure of our audience , Zion , Zion , Holy Zion , not forever is it lost , ' we did not really picture to ourselves Judaea , restored . So it came to pass that we did not know what my country could mean to a man . And as we had no country , so we had no flag to love . It was by no farfetched symbolism that the banner of the House of Romanoff became the emblem of our latter-day bondage in our eyes . Even a child would know how to hate the flag that we were forced , on pain of severe penalties , to hoist above our housetops , in celebration of the advent of one of our oppressors . And as it was with country and flag , so it was with heroes of war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last brass button . On the person of a Gentile , it was the symbol of tyranny ; on the person of a Jew , it was the emblem of shame . So a little Jewish girl in Polotzk was apt to grow up hungry-minded and empty-hearted ; and if , still in her outreaching youth , she was set down in a land of outspoken patriotism , she was likely to love her new country with a great love , and to embrace its heroes in a great worship . Naturalization , with us Russian Jews , may mean more than the adoption of . the immigrant by America : it may mean the adoption of America by the immigrant .
