I le mariage n'existait pas it faudrait l'inventer is a legitimate parody of an old French saying , for marriage , that most abused institution , does respond to elementary needs , and it is difficult to conceive a world where the relationships of the two sexes could be evanescent . But we are not here concerned with the course that marriage must travel so as to be garnished for the new times ; rather must we consider that it is one of the fixed stars of our social system , a star that should shine as Venus , yet often glowers as Saturn or blazes as Mars . Thus we need to accept it as it is , a perishable bond , and ask ourselves how we can strengthen it , leaving it yet Eight as a daisy chain " Bond , " " chain , " perhaps these are improper words , and maybe that already I wander a path of thorn that should be of primrose ; perhaps the creator of the phrase " marriage bond " did as great disservice to mankind as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentimentalist who conceived " wedded bliss , " both of them passionate and excessive men . Indeed , I believe that the word " bond " embodies falsity ; none are bound save those who should never have been linked , and in that word " link " doubtless lies the civilized conception of matrimony . Other attitudes , still common that of surrender , that of conquest , that of ownership ? are purely neolithic ; it seems that the current fret against marriage arises not only from the unfitness of marriage for modern men , but also from the unfitness of modern men for modern marriage . Too many enter upon this great adventure with incredible lightness . In most revues and musical come-dies a young couple meet in some hotel garden , " fall in love , " and are married in the last act . Charge me not with lackof humor if I suggest that many marriages are so made . In my note-books are several confessions . Among them is that of a young girl who pledged her hand on board a liner because there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could have jumped overboard . ) People do marry as casually as they learn to play golf ; but they take more pains with golf . In that negligence hides the nightmare that shall haunt them ; they blunder into marriage ; they think to conduct it without travail or diplomacy into the detachment of mature years . Therein they go astray , for marriage is a tool with many edges , and none shall use it with impunity that treat it without regard . For it may close as many doors as it can open . That marriage can close doors none should deny , and it is folly to overlook its limitations , notably those which bear on individual freedom . No skill or tolerance can make of marriage a state akin to celibacy , and it is well to agree that the married are not free people in the sense of the unwed ; this is not a reflection on the conjugal condition , for freedom is a word , and Silvio Pellico in the Spielberg found wings for his spirit that no Austrian peasant could fasten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be derelict , and as in marriage such dereliction seldom arises , the loss is undamning to the state . But the married must , after the ceremony , realize " that they have this day lit a candle which can not be put out " ; accepting a new condition , they must be ready to adopt new manners , which is not easy when creatures are adult , differently bred and nurtured , perhaps rooted out of dissimilar social strata , even brought together across continents . They must abandon the idea that they may , unchecked , change their dwelling , their occupation , the circle of their friendships ; all these things they may still do , but only in consultation . Or if they do not consult , if one imposes upon the other his will or the thrall of a nagging tongue , then shall victory turn as dust and ashes in his mouth . Leaving aside joint habits that affect lodging , dwelling , such like material symbols , the main achievement is that of common thought ; a couple usually begin as playfellows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I " can be absorbed within " We . " I do not by this mean that either should sink his or her individuality , for the penalty is dullness ; along that road lies the tragedy of Tchekoff 's Olenka , who ended by never having an idea unless she could obtain one from a creature she loved . No , the health of marriage does not prosper when two people hold the same opinion , but only when two people weigh it together . As they are likely somewhat to differ , and as nuptials can not be converted into debates , they must be ready to compromise ? at the price of a little of that golden dust which falls from freedom 's wings . Notably they must forego adventure , in the exquisite as well as in the vulgar sense ; there is no more room for romantic but indiscriminate loves , no more hungry search , no more anticipation or excitement ; if the marriage is to succeed , then must each have discovered Canaan and be content with its milk and honey . Adventure is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part . But this does not mean that all color has gone out of life . Mr. Bertrand Russell says that you can kill a passion only through another passion ; if we apply to marriage this profound idea , it would seem that for adventure the couple must substitute the harmonious play of mutual understanding . Mutual understanding is not easily defined , for it must attain much more than a knowledge of each other 's fads and oddities ; it serves a couple little to discover each other 's politics , theatrical preferences , or liability to colds in the head . Nor is it restricted to sympathy , in the common sense of the word ; to echo the trite suggestion that one should share woes but not grumbles does not carry one far enough . As nearly as possible mutual understanding exists when a couple maintain an everlasting curiosity of each other 's feelings and thus enter into an Vot . CXXXVII. ? No. 822. - 100 unexplored field , rich in adventure undefiled ? the discovery of each other 's spirit . The key to mutual discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bond of lovers , yet different . During courtship the bond of lovers is a fiery tie that smolders away , and it is the work of marriage to weave another strand that shall hold when the mates have burned through the early bond . It is impossible to keep up courtship in marriage , but i it is possible to substitute a courtship of another kind ; the early courtship can not subsist , because the charm mainly consists in a in to discover and con-quer , while n marriage the discoveries are not obvious to the meaner eye and conquest is deemed done . So courtship is transformed . Often the process is cruel and disillusioning , amounts to an inept assumption that all barriers are broken down , that two people , strangers a year before , have no mysteries to unfold . It is a strange assumption . Year after year men return to the town of their birth , or again and again read the same book , finding always a different satisfaction , and yet they think to have exhausted the impressions their wives can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . A man of forty is not the man he was at twenty ; if through twenty years he is moved by the same pumpkin-patch , it is not because the pumpkin-patch is giving him the " good old " sensations , but because it is giving him brand-new sensations meet for his present age . ) When marriage is successful , courtship evolves into the intimate understanding bred of habit and joint interest ; when marriage is ideal , courtship evolves into community of emotion . But for this an almost wilful process must be favored ; the young couple enter life as Camaralzaman and Badoura , amazed by the delight of mutual association , and tend to stress that side . Because they have secured each other they tend to be content with that particular conquest and do not suspect that when it has become habitual it will cease to satisfy ; during courtship the equilibrium of their relations has been disturbed by a too exclusive focusing on mutual conquest . It is the business of marriage to restore that equilibrium . In short , two people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn into friends . This does not at all amount to saying that marriage is a cure for love ; rather is it , in the sense of Mr. Bergson , the channel that shall convert an unruly torrent into a broad , flowing river . In one sense only must marriage act as a cure for the vulgar definition of love ; that is in the sense of Sophocles as reported by Cephalus , whom Plato asked whether he did not regret youth , now that age cut him off from love . Cephalus replied that , like Sophocles , he did not regret youth ; therefore love , for age had delivered him from a fierce and furious enemy . I suspect that Cephalus had little understanding of Platonics , or he would have qualified his reply , but he spoke truly from his own point of view , probably all physical . For in conjugal love the physical must matter less than the mental ; a relation based entirely on physical attraction can neither endure nor satisfy , because " all men kill the thing they love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the previous day , while the morrow must inevitably give them less . Physical love is best served by mental hatred , ? and I need not stress that in marriage there is no room for mental hatred . If this arises the marriage must end . The wedded must recognize that marriage was specially ordained in the days of man 's innocency to relieve him of such hungers , to free him from the illusion ( which he conjured up by conceiving it ) that the conquest of another creature was the primary object of his life ; marriage enables him to say with Descartes that he thinks , therefore is , while in the thrall of physical attraction he is not capable of thought but only of will . So he arrives at the principle that shall transform courtship into marriage ; that marriage liberates him from the need to conquer . Men need to know this more than women , for women almost universally turn to the physical only if their mental side is unsated . Women accept facts in a manner more symbolic than do men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bank-check with uniform satisfaction , whatever its source , while most women appreciate it much more when it comes from one dear to them because they prize higher than the check the tribute to their power or vanity , the love feeling that prompted the gift . They are not concrete , and therefore not always easy to understand . In the marriage relation they eternally seek mental satisfactions ; they want to feel that they are understood as well as loved , that they awake curiosity , provoke cogitation , because all this is a tribute to their power . This does not reflect on them . Few human beings know happiness without sense of power , but men generally find satisfaction in the ownership of money or the control of subordinates , while women seek it in the mental interest of a particular man . If women fail to secure this they tend to desiccate mentally and in a forlorn spirit to turn to the physical side ; if , on the other hand , they are secure in the interest of a man , they easily escape from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a makeshift , a vain attempt to attain the mental bond ; if they are mentally content the physical takes , not a secondary , but the second place . So pleasant a condition can be achieved only if Daphnis and Chloe succeed in harnessing Cupid to the chariot that shall bear them until they are muted into Philemon and Baucis . Therein steps the gentlest art , which infuses love into common things . I have among my friends a husband who , while mending the harness , can look up to his wife and say , " I love you . " He is still a lover , not only because he still gives chocolates and theater stalls , but because his wife feels that all through his occupations runs his interest in her . This is the pure golden lode that lies athwart the barren country rock , and when it so outcrops , irrelevantly , she is once more assured of her importance ; she realizes that she is alive . Let no self-consciousness invade the wedded ; graceful words are as easily spoken as the churlish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then perform the examination of his or her conscience , and ask , " Am I so beautiful , so gifted , so noble that he , that she , should have chosen me ? " Except in the most arrogant humility ensues ; the one grows aware of the other 's charms and , if honest , pays them the verbal tribute that is soft as dew . Also the lover so forges a true shield , for by enhancing in his consciousness the charms of his mate he dwarfs the charms of rivals ; thus he insures against inconstancy . But the gentlest art demands of its adepts sacrifices other than humility . Mainly it demands effort . Not without labor is mutual exploration achieved , is the lovely unknown transformed into exquisite discovery ; effort , indeed , is the blood of the gentlest art , though the skilful conceal it ; effort to understand another creature presupposes a prior understanding ? the one who was worth fighting for to win is worth fighting for to retain . And much more , it demands , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to strive as hard to retain his conquest . Thus the physical , if relegated to the second place , must not be spurned ; indeed , they will fail who make no study of their power to attract and do not maintain it by the only means that give it life , by satisfying . . almost . I mean by this that self-revelation may be too brusque , and that it is well to grant it sparingly , so that always some rosy cloud of mystery may swathe the brow of the loved one . Therefore , each needs always to be the tempter by looking his or her best ; the gentlest art allows slippers , but not ugly slippers ; it demands slippers so beautiful that strangers shall wonder at them and so honor the beloved . Effort is well spent in attraction , and the pursuit of beauty is not its only weapon , for beauty needs to be crushing and rare to survive the vulgarization of daily intercourse . Each must use the natural powers given to his or her sex for the charming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , occasionally and of set purpose , he proves dictatorial , shows himself firm , if only he will take care to be right in his decision and above the cruel criticism of an intelligent woman . Likewise , if she has wisdom , she will sometimes madden and fascinate her partner by sowing in him a seed of insecurity ; a flirtation within her command will not harm her and will suggest to her partner that her eyes might turn elsewhere . This will lead him to efforts horn of jealousy , perhaps to that self-examination from which arise humility and theeffort to justify his preferment . In those simple wiles , which are those of lovers , lies the natural call of man to maid , and it will not suffer if animated by somewhat less of instinct and more of art . Art demands that both shall recognize their powers of growth . The English use in relation to marriage a horrid phrase that may be current , too , with you ; they call it " settling down . " To settle down is to me an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth , laden with hope and illusion , having shed her cargo in the ports of chance , now comes at last empty to anchorage , to rest upon a foreshore and slowly settle down into mud . Those who can use such a phrase , with all it implies of previous mean adventure , who have indeed lost their waywardness , who aspire only to sodden rest , who think to find in marriage the docks of peace and can not imagine that their last cruise may be the sweetest , are criminal and unfit ; encountering another who is full of hope , they entrap her . Woman usually pays for this " settling down , " for she always wants to settle ? up , always would live the adventure of the day as if it were her last . The gentlest art admits of no such laxities ; it bids you realize that the adventure of life ends only with life , and that , when linked with another , adventure shall arise from the fleeting kaleidoscope of that stranger 's spirit . It bids you understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty ; that she has gained and lost in charm , in intelligence ; that her interests have changed ; that her views have changed ; briefly , that she has grown . So the wedded artists will always be watchers , true romantics peering at the horizon , ready to perceive a foreign sail . Each will succeed in this if he will always consider the creature allied to him in comparison with its past , if he will foster memory and justly say : " He , she , spoke differently once upon a time , more wisely or more idly , certainly otherwise . How interesting ! I wonder why . " In this " I wonder " lies much art . The quality of wonder that is in the child too easily vanishes in the grown man as he becomes self-assured , and so age overtakes him ; for the man who has ceased to wonder what manner of life is led by his fellow-passenger in the train , who no longer paints a mental picture of the girl he meets when twenty years shall have elapsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in marriage , the one who , confronted with his partner 's singularity , no longer feels surprise , who no longer deliberately stimulates his curiosity , has whirled asunder from his mate . This execrable " settling down " into stolidity and indifference often arises from a dull life , against which the gen-tlest art is fiercely arrayed . Youth being a charm by the side of which pale both beauty and wit , the wedded artist will always strive to be young ; for this shall serve less the powder-puff and the wig than the keenness of interest and the desire to amuse ; the adept will ever be collecting facts and ideas that will please the other , present them only at suitable moments , know when . to suppress a jest that fatigue or depression makes unseemly ; he should be ready to provide , as required , domestic vaudeville or private encyclopedia , and , above all , he should know how to produce the immense restfulness of friendly silence . He will realize that pleasure must not turn into routine , and that an excursion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petits cadeaux entretiennext l'amitie ' ( et famous ) and will model himself on a husband known to me , whose wife , at every important stop between San Francisco and New York , received from his messenger a bunch of roses . The gentlest art knows nothing o mutual forgetfulness ; it insists that each shall be often , if not always , in the other 's thoughts , that entertainments shall be organized much for another and a little for self , so that contact with strangers may by contrast enhance the intimacy of the wedded pair , and , above all , so that the search-light of the public eye may encourage pride of body . Pride of body is immensely important . It is really humility masquerading as pride , for when we strive to remain physically fit , to keep our cheeks fresh , eyes bright , to dress ourselves beautifully , we confess that we are not naturally fair as Adonis and that all our energy is none too much if we are still to please . In practice pride of body means that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the mud of self-complacency and abandon thedesire to please the eyes of the familiar ; it means the reverse ? namely , that they must realize that after a while they will please less easily those familiar eyes and so must take pains tenfold ; that the time for careless ways passed away with courtship ; that marriage is a condition more critical ; indeed , that the artist courts his partner more keenly after marriage than before . Such cares as those can not be spared when the child intervenes . The child is a horrid temptation to abandon the gaieties and graces , for many men seem to feel that the child provides a wife with everlasting satisfaction , while as many women imagine that the child places a husband in their debt . The gentlest art tells both that they err , that the child is a third and free personality who must be skilfully incorporated into the early duet . The birth of a child is a harsh test for lovers ; often it enchants one more than the other , and then a bitter jealousy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of another 's world . Thus it is worth remembering that the object of marriage is not primarily the child , but the need for fellowship through life ; that as the years pass the child will more and more take its own courses , leaving behind to their devices those who fostered it . Therefore the wedded lovers must resolutely give each other their share of attention ; I purposely say " attention " rather than love , because attention is so difficult to give , consisting as it does in pretty words , forethoughts , the planning of minor pleasures , the sparing of small tasks ; it translates itself into an interest in ailments , doings , movements , into questions which the mate wishes to answer . So no mother can also succeed as a wife unless she sometimes clothes herself in the garb of an actress ; she may cast herself , if she likes , in the part of Medea . Her husband may seem shocked if she loves her children so little and him so well , but he will be flattered and assured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beautiful thing that will never grow old . " The word " actress " may in some breed anger , but the gentlest art must affront them . It does demand honesty between two people , but entire honesty may be excessive , for love is founded on truth with a dash of mendacity , and truth alone may prove arid if all illusion is removed . The tendency of lovers is too utterly to expose their innermost being , to tear away every affectation ... until at last they may reveal to each other their ordinary quality that was for a moment shrouded by a rosy veil . I suspect that truth has its limitations and that one of its uses is to provoke . Some may think that I lay too much stress on provocation , but I submit that courtship is mainly mutual provocation , and that marriage without provocation is marriage without courtship . Thus it may be well to allow in another knowledge of some early escapade , for this implies future risk and therefore enhances value , but it is not well to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To stimulate the imagination the power of all art is there , and the art of marriage is no exception . So , brutal exposure must be restrained , for the imagination flies best in a medium of film and cloud . Also , imagination has no scope if the mind is depressed ; harsh criticism cripples it and fills with a sense of injury the one whom gentle comment might brace . The gentlest art demands honest judgment between husband and wife . No two people can live long together without mutually discovering features that irritate . Some of us use a pet word or phrase the repetition of which exasperates ; some have regrettable manners in the street or at meat , arising from self-indulgence rather than ill-breeding . It is dangerous to overlook such trifles , for their unpleasantness accumulates like compound interest , but it is equally dangerous to tear at their old roots ; there is only one way , and that again is humility and self-examination . I know an ideal couple who from time to time sit down in joint humility ; each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as to awake in the other a greater fondness . Recently the wife has abandoned hackneyed quotations , the husband has foregone puns ; this sounds burlesque , but how tragic it would be if neither were honest and preferred to wither under the infliction of those quotations and those puns ! In such criticism danger lies , for it is easy to press too hard ; sometimes a quarrel must be faced . There is for this no remedy save to face it . One hears couples boast that no cross word ever passed between them , and I hear this with distress , for I am assured that these are truthful but not honest people ; if a man and a woman are honest in the ideal sense they must inevitably differ often and quarrel sometimes ; if they have never quarreled , then they must have suppressed their feelings , sinned against the conjugal canon of sincerity . I do not suggest that a multiplicity of quarrels indicates a community of spirit ( indeed , this indicates an ill - matched or maladroit pair ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn to ignore , to accept small remissnesses and damages , this in the name of humility , for they , too , err likewise . But I do suggest that where no quarrels form , at least one is pampered , flattered , spoiled , and that great harm is done him by the encouragement of his minor tyrannies . So the artist must know when to quarrel , when to quarrel deliberately ; he will choose always a case where the grounds for quarrel are not futile , indulge , revel in the quarrel , and at last emerge into the balmy air of reconciliation , having vented perhaps an accumulation of small angers . Marriage needs occasional liquidation of grievances , for these heap up , and the artist should know that when a woman weeps , apparently because her husband is late for dinner , she is actually bewailing a score of trifling offenses . Tears are usually a culmination , and it is well that women should weep , that men should swear ; tears and oaths relieve the tension , satisfy the one that releases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one couple who are never so well united as when the husband has made his wife cry ; her tears satisfy in him an obscure sense of retribution , while they slacken her own tension . Besides , tears and oaths are a language , the means of expression of inarticulate people of narrow vocabulary . In such conflicts the artist will eschew humor , unless the occasion is obviously futile ; a husband known to me , confronted with his wife 's tears when he half refused to buy her a cold-cure because he thus might miss his morning train , brought her to smile by remarking that evidently her tears came from a sore nose rather than a sore heart . But humor is a dangerous weapon , and the wedded artist will do well to introduce into his relation a lyric , a rhetorical touch . Let humor aim at all things , but not at the mate , lest the missile return laden with offense , as a boomerang . Such renunciations demand a certain generosity of mind in which many are lacking , as a rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first love has distressing implications , and I would suggest that marriage is better founded on last love . For the roots of wedded happiness are not set in innocence , spontaneity , unsoiled sincerity ; they thrive better in the oftturned garden of experience . There is more hope for those who have suffered , have been betrayed , or have betrayed and repented , than for the hotblooded , nursed in illusion , who commit themselves to a state to which their past offers no parallel . I have in mind more than one such case . I think of a man whose youth and ignorance made his past wife 's unhappiness ; whom another woman taught the meaning of pain ; who now , knowing both remorse and pain , has made a third woman 's delight . I think of a woman who expected " all " of her first love , gathered from him what he could give , expected little of her second , and is rewarded beyond her dreams . First love is tremulous and lovely , but inexpert ; it is a hunger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The young lover wishes to take , however much he may wrap up his desires and tell himself that he wishes to give . So he does not love ; he desires . One can ; if you will pardon the contradiction , love only if one has loved ; that is to say , few can ever accede to the august of love save by a strait and winding path . The ideal course is that of the lover who learns from repeated error and grief , not that others are unworthy of him , but that he is unworthy of them ; that he has failed in quality , striven too little , asked too much , been niggardly of gifts . That love is giving can not too far be stressed , nor is it a platitude . True love says not , " Will you be mine ? " but , " May I be yours ? " True love must light a white fire that shall consume , and its beacons must be fed from the flame of generosity ; there is in love no debit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has extended to accept all that is offered it . The artist asks of his lover no service , no subservience , no mercy ; he seeks neither housekeeper nor protector , nor social advertisement , nor gay acquaintance ; no roadmaker to power , no harbor of rest . He craves but one favor ? that he shall be allowed to give . If a creature can not , will not accept of another all the tender feelings and good material things it can give , then they are not for each other , can not fling open the casement of life . So the artist will serve ; his spirit rather than his body will serve . The artist will dress in a north light so that she may see herself cruelly , strive her utmost to achieve beauty . The artist will understand that happiness is the seed of beauty , that beauty is the seed of love ; he will bury little griefs that disturb , so that the loved one may not share them ; but in wisdom the artist will , sometimes too grudgingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to endow his mate with the subtlest of gifts ? the faculty of giving in return . To give and to receive gifts , such is the alternative to conquest . The perfectly mated are well aware of material thralls . Bred in humility , they know that life can fray the edge of the choicest stuffs ; that much room is held in it by headache , unreasonable worry , depression , unfulfilled longing , the sense of slow-passing hours ; briefly , that often existence lies heavy on the shoulders and that in such moments spirit does not leap up to meet spirit . They will strive to repress and conceal those moments when life is not , as Mrs. Humphry Ward gracefully puts it , " a pleasant promenade between two eternities , " and still more , they will remember that their partner shares their affliction . So they will not expect of that partner perpetual gaiety or quick interest ; they will understand and accept ill-humors which they can parallel , learn , as Mr. H. G. Wells says , " to love Isabel ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not love her at all . The course of the wedded artist is an endless tolerance , a joyful self-abnegation . The ideal of marriage is the optimistic nihilism of Schopenhauer ; the old German thinker found only three cures for life : art that decorates it , love that inflames it , philosophy that annuls it . Marriage should draw on all three , and in the love offering must first of all be generous . Negative generosity is more potent still when it takes the form of constancy , and notably when it jealously respects what Ibsen called the rights of the soul . Constancy is a compliment ; it is hypocrisy or illusion to pretend that a choice , however happy , can forever blind a lover to foreign charms ; indeed , I doubt that a man can love a woman greatly unless he love all women a little , and there is much truth in the remark that Mr. Marcel Prevost puts in the mouth of Francoise 's elderly relative : " My dear child , there are only two kinds of men ? those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who do not love women , and these bore you . " Complete mental constancy is unattainable , but it should be held up high as an excelsiorian banner , as the greatest offering . Material constancy is a common thing , that all may through a firm will achieve , while mental constancy is the land of Canaan that all shall see from the hill , but few enter into . It is best to face it simply and to emulate a couple known to me who have gaily exchanged a pledge to be as constant as they can . Constancy , fruit of true love , is best secured by the free to whom no fruits are forbidden . The free are those who enjoy " the rights of the soul " ? namely , liberty of opinion , of taste , of friendships , of movement . The artist must school himself to trust enough to question the legitimacy of no point of view , however much he contest its rightness ; he must fuse in the crucible of love the strangeness of the creature he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harshest demand upon love ? that he shall accord his mate privacy . The cultivation of privacy is , for vivid people , the most difficult of tasks ; the lover has captured a lover , and may not easily understand that within that lover 's being still hides a foreigner ; that a secret life is led in what Mr. Maeterlinck calls " the keep . " If he fails to understand this he will intrude when his mate wishes to retire into private thoughts ; he will scent depression where there is only meditation , and meaning to dispel it will produce the most hideous enemy of marriage -- the sense of caging . The true artist will be humble enough to know that his partner has , equally with him , brooding thoughts that none other , however dear , may share , because the essential beauty of memories and dreams is that they have a monarch and can accept no condominium . So he will not chafe if for hours his partner desires solitude , or even refuses him her company ; if he be truly wise he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is better to be absent when wanted than present when not wanted , and cultivate the genially cynical hope that his partner 's self-indulgence will soon require his collaboration , if only as a witness . Is it worth while , all this many will say . Complex and subtle as are the demands of the gentlest art , I think the answer is " yes . " For did we not , earlier in this paper , suggest that the mate who was worth fighting for to win is worth fighting for to keep ? He that has merely won shall clasp a shadow ; he that has retained shall for the rest of his life hold in his hand the fragrant ashes of incense .
