MADE desperate by our failure to escape from Damascus , we were ready to try without forethought any impossible plan that might be suggested between a halt and a halt , as we journeyed toward Aleppo . H. and I decided that if the train slowed down we would jump from it and make for the mountains . Then , at evening , we would find the German aerodrome and try to steal a machine , if this could be done against such possible odds as alert sentries , well-guarded hangars , and empty gasolene tanks . Once aboard the aeroplane , we would fly southeastward to the Palestine front . Luckily , perhaps , the train continued at a speed which precluded any leap from it ; so that we abandoned the wild scheme . Two rather better opportunities were made possible by the officer in charge of our guards ? a young Turk who was fanatical and unbelievably stupid . The party occupied two compartments , one containing three prisoners , the officer , and a Turkish private , and the other the remaining four prisoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer paid us not the least attention , whether to prevent a possible escape , to provide us with food , or even to count his prisoners from time to time . At suns he turned to the east and murmured his prayers , and at odd moments throughout the day , with head on breast , he muttered passages from the Koran . Nobody but Allah , Mohammed , and his fanatical little self seemed to interest him . He had a basket of bread and dried meat for himself ? but only for himself . After ten hours of hunger we stopped for a while at Horns , and in broken Arabic demanded food . He pointed to a man who was selling bread and hard-boiled eggs on the platform , explained that we were at liberty to buy from this hawker , and resumed his meditation . We left the train without hindrance , and mingled with th. people on the station . It would have been easy for at least two of us to slip away , with the crowd as screen . But the nearest point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had neither compass nor a supply of food , to make the attempt in our uniforms would have been madness . At this station I got into conversation with a Syrian woman from Lebanon , and from her learned of the dreadful conditions in that province . The crops had been commandeered , the cedars and the fruit-trees cut down by the Turks for fuel , the population was being systematically starved . Already thirty per cent . had died of destitution , she declared , including her father and her two children . She herself had come to Horns because there food and money were rather more plentiful . " The people of Lebanon perish , and neither God nor any one else helps us . " This in a tone of dull hopelessness , as if she was beyond even despair . And even as she said it , many a train-load of grain was en route for Germany , via Syria and Anatolia . The second chance came at Hamah , where we halted at dusk for half an hour . A little restaurant faced our compartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The young officer ordered us to stop , and a guard , running from the train , clutched at H. 's arm . H. shook him off , like a horse shaking off a fly , said , " Mungaree " ( his version of the Arabic word for food ) , and continued toward the restaurant . The Turkish officer continued to protest , but when we took not the slightest notice he joined us at the buffet , where for the price of two dollars one could buy a plate of goat 's meat , with bread and coffee . Afterward , while the Turk went outside with four of our number , H. , M. , and I remained to buy bread . When we returned to the platform not a guard was in sight . Moreover , our train had shunted backward . To reach it we should have to walk over fifty yards . We could see the little fanatic , stupidly unconscious as ever of what was happening , walking ahead of us between the rails , with the remainder of the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . " Hop back quickly and buy all the grub you can find . Get enough to last us to the coast . " " Six loaves of bread , twelve hard-boiled eggs , and some raisins , " I said to the waiter in the buffet . He disappeared into the back room , while I waited , uncomfortable under the curious looks of the diners at my uniform . " A German officer , " I heard one man tell his woman companion ; and I tried to look disdainful enough for the part . The waiter found that he could supply only three small loaves and a dozen eggs . With these tied in a bundle , 1 returned to H. and M. The military guard of the station was at the farther end of the platform , and to avoid him we had to walk along the line , in the direction of our own train . We intended to dodge behind some waiting trucks , about twenty yards ahead , slip over the siding on which they stood , and so to open country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the mad adventure was made impossible . Two guards came running toward us from the train . We walked on calmly in their direction , so that they showed no suspicions , and evidently thought we were alone as a result of misunderstanding . " Saa-eeda , " said H. , blandly , as he offered them cigarettes ; and this greeting disposed of whatever doubts they may have had . Yet the state of funk into which our short absence plunged the Turkish officerhad the effect of a shower-bath upon him . He roused himself from his former unintelligent disregard , and for the rest of the journey we were never allowed outside the carriage . Thus , once again , an absurd plan fell through at the outset ; for , with no guide , no compass , no water , and the necessity of buying more food , the odds would have been a hundred to one against our reaching the coast . And even if we had reached the coast it was improbable that we should have found a sailing-boat , ready to be stolen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our packs , we were trudging along the hot , uneven road from the railway station when three white-turbaned figures in khaki saluted from the balcony of a hospital . One of them put a crutch under his left armpit , I noticed , as he stood to attention . This simple salute warmed the heart , with its reminder that we were not altogether outcasts . We returned it with gusto ? as did a passing German officer , who thought it was meant for him . We were taken to a hotel where transient Turkish officers stayed on their way to Palestine and Mesopotamia . Recalling our attempted escape at Damascus , we were not surprised at never being allowed to leave the building . Indeed , I was astonished at not being sent to some prison , and surmised ? rightly , as it turned out ? that punishment must be in store for us farther down the line . For the rest , we spent several by no means uncomfortable days at Aleppo , with many an interesting hour of sightseeing from the balcony . The market-place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bazaar . Each evening Arab and Syrian hucksters arrived with flat barrows , or erected rickety stalls . Then , from baskets and panniers , they produced their wares , which they laid out for inspection ? loaves of bread , bowls of soured milk , basins of stew , cooked potatoes , roasted meats , boiled vegetables , cakes , nuts , or lengths of flexible candy . Some cooked meat or vegetables over metal bars , placed across a charcoal fire . As the crowd began to gather , the policeman circulated among the vendors , looking for such as had not paid the police baksheesh for their stand . Having found a victim , the gendarme would lead him gently around the corner to settle accounts ; after which the stallkeeper was at liberty to trade for the rest of the evening . Any who could not or would not pay were hustled from the market-place . Then , until about midnight , was acted a succession of minor comedies . In this bazaar trial by taste is evidently the custom ; and since Allah has provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? An intending buyer digs finger and thumb into some steaming dish , pulls out a chunk of meat or vegetable , and chews reflectively , Then he either purchases or passes on to the next stall , while somebody else follows and stuffs a hand into the same dish . I traced a few men and women who , by tasting meat at one stall , potato at another , and bread at a third , must have eaten quite a meal for nothing . This feat was difficult , however , for the stallkeeper had an uncanny instinct for bona-fide buyers , and ready kicks for such as were not . Over there is a potato-man who has dodged his dues to the gendarme , apparently because his ready cash is insufficient . As the gendarme approaches he picks up his basket , with the wooden box on which it rests , and fades intothe crowd . When the policeman has left he reappears and resumes business . Twice more he must shut up shop , for a quarter of an hour at a time , until finally his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guards the stall while hemeets the policeman ' roundthe corner . lie reappears , and , no longer obliged to shun overmuch attention , cries his wares loudly and does a roaring trade . The candy-barrows are mostly kept by small boys , comically dignified in apron and fez . Useless to think that youth makes them easy game , for they are sharp as pawnbrokers and can tell in the fraction of a second a had note or coin . Most of them seem to have a working arrangement with some gendarme , whereby if an adult tries to take advantage of their physical weakness they shriek invectives . The policeman then strolls leisurely toward the stall , and the would-be cheat wishes he had n't . One or two seedy ruffians hang around the fringe of the crowd , waiting for a chance at some petty villainy . Presently , out of the crush comes a little Syrian girl , carrying a bowl of milk . A much-mustached , dirty-robed Arab follows her into the entrance of a , narrow street , where he suddenly grabs the bowl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , and strides away . The little girl attracts a certain amount of attention by shrilling her protests , but the wolfish milk-drinker has vanished . A gendarme spectator makes no effort to interfere , not having been bribed to protect stray children . Soon afterward a similar theft is perpetrated by a similar ruffian , who grabs a chunk of meat from an old woman 's bowl of stew . In this case retribution comes swiftly and suitably . The Man Who Grabs Meat has failed to notice that the weak old woman is attended by a strong young man , who has lagged behind to talk to a friend . The strong young man leaps at the thief , kicks him in the stomach ? hardknocks him down when he doubles up helplessly , and proceeds to beat him , while the old woman shrieks her venom . The gendarme is much amused . Through the changing crowd pass the vendors of drinks , clanging a brass cup against a brass can to attract attention , but neither washing nor rinsing the cup after somebody has drunk from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a glass of arak in the nearby caf ? , while his wife guards the barrow . Between eleven o'clock and midnight the traders begin to run out of stock . They pack up their kit and , before leaving , bargain volubly with one another over the exchange of eatables for their own domestic use ? two loaves for a dish of vegetables , a can of milk for three slices of meat . The streets empty , the cries cease , the gendarmes disappear with their baksheesh , and we retire to join the little things that hop and crawl in our beds . With such sights and sounds we whiled away our confinement at Aleppo . Always there was something to distract us . A Mohammedan official of the Indian Postal Service , for example , helped to prevent us from brooding overmuch . With only a fez differentiating his uniform from that of most native officers of the Indian army , we accepted him at first as a fellow-prisoner . But when , at table , he asked leading quest.ions about the Palestine operations , H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We took the hint and answered very vaguely . " Do n't like the look of the little blighter , " said II. , after dinner . " Let 's watch him . " He was worth watching . Every day , we found , he walked in the streets without a guard . Moreover , he was living by himself in a comfortable room . While this exceptional treatment of a prisoner did not prove treachery , the circumstantial evidence was fairly damning , and we became as unopened clams when he talked to us . This was the right attitude ; for later , when at a concentration-camp , we learned thatthis Mohammedan Indian was an outand-out-traitor . Sometimes he was seen enjoying himself at Constantinople , sometimes he talked in railway trains to newly captured prisoners , sometimes he talked with them in hospitals . Once , in a hospital at Mosul , he was placed next to a wounded officer taken in a recent battle . His assumed complaint was influenza ; yet he received full diet , and his temperature remained normal while he lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A prisoner of war in the East senses his surroundings far more intimately than the traveler . Temporarily he is of the East . Of necessity his captors regard him as something more intimate than the transient Westerner who , while moving freely among them , lives according to Western customs and tradition ; and of necessity the man who is forced to live among Easterns and according to Eastern customs is more likely to understand the mental attitude whereby the crooked road is chosen in preference to the straight , whereby anything unexpected and fantastic may happen at any time , whereby ? to repeat an illustration of my friend , Jean Willi , the dragoman ? a man may get married in the morning and be a solitary fugitive for his life in the evening . . So it was with us . The continuity of strange impressions and experiences reacted on me till I forgot to realize that I was an ordinary Englishman held prisoner in what to me was an extraordinary country at an extraordinary period , and became as fatalistic and unsurprised as the Arabs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should be punished for having wanted to escape . Of what the punishment might consist we guessed nothing , except that it was likely to be something novel for which we should be quite unprepared . Meanwhile , it was of absorbing interest to sit on the balcony at Aleppo and study the motley crowd in the bazaar . On leaving Aleppo we knew neither the next stage of the journey nor our ultimate destination ; and we were content that it should be so , for a future that is certain to be unpleasant is better indefinite than definite . For this journey our escort consisted of two gendarmes and two soldiers . First we were herded into a third-class compartment , windowless and altogether filthy . Already , before we arrived , it was crowded with unwashed and unkempt peasants , so that our party of eleven was allowed to occupy seven seats only . One of the gendarmes , who could murder French , advised us never to let our few belongings out of our hands , " or , " said he , " we meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We liked the looks of neither the car riage nor the fellow-passengers , and thought how much more pleasant agoodstruck would be . The German soldiers in the East shared our views , for they always traveled in trucks . R. and I persuaded a gendarme to Lake us to the office of the station commandant , in the hope of being allotted better quarters . The commandant was polite , but pretended that he could offer nothing better . Then , as we passed along the platform , I saw a clean , covered-in truck , with a few Germans inside it . One man leaned idly against the entrance , and him I asked politely if , since there was much room to spare , they could lend us a corner . " Ausgesehlossen ! " he growled . " Wir wollen Iceine Englander , " We were about to move on when " Was gibt ' s ? " called a Feldwebel as he stepped from the truck . I explained that seven British officers , two of them wounded , longed for floor space , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps we can manage it , " said the Feldwebel . " What 's Paris like now ? " he asked , suddenly , and went on to explain that before the war he was a bank-clerk there . With one eye on the covetedspace in the truck , I admitted to having lived for a time on the rive gauche , discussed peace-time and war-time Paris , and even ? for one will put up with a lot to avoid traveling in a Turkish third-class carriage ? listened patiently to the German 's reminiscences of a love-affair with a French cabaret singer . This display of patience was rewarded . He took a referendum of his five companions , and all , except the surly brute to whom I had first spoken , agreed to cede us half the truck . The Feldwebel asked permission of a German major to invite us inside , and the major agreed . " But only because you happen to be fellow-Europeans , " he explained , " while the Turks are not . " A small bribe to the gendarme , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for all , prisoners and guards , to lie on the floor of the truck , so that by comparison we traveled de luxe . The Germans were friendly ; and the Feldwebel , after I had pretended to be interested in more tales of his alTaires de ceeur , gave us a supply of tea with the loan of a spirit-stove for boiling it . So , with poker and talk , we traveled for four days across Asia Minor . On three of the four evenings a certain amount of excitement was caused by Turkish soldiers attempting to desert when the train halted . They ran toward the hill , sometimes fired upon and sometimes chased . Several were captured , several got away and went to swell the huge total of brigands . In that part of 1918 the number of deserters and brigands all over Turkey was enormous . Hundreds of thousands deserted from the army , and of these scores of thousands took to the mountains and wild places of Asia Minor , there to become robbers . Traveling on foot , on horseback , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree . In every fastness one would be certain to meet a band of armed ruffians , destitute and utterly merciless , who would cheerfully kill for the sake of a pair of boots or a shirt . More than a few German soldiers who had walked a mile or two from the beaten track were killed by brigands . Many of the gendarmes sent to deal with the robber bands were found dead , with their heads battered in . Many others were hand-in-glove with them , and gave information of possible plunder . Sometimes a gang would descend on a village , kill a few inhabitants as a warning to the others , and proceed to steal everything worth the stealing before they retired . On the eastern side of the Taurus we detrained , and were transferred to the narrow-gage line that traversed the great Taurus tunnel before the broad-gage railway was completed . For eight hours , on a swaying little train with miniature engine , we moved through the tunnel 's half-light , with an occasional interval of sunlight at gaps between the mountains . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Berlin-Bagdad Railway . With Serbia overrun and Bulgaria and Turkey as Germany 's allies , the line from Berlin to Constantinople was straightforward . Already in 1915 the Anatolian Railway linked Constantinople to Konia . At the eastern end , the line from Bagdad ( once Turkey should have regained it ) could be extended across the desert to Mosul , ' while the stretch of country from Mosul to Aleppo would offer no difficulties . Between Konia and the line from Aleppo , however , was the great natural barrier of the Taurus Mountains . The rock stratum in the Taurus is among the hardest in the world . For many months it resisted all ordinary drills . The Berlin-Bagdad Railway Company caused various special drills to be made , and then , after infinite labor and experiment , began boring slowly through the rock . The natural diffi- I The British have already extended it beyond Samarrah.culties ? precipices , steep slopes , chasms , and gorges ? were tremendous . Nobody who has passed through the hollowed rock can deny that the Taurus line is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a giant gorge on the western slopes . Trains began running through the Taurus Mountains , along the broad-gage line , just two months before the armistice ; and the Berlin to Bagdad Railway , including this wonderful tunnel , is now to be the London and Paris to Bagdad Railway . Already the line goes as far eastward as Mosul , while the westward rails from Bagdad are . fast moving from Samarrah to Mosul . These , when completed , will be the last links in the great railway chain from Boulogne to Bagdad . When the tunnel under the English Channel has been constructed the railway will stretch without a break from London to Bagdad . Throughout the war this work on the Anatolian Railway was done mainly by British Tommies and Indian soldiers , picked from among the survivors of the captured garrison of Kut-el-Amara . With them were a few German technical officers and soldiers , some Turkish guards , and many Turkish laborers . As workmen , the Turks were hopeless , except when set to tasks that required no intelligence ; and even then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid and fed by the Germans than were the prisoners who worked for the Turks , soon established a curious ascendancy . If it suited them they did four times the work of the Turks . They were intelligent , and could be trusted with funds . It was not long before some of them were in charge of Turkish gangs . Several filled positions of importance , with good salaries and plenty of freedom . When , having emerged from the tunnel , we halted for a few hours at Belamedik , we were greeted by groups of these prisoner-officials , eager for news of the war . They were in civilian clothes furnished by the Dutch Legation at Constantinople . Such as wore hats and clean collars were always greeted respectfully with the title of effendi by the Turkish laborers . One Tommy ? a Glasgow warehouseman ? had charge of all the office staff , with Greek clerks under him . Another ? an Australian ? was actually paymaster of the construction department . Many thousands of dollars passed through his hands each month , and the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? prisoners of war , in the wildest part of Anatolia , as responsible employees of a great engineering company controlled by the enemy . From Belamedik we proceeded to Bosanti , where , in those days , the broad-gage line ended and the narrow-gage line began . There we stayed for a night and a morning . At Bosanti , also , was a gang of British prisoners . Six of them took us to their but and demanded the latest news of the war . At that time we had little that was good to tell . The German drive toward Amiens and Paris was in full swing ; the Italians had been badly beaten on the Piave ; the tonnage sunk by submarines was enormous . Our one bright item of news was that thousands of Americans were pouring into France daily ; which fact ? greatly surprised these isolated prisoners , who , from what they had been told by the Germans or had read in the Turkish papers , thought that no American troops could have arrived on the western front . Having distracted the guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hut , the Tommies changed the subject to escape talk . A party of five ? two Australians , two Englishmen , and a French petty officer from a captured submarine ? had built a collapsible boat . In three weeks ' time they would all apply for twenty-four hours ' rest rom work , a privilege allowed by the German supervisor every three months . Carrying the boat in VOL , CXXXIX. ? No , 832. - 72sections and enough food for a fortnight , they would then slip away and begin tramping toward the coast near Mersina , They expected to he walking for about ten days , after which they would assemble the boat at night and put to sea , in the hope of either being picked up by an Allied vessel or of rowing to Cyprus . Five months had been spent in building the boat , the work being done in the but at odd moments , sometimes by day and sometimes by night , but always with a man on the lookout for intruders . Tools , strips of metal , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German workshops . After making sure that the guards were unsuspicious , an Australian lifted the tip of a plank beneath his bed and extracted one of the steel ribs . It was beautifully made , with folding joint in the center and clasp and socket at either extremity . He likewise produced a compass and a revolver , bought secretly from a friendly German private . Both these articles would be necessary , the compass because the escapers would be unable to follow the road , and the revolver because they would be certain to meet brigands . One can imagine the determination and perseverance that made possible the long hours of secret work on the collapsible boat , extending over months of careful designing , of filching the required material , of odd-moment construction under great difficulty , always with the urgent fear of discovery . I. wish it were possible to tell of their success . About a mouth after we left Bosanti they slipped away , according to plan . Carrying the boat in sections , besides food and the oars , they walked in night marches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast . Three times they met brigands ; but the revolver enabled them to bluff their way through . And then , when already within sight of the sea , a gendarme saw them . Four of the plucky five were captured , while the fifth managed to hide in a cleft between two rocks , with the complete framework of the boat . That night he dragged it down to the deserted part of the beach . On the following night he pieced it together . He put to sea , and for eight hours made a desperate effort to leave the coast ; but the shoreward currents were too strong for him and the weak little craft drifted hack . He was recaptured and sent to join the four other adventurers in prison . Next morning , while waiting for our train , we watched the Tommies at work . Some aeroplanes were on their way to Palestine , and the prisoners were told to transfer them to the small-gage railway . The men seemed listless and uninclined to hasten as they carried the machines to the secluded siding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find , however , that , once they began packing the aeroplane sections on the small trucks , they appeared to be keen and painstaking . In the distance we could see them grouped around each truck in turn , as they worked steadily throughout the morning . " You always as keen as this in handling Hun war material ? " asked H. of a burly Londoner of the Old Regulars , who strolled across from the siding . " Sometimes we arc , sir , sometimes we ai n't . " " You could n't have done a better morning 's work in a munitions-factory at home . " " That 's right . We 've done a good mornin 's work . " " But these are Hun aeroplanes , man . What the ? " " As you remark , sir , they 're Hun aeroplanes . But I doubt if they 'll ever Then we guessed . The Tommy amplified our guesses with details . " Yus , we do a bit o ' wreckin ' ? sabb " rtage , as you might say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yer ca n't say as we do n't behave beautiful till we 're there . Then we ' ave the lids off a few boxes , see what 's inside , and proceed according to regulations . Criminul , I calls it . . . . That ' ere siding 's a useful place . Out o ' the way , yer know . The Roches do n't go there . ' Corse , if any Boches are near we resoom legitimate operations till they 've ' opped it . Turks ? We do n't let ' em see , neither , if we can ' elp it . Once or twice Turkish ( mime ' ve seen us at play , but they only laughs . They ' ates the Huns a blurry sight more ' n we do . Why , I remember when a coupler Turks ' elped us in the good work one mornin ' . " " Guns an ' aererplanes is ' andiest , " he continued , reflectively . " Yer see , when we finds the breech-block uv a gun it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , accordin ' as the gunners with us sez . Aererplanes we attacks mostly on the longeerongs ? those ribs o ' wood that runs claim the length of the body , ai n't they ? English pilot ' oo passed dahn the line some months ergo give us the tip . ' Corse , we gives the other parts a bit uv attention ? wires an ' spars , an ' such like . . . . No , it do n't seem likely that those things over there 'll fly fer a long time . " We agreed when we heard the full details of the sabotage . Besides ripping the fuselage fabric and cutting right through some of the longerons , the Tommies had hacked at struts , and clipped the bracing wires . They had pried open wooden cases , and before replacing the covers had snapped spars , bent elevators and rudders , and been generally unpleasant to the planes . This kind of wrecking was also being done , in greater or less degree , at Belarnedik and other points on the railway where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these six aeroplanes at Bosanti had a peculiar sequel . When the British entered Nazareth ( the Turco-German headquarters in Palestine ) during General Allenby 's final advance , they captured many staff documents . Among the papers was a letter from the 0 . C. German Flying Corps on that front to Air Headquarters in Germany , complaining bitterly about the bad packing and handling in transit of aeroplanes sent to Palestine . As an instance , it mentioned these very six machines ( my comparison of dates and details established the point ) ? single-seater scouts of the Fals type ? and declared that not one of them was fit to be assembled for flying . Enclosed was a photograph of some queer-looking debris that had once been a wing . The protest ended with the request that the men who packed these six craft should be severely punished . Boches are Boches , but justice is justice ; and , with memories of what I saw at Bosanti , I hope that the German packers were not punished . Having said good-by to these Kut-elAmara survivors who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we passed on toward Konia . And even as we steamed westward from Bosanti The Aeroplanes That Never Would Fly steamed eastward , through the great tunnel that never would be a link in a Berlin-Bagdad chain of railways .
