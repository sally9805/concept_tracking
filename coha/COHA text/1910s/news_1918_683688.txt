txt Edward N. Hurley , Chairman of the United States Shipping Board , and Charles Plez , General Manager of the Emergency Fleet Corporation , yesterday visited three of the Newark shipbuilding plants to find out what effect the order of Fuel Administrator Garfield would have in the supply of steel there and also to try to aid the Superintendents of- one of the 3ard in devising plans for getting 1,000 cars of materials that have delayed the work on one of the ships since the keel was laid a month ago . A few minutes after Mr. Hurley had gone into the yard of the Submarine Boat Corporation , where the keel of the . first statndardized steel ship was laid on Dec. 20 , he interrupted his inspection of the yards to send a telegram to William G. , Director General of the Railroads , asking him to redouble his efforts to get the 1M00 ears of steel parts to the yards from the congested railroads . The text of the telegram was not given out , but it was learned that Mr. Hurley was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made repeatedly by the officials of the Submarine Boat Corporation and by members of the Shipping Board . Of the 1,000 cars of steel tied up on railroads , seine of them under orders for shipment before any other kind of freight except fuel and food , a large number have been on the railroads since - November , more than a month before the keel of the first ship was laid . No additional work on the ship can be done until the steel is received by the yards , and about 8 , .100 workers in the yards may be laid off when other work has been completed . Officials Eager to Fulfill Promlne . After the first keel was laid on Dee . eo the work was practically suspended while the corporation waited for its delayed fabricated steel parts that had been shipped from the steel plants in November . Officials pointed out to Mr. Hurley that it had been impossible for the corporation to continue the work . and asked his ass stance in getting the Director General of the Railroads in rushing the 1,000 cars of materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their promises upon the number of ships they could turn out at their yards . Officials of the Submarine Boat Corporation have been chafing at the delay of the railroads for weeks , and they expected relief when the Director General was named . But they have not been able to get their parts for the ships yet . " It alight look a little like camouflage to make a great noise about laying the keel of a ship and telling the public all ab ? ut how many ships we were going to build here in a short time , " said one of the officials , " but we have been unable to get our steel parts from the railroads , and since the keel. was laid we have done practically no work at all on this first ship . I spoke of the delay about two weeks ago . but we were hoping then that the freight tangle would be undone so that we could go ahead . Of cowse , the facts have been reported to the Shipping Board . " Workmen Shovel Snow . ' rho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this first standardized ship have been retained by the corporation in daily expectation that enough steel would arrive to enable the men to go to work , at least slowly , on the first ship . They have been employed in buildings ways for other ships and in preparing for the expansion of the yards , but'even that work has been delayed because of the lack of materials . Seine of the men have been shovling snow in the yards , but they were is:signed to that work only to hold them or work on the ships . Officials said that laborers for shoveling of snow , : leaning up the yards , and doing much A the work done by the shipbuilders could have been hlren in great numbers any time , so that the work was merely an excuse to hold the men . The steel parts for the standardized ships to be built by the ** Boat Corporation come from forty-seven different manufacturers , but the officials of the corporation say that the manufacturers have had their parts for the ships ready for shipment before they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were shipped in November , and they have not reached the plant yet . Neither have other parts needed later in the program , but they could not be put into the structure of the ship until the first parts had been built . In . If materials are rushed to the yard the officials says they may be able to hold their force by using the men in building new ways for other ships , although that is not the work they were hired to do . After he had sent his telegram to Mr. Mr. Huriby and Piez continued their inspection of the yards of the Submarine Boat Corporation , and , although their original program had included inspections of other yards today , they returned to Washltrgon last night . Mr. tinyley made a short inspection of the three ships under construction In the plants of the Fedor:II Shipintilding Company , and , although he found that the officials eNpericnced some delay in deliveries of shipments of steel by the railroads. their troubles were not nearly so great Its in the Submarine Boat Corporation yards . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steel Corporation , and Meat of steelel for the ships comes front their plants . Mr. Hurley discussed also with the officials of the Federal yards what possible delay might be caused on their three . ships by the shutting down of the steel mills in compliance with tho order of the Fuel Administrator . In the yards of the Foundation Cornparry , the third yard visited by the two I officials of the Emergency Fleet Corporation , three wooden ships are being built . Officials said that they had plenty of timber in the yards to continue their work . In discussing the housing problem at the Newark shipyards Mr. iinrlry said lie did not think It would lie necessary I for the Government to give its aid , be-1 cause he saki he thought the city would I be able to accommodate any number that . might be employed in the vicinity .
