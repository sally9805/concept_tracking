txt When Dr. Frederick Franz Friedmann of Berlin landed on these shores on Tuesday , it was popularly understood that he had crossed the Atlantic with his tuberculosis discovery to win the $1,000,000 offer made by President Charles A. Finlay of the Aetna National Bank if he could cure ninety-five out of 100 selected after of tuberculosis , and waen , - shortly after his landing , Dr. Friedmann disowned ally intention of accepting such an offer . there was immediate speculation as to just what motive or motives had brought him to this country . In his behalf , both by him and for him . it was said that he had come here only to demonstrate his treatment , only to heal the sick . and those in his party generally expressed themselves as convinced that Dr. Friedmann 's last thought was for the money possibilities : revolved in his discovery , the announcement of which precipitated a controversy both in Europe ' and America , because of the marked scarcity of scientific information accompanying the announcement . ? Great interest , therefore , attached to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E. Sterne of In-. clianapolis that within three days he had seen and examined what purported to be a contract drawn up between Dr. Fried- , mann and Albert von Hoffman of St. ' Louis by virtue of which Dr. Friedmann 's famous remedy , should its value be satisfactorily demonstrated , was to be put on the market as a patented article by a St. Louis syndicate headed by Mr. Von Hoffman himself . This information was immediately submitted to the visiting scientist himself . He denied with great vigor that he was bound by any contract with Von Hoffman , and through his secretary . Mr. Hundt , explained that whatever tentative agreement he had entered into with the St. Louis man for the sale of the remedy , had been broken off . He very frankly displayed some correspondence which slion-ed that the negotiations with Mr. Von Hoffman were still pending so recently as Jan . DM and , therefore , some days after the Berlin dispatches predicted his early trip to America . Sought ' Patent to Control It . The discovery of this fact lent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokesmen here that ' his application for patents . on . his " method of preparing curative and protective materials against tuberculosis " - had been made simply that Ite.:Ailight gain " control " of his discovery  --  a control desired because he did not wish the treatment to be misused by every uninformed doctor who might lay hands on it . The discovery of the Von Hoffman negotiations recalled that statement in the Fri ( dmann article prepared fur the Sunday Magazine of the Trmss of Feb. 23 by one of this country 's foremost research workers in tuberculosis : That statement read : If Friedmann 's " cure " is a distinct advance it will soon be In the hands of everybody who is capable of using it , both in treatment and experimentation . The man or drug house that paid a $1.000.000 for the " rights " would clear as much on the investment as on a diamond mine in iioboxen  --  provided always the " rights " were used legitimately and without the accessories that usually accompany the marketing of such a standard preparation as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informant in the Von Hoffmail matter , Dr. Sterne , is a distinguished physician physician or tie ' Middle West and President of the Mississippi Valley Medical Association . He is now in New York , having conic East in connection with one of the cases in his practice , and this is the story he tells : He was in the smoker of the Pullman that brought him from Indianapolis when the conversation of the men there turned cn the Friedmann discovery and its probable value to humanity . There were diverse lay opinions expressed . and as a physician the disputants turned to him . Ile spoke of the validity of the Friedmann claim as a question still open , but referred to the widespread adverse opinion expressed among the German iShysicians and the scantiness of the data concerning his injection that Dr. Friedmann had bee willing to give . Von Hoffman Hxhibits a Contract . This aroused Mr. Von Hoffman . who chanced to be in. the impromptu party , and he spoke of a contract which lie had entered into , with the Berlin physician by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although deeply interested , Dr. Sterne asked no more questions then , for the hour was late . but next morning , as he and Mr. Vim Hoffman were speeding on from Philadelphia to New York , the latter became more communicative , and in the ' end produced the document signed by Dr. Friedmann and purporting to be a contract by which the discovery would pass into the commercial hands of Mr. Von Hoffman should its vOidity as a tuberculosis treatment be ddmonstrated . Mr. Von Hoffman was very candidly in the position of a shrewd business man who wouftl have to be " shown " before any money changed hands . He was on his way East , he explained . to meet the doctor , due to land the next day in New York . The past history of the contract was simply stated . Mr. Von Hoffman . who is interested in the business side of aviation , had been in Germany last year on business of that character , when he learned that a cousin of his wife , who lived in Germany . was busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trail . ' 1,7e followed it to the doctor himself , found that a tuber culosis " cure " was in process of development and immediately broached a scheme for putting it on the American market , if it should " make good . " The German financiers were not to be considered in the same breath with generous , ample American capital , he said , and so Dr. Friedmann was urged to throw in his lot with American business . According to Mr. Von Hoffman 's highly gratified account to Dr. Sterne , these preliminaries led to a satisfactory contract which would mean a big thing if the " cure " made good . Von Hoffman Deal Off , He Says . That , briefly , was Dr. Sterne 's story to the representative of The Times who saw him last evening . A call was immediately paid , to Mr. Von Hoffman 's hotel ; but , while he was found registered there , he was not in . Then the story was taken to Dr. Friedmann , and he , throughthe interpretation of his secretary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried to the Friedmann apartment at the Waldorf-Astoria , it was related in full to Mr. Hundt , who lilsteued to it gravely , and then took it into Dr. Friedmann 's room . Aftr an interval . of three of four minutes they both came out , the doctor armed with correspondence . Yes , he had known Herr Von Hoffman . Yes , Herr Von ' Hoffman had desired to purchase the remedy . There had been a tentative contract . Mr. Hundt said , but this had been broken off . Then the doetor exhibited a letter written by himself to Mr. Von Hoffman . bearing date of Jan. it 1913 , written in German , and setting forth , as he explained , his final conditions and terms in the negotiations . What those conditions were he did not say last evening , but in the letter he warned the American that they must be accepted unconditionally by wire by Jan. 25 , and later by letter , together with a sworn signature , which should reach Dr. ? Friedmann no later than Feb. 1 , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the letter , he should consider chimself " no longer bound . " The time limits were reached and passed . he said , and Mr. Von Hoffman had not accepted the terms or answered in any way . That ended the St. Louis man as far as Dr. Friedmaan was con , cerned . " I believe he is in New York , " he said . " He has written and called , and telephoned twice . But I have refused to answer , refused to see him . There is no contract between us. - We have no furtiter relations . I am here to demonstrate the value of my treatment . I wish to be let alone to do that . T want to give health . I am not a business man to sell it , nor a lawyer to make contracts . I ' am just a doctor . I want to show that my discovery is all that I believe it to be . I want to heal the sick . After that . business ; but the treatment first . " von Hoffman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a St. Louis advertising man , was found in his hotel late last night . " I have a contract with Dr. Fried. ; Mann . " he said , " and I consider it bind , ing . More detail than this 1 will not give now , but later , when the proper time comes . " According to Mr. Von Hoffman , he sent up his card to the Friedmann apartment in the Waldorf yesterday and received in return the curt direction that he state his business . Much surprised , he sent this note to Dr. Friedmann : " I returned from Mexico a few days ago . and found your registered letter of Jan. 11 , 1913 , awaiting me . My business , which you now ask that I state before seeing you , is in regard to the contract which I have with you . I await your answer . " In response the envelope came back with " Wait " blue-penciled upon it . The injunction to wait caused Mr. Von Hoffman to leave the Waldorf immediately , first penning at note which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall expect ' to hear from you today . " ? He did not hear from him yesterday . Mr. Von Hoffman explained Oast night that the letter of Jan. 11 from Berlin was held at his St. Louis office because neither his office associates nor friends knew where he could be reached . He was somewhere in Mexico with his family , and escaped after fourteen days of confusion in the troublous times- there . He returned to St Louis by special train , bringing home a tale of great adventure . But that is another story ' ' According to St. Louis dispatches . Mr. Von Hoffman is said to be interested in bringing . from Germany an airship capable of carrying thirty passengers and valued at $200,000 . Company a Hatter of the Future . Earlier in the evening before the Von Hoffman story came out , the reporters who , assembled at the Friedmann suite on the eleventh , .. floor of the Waldorf , asked the doctor 's brother , Dr. A. C. H. Friedmann Friedmann of COlorado . Springs , how Dr. F. F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a consulting physician , " was the - immediate answer . " He will be paid by his fees . But I see , andI am glad to , see- - et , ! that lie . has - left. money considera-tion consideration in the background . Where is Shwa -- 141 lutely nothing in the story that he will charge Mr. Finlay $50,000 for treating his son-in-law , Mr. Paris . " I personally have advised by brother to treat Mr. Finlay 's son-in-law free and to tell him , , should be protest , that it would he quite as satisfactory if he would drop $5 in the contribution box at church . " This expression of generous intention on the part of the Berlin physician was repeated in so many forms by so many authorities yesterday that the reporters asked about the patent applications which caused such widespread expressions of disapproval on the other side of the water . Then came the explanation that this was purely that Dr. Friedmann should have control " in the interests of its proper use . Was there no inetntion. some day . of forming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " There would have to be some such concern , I suppose , " said Dr. A. C. H. Friedmann . " Certainly that is something that must be considered in the future . But not yet . " Big Demand for His Cure . Dr. Friedmann , in his first day at the Waldorf , was fairly beset with visitors and communications of every sort . Many a shabbily dressed man and woman walked wistfully to the clerk 's desk at the hotel and left a card there for Dr. Friedmann , but announcement had already been made that it would take him at least three days to prepare his cultures for the treatments , and yesterday afternoon the Waldorf Management was 1 ? Psponsible for circulating a statement , signed by Dr. Friedmann 's secretary , to this effect : While in New York Dr. Friedmann has chosen the Waldorf-Astoria for his residence only . He will take offices where he will treat patients . Under no circumstances will he see patients at the Waldorf . This became necessary , so great was the desire to see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country and Canada . The governor of Arkansas sent on the head et Chat State 's tuberculosis work with a young patient . The Governor of Pennsylvania sera on a young man with the promise of a splendid appointment should he take the Friedmann treatment and find it effective . From every quarter came physicians anxious to learn something about the remedy and many of them anxious to get on the doctor 's staff . There had been hundreds of such offers , it was said , with no request for any other reward than the familiarity with the Friedmann method of treating tuberculosis . From these a staff would be selected , to work with Dr. Friedmann in offices which he woud select shortly in a central location . " He needs only a six-by-six foot room for his laboratory , " the brother explained . The decision to take offices , it is understood was made despite the offer of i a ward n a New York hospital , conveyed to the visiting physician by one ' of its Begird of Trustees . At the Waldorf suite last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning Dr. Friedmann would confer with Dr. Milton Foster , the representative of Surgeon General Rupert Blue of the Public Health and Marine Hospital Service , in preparation for the Government examination of the Friedmann treatment . According to Dr. Friedmann 's brother , it would take an ordinary physician about six weeks to master the treatment sufficiently for use in private practice .
