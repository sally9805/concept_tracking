In a discussion of Mr. Dreiser 's work , recently printed in these pages , I offered a Protest against the confusion which results from calling all novelists who deal with contemporary life realists ; and I proposed , as a means of making useful distinctions among them , a scrutiny of the bundle of general ideas which constitutes for each his " working philosophy , " and which , as I maintained , necessarily underlies the artistic representation of each and in considerable measure determines its form . Having proposed to distinguish Mr. Dreiser as a naturalist on the basis of his theory of animal behavior , I felt the need of supplementing my argument by exhibiting the relationship , in some conspicuous exemplar , between genuine realism and a respectable theory of human conduct . Arnold Bennett at once appeared in at least one respect to be the most promising candidate for the position . His works , to be sure , are of very unequal value , for , frankly writing to live , he has diversified the production of masterpieces by the production of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaring that his best novels ? " The Old Wives ' Tale , " " Clayhanger , " " Hilda Lessways , " and the newly published " These Twain , " 4 " completing the Clayhanger trilogy  --  produce upon them an unprecedented impression of reality . These books , we are told , challenge and endure a comparison not with literature , but with life itself . Their " transcript " of Five Towns society is so detailed , so nearly complete , and so accurate that it may be used by the student of human nature with almost the same confidence that he places in his own firsthand observations . I was glad to find general agreement on this point , for it relieved me of the task of justifying my own conviction that Mr. Bennett is a realist . The only objection that I saw to the choice of Mr. Bennett as the contemporary realist was that the very critics who praise the reality of his representations insist rather sternly that he has no " philosophy of life , " that he does not interpret his facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his transcript . Mr. Darton , who has just written a book about him , and who is himself a novelist , says : " In the Five Towns novels there is no ideal . There is no criticism . There is no tradition or philosophy of society . There is nothing but life as the people described live it and see it and feel it . " This is highly interesting , if true . If true , it effectively disposes of my contention that an artist can not observe . New York . George H. Doran Co without a theory . If true , it should suggest to the younger realistic writers who are looking to Mr. Bennett as their master the wisdom of making all haste to get rid of their ideas . Mr. Darton 's assertion that Arnold Bennett 's work has no value save that of mere representation was anticipated by Mr. Henry James in his discussion of the " new novel " in 1914 , and was by him extended to an entire group of the younger writers , of which he specified Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristic of the group , according to Mr , James , is " saturation . " By this he means , as I take it , that all these novelists , and to a high degree their leaders , are masters of the materials of their art . They know with extraordinary completeness and detail what they are talking about . When they have made us see what they have seen , they yield us no further satisfaction . They squeeze the sponge or , as Mr. James puts it , the " orange " ; this gives us an " express sion of life . " Expectant but disappointed criticism cries : " Yes , yes  --  but is this all ? These are the circumstances of the interest  --  we see , we see ; but where is the interest itself , where and what is its centre , and how are we to measure it in relation to that ? " I can not follow a critic who finds Wells and Bennett alike in their dominant value , and , what is far more interesting , neither can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind by the polite implication that he is only a thoroughly immersed sponge , he has retorted in his semi-pseudonymous " Boon , " 1915 , with a scathing criticism and a " take-off " on Mr. James , whom he links with Mr. George Moore by virtue of their sterile mstheticizing . That is their dominant " value " ? their central " interest . " His own central interest , as he reasserts with more than customary vehemence and formlessness , is the expression of his yearning for a life of divine efficiency and divine ecstasy . He has a theory of conduct which has developed out of that romantic yearning ; and his representations of life in fiction are experimental illustrations of that theory . It is quite absurd to charge an author with " mere representation , " who almost invariably bursts the outlines of his hero , disrupts his narrative in mid-career , shatters the illusion of reality , and buries all the characters under the avalanche of his own personal dreams and desires . Mr. Wells , in brief , cherishes a " philosophy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a realistic novel . He is dedicated to romance . His high calling is to write pseudo-scientific fantasies and fairy tales of contemporary society . Mr. Wells in " Boon " incidentally repudiates yoke-fellowship with the novelist of the Five Towns in a passage which gives us the key to Mr. Bennett 's philosophical position . Mr. Bennett is there recorded as a " derelict , " an " imperfectly developed , " an " aborted " great man surviving from the old times : " Would have made a Great Victorian and had a crowd of satellite helpers . Now no one will ever treasure his old hats and pipes . " This is both amusing and instructive . Mr. Wells does not call a man a Victorian without malice aforethought . If I may be pardoned a violent expression , Mr. Wells would like to slay all the Victorians ; better still , he would like to believe that they are all dead . What he objects to in that generation is not the " mere representation " of the novelists ; it is the accursed philosophy of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove , alas , that this philosophy is not dead yet . His solid realistic novels protest against Mr. Wells 's fairy tales . His vision of life protests against Mr. Wells 's vision of life . " The Old Wives ' Tale " makes " The Research Magnificent " look like child 's play . Put " These Twain " beside " Marriage , " and instantly the art of the latter seems flimsy and incondite , and its informing ideas fantastic . And one may perhaps just note in passing that beside any one of Mr. Bennett 's novels , Mr. Dreiser 's " Genius " instantly appears to be a " barbaric yawp . " An author whose work thus judges , so to speak , another work with which it is brought into contact , has a potent critical value meriting examination . The popular impression that Mr. Bennett has no general ideas is easily explained by the fact that he does not attempt , as Mr. Wells does , to break down the boundaries between the literary genres , and to make the novel serve at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a philosophical dissertation . Respecting the personalities of his dramatis personce , wishing to preserve the sharpness of their outlines in their own atmosphere , he does not impute to them his ideas nor set them to discussing them . With a restraint unusual among English novelists , he refrains from " editorial " comment upon his " news . " When he wishes to set forth his ideas , he writes a book of popular philosophy : " Mental Efficiency , " " The Feast of St. Friend , " " The Plain Man and his Wife . " If these books were as well known to the American public as the novels are , we should hear no more in this country about Mr. Bennett 's lack of ideas . On the contrary , all our women 's clubs would be debating , in their eager , simple-hearted fashion , " The Philosophy of Arnold Bennett . " Mr. Darton , more sophisticated than our fellow-countrywomen , says in effect that the philosophy of Mr. Bennett is not worth discussing . The works named above have been advertised in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strong , vital thinking . " But , he continues , " ' big , strong , vital thinking ' is just what these remarkable little books do not contain . They contain the completest common-sense , expressed with astonishing simplicity and directness , and based upon unimpeachable honesty of outlook . They are a guide to efficiency , to self-help , to practical idealism , to alertness of intelligence , to sinewy culture , to every high quality which every crass Briton has always thought the crass Briton does not show . The United Kingdom is . . . almost overstocked with agencies for the purpose , from the physical energies of Mr. Sandow to the benevolent writings of the late Lord Avebury . . . . They are quite perfect lay sermons . But " ? and this is the damning word ? " they are not original . " I perfectly agree that Mr. Bennett 's general ideas are not " original , " and commend his judgment in not tying up his art to anything so transitory as a " new " philosophy . I object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that because they are old they are dead or deficient in strength and vitality . I will not stand upon the word " big , " a term which should be reserved for the use of advertising managers and radical reformers . But I can not reconcile Mr. Darton 's description of these books as guides to every high quality needed by the crass Briton with his assertion that there is no criticism in the Five Towns novels , except on what seems to me the untenable assumption that Mr. Bennett , the popular novelist , and Mr. Bennett , the popular philosopher , are distinct and non-communicating beings . The beginning of wisdom , according to this philosophy , which runs counter to our current naturalism , is the recognition of a fundamental duality in human experience . Mr. Bennett presumes not God to scan , but looking into himself as a microcosm , reports that the universe consists of a power-tocontrol , which is the quintessence of man , and of a power-to-be-controlled , which is nature . The zest , the object , and the compensation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human over the natural power . " For me , " he says , " spiritual content ( I will not use the word ' happiness , ' which implies too much ) springs from no mental or physical facts . It springs from the spiritual fact that there is something higher in man than the mind , and that something can control the mind . Call that something the soul , or what you will . My sense of security amid the collisions of existence lies in the firm consciousness that just as my body is the servant of my mind , so is my mind the servant of me . An unruly servant , but a servant  --  and possibly getting less unruly every day ! Often have I said to that restive brain : ' Now , 0 mind , sole means of communication between the one and all external phenomena , you are not a free agent ; you are subordinate ; you are nothing but a piece of machinery ; and obey me you shall . ' " The responsibility for extending the dominion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his remoter circumstances , Mr. Bennett , in opposition to our popular sociological doctors , places primarily upon the individual . While Mr. Wells , for example , urges us to cast our burdens and our sins upon society , and goes about beating up enthusiasm for schemes to improve the " mind of the race " by leagues of Samurai and legislative enactments , Mr. Bennett fixes his eye upon plain John Smith , and says : " I am convinced that we have already too many societies for the furtherance of our ends . To my mind , most societies with a moral aim are merely clumsy machines for doing simple jobs with a maximum of friction , expense , and inefficiency . I should define the majority of these societies as a group of persons each of whom expects the others to do something very - wonderful . Why create a society in order to help you perform some act which nobody can perform but yourself ? " Arnold Bennett says disappointingly little about that " big " idea , " the mind of the race . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the backbone of the nation , " it resolves itself under his realistic gaze into the by-him-no-less-admired but certainly less generally impressive spinal columns of John Smith and other homely vertebrates . In dealing with the relations of John Smith to Mrs. Smith , the Victorian Bennett feels obliged to say , in opposition to those who hold out for these plain people the prospect of a life of freedom and sustained ecstasy to be attained by upsetting the established social and economic order , that the ideas of freedom and ecstasy are romantic will-o ' - the- wisps . In the recent " evolution " of society he perceives rapid changes for the better in living conditions and a gradual amelioration of manners and tastes , but no significant alteration in the elements of human nature . " Passionate love , " he insists , " does not mean happiness ; it means excitement , apprehension , and continually renewed desires . " " Luxury , " he adds , " according to the universal experience of those who have had it , has no connection whatever with happiness . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist save for short periods of self-deception which are followed by terrible periods of reaction . Real practicable happiness is due primarily not to any kind of environment , but to an inward state of mind . Real happiness consists , first , in an acceptance of the fact that discontent is a condition of life , and , ondly , In an honest endeavor to adjust duct to an ideal . " It must infuriate an advocate of moral revolution and loose fluent sensuality , like Mr. Wells , to hear Mr. Bennett , bracketed with him as a leader of the new school , asserting that " the great principles , spiritual and moral , remain intact . " It must perplex an apologist for moral anarchy and strident self-assertion like Mr. Dreiser to find a fellow-realist declaring that " after all the shattering discoveries of science and conclusions of philosophy , mankind has still to live with dignity amid hostile nature , " and that mankind can succeed in this tremendous feat only " by the exercise of faith and of that mutual good-will which is based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both beyond measure is this able craftsman 's exposition of the relation of moral conventions to artistic form . " What form is in art , conventions are in life . . . . No art that is not planned in form is worth consideration , and no life that Is not planned in conventions can ever be satisfactory . . . . The full beauty of an activity is never brought out until it is subjected to discipline and strict ordering and nice balancing . A life without petty artificiality would be the life of a tiger in the forest . . . . Laws and rules , forms and ceremonies , are good in themselves , from a merely esthetic point of view , apart from their social value and necessity . " These are the ideas of a man who has taken his stand against Mr. Wells 's Utopia on the one hand and against Mr. Dreiser 's jungle on the other . As old as civilized society , they have the conservative complexion of all traditional and enduring things . They are not worth discussing if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not appear vital till they are denied . Ordinarily a novelist has not needed consciously to concern himself with them , unless he has intended to trample them under foot . But in the face of the present naturalistic invasion , when humanistic ideas are in the trenches , fighting for existence , a novelist who paints men in preference to tigers , supermen , or scientific angels , has interestingly taken sides . III . The general theme of Mr. Bennett 's masterpieces , determined by the central interest of his philosophy , is the development of character in relation to a society which is also developing . He has no foolishly simple mechanical formula for expressing the nature of the relation between the individual and the social process . He has rather a sense that this relationship involves an interplay of forces of fascinating and inexplicable complexity . His sense of the marvellous intricacy of his theme explains his elaborate presentation of the community life in which his principal figures have their being . He is bent upon bringing before the eye of the reader every scrap of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " case . " The reader who believes that character is determined mainly by inherited physiological traits finds in the Five Towns novels a physiological account of three successive generations . The reader who holds that education is the significant factor is abundantly supplied with the educational history of father and children and grandchildren . The reader who lays stress upon a changing environment and the pressure of the hour sees how from decade to decade and from year to year the hero or heroine is housed and clothed and fed and occupied and amused ; and wrought upon by parents and children and relatives and friends and servants and strangers ; and subjected to the influences of social customs and business and politics and religion and art and books and newspapers transmitting to the thick local atmosphere the pressure of the world outside . The reader who looks for the main currents of the nineteenth century in the Five Towns discovers the Clayhanger family and their neighbors developing in relation to the democratic movement , the Industrial revolution , the decay of dogmatic theology , the extension of scientific thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diffusion of aesthetic consciousness . One 's first impression before this spectacle is of admiration at the unrelenting artistic energy which keeps this presented community life whole and steady yet perceptibly in motion through a long span of time . One 's second impression is of admiration at the force of composition which keeps the principal figures from being " swamped " in the life of the community . They are immersed in it and dyed in it and warped and battered and grooved by it ; yet they are never made to appear as its impotent creatures ; somehow they are made to emerge above their " environment " as its creators and preservers  --  its plain , grim , but enduring heroes . The secret of this " somehow " is that Mr. Bennett implicitly recognizes as an artist what he explicitly declares as a popular philosopher , namely , the existence in the individual of something deeper than the body , deeper than the mind  --  an ultimately responsible , independent , spiritual self , with the power to control , in some measure , its circumstances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he tells us that the originating impulse of that work was a conviction that a " heart-rending novel " might be written to express " the extreme pathos in the fact that every stout , ageing woman was once a young girl with the unique charm of youth in her form and movements and in her mind . " The theme as he states it is only the threadbare platitude of Cavalier poetry  --  the deciduousness of physical beauty ; and its pathos is only skin deep . But the theme as he develops it is the spiritual truth sung by the Puritan ? " only a sweet and virtuous soul , like seasoned timber , never gives " ; and its pathos is indeed heartrending . Constance and Sophia , the two heroines of " The Old Wives ' Tale , " appeal to tragic compassion not because they were young and fair and have grown old and grotesque , but because they hungered for love and life yet have quietly and proudly starved in their respectability rather than touch a morsel of forbidden food . After a considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the naturalistic school , one begins to feel that the resisting power of formed character has vanished from the earth . I shall not soon forget the sigh of relief that I uttered when I came upon a certain passage in the story of Sophia 's resistance to the various invitations of Parisian sensuality . The poor girl in her loneliness craving for sympathy and affection finds her physical and mental self responding involuntarily to the ardent wooing of the kindly Chirac . " ' My dear friend , ' ho urges with undaunted confidence , you must know that I love you . ' She shook her head impatiently , all the time wondering what it was that prevented her from slipping into his arms . " She does not slip into his arms ; and one rejoices  --  not because one 's moral sense is , gratified , but simply because one is pleased to find occasionally a novelist who recognizes an inhibited impulse , in the sexual connection , as among the interesting " facts of life . " Though the self of a person with the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a defined centre , about which the framework of character may be built . Mr. Bennett portrays persons with various powers of inhibition , but his heroes have , or achieve , character . The interest of his story centres in the deliberate acts of rational beings , who are conscious , like Hilda Less-ways , of their miraculous power to " create all their future by a single gesture " ; and so the rich mass of his observations becomes a coherent illustration of human responsibility . The Clayhanger trilogy , triumphantly completed by the publication of " These Twain , " expresses with the moving force of dramatic representation the ideas more simply exposed in " The Plain Man and His Wife . " The first volume has for its theme the development of the character of Edwin Clayhanger from the eager formlessness of his boyhood to the steadiness , honesty , application , efficiency , solidity , tolerance , justice , and self-control of his manhood . The theme of the second volume is the development of the character of Hilda Lessways from the innocent , ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matrimonial adventure , to the vibrant , hopeful , open-eyed egoism and rather grim determination of early womanhood . The theme of the third volume is the further development of this " dynamic " and that " static " character through the difficult and at times almost baffling process of adapting themselves to living together as man and wife . Taken together , the three novels constitute an impressive criticism of Mr. Wells 's theory of the life of sustained ecstasy and , if you please , of Mr. Dreiser 's theory of the life of ruthless animality . It is clear that Mr. Bennett has attempted to present in the completed trilogy an ade ' quate account of the fiery conflict , with typical antagonists , of the Eternal-Feminine with the Eternal-Masculine . ' If you are a man , you will writhe , or you ought to writhe , at the exposure in Edwin of your own obstinate conviction that you think straight and that your wife does not , and at the exposure of your hot fits of indignation at her shifty evasions of your flawless argument . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or you ought to blush , at the exposure in Hilda of your own illogicality and your willingness to gain ends  --  commendable no doubt  --  by perfectly unscrupulous means . Hilda respects and loves her husband deeply , but she is irritated by his colds , by his little set habits , by the deliberateness of his temper , and by the inarticulateness of his appreciation of her . Edwin loves his wife and feels the charm and force of her personality ; but he distrusts her intellect and can not entirely approve of her morality . He is exasperated by her interference in his business . He keenly resents the injustice in which she involves him through acts inspired by her ambition for him and by her passionate and jealous devotion to the advancement of their own family interests . She develops social aspirations in which he does not share , and a desire for a style of living which promises him increased burdens with no added satisfactions . Their common effort seems to multiply luxuries and superficial refinements without in the least sweetening or deepening or strengthening their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense self-commiseration that the great complex edifice of his business , " with its dirt , noise , crudity , strain , and eternal effort , " exists solely that Hilda may exist " in her elegance , her disturbing femininity , her restricted and deep affections , her irrational capriciousness , and her strange , brusque common-sense . " He asks himself in poignant self-pity : " Where do I come in. ? " After repeated scenes of domestic tension he walks out of his house and home with hot brain and twitching nerves . He mutters to himself : " She wo n't alter her ways  --  and I sha' n't stand them . " In what he takes for ultimate despair , he says to himself , " as millions of men and women have said to themselves , with awestruck calm : ' My marriage was a mistake . ' " But as this plain , average man wanders aimlessly through the streets of the Five Towns with tumult in his breast , confronting the ruin of his private universe , lie has an experience comparable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sultry Leith Walk he authentically took the Devil by the nose . When his brain cools and his nerves stop twitching and his formed character returns to its equilibrium , he has first a flashing intuition into a method by which he can reconcile himself to his " universe . " " It was banal ; it was commonplace ; it was what every one knew . Yet it was the great discovery of all his career . If Hilda had not been unjust in the assertion of her own individuality , there could be no merit in yielding to her .. . . He was objecting to injustice as a child objects to rain on a holiday . Injustice was a tremendous actuality ! It had to be faced and accepted . ( He himself was unjust . At any rate , he intellectually conceived that he must be , though honestly he could remember no instance of injustice on his part . ) To reconcile one 's self to injustice was the master achievement . . . . He yielded on the canal-bridge . And in yielding , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has found content by accepting discontent as a condition of life , and by honestly endeavoring to adapt his conduct to an ideal . In his recognition of the need of a more flexible intelligence and a stiffer backbone he embodies at once the principle of progress and the principle of conservation . He is the hero of his generation , not victorious but conquering . He can not stand like Benham in " The Research Magnificent , " and say , " I am Man . The Thought of the world . " But he might stand , if he had the habit of attitudinizing , and say , " I am a man . A vertebral unit in the backbone of the nation . " One can not plan a life in conventions without cutting out of it many wayward desires and " beautiful impulses . " The young lions tences out they came again , and went whirling around his head . Down came the Speaker 's gavel : " The gentleman 's time has expired ! " And Cannon dropped into his seat amid the roars of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for forty-three years , having received his first election to Congress in 1872 . From the day he entered the Capitol he has been a power there . In 1890 he was defeated for reelection . just as were McKinley and other advocates of the High Tariff Act of the Fifty-first Congress , but , after trying some one else for a single term , his constituents were glad to send him back to his old place The same thing has happened this time . There have been revolts against his authority as Speaker , and columns of newspaper space have been royally expended in showing what a bad man he is , and yet it does not seem possible to make most people believe it for long The truth undoubtedly is that , while no one can deny that Cannon has serious faults , he has also some compensating qualities which come into strong accentuation when his enemies overdo their censure of him . The professional labor element discovered this when they attempted to browbeat him into making over his committees so as to let in men whom they wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were reminded of it once more when they ran a candidate against him in his home district . The insurgents discovered it when they threatened to drive him out of the Speaker 's chair in mid-session . The Senators learned it when they opposed his effort to give the House its rightful share in legislation , because it meant a shortage in the " pork-barrel , " at which they had been helping themselves without stint for so many years . Cannon is not an elegant man . His ever-present tip-tilted cigar is sufficient evidence of that , to say nothing of his variegated vocabulary of denunciation . When a book-agent lured him into the purchase of a set of volumes which turned out , on examination , absurdly poor stuff , he wrote out his check to the order of the publishers , but endorsed it : " This check for $150 is in full settlement , both legal and moral , for an edition of which is not worth a single damn . We are never too old to learn , and the way your gentlemanly agent came it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Next to Thomas B. Reed , no man who has ever filled the Speaker 's chair has been so active in trying to reduce the waste of time in the House . Once the Invalid Pensions Committee turned in its usual crop of some hundreds of bills , most of them with favorable and unanimous reports , and the House accepted them in committee of the whole . If , in the regular session , they had been put through the usual process of reading every one by title and voting on it separately , they would have consumed an indefinite period for mere form 's sake . Cannon cut the matter short by proposing that , by unanimous consent , the House vote on them in a bunch . This was done , and in hardly more time than it takes to tell the story they had gone into the record as passed . The incident scandalized the strict constructionists , but saved hours of time , which the House was able to devote to other business , and the result was precisely the same . On another occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk in trying to pound the House into good order with his gavel , he handed the book of House rules to the clerk , and had the passage about etiquette read aloud . Members who had paid no attention to the gavel suddenly " took notice " when they discovered that they were violating the solemn rules of the House , and were individually liable to punishment . Cannon , who began life as a Quaker , and was read out of meeting because he persisted in marrying the girl of his choice , in spite of her not belonging to the same body , has lived to help bury the elders who condemned him for his non-conformity . He is about eighty years old now , and expects to live to be a hundred . He was asked once for his rules of living , and these were what he cited in response : " Honor thy father and thy mother " Take no thought of the morrow ; do n't worry .
