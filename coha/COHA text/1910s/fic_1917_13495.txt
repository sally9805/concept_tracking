TIME : Present . April afternoon . PLACE : The living-room of the Yellow House in Beulah , a New England village . SCENE : The room is clean , bare and empty , save for a few high-backed chairs sewed neatly up in burlap , and several trunks , barrels , and packing-boxes scattered about , each marked " Mrs. M. Carey , Beulah , N. H. " One barrel is conspicuously covered with labels : " Glass , " " Do n't Crush , " " Fragile , " " With Care . " The wall-paper is old , torn and stained in places , and the general air is that of a fine old New England house going to ruin from lack of care . There is a practical stairway leading to the upper rooms L. ; a closet underneath it ; doors opening R. and L. ; a window on each side of outer door , and a large old-fashioned fireplace with long Colonial mantel , R. At the side of this fireplace , but painted over the rest of the brickwork , showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen the little upper door of an old-fashioned " brick oven " ; and nearer the floor , in the accustomed place , the smaller door into which the fuel for cooking used to be put . All this is not too obvious , but is practically useful in the development of the story . The wide , double outer door at center back has small panes of glass ( leaded ) in its upper half . It is open and through the space may be seen the pillars supporting the portico . Up these pillars are growing the strong bare branches of a rambler rose , its leaves just starting to bud . A village road and a tiny river are seen in the distance . DISCOVERED : Through the open door can be seen OSSIAN POPHAM , optimist and philosopher . A man of fifty-five or sixty , of the kindly , humorous New England type ,  --  smooth face , twinkling eye , gray hair and spectacles  --  shirt sleeves and overalls . He is heard singing cheerfully " There Is a Happy Land . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barrel on the steps . After a moment he rolls the barrel into the room . Going R. , he comes back with a broom , still singing , and brushes up the excelsior and scraps of paper , small pieces of wood , etc. , which are on the floor . During this he stops to pick up an imaginary pin , then goes on with his work . He pulls up the window-shades at a different angle , scratches his head and surveys the room as if it were not as attractive as it might be  --  shifts the chairs , looks at his watch , and rolls the barrel he brought in into the room R. , singing all the while . After a moment there is the sound of a step outside and GILBERT CAREY , a handsome boy of fifteen or sixteen , comes into the doorway from R. His arms and hands are full of travelling-bags , suitcases , shawl-straps , etc . GILBERT ( Leaning across the door-sill and shouting ) Hello ! Anybody here ? Hi  --  I say ! Mr. Popham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two exchange the broad smiles of old acquaintance . ) Hello , Mr. Popham . The train was late . Had you given us up ? p. 3 POPHAM , MRS . ( Going toward outer door  --  R. of it ) Hello , Gilbert , hello ! Glad to see you ! Land ! You 've growed a foot since you was here last summer . GILBERT Take some of these things , will you ? I 'm all out of breath ! ( Drops a piece from each hand . ) POPHAM , MRS . ( Crosses to foot of stairs , placing suitcases on floor ) Where 's the rest o ' the folks ? GILBERT Coming  --  on the installment plan . The road 's full of ' em . They 'll be here in a minute if they can stop looking at the river . Nancy 's at the head of the procession , as usual . Catch , will you ? ( Throws shawl-strap to POPHAM , who puts it with rest of luggage . ) I 'm glued to this spot till the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wheel effect off C.R. ) POPHAM , MRS . ( Pushing back his spectacles ) How 's that ? GILBERT Why , nobody 's seen the inside of the house since we bought it , but me , you know . POPHAM , MRS . Yes , and what then ? GILBERT Well , Mother 's the Queen Bee in our family , and we 've all decided that she must go in first . p. 4 POPHAM , MRS . Oh , I see the point ! GILBERT I hear the wheels now . I 'll go and help them out . ( Exits C.R. ) ( NANCY 'S bright voice heard outside C.R. ) NANCY I 'm coming ! I could n't wait for the horse to stop . I just fell out ! You did n't go in , did you , Gilbert ? GILBERT ( Outside ) No , I told you I would n't . I 'll get Peter and the rest of the baggage . NANCY ( Comes into the frame of the doorway . She is a slender , pretty girl of seventeen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simple travelling dress and piquant , saucy hat . From the threshold , clasping her hands with delight ) Oh ! It 's all true ! The darling , darling Yellow House ! It 's ours and we 're here all safe ! ( Sees OSH POPHAM , who is slowing away bags in the corner . ) How de do , Mr. Popham ? You see , I know you 're Mr. Popham . POPHAM , MRS . ( Smiling broadly ) Hit it right the first time . Shake ! ( Wipes his hands on trousers and advances to her and shakes hands . ) NANCY And who do you think I am ? p. 5 POPHAM , MRS . ( With glee ) I bet you 're Nancy ! NANCY How did you guess ? POPHAM , MRS . You 're the one Gilbert calls the " pathfinder , " and I can see it stickin ' out all over you . NANCY ( Laughing ) The others will be here in a minute . Mother 's seeing about the trunks . ( She looks into room R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look in , is it ? POPHAM , MRS . There ai n't much to look at ! Everything 's in an awful mess . NANCY Oh , we 're used to moving . Father was a Captain in the Navy , you know . ( POPHAM laughs . ) Where 's the key to this door ? POPHAM , MRS . Right there in the keyhole . ( Points to it . ) NANCY It 'll only be a minute now . ( Takes key from inside and puts it in outside . Beckons to POPHAM . ) We 're going to lock the door , take the key out , hand it to mother , and she 'll unlock the door ; we 'll all come in together , and then  --  ( With a deep breath )  --  then we 'll be home ! p. 6 POPHAM , MRS . ( Slightly bewildered , but obeys orders ) Jest as you say . It 's terrible queer , but  --   --  ( Closing R. of C. doors . ) ( They go out and may be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of sight .

CAREY , about forty , a woman of unmistakable distinction and breeding , has the spirit of youth in her gentle , beautiful face , the deep tenderness of a mother and the merry brightness of a comrade for her children . She is dressed in simple black with white at the throat and wrists ; a hat with a brim and a transparent mourning veil thrown back sets rather like a halo on her soft hair . ( KATHLEEN is a charming girl of twelve , simple and happy . PETER , aged four or five , is all that chubby beauty , health and general lovableness can make him . He carries a pail of toys . POPHAM stands behind children , waiting . ) CAREY ( Crosses into C. Looks around , then , with hands on breast , utters a silent prayer . Turns and faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !

POPHAM remains outside in doorway . ) We 've crossed the threshold of our new home , children , and we 'll make it a sort of dedication , shall we ? ( They all cling to her , hiding their faces for an instant , then look up into her eyes . ) We must cling together closer than ever , now that we have to learn to live without father . ( Kisses GILBERT. ) p. 7 KATHLEEN We will , Muddy . PETER I 'll be good ! CAREY ( With arms about all ) You were only babies when father called you Mother Carey 's chickens , but you must go on living as he wished  --  learning to breast the storms when they come , to fly over the seas and warn sailors of danger , and show good birds the way home . We 've parted with our old house , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . ( MRS . CAREY kisses her . ) NANCY ( Brushing away a tear ) You sha n't be disappointed in us , Mother . ( MRS .

CAREY ( Crosses to KATHLEEN ) Yes , dear , but Gilbert finally bought it . Call Mr. Popham in , Gilbert . He 'll wonder what sort of a ceremony we are having in here . ( GILBERT crosses to C. door  --  ushers POPHAM in C. ) GILBERT ( R. of POPHAM ) This is Mr. Popham , Mother . ( Crosses to R. door  --  looks in  --  crosses at back at L. door  --  looks in , then crosses to baggage by steps and arranges it . KATHLEEN and PETER stay at L. ) p. 9 CAREY ( Shaking hands ) I 've heard so much about you from Gilbert . POPHAM , MRS . ( R. of MRS . CAREY ) And me the same about you ma'am .

CAREY crosses R. , puts PETER 'S pail and her handbag on trunk , and sits , taking off gloves and hat. ) p. 10 POPHAM , MRS . ( Comes D.C. ) Listen to ' em . You 'd think they 'd found a mansion in the skies . That boy Gilbert is a smart one . CAREY I let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he needed the responsibility . POPHAM , MRS . Jest so , jest so . Well , it 'll seem good to see these old windows lit up ag'in . I 've had charge here now for fifteen years , but it ai n't never been lived in but summer . The Hamiltons are scattered all over the globe ; there was never any two of them wanted to stay in the same spot . CAREY I knew the one who sold it to us lived in England . POPHAM , MRS . Yes . Lem 's American " counsel " over there . Mis ' Lem and the two Hamilton girls do n't stay with him ; they like Paris better , and one of the sons works in China . ( Crosses to C. door . ) NANCY ( Flying downstairs , KATHLEEN after her . GILBERT carries PETER down and sends him to MRS . CAREY .

CAREY Go and look . ( PETER runs out C. door . POPHAM follows and shows him the river off R. ) NANCY ( Taking mother 's hand ) Oh , Mother , do go up . There are the loveliest surprises , and unexpected cupboards and things . My room 's next to yours . KATHLEEN And mine 's going to be a weeny one round the corner . ( GILBERT enters on stairs . ) NANCY And Gilbert could have the one at the end of the hall . GILBERT ( Drops D.L. ) You need n't mind picking my room . I can do that myself .

POPHAM comes into C. ) NANCY But that would n't leave any for Julia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ann ? ( POPHAM drops R.C. ) p. 12 CAREY We need n't plan for Julia yet , and we can double up for the few days that Cousin Ann 's with us . KATHLEEN If Julia lives with us , she 's sure to want the best room . ( NANCY goes out C. and picks a leaf from rambler . ) POPHAM , MRS . I 'm real glad you 're goin ' to have a cousin  --  somebody that 'll take holt . Mis ' Popham wo n't never have no help round the house  --  especially relations . She says relations eat the most and work the least of anybody . When 's your cousin comin ' ? ( Crosses to L.C. ) KATHLEEN She is n't the kind that tells  --  she 's just the kind that comes . ( Crosses to C. ) Ugh ! Is n't it cold here ? ( Goes out C. ) POPHAM , MRS . ( Crosses to hamper L. ) Well , what do you expect ?

PETER gets on box L.C. ) NANCY ( Enters C. with bit of rambler stalk ) This dear crimson rambler knows it 's May , anyway , for I see the leaf buds swelling . That 's my rambler , Mr. Popham . ( KATHLEEN is back L. POPHAM enters L. ) p. 13 KATHLEEN ( Drops L. of POPHAM ) She and father planted it . ( Crosses to GILBERT and watches him unwrap chair . ) POPHAM , MRS . That so ? NANCY You see , we were on a driving trip , years ago , and we ate our lunch out in front , and peeped in the windows and fell in love with the place ; and father wished we could spend the summer here ; and before we drove away he said , " Let 's plant something to show that we 're thankful for the happy day we 've had . " ( Crosses to mother , speaking tenderly ) And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  so no wonder it buds . CAREY ( Putting hand out to NANCY ) And then the little daughter grew up , full of wonderful plans for making both ends meet . And when we had to have a new home , she remembered the Yellow House in Beulah , and here we are , Mr. Popham , your next-door neighbors . ( NANCY goes to steamer trunk up R. ) POPHAM , MRS . Well , I ai n't goin ' to grumble at that . ( Crosses L.C. ) CAREY ( Crosses to POPHAM ) Is it too late , or can you send us in some butter and eggs and flour tonight , Mr. Popham ? ( NANCY gets trunk keys from mother 's handbag , crosses to steamer trunk R. ) p. 14 POPHAM , MRS . ( Crosses U.L. to box , gets hat and coat by window ) Of course .

( Runs to NANCY , who comes C. ) NANCY ( Crosses D.R.C. with box of luncheon ) Let 's eat before Mr. Popham comes back . CAREY ( Crosses D.R. ) All right . Gilbert , get one of the barrels for a table . GILBERT This one do ? ( Gets barrel R.  --  Wheels it in front of trunk R.C. ) Cracky ! It 's heavy ! p. 15 NANCY Now move up some boxes . The trunk will do for mother . GILBERT You ought to run an employment bureau , Nancy . ( Gets small box up by door , for NANCY , and brings it down to barrel . ) KATHLEEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ) You can sit here , Mother , with my coat for a cushion . ( GILBERT takes pail of toys from trunk and puts it on floor at back . Sits on trunk , and hands sandwich to PETER and KATHLEEN . ) CAREY ( Sits on trunk  --  NANCY sits on box by barrel at L. , KATHLEEN same at R. ) Gilbert , where 's your hat ? ( GILBERT takes off hat and sits on trunk beside her . ) NANCY It is n't like coming to a strange house at all , but just as if father had chosen it for us . ( Looking L.C. ) Wo n't the big sofa look comfy over there ? KATHLEEN I 'm so glad we sold all the grand things . PETER Drink of water , please ! GILBERT ( Rises ) Peter , one would think you were fed on nothing but salt fish . ( Crosses L.C. Exits L. ) p. 16 PETER Can I have jelly on my bread ? ( NANCY rises , spreads bread with jelly , and gives it to PETER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Yes , Precious ! Eat , Mother dear , or it wo n't be a nice picnic . CAREY ( Making an effort ) I will . Does it taste good , Peterkin ? ( PETER , speechless with food , nods his head . GILBERT re-enters L. with long-handled dipper of water  --  crosses R.C. and hands it to NANCY . ) GILBERT I 'll pass it around , shall I ? And that 'll save washing five tumblers . ( Sits on box by barrel . NANCY gives PETER sip of water . ) Now how about some food for myself ? ( NANCY gives him an apple and sandwich . ) NANCY Mother dear , you 're thinking , not eating . ( Rises . ) Now come , cheer up . I feel as if father knew we 're in Beulah , and wanted us to be happy . CAREY Yes , I know . We 're all going to be brave and cheerful . The question of the moment is  --  your cousin Julia . Is she to live with us or not ? She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her place . She 's left much worse off than you , without father or mother . p. 17 GILBERT What makes me sore is that her father lost our father 's money . CAREY Gilbert ! That is something she must never know . PETER Of course not ! CAREY There  --  you hear the family oracle ? Well , what would your father have wanted his children to do for his brother 's daughter ? ( NANCY makes a gesture of resignation . ) GILBERT Oh , I suppose we 've got to . She 's a girl , and ca n't take care of herself . PETER I do n't want her . She ca n't play horse . KATHLEEN Mother , you always make us do such kind things ! ( Voices of driver , ANN and JULIA off C.R. They all listen . ) CHADWICK Stop here , driver ! CAREY What 's that ? CHADWICK ( Outside , calling with considerable force ) No , no , Julia . Do n't pay the man now . Let him wait . ( They all look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can it be  --  Cousin Ann ? ( All rise. ) p. 18 GILBERT Just like her to come before we 've got here ourselves . ( Crosses L. NANCY stays at barrel . KATHLEEN and MRS . CAREY also . ) KATHLEEN And where did she get Julia ?

PETER goes to KATHLEEN . GILBERT crosses U.L. ANN comes D.C.L. JULIA stays U.C. a moment . ) CAREY Ann ! Julia ! Where on earth did you come from ? CHADWICK Home , of course . You all look as if I was a ghost or a boa-constrictor . I knew you could n't take us in the first night , but there 's a hotel . ( MRS . CAREY crosses to ANN . JULIA crosses D.C. , shakes hands with NANCY and MRS . CAREY , giving them both hands . NANCY takes her R. to KATHLEEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NANCY stands L. of JULIA . ) CAREY But have they rooms for you ? CHADWICK Oh , yes , there seemed to be no boarders , just some offensive men sitting about a stove with their feet up ; the usual attitude . p. 19 JULIA ( With a shudder ) And spitting , Aunt Margaret ! CAREY Oh , I 'm sorry . And I ca n't even offer you a place to sit . Julia , you are a surprise . I thought you were with the Fergusons . JULIA ( Crosses to MRS . CAREY with injured air ) The Fergusons went abroad yesterday , Aunt Margaret , and left me without a word of warning . I had to go when they did and I even had to fold my own dresses ! CHADWICK So she came to me . I did n't let her unpack . You are used to girls and I am not . So I just brought her right along . ( Exchange of glances between CAREY children . ) CAREY Of course . It wo n't make any difference after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see that everything is done with system . Have you any help ? ( GILBERT crosses back of trunk D.L. ) NANCY ( Crosses R.C. ) Plenty . Mother 's the cook  --   --  KATHLEEN I 'm the chambermaid . NANCY I 'm the waitress. p. 20 GILBERT ( Down a bit ) I 'm the chore boy . PETER ( Advances ) And I 'm the assistant . CHADWICK Ought n't that child to be in bed ? ( PETER runs back stage . ) JULIA There does n't seem to be anything left for me . NANCY We need a dishwasher badly . JULIA ( Taking off gloves  --  looks lovingly at hands ) I 'm afraid I 'm  --  too inexperienced for that . NANCY Oh , you can learn . ( PETER tiptoes U.R. , plays with toys on pile of rugs . ) CHADWICK Get the girls away , Margaret . I want to talk with you . CAREY Nancy  --  you and Kathleen go and show Julia the old-fashioned kitchen . ( NANCY crosses to MRS . CAREY  --  turns and with KATHLEEN takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MRS . CAREY crosses R. GILBERT crosses L. up to stairs and sits . ) CHADWICK I never did approve of this sentimental move of yours , Margaret . p. 21 CAREY It was necessary to economize , Ann , and we had to have a home . ( Sits on trunk R. ) CHADWICK So , without my advice , you took your husband 's life insurance and sunk it in this tumbledown place . Now you 've got no income left but his beggarly pension . CAREY If you had waited until everything was in order , you would be more in sympathy with our undertaking , Cousin Ann . CHADWICK ( Closes door L. , then crosses to C. ) I should if it had n't been for Julia . I never could get on with Julia , I 'm too positive . You can get on with anybody . Besides , I knew you 'd never look at the plumbing . ( Crosses to MRS . CAREY . ) GILBERT There is n't any plumbing , Cousin Ann . CAREY The house is a hundred years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks it . What are you going to do with it ? CAREY ( Quietly ) Live in it , and love it . CHADWICK Love your Granny ! Of course it 's as cold as a barn . Any furnace ? p. 22 GILBERT ( Rises  --  steps D.L. ) No , and no elevator , or electric lights , nor fountains  --   --  CHADWICK Hold your tongue , Gilbert . ( GILBERT goes U.L. and sits as before . ) Have you had the well water tested ? CAREY We only arrived this afternoon , Ann . CHADWICK Why did n't you attend to it before you arrived ? ( Looks at dipper of water on barrel . ) Have the well cleaned out at once . But never tell me what you find in it . Now here 's what I 'll do . ( She crosses L.C. Sits on box . ) Since you 've spent your last dollar on this place , I 'll pay for putting in good plumbing and a furnace . You 're a sentimental idiot , but I do n't want you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  GILBERT also shows appreciation ) Cousin Ann ! ( The three girls come in from kitchen L. KATHLEEN first , JULIA and NANCY follow . They stand L. ) CHADWICK ( Rises ) Do n't thank me . You know I hate to be thanked . ( Crosses U.C. ) Now , I suppose if I ca n't be of any more use tonight , we 'd better go back to the hotel . We have the most incompetent horse and the rudest driver I ever saw . ( MRS . CAREY crosses U.R . of C. door. ) p. 23 JULIA ( Crosses R. of GILBERT , U.L. ) Really impertinent . When I asked him if he had n't a better trap for us , he said if we did n't like this one , the walking was good ! ( GILBERT and children laugh . ) CHADWICK You must n't expect to find manners in these benighted villages , Julia . Come . JULIA ( Crosses to ANN ) Good-bye . ( Exits . ) CHADWICK I 'll send our trunks over in the morning , Margaret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Running to C. door ) Do send over your trunks , Cousin Ann .

All chanting the chorus . ) SONG GILBERT She called us names till she was tired . NANCY She called us names till we perspired . KATHLEEN She called us names we never could spell . p. 24 GILBERT She called us names we never may tell . CHORUSShe called us names that made us laugh , She called us names for a day and a half , She called us names till her memory failed , But finally out of our sight she sailed .

Of course we 've loved the house for years . LALLIE JOY You ai n't lived in it yet . It 's a terrible hard house to git along in  --  the kitchen 's so far from the dining-room , it makes a sight of steps . The big front door the Hamilton boys put in lets in an awful draught , the stairs ai n't planned convenient , and most of the bedrooms is on the north side .

( POPHAM gets hat from piano . ) NANCY It was only a meeting of the Cabinet , and we 've just finished . ( Crosses U. to piano . ) OSSIAN Well , I must skeddadle . ( Crosses to C. door . ) NANCY Come back early . OSSIAN Do n't worry . Maria never misses the opening prayer . GILBERT I 've got a bully scheme I want to talk to you about some time , Thurston , when I 'm not doing housework . ( Exits L. , taking ladder . ) THURSTON ( Calling after him ) Good ! p. 57 NANCY ( Crosses to sofa L.  --  takes up pillow ) It 's too wonderful the way you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Crosses to front of C. table  --  looks at curtains ) Athletics did it . Anything I can do to help ? Does n't the room look charming , now that the curtains are finished ? NANCY Like them ? These pillows do n't behave very well . ( RALPH takes one end of pillow she is holding  --  she puts slip over it . ) There , is n't that pretty , Mr. Thurston ? THURSTON Do n't you think it 's about time you dropped the " Mr. " ? NANCY I never thought  --  would you like me to ? THURSTON Of course . It marks a stage in friendship , does n't it ? NANCY All right , Ralph  --  Ralph  --  it 's a nice name . I like it . ( Crosses to armchair  --  gets flowers . RALPH laughs . ) What are you laughing at ? ( Crosses to table U.L.  --  puts flowers in vase and water also . ) THURSTON Oh , nothing . It 's only that you 're so honest . Most girls have a lengthy conversation when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . ( Crosses U. to stairs  --  leans on post. ) p. 58 NANCY ( Crosses to back of C. table ) But how silly . You said , " Will you ? " and I said , " Yes . " But I take it back , because it does n't sound respectful to a teacher . THURSTON I could afford to dispense with a little respect if  --   --  NANCY ( R. ) Now , do n't you think the room looks as if we 'd lived in it for ages ? ( Crosses to C. table , picks up books and work-basket , and puts them on the piano , leaving dress on table for JULIA . ) THURSTON ( Crosses to back of C. table ) Yes , it 's like heaven to me , this house . And when I think how I felt about coming to Beulah ; I had failed to get the school I was trying for in Boston  --  I 'd worked my way through college , counting the days till I could go to teaching , and then nothing turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how small it seemed . ( Sits on armchair arm , takes up flowers from seat of chair . ) THURSTON ( Crosses R.C. ) And how different it looks now . I had made up my mind to bite hard into my job and make the best of it , but instead of that I 've been happier than I have ever been in my life . p. 59 NANCY ( Innocently ) Have you told that to mother ? She 'll be so happy . ( Gets on footstool . ) THURSTON It  --  it 's knowing you . NANCY ( Puts flowers in vase on mantel ) I 'm glad you like us . And you 're such a nice , understanding sort of friend . It seems easy to be friends in the country , does n't it ? THURSTON I love the country , but the salary 's too small . I 've never cared a hang about money before , but now I want  --  oh , how I want it ! NANCY Why ? I know you 'll succeed ! You 're young , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( Looking at her with meaning )  --  I want more than that . JULIA ( Enters L.  --  crosses L.C. ) Oh ! I beg your pardon . NANCY ( Gets down from stool ) Why should you beg our pardons ? JULIA ( Crosses to back of table ) Good afternoon , Mr. Thurston . I do n't want to intrude , but your mother asked me to finish this sewing , Nancy . ( Picks up sewing from table. ) p. 60 NANCY Intrude ! JULIA Oh  --  sensitive people always know when they are de trop ! NANCY Goodness , Julia . What a speech ! THURSTON ( Crosses to her ) You are always welcome , Miss Julia ! I 'm sure you realize that . JULIA Oh , thank you ! ( NANCY looks bewildered . ) THURSTON ( Embarrassed ) Well , I must go . JULIA Pray do n't let me drive you away . I can take my sewing upstairs . ( Starts L. ) THURSTON No , no , I beg of you . I want to see Mrs. Carey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little while . ( Exits L. JULIA sits R. of table and sews . ) NANCY Good-bye . ( Crosses back of C. table . ) What makes you act so queerly ? Do n't you like Ralph Thurston ? JULIA Naturally I 'm not interested in a country school teacher , when I 've met so many distinguished men at the Fergusons ' . p. 61 NANCY He 's more than a country teacher ; he 's going to have a boys ' school of his own and do big things some time . ( Drops L. of table . ) JULIA Of course you think he 's wonderful . NANCY I certainly do . JULIA You 're frank , to say the least . NANCY Why should n't I be ? I like Ralph Thurston and I ca n't bear to have you sneer at him . JULIA I 'm sorry . I 'll try to be careful , but the whole thing bores me so sometimes that I forget . NANCY The whole  --   --  ( Sits L. of table . ) What thing ? JULIA Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 've been accustomed to . I wonder if Aunt Margaret would mind if I did n't come down this evening . A house-warming in company with the Pophams and Sam Berry , the country storekeeper , and doughnuts and lemonade for refreshments is n't exactly my kind . NANCY ( Rises and faces her at front of table ) How can you say that , Julia Carey ? How dare you ? We would n't be having doughnuts and lemonade and doing our own work if your father had n't lost my father 's money . p. 62 JULIA What do you mean ? NANCY ( Passionately ) Yes . We had to give up everything and come here to live on the littlest bit we possibly could , with mother cooking and working and smiling as if she loved it , and you acting like a parlor ornament and daring to complain . JULIA ( Rising ) It is n't true ! It ca n't be ! ( She sees MRS . CAREY entering . ) NANCY It is true . That 's why we 're here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CAREY enters L. , wearing white apron . NANCY crosses to sofa . ) Mother ! Did n't Uncle Allan lose father 's money ? Julia sneers at the way we live , and the Pophams and everything . Ossian Popham 's the dearest man in the world , and she 's too snobbish to appreciate him . ( Crosses in front of sofa . ) CAREY Nancy ! How could you have broken faith and told Julia ? How could you ? NANCY ( Faces audience  --  overwhelmed ) Oh , Mother ! JULIA ( Speaks at the same time  --  with NANCY  --  passionately ) Was it true , Aunt Margaret ? p. 63 CAREY It is true , Julia  --  ( JULIA sinks into chair , sobbing )  --  but nothing for you to be ashamed of . Your father meant to return the money , but he never could . That was his misfortune and ours . ( Looks at NANCY ) And we promised each other never to speak of it ! I am bitterly disappointed in you , Nancy . NANCY Oh , Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how Julia makes every bone in my body , every hair on my head , ache to tell her what I think of her ! ( Sits . ) JULIA ( Sobbing  --  head on table ) I 'm a girl without a home , and Nancy treats me like this . CAREY You 're not without a home , Julia . You 're one of us now , and if you feel yourself an outsider , it 's because you refuse to take your share of our duties and our pleasures . NANCY ( Covering face with hands ) Oh , Mother , I 'm so ashamed ! I ca n't look you in the face . CAREY ( Crosses to L. of table  --  to both girls ) You 're both members of the same family . The only thing for you to do is to try and forgive each other . p. 64 NANCY ( Rises , crosses to front to C. MRS . CAREY stays L.C. ) Julia , let 's be friends . I do n't know how I came to forget myself . ( Putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll make it up somehow  --  I will , Julia . JULIA ( Rises ) I do n't think I can . ( Crosses swiftly to L.C. ) You 've hurt me too deeply . ( Goes swiftly upstairs . ) NANCY She 's impossible , Mother . ( Crosses to fireplace . ) CAREY No , she is n't . Remember her provocation . Do you know what I think ? We 've been so absorbed in making our new home that perhaps we 've neglected Julia . ( KATHLEEN enters L. , followed by GILBERT . ) KATHLEEN Is my skirt finished ? Why  --   --  Nancy ! ( Crosses L. ) GILBERT ( Crosses to front of table ) What 's the matter , Sis ? CAREY Julia 's the matter . KATHLEEN AND GILBERT Why ? CAREY ( R.C. ) Somehow we have n't taken her into the heart of the family . She is lonely and unhappy . p. 65 KATHLEEN ( L. ) Has she been cross to Nancy ? Because I wo n't have it . ( Stamps her foot . ) GILBERT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be " buttered up " every minute . CAREY If that is your opinion , you 've probably shown it very plainly at times , but have you done anything to change her attitude ? NANCY ( R.  --  passionately ) I ca n't even try . I ca n't love her enough . I have to love anybody like fury to be good . GILBERT You ca n't make over Julia . She was finished when she was born ! CAREY Then how about making Julia make herself over ? ( Gravely ) Have you read your Water Babies lately ? ( Crosses to NANCY . ) Was n't there something about fighting your way under the Ice Pack to get a glimpse of Shiny Wall and Peacepool ? ( Pause  --  crosses back and exits L. ) KATHLEEN ( After a pause  --  sits on sofa L. ) Is n't mother the most interesting scolder ? NANCY ( With her whole heart ) She 's far more than that . It 's this way : First , there 's mother , and then all around mother there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( With deep breath )  --  come all the other people ! p. 66 GILBERT ( Leaning against C. table ) Makes me feel like a worm ! KATHLEEN Me , too . NANCY ( Crosses to GILBERT , puts arms around him ) Never mind ! Here 's for a dive under the Ice Pack ! GILBERT Ice Pack 's an awful good name for Julia . KATHLEEN Sometimes I wish Kingsley had never written the Water Babies  --  it 's such hard work living up to it . NANCY I 've been the worst . Yes , you do n't know it , but I have ! And now I 've got to be the best ! Skip away and dress . ( GILBERT crosses and exits upstairs  --  KATHLEEN follows and stops on the steps . ) I 'll be up as soon as I finish these vines . I 'm going to trim the chandelier . KATHLEEN ( On stairs ) Nancy , do n't tell anybody tonight that my new dress is an old one of yours . NANCY ( Carrying JULIA 'S sewing to piano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet as honey in it . KATHLEEN I 'd look sweeter in one of my own ! And Nancy , let 's coax mother to wear her grey dress tonight  --  the one father used to love . p. 67 NANCY Oh , that will be dear . We 'll try . ( KATHLEEN exits upstairs . NANCY draws mahogany table near C. and climbs on it , trying to fasten some green garlands over chandelier . Pause . Then there is a knock at the outer door . ) Come in ! ( Pause . ) Just a minute , please . ( NANCY does not look at the visitor , absorbed in her task , the green garlands in her hands and round her neck . ) ( TOM HAMILTON opens the door . He is good looking , twenty-five , with personal charm and easy manners of one who has seen something of the world . Regards the pretty apparition on the table with surprise and boyish admiration . ) HAMILTON I beg pardon . ( Backs . ) Does Mrs. Carey live here ? NANCY Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Much amused ) May I see her ? NANCY ( Much occupied ) She 's awfully busy , but  --   --  HAMILTON This evening , perhaps ? NANCY This evening she 'll be awfully busier  --  Would tomorrow do ? HAMILTON Tomorrow  --  ( Disappointed . ) Oh , very well , then . ( Retreats from sight a few steps . She turns and sees the doorway vacant. ) p. 68 NANCY Why , where is he ? HAMILTON ( Returning ) By the way , are n't you Miss Nancy Carey ? NANCY Yes . HAMILTON May I come in , then ? NANCY I thought you were in ! HAMILTON I was , almost ! NANCY How did you know me ? HAMILTON Well , I knew that Mrs. Carey lives here , and I 've seen you before . NANCY Where ? I thought I knew everyone in Beulah  --  but I have n't seen you , have I ? HAMILTON No . It 's been my misfortune  --  but you have not . NANCY Then how have you seen me ? HAMILTON In a picture  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you justice . NANCY Dear me , I 'll have to come down . I ca n't die of curiosity on the table . I was just trying to put these vines  --   --  HAMILTON Let me do it . ( Springs on table beside her. ) p. 69 NANCY Oh , be careful ! Our furniture 's awfully tippy . I ca n't quite reach that high place  --   --  ( He takes branch and puts it on highest ring of chandelier . ) It 's easy for you  --   --  ( Interpolate business TOM and NANCY with vines . Pause . ) Now do get down , please , for if you want to see mother I must find her , and you would n't like meeting her on the table . HAMILTON ( Fixing the garland ) All right , when I finish this . ( With arms akimbo . ) Though I do like the climate up here  --  and  --  the view . ( Looking around ) The room is beautiful now . Much more so than when I saw it last . NANCY Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAMILTON I 've been away , yes . ( Getting down L.C. and looking at chandelier ) Well , is that right ? NANCY ( Laughing ) Just ! I 'm so much obliged ! And now that you know I 'm Nancy Carey , why do you keep on looking at me as if you were not quite certain after all ? HAMILTON Because I think perhaps you 're  --  something more . p. 70 NANCY Let me see . I 'm the elder daughter . HAMILTON Yes . NANCY I 'm the family pathfinder . HAMILTON Yes . NANCY And mother 's right-hand man  --   --  HAMILTON Yes . NANCY Well ? HAMILTON Oh ! Nothing in particular . You are  --  you ! Perhaps that 's all . Will you come down to earth now  --  and my level ? ( Crosses to table . ) NANCY Yes , thank you . ( Takes his hand and jumps down  --  crosses to front of table . ) Now will you tell me who you are ? I suspect a summer boarder . HAMILTON Wrong ! Perhaps this will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rose in it . ) NANCY ( Takes rose ) A rose ? It 's old and faded . HAMILTON Not so awfully old . NANCY It looks like one of our ramblers . HAMILTON ( Smiling ) It is one of " our " ramblers . p. 71 NANCY ( Hands it back ) How did you get it ? HAMILTON You sent it to me  --  indirectly . Now do n't you know ? NANCY ( Drawing back ) You 're not  --   --  ? HAMILTON Yes , I am  --  Tom Hamilton . When I got my father 's letter I made a bee line to Beulah . ( NANCY 'S smile fades . ) What 's the matter ? NANCY ( Facing front ) Nothing . HAMILTON What has Tom Hamilton done to make you look like this ? NANCY I did n't mean to be rude . ( Extends hand . ) How do you do all over again , Mr. Tom Hamilton ? ( Shakes hands . ) HAMILTON I believe you 're sorry I came . NANCY I 'm not , really . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose ? HAMILTON My father sent it to me  --  with your picture . NANCY Why did he do that ? HAMILTON Because he knew that when I came back I 'd come straight to this house . So he took this way of telling me what kind of people I 'd find here . Have I blundered in coming ? I 'm sorry , but it was necessary . This is a very important day to me  --  my twenty-fifth birthday . p. 72 NANCY Oh ! HAMILTON What is it ? NANCY Nothing . I was just surprised that it should be anybody 's birthday , that 's all ! HAMILTON Dear old Granny Hamilton always put my birthday presents in that brick oven  --  ( Pointing )  --  ever since I was a little codger , and just before she died she asked me to promise that I 'd never look in our post box again till I was twenty-five , when I 'd find the biggest gift of all . Do you wonder that I 'm excited ? And may I look now , please ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Nervously ) Had n't you better wait just a little ? Come back and call on mother in about an hour when she 's finished cooking , and then come to the house-warming party tonight ? We 're going to light the first fire on the hearth and do lots of lovely things . HAMILTON Are you sure you want me ? For my part , I think it 's a very happy coincidence  --  a member of the old reigning family welcoming the new , as it were . NANCY ( Struggling for ease ) Oh , yes , you must see mother . HAMILTON ( Takes hat from table ) I 'll come back in an hour , then , and tonight I 'll see the Yellow House in holiday attire . ( L.C. ) We shall be old acquaintances then , you and I. p. 73 NANCY Yes , do come back , and you can find what you 're looking for , then . HAMILTON ( Looking at NANCY ) Perhaps . I hope so . ( Glances about room  --  crosses L.C.U.  --  NANCY crosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream come true , somehow . This house , a home , with a happy family in it . I can almost see Granny sitting by the fire , smiling  --   --  NANCY ( Steps back U.R. ) I 'll step back . I do n't belong in the dream . HAMILTON ( Crosses to her , back of table ) I 'm not so sure ! Granny used to say : " Tom , when I 'm gone , do n't let anybody live in the old house who does n't love it . " You see , she came here a bride ; all her children were born here ; she buried her husband in Beulah churchyard ; the house was sacred to her . And when I learned that father had sold it , I could n't help coming to see if the tenants would  --   --  NANCY ( With a flickering smile ) Suit Granny ? ( Sighs . ) How can we tell ? HAMILTON I can tell . Nothing but love could make this room look as it does ! That 's why I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes , you know . p. 74 NANCY Yes  --  but oftener still  --  they do n't . HAMILTON Has one of yours disappointed you ? ( She nods . ) And wo n't come right ? ( She shakes her head . ) Perhaps you have n't tried quite hard enough . It seems to me that anything you wanted very much would come true . ( They look deeply at one another . ) NANCY ( Overcome with sudden shyness ) You 'll come , then  --  to see  --  mother ? HAMILTON ( With meaning ) Yes , and mother 's daughter ! Good-bye !  --  ( Shakes hands  --  crosses to C. door  --  for a little while .

HAMILTON ( Crosses to her and sits ) Was it long ago ? NANCY Not two years yet . Mother has seemed like a bird with one wing ever since : she tries to sing and to fly , but it 's different . She and father were so gay and happy  --  such friends . And we children just grew up in the sunshine without realizing what made it  --  till it was gone . Has it been long since you 've seen your father and mother ? HAMILTON ( With embarrassment ) I saw father three years ago . England is a long way from China ,  --  mother and the girls live in Paris , so of course I never see them . p. 81 NANCY Oh ! How hard for you ! We 've never been separated in our family .

Beulah is our village . The river is our river ; the neighbors are our neighbors . We belong to Beulah . HAMILTON I hope you have the same feeling for the Yellow House ?

THURSTON You could have a hundred whenever you want them . NANCY A hundred would be too many . I 'd rather have just a few dear ones . THURSTON Is that my place , with the few  --  friends ? NANCY Is n't it a nice place , Ralph ? Your voice does n't sound as if it were . THURSTON ( After a pause ) I suppose I must be content with it .

THURSTON It would be an ungrateful fellow who could be blue under this roof . CAREY It takes a very tight roof to keep the blues from coming in sometimes , Ralph .

LORD Well , it distracts him from learning a profession . p. 90 CAREY But do n't you consider him very gifted ? LORD Cyril ? Gifted ? CAREY Some of his own things are charming . He 's probably been too shy to show them to you . LORD It 's one of the bitterest disappointments of my life , Mrs. Carey , that he is n't a scholar , following in my steps .

There 's two things I trust I sha n't hear when I get to heaven , that 's " Cheer up , Maria , " and " It 's all for the best .

JULIA It 's evident enough to everyone that you 've dropped Ralph Thurston and  --   --  NANCY And what ? JULIA And begun a very sudden friendship with Tom Hamilton . NANCY Why , I 've never seen Mr. Hamilton until today . JULIA You seem to have accomplished a great deal in a short time . NANCY Ralph Thurston is a dear friend  --  I have n't any more dropped him than  --   --  And as to Mr. Hamilton  --  that 's too absurd to think of . We had something very important to talk about .

GILBERT ( A little sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't tell mother ? JULIA Of course not . GILBERT Well , Nancy and I found an old letter the night we came here . It 's a kind of a will from Tom Hamilton 's grandmother leaving the house to him , so he can take it away from us , if he wants to . JULIA What ? GILBERT Even he does n't know about it himself yet .

Back of table . ) JULIA ( U.R. ) I should think it would be so much more interesting to live abroad . HAMILTON No . Beulah 's about the dearest spot on earth to me tonight . JULIA What an odd point of view ! HAMILTON Do n't you like it here , Miss Carey ? p. 103 JULIA ( Crosses front to C. of table ) Well , there is n't much to interest me , of course . HAMILTON ( Crosses back around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living with this family . And besides , Thurston 's an awfully good chap . JULIA Well , he does n't interest me , either . Of course , the others think he 's quite wonderful ,  --  on  --  Nancy 's account . HAMILTON Oh ! Do they ? JULIA Perhaps I ought n't to have said that  --  but then you 've probably guessed it anyway . He is nice , but not nice enough for Nancy , to my mind . Do n't you think she 's an extremely attractive girl ? HAMILTON Why , yes ,  --  I do . JULIA Of course , she 's been rather petted and that makes her a little capricious in her manner . Sudden in her likes and dislikes , and very impulsive about showing them . HAMILTON ( Crosses to her ) She seems to be worried about something . I feel as if I 've unconsciously offended her . JULIA ( Impulsively ) Perhaps I can understand that ! Mr. Hamilton , I am going to tell you something that I 've just found out  --  something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from you the fact that this house really belongs to you , though your father sold it to them , not knowing his mother 's wishes . p. 104 HAMILTON Belongs to me ? JULIA She found a letter from your grandmother , giving it to you on your twenty-fifth birthday . HAMILTON What ? JULIA Of course , Nancy loves this place better than anything in the world , and you must n't blame her too much if she 's disappointed in losing it . ( RALPH 'S voice heard .

MOTHER , KATHLEEN and PETER . @x TIME : June . Three o'clock in the afternoon . SCENE : The barn of the Yellow House , which has been turned into a hall . It has good dancing floor and a platform L. for music and entertainments . Wide double doors with arch and keystone are at R. A long window is at back , through which can be seen the heavy vines of the crimson rambler in full bloom . One part of the window is unshaded by the roses and can be seen to look through . At L.U. is a platform two feet high , ten by five feet long and wide , sunk in alcove . The ceiling is timbered and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " stained to a dull grayish brown . There is a brown rattan table and two chairs R. , also a piano , stool and chair on platform . A door at L. leads through shed into the house . AT CURTAIN : MRS . CAREY strolls in C. from R. , followed by ANN CHADWICK to R.C. CAREY Come , Cousin Ann . Now you must see the barn . CHADWICK ( R. of table ) You were n't satisfied working yourself to death over the old house , you had to take in the barn , too . CAREY It made such a nice playhouse , we could n't resist it , Cousin Ann . The young people fairly live in it , now that summer has come . Wait till you see the entire village dancing here tonight . ( Crosses U.C. ) Look at that crimson rambler . Is n't it lovely ? p. 108 CHADWICK I must say it looks very different from the day you came , but now that you may have to leave it , you 've probably done it all for nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wool over your eyes . ( Sits R. of table . ) CAREY ( Puts parasol on bench U.C.  --  crosses down back of table  --  laughs ) Thank you . CHADWICK Why on earth have you let a week go by without getting this house question settled ? If I had n't chanced to come here today , heaven knows when you would have got at it . CAREY ( Sits L. of table ) My dear Ann , I 've been perfectly helpless . I found Nancy crying her heart out the night of the house-warming . She told me that after Tom Hamilton knew about his grandmother 's legacy he seemed absolutely changed . CHADWICK What changed him ? CAREY That 's what we do n't know . I wrote to him at once , saying that we would give up the house the moment he wished it . CHADWICK Yes , of course that is what you would say ! CAREY He answered me from Boston , saying that he had no interest whatever in the house and matters might stand as they were . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have written in a different spirit . I ca n't help feeling sorry for Nancy . I could see they were strongly attracted to each other . After all , she was only trying to help . p. 109 CHADWICK She 's young . She 'll get over it . What I ca n't get over is Grandmother Hamilton . That old lady seems to me the most insufferable idiot I ever heard of ! Why could n't the silly woman leave her hifalutin letter in a lawyer 's office and not shut it up in a brick oven without telling her son ? CAREY I ca n't help thinking myself that it was a charming thing to do . CHADWICK ( With scorn ) Charming ! You 've got all kinds of sense but common sense , Margaret . CAREY ( Rises  --  crosses to back of table , taking ribbons from basket , unties them , rolls neatly ) I shall never be any different , Ann . Why do you try to change me ? CHADWICK I do n't know . I suppose because , wrong-headed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CAREY Cousin Ann , a compliment from you ? ( Mischievously ) You would n't let me give you one grateful kiss , I suppose ? CHADWICK ( With rocky resignation ) I do n't know as I mind . If I 've got to be kissed , I 'd rather you 'd do it than anybody . Only I do n't like to be fussed over . ( MRS . CAREY imprints a light kiss on ANN 'S cheek . ANN squirms . MRS . CAREY laughs delightedly . Crosses C. ) I suppose you think I 'm crazy . p. 110 CAREY Whatever you are , you 're a joy , dear . CHADWICK If you do leave this place , all I have to say is , I hope you will go where you can get a rich husband . CAREY ( Quietly ) My husband had enough money to please me , Ann , and when we meet again and I show him his children , he will be the richest man in Paradise . ( Crosses U.C. to window . ) CHADWICK ( Rises  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Margaret ! ( Cross L. ) ( Enter POPHAM and KATHLEEN R.

( Puts letter in pocket . ) CHADWICK If I 'd been here , matters would never have got into this snarl . OSSIAN Well , I ai n't so sure o ' that . CAREY Well , he is n't here yet . Meantime , we must be ready for the dance tonight . Did you bring the wicks for the lanterns , Mr. Popham ? OSSIAN Yes . Right here in my pocket .

OSSIAN ( Sits on window U.C.  --  tries wicks ) She 'd disappoint the hull town if she gives ' em up now . p. 112 CHADWICK I do n't know that it 's necessary to feed and amuse the entire neighborhood . KATHLEEN ( Playing softly ) We can afford to spend more now . Gilbert 's earning lots . OSSIAN Yes , siree ! Four-fifty a week , and Sam Berry says he 's the boss delivery boy o ' this county . CAREY Bless his heart ! It took real pluck for Gilbert to wear overalls . CHADWICK ( L. ) Fiddlesticks ! Is there anything sacred about Gilbert 's legs ? ( Exits L. ) OSSIAN You certainly have waked us up , Mis ' Carey . By ginger , these wicks do n't fit ! ( Gets down . ) I guess I 'll take the lanterns over to Berry 's and get the right size .

OSSIAN ( Waves hand ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) KATHLEEN ( Crosses to mother  --  watches her while she mends white waist ) Mother , do you suppose I 'll ever have anything to wear that is n't mended ? p. 113 CAREY You know mother 's darns do n't show . Do you mind very much , dearest ? KATHLEEN Not when you kiss me . ( MRS . CAREY kisses her . KATHLEEN dances to R. NANCY enters L. with bowl  --  yellow . ) NANCY ( Wears muslin frock with pretty apron nearly covering it ) Trying your steps , Kitty ? ( She crosses back of table .

LORD If he is bent on messing with paint , as his mother did before him , he 'll have to go uninstructed . I do n't believe in it . CAREY If Cyril could go away and study , Beulah would be as proud of him as we are . Look at this picture of my Nancy .

So there 's the Lallie , and there 's the Joy . NANCY I always thought Joy was happiness . LALLIE JOY Joy Line 's the only Joy I ever heard of . NANCY There , now , Mother , does n't she look nice ?

I could go in and stay with the lemonade .  --  Is Gilbert anywhere 's around ? ( Exits L. ) ( JULIA enters L. Wears a quieter dress and apron . Changed demeanor . ) JULIA Aunt Margaret , my cake is in the oven , but I 'm not sure about the dampers . CAREY ( Crossing L. ) Oh , everything depends on those dampers . We must n't lose that tea cake , and I 'll see if Peter is still asleep . ( Exits L. ) JULIA crosses U. to window  --  takes off apron . NANCY crosses R. to table .

JULIA sits on bench C. ) THURSTON Hello , how jolly it looks in here ! Do you know where Osh Popham is ? Tom Hamilton has just arrived at the hotel , and wants to see him . He 's only going to stay over one train . Could I bring him to tea later ? NANCY I 'll ask mother , and find out if she knows where Mr. Popham is . ( Exits L. with bowl . ) THURSTON ( Back of table ) Do n't you think something pretty serious must have happened , Julia ? He did n't even mention Nancy 's name . ( Crosses U. to her . ) I 'm sure they 're fond of each other , and I should like to bring them together . JULIA ( Seated ) That 's generous of you , Ralph . THURSTON Not a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could make it right , I 'd do it , just as you would ,  --  would n't you ? JULIA ( Rises , speaking with feeling ) If you really thing he cares for her , Ralph , contrive to bring him here . I must see him . p. 125 THURSTON You must see him ? JULIA Yes , I must  --  you 'll know why later . I 've made trouble , Ralph , and I 'm going to undo it . THURSTON All right , Julia , I 'll manage it ! NANCY ( Enters L. , having removed her apron ) Mother says Mr. Popham 's at the store , Ralph . THURSTON ( Crosses R. ) Did n't she say anything else ? NANCY No . THURSTON Well , I hope I 'm asked to tea , later . NANCY You have a season ticket , Ralph . ( RALPH exits laughing . NANCY crosses to table R. ) JULIA ( Coming D.C. ) Did n't Aunt Margaret want Tom Hamilton to come to tea ? NANCY ( Sitting L. of table  --  with spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it very clear that this trip is strictly on business . JULIA I 'm not so sure . ( Crosses to her  --  puts hand on NANCY 'S chair back . ) Tell me , Nancy , are you unhappy ? p. 126 NANCY A little . Perhaps he thought I was too friendly on short acquaintance , just as you did . You remember what you said the night of the housewarming ? JULIA ( Crosses L. a bit ) Oh , Nancy , I was angry . I 've done a dreadful thing ! NANCY What do you mean ? JULIA ( Turns  --  with emotion ) All that day I had felt neglected . Nobody admired me . You were first with Cyril , Ralph , and even with Mr. Popham , and I could n't bear it . Then  --  then Tom Hamilton came . I thought at least he would pay me some attention , but it was you again . ( NANCY looks at her . Horribly ashamed ) Oh ! Do n't look at me  --   --  ( Turns away . ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that  --  that you were in love with Ralph Thurston . NANCY How could you , Julia ? How could you ? JULIA ( Turns to her ) Oh , that 's not the worst ! I ca n't remember just what I said  --  but I repeated what Gilbert had told me about the letter leaving him the house . NANCY ( Understanding TOM 'S good-bye ) Gilbert told you , and you told Tom ? I should have been the one to do that ! No wonder he misunderstood . ( Rises and crosses to her . ) Oh , Julia , do you realize what you have done ? p. 127 JULIA Yes , I do now ! And I 'd go down on my knees if it would do any good . NANCY ( Stops her ) Do n't cry , Julia , do n't ! I 'm so glad you told me . Now perhaps I understand , and can make things right again . JULIA I do n't expect forgiveness . I do n't deserve it . THURSTON ( Outside ) You have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't . THURSTON Come along in ! NANCY ( Looking at JULIA  --  runs L. ) It 's Tom ! Coming here ? JULIA Yes , I asked him to come .

I understand that Mrs. Carey wishes to see me . JULIA No , I do . ( RALPH exits quietly with a look or sign to JULIA . ) Mr. Hamilton . ( Pause . ) Mr. Hamilton , there is something I must tell you . The night you were here I felt unhappy and neglected , and I let you think something that was n't true about Nancy and Ralph  --   --  You remember ? p. 128 NANCY Do n't , Julia , I ca n't bear it ! JULIA As to the house , I had no right to forestall Nancy in telling you about it . I do n't know why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to undo the harm I 've done . You see  --  the Old Beast is slipping away from me , now , Mr. Hamilton . HAMILTON ( Goes to her  --  holds out hand ) I understand . Let us never think of it again , Miss Julia . ( JULIA takes his hand . ) NANCY ( L. Crosses up to JULIA and puts arm around her ) No . We 've dived under the Ice Pack and scaled Shiny Wall , now , Judy . JULIA ( Crosses D.L. , turns ) It was a hard climb , Nancy , but  --  I am glad I made it . ( NANCY and JULIA kiss each other . JULIA exits with a sob . ) NANCY ( After a pause , looking after JULIA ) That was brave of her . I believe she is going to belong to the family , after all . I 'm so glad it was nothing I did that made you act so strangely when you found your grandmother 's letter . HAMILTON I 've never seen any letter . p. 129 NANCY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture . HAMILTON I found no letter with the picture . NANCY Then where is it ? You did n't think I  --   --  HAMILTON No , no ! I did n't stop to think . When your cousin told me about Thurston , I  --  I was jealous . ( NANCY looks conscious . ) Oh , what a fool I was ! Forgive me , Nancy . Never mind the letter , never mind the house  --   --  NANCY But we must mind it . I arranged it with my own hands , and Gilbert put it in the oven . ( Crosses L. ) HAMILTON That 's the strangest thing I ever heard of . NANCY Mother  --  Mr. Popham  --  Julia  --  everybody  --  comein here ! Quick ! ( Crosses R. , then C. ) OSSIAN ( Enters , followed by RALPH ) What 's up ? House or barn afire ? ( MRS . CAREY , JULIA and GILBERT enter L. ) NANCY Oh , Mother ! Grandmother Hamilton 's letter 's gone ! ALL ( Except JULIA ) Gone ? p. 130 NANCY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter was n't with it . ( JULIA starts  --  crosses U.C. ) OSSIAN ( R. ) It slipped back , then . It 's still in that darned brick oven . A brick oven 's intended for beans and brown bread . It had n't ought to be used for a post-office . ( RALPH is back of table . ) NANCY Gilly , did n't you put the package back in the oven ? GILBERT I certainly did . The paper was blue and was tied around the picture with ribbon . ( TOM shows that his memory is stirring when the blue paper is mentioned . ) OSSIAN Well  --  if that 's the case , someone else monkeyed with it  --  afore Tom got at it . JULIA ( Steps down from back ) I did ! At least I touched it , but nothing more . ALL You ! JULIA Gilbert told me about it and I wanted to see what it was like  --  but as I was unwrapping it I heard Mr. Hamilton coming , and I put the picture back because I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter . p. 131 OSSIAN What became of the paper , Julia ? JULIA I do n't know . I left the room . THURSTON And I went out with her . HAMILTON Why , it seems to me I saw that blue paper on the floor and I  --   --  ALL What did you do with it ? HAMILTON ( Pause ) I picked it up  --  and threw it in the fire . ( Pause . Everyone laughs in nervous relief . ) OSSIAN That 's a nice thing to do with a paper givin ' you a house an ' lot . ( MRS . CAREY crosses to him . JULIA crosses to NANCY . GILBERT up to piano stool . ) CAREY To think you should have done it . OSSIAN ( Delighted ) The onlikeliest villain o ' the whole bunch . ( Punches TOM in the back . ) Land , I hope that Old Lady Hamilton knows we 've got it straight . HAMILTON Well , if the house is mine , I suppose I may choose my tenants ? OSSIAN That 's accordin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very good , then . ( Bows to MRS . CAREY . ) Madame , your most obedient landlord ! CAREY Thank you , Tom ! ( General laughter and relief . NANCY makes a secret , impulsive gesture of wanting to " hug " TOM , but nips it in its bud , turns and hugs POPHAM instead . Noisy ad lib. from all . ) CHADWICK ( Entering L. with teapot ) It sounds as if you were having a camp meeting out here . Do you intend to have tea ? This has been boiling for the last ten minutes . CAREY I 'm sure we need it . Come along , everybody . ( General exit R. TOM and ANN stay on stage . ) OSSIAN I 'm gettin ' so I like a little smack myself this time o ' day .

I do n't know whether I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may be permitted to say so , I hope with all my heart you will be . ( Crosses R. a bit . ) CHADWICK Well , I 've got something to say to you . THURSTON ( Running on from R. ) See here , if we 're going to have anything to eat  --  ( Takes teapot from TOM )  --  I think I better take that tea ! ( Exits R. ) CHADWICK ( Crosses to TOM ) See here , young man , when I want anything , I say so without shilly-shallying . If this house is for sale , I 'll buy it . Might as well do that as leave the money to the family when I 'm dead . HAMILTON ( Laughing ) I 'm not so sure that it is for sale . CHADWICK What does a young whipper-snapper like you want with a house ? HAMILTON Well , I might marry . ( Looks off R. ) CHADWICK No more likely to marry now than you were an hour ago , are you ? HAMILTON I rather  --  hope so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something in confidence ? ( He makes a movement to speak. ) p. 134 CHADWICK Yes , make it short . HAMILTON If I could marry Nancy Carey I 'd be the happiest man in the world . CHADWICK Umph ! It does n't worry you that you have n't seen her more than three or four times all told . HAMILTON Not a bit . We were friends from the first . Besides , I know her mother . Have you heard the old proverb : " Thy mother is like a vine in the blood ? " CHADWICK I do n't know anything about vines or blood , but I can see that you have a gleam of common sense , so  --   --  ( Surprised and pleased . ) Go ahead and get her if you can . As you say , she 's her mother 's daughter . ( Crosses him R. ) HAMILTON If I do n't succeed the house is yours . CHADWICK Well , I wo n't be kept dangling . I tell you that . Can you let me know in twenty-four hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to work , then ! The only man I ever thought of marrying was so long in coming to the point , I refused him before he asked me . HAMILTON I hope that wo n't happen to me . ( NANCY enters with tea-tray  --  crosses to table. ) p. 135 CHADWICK Make hay , young man . ( Exits R. ) HAMILTON ( As she goes ) Do n't worry . NANCY Here 's your tea , Mr. Hamilton . ( Puts tray on table . TOM crosses to L. of her . ) Will you have lemon or cream ? HAMILTON Both ! I 'm so ridiculously happy I do n't care what I have . ( Recklessly ) Put in six lumps , half a lemon and a jug of cream . ( Changed voice ) I 'd drink anything that was poured by that lovely little hand of yours . Nancy , do n't look at the sugarbowl , look at me . Do things seem different to you , too ? NANCY Yes , it 's a different world from yesterday 's , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suspicious and  --  and  --  went away without saying good-bye . I do n't know why I am forgiving you . HAMILTON Nor I. But you are , are n't you ? ( He tries to put his hand over NANCY 'S , but she removes it . ) NANCY ( Crosses L. ) I suppose so . HAMILTON I know you are ! That 's why today 's world is different . Why , it seems all sunshine and roses  --   --  ( Takes rose from wallet.You see , I still have the little faded flower . p. 136 NANCY Yes , it 's the crimson rambler that I planted . ( Turns U.C. ) How it 's grown . HAMILTON ( Turns U.C. Replacing rose ) And how it 's blooming . ( Coming nearer.Do you think I 'm worthy of another rose in exchange ? NANCY Help yourself . HAMILTON ( Not moving ) I shall like it better if you pick it . NANCY Are you afraid of thorns ? HAMILTON What do you think ? NANCY I think  --  not ! ( Crosses to window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crosses to her ) The topmost one up there in the corner . NANCY You are ambitious for the highest , are n't you ? ( Steps on bench  --  TOM helps her . ) HAMILTON I am . NANCY ( Reaching up and taking hold of a rose ) Come along , little rose . You have to bend down to a man . ( Looking at TOM ) Do you think you deserve it ? p. 137 HAMILTON No , I do n't . But oh , how I want it . Just this one rose in all the world . Let me work for it , and take care of it all my life . NANCY ( Understanding ) Oh ! HAMILTON Will you take the Yellow House and me ? We 're both yours if you only say yes . NANCY You asked for the rose . I 'll give you that first .

CAREY She brings you nothing , Tom . HAMILTON Nothing but herself . CAREY ( To NANCY ) Are you happy , dear , and certain ? NANCY Happy and certain !
