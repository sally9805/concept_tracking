txt " The question which , at the present moment , most deeply concerns the prosperity and business methods of the country is this , viz. : What is the economic mind of the Supreme Court of the United States ? ' " This statement , audacious as it will seem to many , striking and pregnant as It it must seem to all who have stud ; 1 ied the situation , was made by " WILLIAM M. IviNs of this city last week before the Georgia Bar Association . It was based on a searching analysis of the ! ? various  --  and varying  --  decisions and /a opinions of the Supreme Court in cases ; ? arising under the Sherman Anti-Trust i1 act of 1890 . These decisions and opin:7 ions , the decisions embodying the corn , mon law , in this country and in England , and much of the legislation of this country , England , and , incidental- ? ? ly , Germany and France , are exam- , 1 ? , fined by Mr. Ivzss in the light of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cepted in the past and in the light of , ' ' those by which the earlier have been , in his judgment , overturned and replaced . The statement is elaborate , , logically presented , and vividly illus-1 l ? trated . The argument is strongly and brilliantly made ; the conclu-ions are soberly but most courageously applied . The whole address is a vigorous and somewhat defiant defense of practical : . ly complete freedom of contract , or , 1 , rather , it is a ringing warning that neither legislatures nor courts can really suppress such freedom , or , without great harm , endeavor to sup- ! ? press it or interfere with it . The ern : phatic question we have quoted is suggested by the history of the action of e ? the Supreme Court with reference to e freedom of contract as affected , or as held to be affected , by the Anti-Trust act . In the course of that action the court has come to a point where neither ' the unavoidable meaning of the language of the law nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in the law can be said to have determined its decisions . It has reached a point where its decisions are closely connected with , are influenced and even shaped by , the views of the majority as to economic theory , and where , in an essential degree , the differences between the majority and minority  --  in most cases one vote would have changed one into the other  --  have openly turned upon their views of economic theory . And thus , the " economic mind " of the court acquires the tremendous importance that ' Mr. Ivixs implies . The key to this momentous process lies in the words " trade " and " competition . " The law of 1S90 condemns every " contract , combination . or conspiracy in restraint of trade . " The court has gradually come to pronounce restraint of competition to be equivalent to restraint of trade . It has condemned combinations which did not restrain trade on the ground that they did restrain competition . It has gone further and condemned those intended to restrain competition , whether the intent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has inferred intention to - restrain competition from the fact that such restraint became possible . The ? economic theory by which the court has most been influenced is that competition is essentially good , is , in the old phrase , " the life of trade , " and , there ' fore , that all restraint of it or opportunity for restraint of it , is bad . This theory is adopted as that of the law , and hence is to be applied ; but the words of the law do not necessarily involve that theory . The Judges have chosen to apply the theory , moved thereto largely by the strong sentiment in its favor in the public mind . Had they refrained from doing so the history of business in the United States for the ? last twenty years would have been very different . Whether they continue to apply it in the cases pending  --  the Standard Oil and Tobacco cases  --  will have much to do with their decision . Thus the " economic mind of the Supreme Court " becomes of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economists , that unrestrained competition is not good , but bad , and that the restraints put upon competition by combinations of capital , energy , skill , and organization are not bad , but good . ' He holds that such combinations and - such restraints are the logical , inevitable , and beneficent result of freedom of contract , and that freedom of con7-actual , and ought to be tile recognized legal , basis of all the business of our own country and of the world . In the long run the efforts of lawmakers or of courts interpreting the law , to limit and repress freedom of contract he believes will be futile . Enumerating the things ' of importance and value which the State can do , he declares : " It can not control the aggregations of ' capital any more than it can the winds ; nor can it control the currents that go to determine price or to make markets any more than it can the tides ; nor can it determine the result of the freedom of contract any more than it can say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' this context Mr. Ivngs makes an acute analysis of the modern doctrine of price anAlralue as the outcome ; the resultant of the manifold forces of need and desire that determine exchange ; a resultant which will issue most satisfactorily under conditions of the greatest possible freedom of contract . He also reviews succinctly the development of the secular contest between such freedom , on the one hand , and on the other the effort to impose " just " prices by the authority and the power of the State . It would have been interesting in connection with this review had he examined the status and future of corporations , the artificial persons created by the State . endowed with the possibility of perpetual continuation with exemption of members from the complete liability enforced as to individuals , and possessing , in a most important class , the use of the sovereign power of eminent domain . Such an examination would have made still more valuable his bold treatment of a subject as to which , in his own words , " the opinion of the competent has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
