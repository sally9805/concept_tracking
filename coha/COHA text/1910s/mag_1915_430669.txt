 |p517  BECAUSE the question is widely discussed whether peace throughout the world may be attained by the friendly cooperation of many nations , and because a nation 's attitude towards this question may determine her future prosperity or ruin , it may be well to note what has been the trend of the nations hitherto , and whether any forces exist that may reasonably be expected to change that trend . We may then be able to induce from facts the law which that trend obeys , and make a reasonable deduction as to whether or not the world is moving towards peace . If we do this we shall follow the inductive method of modern science , and avoid the error ( with its perilous results ) of first assuming the law and then deducing conclusions from it . Men have always been divided into organizations , the first organization being the family . As time went on families were formed into tribes , for self-protection . The underlying cause for the organization was always a desire for strength ; sometimes for defense , sometimes for offense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alliance with other tribes to attain a common end , the alliance being brought about by peaceful agreement , and usually ceasing after the end had been attained , or missed , or when tribal jealousies forbade further common effort . Sometimes tribes joined to form one larger tribe ; the union being either forced on a weaker by a stronger tribe , or caused by a desire to secure a strength greater and more lasting than mere alliance can ensure . In the same way , and apparently according to similar laws , sovereign states or nations were formed from tribes ; and in later years , by the union of separate states . The states or nations have become larger and larger as time has  |p518  gone on ; greater numbers , not only of people but of peoples , living in the same general localities and having hereditary ties , joining to form a nation . Though the forms of government of these states or nations are numerous , and though the conceptions of people as to the purposes and functions of the State vary greatly , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among all the states and nations of the world , the existence of an armed military force , placed under the control of its Government ; the purpose of this armed force being to enable the Government not only to carry on its administration of internal matters , but also to exert itself externally against the armed force of another state . This armed force has been a prominent factor in the life of every sovereign state and independent tribe , from history 's beginning , and is no less a factor now . No instance can be found of a sovereign state without its appropriate armed force , to guard its sovereignty , and preserve that freedom from external control , without which freedom it ceases to exist as a sovereign state . The armed force has always been a matter of very great expense . It has always required the anxious care of the Government and the people . The men comprising it have always been subjected to restraint and discipline , compelled to undergo hardships and dangers greater than those of civil life , and developed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every state has had not only continuous existence always , but continuous , potential readiness , if not continuous employment ; and the greatest changes in the mutual relations of nations have been brought about by the victory of the armed force of one state over the armed force of another state . This does not mean that the fundamental causes of the changes have been physical , for they have been psychological , and have been so profound and so complex as to defy analysis ; but it does mean that the actual and immediate instrument producing the changes has been physical force ; that physical force and physical courage acting in conjunction , of which conjunction war is the ultimate expression , have always been the most potent instruments in the dealings of nations with each other . Is there any change towards peaceful methods now ? No , on the contrary ; war is recognized as the most potent  |p519  method still ; the prominence of military matters is greater than ever before ; at no time in the past has interest in war been so keen as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money been so prodigal ; at no time before has war so thoroughly engaged the intellect and energy of mankind . In other words the trend of the nations has been towards a clearer recognition of the efficacy of military power , and an increasing use of the instrumentality of war . The cause of this trend , ? this clean-cut , uniform trend in all nations and in all times ? is easily found in the simple fact that physical force can exert a greater influence on a person , or a nation , than any other force can ; because it threatens life itself and arouses the primary instinct of selfpreservation , " the first law of nature . " For while it is true that human beings can be influenced by other forces , usually called " moral " forces , such as love , hate , ambition , gratitude , conscience , and so forth ; and , that these moral forces profoundly influence human effort , and although it is sometimes asserted that they are more powerful than physical force , and even that the courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage needed to oppose a physical force , ? yet nevertheless , the force that has actually decided the issue in every great crisis among nations has been actual physical force with its threat against life itself ; and the courage that has been the most important has been " physical courage , " the virtus of the Romans , without which no man could ever have stood up against that threat . At the present day , as in the past , it is recognized that life is a man 's most valuable possession , and that consequently the most effective force to bring to bear upon a man is a threat against his life . It is for this reason that the State threatens death for murder , while to discourage lesser crimes than murder , threats of forcible imprisonment or corporal punishment are employed ; the experience of men having shown abundantly that the threat of physical force , ? not moral , mental or spiritual force , not argument or persuasion , ? has been the most effective and is the most effective still . This may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flattering one . But experience shows the danger of believing flattery ? and common sense tells us that it is as dangerous for nations to believe flattery as for individuals . The demagogue flatters the crowd , and naturally the crowd like the  |p520  demagogue . But crowds are swayed by emotion not by reason ; and if we wish to read history with clear judgment and common sense , in order to see what light the past can give us , we must admit this frankly . We must not flatter ourselves , or let others flatter us ; and we must be open-minded enough to accept history 's data as to the real nature of man , and especially of " crowds " of men , and their actual conduct in the past . This brief consideration of the trend of people up to the present time seems to show that , due to the nature of man himself , especially to the nature of large " crowds " of men , the direction in which nations have been moving hitherto has not been towards securing the blessings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and areas of war . This being the case , what forces exist that may reasonably be expected to change that trend ? Three main forces are usually mentioned : Civilization , Commerce , Christianity . Before considering these it may be well to note Newton 's first law of motion , that every body will continue in a state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line , unless acted on by some external force ; for though this law was affirmed of material bodies , yet its applicability to large groups of men is striking and suggestive . For not only do human beings have the physical attributes of weight and inertia like other material bodies , but their mental organism , while of a higher order than the physical , is as powerfully affected by external forces . And though it is true that psychology has not yet secured her Sir Isaac Newton , and that no one has yet formulated a law that expresses exactly the action of the minds and spirits of men under the influence of certain mental and moral stimuli or forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influenced by fear , hope , ambition , hate , and so forth , in ways that are fairly well understood , and toward results that often can be predicted in advance . Our whole theory of government and our laws of business and everyday life are founded on the belief that men are the same to-day as they were yesterday and that they will be the same to-morrow . The whole science of psychology is based on the observed and recorded actions of the human organism under the influence of certain external stimuli or forces , and starts from the assumption that this  |p521  organism has definite and permanent characteristics . If this is not so ? if the behavior of men in the past has not been governed by actual laws which will also govern their behavior in the future ; then our laws of government are built on error , and the teachings of psychology are foolish . This does not mean that any man will necessarily act in the same way to-morrow as he did yesterday , when subjected to the influence of the same threat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of free will , we realize that a man 's action is never the result of only one stimulus and motive , but is the resultant of many ; and we have , no reason to expect that he will act in the same way when subjected to the same stimulus , unless we know that the internal and external conditions pertaining to him are also the same . Furthermore , even if we can not predict what a certain individual will do , when exposed to a certain external influence , because of some differences in his mental and physical condition , on one occasion in comparison with another , yet when we consider large groups of men , we know that individual peculiarities , permanent and temporary , balance each other in great measure ; that the average condition of a group of men is less changeable than that of one man , and that the degree of permanency of condition increases with the number of men in the group . From this we may reasonably conclude that , if we know the character of a man ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the line of action which he ? or they ? have followed in the past , we shall be able to predict his ? or their ? line of action in the future with considerable accuracy ; and that the accuracy will increase with the number of men in the group , and the length of time during which they have followed the known line of action . Le Bon says : " Every race carries in its mental constitution the laws of its destiny . " Therefore , the line of action that the entire human race has followed during the centuries of the past is a good index ? or at least the best index that we have ? to its line of action during the centuries of the future . Now men have been on this earth for many years ; and history and psychology teach us that in their intercourse with each other , their conduct has been caused by a combination of many forces , among which are certain powerful forces that tend to create strife . The strongest by far of these forces is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implanted which makes a man in a measure self-protecting . This ego prompts a man not only to seek pleasure and avoid trouble for himself , but also to gain superiority , and , if possible , the mastery over his fellow men . Men being placed in life in close juxtaposition to each other , the struggles of each man to advance his own interests produce rivalries , jealousies , and conflicts . Similarly with nations . Nations have been composed for the most part of people having an heredity more or less common to them all , so that they are bound together as great clans . From this it has resulted that nations have been jealous of each other and have combatted each other . They have been doing this since history began , and are doing it as much as ever now . In fact , mankind have been in existence for so many centuries , and their physical , moral , mental and spiritual characteristics were so evidently implanted in them by the Almighty , that it seems difficult to see how anyone , except the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct . It is a common saying that a man can not lift himself over the fence by his bootstraps , though he can jump over the fence , if it is not too high . This saying recognizes the fact that " a material system can do no work on itself " ; but needs external aid . When a man pulls upwards on his bootstraps , the upward force that he exerts is exactly balanced by the downward reaction exerted by his bootstraps ; but when he jumps , the downward thrust of his legs causes an equal reaction of the earth , which exerts a direct force upward upon the man ; and it is this external force that moves him over the fence . It is this external force , the reaction of the earth or air or water , which moves every animal that walks , or bird that flies , or fish that swims . It is the will of the Almighty , acting through the various stimuli of nature , that causes the desire to walk , and all the emotions and actions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act on men , their line of conduct will surely change . But if He does not , ? how can it change , or be changed ; how can the human race turn about , by means of its own power only , and move in a direction the reverse from that in which it has been moving throughout all the centuries of the past ? These considerations seem to indicate that nations , regarded in their relation towards each other , will go on in  |p523  the direction in which they have been going unless acted upon by some external force . Will civilization , commerce or Christianity impart that force ? Inasmuch as civilization is merely a condition in which men live , and an expression of their history , character and aims , it is difficult to see how it could of itself act as an external force , or cause an external force to act . " Institutions and laws are the outward manifestation of our character , the expression of its needs . Being its outcome , institutions and laws can not change this character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization of some given nation may have been brought about in some degree by forces external to that nation , yet it is clear that we must regard that civilization rather as the result of those forces than as a force itself . Besides , civilization has never yet made the relations of nations with each other more unselfish ; civilized nations now and in the past , despite their veneer of courtesy , being fully as jealous of each other as the most savage tribes , That this should be so seems natural ; because civilization has resulted mainly from the attempts of individuals and groups to enhance the pleasures and diminish the ills of life , and therefore can not tend to unselfishness in either individuals or nations . Civilization in the past has not operated to soften the relations of nations with each other , so why should it do so now ? Is not modern civilization , with its attendant complexities , rivalries and jealousies , provocative of quarrels rather than the reverse ? In what respect is modern civilization better than past civilization , except in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Are we any more artistic , strong or beautiful than the Grecians in their palmy days ? Are we braver than the Spartans , more honest than the Chinamen , more spiritual than the Hindoos , more religious than the Puritans ! Is not the civilization of the present day a mechanical civilization pure and simple ! And has not the invention of electrical and mechanical appliances , with the resulting ensuring of communication and transportation , and the improvements in instruments of destruction , advantaged the great nations more than the weaker ones , and increased the temptation to great nations to use force rather than decreased it ? Do not civilization 's im-  |p524  provements in weapons of destruction augment the effectiveness of warlike methods , as compared with the peaceful methods of argument and persuasion ? Diplomacy is an agency of civilization , that was invented to avoid war , to enable nations to accommodate themselves to each other without going to war ; but , practically , diplomacy seems to have caused almost as many wars as it has averted . And even if it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main for peace rather than for war , we know that diplomacy has been in use for centuries , that its resources are well understood , and that they have all been tried out many times ; and therefore we ought to realize clearly that diplomacy can not introduce any new force into international politics now , or exert an influence for peace that will be more potent in the future than the influence that it has exerted in the past . These considerations seem to show that we can not reasonably expect civilization to divert nations from the path they have followed hitherto . Can commerce impart the external force necessary to divert nations from that path ? Since commerce bears exactly the same relation to nations now as in times past , and since it is an agency within mankind itself , it is difficult to see how it can act as an external force , or cause an external force to be applied . Of course , commercial interests are often opposed to national interests , and improvements in speed and sureness of communication and transportation increase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors increase the power of governments and the solidarity of nations . At no time in the past has there been more national feeling in nations than now . Even the loosely held provinces of China are forming a Chinese nation . Despite the fundamental commercialism of the age , national spirit is growing more intense , the present war being the main intensifying cause . It is true that the interests of commerce are in many ways antagonistic to those of war . But , on the other hand , of all the causes that occasion war the economic causes are the greatest . For no thing will men fight more savagely than for money ; for no thing have men fought more savagely than for money ; and the greater the rivalry , the more the man 's life becomes devoted to it , and the more fiercely he will fight to get or keep it . Surely of all the means  |p525  by which we hope to avoid war , the most hopeless by far is commerce . The greatest of all hopes is in Christianity , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence on the individual in cultivating unselfishness and other peaceful virtues , and the fact that it is an inspiration from On High , and therefore a force external to mankind . But let us look the facts solemnly in the face that the Christian religion has now been in effect for nearly two thousand years ; that the nations now warring are Christian nations , in the very foremost rank of Christendom ; that never in history has there been so much bloodshed in such widespread areas and so much hate , and that we see no signs that Christianity is employing any influence that she has not been employing for nearly two thousand years . If we loot for the influence of Christianity , we can find it in the daily lives of people , in the family , in business , in politics and in military bodies ; everywhere , in fact , in Christian countries , so long as we keep inside of any organization the members of which feel bound together . This we must all admit , even the heathen know it ; but where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christianity in the dealings of one organization with another with which it has no special bonds of friendship ? Christianity is invoked in every warring nation now , to stimulate the patriotic spirit of the nation , and intensify the hate of the crowd against the enemy ; and even if we think that such invoking is a perversion of religious influence to unrighteous ends , we must admit the fact that the Christian religion itself is at this moment being made to exert a powerful influence ? not towards peace but towards war ! And this should not amaze us ; for where does the Bible say or intimate that love among nations will ever be brought about ? The Saviour said : " I bring not peace but a sword . " So what reasonable hope does even Christianity give us that war between nations will cease ? And even if it did give reasonable hope , let us realize that between reasonable hope and reasonable expectation there is a great gulf fixed . Therefore , we seem forced to the conclusion that the world will move in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that nations will become larger and larger and fewer and fewer , the immediate instrument of international changes being war ; and that certain nations will become  |p526  very powerful and nearly dominate the earth in turn , as Persia , Greece , Rome and Great Britain have done , ? and as some other country may do . Fortunately , or perhaps unfortunately , a certain law of decadence seems to have prevailed , because of which every nation , after acquiring great power , has in turn succumbed to the enervating effects which seem inseparable from it , and become the victim of some newer nation , that has made strenuous preparations for long years , in secret , and finally pounced upon her as a lion on its prey . Were it not for this tendency to decadence , we should expect that the nations of the earth would ultimately be divided into two great nations , and that these would contend for the mastery in a world-wide struggle . But if the present rate of invention and development continues , improvements in the mechanic arts will probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the swiftness and sureness of transportation and communication , that some monster of efficiency will have time to acquire world mastery before her period of decadence sets in . In this event , wars will be of a magnitude besides which the present struggle will seem pygmy ; and will rage over the surface of the earth , for the gaining and retaining of the mastery of the world .
