txt WASHINGTON , July ** Borah of Idaho , a leader of the advanced wing of the Republicans , came to the defense of the principle involved in the Democratic income tax provision of the Tariff bill late t his afternoon with a carefully prepared speech . Mr. Borah had worked hard for several years for a Constitutional amendment authorizing a Federal levy on incomes , and his speech to-day was only mildly in criticism of the use the Democrats had made of that authorization . To his mind , the bill as it came from the House was better than the Senate amendment in that the point of exemption was higher . Tie argued that it was unfair in this country , where the bulk of taxation is indirect and falls disproportional ely upon the poor consumer , to say that a high line of exemption in the income tax was too great a discrimination against the rich . If all taxes in this country were direct . he said , he would favor lowering the exemption limit to $900. so that every man would pay tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high exemption merely makes a slight concession to the ordinary consumer , already overburdened with tax , ation . Mr. Borah quoted the estimates of the revenues expected from the pending Tariff bill to show that the income tax is planned to produce only one-eighth of the revenues of the country . The other seven-eights of revenue , he said , is to be produced by indirect taxation that falls chiefly on poor men . He estimated that the man of small income pays in indirect taxes from 10 to 20 per cent . of his earnings , so that the exemption granted to hint in the income tax is really inconsiderable . Mr. Borah 's speech , the first on the income tax in the present debate , followed the conclusion of an address by Senator Smoot , who for two days had analyzed the duties of the SimmonsUnderwood bill . Senator Borah 's address , to be continued to-morrow , held the close attention of Senators throughout the hour he had the floor . He urged that the $3,000 exemption fixed by the Senate Committee be raised to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Additional Burden . " " Under this income tax provision there will be no relief for those who ought to have relief , " said the Senator . " It will be a new source of revenue , but the old sources , the indirect tariff and ternal revenue taxes , will still be worked to the limit . Until there is a reduction in the revenue from these other sources , this would simply be an additional burden . It will be simply another means of securing revenue to gratify our scandalous desire to spend money . " Less than 3 per cent of the American people ha ye Incomes above $ 4 , e et ' . Senator Borah said . The income tax burden should fall upon these wealthier cdizens , he declared , rather than upon the poorer man already paying a heavy tax through tariff and internal revenue channels . Senator Bristow interrupted to urge that the graduated tax be increased more heavily on the larger incomes . He suggested a tax as high as 10 per cent . on incomes of 5. , 1u0,000 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " agreed Senator Borah , " when we can levy the expenditures and extravagances of the country upon the property of the nation . These vast fortunes have got to take care of the expenditures . " Concluding his two-day , speech , Senator Smoot devoted considerable attention to the pottery tariffs which he maintained were far too low . He declared that the transportation question was a great problem , and that there were crockery rates to Salt Lake City tram England that were lower than the rate front Ohio . This brought Senator Cummins to his feet to refer to a bill introduced by him which would prohibit railroads and other carriers from fixing proportional rates on combined foreign and domestic hauls lower than domestic rates . " Domestic producers . " said Senator Cummins. " are in many instances denied adequate protection , and are compelled to pay from one-third to one-half more than their foreign rivals for transportation over their own railoads . Such a condition is absolutely indefensible . To remedy this will need a legislative enactment , which I intend to press with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Smoot discussed the agricultural schedule at length , saying in part : Instead of making meats dutiable , the bill now adds livestock to the free list . With meats free , it will help concentrate the control of those products in the hands of what are known as the beef barons and well help kill off small dealers and throttle competition . The expense of feeding and the shrinkage of carcass are eliminated in transporting beef , hence a large corporation with facilities for importing dressed beef can save a good deal in labor , feeding , and so forth . When no duty is imposed it will be a discrimination against the farmer and others raising livestock in this country . But if meat is to he admitted free , it is better that the deception should be done away with and livestock also allowed to come In free . Eighty-five per cent . of the corn raised in this country is turd for livestock . The importation of meats and live cattle will give a tremendous advantage to Canada . Mexico . Argentina . and other such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will strengthen the grip of the large packer and will not in any probability reduce the cost of meats a particle to the consumer . Senate Democrats declared to-day that few set tariff speches would come from their side of the chamber . " We are not going to take up time debating this bill , ' said Chairman  --  Simmons . " If the bill proves not to be for the benefit of the country , it will demonstrate that our ideas of the tariff are wrong ; if it proves to be well for the country , it will demonstrate that the opposition is wrong . That is all there is to this proposition . and we are ready and anxious now to pass the bill . It is going to pass . "
