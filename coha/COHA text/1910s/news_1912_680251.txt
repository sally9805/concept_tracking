txt It was a very earnest and moving appeal that Senator Roor made to the Chamber of Commerce on Thursday evening . He is , as we all know , not a man much given to warmth of expression , but in this instance his expressions were serious , deliberate , careful , and exceedingly warm . They were the outcome of long study and intimate experience with public affairs of the deepest importance . In every department of public life with which Mr. ROOT has had to deal he has brought to his task the habit of exhaustive Inquiry proper to his profession , the sober consideration , and the searching judgment that success in the law requires . And in all larger matters he has also brought the lawyer 's fidelity to his client , which has been all the stronger and more fruitful because his client has been the American people . Happily for him , and still more happily for us , the Senator has devoted especial study to the department of foreign affairs . When he speaks on this sub:feet ho speaks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scribes may be , but as one having authority . On Thursday evening he spoke with extreme seriousness on the obligations that are binding on the Nation in the matter of the Panama CanaL He recited the language of the treaties by our signatures to which we had assumed these obligations . He recounted the action of Congress which is regarded by the other party to the treaties as a violation of these treaties , a view which the Senator shares . What is to be done in the premises ? His answer was prompt , definite , and con-clusive : We have a treaty with Great Britain under which we have agreed that all questions arising upon the interpretation of treaties shall be submitted to arbitration , and it seems hardly conceivable , then , are men tam say that we will never arbitrate the question of the construction of that treaty . And I say to you that if we icfuee to arbitrate it biall be in the position of the merchant - who is known to all the world to is- , false to his promises . With our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world of commerce as a merchant false to his word . Among all the people on this earth who hope for better days of righteousness and peace in the future we shall stand in the light of our multitude of declarations for arbitration and Peace , discredited , dishonored , hypocrites , with the fair name of America blackened , with the self-respect of Americans gone , with the influence of America for advance along the pathway of progress and civilization annulled , dishonored , and disgraced . Senator Roor had pointed out at the beginning of his speech that the only question of fundamental importance involved in the National election through which we had just passed was not the tariff , or the trusts , but the question Of the capacity of the great American democracy for self-government . Here , on the morrow of the election , the test is to be met . We have by the action of our Government , in exempting our coastwise trading vessels from canal tolls , raised an issue of honor with tilt . nation to which we are most closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not of capital Importance . The advantage which is expected from it at most must be insignificant . It would have been far more sensible for our Government to forego it . The action was not demanded by public opinion . It was not even understood hype mass of the people , Had It been understood , We. * : convinced that the majority of the voters would have , : been opposed to it . But it was taken , and it has been challenged under a treaty which we sought and which is in accordance with a long line of precedents embodying the policy and the moral sentiment of the American Nation . That treaty requires that we shall submit the issue we have raised to arbitration . Unless the matter is settled , as it may be , by the repeal of the contested legislation , it ought in all decency to be arbitrated . Whether it will be or not will depend on the course of public opinion . Left to themselves , the representatives of the Nation will hardly retrace their steps or submit the issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nation be just  --  and , as Senator ROOT declares , to be able to do justiee , 1 as . a Nation is of the essence ) of -selfgovernment:7413e matter will be closed easily and naturally - If not , ; . the N 00# ' **26;775;TOOLONG -W ; g105z7.7. , " will be in the position or the met : : : " chant who le known to all the world " to be false to his promises .
