txt " Any peace worth having can not be found in a cessation of active hostilities , followed by a process of territorial bargaining to be embodied in protocols and pacts , and still less in an arrangement imposed by victors or vanquished which sets at defiance the historic traditions , aspirations , and liberties of the peoples affected . " Ex-Premier Herbert H. Asquith , who has recently returned from a visit to the western front , made this statement in addressing a mass meeting at Leeds tonight under the auspices of the War Alms Committee . He described the German reply to the Papal note as teeming with " nebulous and unctuous generalities , " but giving no indication that Germany would take any practical steps to open " the road to a real and lasting peace . " Is there any reason to think that Germany has learned the lessen of the inevitable consequences of international spoliation ? " asked Mr. Asquith . " 14 there in the Chancellor 's dispatch or in any recent authoritative declaration of the German Government any indication that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 71 , but to take any practical steps which alone can open the road to a real and lasting peace ? " Is Germany ready to restore what she then took from France ? Is she ready to give Belgium complete independence . political and economic ; without fetters or reservations , and with as Complete an indemnity as any merely material compensation can provide for the devastation of her territory , the sufferings of her people ? A definite r.:ply to these questions would be worth a whole column of pious platitudes . " Proof in Bucharest Disclosures . Alluding to the necessity of destroying Prussian militarism , Mr. Asquith referred to the American revelations of the German machinations in Bucharest as fresh proof of the brutality and callousness with which Germany had waged war . He said that nothing had aroused snore world-wide surprise and consternation than the fact that the German nation applauded With fervor the most barbarous transgressions of the German Government . " It shows from what unmeasured perils , from what a setback to the whole machinery of civilization mankind has ? been delivered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German hegemony . " said Mr , Asquith . Passing to the subject of war aims , he said : " We are fighting for two aims , one immediate , the other ulterior . The first is , not the restoration of the status quo , not a revival of what formerly was called the balance of power , but the substitution for the one and the other of an international system under which both great and small States can be assured of a stable foundation and independent development . " I assume , as a matter of course , the evacuation by the enemy of the occupied territories of France and Russia . I have already referred to AlsaceLorraine and Belgium . But wherever you turn in Central and Eastern Europe you see territorial arrangements - which ire purely artificial in their origin . which offend the interests and wishes f the populations concerned and which remain seedpiots or potential war . " There are the Just claims of Italy . Rumania , and Serbia . There is Poland , concerning which , I believe , all our people heartily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cases of Greece and the Southern 31ays must also not be forgotten , and what is required is the permanent lqiiidation of all these dangerous ac3ounts . " Making War Against War . Coming to the second aspect of an nduring peace , Mr. Asquith said : " We must banish once for all from our catalogue of maxims the time-worn fallacy that if you wish for peace you must make ready for war . " I am not a sentimentalist , and do not expect the Sudden regeneration of mankind , wire , ' in the world 's war offices the lion will lie down with the lamb and inzernational relations become a perpetual love feast . I fear that even the youngest of us will not live to get more than a distant and imaginative glimpse of that beatific vision , but , speaking not as a Utopian or dreamy idealist , I assert that we are waging not only war for peace but war against war , and for the first time in history we may make , an advance to the realization of an ideal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such , for instance , as Henry IV . of France , who was not visionary but a practical statesman , have been groping their gay . - That is the ideal It is the creation not merely of a European , but , since our kinsmen across the Atlantic have joined us , of a world-wide policy , uniting the peoples in a confederation , of which justice will be the base and lioerty the cornerstone . The limitation of armaments and the acceptance of arbitration as the normal solvent of international disputes and the relegation of wars of ambition to the category of obsolete follies will be milestones on the road . " You will not at first , perhaps not for a long time , be able to dispense with coercion , military or economic , against the disloyal and recalcitrant , but we may well hope that the positive law , with its forcible restraints , may . gradually recede into the background and sovereign authority be recognized , to rest in the common sense of mankind . " It is impossible to believe that this universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic worlds . When the storm , has passed over must we not , after such common discipline which has spared no class In society , . see things that concern our daily lives and our relations to one another in a new and truer perspective than was ever possible before ? In the meantime we must keep our powder dry . " Mr. Asquith said that it would be a calumny on the nation to suggest that its spirit required to be aroused or sustained by any fresh justification of the righteousness of the cause for which it was fighting . The attainment of peace at the present moment , he said , was the supreme interest of mankind : it was worth any sacrifice  --  except the sacrifice of things which made peace worth having and which ensured its . stability by basing it on the solid rock of right , internationally recognized and guaranteed . Pence Can not Ignore Right . Peace in this sense could not be found in a cessation of active hostilities , followed by a process of territorial bargaining to be embodied ultimately in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a chapter of accidents , which had wisely been called " the bible of fools . " " Still less can you find peace worthy of the name , " he continued , " in any arrangement imposed by victor or vanquished , which ignores the principles of right and sets at defiance the historic traditions , aspirations and liberties of the peoples affected . Such so-called treaties contain within themselves their own death warrant and simply provide fertile breeding ground for future wars . " We have a crucial example of the folly and futility of such a transaction in the treaty of 1871 . That act of high , handed , short-sighted violence , against which Europe ought to have protested , is the primary cause of the race in armaments , which proceeded at an ever ! accelerated pace for forty years before the outbreak of this war . " Mr. Asquith said that both Bismarck and von Moltke foresaw the evil con , sequences of the treaty , von Moltke asserting that Germany must be armed to the teeth for fifty years to keep the provinces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
