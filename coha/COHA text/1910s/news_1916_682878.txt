txt Not only is Francisco Villa not dead . as many persons in the United States have believed , but , according to John 3. iHawes , who reached this city yesterday from the Texas border and who says Villa sent him as a personal representative to clear the good name of the Mexican rebel leader , Villa is now at the head of an army of 10,000 men in the State of Chihuahua . The Villa troops are fully equipped with arms . ammunition , stores in plenty , and between $4 , - 000,000 and $5,000,000 in gold bullion , says Mr. Hawes , and Villa 's double ambition now is to settle all internal disorders in Mexico , put in the Presidency a man whom Mexicans and citizens of this country alike can trust , and , finally , to establish beyond question that Villa had no bart in the raid on Columbus nor In the Santa Ysabel massacre . Hawes has established headquarters at the Waldorf . He frankly admits that his-put pose . ip solely to spread ITUlista propaganda . ' In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell , has nothing to buy , and desires only that tbe ttuth about Meilaestaill , be Irnochi. " lie has retained F. C. Simona , a lawyer , of 66 ' Broadway , as the legal adviser of his one-man junta , and for the next four ' or five weeks , at least . will be available always at one address or the other . According to Mr. Hawes . no power now in Mexico can keep Villa from this achievement . Already , according to his agent , he Is the practical ruler of Mexico and can make himself so In fact whenever he feels the time ready . The troops of Venustiatto Carranza are deserting to Villa daily , says Mr. Hawes . Villa is waiting only on the time when the United States shall be made to see that he is not the bandit he has been painted . that his objects are solely patriotic and that in his leadership ' lies sole hope of a settlement of the internal disorders that have stirred Mexico since the days of Porfirio Diaz . Watched pershtng 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be recognized by the United States as the , provisional ruler of Mexico , " said Hawes . " If you will pardon the expression , " continued Hawes , " Villa 's remark when he quit after Carranza 's recognition was , literally translated : ' They can all go to hell . ' And that 's just the way he felt . 1 saw him in Sonora , not far from Durango , when General Pershing 's column was searching for him . Villa and his friends had even ridden across country to get a sight of this column and had watched the United States troops who thought they were chasing him . " Then he went back to Sonora and , when I saw him a little of the bitterness had passed . Ile was worried over Mexico and the way things ' were going and already he was making preparations to get into the fight again . While he was lying dead in the mountains , as you thought , he was coining gold pieces from the stores of bullion which he had kept hidden for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money and he had many arms hidden also . Later , as you know , many Carranzistas deserted to him and they all brought . their arms . He got two batteries of artillery in the Chihuahua fight . " Already 1 had been a sort of agent Of his since November , 1910 , but it was not until last month that I assumed my present post . I spent the Summef up here . in the north and returned to Texas in the Fall . In El Paso I saw and talked with friends of Villa and , at their suggestion , finally made the trip to Sonora to-learn Villa 's plans and to advise with him out of my knowledge of conditions here . I round him again near Durango , and this time he had between 10,000 and 11,000 well-armed men with him He had machine guns and ambulances as well , and in every way had equipped a regular army- , " It was then we discussed his relations with the United States and the necessity for putting himself right before the American people . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left I had committed myself to my present mission . " Says Villa Wants Peace . Hawes asserted that the stories ? of Villa atrocities , of his connection with the Columbus raid and the Santa Ysabel massacre were all inventions of Carranzistas . " Villa will not attack Pershing , " he added , " although  --  the presence of the American column Interftres , of course , - - with his , plans . That is one thing we want to have thoroughly understood in America . Villa will bring peace in Mexleo if . the United States will let him . It need not recognize Villa . Just let them fight it out and I will guarantee that Within slaty days Villa will restore I order . Hawes said he had not seen villa since the meeting in November , and con sequently not since the fighting around Chihuahua , which occurred ? in the last week of the month . He said he did - not know when he should see Villa again , but promised that when the time was ripe American newspaper correSpondents would be conducted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement which he now made . That was a primary part of Villa's. plan to clear himself before the . United States . 1 and , said Hawes ; he was just as anxious as any one could be to bring about such a meeting .
