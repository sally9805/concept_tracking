 |p796  TOM HOOD , that playful wit , once imagined himself as riding in fancy 's aerial car over London and surveying the literary movements in progress under him . Could a modern critic thus join the aerial scouting fleet of literature and hover over America , what would he see ? We are not sure that his report would be in all respects accurate ; no contemporary 's ever was . Hood paid a grudging tribute to the passing vogue of " sweet L. E. L. , " a once popular magazine poetess , for whom , as for the Sadducee , there shall now be no resurrection . He ignored altogether Keats and Shelley , whose souls had reached heaven some years before , but whose poems had not yet reached a second edition among mortals . In the same way a modern literary aeronaut must expect to be deceived , partly by defects in his own eyesight and by intervening clouds of contemporary prejudice , partly through the camouflage of bumptious reformers and bellicose reviewers . Yet better an imperfect report than none . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car and see if report speak truth , if the old gods indeed be departing from Boston and new ones be working miracles in Chicago . The present is the child of the past , and our survey must begin with a retrospect . About ninety years ago an eminent publisher told John Clare that the popular demand for verse ran in waves , and history since his day has not belied his assertion . From 1800 to 1820 in England , poetry sold better than prose ; from 1825 to 1840 , it was a drug on the market ; after 1840 , another wave of enthusiasm rolled up , bearing Tennyson and several popular minors ad astra et ad aurum . The first decade of the twentieth century was everywhere one of general indifference towards poetry . With a few  |p797  brave exceptions , college faculties believed that we lived in an Alexandrian age , that it was better to encourage accurate texts of the dead than erratic enthusiasms of the living . Leading magazines wanted a limited number of pretty rhymed trifles for " fillers " ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page like the dust of Alexander stopping a bung-hole . Books of verse by our most prominent men of letters were published at their own expense ; and the bread thus cast upon the waters did not always come back even after many days . Connoisseurs and blue-stockings dismissed their contemporaries with one contemptuous phrase , to talk of Browning , Keats , and the Elizabethans . The man in the street seemed hardly aware that there was a thing called poetry ; and the rich undergraduate saw in it only another item for his semi-annual tutoring bill . With the second decade of the century came a reactionary wave of enthusiasm for verse . Noyes became popular around 1910 ; Masefield blazed up suddenly on the literary horizon in 1911 ; Gibson , Frost , and Masters in 1914 and 1915 ; and others in their wake . Ilow far the poets have created their public , how far the public has encouraged and stimulated the poet , no one can say precisely . In all such periods there has been a vast amount of reciprocal influence between readers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new enthusiasm was influenced by that great international upheaval which was synchronous with it , and began with the Balkan war of 1912 . Such popular movements are by no means always entirely wise , are far from being safe guides for the Wordsworths whom they abuse or the Byrons whom they pamper ; but the history of literature shows that great creative periods have usually coincided with these eras of national enthusiasm , that even the noblest genius can seldom make the bough of poetry blossom in the winter of an indifferent age . The hearts of eager thousands generate the electric current . It is for the leading writers and critics to direct this power , to decide whether it shall  |p798  become the amusing fire-works of a literary fad , the destructive lightning of a pernicious theory , or a power that shall illuminate and redeem the race . During the dead period following 1900 the two chief forces influencing American literature were the large universities and the standard magazines . They were the only oases in the literary Sahara , and even they were too much dominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty cult of Keats and the lyric tradition of Swinburne . Poetry must voice a mood of aesthetic retirement , in spite of the fact that what was noblest in American thought was associated with action and struggle . Poetry must have the " lyric cry " in spite of the fact that Americans are at once the most idealistic and the least musical people in the world . Poetry must be written in a style largely feminine , though the history of six thousand years shows that Corinnas have always been great for their contemporaries , and Pindars for posterity . In the academic atmosphere of that period there was something at once inspiring and barren . The literary recluse found his scholarly vision strengthened but his creative imagination chilled and dwarfed in the constant presence of dead colossi , vast as those of Abou Simbel . Slenderlimbed Pegasus may also have been reined in rather strictly to the academic furrow , yoked to the administrative warhorse on one side and the untiring , unpitying steam-tractor of science on the other . Yet the academic world of the decade after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Moody , besides many another dignified and lovable figure in verse among both faculties and alumni ; and among those who wrote nothing it generated more poetic enthusiasm than any other force of that time . Mainly for good , yet partly for evil , the universities exerted a powerful influence in continuing old literary traditions , stanza forms , and mental attitudes from the days of Spenser and Shakespeare , Keats and Tennyson . Like Lamb when the magazines rejected his offerings , the college world  |p799  until recently has cried , " Damn the age ? I will write for antiquity . " What is called the " new poetry " seems to be , and in some ways is , a reaction against the recent past . Up to 1914 none of its leading figures had been frequent contributors to our standard magazines ; and most of them had either ignored the usual periodicals or battered at such doors in vain . Their works were repeatedly parodied in the " good old standbys " ; and they answered with their own heavy artillery of contempt . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too severe for the academic world . It was , they believed , a modern Boeotia , stupefying the nascent poet with a malarial intellectual fog exhaled from old books and parchment-hunting pedagogues . Its theories were anathema in their essays and its poets " back numbers " in their reviews . It is true that the critical protagonists of the new movement proclaim their broad-minded sympathy with all genuine poetry in old or new channels ; but the tolerance of literary reformers , like the clemency of the emperor of Lilliput , is usually inversely as the statements about it . When one looks beyond superficial ripples , however , to the deep main streams of modern tendencies , the real struggle is not that of a new poetic school against old ones or even against an old Philistia . It is the struggle between a new era and an old , the steady inpouring of a new sea of thought , which has flooded certain districts earlier and more deeply than others but has splashed its foam over all . One can see many a white-cap of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The undergraduates of our large universities are one hundred per cent more literary than they were ten years ago ; and their ideas about poetry are a mass of undigested ingredients simmering in the caldron of reform . We members of the faculty seem to ourselves fairly interested in contemporary verse ; and even our friendly enemies of the " Poetry " magazine would probably opine that " the mummies are turning restlessly in their  |p800  sarcophagi . " Among intellectual circles everywhere , the conservatism which the literary reformers attack so acidly is becoming a thing of the past while they attack it , and they are discourteously speaking evil of the dead . The new , all-pervading wave of reform did not rise without occasion . It was needed in the first place for the sake of variety . Man shall not live by pentameters alone , and the rhymes which were newly wedded lovers in Chaucer 's day are such very , very old married couples now . More than that , the industry of the Teutonic philologist has reduced the old metres to statistical tables and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ground which he has sown with salt what flowers of poetry can blossom ? Beyond this , there is a much deeper reason . Every emotion has certain forms of expression through which it can utter itself adequately , and others through which it can not . The everyday feelings and everyday expressions of any age mould each other reciprocally , and fail to harmonize with emotions or rhythms of ages utterly dissimilar . Many ancient epics , it is believed , were neither talked nor sung , but chanted before ears accustomed to a chanting cadence ; and traces of that chanting rhythm are obvious in the blank verse of Milton and Tennyson . Unfortunately , modern Americans hear the beat of the chant only in churches , and very few of us even there . For those few it is a foreign exotic , a treasure from some Hebraic museum , no growth of our western soil . Also the chant seems traditionally to have been associated with a spirit of reverence , religious feeling , or epic hero worship ; and no less an authority than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In all ages there has been a certain amount of true lyric poetry , thought leaping spontaneously into song . It has been common among the singing races , the Slays , the Italians , the Irish , whose laborers sing at their work , and whose lovers in real life go serenading . In America , we pay well  |p801  for music from European prima donnas , but we are not a singing race . Moreover , pure song is the expression of a poetry largely emotional , and such poetry can only be great in an age which encourages emotion . We live in a scientific era when the intellect is forced so fast and driven so hard that feeling becomes subsidiary . The first requisite for a martial patriot is a knowledge of mathematics plus sanitation . Even the lover , before proposing to Highland Mary , is expected to read a scientific treatise on eugenics . As a result , all deep things in the life of the average American ? pathos , humor , irony , hope , admiration , pity ? have become associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but with the conversational voice . The funeral chant for him is merely part of a shopworn routine , but the spoken sympathy of a friend part of the poetry of life . The love songs of Burns and Shelley are exotics from Europe , but the soft-spoken confidences of his fiancee part of the glory of the universe . The thought and feeling of twentieth-century America flow naturally in a conversational rhythm and often seem to demand it . Rightly or wrongly , certain poets are leading a return to " the sweet music of speech , " as Wordsworth led the return to nature , and with the same ideal , namely , that they may write about a living cosmos instead of a dead convention . Whether they use a modified blank verse , as does Mr. Frost , the Chaucerian stanza-forms of Mr. Masefield , or unrhyming varied cadences like those of Mr. Masters , they are trying to make the sound " an echo to the sense " as they have heard the sound echo the sense on New England hills , on old England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we turn from new poetry in general to the particular department of it known as free verse , we find this by no means merely a reaction . The history of literature is full of sweeping changes , but those changes do not mean wholesale alterations in the literary faith of individuals , rather the passing of literary power from one party to another . Every  |p802  locality or class or type has to some extent an individuality of its own ; and this class or type or region grows vocal as that grows dumb . All men have not abandoned Toryism at heart ; but in the places of power the Tories are out and the Whigs are in . In America , Mr. Fletcher is , I believe , the only prominent free verse poet who has graduated from one of our large universities . The others either hold degrees from small western colleges or hold no degrees whatever . They are by no means uneducated or peasant poets , quite the reverse often ; but they have been trained in an atmosphere of modern experiment rather than of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful writers of free verse come from the Middle West . Miss Lowell is an exception ; but her unrhyming cadences are not " autochthonous " like those of Masters and Sandburg , are a foreign graft from the French poets whom she interprets so sympathetically . Most of the free verse masters , like the conversational Field and Riley before them , are the fellow countrymen of Lincoln , part of " the unexhausted West , " Broad prairie rather , genial , level-lined , Fruitful and friendly for all human kind . The French vers libre ? which is rhyming poetry in varying metres and generally very unlike English free verse in effect ? was less of a model than of a suggestive hint . The great role played just now by the new rhythms resulted originally from the spirit of a certain locality reacting to the general spirit of the age . Masters and Sandburg , who have lived consistently in the Middle West , excel in conversational humanism . Fletcher and Pound , who grew up in the same region and have since lived in England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new shoots from Keats and the Queen Anne wits respectively . Free verse by our Eastern poets , except the best of Miss Lowell 's , has generally rung clumsy and unconvincing . Untermeyer and Robinson in New York , and Frost in New England , have very wisely abided by modifications of the old standards .  |p803  There remains another important consideration . How many of the " new poets " have definitely accepted in theory the propaganda supposed to represent their movement ; and of these how many in practice live up to their belief ? According to the introduction of Miss Monroe 's recent Anthology the new poetry " would discard the theory , the abstraction , the remoteness " of by-gone verse . Yet many people , myself included , believe that one of the best poems of one of the best poets in that Anthology is Mr. Robinson 's " Man against the Sky " ; and this is no detailed picture of John Jones or William Brown , but a most abstract picture of abstract humanity . Miss Monroe also says that the new poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objective " ; and we turn to the works of Ezra Pound and find them from beginning to end little else than the " Book of Ezra . " A poem which does not contain the first personal pronoun is as rare as an oasis in Sahara . Miss Lowell says that at least the Imagist wing of the new poetry should " produce poetry that is hard and clear , never blurred nor indefinite . " We pick out at random the first lines we meet in an Imagist of her own choosing , Mr. Fletcher ; and we read the following : Old friends who will forget me soon , I must go on Toward those blue death mountains I have forgot so long . The adjective " blue " is the one above all others which in landscape suggests outlines blurred and indefinite . The description is as vague as Milton 's picture of Death , and , like that , good because of its vagueness . The effect produced here is simply a revival of effects found in Keats and Spenser and mediaeval allegory . Even Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion , seems none too orthodox in the shadow of his own cathedral . His recent volumes contain much poetry in traditional vein , which , whether written after the " Spoon River Anthology " or not , was considered  |p804  worthy of publication after it . A connoisseur of old tombstones , Greek or American , may find on them a likeness both rhythmical and typographical to the epitaphs on Mr. Masters 's pages ; and we suspect that the free verse of his Anthology owes as much to old cemeteries as to new systems . Yet at bottom what seems like a criticism of the new movement is really its chief justification . It is not a body of people shut off in a thought-tight compartment and mechanically standardized . It is a measure of leaven hid in many measures of humanity , leavening them all in different proportions ; and this is as it should be . On what is worst in the new poetry judgment is easy . The sun of public notice has bred the poetical maggot in many a dead dog . Most of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad because it has no sincerity ? is the imitative product of a fad . Because Masefield and Sandburg have seen beauty and brutality interwoven and described them so , therefore primitive savagery must be the mark of true inspiration , even in the case of mild-eyed aesthetes who do not know how to be brutal gracefully . A recent book of free verse is recommended to the public by the following publisher 's note : " You , gentle reader , will probably not like it , because it is brutally powerful and scornfully crude . Fortunately , neither the author nor the publishers care much whether you like it or not . The author has done his work , and if you do read the book you will agree that he does n't give a damn for your opinion . " Because certain keen minds have revolted against excesses of public prudishness , therefore weaker imitators must serve up the garbage of human thought as mental nourishment . We deplore frankly the reign in poetry of a canting secretiveness ; but there is one thing in literature which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thanks to the greatness of Whitman and the littleness of Mr. Dreiser , that is precisely what we are getting  |p805  Placid echoes about lubricity from thin-blooded bachelors and spinsters are not profound oracles regarding life . As for all the spineless prose that has been turned into poetry by one wave of typography 's magic wand , the vastness of its quantity is known only to angels and reviewers . Yet this huge mass of abortive work is by no means an ominous sign . Similar vast masses of rubbish have marked the greatest literary periods of our history , the Elizabethan drama , the early nineteenth century . The more noble and genuine products of the new poetry are naturally harder to evaluate . In the field of free verse we , like others , have read with enthusiasm . Yet at the same time , in regard to many of the most radical innovations we have been more charmed than convinced . We have had an uncomfortable remembrance of the fate of " Ossian , " how the literary and discerning men of the eighteenth century went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Russia , and how completely its magic has departed with the passing years . That also had about it the charm of novelty , of new moods and rhythms ; and now its own desolate halls of Balclutha are not more deserted than its pages . There are times when the new muse seems more like a brilliant actress than a permanently enjoyable wife ? a fascinating and freakish Cleopatra ; and we wonder with some misgivings if it indeed be true that Age can not wither her , nor custom stale Her infinite variety . Certain things , obviously , the new metres have not yet succeeded in doing . To date they have not proved a suitable medium for intense passion . The tragedies of " Spoon River Anthology " are burnt-out craters , not volcanoes in eruption . Even Carl Sandburg 's championship of the poor seems coolly observant compared with Hood 's " Song of the Shirt " or Elliott 's " Corn-Law Rhymes . " Nor has such verse proved suitable for the most exciting type of narrative . Scott 's description of Flodden or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? could we imagine these in free verse ? Nor does that medium lend itself well to outbursts of choric grandeur . Unless the new instrument develops greatly , we must pronounce it one of limited range , well fitted to play a single part in the vast orchestra of national literature , and that only . In some ways the greatness of what is best in free verse is the greatness of negation . Its most beautiful onomatopoetic effects are studies of very subdued sounds or even of silence itself . For instance , compare the " clang and clash and roar " of Poe 's " Bells , " or Milton 's Clamor such as heard in Heaven till now Was never with Harold Monro 's " Great City , " in which Like falling waters , falling , hissing , falling , Silence seemed an everlasting sound . One of Mr. Masters 's best poems is entitled " Silence . " Vachel Lindsay has found rhyme necessary when he wishes to make his " banjos bang . " Much of the vers libre descriptive poetry deals with gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rhymes and of prearranged places for ending the lines makes the medium of expression like a single large pane of glass , unobtrusive in itself , showing the object beyond it , where rhyme or blank verse crosses the object with a host of little subdivisions , like those of an old-fashioned diamond-paned window . Whether it be the effect of the metre or the age , much also of the thought in free verse has a negative turn . It has usually little of Blake 's or Shelley 's eagerness for reform , little of Pope 's or Byron 's ferocity in satire . Observant of life , like Browning , the authors have not his restless curiosity to trace each thread of emotion through its labyrinth . Everyone realizes that much bad " free verse " is merely prose arbitrarily printed . In one sense , however , this is also true of much vers libre that is good . In some cases the typog-  |p807  raphy of poetry seems justified ? and well justified ? mainly by the tendency of contemporary America to gulp down its books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monthly " recently printed an article entitled " The Fletcherizing of Literature , " the teaching of which can be guessed from its title . Much exceedingly good free verse of a certain type is really condensed , highly artistic prose printed in little morsels that the reader may pass each leisurely over his intellectual palate . This type of reform belongs more to the field of educational devices than to that of prosody . Future ages , I think , will find one of the noblest services of vers libre in the reaction which it is now producing in more traditional rhythms . Byron tells us that his association with ottava rima while in Italy influenced the Spenserian stanzas of " Childe Harold , " producing new pauses and runon effects . In the same way we find the cadence of free verse crossing the rhythm of Keats and other dead masters in the work of many promising young poets , Conrad Aiken , the Benets , and others . It would be a great mistake to suppose that the old models are generally discarded . Rather they have suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service is an interpreter of our own day , even if he writes in Kipling 's manner . Untermeyer is just as full of Keats as is the most washed-out imitator , only he is full of something else besides . This movement towards a conversational rhythm and diction , once launched , can not stop with a mere acceptance of the spoken word . In this problem we Americans , at least , face a peculiar difficulty owing to our national temperament . We have been as a race idealistic yet ashamed of our idealism . We have veiled emotion and visionary moods under matterof-fact expressions , and read each other 's more poetical feelings not through what was expressed but through what was implied . Our vernacular has been less poetical than our inner life , and a disguise for it fully as often as a medium for expressing it . When it was a question of revealing our deep-  |p808  est and holiest feelings , American English has often proved an inadequate medium ; and as thought and language influence each other , the current phrase has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If verse and the vernacular are to come together , we must have , not only something new in verse , but also something new in the vernacular . The thoughts of Dante , Chaucer , and Goethe made a home in humble speech ; and the simple language grew transformed around them like the cottage of Philemon . From 1900 to 1910 the language of life and the language of poetry had drifted too far apart , with bad results for both . From 1910 to 1918 poetry bent down to meet the language of life , and at times bent too far . Now after the solemnity and emotional stress of a great war , it is time that the language of life should rise half way to meet the poets , that it should be moulded in turn by the literature which it moulds , and that the spirit which lies behind all language , the nautilus that builds the ever expanding shell , should Stretch in its last found home and know the old no more . Much that is most beautiful in the latest free verse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verse , is already pointing in this direction . Furthermore , although the defenders of free verse have put us in their debt , it is false to say , as some of them do , that all great literature has been written in the language of even a noble contemporary speech . Spenser and Milton did not follow , in rhythm or diction , the conversations of merchants and club men in their day . In certain languages , such as Armenian and ancient Anglo-Saxon , poetry has differed so much from the vocabulary of everyday life that it has become almost another tongue . In our own country , too , when the first effervescence of democracy is over , there will be room for a poetical medium of expression , not conventional merely like that of Pope , but kept like a priestly vestment apart from the touch of everyday . It may not have a wide appeal , it may not form a large part of even our  |p809  best literature ; yet when it does occur , instead of condemning it hastily , we must recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early gods . " Free verse " and the " new poetry " are not synonymous terms . Some of the supposed vers libre is old-school , is really Addisonian or Dobsonian prose spoon-fed to children by the compositor , or else echoes from unrhyming choruses of ancient Greece . Much in Swinburnian and Chaucerian rhythms belongs to the rising day . What , then , is the fundamental characteristic of the " new poetry " at its best ? It is a matter , not of scansion or vocabulary , but of inner spirit . All details of diction and metre , where genuine , grow out of this spirit and its attempts to adapt itself to some given environment . The characteristic of the good new poetry is to accept , interpret , and ennoble the contemporary thought of our nation and make great literature out of that . The characteristic of the old poetry ? a tendency often noble but always dangerous to vitality ? was to turn one 's back on American thought as hopelessly prosaic ; to cling to some past crucifix or Parthenon ; to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dollar-hunters , " Come ye out from among them and be separate . " The new poetry says to the American people : " We have dug deep into the mines of your souls and found what is there . The rubies and diamonds out of which Dante and Milton built their shrines are not in you . But we do find scattered , hidden , unnoticed in the midst of seeming materialism , a vast amount of gold and silver that the old continents and dead ages never produced . We mean to mine and purify and forge this , and to show you in artistic form the beautiful side of your own natures , what you yourselves hardly realized , what no foreigner dreamed of . " That is the fundamental distinction between the new poets and the old . The new are miners of the national mind , the old importers and artificers of past or foreign thought . As has always been the case , many of our best poets will belong to both types when  |p810  their friends think that they belong only to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will think himself an interpreter of modern America because he has called his poem " Fifth Avenue " instead of " The Appian Way . " We can not form a clear conception regarding the present and future of American poetry without bearing in mind certain social and historical facts . If literature be a reflection of life , as we so often and so carelessly say , then an exceedingly variegated life might be expected to produce an exceedingly variegated literature . In the time of the Elizabethan drama the whole population of the English-speaking world did not equal that of New York State to-day ; the percentage of illiteracy was exceedingly high ; and practically the only intellectual centre in Great Britain was London . Even in the days of Keats and Shelley the entire Anglo-Saxon world hardly outnumbered modern Spain ; and nearly all its great poetry came from three districts , around the Lake region , London , and Edinburgh . To-day the English language is spoken by over two hundred million souls . It serves authors of almost every known race . Tagore of Hindustan is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Scandinavian , French , Spanish , German , Irish , Hebrew , and Mongolian blood . They have fed their artistic spirit from almost every kind of environment , prairie and mountain , Atlantic metropolis and arctic glacier . Means of communication between widely different regions were never so thorough . More than that , never before has there been such a spirit of international exchange in literary thought ; the Muses have gathered together unto the Parliament of Man , though the Kaisers and cannon-makers have not . In other great countries the tendency to multiformity in literature has been checked by the iron hand of political power . Russia has suppressed the national literatures of Finland and Ukrainia . The mailed fist of Germany has been at the throat of local song in Alsace and Lorraine . But in the United States we have a vast variety of foreign influences superimposed on a vast variety of local conditions and  |p811  racial traits , all left free by state and national governments to express themselves to the full . Many of these , of course , may not develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then we may look forward to such a complicated symphony of many voices as the world has never seen . Already the tides are turning in that direction . Narrow-minded disciples of vers libre may declare the old traditions dead , but the old traditions are going to be rejuvenated and live . Despite all hostile hyperboles , many a good thing will yet come out of Nazareth and " Academia . " Reactionary " classicists " may declare free verse a blend of vulgarity and anarchy ; but its best is not , and it is going to co-exist beside its older brethren . A conversational movement has produced a conversational poetry , which has shown its right to endure . It was a similar movement working in the old Elizabethan drama which broke down the end-stopped , rhetorical blank verse system of Marlowe 's " Tamburlaine , " and in the later plays of Shakespeare and Ford modulated the pentameter to the beat of the spoken word . With every year new keys are added to our poetic instrument , and the old retained . Even if some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their influences will not be passing . " Ossian " was the over-praised idol of an hour ; but the influence of " Ossian " leavened some of the greatest literature of the world . The laws of poetry are not those of politics . In future , American literature not only can , but must , live half traditional and half free ; and we must learn to welcome all genuine types as additions to our national heritage . Tolerance is part of the American spirit ; and whether we wish it or not , we are doomed to have it ? in verse as in religion . The result will probably be a large number of rather good poets instead of a few supreme masters ; but perhaps that is the natural result of a democracy . Such conditions would have at least one advantage ; they would enable the future historian of American poets to develop a series of portraits as numerous and as picturesquely diverse as those of Chaucer 's famous Prologue .               @ @ @ @ @ @
