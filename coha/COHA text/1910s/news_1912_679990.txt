txt Wild Rabbits . You published a letter which relates to the game law codification made by the last Legislature . Very few sportsmen who know anything of game conditions in our State will agree with your correspondent , bUt . I merely wish to call attention to his glaring error in regard to the breeding of wild rabbits . He says that rabbits are undeserving- of protection for many reasons and says also that they breed so fast and have so many young that a year 's close season would restore any depletion of their numbers . Wild rabbits are not like tame rabbits , and they breed but twice a ye.ar , as a rule having from three to seven young In each litter . Of course they are not rabbits at all , being In fact true hares  --  lying In forms and never in burrows , only in exceptionally bad Winter weather and even then these burrows ate either nature or man made and never the result of the " rabbit 's " labor .
