HAS Christ and His glorious message passed the German , uncomprehended , even unchallenged ? To be sure , the German makes the gesture of Christianity , but in his heart has he remained a pagan ? Martin Luther was vastly more the statesman than the religious rebel . His true religion expressed itself signally when lie hurled an inkwell at Satan , whose corporeity Luther did not doubt for a moment . Roon 's remark , after reading Bismarck 's fateful Emms message , " Our God of old lives still and will not let us perish in disgrace , " was ably rejoined by Moltke , " If I may but live to lead our armies in such a war , then the devil may come and fetch away my old carcass . " As to that blasphemer de luxe , Nietzsche , a far greater , significance lies in the fact that he is a product of Germany , than in his compendium of paganism . Who is this " Our old God , " ever recurring in important speeches , exhortations of troops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jehovah ? The wine-bibbing Dionysius , or mighty Wotan , blood-smeared and mead-soaked ? Witness a gathering of " brothers in beer " at the roundtable ? artists , students , clerks , all toasting " Our old God . " With raised glasses , one hand bracing against the table , " Our old God , may He prosper , " while at the next table a pudgy priest smiles benignly and sips his Liebfrauenmilch , vintage 1880 . Doubtless , it is the German 's own special God . Always " Our . " Our own , particular , dear old God . When Prince Bismarck uttered the stentorian " We Germans fear God and nothing else in the world , " he challenged the universe , backed by " Our God . " Bismarck 's fear was a kind of proud reverence , such as one king owes to another king , a  | sort of noblesse oblige . There is nothing in it of the humble Christian spirit that stands in awe before the majesty of the Divine . ( Knowing the Bismarckian temper , one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) It breathes a condescending tribute to the deity , who has done very well , indeed . The Teuton asks his God to seal and deliver , to forgive , because he , too , errs . He offers thanks to God , sincerely and dutifully . But not in that humble spirit which differentiates between Anglo-Saxon piety and German veneration . The down-in-the-dust attitude , the equality in meekness before the Lord , is as foreign to the Germanic mind as is the true understanding of the gospel of love . The Man of infinite sorrows interests the Teuton mainly as a symbol . Christ as a reality is at best an historic question to the German . Religion does not enter in the German 's life as a concommitant of existence , rather as a superimposed code of morality . Vague and hazy , in a similar sense as his idealistic , metaphysical philosophy . Contrary to the Anglo-Saxon , whose Christianity is deeply rooted and ranges from implicit faith to belief based on scientific inquiry , whose mundane knowledge the greater extended becomes the more solid a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its simple form accepts God as semi-anthropomorphic ; but adheres less to Christian fundamentals as its intellectual horizon widens . Ultimately , it welds together God , world-contemplation , the thing in itself , et al . A misty pantheism . Such a religious conception is thoroughly elastic and allows the Germanic mind to swing from God to Pan , to Wotan , to Supreme Intelligence , to Spinoza 's God is All . On the one hand Haeckel 's cell-soul , and , on the other , the present German Emperor 's sincere conviction that the responsibility for his people 's welfare lies alone with him and God . A riotous hobnobbing with deity . The Germanic God idea is less religious than relational . The Teuton brings God right to his hearth . He looks upon God as a superkinsman . Sometimes a powerful , influential relation who can do a great deal for one , who has done His best despite the fact that one did not follow His advice .  | Again , God is a brother , very experienced , very success till , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Him on important matters . Other times , God is a father . Ile knows what is good for the German . Of course , one 's father may be a little behind the times , now and then , but always He is the head of the family and it behooves the eldest son to insist that the family preserve the decorum of father 's dignity and position . The eldest son understands , he is more or less " in the know " ; father tells him much that the rest of the family can not be told . In return , the eldest son realizes an added responsibility toward both , father and family . He takes over part of father 's burden , proud of father 's confidence . An ideal religious concept for the bourgeoisie . To the peasant and children , God is quasi-anthropomorphic . A bearded man in flowing robes , very old . A rubber stamp serves for all the saints . The peasant plods along the dusty road and comes to a tiny chapel . It is consecrated to the holy Virgin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a string . The authentic sole of the holy Virgin 's slipper . The peasant kisses it reverently and prays a few Ave Marias . ' Twenty rods farther on , he comes to another chapel . Another , equally authentic slipper-sole hangs from a string by the altar . If he reasons at all , he concludes that the holy Virgin has had two slippers . If he finds several more slipper-soles , and reasons ( which is doubtful ) , then the holy Virgin surely possessed more than one pair of slippers . As to the authenticity of all the soles , the priest said so , it must be so , basta . When he falls ill and lingers he undertakes a pilgrimage to the nearest miracle church , any miniature or life-size Lourdes . There he spends many hours in quiet prayer , and if he feels better he donates a waxen , silver or golden leg ? if it was his leg that bothered him . If he feels no better he peregrinates to another miracle church . It did not work one time , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind that he was not worthy , perhaps , in the eyes of God and the Saints . It is preferable that the fault lies with the latter . This is important , and the principal reason that one never 229 finds religious paroxism and bedlam in Germany . The re ligious Sadist , the flagellant , the self-maimer , is unknown in Germany . Neither does the German ever " get " religion , or " hit the trail . " There is no humbleness in the Anglo-Saxon definition , in the German before God . Mainly because there is no Christ in Germany . While the Anglo-Saxon gradually has come to recognize the life and teachings of Christ as the sublimate of religion , the German adheres to God of the Old Testament . " Our Father Thou art in Heaven . . . . " is to the German of far greater importance than " Christ is risen . " This is not strange in the light of Germanic religious history . The teachings of the Nazarene , His gospel of Love , His Golden Rule , find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are most interesting from an historic , or bibliographic , point of view , but the German has never absorbed their substance . A race of nomadic barbarians , virile and energetic , swamped the Roman Empire and exchanged Wotan , Freya , Thor , Loke , etc. , for God , Angel Gabriel , Lucifer and the saints . Christ did not appeal to this belligerent race that had considered death on the battlefield the sole key to Walhalla . " There , Wotan welcomed the bleeding warrior with a hollowed bison 's horn full of mead . To spend the hereafter at the round-table , in company of bearded , battle-scarred warriors , presided over by the mighty Wotan , entertained by recitals of terrific combats , forever feasting on barbecues and vast quantities of mead , forever welcoming new arrivals , mortally wounded warriors picked up from the battlegrounds by the Walkyre ? those stalwart women in armor ; who rode fiery horses over the field of battle to select the fallen heroes worthy of Walhalla . " Love thy neighbor . . . " , not until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . . . " , what then is the prerogative of the strong ? It was but natural that these lusty barbarians accepted Christ with misgivings , under inward protest . But God , the Almighty Host of Hosts , they could easily conceive as a Wotan redevivus . Somewhat tempered , to be sure , less of the spirit of eternal combat , more of blessings for the husbandman . As if Wotan had grown from stormy youth to ripe middle age . Still stern , even wrathful at times , but more contemplative and reasonable on an average .  | And away back in the barbarian 's head remained a hope that the Wotan of old would some day return . The Gotterdammerung , . . . Dammerung , not Tod , twilight of the gods , not death , . . . a transitory condition only . After Dammerung , night . And then , Morgenrothe , . Dawn . The attitude of the German intellectuals toward religion is rather complex in expression . A kaleidoscope of Ultramontane Catholicism , Evangelical-Lutheran Protestantism , free-thinking of all sorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's recantation , Heackel 's stout monism , comprise only a part of Germany 's latter-day religious abracadabra . There is an increasing tendency to reject all religion and accept a suitable philosophy instead . The German reads into history that all those races and nations that had outgrown religion came to accept a philosophy of negation , which brought about their decay . An effectively triumphant philosophy must be hard , and ruthlessly destroy the greatest part of our previous beliefs . The masses prefer easy-going individualism to stern paternal state regimentation . Christianity gives a soul to the beggar as well as to the king . Christianity effects democracy , which , frees the masses . They become unwieldy and soft by the gospel of Love . It is best that they should retain their furor teulonicus of old . Meanwhile , before this all-important philosophy of " to do " has been perfected , the less said of Christianity the better . The other Christianity , that of " Our old God , " of the Old Testament , is less democratic , less effete . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Religious liberty , so long as Christ is kept humble without contaminating the masses . If they want to wallow in idealistic mysticism , if they do compare God to Wotan and- find the latter more congenial , very well . Thus the ring of . reason of the German elect . True , Christ has been talked about , his teachings examined , dissected rather , discussed . He has found a  | special niche in recent German literature . ( Gerhard Haupt man 's " The Fool in Christ , " Frenssen 's " Hilligenlei , " Suderman 's " John , " Widman 's " The Saint and the Animals , " Kellerman 's " Der Tor , " etc . However , this literary movement was stigmatized as " Jesus Kultur , " and pointed out as proving nothing beyond Jesus the man , Himself ever striving after truth , ever doubting . How decidedly less abstract conceptions , how much better understood nomenclatures are " the Wotan line , " . . . . " the Siegfried line .  |     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
