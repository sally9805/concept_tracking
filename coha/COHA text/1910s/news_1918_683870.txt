txt Correspondent was received today by the French General who checked the German offensive at the most critical phase of its development . Calmly and logically he developed his conception of the situation , saying : " The great German offensive has been checked definitely and an offensive that is checked is an offensive that has failed . " What matter if the enemy gains ground here or . there in operations of secondary Importance . That can not affect the issue ; he has failed and he knows it . We stopped them in full career when they were flushed by victory to a supreme effort . We shall hold them now more easily . " You can not judge this war like other wars . This war has been one gigantic battle , lasting four years with opponents always in contact . The tide of success has swayed now this way and now that as it did in the briefer battles of the past at Jena . Austerlitz or Marengo . But If the issue has long been undecided , it Is none the less certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeat follows implacably . Now or Never for the Foe . " The Germans have been forced to attack us . They dare not wait because they know that America 's millions are hurrying to help us . For them it is now or never . " They are not yet at the end of their tether . Already they have engaged in this battle a great number of their divisions on the whole French front . After losses such as theirs , a division , hastily reorganized and thrown back into line , is more than 50 per cent . below the former efficiency . Perhaps the enemy can count on fresh divisions , capable of vigorous action . " Wherever they hit , they will fail . Then It will be our turn . " In this huge four years ' battle , as in the past , victory goes to the side that is most master of its nerves . The will to win is greatest of all factors . Moral superiority can triumph even over material disadvantages . Now both are on our side . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morale is failing daily . You can exalt an army 's morale for a time by extravagant promises of success and by an elaborate program , such as the Germans followed , of encouragement by propaganda . But there is bound to be a corresponding reaction when these hopes are not realized . " In this supreme moment of the war it is mastery of nerves that will turn the scale - nerves not only of armies . but of civil population . It is there that Cu- role of the press is so highly important . It is your duty to strengthen the nerves of the people at home , not by wild and unfounded optimism , but by plain ' statement of Ate factors in our favor , so that they may present a firm and unbreakable front behind ' their lead- ; ers , and so that these leaders may gain strength therefrom to choose and follow coolly and fearlessly the road that runs straightest to victory . " Pays Tribute to the British . This General was in reserve when the offensive broke . Two days later his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some divisions were aiding the British to withstand the onrush of enemy masses three or four times their number . Napoleon once said that the test of a great General is success in retreat rather than victory . If that be true , this modest , unassuming little man is one of the great war 's greatest commanders , for never were the conditions less favorable than when he took charge of the operations on March Here are his own words : The British had had bad luck . Taken unawares by a deluge of gas and high explosive shells and a crushing German superiority , they were in danger of losing cohesion . But I can not pay too high a tribute ? to their courage and to the loyal devotion with which the British corps commanders executed my orders . The British artillery ( my own was still en route ) gave invaluable support . Despite their losses , the men of the British Fifth Army held out magnificently , side by side with the French , until the arrival of my successive divisions enabled them to be withdrawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciation of British co-operation . " In short , this General established order out of confusion , and renewed the connection that for a time had been broken in the face of furious assaults by an enemy whose morale was exalted to the highest pitch by victory beyond his hopes . What the situation really was I may , perhaps , now be allowed to relate . In the first days cavalry divisions , but three battalions strong , were strung across ten-mile stretches of the front without any artillery , save a few cannon on armored cars , and had " resisted to the death " as their only order . Had not the unquestioned air superiority of the ' Allies driven the German aeroplanes to cover , it is a question what would have happened . At one moment there was a weak point several miles wide in the allied line . That the measures taken by the French command are worthy to rank with Foch 's daring manoeuvre at the Battle of the Marne has been corroborated beyond the shadow of a doubt by the testimony of prisoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the way in which the French troops were flung forward in hot haste as they arrived . " One division , - he said , " was rushed up in camions just as the Germans were similarly bringing up reinforcements . Airmen told how they saw the two long lines of cars rushing toward each other along a broad , straight road until the heads of the columns were so close that it seemed that they were actually about to come into collision . On both sides the men disembarked from the vehicles right on the firing . line and ( what was quite unprecedented ) the leading files deployed immediately to cover the disembarkation of the remainder . " Thus outnumbered five , four , and never less than three to one , the French achieved the impossible . and on March alt had established their line in ' the posit ion where it now as . That day and ti:P next . the Germans made the greates ! attacks of all . F ; vorywhere , in the ( : ? . - neral 's own pi , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " save in. the neighborhood of Plemont- and Plessis . Park , in the : . entre , where , at the price nt fea , - ful losses a crack division of storm - , roops succeeded in bending the French line . The same night a counterattack recovered all ground lost , took Sou prisoners , and revealed over 2,000 German dead , 7acrificed in vain at that one point . Th'nceforward the German flood was dammed . It is small wonder that the General 's confidence is ab50 lute .
