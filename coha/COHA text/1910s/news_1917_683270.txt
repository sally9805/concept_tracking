txt News is property , the law protects the property right In news . These principles are laid down In the case of The Associated Press against the International News Service , controlled by W. R. HEARST , in an opinion which proceeds from the clear mind and firm hand of Justice CHARLES M. HOUGH of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals . The opinion is an admirable example of legal reasoning . For the general reader who has no special concern with the matters determined it is of interest from its literary form and because of the clearness with which the principles and the conclusion are stated . For the legislator , whether at Washington or in the State capitals , it is , we should say , of extraordinary value as an admonition that every new condition arising in modern business practice does not call for a new statute . The principle that the law has a remedy for every wrong is very strikingly illustrated in the decision of the Circuit Court in this case . The question whether a co-operative association engaged in gathering news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and using their news dispatches to their loss and disadvantage is comparatively new , but the Court corrects the abuse by applying perfectly familiar principles of law , no new statute is required . And that is true of a Multitude of wrongs or abuses springing up in the modern business world for which legislators have thought it necessary to produce an ever-increasing flood of new legislation . In this case Judge HAND of the District Court granted an injunction restraining the defendant from bribing members of the staffs of The Associated Press newspapers to supply it with news gathered by the association . There remained the question of news taken by the International Service from bulletins or early editions of The Associated Press newspapers in the East to supply it to clients of the International Service in the West , where it would be published simultaneously with the issue of The Associted Press newspapers . ' That question Judge HAND referred to the Circuit Court . The majority opinion of the Circuit Court . from which Judge WARD dissented , sustains the plaintiff 's contentions as to its property right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion written by Justice Hounu he declares , as the foundation principle , that " there is no doubt " either on reason or authority that " there is property right in news cape " his of and entitled to legal protec " tion . " Everything that has an exchangeable value , he declares , is property , and " that news possesses " the quality stated ' seems obvious " enough when it is observed that the " defendant takes it in order to ex " change it against dollars . " The defendant 's claim is briefly recited in the opinion : Defendant justifies bodily appropriation without independent investigation , because ( 1 ) all plaintiff ever has in possession or for communication are facts ; ( 21 all defendant takes are facts , and ( 8 ) there can be no property in facts ; but ( 4 ) if there be any such property it is lost eo instant ! any member of plaintiff , in accordance with its own rules . publishes said facts by showing a bulletin or distributing an edition . The Collet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called a " nose for news . " It presents a very Interesting view of the nature of news : With the existence of a truth , with physical facts per se , ' neither plaintiff nor defendant Is concerned ; for them facts in that absolute sense are but as ore in a mountain or fish in the sea ? valueless unless and until by labor mined or ca.ight for use . Nor are facts , even after ascertainment , news unless they have that indefinable quality of interest which attracts public attention . Neither is news always synonymous with facts , in the sense of verity ; indeed , much news ultimately proves fictitious  --  yet it is excellent news notwithstanding . The ' word =Ma no more ( laying aside hoaxing end intentional falsehood ) than : sp . Parma/ autbentie reports of current events of Interest . In the publication of news " time is of the essence . " U therefore . became necessary for the Court to inquire " ' how long does the property . quality endure in news ? " The Associated Press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each In its own locality " a several right to ownership " and the results of the association 's " labors . " And this several right is asserted to be equal and indisputable whether it be exercised in New York or San Francisco . The aggregate of these several rights is the right of The Associated Prase . If it be admitted , therefore , that The Associated Press has a property right in its news , then all its members have a property right , notwithstanding the fact that they , " owing to the earth 's method of rota " tion , can not simultaneously exercise " their several rights . " The disclosure of news in the early edition of a New York newspaper is not an act , the Colt says , of which the defendant or anybody may take advantage , to deprive the San Francisco members of The Associated Press of their property right In the news , their right , to receive the reasonable reward of their membership . This means , says the Court , that the news of The Associated Press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members . until , " with " due allowance for the earth 's rota " tion , " the " plaintiff 's most Western " member has enjoyed his reward ; " which is not to have his local corn " petitor supplied in time for comps " tition with what he has paid for . " Surely this is a modest limit of " right . " The plaintiff 's right in news as property is not a literary right , and copyright decisions can not be held to limit the lawful business of gathering and publishing news " to a few degrees of longitude . " Publication of Associated Press news in New York can not be held to terminate the equal rights of the other members of The Associated Press published in Western cities , and the International News Service , in appropriating Associated Press news from early editions of New York papers and sending it to its own clients in the West , deprives The Associated Press and Its members of their property and the lawful reward from its use . This practice constitutes unfair competition : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sells it as of right , in rivalry with the owner , such competition is more than unfair , it is patently Unlawful . and the wider term cornprises the narrower . But laying aside the right of property as the ultimate foundation of suit , the business method of selling in competition with plaintiff and its members , something falsely represented as gathered by defendant otherwise than from bulletins and early editions , is unfair , because it is parasitic and untrue . It is immoral , and that is usually unfair to some one . The Court , therefore , remands . the case to the District Court , with directions to issue injunctions against " any " bodily taking of that , words or sub " stance of plaintiff 's news until its " commercial value as news has , in the " opinion of the District Court , passed " away . " This puts an end to a flagrant and much-practiced abuse . It extends the protection of the law to The ' Associated Press and each of its members who , by the expenditure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmute facts into news , and thus acquire what they have always believed to be a valid property right . The decision of the Circuit Court is of great importance to newspapers and their news-gathering agencies .
