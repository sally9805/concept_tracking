 | I HAVE recommended to the President , and the recommendations have received his approval , a new plan for the increase of the Navy . The estimates , calling for $217,652,173.32 , provide for an increase of nearly $68,000,000 over last year 's appropriations . The adoption of a five-year program of new construction will be urged . Heretofore the policy has been for a Secretary of the Navy to propose a program for a single year , but experts , in and out of the Navy , feel that the five-year program will give us a better proportioned Navy than if it should be authorized piece-meal , year by year . Those who have studied this program have observed that it provides for fighting craft and reserves of ammunition . Only the peace essentials in auxiliaries are included . But we all know that in war proper auxiliaries are a prime essential . Most of these are procured by purchase , as we did in the Spanish-American war , or by commandeering merchant ships , as European countries have done in this war . This means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount for construction , under the recommendations for the next fiscal year , is $95,372,127 , of which $57,003,000 is for new construction . About $28,000,000 will be required for continuing the program of new construction authorized by the Sixty-third Congress ; $8,000,000 will be needed for increase in munition reserve , and $2,000,000 for aviation . The General Board recommends a larger dreadnought . If the increased size is built , each new battleship will cost , including armor and armament , $18,800,000 . A portion of this increase may also be attributed to the greater cost of materials . It may be that these prices will be reduced . If so , Congress will not have to appropriate so much . It may have been observed that the Navy Department is steadily increasing its policy of fitting navy yards to build ships and making government plants ready to manufacture large quantities of the munitions of war . For the first time in our history an award has been made to build three submarines in navy yards and destroyers in other yards . It is my purpose to fit every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have two reasons . One is that the government has invested many millions of dollars in these yards and unless this investment is utilized for new construction much of it is wasted . By building ships in these yards we increase the country 's capacity for turning out ships . The second reason is that if the government itself is prepared to construct naval craft , private shipbuilding companies desiring contracts must compete with government yards . Naval yards or establishments , however , must not only be able to build ships , but they should be equipped to manufacture a portion of all munitions of war . Take the manufacture of powder . A few years ago the government paid 80 cents a pound to a private manufacturer for making powder . After an investigation Congress fixed the price at 53 cents . In a short time the Navy will be manufacturing in its own plant at Indian Head all the powder it needs , at a cost of something like 25 cents a pound . There is another reason why the Navy Department should be able to manufacture munitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by those who make a profit by the manufacture of war supplies . The incentive of personal aggrandizement by preparations for war should not be permitted to exist in the United States . The Navy Department is committed to the policy outlined in the foregoing paragraphs . My recommendations to Congress also include an appropriation to enable the Navy Department to manufacture its own armor plate . In Cleveland 's last administration Secretary Herbert recommended the erection of an armor plate factory , but no action was taken . In 1900 the sum of $4,000,000 was appropriated for a " factory for the manufacture of armor , " but the naval appropriation act declared that the Secretary of the Navy need not build the factory " provided such contracts ( for armor plate ) can be made at a price which in his judgment is reasonable and equitable . " No factory was built . The price of armor plate in 1906 was $346 per ton . It jumped in 1907 to $420 per ton and the last competitive contract included the non-competitive prices of $425 to $486 per ton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress authorized , the government would have saved enough on armor plate to pay for the plant many times over . Another important need is for a projectile factory . Experience in Europe teaches that the Navy should not longer rely upon private manufacturers for projectiles . We are now , for the first time , manufacturing three-inch and six-inch shells in three navy yards , and if Congress approves we will erect a large factory which will turn out a large product of fourteen-inch armor-piercing shells , as well as the smaller projectiles . In order to provide a sufficient number of men to man the large number of ships which will be commissioned in the near future , I have recommended an increase of 7500 sailors , 2500 apprentice seamen , and 1500 marines , or 11,500 men in all . This number , it is estimated , will enable us to keep in full commission all battleships under fifteen years of age , all destroyers and submarines under twelve years of age , one-half the number of cruisers , all the gunboats , and the necessary auxiliaries for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complements for the remaining vessels of military value and for the shore stations . All " of this accords with the recommendations of the General Board . The great majority of enlisted men must , as apprentice seamen , pass thru the naval training stations , where they are taught the rudiments of education and undergo preliminary training , lasting from four to six months , to prepare them for duties aboard ship . It has become necessary , therefore , to increase the number of apprentice seamen . There should be also an increase in the number of line officers to officer the ships soon to be commissioned , but as the Naval Academy is the only source of supply the increase recommended is in the midshipmen . Recommendations will be made to increase their number at the Academy by not less than 250 . The European war has shown the necessity for a skilled flying corps , whose members need not be experienced naval officers or educated as such , in view of which a special flying corps , to which expert civilian flyers may be appointed , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a field for service for the increasing number of competent aviators willing to join such an arm of the service who can not and could not hope , under prevailing conditions , to do so unless they either enlisted in the Navy or graduated from the Naval Academy .
