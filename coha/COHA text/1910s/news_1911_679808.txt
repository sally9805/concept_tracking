txt First Duty of the statement made Seemingly by Mr. DARROW in dePlaced Last , Tense of his course in allowing or compelling both of the Manamanas to make unconditional pleas of guilty with that in which Judge BORDWxLL reviews the several steps by which the determination to confess was reached , shows a curious discrepancy between the two  --  a discrepancy which stems to demand a further explanation from Mr .. DARROW . The situation that confronted Mr. DARROW , as he feelingly and no doubt truthfully describes it . was this : He knew and long had known that both of his clients were guilty as charged , and that the prosecution had in its possession evidence that made their conviction inevitable . " To go on under such circumstances , " he says , " would have been madness , " and again he ears : " I can conceive of no way in which we could justify ourselves and not save the lives of our clients . Our first duty as lawyers and men was to the lives in our charge . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is good lawyer logic , whatever laymen may think as to anybody 's " duty " to save murderers from the legal Penalty of their crime . But judge BonnWELL gives some additional information , of which Mr. DATtROW'g statement slipplies no hint , though it is interesting . important , and essential to accurate judgment of what happened , and this information must of course be accepted as correct . The first proposition of the defense to the prosecution , the Judge declares , was that the younger brother would confess on condition that he should escape the gallows and that the older brother should go free . When this offer was rejected , another was made  --  James would confess and he hanged , if the court so decided , but again on condition that John should be saved . Only after that offer , too , had been refused was the one presented which accomplished what Mr. DARROW says was his " first duty . " In other words , Mr. DARROW wanted to save both lives if he could , but , finding that to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightly about his clients , he was willing to sacrifice one of the lives , if need be , in order to buy , not the life , but the liberty , of John . That , now . is not in accord even with lawyer-logic , as we understand it , and there will be keen impatience to hear how Mr. DARROW harmonizes the two . Btrtaiia 's Commissioner Injustice report on Dr. Dory , natuExcitds rally enough , has filled the Protests . members of the medical profession with anger. , Their emotion would have been amazement as well were it not that the report is exactly - what was to be expected from an " investigation " r conducted as was that with which the guardian of our port was harassed while engaged in a. desperate struggle to protect it when its danger was greater than ever before . In their appeals to tile Governor not to lake the advice to dismiss Dr. DOTY , his friends call attention , as did we yesterday , to the fact that the Commissioner makes no mention of the testimony given by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commendation of such part of the quarantine methods as came within the field of their special knowledge . They protest , too , against the Commissioner 's acceptance and use as proof of evidence given by witnesses whose opinions as to medical procedure were made worthless by gross ignorance and whose good faith was rendered suspect by personal grievances against the Health Officer . About the complete refutation of much of this incriminating testimony the Commissioner says nothing whatever in his report . Indeed , from anything that appears in these findings , the Governor , unless otherwise enlightened , might assume that Dr. Dory 's conduct of the Quarantine Station was wholly bad , and that from among the millions whom he was paid to serve , not one man had come forward with a word of commendation . These peculiarities of the report explain , even if they do not justify , those who , bolder than we would care to be in the ascription of motives , are openly declaring that the object of the investigation was to find colorable pretexts for giving Dr. DOTY 'S salary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , but appearances are often deceptive , and Judge BOLGER is a man of good repute among his neighbors . Had he confined his criticism to the evils he really discovered , and his recommendations to those which his discoveries warranted  --  had he said that the business methods at Quarantine were about those which a man earnestly engaged in wholly different matters might be expected to adopt or permit , and that they ought to be reformed and Put in other hands , leaving the Health Officer free to devote all his time to his proper duties  --  then nobody could or would have complained . It is no discredit to Dr. DOTY that better business men than he can be found . Not a few of us have our Justice Is doubts as to both the proSwift PrietY and the utility of . Oncecapital punishment , but for while the law makes death the penalty for murder there is no question that such prompt and stern enforcement of the law as has been seen in White Plains this week is worthy of commendation . It is also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishment of whatever value as a deterrent it can be , whether that value be little or great . The killing of these five ignorant and degraded ruffians will be a hideous episode in our social history , and one of which none of us can be proud , but if the thing is to be done at all , this is the way to do it . And the contrast between these trials in the brevity and the result and the trials of other murderers which we only too well remember , is not , as some are saying , and more are hinting , proof that there is one justice for the poor and another for the rich . Whether it is or is not proof that there is Justice for the poor and mercy for the rich and influential ? that is a different question and the answer to it is not either easy or obvious . The crimes of the two classes are as unlike as their social ranks , and it is not unnatural or necessarily wrong that the members of one go to the electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of the other are years in getting there or escape it altogether .
