Mr. Moon , however , does not expect great difficulty in obtaining its passage . He has made an inquiry-into the whole subject , and has gathered facts which he believes will convince Congress of the necessity of such a. law .

He was sounded thoroughly , and then a flat offer of $25,000 was made to him for complete detailed drawings and photographs of the defenses on Corregidor Island . The prize was tool big to resist , and an agreement was reached . As he was the official photographer for the department , the engineer had no trouble in getting his material . No one suspected him as he went along taking photographs of the interior works at Corregidor .

They were , beyond doubt , the result of a careful , painstaking , and deliberate search of the confidential records of the United States . The War Department has not yet solved this riddle . The department files contain abundant memoranda of the persistent activity of foreigners and citizens of the United States in mapping the Pacific Coast from Log Angeles to Seattle .
