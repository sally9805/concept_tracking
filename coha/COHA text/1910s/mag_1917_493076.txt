Me NeW REPUBLIC A Journal of Opinion OLUME XIII New York , Saturday , December 29 , 1917 Number 165 MERICANS who wish to understand what is taking place in Europe should be grateful to the New York Times for its enterprise III cabling to this country a complete transcript of c'c'Yo George 's recent speech in the House of e0:4Mons . The mutilated version which had been cabled through the ordinary news agencies omitted ( ) Y mention of two of its most significant passages . tnL.e cf these was the Premier 's reference to the a ti ue of the Allies towards the peace negotia-:Rs between the Russian and German ggovern-mentswhich is commented on elsewhere . The Shrq , er concerns pending negotiations between the foltish trades-unions and the government , having wedtileir object the release of the latter from veirges made early in the war , which have pre-rated the military authorities from calling to the is : I 'S certain additional men , whose use as soldiers 4d ? W deemed to be necessary . The decision to eati ( 1 still further to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : of the grim determination of our English whi etates to omit no precautions and sacrifices spur ch May be necessary to success , and it should this country on to follow England 's example . The training of additional American troops will not enable the American army to count any more effectively in 1918 , but , as we have already pointed out , it is time already to look forward to 1919 . The threat of the presence on the firing line during 1919 of over a million Americans rather than half that number would force the German Staff to husband its reserves during the fighting of the coming spring and summer . It is to be hoped that the British government will succeed in obtaining from the trades-unions a release from its pledges , and that the trades-unions will in return secure from the government that modification in its war diplomacy upon the desirability of which the trades-unions leaders have recently been insistent . 4 UT if , through our exhaustion we had to accept the Kaiser 's terms i. e. offensive terms we would do so to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus does Trotzky attempt to reassure those who fear that the peace Germany is in a position to impose will prove humiliating to Russia . The underlying reasoning , however , is not very cogent . A German proletarian uprising is probably remote : the German political and military organization has infinitely greater tensile strength than the Russian organization shattered by the revolution . If the German ruling class really feared that such an uprising could make head , supported by Russian forces , they would now be impelled to impose upon Russia terms so drastic as to insure a long period of anarchy and impotence . Russia may obtain from Germany peace terms that are moderate , in view of the collapse of her army . But if she does obtain such terms , it will be solely because the former allies of Russia are keeping up the fight . This fact may dictate moderation to Germany in her dealings with Russia . Russia may refuse to help to secure satisfactory terms of peace for us , but if she gets satisfactory terms for herself , it will be by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if we are tempted to regret that Russia still profits from our labors , let us remember that but for Russia 's tremendous sacrifices in the early part of the war , Germany would now be absolutely supreme upon the continent of Europe . And further let us remember that German supremacy may yet be established , however the war goes , unless we help Russia to secure a peace that secures her independence . FTER all American talk about the sacrifices America is making for the Allies , the figures produced by Mr. Hoover respecting American consumption of sugar are enough to make Americans feel uncomfortable and look hypocritical . The plain facts are that American consumption of sugar during a period of distressing shortage has at best slightly diminished . Each American consumes over twice as much as each Englishman and almost four times as much as each Frenchman . Surely it is time to deal more drastically with such anomalies ? with such overwhelming indications of a refusal or inability on the part of the American to abandon under the shock of war the wasteful indulgence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of candies and sweet drinks in the world , and it is this class of consumption which is least necessary and has the smallest food value . Something can be done to diminish the drain made by candy stores and soda water fountains on the sugar supply by an appeal to voluntary effort , but the appeal should be backed up by a power of coercion with which the Food Administration is not now possessed , but which should be granted to it some time in the near future . WT HAT does Senator Reed hope to gain from V V his studied discourtesy to Mr. Hoover ? The committee of which he is a member had elicited from Mr. Spreckels statements that were intended to reflect doubt upon the competence if not the integrity of the service of which Mr. Hoover is the head . Mr. Hoover signified his desire to reply to the implied charges against him , and the American people wanted to hear him . They believe in Mr. Hoover . They do not care especially to have the charges of a disgruntled manufacturer dignified by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoover has to say about the Food Administration . They know that Mr. Hoover is worked nearly to death in bringing something like order out of the chaos of our traditional system of food distribution , and that he ought to be permitted at the earliest possible moment to dispose of this minor vexation . But Senator Reed insists upon hearing all manner of witnesses in whose testimony the public has no interest at all and pushing into the future Hoover 's account of his stewardship . Is it because he hopes that the charges against the Food Administration , however baseless , will in time work their silent effect upon public opinion ? For such pettifogging the coo ' try has no time just now . Doubtless Senator Reed has constituents who delight in every obstacle that can be placed in the way of Mr. Hoover , but It is intolerable that their private spite should be given right of way over the public interest . F ROM the reports of the Congressional inquiries into the services supplying our army , one chat ' acteristic of the bureaucratic mind is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in suP ? plying a material need are technical quality , Price ' and time of delivery , and of these the bureaucratic mind grasps clearly the importance of the first two but troubles little about the third . One gun delivers its missile with a velocity of 2,2 ? feet per second ; another , with a velocity of 210 ? feet . The latter is plainly the better gun , - tech nically . But suppose that it takes six months t ? supply the low-powered gun , a year to supplY high powered one ? Such a consideration the bureaucrat brushes aside . It will be better in the end to have the better gun , he declares . SO ' pose a shipbuilder offers a plan for accelerating construction , at a very material increase in Cc'st : The bureaucrat will think long before he will be cept it . The interests of the Treasury must be protected , he says . Sacrifice quality or econ001110 ' to time ? Why , we have an eternity of time . the battle-front values are quite reversed .

Any ship is cheap that will bring relo , forcements and munitions soon , not late . 133Y4 nets tooled down to within one two-thousandth uti the specification , to be had next year , are elat hopes as compared with any kind of bayonet t co will do execution now .

Might we not wisely send to the fr ? to learn what time means , every man wh ? i9 hold a position of responsibility in supplying equipping our armies ? the gu ABOUT the merits of the Lewisow 1.11 ; de , average American citizen can knt But he knows much about the merits of Coloribr Lewis if he has read the reports of the hearigg fore the Senate Military Affairs Committee December 22nd . One thing the senatorial .10 es .. 0 , tigators were trying to get light on was the e ? lift tive that prompted Colonel Lewis to renonneriot favor of the government his claims to roYaltiii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but on contracts actually awarded and 0 ? ' execution . Why should Colonel Lewis want to Present to the government $2,500,000 that beleuged to him by far clearer title of service than alut sums paid out by the government belong to their claimants ? Especially when the official representatives of the government had met his offers ' f gratuitous services with what looked like calculated scorn ? " Well , " said Colonel Lewis , that is rather a difficult question to answer . I s ' ' PPose it is a psychological affair . " Pressed having by Senator McKellar 's inquiry whether , been an officer of the government , he did not feel that he ought to help the government , ! lurid Lewis replied : " Absolutely . I got my education at government expense . I have been Persecuted the government , and I want to pay t back in good money ? give good money in re- turn for it . But there is a far deeper question . f leave only two sons . Both of them are at the r ? at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e them again and I may not . I am a father as you men here are fathers . You will see your sons .11 a() ever before this trouble is over . We are not sun g the battle of the Allies : we are fighting the battle of the United States . " This explains suffi-e iltlY why Colonel Lewis is not seeking profit , m tnq it explains besides why it is hard to find limits t'ne 's admiration for Colonel Lewis as a man 44c1 a soldier . /IRE prohibition of liquor has a speculative rilea Psychological aspect . Those who favor the 1 , sure on moral grounds are generally satisfied h there is no good reason why men should drink . e3 ' are convinced that if a nation could just " alcohol the whole problem would be llveolently solved . Acceptable as this conclusion may be in an emergency , a number of social psy-Jc ' ? gists are by no means content to quit the subat that point . If men stop taking alcohol , what t , lleY do instead ? We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at saying their prayers , cze then ? China got rid of the opium habit by aheitting the cigarette habit , and the number of theki ) cigarettes now consumed in China exceeds 444 ' 4'ildest estimates . The ingenuity which man tive8 alWays exercised in finding and employing seda- N and stimulants implies that prohibition in- pr ' es more than physiology . To be effective , wition demands at least a new state of mind , before that is achieved men may embark on asPrrments that will make alcohol seem as innocent entmr It would not be at all strange if some psychist tried to prove that the llbs7eviki were being indulged by Russia as a mere the ti:tlite for vodka . By the same token , no doubt , eYstone of German Kultur is beer . Saving Russia N Lloyd George 's speech on war aims of last I week there was one passage to which insufficient attention has been paid . In speaking of the demand which the Allies will make for the " complete restoration of national territory conquered by Germany " he added : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , must alone be responsible for the terms in respect to her own territories . " A policy with respect to Russia is indicated in this passage , which if it is followed by the Allies would taint the treaty of peace with injustice and instability , and which as long as its effects endured would act as a barrier to the formation of a League of Nations . It is the policy of washing their hands of Russia and practically of delivering notice to the German government that so far as the Allies are concerned the principles which they propose to apply to the other territorial questions can be ignored on the Russian front . Russia , that is , will be turned over to Germany , and will have to submit to any terms which the German government may think it expedient to impose . The Russian nation , consequently , would have to choose between the alternatives of becoming the friend , the ally and the accomplice of Germany , or her irreconcilable enemy . In either event a grave and lasting source of insecurity would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allies are , of course , fully justified in paying Russia for deserting the common cause by abandoning the Russian nation to Germany . But this is not either the moment or the occasion for an exhibition even of just resentment or for following a course of behavior , which may be morally justifiable under the old rules , but which may have such disastrous consequences . All the Allied enemies of Germany wish to win the war as victory has been defined by President Wilson . Yet , no matter how much the war is won in other respects , the Allies would forfeit the fruits of victory in case they forced Russia to choose between becoming the special friend or the special enemy of Germany . There can be little doubt how Germany would act under the circumstances . She would seek compensation in Russia for any losses in Africa or the western front or in Middle Europe . There is no sufficient reason for such a counsel of despair . There is still a chance of ultimately saving Russia and keeping her as a part of the anti-German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no graver blunder than to assume that Russia is irredeemably lost . Their failure to understand the New Russia has hitherto been the chief cause of the present crisis . But there is no longer any excuse for misunderstand
