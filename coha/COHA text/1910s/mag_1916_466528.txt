not let your studies interfere with your col-ea Lege education . " This motto adorns the walls of many a student 's room . It is his semi-humorous way of ex-pressing his semi-conviction that studies do not count ? that the thing to go in for is ? " College Life . " This thing , made up of intercollegiate athletics and lesser diversions , is spelled with capitals ? with big capitals in the student 's mind . This frequenter of college walks and halls and tombs and grandstands I call a " student " for want of a safer term , though it sometimes does him injustice . He has sundry answers to the question whether students should study . In academic circles , this is not merely an academic question . The boy who goes to college faces it , in one form or another , again and again . Indeed , before he dons his freshman togs , his father has told him to get an all-round education , and may even have given him to understand that deficiencies in scholarship , which do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he makes the football team . He observes the boys who return from college ; he finds that their language and their clothes bear marks of a higher education . He hears accounts of initiations and celebrations . His chum 's big brother takes him aside and tells him confidentially just how he must conduct himself in order to be rushed for the right fraternity . Everybody tells him he must be a " good fellow " ; few discourse upon the joys of the curriculum . Whether students should study may remain with him an open question , but he begins to doubt whether students do study . ? With his mind set on going to college , he reads all that comes to hand on the VOL . CXXX1II. ? No. 796. - 77subject . The newspapers give him vivid details of the games , big and little , with full-page pictures of the heroes . They report night-shirt parades , student riots , - dances , beer - nights ? anything but studies . Now and - then they do give space to a professor , if he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which everybody in college knows he did not say , or if he is sued for divorce . They even spare him an inch or two if he is awarded a Nobel prize . The lad reads stories of College Life . How they glow with escapades ! His mind becomes a moving-picture of thrilling escapes , of goats enthroned on professorial chairs , of freshies ducked in chilling waters , of battalions of rooters yelling with the precision of a cashregister . Now and then there is mention of lectures and examinations , for it appears that the sophisticated youth knows many devices for . " getting-by " these impediments to the unalloyed enjoyment of College Life . Surely the high-school teacher who spoke with such enthusiasm about the lectures of " Old Socrates " must be hopelessly behind the times . Surely nobody goes to college nowadays for lectures . After entering college the boy continues his studies in the philosophy of education under the tutelage of a sophomore . His tutor informs him that the object of education is the all-round man . The faculty and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper classes rescue the poor freshman from pentagonal and other primitive shapes and round him out with smokers , hazing , initiations , jamborees , and visits to the big city , where he makes the acquaintance of drinks and ladies far more brilliant-hued than those of his somber native town . He is told that he is " seeing life , " and that college will make an all-round man of him yet , if the faculty do not interfere with his education . If this sophomoric philosophy leaves any doubts to puzzle the freshman , they may be cleared away by the alumni who return to warm up the fraternity-house with stories of the good old days . And , of course , the lad joins a fraternity before giving his course of study a thought . For what is college to a non-fraternity man ' Merely an institution of learning . To the man with the Greek-lettered pin the fraternity is the sine qua non . of higher education , the radiant whole of which the college is a convenient part , providing for the fraternity a local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hearth and hears the wisdom of the " Old Grad . " In his day , it seems , things were different . The students were not such mollycoddles , the beer flowed more freely , and the faculty did not try to run things . No , sir , in the good old days the faculty did not spoil College Life . What a glorious celebration after that 56 to o game , when every window in old West Hall was broken and the stoves were thrown down-stairs ! " I tell you , boys , " cries the Old Grad , warming his feet by the fire and his imagination by the wonder of the freshmen , " it is not what you learn in your classes that counts . It is the College Life . Books , lectures , recitations ? you will forget all that . Nobody cares after you graduate whether you know any Latin or algebra , unless you are a teacher , and no man can afford to be a teacher nowadays . But you will remember the College Life as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different story to tell , no doubt , but they do not get back often for fraternity initiations . Perhaps they are too busy . And , again , they may have been nothing but " grinds " during their college days . Whatever we may think of the " Old Grad 's " remarks , the idea does prevail in many a college that the most important enterprises are found in the sideshows , conducted by the students themselves , while the faculty present more or less buncombe performances in the main tent . Woodrow Wilson said something to this effect before he gave up trying to make boys take their studies seriously in favor of the comparatively easy job he now holds . Professor Churchman of Clark College declares that success in athletics and the social life of the college " seems to be the honest ambition of an appalling proportion of fathers and mothers who are sending their sons to fashionable colleges , in the same spirit that accompanies their daughters to fashionable finishing schools . " One father whose son triumphed on the gridiron and failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " My son 's life has been just what I wanted it to be . " In 1903 , a committee of the Harvard faculty , after extensive investigation , found that the average amount of study was " discreditably small . " The committee declared that there was " too much teaching and not enough study , " and that ambitious students find little incentive to take honors . The following year another committee reported that the student body did not regard grades in college courses as any test of ability . In 1908 , a committee , of which President Lowell was chairman , came to this conclusion : " Contentment with mediocrity is perhaps the greatest danger that faces us , and it is closely connected with the feeling among the students that college is a sort of interlude in serious life , separated from what goes before and dissociated from what follows . " A large majority of seniors at Harvard expressed this belief in response to a questionnaire , and students elsewhere have expressed the conviction in a score of ways . Many students look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College Life , tolerated for a time in order that the abode may be free to welcome its convivial guests . They regard the social light of the fraternity and the hero of the gridiron as the most promising candidates for success in life . The valedictorian appears to them too confined in his interests to meet successfully anything beyond the artificial tasks of the class-room . Ile ? poor fellow ? is supposed to be doomed to failure in real life . Wherefore the respectability of " The Gentleman 's Grade " ? the sign of mediocrity in scholarship . Wherefore the epithet " grind , " with its superlative " greasy grind , " which sums up the contempt of the " good fellow " for the man who makes hard study his chief collegiate interest . In many a student group the boy who thus speeds up and passes his fellows is treated as a " scab . " And in many a faculty group the idea seems to be : ' T is better to have come and loafed Than never to have come at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seed spreads even to the virgin soil of the kindergarten . The new tree of life the painless educa-tion , by the do-what-you-please , whenyou-please , how-you-please method ? is said to have been imported from Italy . But its foliage is much like our native stock of the American college variety . Even upon the correspondence schools are grafted some branches of the tree of College Life . It is said that a father in Hood River , Oregon , found his son standing on his head in the crotch of an apple-tree , waving his legs in the air and giving a college yell . " Come down , boy , " he cried . " Are you crazy ? " " No , father ; leave me alone , " said he . " I have just started my correspondence-school course , and the sophomores have written , me to go and haze myself . " On the other hand , President Hyde voiced the common idea of college teachers when he said , in an address to freshmen : " Put your studies first ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better time in college . Hard work is a necessary background for the enjoyment of everything else . Second , after the first three months you will stand better with your fellows . At first there will appear to be cheaper roads is dis-tinction , but their cheapness s soon found out . Scholarship alone will not give you the highest standing with your fellows ; but you will not get their highest respect without showing that you i can do well something that is ntellectu-ally difficult . Third , your future career depends upon it . " But does your future career really depend upon it ? That question may wellbe answered by college faculties with something more than their opinions . On this subject teachers are regarded as prejudiced authorities . They are supposed to believe in the importance of their own tubs . They may exhort students to study on the ground that success in undergraduate studentship leads to the kind of achievement that men desire in the life beyond commencement . But boys think they know better . I know that this is so , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the University of Maine in the northeast to the University of Redlands in the southwest . I have learned what I could from the oldest university at Cambridge , Massachusetts , and from the youngest at Houston , Texas . I have sought out these institutions along twenty-five thousand miles of travel . I have tried to determine , from what students say and do the country over , to what extent they deem study worth the effort . There are differences , to be sure . The idea that College Life in " caps " should be the text , with studies as a footnote , has not gripped all institutions with the same force . In some , the idea seems to be a settled conviction ; in others , little more than a suspicion . Colleges can not be readily classified on the basis of the earnestness of purpose with which students greet the curriculum . It does nor appear that state universities stand higher or lower in this regard than privately supported institutions . Nor are there class distinctions of this kind between small and large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between uni-versities with millions of endowment and those endowed with poverty and hopes . There appears to be a difference between schools of the East and schools of the West ; but other generalizations , though frequently made by overzealous friends of particular schools , appear to be based on too few cases . I am speaking , always , of the central tendencies of groups ? of the mode , as sociologists would say , and not of the few extreme eases in the surface of distribution . Nearly every college has its distinctive feature , which balks classification . One might conclude , From the studiousness of the boys at the College of the City of New York , that large , free , urban universities are the usual resorts of serious-minded youth . Such a conclusion would ignore the racial factor more important in this instance than any other . The intellectual achievements of older graduates of Williams and Bowdoin and Amherst appear to make out a strong case for the small , sectarian , New England country college . But a generation or two ago there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not available sufficient to prove that the recent graduates of the small , country colleges have finer intellectual enthusiasms than the recent graduates of any other group of colleges . Conclusions based on the spirit of a generation ago are usually misleading as present-day guides . Such conclusions may or may not be misleading in this case . American colleges changed vitally during the past generation , and a few are changing rapidly to-day . With these qualifications , I venture one generalization : students of - the younger Western colleges are more worthy of the name than those of the older Eastern colleges . They come through greater sacrifices and with more serious purposes . This is what history tells us to expect of the frontier . It is , moreover , the usual report of those who have taught in the East and in the West . Eagerness for knowledge is one manifestation of the enthusiasm of youth in a young country . In many of the older seats of learning , responsiveness to the efforts of instructors is in had form . To do more than the assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help , is to risk one 's reputation . " Harvard indifference " is not Harvard indifference ; it is the attitude toward studies of young men anywhere who go to college as a matter of course , with no dominant purpose beyond the desire to enjoy College Life . They find that there is little in it ; even their interest in intercollegiate athletics has to be coaxed by rallies and organized into cheers . They find out that a man who has nothing to do but amuse himself has a hard job . Spontaneous delight over anything is not to be expected . To increase in years and in resources and yet retain the splendid enthusiasms of poverty and youth appears to be as difficult for institutions as for men and women . Yet so rapidly are colleges changing that conditions seem to pass away under our very scrutiny . The West of to-day is a new West . Even the far West is a-ready a long generation beyond frontier days . The colleges are keeping pace with the country , not only in material prosperity , but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion of the families are well-to-do , and a larger proportion of boys and girls resort to higher schools . Growth begets the desire to grow . Numbers seem necessary for winning games and impressing legislatures . College expenses grow , too . Easier communication with Eastern universities leads to further imitation . Thus sturdy Western institutions of pioneer days tend to lose their individuality . They reveal signs of what they call progress . They not only standardize their units of admission , but also their ideals . They tend to become intellectual democracies and social aristocracies ; in the beginning they were quite the reverse . The change has not gone so far in the West ? certainly not in the private colleges of the West ? but the direction is unmistakable . Again , let me say , 1 speak in terms of group tendencies ; exceptions leap to mind with every statement . Is high scholarship worth the effort ? In other words , have colleges devised courses of study which bear any relation to the probable careers of their students ? Is there any evidence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve success after graduation than a man who is content with passing marks ? If there is any such connection between success in studies and success in life , it should be possible to measure it by approved statistical methods , and thus arrive at conclusions of more value as guidance to the undergraduate than the opinion of any man . Both the professor and the sport arc in danger of arguing from exceptional instances ? each is likely to find striking cases in proof of his preconceived notions ; each is inclined to scorn the opinion of the other . But conclusions drawn from large numbers of cases , not subject to invalidating processes of selection , and employing terms that are adequately defined for the purpose at hand , must command the respect of all men . If such conclusions do not support the contention that it pays to study , there is something radically wrong with the professor 's part of college affairs ; different kinds of achievement should receive academic distinction and new tests should be devised . If , on the other hand , present standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of accuracy , the facts should be discovered and used everywhere to combat the prevalent undergraduate opinion . Whatever the outcome of such studies , we should have them in larger numbers , in many places , protected by every safeguard of scientific method . We may well ask , first , whether promise in the studies of one period becomes performance in the studies of a later period . Are good students in high-school more likely than others to become good students in college ? Prof. Walter F. Dearborn tried to answer that question for the State of Wisconsin . lie compared the records of hundreds of students at the University of Wisconsin with their records in various high-schools . He found that above eighty per cent . of those who were in the first quarter of their high-school classes remained in the upper half of their classes throughout the four years of their university course , and that above eighty per cent . of those who were in the lowest quarter in their high-school classes failed to rise above the line of mediocre scholarship in the university . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , except in scattering cases , promise in the high-school becomes performance in the college . Indeed , only one student out of nearly five hundred in this investigation who fell among the lowest quarter in the high-school attained the highest rank in the university . Of course , a boy may loaf in high-school and take his chance of being the one exception among five hundred . But he would hardly be taking a sporting chance ; it would be rather a fool 's chance . The risk would be less in going over Niagara Falls in a barrel . The University of Chicago found that high-school students who failed to attain an average rank higher than the passing mark , by at least twenty-five per cent . of the difference between that passing mark and one hundred , failed in their college classes . The faculty therefore decided not to admit such students . Exceptions were made of the most meritorious cases , but few of these exceptions made satisfactory records in the college . Basing its policy upon such evidence as this , Reed College , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit , as a rule , only students who ranked in the first third of their preparatory-school classes . Some exceptions have been made . Twenty per cent . of those admitted were known to he below the first third , and two per cent . below the median line . In all cases these candidates were regarded as the most promising of those who fell below the first third in high-school rank , yet almost without exception they have failed to rise above the lowest quarter of their college classes . Thus , it appears that in Oregon , as in Wisconsin and Illinois , those who get the best start in the lower schools maintain their advantage in the upper schools ; few of their classmates overtake them . But why strive for high rank in college ? Why not wait for the more " practical " studies of the professional school ? Hundreds of boys the country over declare to-day that it makes little difference whether they win high grades or merely passable grades in the liberal arts , since these courses have no definite bearing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit that they must settle down to serious effort in the studies of law , medicine , engineering that is to say , in professional schools . Even the sport who makes the grade of mediocrity his highest aim as a college undergraduate , fully intends to strive for high scholarship in his professional studies . Does he often attain that aim ? That is the question . And that , fortunately , is a question we may answer with more than opinions . We may take , for example , all the students who graduated from Harvard College during a period of twelve years and entered the Harvard Medical School . Of the 239 who received no distinction as undergraduates , 36 per cent . graduated with honor from the Medical School , Of the 4r who received degrees of A.B . with high honor , more than 92 per cent . took their medical degrees with honor . Still more conclusive are the records of the graduates of Harvard College who during a period of twenty years entered the Harvard Law School . Of those who graduated from college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attained distinction in the Law School . Of those who graduated with honor from the college , 22 per cent . attained distinction in the Law School ; of those who graduated with great honor , 4o per cent. ; and of those who graduated with highest honor , 6o per cent . Sixty per cent ! Bear that figure in mind a moment , while we consider the 34o who entered college " with conditions " ? that is to say , without having passed all their entrance examinations ? and graduated from college with plain degrees . Of these men , not 3 per cent . won honor degrees in law . If a college undergraduate is ready to he honest with himself , he must say , " If I am content with mediocre work in college , it is likely that the men in my class who graduate with honor will have three times my chances of success in the Law School , and the men who graduate in my class with highest honor will have nearly ten times my chalices of success . " So difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life after the crucial years of college that not one man in twenty years ? not one man in twenty years ? who was satisfied in Harvard College with grades of " C " and lower gained distinction in the studies of the Harvard Law School . The same relation appears to persist between the promise of Yale undergraduates and their performance in the Harvard Law School . If we divide the 250 graduates of Yale who received their degrees in law at Cambridge between 19oo and 1915 into nine groups , according to undergraduate scholarship , beginning with those who won the highest " Senior Appointments " at Yale and ending with those who received no graduation honors , we find that the first group did the best work in their studies of law , the second group next , the third group next , and so on , in the same order , with but a single exception , to the bottom of the list . The performance at Harvard of each of the eight groups of Yale honor graduates was in precise accordance with the promise of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in college , the spurt who does not let his studies interfere with his education , but who intends to settle down to hard work later on , and who later on actually does completely change his habits of life , is almost a myth . At least his record does not appear among those of thousands of students whose careers have been investigated under the direction of President Lowell and others . It seems that results are legal tender , but you can not cash in good intentions . " Dignified credit to all , " cries the billboard . " Enjoy your new suit now , and pay for it later . ' Many a boy , lured by the instalment plan , expects to get an education on deferred payments in effort , only to find that there is no credit for him , dignified or otherwise . What his honest effort has paid for in full is his to-day ; nothing more by any chance whatever . But why strive for the highest standing in professional school ? Ler us pursue the inquiry one step further . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success in life . As Far as the study of law is concerned , we may answer at once that the known success of the honor graduates of the Harvard Law School is one reason why even college undergraduates at Cambridge believe that law students should study law ? hard and seriously . For the same reason , leading law-offices the country over give preference to honor graduates of law-schools . But what is success in life ? That is the first problem . It is one difficulty that confronts every one who attempts to speak with certainty about the meaning of education . There is no accepted definition of the aim of education . The philosopher has been likened to a blind man in a dark cellar hunting for a black cat that is n't there . The aim of education seems as elusive as the proverbial black cat . Nevertheless , we do not close our schools . We strive . for con-crete ends , such as proficiency-in handwriting , aware that any particular end may soon be regarded as not worth the effort to attain it . Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proficiency in handwriting , for we had not attempted to define our aim or devise a measure of our progress toward it . We still speak of educational processes and results about as accurately as the Indians spoke of temperature . We still speak of the science of education without seeming to understand that there is no science without precise measurement . From our fragmentary beginnings to an adequate science of education is a long journey , and the road is beset with difficulties . While we struggle along this road , generations will come and go . We will help them to attain what seem , for the time , the proper aims of education . A use his own definition of success , but I asked them not to select men whose achievements appeared to he due principally to family wealth or position . The judges agreed in naming twenty-three successful men . I then had the entire undergraduaterecords of these men accurately copied from the college records and compared with the standing of twenty-three men chosen at random from the same class . The result was striking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attained in their college studies nearly four times as many highest grades as the random selection . To the credit of the successful men are 196 " A 's " ; to the credit of the other men , only 56 . Following a similar plan , three judges selected the most successful men among the graduates of the first twenty-four ( 1878-5901 ) classes from the University of Oregon . An examination of the scholarship records of these men showed that 53 per cent . had been good students and 57 per cent . had been weak students . Of the graduates who were not regarded as successful , 52 per cent . had been weak students and only 12 per cent . had been good students . Similar results have been found by Prof. A. A. Potter , Dean of the Kansas State Agricultural College . in an unpublished study of the relationship between superiority in undergraduate scholarship and success in the practice of engineering as indicated by salaries received . The Director of the School of Forestry of Yale University has collected evidence of the same kind in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Forestry . It appears that about ninety per cent . of the men who have had conspicuous success in the field of forestry were among the better students in their professional studies . President Thwing of Western Reserve University , thehistorian of higher education in America , says that he has found no exception , in the records of any American college , to the general rule that those who achieve most before graduation are likely to achieve most after graduation . The list of the first ten scholars of each of the classes that graduated from Harvard College in the sixth decade of the last century , as presented by William Roscoe Thayer , is a list of men eminent in every walk of life . Indeed , it is likely that the first quarter in scholarship of any school or college class will give to the world as many distinguished men as the other three-quarters . What can we say in this connection of the 420 living graduates of the ten Wesleyan University classes from 1890 to 1899 ? Just this : Of the men in that group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now regarded as distinguished either by Who ' . r Who in America or by the judgment of their classmates ; of those who were elected to Phi Beta Kappa ? the scholarship honor society ? 3o per cent. ; of those who won no superior honors in scholarship , only II per cent . Of the men now living who graduated from Wesleyan University between 186o and 1889 , i6 per cent . are listed in Who 's Who ; of those who received high honors in scholarship during this period , so per cent. ; of those who attained no distinction as scholars , only to per cent . From the records of 1,667 graduates of Wesleyan University , Professor Nicholson concludes that of the highesthonor graduates ( the two or three leading scholars of each class ) one out of two will become distinguished ; of Phi Beta Kappa men , one out of three ; of the rest , one out of ten . Concerning the value of Who 's Who as a criterion of success in life , we may say at least this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motives , to include the men and women who have achieved most worthy leadership in all reputable walks of life . Whatever flaws it may have , it is acknowledged to be the best list of names for such uses as we are now making of it ? and such changes in the list as any group of competent judges might make would not materially affect the general conclusions we have drawn . Further proof of the relation between scholarship and success in life was found by Prof. E. G. Dexter . He compared the records , before and after graduation , of the men of twenty-two colleges . Of all the living graduates of these colleges , he found about 2 per cent . in Who 's Who ; of the honor scholars , he found 5.9 per cent . It thus appears that the chances of this kind of success in life of a good student are about three times the chances of students selected at random . Looking at the records in still another way , we may observe that about 15 per cent . of all graduates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has nothing to do with success in life , we should expect to find that 15 per cent . of the graduates in Who 's Who were Phi Beta Kappa men . But they surpass this expectancy by nearly 100 per cent . In even larger measure have the very highest scholars fulfilled the promise of their college years . Of the Yale valedictorians , 56 per cent . are included in Who 's Who . That is to say , a man at the head of his class appears to have more than twenty-five times as many chances of distinction as the man selected at random from among his classmates . Again , of the 13,705 living alumni of two of the larger New England colleges , 5.4 per cent . of those who graduated in the first tenth of their classes are included in Who 's Who , and only i.8 per cent . of those who graduated in the fourth tenth . With due allowance for the defects of the measures of success here employed , the figures tend strongly to corroborate the conclusions of all other studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education is the safest single measure of the success he is likely to achieve in later life . It seems that men do not differ much below the shoulders ; with that part of their anatomy they gain about the same wages per day in the unsentimental world of business ; what they become from the shoulders up makes the difference . It is well known that the universities of England and the English people generally have much more respect for scholarship than is common in the United States . One reason is doubtless the eminence for centuries in the Old World of leading university scholars . Of the 384 Oxford University men called to the bar before 1865 , 46 per cent . of those who received first-class honors at Oxford subsequently attained distinction in the practice of law , as indicated by the offices they held . Of the men who were content with pass degrees , only i6 per cent . attained distinction . The list follows : Of the 92 who received first-class honors , 46 per cent . attained distinction Of the 85 who received second-class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 67 who received third-class honors , 22 per cent . attained distinction . Of the 61 who received fourth-class honors , ao per cent . attained distinction . Of the 271 who received pass-degree honors , 16 per cent . attained distinction . Of the 58 who received no degrees , Is per cent . attained distinction . No student who fell below the second group of scholars at Oxford attained a. political distinction of the highest class . A similar correlation is found between the degree of success of undergraduates at Oxford and their subsequent distinction as clergymen . Of the first-class men , 68 per cent . attained distinction . Of the second-class men , 37 per cent . attained distinction . Of the third-class men , 32 per cent . attained distinction . Of the fourth-class men , zg per cent . attained distinction . Of the pass-degree men , 21 per cent . attained distinction . Of the no-degree men , 9 per cent . attained distinction .

A knowledge of all these facts will hardly make thinking as popular as a motion-picture show , but it ought to silence some of those who seek to excuse their mental sloth on the ground that it does n't matter . There is another group of students to whom we should here pay our respects those who drop out before graduation . The Commencement programme is not as respectful to them as the newspaper account of a horse-race ; it does not even mention the fact that they " also 796. - 78ran . " Yet many of them assure us that they could do well in their studies if they cared to take the trouble . What shall we say to them ? Chiefly this : that not caring to take the trouble " is itself an alarming symptom . Ability without the disposition to use it is like gasolene without a spark . It wins no races . Dropping out of college not only implies a predisposition to drop out of every race before the finish , but as well a smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-five years after graduation , only is per cent . of those who had graduated were dead , and 32 per cent . of those who dropped out before graduating . It is true that some colleges are so loosely put together that a student can loaf until the last week of the term and then scrape through by a kind of deathbed repentance . Not so in the severer trials of life beyond the campus . " In the moral world , " as Charles R. Brown puts it , " a man is judged not by the few holy emotions he can scramble together in the last fifteen minutes of earthly existence : he is judged by the whole trend and drift of his life . " And this is just . What a man is content to be , day after day , when all runs smoothly . that , in all probability , he will find himself to be when a crisis comes . In much that I have said about success I have used the mathematical term " chance , " a term as far removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck . If all these studies prove anything , they prove that there is a long chain of causal connections binding together the achievements of a man 's life and explaining the success of a given moment . That is the non-skid chain that keeps him safe in slippery places . Luck is about as likely to strike a man as lightning , and about as likely to do him any good . The best luck a young man can have is the firm conviction that there is no such thing as luck , and that he will gain in life just about w hat he deserves , and no more . The man who is waking around for something lucky to turn up has time to see a preparedness parade pass by him ? the procession of those who have formed the habit of turning things up . In a saloon at a prairie station in Montana I saw the sign , " Luck beats science every time . " That is the motto of the gambler and of every other fool .

The undergraduate who is really eager to excel in any life-work , and who is brave enough to face the facts , will take down that sign from the walls of his room , " Do not let your studies interfere with your college education , " and replace it with this one " Do not let your College Life interfere with your life 's ambition . " The boy without ambition will take for his motto , " Let well enough alone , " oblivious to the fact that people who are content to let well enough alone rarely do well enough . At a convention of teachers not long ago , a speaker ridiculed a German boy who , upon failing in a recitation , put his head upon his desk and cried . He said he had never seen such a boy in the schools of this country . He might have added that we do have in this country the spectacle of boys , grown almost to manhood , coming off the gridiron crying because they have lost a game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose the better time , for nothing seems to promise failure in the tasks of to-morrow with greater certainty than failure in the studies of today , whereas the most passionate champions of intercollegiate athletics have never presented evidence of correlation between winning games in college and winning success in life . As I look back over all my schooldays , I think with deep gratitude of the oldest master in the public schools of Boston , whose motto was , " One hundred per cent . or zero . " Nothing short of perfection satisfied him . We all knew it , and day after day we toed the mark . A boy came home from school the other day and said to his father , " I got one hundred per cent in school to-day . " " Did you ? " exclaimed the proud father . " In what subject ? " " Oh , I got fifty per cent . in arithmetic and fifty per cent . in geography . " What that kind of one hundred per cent . promises for the future can be predicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said a senior in his Commencement part , " is a man greatly beloved by his students ? after they graduate . " A wise teacher knows that he can afford to wait many years for the verdicts of his students ; a wise student knows that he can not afford to wait ; he must choose the hardest taskmasters now . Among teachers the greatest number of criminals are not those who kill their young charges with overwork , but those who allow them to form the habit of being satisfied with less than the very best there is in them . Ruskin had no patience with people who talk about " the thoughtlessness of youth " indulgently . " I had infinitely rather hear of thoughtless old age , " he declared , " and the indulgence due to that . When a man has done his work , and nothing can any way be materially altered in his fate , let him forget his toil , and jest with his fate , if he will ; but what excuse can you find for wilfulness of thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangs on your decisions ? A youth thoughtless ! when all the happiness of his home forever depends on the chances or the passions of an hour ! A youth thoughtless ! when the career of all his days depends on the opportunity of a moment . A youth thoughtless ! when his every act is a foundation stone of future conduct , and every imagination a fountain of life or death ! Be thoughtless in any afteryears. rather than now . " Now let the student profit by the experiences of the thousands who have gone before and greet his next task with the words of Hotspur before the battle of Shrewsbury : Oh , gentlemen , the time of life is short ; To spend that shortness basely were too long , If life did ride upon a dial 's point , Still ending at the arrival of an hour .
