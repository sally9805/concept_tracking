The Poetry of Robert Frost Mountain Interval , by Robert Frost . New York : Henry Holt &; Co. $1.25 . T HE poetry of American local life , after having been hinted at for long , made a significant appearance last year not from one , but from two quarters ? from the Illinois of Edgar Lee Masters and the New England of Robert Frost . The New England book had less of a shudder , and it shows a readiness of response on the part of the public here that , with the grave and , as one might say , featureless poems in it , it had a success equal to " The Spoon River Anthology , " in which , besides the poetic and dramatic appeal , there was the interest of exciting fiction . To go from " The Spoon River Anthology " to " North of Boston " is to go from the court-house into the fields . The fields are usual , and , as we have been in an unusual place , we are not at first impressed . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounding hill , the frame-house have each a character of their own . We notice that the people ? a few of them at all events ? have the inaccessible life that Burns 's and Wordsworth 's people have . Such a life belongs to the woman in " A Servant to Servants . " Such a life , too , belongs to the man in " The S el f-seeker . " Unlike Mr. Masters , Mr. Frost seems to have no notion of satire or of social judgment . This is a terrible background to " A Servant to Servants . " A bride has been brought into a house where her husband 's mad brother lives as in a den and delights himself by yelling out filthy things in the night . Mr. Masters would have left a social judgment to be inscribed on a tombstone . But Mr. Frost 's spirit goes into the current of a life that still moves on . And as that life expresses itself we feel only sympathy with a soul that does not judge and which is beyond our judgments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student and a lover of wild flowers . His legs have been crushed in a mill , and he can never again search out the flowers he loves so well . He takes five hundred dollars ' compensation . There is no satire here . Mr. Frost lets us see the reachings and the reserves of a soul , and he lets us know besides the forms and the hiding places of the wild flowers . Though there were few people in " North of Boston " and though these people knew of few events , still the book gave the sense of a community . And the brooding of the poet gave life to the inanimate things around . We were made remember the unlived-in Black Cottage and the wood-pile that warms " the frozen swamp as best it could with the slow , smokeless burning of decay " ? we were made remember the wall that has some undiscovered enemy ; the mountain that crushes the life of the village ; the thousands and tens of thousands of gathered apples . In " North of Boston " Mr. Frost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men and women , but in the hint // of mystery that he gave ? in the atmosphere that he made surround the inanimate thing ? " something there is that does not love a wall " he says , and , as he plods and labors after the explanation we begin to have glimpses and revelations . His very slowness and laboriousness give a hint of this earthy mystery : " Something there is that does not love a wall , And sends the frozen ground-swell under it , And spills the upper boulders in the sun ; And makes gaps even two can pass abreast . The work of hunters is another thing ; I have come after them and made repair Where they have left not one stone on a stone , But they would have the rabbit out of hiding , To please the yelping dogs . The gaps I mean No one has seen them made or heard them made , But at spring mending time we find them there . " He has made a certain featureless blank verse his own . Using it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eloquence in their natures , have a speech that sometimes lifts into beauty and tragic eloquence . " I can repeat the very words you were saying , " cries the mother in " Home Burial " to her husband who has buried their child cal-lously : " I can repeat the very words you were saying . ' Three foggy mornings and one rainy day Will rot the best birch fence a man can build . ' Think of it , talk like that at such a time ! What had how long it takes a birch to rot To do with what was in the darkened parlor . You could n't care ! The nearest friends can go With any one to death , comes so far short They might as well not try to go at all . No , from the time when one is sick to death , One is alone , and he dies more alone . Friends make pretense of following to the grave , But before one is in it , their minds arc turned And making the best of their way back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Frost 's recent volume , " Mountain Interval , " has more of the personal , less of the communal life . Only in a few poems does he give us those detached dramatic pieces that made the bulk of " North of Boston . " The sense of personal life comes from the sonnets and from the dramatic sequence that he calls " The Hill Wife . " In these few dramatic lyrics there is a poetic grace that his featureless blank verse did not reveal . The poem before the last one in the sequence , " The Oft-repeated Dream " has what is rare in American poetry ? the mystery-suggesting phrase : " She had no saying dark enough For the dark pine that kept Forever trying the window-latch Of the room where they slept . The tireless but ineffectual hands That with every futile pass Made the great tree seem as a little bird Before the mystery of glass . It never had been inside the room And only one of the two Was afraid in an oft-repeated dream Of what the tree might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
