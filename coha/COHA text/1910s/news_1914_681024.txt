txt His Majesty , King George V. of England , witnessed a real , close ' , eleven-Inning , baseball game to-day between our Giants and the White Sox , The only word of regret I have to tell the fans in the United States is that the White Sox defeated us by the score of 5 to 4 . There never was a game played with more determination and enthusiasm . Every player on both teamswanted Ito show the King and his people that Ilbaseball was a gripping , nerve tingling sport . In the exhibition to-day I believe we accomplished our purpose . I have never seen players try . so hard to win as the boys on both of the teams did to-day . It will be hard for our fans to realize , but imagine if you can , an enthusiasm and interest in a foreign aggregation which would attract more than 30,000 people to the Chelsea Football Grounds to-day . To me it was a flattering recognition of our great American game . Cheers for the King . When King George entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiger for His Majesty . We grouped ourselves in front of , the royal boa , and the-tusullt and-.the- - shontIng dently pleased ale I iisg slid his party , because they bowed their acknowledgment to our boisterous reception . A great shout went up from the populace as King George entered the grounds . It was the first time the king had visited these grounds , and when he was seated in the royal box our players lined lie and Mr. Comiskey , Mr. Farrell , and myself told the royal party in our own way how pleased we were to have them present to see the game . We were all presented to King George by Walter Hines Page , the American Ambassador . King George said : " I am very glad to have you gentlemen here with Your baseball teams . " I expressed our appreciation in behalf of the players , and we all shook hands with his Majesty . King George then took a. baseball which had been given to him and he tossed it to Jimmy Callahan who Passed it on the Umpire Bill Klein. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the pitcher . So the first ball was really an unusual play in baseball , King George to Callahan to Klem to Scott . The national game will never know of a greater play than that . The ball which the King tossed out was then presented to Mr. Comiskey , who will keep it as a souvenir . Contrary to custom Mr. Callahan andMyself did not wear ? uniforms ; but with the ladles of the party we occupied . an especially constructed box near the royal box and with Mr. and Mrs. Comiskey we remained there during the exciting eleven innings . Ire had a great time coming to the field . The players put on their uniforms at the hotel and then went to the Chelsea grounds in automobiles . On the hood of each car was a silk American flag . We were surrounded by mounted and unmounted policemen and the admiring crowds were kept at a distance , but if it had not been for this protection We would never have been able to reach the grounds on account of the immense crowd . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party were greatly pleased with the brisk actions of the players in the " warming up " practice . Each fast play was greeted with cheers . Evidently the British were surprised at the fast playing of our athletes . After we had been presented to his Majesty ' the game started . It did n't take the Britons very long to get the idea of the game and they followed each inning with close interest . The rooting and yelling of the crowd was a great surprise to us , because after a few innings had been played they seemed to get the drift of the game and cheered every good play . The players went into this contest with heart and soul , and I have never seen teams try harder to win . If the King had been at the Polo Grounds at a game which would decide the world 's series he could not have witnessed a harder played battle than the clash to-day . King " George stayed to . - the finish Continnedan Page L. 130,000 BRITONS SEE APIERICANB-ASEBALL // and was as much interested as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the home fans and made ue feel natural in this foreign clime . The King seemed to enjoy every situation and laughed when the policeman had to field the-foul balls . The game was close , and for two innings not a run was scored . In the third the Sox put fwo runs across , and in the next in , ning we tied the count when Hans Lobert slammed out e. home run , sending Magee home ahead of him . The Giants scored two more runs in the tenth , and then the Sox , tied the score when " Wahoo Sam " Crawford batted out a home run scoring Buck Weaver . It was in the eleventh inning that King George got his first real baseball thrill . With the score tied and the last half of the eleventh inning being played , Tommy Daly , one of Ithe White Son recruit players , came to bat . The situation was intense . Faber , pitching for the Giants , sped over his fastest curves . The British populace howled with delight as Daly missed the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact he hit the ball , and the white pill sailed to left field far and high andl was lost in the cheering crowd as Daly romped home with the White Sox victory . King George was elated and so was everybody else , and if I must say so it was as exciting as any game I have ever witnessed . Xing George Knew Game . Too much credit can not be given to young Faber . About midway in the j game the White Sox crowded the lbases . With three men on and only one man out Faber faced a crisis . He measured up to the situation , and with King George applauding and the 30,000 fans yelling like mad this young boxman retired the side without allowing a run to score . It was the young , ster 's day of triumph , and I 'll bet ' he will remember it until the last day he lives . The thrill of the situation caught everybody in that vast multitude , and then they understood why we Americans enthuse over our national game . Ambassador Page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explaining to do after the first few innings . The King knew just virhat was going on and needed no coaching . The runs for the Giants were scored by Donlin . Magee , ( 2 ) . and Lobert , and for the White Sox by Weaver , Crawford , Date ( 2 , ) and Bliss . We were greeted with cheers as we left the grounds . The Americans in the crowd Were greatly pleased at the wonderfully fast stork of both clubs . After the game Ambassador Page said that this game was the greatest event that America had ever shown England . Mr , Fowler of the American Embassy came to us after the game , saying that he was sent by his Majesty to tell Mr. Comiskey and myself that he was delighted with the game , and Mr. Page also was highly pleased . To us it Was a grand culmination of this great world 's tour , and we all feel more than pleased that the English people enjoyed our game in the magnificent way in which they did . We all regret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so dear by association to many of our hearts . We hope we will have another opportunity to visit the Emerald Isle , but it is imperative that we take the Lush tania for home on Saturday .
