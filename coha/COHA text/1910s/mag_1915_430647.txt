 | THE woman suffrage amendments which will soon be voted on in New York , Pennsylvania , Massachusetts and New Jersey bring two questions prominently to the front . 1 . For what reasons was the vote extended to the men of this country ? 2 . Do those reasons apply to women ? Governments have been instituted among men to serve the common welfare of the people . It follows therefore that he who pays a tax to support that welfare is given a ballot 's share in the disbursement of the money he pays , and he who obeys the laws which regulate that welfare is given a ballot 's share in the making of those laws . For these reasons and for no other the vote has been given to men . These reasons assuredly apply to women . They are not only taxpayers but they pay enormous taxes . They are also affected as closely as men by the nature of the government under which they live . No one will deny these facts . The opponents of woman suffrage for three generations have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have attempted to discover some cause which would place them outside the pale of these reasons . They have so far failed that constitutions have been amended in eleven states to grant complete suffrage to women . In Illinois the municipal and presidential franchise has been conferred , and full suffrage in Alaska . Suffragists hold that they have a demonstration complete and overwhelming in behalf of their cause in the following facts : Woman suffrage has spread from state to neighboring state where people know best what woman suffrage means . No anti-suffrage movement exists in any suffrage state . No person who advocated the enfranchisement of women before its adoption has changed his mind , while the number of those who did oppose it and who are now enthusiastic supporters is legion . Yet despite logic that no one attempts to deny , and the practically unanimous approval of the great West , a struggle to obtain woman suffrage is now in progress in four states of the East which finds no equal in world campaigns . In the center of the stage where the limelight is most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who to the superficial observer seem to be the chief opponents . These women have two lines of appeal . They eloquently plead : " Do not thrust the ballot upon us ; we do not want it , " and there are those who believe this to be a valid excuse for withholding it from the entire sex . There are two classes of men who vote in the United States ; those who have been born here and those who have been naturalized here . Is any boy of twenty-one or any man who steps forth from a naturalization court ever asked whether he wants to vote ? Has the vote been given to any man because he wanted it ? Never . The vote is given to use or not to use as the individual chooses . It is permissive , never compulsory . It can be no burden to those to whom it is extended , for such persons as possess no patriotic desire to serve in this manner the country under which they live are free to remain away from the ballot box . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world not to trust their sex . Men were a thousand years in reaching the ballot . The cause of delay was on the one hand the distrust which governing classes had of those whom they governed and on the other the distrust which the disfranchised men had of members of their own class . So it is not strange perhaps that women plead with men not to trust women . Anti-suffragists appeal to the distrust which those who govern have always shown to the governed and try to strengthen it . It is their claim that women are so lacking in patriotism that they do not want to vote and will not vote when the opportunity is given . They claim that women care so little for the moral development of society that they will not trouble to vote even for good causes . It is their plea that women are so deficient in intelligent understanding of public measures that their votes will weaken any government which admits them . As men have ever been their own worst enemies , so women have been a potent power to retard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as men who were scandalized at the idea of taxing the public to maintain public schools for the education of " shes . " It was women who regarded the high school , the college and the university education as indelicate for women . It was women who refused to speak to Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell , the first woman physician . It was women who cried " shame " at Susan B. Anthony when she arose to address a teachers ' convention in the State of New York . It was women who cried " served them right " when several of the leading newspapers of this country editorially stigmatized the first women who attempted to speak in public as " she hyenas . " It was wives , when the first petition to the legislature for property rights for women was circulated , who refused to sign it upon the ground that the control of property was the just privilege of husbands . Yet , tho women opposed each step of the progress of their sex in turn , they have not failed to avail themselves of every privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman would now claim that the gain of any of them was a mistake . So it happens that in the year 1915 all women have practically complete emancipation from the old traditions and occupy their present advanced position because some women were willing to demand each right when all the world was against them and to stand by that demand until the world caught up with them . The same type of women who opposed education , property rights , public speech , organization , accept all the privileges won for them by the struggle of other women and from that position of vantage turn to oppose as best they can the logical , inevitable next step in the evolution of women . The number of women who are demanding the vote grows enormously year by year . I can not speak with authority as to the number of the disfranchised women in the United States who want to vote , but in the State of New York , where I am familiar with conditions and can so speak , 1,000,000 women ? a big majority of those who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The handwriting on the wall of human destiny announces the inevitable coming of woman suffrage . All signs point in that direction and none points the other way .
