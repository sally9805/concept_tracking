txt Withdrawal from the League . There seems to be one important provision lacking in the League of Nations in itw present form and that is a provision for withdrawal or denunciation . It is a rule of international law which no nation would care to dispute that treaties can not be made between States to bind the parties in perpetuity and that they are all terminable or denounceable on reasonable notice . But what may be reasonable notice will vary with each case and the conception of what Is reasonable will vary with each nation . It is. therefore , desirable ' that in a League treaty intended to avert war the conditions for its denunciation or for the withdrawal of any member should be made so definite and certain that there may be no excise for war growing out of an unreasonable withdrawal or an unreasonable dissent front the right of withdrawal , CHARLES ROBINSON SMITH .
