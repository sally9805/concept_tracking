txt VENICE , Sept. 17. -1 have just passer through a hashish dream . It ' - has beer a cataclysm of exotic loveliness and nightmares , like a frenzy of absinthe . Some time I shall get a hashish fiend and an absinthe maniac together and compare their experiences with a night that I have just lived in Venice under the greatest air raid of the entire war . After our brilliant days and nights along the Italian front in Austria , I dropped off the train at Venice to get a good night 's rest . Venice , as I have understood it . is a mild opiate and good for taking when the nervous system need repose . And Venice , no matter what the time of taking ? In peace or war , under air raids or only drifting in the moonlight on the Grand Canal ? always remains a wonderful and memorable dream . I believe that , after Paris . no ? city in all the world strikes the imagination of Americans so much as Venice .. Next to Paris , they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Therefore , I ' shall attempt to describe my night there under Austrian bombs exactly as it happened . It I employ ' such hectic . terms as hashish and absinthe. it is because the night brought only temporary insanity from which Venice emerged with cOrripara. tively few scars . Permits for Entering Venice . Venice is now the most difficult city of Europe to enter . Even Italians are not permitted to go and come at will . Even residents must have special permission'to remain . In my case , it was necessary to have my credentials from the supreme command of the armies vis ? d by the Admiralty before they would let me in . The few trains that enter and leave the Venice station are run exclusively for the benefit of the Admiralty , and very few persons does the Admiralty consider have business there . Consequently the station is not crowded . There are just enough gondolas and porters waiting for the persons who the officials know in advance will alight from a particular train . In my case I was the only person ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took . me. in hand . The officer explained that my coming had been reported in advance by telephone . He asked me how long I wished to remain . I told him , and he noted on my passport the time when I was due to depart . He told the gondolier that I would go to the . Hotel Royal Danieli. on the Canal San Marco , where also I was expected and would be received . The Royal Daniell is the only good hotel open , and I discovered that it , too , was run chiefly for the benefit of the Admiralty and persons whom the Admiralty approved . The affair was all so prescribed that I liked it . Even my sleeping berth would be arranged for me in the train by which I had chosen to depart . As I leaned back in my gondola , and We softly floated down the Grand Canal , I imagined myself back in the ancient Venice of the Doges. when all men were Prances who had but to speak and he obeyed . Here was all their autocracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon bathing their marble palaces in splendor . For many generations Venice has not been seen as I saw it that night on my arrival , and it is not likely that I shall ever see it that way again . When the war is over that part of Venice which remains will have lights again , and tourists and guides . This was the Venice that almost ruled the world , where merchants were kings , but kings of taste and imagination . It was the Venice of charm , romance , and mystery ; the Venice of deep shadows and brilliant shafts of moonlight that illujitined the marble frescoes and balustraNkes and irradiated the waters so that they , gleamed like shoals of diamonds . Several gondolas floated silently by with only tiny hooded blue lights at their prows . . ? In the Air ! Good Watch . " We were passing the famous House of Gold when I heard a strange , unforgettable cry floating over the waters . It was a cry never heard before in all the world . It haunted me as it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far off and . became faint and then died out in ghostly silence . That cry has come to Venice with the war : .. Per raria ! Boons. guardia ! " ( For the air ! Good watch ! ) It is a. common cry of the night . Whenever there is a moon the watchers on the housetops thus tell the aood people of Venice that no enemy aircraft are in sight . Until I first heard the/ery I had given no thought to the - menace of the afir ; but then I lay back In the gondola and looked into the brilliancy of the perfect - Aqiatic night . " Per l'aria ! Buona o-ua.rdia. : " The ghostly cry came float . // BIGGEST AIR RAID ON MOONLIT VENICE // trig faintly back again , then stronger and more confident . We passed the Rialto , then turned into a narrow and dark canal where there was no moon . But I kept on looking up at the narrow lane of stars between the roofs of the palaces . 1 idly gave heed that on one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stars were blotted for A moment as we glided under the Bridge of Sighs . A minute later a white-liveried parsonage of the Royal Daniell was stretching an arm over the gondola to assist me to alight . Yes , a room was prepared  --  a room with bath . That sounded good after elle Italian front in Austria . Then I had a jar . " Better turn hi early if you want to sleep . " the man advised , " becaese you might have to get up before inornine . " I asked the *reason. and he responded in a tone and manner quite nonchalant : " Oh . because we will probably have a raid . " Too Many Raids to Remember . I asked him how many raids there had been , and he replied that " this one " would make either the thirty-fourth or thirty-fifth ? he could n't exactly remember  --  and the number of the raid did n't matter . anyway . He insisted that on this night we should probably have a raid " because of the moon " ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had the moon . I asked if it was compulsory that I arise from bed and come below . He replied that it was not ; that the only compulsion in the matter was that at the moment of the alarm he should knock at my door and advise me to come down . If I wanted to stay up and perhaps get killed , why , of course , might exercise my privilege . Then he added : " But you ought to get up . Only about a dozen foreigners have ever been lucky enough to see a real air raid on Venice . If it is a good raid it will be worth seeing . " I hesitated to dip into the matter of the difference between a good raid and a bad raid . but I discovered later that his nonchalance was typically Venetian . The populace long ago lost ail signs . of nerves when Austriein airplanes appeared overhead , and the majority , indeed , have lost track of the number of raids . So , whether the one I witnessed was the thirty-third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been able properly to check up . As the hotel personage said , it did n't Matter , anyway  --  all were the same , that Is , good or bad , as one looked at the matter . I went to bed and tried to sleep , but awoke every half hour to turn on Ms electric lamp at the head of - the ? bed and to read a four days ' old edition of a London newspaper . Just at midnight 1 glanced at my watch . About a fifth of a second after midnight the electricity le cut off , and , as the window shutters were closed tightly , according to order , I was in pitch darkness . " Air raid . " I said to myself , and then lay back an the pillows to wait tor the sound af the signal gun . It came eery few seconds . Before turning in I had had the forethought to place my clothes where 1 could get at them in the dark , and even as I fumbled about a knock came at the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air attack on Venice had begun . ? 1 pushed open the shutters to permit a ray of moonlight to aid my dressing . Across the wide canal was the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore , white and glorious , the tower standing out clear against the brilliant - sky . I glanced down at the sidewalk below my window . The few denizens of the Venetian night were scurrying along to the municipal shelters provided in such emergencies . Several gondolas coming from the direction of the Piazza of St. Mark were sliding under --  the arched bridges for shelter , their fares jumping to landeand hugging the protection of walls and doorways . The moon was shining high and full from the direction of the Lido , making a wide path of gold across the lagoon that separates Venice from the Adriatic . Beginning of the Uproar . As I watched , hell 's overture began . There were sharp flashes all along the shore line from the direction of the Lido and a series of rapid explosions that made jagged patches of instantaneous light square in the path of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moon . So I watched that aerial body intently . Added to the roar of - the breaking shrapnel came the sharp bark of machine guns across the canal almost opposite my window . I could see long , horizontal sheets of flames with unshaken reflections in the still waters . The flames came and went exactly like telegraphic signals and then disappeared , to be taken up again a little distance further along the shore - by another collection of machine guns . I turned back to the moon . A black line suddenly darted straight across it . I looked higher into the heavens , and then , directly overhead , I could make out the invading- airplanes. liat despite the brilliancy of night they were probably ? too high up . I remembered that black line darting across the path of the moon , so I fumbled in a suitcase for my glasees . Then I looked again . Another black line darted across , but this time I could see plainly that it was an airplane . I started back quickly , for something had crashed down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or excitement , or both , I had forgotten the fact that shrapnel , ( even friendly shrapnel , ) when it goes up is bound to come down , and In that case becomes dangerous . I partially closed the shutters and peered out at the walk . - Something else crashed and struck fire from the stones . I decided to go below . It was quite likely that some of that shrapnel might enter my window . Up to this point I had not yet heard the familiar sound of an exploding aero bomb , but while descending the stairway I got it even above the roar of the three-inch cannon and machine runs , which had now become an unending roll of thunder , with never a break in their awful monotony . After I reached the lobby I reflected during a search for " thesafest place " on the good fortune and bad fortune of Venice during an air raid . Her good fortune is that at least two-thirds of the city 's area is taken up by canals and lagoons . Therefore , it is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall in the water and do no harm . On the other hand , Venice is unfortunate in the Tact that there is not a cellar in the entire place . On account of the water the ground floor is the lowest floor down that one can go . Another difficulty is that the ancient house construction in Venice very often left the garden space in the centre , surrounded by , four walls . Many old palaces , when modernized , acquired glass roofs over these Central spaces . alv hotel was one of these ancient palaces , made new . Seeking a Safer Place . I looked up at the ornate glass roof over our magnificent lobby and I pondered . Truly a most unhealthy place if a bomb should suddenly drop there . With no hesitation and , in fact , in some haste I edged my way to the smoke room , which was directly bounded on two sides by canals and , therefore , to my mind . very much more secure . f tried to buy a cigar , but the bar boy had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my calculations on safety . The room was lighted with candles . There were plenty of comfortable leather chairs . so I sat down ' ant : listened to the infernal din outside . An Italian Naval Captain strolled leisurely in and seated himself before a small table . I shall never forget that man , how he looked and the things he said . He was a ' magnificent specimen , quite tall . as . Italian naval men frequently are . In fact , he was one of the finest looking men I had ever seen . He was dressed in immacula te while drill , with the gold Stars of his rank braided on the shoulders , giving him added distinction . He nodded to me as he entered , then later turned and spoke in faultless English . saying that he took me to be an American . After that we had a conversation . He had been to the theatre , he told me , and , even though in a hurry to get back to his ship out near the Lido , he had waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to shelters . " in order not to give a bad example by undue haste , " as he expressed it . Then he had taken a gondola for his ship . After a short ride he had seen it was impossible to get there through the storm of pelting shrapnel . In fact , he had been warned ashore by a soldier on the quay . " So I came in here , " he added . ? " You did . not choose this by any chance because it was safe ? " I said . " You could not have picked out a more unsafe place . " He laughed . " No. " he said , " that 's a fact ; but I came here because it 's comfortable , and I want to write some letters . " Letter Writing Amid Turmoil . I watched him as he drew up a candle and began to write . Twice during the operation I could hear shrapnel beat like hail against the steel shutter of the open window about eighteen inches from his head . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . lee glanced at his watch . It was 1 o'clock . ? " They generally keep it going about an hour and a half , " he remarked , and went back 6 ; his writing . Another half hour passed ? an eternity of internal din , so that whenever any words were spoken we had to shout . Again the shrapnel beat against our windows , and quite often now we could hear falling bombs , several times so close that they shook our building . Then came a lull in the storm , the sort of lull that comes in an ocean tempest while the ' elements are girding themselves up to attack witn renewed vigor . During the lull the Captain sealed his letters . pushed back his chair and came and stood before me . He yawned , then ejaculated : " What a beastly nuisance ! " That was all he said , but it was such a strange commonplace for that scene that I began to laugh . He seemed to understand why , for then he laughed , too . " Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and have a look . " Vie got as far as the ( loot and a step or so outside when a soldier suddenly loomed before us and ordered us into shelter . This soldier was greatly annoyed . " Have you no sense ? " ho asked . " And do n't you know that when you come out here I have to risk my life and cane out , too . YOU ? you ( His voice became shrill ; ) you ought to think of my family . " The Captain laughed and agreed with him , but we went back to the doorway . " lie is quite right , " the Captain said . " There Is no necessity of running risks with shrapnel and machine guns , eepeciany when that sort of thing can usually be avoided , but as for bombs ? " the Captain shrugged his shoulders and then elated a basic truth that can be applied to every raid from air or even to an ordinary artillery . bombardment . " But as for bombs , " he repeated . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bomb hits you or it does not , and it does . not matter where you go . " That is quite so . A bomb can go through five floors to the cellar and kill every person in refuge there , or it can strike full on a brick pavement and fail to explode . Whir of Enemy 's Motors . As we stood in the doorway the antiaircraft guns seemed to redouble their activities ) . We peered out from time to time and could see nothing in the sky , but there was never a second or silence . The hotel now shook to its foundations as the aero bombs exploded in the vicinity and the heavens seemed about to break apart , so thick were the great patches of flame from exploding shrapnel . I forgot the moon . These shrapnel explosions looked like half a dozen moons all smashed into a dozen ragged bits and flung helter-skelter through the sky . The shores of the lagoon across from us were now a constant line of streaked flame . The flashes from the shore line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships in the harbor was constantly visible , while from way out on the Adriatic and from the land batteries down the coast came the dull , sullen roars of giant guns . Above all the conflagration and noise there entered a new and sinister note , worse even than the sound of the dropping bombs , that was so easily distinguishable from shells . The Captain seized my arm and whispered in my ear . " Listen , " he said . I listened and heard the whirring sounds of airplane motors which meant that the enemy had become braver despite the demonstration against them , and were circling down closer to the city . A bomb exploded , seemingly a few hundred yards to our right , and thought of the Ducal palace , of the Tintorettos , of the ceiling that is one of the glories of the world . A Bomb Fails Near . Another bomb fell slightly further off , and- I thought of the frescoes of St. Mark 's , of the wonderful horses on the roof of the Campanile and the famous lion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the past . and the Venice of always . My same thought of earlier in the night came again , only in a more poignant form and more dramatic setting than on the Gr : ad Canal under merely the stars and moon . Truly Venice has never been seen as it was on that night , and it is not likely that it will ever be seen in that way again , for this was Venice such as oven the Doges had never dreamed of . My reflections came to an end when a borne fell directly in front of us and about fifty yards away , and splashed the waters of the canal . We could hear the wale of motors , and the batteries and machine guns all began ' concentrating over our heads . The result was a veritable storm of shrapnel and bullets . We crouched far back in the door . Leaden pellets fell like hail , striking a hundred searks of fire on the sidewalk not more than a few feet in front of where we stood , while next came the vicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our hotel on both the right and left of the door . That settled our sightseeing , although later , when the orchestra of fire diminished a trifle , we reached careful hands out along the ground through the door and scooped up lead and steel souvenirs It was 2:30 and the Captain complained bitterly that such occasions as these were causing him to lose his sleep . This raid was lasting far longer than usual , he said , and would probably keep up until after 3 o'clock . He tried to get some ifnogodt , obhuitstbheedb.ar boy persisted in keepThe Storm Is Over . Then came a silence that was uncanny and profound . The raid was finished and had been the longest on record , lasting just three hours . I went out with the Captain to help him to find his gondola , which had taken shelter under a bridge . Then I hurried as quickly as possible to the piazza of St. Mark 's . All the monuments were insack , just as I had seen them earlier in the night . There was plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pavement not far from St. Mark 's Church . The extent of the damage I could get next day , an officer asstut  --  ehdenme. it was useless to go about it 1 did find out from Harvey Carrel , the efficient American Consul , who keeps an exact record for Washington and has even acted as an official observer of raids from the top of the Campanile . In this raid during the three hours ' attack 4t was estimated that twentyfour Auatrian planes had been circling constantly over the town . In addition to anti-aircraft guns , Venice is also guarded by a system of balloons connected by electric wires that are sent aloft to a great height as soon as a raid is signaled . They are so small that they can not be seen , nor arietil machines to tell the toll of Austea they have taken . Venice , being on the sea , is like London in her vulnerability to air attack , and is even more vuinerable so it is almost impossible for her to ' fight airplanes with airplanes , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this case fired over seven thousand rounds . But again the censorsnip prevents further details . Nobody Killed or Injured . Speaking generally of the destruction from all the raids , Venice has suffered much , but by far the greater part of historic i .. tact , including all her n uments . Strange as it may seem , during the raid I witnessed , which was the ? loneest of all , with more machines over the town and more bombe striking the land , not a soul was killed or injured . I found that out before I went to bed . A high official came along and told me 50 as I leaned against one of the marble columns of Florian 's in the etiazza of St. Mark  --  that famous cafe has not closed its doors in 350 years . I looked again up and down the great square . Once more the moon held sway and seemed to settle just over St. Mark 's , grotesque with its sandbags all the way to its pearly faeade and golden exotic minarets . I looked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon his pedestal . Yes , the hashish dream was ended . and I could go to rest . As I entered the hotel I heard again that mournful cry : " Per l'aria I Buono. guardia I "
