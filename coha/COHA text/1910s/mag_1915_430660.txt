 | TO draw the portrait of a great city is as nearly impossible as to " indict a whole people . " The task demands too huge a canvas . The drawing must be done at the same time with too broadly sweeping strokes and with too much meticulous detail . I would paint a picture of Paris after fourteen months of war . But the thing can not be done . I can only tear out of my notebook leaves filled with rough notes and random sketches . One can imagine many reasons for coming to Paris at any time ? some good , some not so good , some far from good . But there is one that ought to overshadow all the rest ? that Paris is beautiful . It is beautiful itself , and it is full of beautiful things . Now the beautiful things are hidden away in these uncertain days , but for the rest - To stand in the Place du Carrousel and look up the splendid stretch of the Champs Elysees to the culminating majesty of the Arc de Triomphe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . wonder that he has been willing to make so many cities of the world commonplace and consecrated to the dreary god of utility . To drive about the city in a fiacre ? thanks be to the war that has taken away so many swooping motor taxis and brought back so many of their leisurely , cosy predecessors ? and catch glimpse after glimpse of fine vistas framing stately churches and dignified public buildings , of splendid parks , of worthy monuments , of broad spaces and noble avenues , is to record upon the tablets of the mind an indelible impression ? Paris the beautiful . This impression the war has done nothing to efface ; nor can it ? unless and until the enemy shall succeed in meting out to Paris the grievous fate of Rheims . The beauty of Paris is unscathed ; the charm of Paris ? ah , that is another thing . But here I hesitate . To say that Paris has lost its charm is to say too much . But it is only by saying something like that that I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little . The beauty of Paris persists ; the charm of Paris is veiled , hidden , supprest . For beauty and charm , I take it , are two things . A statue in cold marble or a body in cold flesh may have beauty ; only a warm and living woman can have the more precious attribute . It was not until the kiss of the Prince fell upon her lips that the beauty of the Princess was infused with charm . Paris is not dead -- but surely Paris sleeps . Where are the gayety , the lightness of heart , the sparkle , the verve ? in a word , the charm , of yesteryear ? It is inevitable that a visit to Paris after London in these dun days should provoke comparison . The temptation is irresistible , but in yielding to it I would be absolved from the charge of invidiousness . The comparison is inevitable , but so is the difference . For Paris has heard the guns of the enemy clamoring at the gates . London , save for the irritating but on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is untouched . Paris is the capital of a land whose richest acres lie in the alien 's grasp . London is the heart of a country lying inviolate behind the walls of oak now turned to steel . England knows war at arm 's length ; France feels it gnawing at her vitals . So London " as usual " is by no means an absurdly inaccurate phrase . Paris " as usual " can express only a pious hope and a grim determination . Curiously enough , while London is full of soldiers , Paris is empty of them . London streets swarm with them , London restaurants are yellow with khaki , London music halls draw half their income , at a snap guess , from Tommy ? and his officers . You sit beside them on the busses and in the tube trains , you stumble over them on the grass in the parks . Half the girls in London hang on uniformed arms , half the people in your hotel seem to have come up from the country to consort with soldier sons and brothers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier is , comparatively speaking , infrequent on the boulevards and avenues , in restaurants , theaters , cafes and hotels . In the French capital the misty blue of the uniform puts accents into the picture ; in the British capital the greeny yellow of the khaki mellows the picture 's entire tone . The soldiers of Paris are different , too . The boys iri khaki look just that ? boys who have put on khaki as a new dress and are not yet quite accustomed to it . The men in blue wear their blue as tho they had spent years instead of weeks in it , as tho they had worked and lived and , perhaps , suffered in it . Their uniforms are worn and faded ? and many of the faces match the clothes . There is just the difference . England has a great army in the making ; France has a great army in being , which has toiled and fought , and still goes back to toil and fight again . It is the masses of the material being molded into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris it is bits of the splendid French war machine , released for a moment from their appointed places in the mechanism . For France has been forced by geographical position and the grim shadow over its frontier of a threatening miltiarism to be a military nation . England , snug behind the ramparts of the British fleet , could wait to create its army when the need should arise . Another suggestion of the same difference . On every bare space in London flaunts a gaudy poster , one of a hundred different designs , exhorting loyal Englishmen to enlist to fight for king and country . In Paris here and there hang the torn remnants of a single uniform announcement tersely declaring that general mobilization is ordered for midnight on the second of August , 1914 . England called , and still calls with ever greater earnestness , for volunteers . France merely notified men trained and ready that the hour had struck . An entirely adequate reason for coming to Paris at any time is to flaner ? the word is untranslatable , but the act of contemplative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal . The streets of Paris are the flanear 's Promised Land . A Barmecide shopping tour ? but that is tautology , for all shopping as distinguished from buying has the exotic and insubstantial quality of a Barmecide feast ? skirting the treasure houses of the Rue de la Paix , or among the antique shops of the Boulevard St. Germain and the Quartier Latin , or thru the haunts of tomorrow 's fashions in the Faubourg St. Honor-6 , or by the print shops of the Rue de Rivoli and on the Rive Gauche , provides the stuff the flaneur 's dreams are made  | of . He loves a sentimental journey among the embodiments of feminine charm that throng the Elysian Fields and the Wood of Boulogne on an afternoon of early fall sunshine , falling in love at first sight a dozen times in an hour and out again as promptly at the first sight of the next corner . The hour of the appetizer , that twilight interval between the business of the day and the business of the evening , is the flaneur 's hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a long drawn out glass of coffee , a sirop at . vin blanc , the insidious essence of wormwood , or the incomprehensible sugar and water . Then he surveys the passing world with a reflective eye and finds it good . But nous avons change tout cela . Or more accurately , the gods of war have changed it all . Paris is too sober to flaneur , too sombre to flaneur in . Many of the shops are closed ? " closed on account of mobilization " runs the legend on the shutters . Practically all of them lock their doors for a couple of hours in the middle of the day because of a depleted staff . It is not good form to buy lavishly and to indulge in luxuries . France needs the last sou in the toe of the last stocking-bank ; and when a nation is sternly practising self-denial it is no time for the individual to spend with a careless hand . So one flaneurs among the shops , if one does it at all , shamefacedly and a little furtively ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no heart for business . The restaurants and cafes are deserted . I use the word not carelessly and figuratively , but with deliberate literalness . It is not so in London ; but in Paris it is . Not only the smart ones ? that was to be expected , but the simple , every day ones ? that is almost pathetic . One lunches at Armenonville , one of the most famous of the outdoor resorts in the Bois de Boulogne , where Paris on a splendid October day should be seen at its gayest ? and lunches in impressive and depressing solitude . One goes to Marguery 's for the renowned Sole Marguery ? the sole is there delectable as ever , but a wilderness of empty tables somehow makes it taste flat in the mouth . Another day finds me strolling at the hour of dejeuner in the Boulevard St. Germain . An opportune little restaurant ? and the little restaurants of Paris have , nothing in common with those of my own land save their size ? catches my eye . I enter and sit down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The soup is good , the omelet French ? there is no higher term of praise ? the plat du jour savory , the cheese sound and ripe , the fruit a little withered perhaps , but not illflavored , the coffee hot and no more embittered with inevitable chicory than was ? inevitable . I lunched not merely passably but well . Tables were ready for a score or more ? I lunched alone . With the cheese another table was set in the opposite corner , and Madame , descended from her stool behind the desk , the solitary waiter , and , I suspect , the cook , lunched too . But patrons there were none . The waiter , as he poured out my coffee during an interval of his own repast , satisfied my curiosity . Monsieur was mobilized and at the front . He himself was too old to fight ? as yet . But who knows ? . Perhaps even his time might come . Yes , this was a not unusual thing in these days . Patrons were few . In other times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , would I find lunching here a day like this . But so it goes . It is the war . The war takes everyone . So is it everywhere . The restaurants deserted , the cafes patronless . Even the streets seem strange for Paris , where the streets ought to'be alive and gay . There are no men of military age ? ca va sans dire ? for Frenchmen all are soldiers now . There are no motor busses hurtling thru the streets ? and Paris without these Juggernauts is safer surely , but hardly natural . Once out near the front I found the reason why . An old familiar shape came trundling down the road , familiar and yet odd in grim war gray with bulging load of precious war supplies . Mobilization has taken the busses too . The streets by night ? a greater difference still . The picture that the words " Paris by night " call up ? ca n'existe plus ? there is no such a thing . In place of brilliancy we find a gruesome dusk ; in place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits , a sprinkling of passers-by , groping their way toward home or other goal . The sidewalk groups of chairs and tables outside cafes that make in better times the outdoor life of Paris a thing to conjure with are empty now . None sit and sip and chat and watch life flowing by . Those that are left go early home to bed . After three weeks of London , punctuated by four pleasant little visits from earthquake-dropping Zeppelins , and other three weeks of Paris with tranquil nights and no sign of hostile visitors , one finds oneself wondering . Why the difference ? Paris is only half as far from the enemy 's lines as London . It offers as fair a mark . Why no bombs for months and months ? Gradually one gets a glimmering of a possible explanation . Each afternoon between four and six a little spectacle is staged that never fails to fascinate . If I am in my hotel room a giant humming comes dropping down the central court on which my windows look . It sounds like nothing but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw me to the street . There overhead a monster bird wings its way across the sky . Slowly , perhaps a little wearily , it flies , from east of north to west of south . It comes from out that quarter where the fighting is . Then comes another from the opposite compass point . No weariness to this one 's flight ; it shoots along like cloth-yard shaft from good yew bow . They meet and pass and vanish , each to its appointed goal . It is the changing of the guard . Each hour of the day ? and night as well , as you shall see ? four faithful birds like these mount guard above the city , and sail and dart and skim about , and watch and watch and watch . If need arise they can do more than watch , for to swift.wings they add sharp beaks and ruthless claws . It is my last night in Paris , a " wonderful clear night of stars . " Loitering across the Place de la Concorde to my hotel , my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distant land to con the stars and find all there the old familiar ones of home , Jupiter , an incandescent globe , commands the sky . But what 's that other star just there that glows as bright as he ? The planets do not shine in pairs like that . And look ! This one has moved , is gliding steadily across the sky . Right overhead it goes from east to west . Once past the zenith it begins to shrink , and dwindles slowly to a point of light that presently snuffs out . But soon the point of light is there again , growing and growing till this second planet rivals Jupiter again . Then once more it shrinks and vanishes off in the east . Again it is the changing of the guard . Our lawless planet waning and waxing and waning again is but a biplane watching with sleepless eye above the sleeping city . No hostile aircraft minded to drop its bombs on helpless folk but shall run a gantlet perilous . Come it by day or come by night , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight . One reads of London raids , " our aeroplanes went up . " In  | Paris , if the raid should ever come , " our " aeroplanes are up . Among those many reasons for coming to Paris what more compelling one than to see the fashions . It is only in Paris that one finds le dernier cri , the style not of yesterday nor even of today , but of tomorrow and the day after . As I write , I find in a morning journal a complaint from manufacturers in Switzerland that they are in perplexity about modes , " because Paris , which used to give the lead in regard to innovations , does not do so now . " It is a sad predicament for the rest of the world . It can not be fashionable , for there is no one to set the fashion . Paris has laid aside for a sterner task its time-honored leadership in the gentle art of dressing as everybody else does now in order to dress as nobody else did last year . So it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of le dernier cri is ineradicable . It shows itself in many little ways . For instance , it is the new fashion ? an inflexible code ? not to linger at dinner in a public place after half past ten . ( Besides the lights go out . ) There is no longer any evening dress ; for men the morning suit for dining out and for the theater , for women the tailor made in somber tones . These be new fashions , but there is one more striking than all ? and more popular . It is a simple style , not depending for its effect upon exaggerated lines or startling color schemes . One sees it everywhere . One can not pass a dozen women on the street that one of them does not affect this newest mode . It is a versatile style , adaptable for morning wear , the home , the street , receptions , luncheons , dinner , for work , for leisure , for every kind of life ? save one , I think . One does not play in it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . It 's chic , this style ; what mode Parisienne is not ? It has that grace of line , that artistry of cut , all that I-know-not-what that proves the French modiste an artist , not an artizan . All classes wear it , from the gracious femme du monde , costumed by Paquin , to the pert midinette , whose dress is but the product of her nimble fingers and the midnight oil . It is worn by young and old ; but more , it seems , by young than old ? a startling , saddening thing . In fabric and design it is a varied style , only in color is it uniform . There persists a dreadful monotone . For it is black , all black , unvaried , unrelieved . It is the widow 's costume . On every street , in every shop , one almost thinks in every home , the widows of the men of France who give their lives that France may live wear the glorious dread regalia of their sacrifice . Thus my rough notes on Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of the pleasant land face the future and the task that still is theirs ? For the answer to such a question one can not give chapter and verse . One does not find the whole answer anywhere ? one finds its elements everywhere . It is in the air like the tone of a vibrant autumn day . It thrills the nerves like a charged electric atmosphere . It is sad to see France so changed , But France is not sad . France suffers but its spirit does not quail . France bleeds but its courage mounts only the higher . France has but one mind , exprest in the word of the Apostle , " This one thing I do . " France is stoical under its affliction , united in its unflinching purpose , aroused , unfaltering , determined . Whatever may be the outcome , France will endure to the end .
