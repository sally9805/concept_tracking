txt // out of the ordinary . Bequeathed to the Museum in 1910 , it charms visitors by its beauty of line and decoration and by its unusual numbers . The quest for the personal history of this remarkable Lowestoft finally led to Annapolis , the home of the Chase family . And here is the letter : " Samuel Chase , signer of the Declaration of Independence , built his Annapolis residence about 1770 . The china known as the Chase Lowestoft ' was ordered by him for this house and imported soon after the Revolution . By rare good fortune it remained in the family for more than one hundred years . By rarer good fortune it passed into the hands of a man so publicspirited that by the terms of his will it became the property of the Metropolitan Museum of Fine Arts where thousands may enjoy it yearly . This man was the late James T. Woodward , Esq. , of New York City , formerly of Maryland . " About twenty years ago , when many of the furnishings of the house were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old mansion as a historic landmark , // Mr. Woodward purchased the Lowestoft . The building is now known as the Chase Home . ' " The china is richly decorated and each piece shows the Chase coat of arms consisting of a shield bearing three stars and surmounted by a bird . " From England came the next document describing the now famous Blackheath china . " Golfers in England are talking of an interesting find in old golf club china . It consists of some bowls and jugs , described as Lowestoft ' but made in China . The pieces are six in number and were used by members of the Blackheath Golf Club , which dates back to 16o8 and is the senior of all golf clubs . Until 1844 the club held its meetings and weekly dinners at the Green Man Inn at Blackheath , and in removing to a clubhouse of its own it is conjectured that the pieces were left at the old rendezvous and forgotten . " In 1867 the Green Man Inn was torn down and the furniture sold . Then the china @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Quest of the Quaint specimens are preserved with other beautiful pieces by a member of his family living in London . The china is similar to some now in the possession of the club which is thought to have been purchased in 1786 . " A punch bowl , which had been broken and skilfully mended , is said to be the most interesting of the discoveries . It is white , with colored edgings , and bears a shield marked Knuckle Club , instituted 17th January , 1788 . ' Above the shield appears the crest , a boot couped at the ankle , thereon a spur all proper ' with the motto : Duke Periculum . ' " On the other side of the bowl is a shield bearing the arms , to use the technical description furnished by W. E. Hughes , author of Chronicles of Blackheath Golfers , gules , two arrows in saltire argent , surmounted by a fess checky of the second and first , between three buckles within a bordure indented or . ' Above are the crest and motto of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been borne by a gentleman of Edinburgh in 1672 4 // named McAlla , ' writes Mr. Hughes , ' were those of Mr. George M. Macaulay , alderman of Coleman Street Ward , in the city of London , who was captain of the Blackheath Golf Club in the year 1793 , and who is frequently mentioned in the minutes of the Knuckle Club , of which he was elected a member in November , 1789 , so that there can be but little doubt that the bowl in question was a gift from him to the latter club . ' " A second bowl has on two sides of it a golfing figure , with the motto Vi et Arte . ' The jugs are alike in style . They are white with dark blue ornamentations , having lids surmounted by kylins , and each will hold nearly a gallon . Two are inscribed in front Blackheath Golf Club Treasurer 's Jug ' and the other two Blackheath Knuckle Jorum Jug . ' " Such old bowls and jugs , of different dates , and many quaint silver cups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club-house . The course on Blackheath Common has only seven holes , and it was here that the custom // originated of wearing a red coat , so that the pedestrians would the more easily note the coming of a pair of golfers . " Red coats are no longer obligatory , but the use of a fore caddie is compulsory at Blackheath , and he has to carry a red flag . There is no play on Saturdays on account of the crowds on the common , and as nearly all the members now golf at other links the Blackheath club-house and course are kept up chiefly through sentiment . " The club-house has been in use since 1865 , the club having made two changes since the removal from the Green Man Inn . The building is leased and was not built for a club-house . " The first golf club-house was built for the Honorable Company of Edinburgh Golfers , on Leith Links in 1768 , and while scores of houses had been leased for the purpose , it is curious that the next clubhouse built for golfers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews . " There was a need for huge punch bowls and capacious jugs in the golf of the eightLowestoft // eenth century in Scotland and England . The old betting books reveal countless fines of a dozen or two dozen of claret and of matches for even greater quantities . " The old golfers were of a convivial sort , and the wagers and fines were consumed at the next sitting . Tavern parlors were the accustomed dining places , and the Green Man of Blackheath is only one of the hostelries famous in the early chronicles of the game . " Americans may not at once place the Knuckle Club . At first the play at the Blackheath Golf Club season was only in the summer months , and toward the end of the eighteenth century the Knuckle Club came into existence for the winter play . Nearly the same players were members of the two clubs , and winter or summer , the competitions were followed by a dinner at the Green Man . " The Knuckle Club subsequently changed its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence of some twenty years , became merged in 1844 into the Blackheath Golf Club . " // For many years china collectors in America neglected Lowestoft , perhaps for the excellent reason that really good specimens were difficult to find . People with family sets were not keen about parting with them , and the pieces that drifted into the open market were often badly cracked . Cracked Lowestoft is not attractive . On the pearly white paste every dark line shows forth as clearly as a cobweb in the best parlor . Broken Lowestoft is quite another matter . Those wizards , the expert china menders , can replace gaps in a punch bowl , supply knobs and handles , and reconstruct missing spouts . With inherited Lowestoft , a patched-up piece is far better than no loaf at all . It will defy detection , except on closest examination , although it might be disastrous to serve punch or brew tea , if the repaired article happened to be bowl or pot . A mended piece in a shop is quite a different matter . Most collectors are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of historic interest or family associations , a mended teapot is merely a // mended teapot . Moreover , the cost of fine repairing is considerable , and restored Lowestoft is consequently rather expensive . Another reason for the long neglect of this ware was due to the fad for historical blue . By contrast the Chinese pieces seemed lacking in decorative qualities , although usually conceded to be the aristocracy of colonial china . Several circumstances have brought about the present lively interest in everything labeled " Lowestoft . " At least a dozen notable collections , rich in this particular ware , have been offered for public sale within the past year , thus bringing the opportunity of purchase to many people . A second and more vital reason is the increasing appreciation of the furniture , silver , and china associated with our early history . Few wares have so personal , so intimate a quality as the china made and decorated for well-to-do Americans between the time of the Revolution and the War of 1812 . With the growing quest for the Oriental ware has developed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lowestoft controversy . If not exactly buried , it has been temporarily interred , or at least allowed to lie dormant . At the Hunter sale in New York , when so many beautiful things were dispersed , a case containing two teapots and one coffeepot created a good deal of interest . It is safe to say that ten years ago these three objects would have made a sensation and been the cause of minor newspaper comments . It is significant of the change of attitude on the part of American collectors that three pieces of genuine soft paste Lowestoft should have been passed over so quickly by both auctioneer and audience . To be sure , one of the teapots brought sixty-seven dollars , but had it been marked " Worcester " or " Derby " it would have made quite as good a record . Indeed it so closely resembled Worcester that it might easily have been mistaken for a teapot made during the Wall period . The colors were red , blue , and gold in a charming flower pattern . The other pieces were decorated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // teapot bore the mark of the makers and was undoubtedly the choicest piece . Following came twenty items catalogued as " Chinese , ? Lowestoft ' so called . " Worthy of note is the comma separating the " Chinese " from the word " Lowestoft . " Evidently " Chinese Lowestoft " as a descriptive term did not find favor with the careful makers of the catalogue , Doctor Hunter and Doctor Edwin Atlee Barber . Most of this " Lowestoft , so called " was made for European patrons and more sumptuously decorated than the pieces found in this country . When the Maynard collection of Boston was sold at the Copley Plaza , the choicest types of " American Lowestoft " came under the hammer . The corner cupboards of Salem , Marblehead , Nantucket , and New Bedford do not contain more beautiful pieces than were offered to collectors on this important occasion . The Stiegel glass , the early American silver , the rare furniture , and this charming china will long be remembered . From one of the cabinets came the toddy jug illustrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quaint On one side is depicted a ship under full sale and on the other the same vessel in a terrific gale . A grapevine border in gold and rich blue enamel outlines the top of the jug and is shown again on the cover . Other good things in this cabinet were six helmet pitchers , with tea caddies to match , teapots and bowls of exquisite decorations , a mustard pot and a pickle-leaf showing Washington 's tomb and the initials J. R. T. ' enclosed in a garland . These pieces formed part of a memorial set once belonging to General Terrier of Washington 's staff and are extremely valuable . A tureen cover with the same view is now at Mt . Vernon , accompanied by a detailed history of the set . The Maynard Lowestoft furnished convincing proof of the variety which a carefully selected collection exhibits . There were medallions filled with landscapes in sepia , armorial bearings in blue and gold , carefully executed crests in two or more colors , many types of floral decorations in plum , pink , reddish-brown and pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not made to order , others showing the careful working out of elaborate instructions , but all suggesting something distinctly American and consequently very pleasant to see and doubly interesting to own . CHAPTER VIII THE HOUSE OF A THOUSAND JUGS IF there were a " thousand candles " , there are probably a thousand jugs , but I am not sure about the candles . The beauty about the house with the jugs is that it forms a most consistent setting for all the fine old things within its walls . The owner has a hobby for jugs , but he also has a hobby for old furniture , old clocks , old mirrors , old silver , old prints , old glass , and old china of many types . His collection of old Worcester is extensive ; his early Meissen extremely choice . Perhaps his greatest hobby is the large old house with its rambling halls and generous fireplaces . Like many New England collectors , he began with his inherited possessions and built up from them . UnThe House of a Thousand rugs 103 like many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a physician , which was hardly fair , seeing how much he had in the beginning , ? for great are the opportunities which come to the collecting M.D. Next to the tin peddler , immortalized by Alice Morse Earle , one day exchanging new pans for old brass and the next new brooms for Lowestoft , the most fortunate individual is the physician with a large country practice . His opportunities are hardly those of Mrs. Earle 's hero , but he comes very near the center of family life , knows many of the family secrets , sometimes the family skeleton , not infrequently the family pantry . Closer than the minister , in some instances , is the doctor . Gratitude can not be measured by the dollar mark , therefore his own cupboard is the richer . Wills are sometimes made in his favor when there are a dozen heirs to every teacup . All in all , he is particularly blessed . If , in addition , he possesses the collector 's instinct to a high degree , much knowledge about everything old under the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spirit , his house will overflow with the rare and the beautiful , the queer and the quaint . So , altogether , this old dwelling is a treasure house , and the contents are as many-sided as the owner . It is a collector 's habitation , but first of all it is livable with old things put to their original use . Naturally it has a beauty beyond the dwelling merely filled with " antiques . " There is no clutter . The repose is eighteenth century rather than twentieth , but the space is eighteenth ; also eighteenth is the attic . The many windows are unadorned with curtains . There are green blinds without and white shutters within , but no shades . Need it be added that this is a bachelor 's house ? But the gain in architectural beauty is conceded . The choicest of the jugs , numbering fifty , fill a large cabinet . They are comparatively small and in the " creamer " class . First to claim attention is a goatand-bee specimen , proof in every particular . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hand , 1 The House of a Thousand rugs o s noting the two diminutive goats and the rather large bee , and recalling that the earliest dated piece of Chelsea , 1745 , is in the form of this famous design . It is now known that jugs of this model were made at both Chelsea and Bow , which settles one long china controversy . The jug of the cabinet has all the characteristics of early Chelsea , including a glaze which has the brilliancy of glass . So highly polished is the surface and with so many reflected lights , that it is impossible to secure a good photograph , while the most attractive quality about the jug eludes the camera . The soft velvety texture of the paste must be felt to be appreciated . To pick out number two of the cabinet is difficult , so many jugs seem to take second place . My preference is for a creamer of black " basaltes " , classic in outline and decorated with the strawberry vine in low relief . In every detail it is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very fine specimen of Jackfield , a little hot-water jug standing on four feet and as glittering as to glaze o6 The Quest of the Quaint as the goat-and-bee , and as black as that is white . The pottery at Jackfield , Shropshire , was one of the oldest in England . As early as 1713 , under the direction of the Thursfield family , its reputation was well established . In 178o , John Rose , of pottery fame , became owner and manager . His long apprenticeship with Turner of Caughley had given him an excellent grasp of design . Jackfield , during this period , took on a different character . Flower motives in green and red and other colors ornamented the surface , and in contrast with the black glaze , produced a striking effect . There is a distinction , however , to the undecorated ware which is charmingly set forth in the little jug of the cabinet . In contrast is an undecorated piece of cream ware modeled on the lines of a little Roman lamp . Of slightly different design , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clear white paste , sparingly ornamented in a semi-Chinese flower motif and showing a narrow but colorful border inside the wide lip . It The House of a Thousand rugs 107 looks like Minton , but no mark confirms the theory . My third choice for second honors is a most unusual bit of Spode , vivid as to decorations and suggesting in its outline Mason Iron Stone . Decidedly Oriental in feeling is the charming flower motif with the clear , green foliage and the highly colored petals . Quite un-English is the brilliant lilac seen in two of the flowers . Josiah Spode , Jr. , was a potter of great skill , and in this little pitcher he is seen in a most attractive mood . He belongs to the early " nineteenth " , however , and " nineteenth " will never fascinate as does " eighteenth . " Yet Spode , together with Davenport , preserved the best of the old traditions , each one perfecting a beautiful ware . Spode 's introduction of bone ash was one of the big china events of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two unmarked specimens claiming kinship through the color of their decorations . One has an embossed pattern of selfcolor , a creamy white , over which is an intricate design in deep blue . The other i o 8 The Quest of the Quaint carries an Oriental scheme of roses and birds . They are quite unlike in outline , ? the first very English , the second merely semi-English . When in doubt fall back upon Worcester . This pleasing theory has given a name to many nameless things but hardly with so cautious a collector as the owner of this collection . There are several things which he frankly admits are unclassified . For instance , who made the jug of the gay mandarins , so Chinese in decoration , so English in outline and paste ? Sometimes it is grouped with the Lowestoft helmet pitcher , sometimes placed in a corner by itself . It resembles old Plymouth in hardness , pseudo-Lowestoft in grayish-white , penciled ware as to handle and spout and colored Canton in decoration . Yet it is not hard paste in the strict use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solon , ? if not Solomon ? with that of Hobson and Barber added . It is simpler to turn to the Worcester transfer , of which there are several fine samples . Robert Hancock , who introduced transfer printing at the Wall pottery , then The House of a Thousand lugs 109 located in the historic Wamstrey House and studied at one time with the French engraver , Ravenet . Worcester of this period shows transfer decoration at its best . Hancock 's many portraits , tea parties , and sporting scenes , have the quality of line engravings . Valentine Green , one of Hancock 's fellow workers at Worcester , later took up mezzotinting and became a member of the Royal Academy . Sadler 's transfer printing is well represented in the many Liverpool jugs , ? rare Washingtons and splendid old ship specimens . Of Worcester jugs in transfer may be mentioned Lord Nelson in portraiture , Frederick the Great , and the calm Charlotte cutting bread and butter . These are too large for the cabinet and line narrow shelves in the dining room , together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apostle Jug and five others in the same general class are taken down from their high estate to be photographed . There is an extensive choice of fine old tables on which they might be placed : Chippendale card , Hepplewhite half-moon , a r o The Quest of the Quaint and many beautiful Sheratons . A dropleaf card table in the parlor is finally selected in order to secure a picture of the paper which has been on the walls for fifty years . This is but yesterday as the contents of the house go , but the pattern is interesting , and its many shades of gray make a delightful background . Here a little later is placed a group of Lowestoft , including the Mandarin creamer , and here , for the pleasure of arranging and rearranging , are marshalled the copper and silver lusters . The latter , in combination with the black beauties of the cabinet , make a striking group against the gray paper . Jackfield is almost a luster in brilliancy , while the softer tones of " Egyptian " ware are very effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early name for his black ware . Soon the word " Egyptian " was dropped , and " Basaltes " , more descriptive of its composition , adopted . Oxide of iron gave to this pottery its ebony tone , and for a long time the secret remained at Etruria . Wonderful as are the jaspers , there is something about The House o f a Thousand rugs I I I the black basaltes. in tone and texture , which , to a few collectors at least , is far more beautiful . On purely technical grounds , perhaps , the laurels should go to " jasper dip " , and yet it is not easy to say in which particular achievement Wedgwood was greatest . The work of this remarkable man is so extensive and varied that it can be realized and appreciated only when its many phases are studied and compared . Such a collection as the Gunsaulus in Chicago gives one a new reverence , not alone for the genius of this master potter but for what the skill of mortal man can accomplish . All China collectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of lost opportunities , the golden chances passed by and realized too late . With every fine bit of Wedgwood comes to my mind the picture of a tea set of raven hue , exquisite in its purity of line , exquisite in its delicate ornament . Garlands and arabesques in pale green and corn color are modeled in low relief upon the dark surface . In the British Section of Varied Industries at the St. 1 12 The Quest of the Quaint Louis Exposition , in a suite of eighteenthcentury rooms , designed and furnished by the historic firm of Waring and Gillow of London , dwelt with other beautiful things in pottery and porcelain this lovely service . In the closing days of the Exposition it was offered for sale at a figure which must have been lower by far than the original selling price . Quite regretfully I replace the three basaltes , first the little strawberry creamer and next two graceful urn-shaped jugs similar to miniature Greek vases . All the while , the many clocks in the house are ticking away the hours . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they strike together and on time . The tall English clocks and the American shelfclocks and the hanging clocks peal forth together . Then it is as if a dozen or more old music boxes suddenly came to life . You may count the hour with Willard , or Terry , or Thomas , or Jerome , or with several of the big English makers . You may choose painted ships or full moons , plain or decorated dials , straight-tops , or The House of a Thousand lugs 113 round-tops , or bonnet-tops . You may choose a different clock for every hour of the day and not exhaust the supply , and if my theme were not jugs , this chapter might have been called , " At the Sign of the Swinging Pendulum . " CHAPTER IX THOMAS HANCOCK 'S CLOCK AND OTHER MATTERS THOMAS HANCOCK , uncle of the man who once signed an important document in letters large enough for George III to read without spectacles , had a keen appreciation of wall papers , gardens , and clocks , which means that had he lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape architect . As it is we know him best as a " patriot . " Of many letters which relate to the furnishing of Thomas Hancock 's house ? that stately edifice on Beacon Street demolished in 1863 to make room for a brownstone mansion ? is a characteristic one about a walnut clock . Another and longer letter is devoted to wall paper . I // quote the latter first , so that the tall clock may have the proper setting . " Sir ? Inclosed you have the Dimensions of a Room for a Shaded Hanging to be Done after the Same Pattern I have Sent per Capt . Tanner , who will Deliver it to you . It 's for my own House , &; Intreat the favour of you to Get it Done for me , to Come Early in the Spring , or as soon as the nature of the Thing will admitt .

Io wh. will meet with Due Honour . " What a pity that this gay paper of birds and monkeys , squirrels and peacocks Thomas Hancock 's Clock i 17 does not exist to-day . It greatly pleased Dorothy Q. when she came to the house a bride , and doubtless Thomas Hancock liked it immensely , for he ordered it for several rooms . To-day only a bronze tablet remains to tell the tale of all that Thomas planned so skilfully , and not a word of credit is given to him . John , his nephew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many other things , is given all the glory . To be sure he inherited the house and lived there for years and was an important person . Moreover he married Dorothy Quincy . Still Thomas , by all that 's fair , should not be forgotten . The clock letter is brief : " Let the time piece be of the newest fashion with a good black Walnut Tree case , veneered work , with dark lively branches on the top instead of balls . Let there be three handsome carved Figures , Gilt with burnished Gold . I 'd have the case without the figures to be ten feet long , the price not to exceed 20 Guineas and as it is for my own use I beg your particular care in buying of it at Cheapest Rate . " 1 1 8 The Quest of the Quaint Thomas Hancock did not mean to be led into wild extravagance , although in the latest fashion he fully intended to be . Whether his Walnut Tree clock is still in this world of things , I do not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood in the old Lawrence - room of the Museum of Fine Arts , Boston . The top showed three balls , not dark lively branches , and there were no gilt figures burnished with gold ; in fact , none of the things insisted upon by Thomas . But it was a clock of distinction and possibly more valuable than the one that could not exceed in cost the sum of " zo Guineas . " Visitors to the present Museum miss the informal and somewhat incongruous arrangement of the former Lawrence room ; the Henry II armor , the Boulle cabinet , the Flemish carvings , the German press , the Dutch chair , and the tall clock with the lacquered case over which were scattered small Chinese mandarins , pagodas , bridges , etc . Gone are the clock , the armor , and the press . The cabinet remains , also the beautiful Flemish carvings . Gone is the Nubian // boy of ebony hue holding back the crimson curtain . The wonder should be , perhaps , that this assemblage held together so long . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regret its passing . The clock was loaned to the Museum and later withdrawn by the owner . Aside from its association with the Hancocks , it is extremely interesting . The case shows the " Chinese " taste so fashionable in London in the middle of the eighteenth century . Marmaduke Storr was the maker , a well-known clock designer in the Strand . In accordance with the practice of the day , Storr abbreviated his first name , using only the first syllable . A curious story in connection with this signature was long current about the clock . It was said to have been made and sold from a shop near London Bridge , owned by a woman whose name appeared on all her clocks ? " Marro Storr . " Tall clocks were made in England about 166o and are associated with the name of Thomas Tompion ? one of the famous clock men of his time . The Clockmakers ' Company in London became a powerful 1 20 The Quest of the Quaint organization in the period following the Restoration . Clockmaking , in connection with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accession of Charles II , more peaceful conditions prevailed , and clock designing entered a period of great prosperity . Hanging clocks go back to an earlier date . They were constructed with long exposed weights , a " bob " pendulum , a square dial made of brass , and an ornamental case surmounted by a dome containing chimes and a strike attachment . They were fastened to the wall by means of a metal guard or plate , which bore the outlines of a lantern . The " bob " pendulum was short and flew back and forth at the sides " in the manner of a shuttle . " When the hanging pendulum was invented , a different style of clock naturally followed . Among the most highly prized of the old hanging clocks were the Friesland patterns , imported from the northern district of Holland . The guard plate was usually in the form of two mermaids painted in gay colors , and there were interesting Thomas Hancock 's Clock I2I side ornaments in characteristic Dutch style . Unlike English and French " lanterns " , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat the appearance of a Swiss cuckoo clock . The invention of the hanging pendulum was the indirect cause of tall clockmaking . While weights were little affected by exposure , so delicate a piece of mechanism as a pendulum needed protection . The first tall clocks were made with a long case , the dial retaining many features of the lantern timepieces . With the adoption of this style , an entirely different scheme of construction sprang into existence . The clock became a piece of furniture and was considered worthy of the cabinetmaker 's consideration . Early cases had the straight cornice seen on cupboards and high chests of drawers . The design was plain , dignified , and very architectural . If rather ponderous , it was , on the other hand , finely executed , and to a few minds more attractive than the types which succeeded it ? although less famous . Most of the clocks found in this country are of the later period , 12 2 The Quest of the Quaint when the scroll top had replaced the straight cornice , and when ornamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were of brass , and the dialplate was square . When the arched dialplate came into existence , there was scope for ornament over the clock face ; and full moons , vessels with flying sails , and other devices came into fashion . The character of the dial is a means of identification . Most of the English clock makers signed their work , but dates were seldom added . Mr. Lockwood , who has done for America what Litchfield has for England , makes some interesting classifications in regard to dial ornaments . The corner devices ? " spandrels " ? have been divided into three general classes . The earliest were heads of cherubs with outstretched wings ; next followed cherubs supporting crowns , and later came more complicated heraldic ornaments . Brass dials continued in popularity until painted and enameled dials replaced them . The style of clock best known to fame , most eagerly sought by collectors , most // often reproduced , is the style that became popular in America from 1745 to 1800 . It has a scroll top , with two brass finials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face is ornamented in divers ways , a moon in the various phases of full , half , and quarter being one of the most popular decorations . Another but less well-known device shows a painted ship upon a painted ocean . The ship , usually a full-rigged brig or frigate , moves back and forth with every movement of the pendulum . The tick is loud but musical . " Forever ! never ! never ? forever , " it repeats over and over , and has for more than a century . This type has been copied fairly well , but no modern clock maker can reproduce the tick . Time has something to do , perhaps , with the slow rhythmical tones of old clocks . A new clock that never goes is only half a clock ; an old clock is even less . If it be as erratic as Captain Cuttle 's watch , it should be wound regularly , for its tick and strike are not of this workaday world . It was in the early part of the nineteenth century when the timepiece that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tall clock , which in various forms had long been the accepted type , was now replaced by a lighter design . Houses were more plentifully furnished , and space was becoming a consideration . The tall clock was expensive . The amount of wood needed for its construction and the time spent in the making rendered the finished article comparatively costly . The Willards grasped the situation and launched the new design at what may truthfully be called a timely moment . The honor of perfecting the banjo design has been variously awarded to Aaron , Benjamin , and Simon . Benjamin had shops in Grafton , Boston , and Roxbury , and was a man of considerable means ; Aaron worked chiefly in Boston ; and the two Simons , father and son , assisted Benjamin , later going into partnership . Old banjos have been found with printed labels bearing " S. Willard " , " Willard , Jr . " , " Aaron Willard " , and " B. Willard . " Simon applied for the earliest patent , under the title of " an improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Clock t 25 been stated that a clock in the House of Parliament gave the idea to the Willards , but this has been denied by several furniture authorities . If they were not the originators of the design , they at least gave it American parentage and have been so long associated with the type that it is too late now to rob them of the honor . Like the Martins of France , their fame has come down as a family . Many collectors rank Simon , Jr. , first ; others prefer the work of Aaron or Benjamin . The type that followed the banjo and long remained popular was the shelf clock , associated preeminently with Connecticut makers . Among this group , Seth Thomas , Eli Terry , Epafphroditus Peck , Chauncey Jerome , and Silas Hoadley are notable names . In 1815 , Terry sold his place of business in Plymouth , Connecticut , to Seth Thomas , whose name is a household word in his native state . Clock makers were proud of their craft and continued it from generation to generation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Peck and Thomas 12 6 The Quest of the Quaint families had a similar record . Massachusetts claims the Willards , but Connecticut produced many of the famous clock-men of the nineteenth century . Terry made many ornamental designs in which carving and fine brass work were conspicuous . The Jerome and Thomas styles , as a rule , were plainer and consequently less expensive . They are faithful timekeepers to-day in many Connecticut households . The Jerome type usually measures about twenty-two inches in height and ten in width , with a case of mahogany veneer . Below the dial is a picture painted on the back of the glass and touched up with gilt . The perspective is rather shaky , as if the artist were unequal to painting the landscape wrong side out . Churches of remarkable architecture , houses of queer dimensions , wonderful trees and birds are found on these clocks . The Willards seldom painted landscape , contenting themselves with a full-rigged ship or the American coat-of-arms , both of which were well drawn and beautifully colored . Much of the charm of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absent . The dials of the shelf clocks are usually well drawn and sometimes well decorated . Terry often used Arabic figures , ? in fact , between 1825-1840 , Roman numerals were less popular than Arabic . An interesting fact pertaining to Roman dials is that the fourth hour is usually painted IIII . Modern clock faces are often thus engraved . Ask nine people out of ten how the figure four is designated on a clock or watch , and they will invariably answer , " Why , in the usual way , of course , like any numeral , IV , " all of which proves how unfamiliar we are with the most familiar things . And the garden letter of Thomas Hancock is still unrecorded : " Sir ? On the Same ship with my clock , my Trees and Buds pr . Capt . Bennett Came Safe to hand and I like them very well . I Return you my hearty Thanks for the Plumb Tree and Tulip Roots you were pleased to make me a present off , which are very Acceptable to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memo . to procure for me 2 or 3 Doz .

" CHAPTER X A PORTSMOUTH PILGRIMAGE THOMAS BAILEY ALDRICH has said that Portsmouth is rich in graveyards . He might have added with equal truth , " and in beautiful old dwellings . " Time has dealt kindly with this quaint town by the sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were in the days of good King George , and the fortunate stranger within the Portsmouth gates feels that the calendar has been turned back a hundred and fifty years . Where shall one begin in the colonial pilgrimage ? Which iron gate , which stately portico , which broad threshold , shall be the first ? The Langdon mansion and the home of Governor John Wentworth are just at hand ; the Warner house is just around a most inviting corner . And 13o The Quest of the Quaint beyond these are more houses still . The day is not long enough for them all , and time is too precious to waste in indecision . The Warner house has nearly completed its second century . It wears its years gracefully , yet with great dignity . The warm tones of the brick , the high pitch of the roof , and the finely proportioned doorway promise a goodly interior . The Warner house shall be first . There is one moment of hesitation before the brass knocker is lifted . Suppose there should be a modern wall paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door has opened , and suppositions are unnecessary . The problem of hall paper will never perplex the inmates of this old house , for the wall is paneled from floor to ceiling . The white paint of this fine woodwork has the ivory tones which come with age , and which no enameling can give . After the sunshine outside , the hall seems very dark . Against the shadowy background is the suggestion of an imposing staircase . Through open doors are glimpses of family portraits . When the parlor shutters are opened , the // staircase is revealed in all its beauty . Of carving there is none . In such modern houses as the Langdon mansion , built 178o , there is a wealth of carving ? but not here . This old pile harks back to the year 1718 and is proud of its simplicity . The staircase has other claims to our interest , aside from the fact that it is a perfect specimen of its type . Ascending its broad steps , our eyes rest on the most remarkable wall decoration of which Portsmouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the plaster are life-size figures of men and women ? allegorical , biblical , and otherwise . Doubtless in the mind of the artist there was some subtle connection between these figures , but we of to-day can not grasp it . Governor Phipps is here , resplendent in yellow and scarlet ; Abraham and Isaac arc , perhaps , the chief characters in the panorama , ? if such it may be called , ? but more interesting are the Indians in full war costume and women in Grecian dress , carding wool at colonial spinning-wheels . Spirited as to drawing and brilliant as to color , they defy time and the spectator . 13 2 The west of the Quaint " Look at us carefully , " they seem to say , " for you will never see our like again . " Long ago ? about sixty years , which is not long for Portsmouth ? these curious people were brought to light after more than half a century of oblivion . Buried beneath four layers of wall paper , their existence was unknown to the occupants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a slight repair in the wall , torn away a fragment of this heavy coating , their presence might still be a secret . Governor Phipps was first discovered , then Isaac , next one of the Indians , and finally all the figures stood revealed to the astonished household . How long they had been painted , how long they had been concealed , no one knew . Were they placed there by order of the man who built the house , Captain Macphaedris , or did some later tenant employ a local artist ? The oldest inhabitant could offer no solution , and thus they remain to-day a baffling bit of mystery . Captain Archibald Macphaedris , a Scotchman , and member of the King 's Council , came to Portsmouth in the early // eighteenth century . He established an iron industry at Dover and engaged in an extensive fur trade with the Indians . Already a man of means , he rapidly amassed a fortune . Not content with the wooden dwellings of the town , he sent to Holland for bricks and tiles with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter of Governor John Wentworth . Several years were consumed in the building , and when completed , it was the finest house of its day in Portsmouth . Among many comfortable dwellings , there was none so substantially built , or so generously furnished . There was a hint of Dutch sturdiness in the pitch of the roof and the high brick chimneys , suggesting that the owner had imported Dutch ideas with his tile and bricks . The interior was patterned after the rooms which the gallant captain had known in the old country . To-day , after a period of two hundred years , the house holds its own bravely and must still be conceded the most picturesque place in Portsmouth . By one of those little ironies of life , the name of the man whose // wealth and brain built the house is seldom associated with it . The Honorable Jonathan Warner married the captain 's daughter , and it is his name that clings to the old pile . Among the portraits in the parlor is that of Mary Macphaedris Warner . Faded a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she still charms with her painted smile . Surrounding this eighteenth century maid are several people whom she knew in life , ? women in brocade and velvet , and officers in wigs and gold lace . The Warner coat-of-arms decorates the narrow mantel shelf , and by its side is that of the Sherburne family . In the early nineteenth century , the house passed , by inheritance , into the hands of Colonel John Sherburne , an honored name in Portsmouth annals . The parlor , with its beautiful paneling , quaint blue tiles , and fine furniture , is a pleasant place in which to linger , and we leave it with reluctance . But across the hall is a room which can not be ignored . Paneled from floor to ceiling , this spacious // apartment has the charm of the rest of the house . On one side of the fireplace , tiled in brown , is a cupboard deftly concealed in the paneling . Upon deep shelves are the silver and china of many Warners and Sherburnes , beautiful old pieces that are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment and then quickly hidden from view . Through traceried doors of a great mahogany cupboard may be seen curious shells and bits of pink and red coral brought home by some seafaring Sherburne . The light comes in dimly through the halfclosed white shutters and touches with a ghostly hand the dark mahogany furniture , the silver candlesticks upon the mantel , and the high brass andirons on the hearth . There is something eerie about it all , and for a moment the present slips into the past . All old houses are full of ghosts , and there arc many in these paneled rooms . Some one has opened the great door in the rear of the hall , and the garden and distant landscape are seen as through a frame . It is a glimpse of the outside world that brings us back to the present . Beautiful 13 6 The Quest of the Quaint old house ! Would that we could carry away every brick and stick and stone . On quiet Pleasant Street is a fine mansion that is a trifle impatient of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel John Langdon soon after the War of the Revolution and is a beautiful specimen of the late eighteenth-century type . Outwardly it resembles the work of Samuel McIntire , the great Salem architect . It stands back from the street and is partly concealed by the heavy foliage of fine old trees . A high fence shuts out the outside world and bids modern Portsmouth , what little there is of it , not to encroach upon its borders . There is an aloofness about the old house quite lacking in the Warner home . It seems to challenge the visitor and to demand the name of at least one great-grandfather . If you have the necessary great-grandfather , you need no other passport ; the door that opened long ago to admit Washington and Lafayette will graciously swing wide for you . The owners of this old house are most hospitable : they were never known to turn // away the humblest stranger . It is the old house itself that is so stiff on the subject of family tree . Or is it simply a bit of imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trifle awed by the thought of the illustrious ones who have knocked at its door ? Famous for its good cheer , the Langdon mansion harbored many guests whose names still shed a faint glory . Few visitors of note came to Portsmouth who did not stay with Colonel Langdon . If they tarried in town for a few hours only , they seldom went away without breaking bread with him . If they dined at the William Pitt tavern , they repaired to the Langdons ' for tea . The Langdon tea and the room in which it was brewed are mentioned in several journals . In 1782 , the Marquis de Chastellux , a major general serving under the Count Rochambeau , came to Portsmouth . In his diary he writes : " After dinner we went to drink tea with Mr. Langdon . He is a handsome man and of noble carriage ; he has been a member of Congress , and is now one of the first people in the country . I lis house is elegant and well furnished , and 13 8 The Quest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his wife , is young , fair , and tolerably handsome , but I conversed less with her than with her husband , in whose favor I was prejudiced from knowing that he had displayed great courage and patriotism at the time of Burgoyne 's expedition . " This was written three years after Burgoyne 's defeat , when the memory of John Langdon 's stirring speech , delivered before the battle , was ringing in the ears : " I have a thousand dollars in hard money , " he said ; " I will pledge my plate for three thousand more ; I have seventy hogsheads of Tobago rum , which will be sold for the most they will bring . They are at the service of the state . Our friend Stark may be safely intrusted with the honor of the enterprise , and we will check the progress of Burgoyne . " John Langdon was five times governor of his State and the recipient of many other political honors . In 181z , the nomination of vice-presidency of the United States was offered him , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made // the Langdon house his Portsmouth headquarters . In 1789 , Washington wrote in his diary : " There are some houses in Portsmouth , among which Col. Langdon 's may be esteemed first . " An item of greater interest reads : " Drank tea with Mrs. Langdon and a large circle of ladies . " The room in which Washington , Lafayette , the Marquis de Chastellux , and other notables drank their tea still retains its fine wainscoting , its arched doorways , and carved mantel . It is as beautiful now as it was a hundred years ago and has the additional charm that comes with age . We do not wonder , as we walk through the rooms , that the house won the admiration of Louis Philippe , who was entertained here when a youth , in company with his two brothers , the Ducs de Montpensier Beaujolais . Years later , when a Portsmouth belle was presented at the French court , she was asked by Louis if this mansion of the brave Governor Langdon were still in existence . The beauties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is late in // the afternoon when we pass down the tesselated walk , through the iron gate , and out into the street . St. John 's church is near at hand , and a glimpse of its interior will be fitting close to the day . No house holds quite the interest of this old church , so close identified with the history of the town . Of the first Episcopal chapel in Portsmouth , no exact date is given , but it is known that the majority of the early settlers belonged to the Church of England . Captain John Mason , one of the founders of the Piscataqua Plantation , sent from England the first communion plate and first prayer books used in the settlement . Nearly one one hundred years later , in 1732 , Queen 's Chapel was erected on the site of the present church . The chapel was named in honor of Queen Caroline , who acknowledged the tribute by presenting the parish with two carved mahogany chairs and a silver communion service . The chairs were placed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period , the pew was reserved for distinguished guests , and to-day " the chair in which Washington sat " is pointed out to us. // In 18o8 , the chapel was destroyed by fire , and a picturesque landmark was lost to Portsmouth . The new church did not retain the old name , but the Queen 's memory is perpetuated in the beautiful altar service and one of the chairs ? presumably the one which the father of his country honored . The silver service is of the fine eighteenthcentury period , when designs were still extremely simple . The tall flagons are very graceful and are engraved with the royal arms . The church is full of relics , which a kind Providence preserved from the flames , the bell , perhaps , being the most remarkable of them all . It was rescued from the belfry by the brave youth of Portsmouth , but its beautiful tone was gone , and it was recast by Paul Revere . This is only part of its history . It was captured at the siege of Louisburg by the officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Sir William Pepperell in 1745 . The bell was an old one even then , having been sent over from France in the previous century . Cast in relief is this inscription in Latin : " I am // the voice of life . I call you . Come . Pray . " Another trophy of war , which may barely be seen in the gathering twilight , is the baptismal font . It is too dark to decipher the long Latin inscription , and it is simpler to read the quaint translation : " Sarah Catherine and Ann Elizabeth , accomplished daughters of Captain John Tufton Mason , generously gave this Baptisterium , acquired from the French at Senegal , under the auspices of the above mentioned John , to the English Church at Portsmouth , in the year of our Lord 1761 , and the 26th of the preaching of Arthur Browne . Wyseman Clagett and Samuel Livermore , Wardens . " Every name in this inscription suggests an interesting biography . Captain John Tufton Mason was a descendant of the original John Mason . Wyseman Clagett was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Rev. Arthur Browne was rector of Queen 's Chapel for thirty-seven years , and during that period christened , married , and buried the quality // of Portsmouth . It was he who performed the ceremony when Governor Wentworth wedded his pretty housemaid , Martha Hilton , a circumstance which Longfellow relates in one of the " Tales of the Wayside Inn . " The Rev. Arthur was a most reluctant participant in this affair , and " disobeyed the voice of conscience " rather than incur the wrath of the stormy bridegroom . But this story can not be told away from its setting the council chamber of the Wentworth mansion at Little Harbor , some two miles distant . It must wait for another day and another pilgrimage . CHAPTER XI AN OLD MANSION BY THE SEA THE history of the Wentworth family is so interwoven with the annals of Portsmouth that it is impossible to study the one without becoming deeply interested in the other . The town is full of old houses once occupied by distinguished Wentworths , and it is a bold tourist who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genealogical puzzles , the history of this illustrious family , in three volumes , is recommended . The Wentworth habit of marrying Wentworths makes a tangled family tree . After the fifth generation , the branches are so twisted that no one save a Wentworth can straighten them out , and even then it is difficult to locate correctly the innumerable Johns . In the family book there are An Old Mansion by the Sea 145 a hundred and forty plain Johns and twice as many where John is used with a middle name , making John Wentworth a worthy rival of John Smith . There is an ancient rhyme with the jingle of Old King Cole that runs : " On the Wentworth tree Were Governors three And three ? brave men were they . " The governors three were John Wentworth , his son Benning , and his grandson , John the second . The " first governor John " , to use a Portsmouth phrase , lived on Pleasant Street , not far from where Colonel Langdon subsequently built his house ; the third of the Wentworth governors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town ; but Benning , the most renowned of the family and the most picturesque figure of his generation , chose Little Harbor , two miles away , as the place of his abode . The three houses are still standing and are full of associations . Historic interest fairly oozes from every door knob . The lover of old houses , old furniture , and old china is // seized with a desire to have them all and spend his remaining days in each . But if only one may be acquired , it must be the rambling old structure at Little Harbor , so near the sea that it suggests a line in one of Aldrich 's poems , " Like to a heron with one foot in stream . " Aldrich did not say this of the Wentworth house : he wrote it in Wyndham Towers , with no thought of Portsmouth in his mind , but it fits the old mansion as if made for it . Outwardly the house is picturesque rather than beautiful . It hardly justifies Longfellow 's description , being too irregular for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect . It can not compare in dignity with the finely proportioned Warner and Langdon houses , or with the Sparhawk homestead at Kittery , designed by Sir William Pepperrell and presented to his daughter at the time of her marriage to Nathaniel Sparhawk . Benning Wentworth was his own architect , a fact which accounts for many of the oddities of the house . The setting of the An Old Mansion by the Sea 147 old pile is charming , with its combination of trees and rocks , of green lawn and shining sand . This blending of country and seashore is characteristic of the New Hampshire coast , and no one grasped its possibilities better than Governor Benning . Viewed from the entrance to the driveway , the house appears to be surrounded with low , wooded hills . No hint of the sea is given . On nearer approach , the hills assume the shape of distant promontories separated from the mainland by a wide expanse of sea . Very attractive at all times are the sea and the hills , but particularly so on a . June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sapphire , and the hills deep emerald . This is the day to choose for a pilgrimage . Vines and flowering shrubs soften the lines of the old house and make it a veritable garden spot . The Wentworth mansion has been fortunate in its occupants . It has not changed hands many times , neither has it been altered to conform to modern standards of living . It was in the year 1750 that Governor Benning first lighted a blaze in the // mammoth fireplace of the council chamber and invited all his friends to a colonial house-warming and in the early part of the nineteenth century it was still in the possession of his family . From a Wentworth it passed into the hands of Charles Cushing , Esq. , and from his descendant it was purchased by Mr. John Templeman Coolidge , Jr. , of Boston . It is now occupied only in the summer and fall . On late October days the great fireplace roars as of yore , and Wentworth hospitality is still maintained . Whatever may be said of the architecture of this old structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real storybook house , full of unexpected stairways , secret passages , and hidden corners . No two of the main rooms are on the same level ; you go down a few steps to reach one apartment , up a short flight to enter another , and through a narrow passageway to gain a third . Without a guide it is quite bewildering , and the visitor is apt to wander around in a circle and unexpectedly return to his starting-place . The house is An Old Mansion by the Sea 149 as full of odd nooks and crannies as the brain of the governor was of odd crotchets . According to the diary of a relative , no one could tell what whim would next seize the fancy of Benning Wentworth . He was always doing the unexpected ? a fact which makes his marriage to Martha Hilton extremely consistent and so characteristic a bit of folly as to scarcely warrant the surprise of his friends . The story of this romantic wedding has been told many times ; how pretty Martha Hilton left quarrelsome Dame Stayers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mansion ; how the governor a few years later gave a banquet and invited all his friends ; how , when the dinner was over , the host turned to the Rev. Arthur Browne and said : " This is my birthday ; it shall likewise be my wedding-day and you shall marry me ; " how Martha , unnoticed by the guests , entered the room dressed in all the finery of a great lady ; how the rector protested , and the governor stormed , and how the confusion was finally ended by the bridegroom 's shouting : ' so The west of the Quaint " As the chief magistrate of New England , I command you to marry me . " This oft-repeated story owes much of its popularity to Longfellow , who wove the scene into one of the " Tales of a Wayside Inn . " Of the company at the banquet he mentions " The Pepperells , the Langdons and the Lears , the Sparhawks , the Penhallows and the rest . But why repeat the name of every guest ? " Among the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sherburnes , the Sheafes , the Warners , the Cuts , the Atkinsons , the Pickerings , and many Wentworths . Hasty second marriages were not uncommon in the governor 's family . The Rev. Arthur Browne was summoned a little later to attend a town wedding that was even more disturbing . A month before he had conducted a funeral service at the house where a distinguished Wentworth had passed away , leaving a disconsolate widow . When the good rector was summoned , he hastened to obey , supposing that his prayers and sympathy were requested . As he approached the dwelling , the An Old Mansion by the Sea 151 brilliantly lighted interior gave him a slight misgiving . Guests in gala attire were arriving , and through the window he could discern Madam Wentworth in brocade and jewels . By her side was a kinsman of the late departed , arrayed in glittering regimentals . The house of mourning had been turned into a house of rejoicing . Reluctant to enter and yet not daring to take refuge in flight , the poor man sought madam 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirth . How madam overcame the rector 's scruples and how the ceremony proceeded are matters of local history . But the end had not yet come for the rector . As he descended the steps , whether owing to a disturbed conscience or to his uncertainty as to what might happen next , he lost his balance and plunged headlong to the sidewalk below . During the period of enforced idleness that followed this mishap , he had time for many reflections and doubtless realized how precarious was the path of one who tried to serve both God and Mammon . The new Lady Wentworth of Little Harbor filled her position gracefully and I 5z The Quest of the Quaint carried her head as high as though born to the purple . When she rode into town with all the bravery of a coach and four , she instructed her coachman to pass the Halifax tavern . The deep curtsy of Mistress Stayers was no doubt as gratifying to the lady in the coach as it was galling to the dame at the door . The slights of many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Benning Wentworth 's commission as governor expired in 1767 , and he was succeeded by his nephew John . Three years later Martha was left a widow and sole owner of the Little Harbor estate . After a brief period of mourning , she married Michael Wentworth , a retired officer in the English army . Their only daughter followed the family custom and wedded a Wentworth , John by name , a nephew of the third governor . " Once a Wentworth , always a Wentworth " seems to have been the family motto . The Wentworth way of marrying Wentworths has been explained on the ground that once having borne that name no one wanted to relinquish it . An Old Mansion by the Sea 153 To be a Wentworth in Portsmouth is like being a Biddle in Philadelphia , and when this is understood nothing more need be said on the subject . Standing before the huge fireplace in the council chamber , the visitor is forced to admit that Benning Wentworth built wisely . His house , in spite of its shortcomings , has outlived many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century . The mantelpiece is as clear cut as if just from the workman 's chisel , and is more richly carved than was common in New England houses of the period . The proportions are excellent , and quite in keeping with the lofty dimensions of the room . The walls are a deep yellow , which harmonizes with the white woodwork and old mahogany furniture . Many of the pieces were used by Benning Wentworth and his lady and have never been removed from their original setting . In one corner are the old guns , and at the entrance door are the ancient racks where once were placed the muskets of the governor 's guard . At one time the portraits in the council chamber formed a // worthy collection , which people journeyed to see . When the mansion passed out of the hands of the Cushing family , these old pictures were removed and are now in the possession of Miss Cushing , who lives near the old house . An early photograph shows a portrait of Mrs. John Hancock by Copley , and a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an American diplomat . The fame of this lofty chamber has somewhat overshadowed that of the other rooms . The parlor , with its quaint wall paper ordered by the governor from a London firm , is in a fine state of preservation . The color has long since faded out of the background of the paper , but the design is clear , and not unlike recent English patterns . Upstairs in a spacious chamber , where the paper is the same , the walls have been restored . The background is a deep chrome , and the figure in soft grays and browns is most effective . The old billiard room shows signs of age more than any of the other apartments . The floors are uneven , and the once green An Old Mansion by the Sea 155 and pink wall paper has faded to a misty gray . This room is so near the water that the visitor has the feeling of being at sea , an impression that is heightened by the uneven floors and the sagging windows . From this apartment open small card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aroma of colonial punch still lingers . In the dining room of the house is a notable collection of blue china , old prints , and pewter . The paper here is new , but has been chosen with a due regard to the demands of the room . It is a pictorial design in blue and affords a good setting for Staffordshire and willow ware . The attic and cellar of this historic mansion must have their passing word . In the upper part of the house are many small compartments once used by the governor 's slaves , and in the cellar are an equal number of compartments , somewhat more commodious , where once were quartered the governor 's horses . From top to bottom the old pile is full of interest , and a long June day is quite too short in which to do it justice . CHAPTER XII SIR WILLIAM 'S STAIRCASE Not far from the Wentworth mansion at Little Harbor stands the Sparhawk house at Kittery Point , which New Hampshire can not claim . It was built by William Pepperrell , the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of her marriage to Nathaniel Sparhawk , in 1742 . The Granite State is rich in old dwellings and does not quarrel with fate for locating this fine specimen of Colonial architecture just across the Maine line . The house is near enough to Portsmouth to be a part of its old-time atmosphere , and to geographical boundaries the average pilgrim is indifferent . The house was built about the time of the Benning Wentworth mansion and is a connecting link between the Warner and Langdon dwellings . Old houses are hypnotic . The one you // are in is always the most fascinating ; for a moment the others fade into the background . To decide which old place in this part of New England is the most interesting is a far harder task than the one that confronted Paris in the famous contest with the apple . The exterior of one , the hall of another , the parlor of a third , the dining room of a fourth come to mind and make a decision impossible . If the Warner house has the wall decorations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house the fireplace , the Sparhawk house has the staircase . Sir William 's staircase , it should be called , for it was he who drew every spindle , thus proving himself as great a master with the draughting-board as with the musket . To-day the hall of the Sparhawk house stands as it was originally planned . The staircase is intact , the wall paper is the same , the furniture is unchanged . The only discordant notes in the picture are modern visitors in modern clothes who go up and down the staircase . No powdered hair , no queues , no patches , no rustling brocades , 15 8 The Quest of the Quaint no glint of gold lace mark these pilgrims , and , it must be added , no old-time grace of mien and speech . The only drawback to life in a colonial mansion would appear to be the pilgrims ? the never-ending summer procession of people who lift the big brass knocker , timidly or boldly as the case may be , and ask to " see the house . " A courtesy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inmates of these old houses . Something more lasting than the mere charm of old paint and paper is felt by every visitor , for the hospitality extended is as colonial as the furniture . Perhaps Mr. Horace Mitchell , the owner of the Sparhawk estate , voices the sentiments of other householders when he says : " Historic houses are public property . " If the Wentworth mansion has been fortunate in its occupants , the Sparhawk place has also . So perfectly has the building been preserved that restoration , except in a few details , has not been necessary . The plan of the house is that favorite one of colonial designers , a broad hall with // poms on either side . At the right is the parlor , which is of noble proportions , externding the depth of the house . It is paneled from floor to ceiling and contains a fireplace of great beauty . The latter is very plain ; there are no columns , no shelf , no tiles . The beautiful paneling makes any ornament superfluous . Flanking the fireplace are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temper the light and render curtains unnecessary . No draperies conceal the fine woodwork of the windows , and the doors are not marred by portieres . There is a simplicity about the room which is very remote from the twentieth century . William Pepperrell built better than he knew , and in some respects modern architects have not surpassed him . Had he not won fame in other fields , he would be entitled to a few laurel leaves for his work on this house , which is now merely reckoned as one of several achievements . It was the siege of Louisburg that brought fame and knighthood to plain William Pepperrell . This was in 1745 , a few years 1 6 o The Quest of the Quaint after the marriage of his daughter to the Honorable Nathaniel Sparhawk . Pepperrell was a man of simple tastes and cared less for his title than did many of his friends . He occupied an important position in affairs of state and was as unique a personality as Benning Wentworth . The name Pepperrell was spelled in divers ways , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes with all double letters and again with every conceivable combination of double and single letters . There are almost as many variations of Pepperrell as of Shakespeare , and early historians made use of them all . Among the documents extant signed by William Pepperrell is a letter written in 1741 , in the interest of Elizabeth , who was a much petted only daughter . It shows the baronet in a new light and proves that he could plan a lady 's wardrobe as successfully as he could a staircase . " Piscataqua in New England , October 4 . FRANCIS WILLIS , Esq . Sir : Your favor of ye 16th May and 24th June last I received by Captain Prince , for which am Sir William 's Staircase i 6 i much obliged to you . Inclosed you have a receipt for 46 pieces of gold weighing 20 ozs , which will be delivered you , I hope by Robert Noble of ye ship America , which please to receive and credit to my account with , and send my by ye first opportunity for this place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit of clothes , the ground to be white Padusoy and flowered with all sorts of colors suitable for a young woman , another of white watered Taby and Gold Lace for trimming of it , 12 yards of green Padusoy , 13 yards of Lace for a woman 's head dress , 2 inches wide as can be bought for 13 shillings per yard , a handsome Fan with a leather mounting as good as can be bought for about 20 shillings , 2 pair silk shoes and cloggs a size bigger than ye shoes . Your servant to command , WILLIAM PEPPERRELL . " This letter was doubtless an order for a portion of Elizabeth 's trousseau , as her marriage occurred the following June . Mistress Pepperrell was a noted belle and must have made a brave showing in the green padusoy and the white watered taby trimmed with gold lace . Her daughter , Mary Sparhawk , inherited her beauty and in 177o was as great a belle as Elizabeth // had been in 1740 . Many stories are told of the wit and fascination of Nathaniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a passing interest . Charles Warren Brewster , writing in 1850 , says : " If the tale of tradition is true , to the beauty of Mary Sparhawk who became the wife of Dr. Jarvis , Portsmouth is more indebted for its protection in 1775 than to its forts . The story goes that Captain Mowatt of the Canceaux , a British ship of 16 guns , connected with a large armed ship , a schooner and a sloop , were off our harbor in the month of October , 1775 . Captain Mowatt went privately on shore at Kittery Point and was received at the loyal house of Nathaniel Sparhawk . Here he became so much fascinated with Mary that the intent of his voyage to destroy Portsmouth was by her influence changed ; and he made sail for Falmouth , now Portland , and burned more than 400 of the best houses and stores , leaving only about loo of the poorest houses and they much damaged . How much our city is indebted to the beauty of Mary we can hardly estimate . " // Mary Sparhawk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the splendor befitting her father 's station . And this brings us again to the staircase . The ceremony took place at the house , and the wedding party descended the beautiful broad steps built by the bride 's grandfather . Now that a staircase is considered so important a feature of house building , it is interesting to study Sir William 's triumph from the purely architectural side . The beautiful lines of the balustrade , the admirable arrangement of the landings , and the unusual treatment of the spindles combine to produce a very satisfactory result . From every point of view it charms . There are no ugly angles , no uninteresting corners . It pleased Sir William when he designed it , and it pleases the most critical pilgrim to-day . One modern house builder has copied the staircase line for line . At Newcastle , New Hampshire , in the summer home of William Niles , Esq. , of Boston , its beauty has been so faithfully reproduced that Sir William himself would be deceived were he to // return to his old haunts . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he noted the absence of those classic domes and pillars ordered from London , would he realize that he was not in Elizabeth Sparhawk 's house . After his first surprise was over , he could not fail to admire the taste of the man who had so perfectly reproduced his handiwork . CHAPTER XIII THE BOWDOIN PRINT WHERE to open the tale of the Bowdoin print is a bit puzzling , but before going farther , the word " cotton " should be inserted , else something to frame and hang on the wall is suggested . This old print shows garden roses mellowed to the tones of an old tapestry , and in truth , I have seen hundreds of pictures not half so beautiful in color or line . Whether to begin with the little antique shop where the precious yards of roses were purchased and work backwards , or start forth boldly with Elizabeth Bowdoin 's household belongings and come down a hundred and fifty years is a question . The temptation is to begin with Elizabeth . Had I not discovered her portrait one day in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ print might have leading place . As it is , little Elizabeth , in satin frock and lace ruffles , holding a pear in one hand , must come first . With Mistress Elizabeth is her brother the Honorable James , a charming boy in velvet coat , knee breeches , ruffled waistcoat , and silver shoe buckles , ? a miniature edition of his father , Governor Bowdoin . Beyond the children is a landscape background of the type dear to the painters of the eighteenth century . Unfortunately the artist is unknown , so tribute to this quaint canvas must be quite impersonal . The date is unrecorded , but the fact that James graduated from Harvard in 1771 , at the age of nineteen , makes the approximate day comparatively easy to place . Moreover , Elizabeth 's coiffure suggests the seventeen sixties . If this were a serious tale of the Bowdoin family , brother would have to be mentioned first , for his achievements fill pages , while little sister 's history is summed up in a few lines . That she married Sir John Temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most // significant circumstance and quite the most interesting . She died , so runs the family record , in 1809 , four years after James returned from an important diplomatic mission to Spain . Elizabeth 's father was one of the notable figures of his time , ? twice governor of Massachusetts , president of the council which later framed the constitution , trustee of Harvard College , and many other things . The quelling of Shays ' Rebellion in the second term of his office as governor , in 1786 , was one of his important public acts . But these matters do not relate to his daughter 's cotton print . Near Elizabeth 's picture hangs the portrait of the governor as a young man , painted in 1748 by Robert Feke ? that early American artist whose brilliant and romantic career forms an interesting preface to the work of Copley , Stuart , and Trumbull . Very aristocratic of face and bearing is the governor , and lovely indeed the governor 's lady , painted by Feke in the same year . There is a suggestion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quest of the Quaint of Virginia in this portrait of Elizabeth Erving Bowdoin . The gown is pale blue satin , stunningly painted , and in the long slender hands is held a crystal bowl filled with pink roses . Her daughter comes well by the beauty which , as Lady Temple , won for her considerable fame in London . Little Elizabeth is surrounded by Bowdoin kin in paint and canvas . At the extreme left is her uncle , the Honorable William , half brother to the governor , almost as distinguished in face as that worthy and quite as much so in costume . Mrs. William , the beautiful Phoebe Murdock , hangs at his side , adorable in gray satin and white mull , her eighteenth century hands holding a small book , her dark hair rolled back and without powder , after the manner of the period . Then there are the sprightly Judith , sister of the governor , a most captivating person in rose pink and fine lace ; and Elizabeth 's grandfather , James the first , a merchant of vast wealth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1637 , The Bowdoin Print 16 9 sought first the shores of Casco Bay and later the more peaceful settlement of Boston . The portrait of this enterprising Bowdoin is a vigorous piece of brush work from the hand of Joseph Badger . And the very distinguished portrait by Gilbert Stuart of the very distinguished Honorable James , diplomat , must not be forgotten . But this does not end the family portraits nor begin to chronicle the priceless canvases of the room . The Honorable James , founder of Bowdoin College , not only gave six hundred acres of what was then good Massachusetts land , but in addition eleven hundred pounds sterling , the Island of Naushon in Buzzard 's Bay , and his entire art gallery , which included many foreign and American masters . The old etchings alone are worth journeying many miles to see , and if it were not for the beguiling Elizabeth , her stately mother , her beautiful Aunt William , her captivating Aunt Judith , her highly interesting grandfather , her exceedingly important father , and her adorable brother , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would lead I 70 The Quest of the Quaint far away from the cotton print which has already been kept waiting too long . After all , it is a simple circumstance hardly justifying so important an introduction . To come down from governors and diplomats to a mere bedspread is perhaps asking too much . It could not be thought of for a moment if Elizabeth , in selecting her household furnishings , had not given much thought to this particular pattern . How much of the fabric she took to England has not been recorded , but enough remained in the old Bowdoin house to deck half a dozen four-posters . This is a story with a beginning and an end and many blank pages in the center . It is necessary to skip nearly a hundred and fifty years and take up the thread ? which is entirely appropriate for a cotton material ? in a musty , dusty little antique shop just around the corner from Boston 's main thoroughfare . Here one day yards and yards of the faded garden roses were unearthed , together with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Massachusetts ' proudest families . An // auction had recently taken place in the dismantled rooms of an old mansion on Bowdoin Street , and the articles heaped on tables and chairs were the spoils of the junk man . The dwelling had long since passed out of the hands of the original owners , and little of real value had been secured , yet there was something pathetic , humorous , and decidedly incongruous about the circumstance . Most of the battered trophies were found in forgotten drawers and on high shelves , in the cellar , and in the attic . The print was far and away the most interesting of the motley assemblage , and that was in fragments . Yet , in spite of tatters , it was a charming and aristocratic thing in cotton . Much of it had to be discarded , but by piecing and patching , enough was reconstructed to make a covering for a low post bedstead and for curtains at two small windows . Now visitors who pull my latchstring ask first to see the Bowdoin print . Many are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as many collectors are now seeking ? mythological scenes or // early Roman history - not just a long-lost flower garden . It would have pleased me quite as much if Elizabeth had chosen the story of " Telemachus and Calypso " in dull blue or " The Siege of Troy " in mulberry , but it would be as presumptuous to dictate to a Bowdoin as to a Biddle . Besides Elizabeth lived a trifle too soon for the classic revival in cotton goods . Possibly she went shopping in the family coach ; possibly grandfather James imported the material from Lisbon or Calcutta by way of France or England . Who can say at this late day just how the governor 's daughter acquired my window curtains and my low post bedstead counterpane . Possession being nine points in interest , speculations are idle . In addition to Elizabeth 's cotton garden , I possess a dahlia chintz which equals in color the brightest fancy of a seedsman 's catalogue . On Bavarian soil grew this gay pattern , which time seems to make even more brilliant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bowdoin portraits , the story of this old textile might // be related . In the early nineteenth century it covered two armchairs , two long sofas , two small settees , and twelve side chairs . Some day I shall build a room around this chintz . It will be called the " Dahlia Room " , and everything in it from the floor up and from the door knobs down will be planned expressly for this riotous fabric . Until that distant day it remains in an old ship 's chest . Visitors draw it forth occasionally , and several post impressionists have attempted to transplant its vivid orange , true scarlet , deep crimson and clear blue-green to canvas . But the old German dyes are not to be reproduced in modern pigments . On dark days or blue days one of the chair backs is sometimes fastened with thumbtacks to my study wall . Only a confirmed pessimist could hold out long in the face of this joyous thing . Highly prized in colonial times was every scrap of chintz , " patch " and imported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " reads one old document , " three silver // Porringers , a brass Trivet , and seven Lengths of best Lisbon Calicoe . " Portugal fabrics are not so famous now , and it behooves the collector of prints to search for these cottons . Sometimes charming bits are found in New England seaports . A few years ago , when an old house was rebuilt in a Massachusetts coast town , a bundle of calico pieces was found under the eaves in the attic . It was once the property of an aged spinster , long since dead , whose fame for " log-cabin " and " rising-sun " bedquilts was more than local . Tenants had come and gone , and the calicoes were not unearthed until an ambitious occupant decided to put a mansard roof on the building . Then the old pieces , picturesquely tied in a green beige shawl , were brought to light , together with several bandboxes covered with wall paper of most antiquated appearance . The people in the house cared nothing for the shawl , bandboxes , or prints , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who considered them treasures trove . Among the pieces were two Lisbon prints The Bowdoin Prim ' ' 75 ? one with a lavender ground on which pink rosebuds were scattered , the other having a bolder rose design in deeper colors on a very unusual shade of gray-blue . The other fragments were French , English , and early American , and set forth the fashions of the town for a period of sixty years . All showed simple , strong designs and a wealth of color quite absent in modern cottons . There were Manchester calicoes , calicoes from the Merrimac mills of Lowell , and a few bits unmistakably French in design . Whether these prints were all colored with vegetable dyes is a question , but the hard , flat qualities of modern chemicals were entirely lacking . This was particularly noticeable in the greens , the blues , and the deep yellows . The difference between the old and new methods of printing may partly account for the beauty of old cottons . The big factories have not time for the block process . They use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they are run with gigantic machinery that makes a cotton-manufacturing town the busiest , noisiest place in existence . // No textile has a more interesting history than the cotton print . The sacred books of India record the existence of hand-spun and dyed cloth eight hundred years before the birth of Christ . While the Chinese raised cotton as an ornamental plant in the court gardens , and the Egyptians regarded it as sacred , the Hindoos knew and practiced the art of cotton weaving centuries before it was known to the world outside . Persia gained the knowledge , doubtless , from some Indian navigator , and from there it was carried into Turkey and Arabia . China was last of Asiatic countries to adopt the industry but achieved greatest fame . At first only the royal family wore the new fabric . The Emperor Ou-ti ascended the throne in robes of cotton instead of silk . It was not until the invasion of the Tartars that cotton spinning became general and the poorer classes could afford to dress in it . The Greeks were familiar with cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calicut , from the seaport in India by that name . The city of Calicut at // that time was famous for its commerce and its beautiful Brahmin temple . In the temple gardens grew shrubs of purple cotton , tended by the priests . The blossoms were sacred to Brahma , and were woven into altar cloths . The picking of the cotton , the spinning and the dyeing , were a religious ceremonial in which no profane hand could have a part . Calicut was the first Indian city visited by Europeans . In 1498 a Portuguese adventurer , Vasco da Gama , entered the harbor . When he returned to Lisbon , two years later , he gave such glowing accounts of the country that the king of Portugal attempted to conquer India . He sent out three thousand men , who invaded Calicut but were repulsed a few months later . The story of the brief occupancy of India by the Portuguese is not less remarkable than their sojourn in Japan . In the latter country they left behind them the recipe for sponge cake , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailors returned to Lisbon from India but they carried with them a cargo of cotton , three hand // looms , and the art of spinning . Thus Portugal was the earliest of European countries to make cotton prints . Holland followed a hundred years later , gaining her information through the Dutch East India Company . England , now the greatest market of manufactured cotton in the world , knew nothing of the industry until late in the seventeenth century . How long cotton cloth had been made in the western world it is impossible to say , but there is a tradition that Columbus sent a quantity of it to Queen Isabella , and it aroused almost as much curiosity as the natives who bore it . Cortez found the people of Mexico clad in garments that were neither of flax , wool , nor silk , and wrote of the wonderful plant with white blossoms . In comparing old prints of Mexico with those of India , a striking resemblance is seen . Not only are the designs similar , but the colors are much the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a depth and softness unknown in modern cottons. // Collecting these old fabrics is a pleasant pastime . Many of the fragments may be put to actual use ; others are interesting to look over when placed in portfolios . Old cotton prints will never equal in value old laces , yet there is the same personal interest underlying both . CHAPTER XIV QUICKSILVER AND MUCH FINE GILDING IN collecting there are many things which can be assigned to definite periods . Either by their outlines or decoration they proclaim their country and century . There are other articles equally old , which are not easy of identification . They developed on more independent lines , and do not , on first acquaintance , reveal their day and generation . Mirrors are in that class ; also screens ; and the list might be extended to include other articles of furnishings , sometimes termed movable fitments . In hunting old mirrors or , more corectly speaking , old looking-glasses , several styles are encountered which are difficult to place . American Empire specimens , with their straight tops and painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quicksilver and Much Fine Gilding 181 Chippendale and Adam types ; but Sheraton and Hepplewhite designs are sometimes perplexing , while early eighteenth and late seventeenth century examples have been known to baffle well-known curators . Often decorators are in doubt as to the correct mirror treatment of period rooms , particularly when oak styles are under consideration . Yet the fascinations of mirrors arc many , and not the least of their attractions are the interesting questions they sometimes raise . One can really become quite sentimental over a collection of these old articles . What interesting costumes and scenes are brought to mind and almost to view by Charles II mirrors ! If these battered sheets of glass and mercury enclosed in wooden frames could give back their impressions , what valuable commentaries they would be on the life of their times ! Not only of people but of woodwork , furniture , and all those interior fitments which decorators of to-day construct with such infinite pains . Furnishing an interior by the aid of the seventeenth-century mirrors , assisted by 18 2 The Quest of the Quaint imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass darkly . Some of the impressions are wonderfully clear . The costumes are highly attractive . They have a brilliancy of color well tuned to the richness of oak paneling and oak furniture . Perukes are brown , that being the color of the royal wig . We miss a certain distinction found in the dress of the next century , but there is a greater picturesqueness . Turning back the calendar a hundred years , we find a ruder manner of living , but a splendid color note in costumes and background . There is less refinement , but something very fascinating in this Tudor century . Impressions , so far as mirrors are concerned , are a little blurred . There is a tradition that Queen Elizabeth used only such mirrors as made her look young and interesting , that they were prepared especially for her , and that no " true " glass was ever permitted to find its way to her presence . It is a matter of regret that further information is not at hand , some hint of where the glasses were made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Quicksilver and Much Fine Gilding 183 best of all , a formula from which such highly desirable articles could now be manufactured . Perhaps it is useless to try to fathom out just what the mirrors of Elizabeth 's time were like . Possibly they reached Her Majesty from Venice , for that city of glass magicians sent representatives to the English courts . There is not a great deal of information at hand regarding the history and evolution of the looking-glass . Polished steel served during a long period . Next followed the small hand mirror , probably of Venetian origin ; and gradually the wall mirror , as we now know it , came into being . French and Italian mirrors had reached a high degree of beauty long before English designers realized their possibilities . A search for old specimens , even in the big museums , reveals the fact that there are few examples earlier than Charles II 's day . The Stuart types seem to be of two general styles , ? those which are nearly square except for the ornamental top , and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being designed for special // places . It may be doubted if they were a part of the permanent fitments of rooms during the Jacobean period . They were movable , as were most of the really luxurious things of life . So far as the decorative treatments of walls were concerned , French designers of the seventeenth century were far ahead of the English . It was not until the early Georgian period , when Grinling Gibbons and his fellow-workers achieved notable results in the decorative treatments of walls , that mirrors were used in a purely ornamental way . Robert Adam quickly comes to mind when eighteenth-century designers are mentioned ; also Thomas Sheraton . Both used mirrors in a way that Chippendale and Hepplewhite did not attempt , although the detached glasses of the latter men are among the finest things of their kind in existence . Distinctions were carefully made in the eighteenth century . Mirrors were of the convex order , very ornamental ? girandoles , to be exact ? while looking-glasses were more utilitarian , usually long and Quicksilver and Much Fine Gilding 185 narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctions have lost much of their original meaning . We speak of mirrors in a general way , meaning everything in mercury and glass . Many collectors , particularly in this country , call the long and narrow specimens looking-glasses and the horizontal , mantel types , mirrors . Those who are very exact confine the latter term to circular girandoles , but it is only in months of searching that a genuine one is found . Consequently the word may be correctly used only a few times in a year . Meanwhile " mirror " comes easily , far more so than " looking-glass " , which bears out the theory of a certain English connoisseur that American collectors prefer to call their possessions by wrong names . Most of the mirrors picked up in the shops are of the early nineteenth century , when the long rectangular frame with a painted landscape on the top was much in vogue . While these old objects are interesting and often of considerable beauty , they do not equal in value those of an earlier period . i86 The Quest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties are immediately encountered . " Eagle mirrors " belong to one very large class but cover several different types . Chippendale used the eagle in a masterly way , perhaps most successfully in the real girandole mirrors . We also find him using this bird in connection with elaborately carved mirror frames of mahogany , in which the eagle alone is gilded . There are many variations of this theme , one simple type being very well known in this country . Then there are the " Constitution " mirrors , in which the American eagle is used in various ways . Genuine " Constitutions " are valuable and are perhaps as desirable as any eagle mirror that an American collector could have . The real Constitution must not be confounded with that scarce American Empire mirror , the " Constitution and Guerriere . " Such confusion has happened at auction sales , with much attendant annoyance , embarrassment , and amusement . An old looking-glass showing a spirited Quicksilver and Much Fine Gilding 187 painting of this important naval skirmish of the War of 1812 is quite a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in gold . The " picture glass " is nineteenth and seventeenth and occasionally eighteenth century . The cabinetmakers of the latter century used the scheme , though preferring urns and garlands and other typical motifs . It is possible sometimes to determine the maker by the urn . Adam , Sheraton , and Hepplewhite used the urn with great skill . Some of the most charming specimens of the late eighteenth century show this finish . The urn in a lower , broader way is found on Queen Anne specimens . Thomas Sheraton , who was a decorator and upholsterer quite as much as a furniture maker , has given advice about the use of mirrors in relation to wall treatment . Some of Sheraton 's comments are interesting . The following is taken from his book : " In elegant rooms , the chimney-glass is usually carried to the under side of the cornice of the ceiling ; but to reduce the expense of the plate , sometimes a broadish panel is introduced at the top of the glass with a frieze and cornice above all , included in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved pilasters for chimney and pier-glasses are those of reeds , worked bold ; but which , in my opinion , still look better by being parted with a ground one-third of the width of the reed which may be matted to relieve the burnished reeds . It is not unusual to have a twisting branch of flowers , or a ribband round the reeds rising upwards , and terminating in some sort of Composite , Corinthian or Ionic capital . The panel above the glass is sometimes made quite plain and covered with silk as a ground for drapery , tacked under the cornice of the glass to match that of the windows . " " Glasses for chimney-pieces run various , according to the size of the fireplace , and the height of the wall above . To save expense , they are sometimes fitted up in three plates , and the joints of the glass covered with small gilt mouldings or pilasters . At other times with the naked joint only . Quicksilver and Much Fine Gilding 189 When they are of one plate , the frame in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old house in lower New York are four beautiful mirrors representing different periods . A writer of colonial romances once fitted out the house with four ghosts which nightly stepped from the mirrors and wandered at will through the rooms . From the " Bilboa " frame flitted a ghost equipped with all the earmarks of an eighteenth-century story ? powdered queue , lace ruffles , silver shoe buckles , and jeweled snuffbox . This imposing shade was a restless spirit . He had little in common with the gentleman of the French Empire mirror , and still less with the little maid from the Queen Anne looking-glass . With the fourth ghost , an early daughter of the Revolution , who dwelt within the Constitution frame , he was on better terms . By day they all ; took flight , and the most expectant victor saw merely glass and quicksilver , mahogany and walnut , and much fine gold decoration . The " Bilboa " specimen is a remarkably fine one of its class . At the top of the frame , and forming a beautiful finial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the characteristics of the true " Bilboa . " The flowers are wired and quite flexible . The arched top is ornamented with gold , while the frame next the glass is gold lined . Although " Bilboa " is the general name for mirrors of this class , the origin of the word is not very clear . In the seaport towns of New England the term was first applied to looking-glasses brought back from foreign shores . " Bilboa " in the Bay of Biscay was the traditional port from which these beautiful objects came . The first " Bilboas " had other distinguishing features , namely , veneers of marble , etc. , but to-day it is the wired flowers to which collectors pin their faith . Mirrors and clocks fill a middle ground between heavy pieces of furniture and the small objects which fascinate many collectors . They are important accessions in furnishing a house in colonial style . A well placed mirror gives a certain charm to an old-fashioned room that nothing else will , and no dwelling , old or new , is complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XV FRIENDLY FURNITURE MANY people who are not collectors find it hard to resist the charms of old chairs ; also numerous individuals , unmoved by rare mahogany , are greatly attracted by rush and cane . Old rush chairs , for instance , are so friendly and approachable , so entirely comfortable . Windsors alone can compete with them for everyday , hard usage . They are in the same class socially , claiming no drawing-room associations , yet if the truth be told , outlasting many finer types . While rush is often , ? not always , ? plebeian , cane belongs to the aristocracy . " Royalty " is a better word , ? for Charles II , James II , Louis XVI , and other sovereigns come to mind at the mere word " cane " , while " rush " often suggests English cottages and New England farmhouses . 19 2 The Quest of the Quaint Rush furniture comes to us in many guises . It takes the form of old " ladderbacks " found in quantities in New England , of quaint , painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nineteenth century , of fiddle and spoon-back chairs in mahogany and walnut of the early eighteenth century , also of more mixed styles ; lastly it comes in numerous cottage forms of simple design . Old pieces are still to be found , and their charm is undeniable . The dust of countless attics seems to cling to the corners , while invisible cobwebs are plainly seen by the imaginative . In many old houses where rush chairs are not actual " attic properties " , they may be found in the " kitchen " or even the " woodshed " , and no ignominy quite equals the latter status . An attic has picturesque if dusty traditions , but no romance clusters about a New England woodshed . The old rush pieces are now coming once more into their own . Frost and mildew have done their worst ; conditions which would have ruined finer things have // blighted , but not annihilated . Underneath the old paint the wood is well preserved . Possibly the old seats are still intact . If so , soap and water and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far gone for this simple restoration , new seats may be added . No matter how dilapidated , they are well worth rescuing . They may be prizes dating back a century , but the chances are that the woodshed pieces belong to the early nineteenth , when rush in this country and England had a great vogue . Thomas Sheraton in his later days used rush extensively in his cheaper painted pieces . Chairs and settees with rush seats and charmingly decorated frames , believed to be his , are found occasionally in this country and rank with the most interesting things in the painted line which the average collector runs across . The higher grade of painted furniture , combined with cane , is seldom found in the usual avenues of collecting . Many collectors own such pieces , but they have been purchased in the old country or ordered through expensive shops here . This unique and beautiful furniture does // not seem to have been imported to any extent at the time of its origin . It was a costly luxury then and has never been at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate story from rush , with even an older history ? though rush seats go back a long , long way . Occasionally a rush chair of the early seventeenth century is seen ? heavy of design and bearing every indication that the seat is as old as the oak of the frame . This type , found in the museums of New England and the South , and now and then in private collections , is of the early turned variety which followed closely on the all oak or " wainscot chair . " In Pilgrim Hall , Plymouth , is a specimen of this class , once the property of Elder Brewster , now rounding out a third century in company with Rose Standish 's sampler , the ship chest of Miles Standish , and the table of Governor Carver . Such specimens , however , can not be taken as any way typical of what a quest for old rush furniture would yield . The painted pieces of the early nineteenth century and the older ladder or banister backs form the // larger portion of what one may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really fine chair of mahogany or walnut in Queen Anne style . The latter are the gems of the old rush pieces ? if of walnut , probably made during Anne 's reign , 1702 ? 1714 ; if of mahogany , of a little later date , but quite in the Queen Anne manner . Charming indeed are these old specimens , with fiddle back , cabriole leg and flat-foot ? variously known as " duck " , " web " , and " camel . " This particular furniture extremity went out of fashion as the ball-andclaw grew in favor . Hepplewhite tried to revive it in several exquisite little sewing tables , but late eighteenth-century London would have none of it ? and it really did not belong to the designing of that day . It did , however , fit its own brief period perfectly ; so well , in fact , that there seems little reason to graft it on another . The rush seats of Queen Anne chairs are of superior workmanship and in many cases as well preserved as the frames . New rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A great deal of so-called rush is I 96 The Quest of the Quaint composition , though entirely lifelike on the surface . Paper , twisted and dried and otherwise treated , is the basis of many a new rush seat . There are shops where real " rush seating " is done , but there seems to be a secret brotherhood about the craft difficult to penetrate . Chair frames may be left in the care of many dealers and after a while , a long while , they come back like new . If one is willing to wait and to go to the expense , " real rush " is guaranteed . With fine chairs this is well worth while . When the frames are mahogany , walnut , or chestnut , the best is not too fine , and with the more interesting of the painted pieces , the real is still the wiser choice . With the old " ladder-backs " , which in their best days were for common and hard usage , perhaps the paper ? but that must be left to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where a chair is frankly new , merely old in design , the paper rush does not seem so incongruous . It seems to be merely a part of the modern scheme of things , like the jam in one of Lewis Carroll 's stories ? merely called jam . // The possibilities of rush furniture , whether old or new , are considerable . Suppose the pieces chosen are of the painted variety of the early nineteenth century ? say dining-room chairs , painted black , decorated in grapes in gold and other soft tones , and having seats of finely woven rush , a little green in hue . Chairs of this type are sometimes found with cane seats ; but they are not quite so desirable and so we confine ourselves to rush . These chairs are splendidly adapted to a country dining room , to a dining room in an apartment , and under some conditions , to a city house . One clever craftsman , beginning with six chairs , had a round table made to order , painted it black and decorated it with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chairs . The walls were hung in an old-fashioned block-printed paper copied from one of the rooms in the Wadsworth-Longfellow house , Portland , and obtained from a dealer who makes a specialty of reproducing old designs . The chairs were old , but everything else in the room was new , even to the peasant china on 19 8 The Quest of the Quaint the table , but so well chosen that no inharmony was felt . It was a delightful place , the envy of many visitors and convincing proof that the new may sometimes be combined with the old ; also if you can not have all old be glad of half old , working toward a gradual weeding out process which will mean all old in time . In the Boston News Letter of the third week of November , 1779 , was inserted the following bid for patronage : " Windsors to match any set , mahogany in diverse Patterns with choice of stuffed work , also Rush Bottoms in great variety . Old Chairs needing new Rush Bottoms Mended on exchange . Mousetraps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " li CHAPTER XVI HUNTING HIGHBOYS SOONER or later the old furniture quest leads to a highboy . The way may begin with a broken chair and lead , by gentle stages , to sideboards and four-posters , but there is no escaping the highboy in the end . Frequently it becomes the one thing needed for perfect happiness . I once heard a lover of old furniture say that his house would not be complete until there was a tall clock on the stair landing and a highboy in the upper hall . " You know , " he added , " highboys belong in upper halls . " And if one has an old upper hall or a modern one in the old manner , it is truly an excellent place . Yet it would be a pity to limit the old furniture habit to those fortunate people with roomy second stories . // The highboy was an outgrowth of the chest , as were the dresser , the credence , and the cupboard . Old illuminations show the chest in its various stages of coffer , seat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the settle was evolved . When elevated on a trestle , the chest became the cupboard ; when filled with shelves , it approached the dresser . By a little imagination , nearly every article of furniture may be traced to the chest . During the Middle Ages , it was the poor man 's chief possession , forming a bed at night , a seat by day , and a strong box at all times . When more peaceful conditions prevailed , the chest , as a coffer or locker , lost its significance . In Anglo-Saxon times , the home of the thane contained little furniture . Stools were the seats in common use ; tables were made of boards laid on trestles ; cupboards were extremely primitive , and bedsteads were scarcely more than pallets of straw , protected by skins of beasts . After the Norman conquest , a gradual change took place in English house-furnishing . The comforts which had been known on the Hunting Highboys 20 ! continent for a long period were introduced by William and his followers . The chest of drawers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the sixteenth century . Cupboards , presses , and armoires met the requirements . With the sixteenth century , a different mode of living came into existence . The old feudal life of the Middle Ages was gone . Houses were more comfortable and built with a greater regard for privacy . The bedroom , as a distinct feature of house building , was little known before this time . When this room assumed a distinct character , furniture was especially designed for it , and among the new pieces was the chest of drawers . Of early chests of drawers , Italian specimens are the best examples of handicraft . They contain four drawers , elevated on short feet . The carving is simple , and in the manner of the early Renaissance . Arabesques , garlands , shields , and masks replaced the quatrefoils and cinquefoils of the Gothic period . The ball-foot was a feature of furniture making during the late sixteenth century . It is found on presses , cupboards , // and chests of drawers . When the ball and claw came into general use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of furniture , developed on new lines . The ball-and-claw foot and the cabriole leg were destined to revolutionize furniture making and to prepare the way for the fine cabinetwork of the eighteenth century , in which both England and France had a part . England obtained the cabriole , or bandy leg , from Holland , late in the seventeenth century . The accession of William of Orange in 1688 was followed by an exodus of Dutch and Flemish workmen , who carried with them a more perfect craft than was known across the Channel . Flemish canework had already influenced chairmaking . Dutch marquetry and wood carving now became popular . The bandy leg added lightness and grace to the chest of drawers , elevating it from the ground , and giving opportunity for a different scheme of construction . The early bandy leg of English designing terminated in the flat or club foot , sometimes called the " web foot . " This type // may be studied in chairs of the period , and also in chests of drawers and desks . It was not until about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up to that day the heavier styles of the seventeenth century continued to be in favor . In the colonies the chest of drawers developed on two distinct lines : one resulted in the bureau ; the other in the " highboy . " The first was the direct outgrowth of the chest ; the other was of a more complicated origin . The chest , pure and simple , was one of the earliest of colonial pieces . Ship chests were brought over in numbers by the passengers of the Mayflower . It is safe to say that these were plain , or , if decorated at all , in a very simple manner . Following in the wake of the chest came the chest with a drawer beneath . Convenience soon demanded a second drawer . When a third was added , and the piece of furniture was elevated on short feet , it had grown from a chest with drawers to a chest of drawers , and the colonial bureau was at hand . Early chests of drawers were plain , // like the chests , but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornament became common and occur so frequently as to be easily classified . One was the rounded arch mentioned in connection with the early desk and Bible boxes . Another was a primitive " allover " carving in leaves and flowing lines , called , in a general way , " Hadley " , from the fact that many specimens of this work have been found in and about Hadley , Massachusetts . A third style consisted of " egg " and " drop " ornaments , fastened to a plain surface and stained or painted in another color from the background . Paneled effects were still in use , but their popularity had waned with the introduction of walnut , which was less adapted for panelwork than oak . The high chest of drawers , or highboy , was known in the colonies in the late seventeenth century . It stood on six turned feet connected by a stretcher and was more useful than beautiful . When the cabriole leg reached America it transformed the highboy . The turned feet and heavy stretchers disappeared . When the scroll top or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrought in the highboy . " Highboy " is a comparatively modern word ; " high-chest " is the term which was long used to designate all chests of drawers elevated on four or more feet . " Tallboy " is heard in England but not often here . When walnut followed oak , an intermediate period in furniture making set in , forming a middle ground between heavy pieces of oak and graceful designs in mahogany . One highboy , greatly valued , shows the massive frame , the turned legs , the peculiar arrangement of drawers , characteristic of the early variety . Both Italian and Dutch influences are apparent , but it is an English adaptation of the type . Highboys of this style are not often offered for sale , unless some private collection comes under the hammer . People fortunate enough to inherit such pieces seldom care to part with them , and the chance of running across one in an antique shop is remote . Reproductions of this variety are seldom attempted , and the risk of purchasing a new one by // mistake is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest secure that his six-legged highboy or his four-legged highboy of the type illustrated is really old . When a furniture maker copies an old highboy , he usually selects the cabriole variety . A fine reproduction costs almost as much as an old one . An expert cabinetmaker ( and only an expert should attempt a highboy ) will reproduce all the fine points . Moldings and drawer pulls will be in perfect harmony , and the tone of the wood will be the yellow-brown of the early eighteenth century , not the purplish-red mahogany of a later date . If of the earlier cabriole period , the highboy will be straight on the top , and the molding will have the character of a cornice . The upper portion will be divided into four long drawers and a square center drawer , showing a " full " sunburst . The lower division or frame will usually contain one long drawer and three subdrawers , the center one showing a fan or " half sunburst . " The legs will be slender cabriole type , terminating in the web or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old days was often sold a set of " steps " for china . The steps were placed on top of the chest and on first glance seemed a part of the design . When filled with pitchers , jugs , and bowls , it became an object of housewifely pride . Outwardly was displayed the treasured china of the household ; inside , folded in the long drawers , was the family linen . Time has dealt kindly with many of the old highboys , but the steps and the china are left to the imagination . The high-chest of 1740 presented a different appearance . The divisions of frame and body were much the same , and the drawers held to similar dimensions , but the flat cornice was gone , and the handles and key plates were altered . In place of the straight cornice was the scroll top , destined to be an important feature of furniture making , both in England and America . The scroll or swan top , or broken pediment , as it is sometimes called , continued to be a characteristic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By 1750 the highboy became more diffi208 The west of the Quaint 4. cult of classification . The type was growing complex . On one hand was the secretary , retaining many features of the highchest ; on the other the evolution of the bureau , which was in reality a direct outgrowth of the low chest of drawers , yet combining many of the highboy features . Then there was the true highboy , resembling the earlier type , yet showing a more elaborate scroll and a more curving cabriole . The top or knee of the cabriole , once quite plain , now showed a curved shell , while fancy scrollwork replaced the simple sunburst . Carved finials and ornamental brass work kept pace with other innovations . To many minds the later highboys represent the highest type ; there are others who prefer the highboy of 1730 , just as they prefer the clock of that date . When cabinetmakers used the straight cornice , clockmakers followed in their lead . When the scroll top became a feature of high-chests , clocks soon responded , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woodwork . It is this close relation between designs , this kinship , so to speak , of all // eighteenth-century handicraft , that makes the study of colonial furniture so fascinating . One collector may prefer the plainer style , another waxes eloquent over the elaborately carved pieces , but all must agree that it was a golden age of cabinetmaking , in which beauty of design was only half the story . Open the old drawers and note how careful the interior finish ! How smooth the wood ! How perfect the constructive work ! Note the treatment of the wood ; the durability of the stain ; the care bestowed upon the hidden parts . Yet we wonder why old pieces have lasted so long . Only those who have made long sojourns in New England farmhouses know anything about the base ends to which many old pieces are put . Then there is the other extreme , more disconcerting to the would-be purchaser , when the old chest of drawers , usually of maple or applewood , and possibly pine , plainly of local make and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , valued at a price which would almost buy the farm , and placidly declared to have come over in the Mayflower . Those are occasions 21 0 The Quest of the Quaint when the hunter of old furniture finds silence the better part of valor . Possibly in the next town there is a dealer in antiques who has scoured the country as you can never do , who is master of an art you can never attain ; He has all kinds of old things from foot stoves to churns , and his prices are comparatively moderate . By contrast , the simple farmhouse people seem members of a gigantic furniture trust . He will sell you an old highboy , ? possibly the very one you saw last year in the farmhouse parlor , ? and tell you its entire history . He has powers of persuasion which you unfortunately lack , and which he turns to account . What fine old chairs , quaint pewter , and beautiful china these country dealers sometimes have ! Windsor chairs and painted chairs of the late Sheraton period , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare old piece which museum curators would journey far to secure . CHAPTER XVII BAYBERRY CANDLE AND TALLOW DIP WE have made many improvements in our manner of living since the days of our forefathers , but , as yet , we have found no satisfactory substitutes for firelight and candlelight . Methods of heating and lighting , when viewed from scientific standpoints , have progressed wonderfully ; backlogs and tallow dips are quite outclassed . But , if the other side of the question be considered , we may regret the extreme convenience of steam radiators and electric-light fixtures . Pressing a button or turning a coil will not quicken either log or candle . The colonial revival ? may it never pass ? has brought candlelight again into fashion . The fireplace has become a feature of all modern building , and its root in our hearts and homes is too deeply // fixed to be called a matter of fashion . But candlelight is as yet only an occasional blessing . Candles at the dinner table are an everyday affair . Hidden under shades of silk and fringe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are hardly recognized . Their simplicity is gone , and they might be little electric lights , so far as beauty and poetry are concerned . A candle is at its best in an old candlestick ? brass , pewter , or silver , ? standing on a mahogany table , with snuffers and tray near at hand . If white painted woodwork and such oldtime accessories as samplers and silhouettes are in evidence , so much the better , but they are not essential . The charm of a candlestick is that it fits so well into every background . It is like a well-bred guest , at home in any environment . Candlestick collecting is one of the pleasantest hobbies in existence . It does not require a fortune ; it does not demand a house . It is a useful hobby . Samplers , for instance , can not by any stretch of the imagination be regarded in the light of Bayberry Candle and Tallow Dip 213 household necessities . A collection of teapots can not be classed under the head of the purely useful . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service . Candlesticks can not break ; herein they have the advantage over glass and china . They are not affected by dampness , never fade , nor can moth and rust corrupt . Candlestick collecting does not require travel . The finest old brass stick in the world may be lurking in the junkshop around the corner . There are so many reasons why one should acquire candlesticks . A final reason is , that they never get out of order . They are the same yesterday , to-day , and forever . Of all old sticks , those which we inherit we most dearly prize . There is something extremely human about a brass or silver candle holder which has stood a century of service in one family . Old furniture must be " done over " in order to make it presentable , but the old stick , except for occasional cleaning , remains unchanged . Now that tallow and bayberry candles are made by clever craftsmen , the candlestick can burn in the same old way . // Bayberry candles give forth a sweet , pungent odor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tallow candles , which call to mind a smoking beefsteak . Bayberry dips are a light , greenish brown , tapering slightly at the end . They burn with a beautiful starry gleam , and should never be desecrated by shades . For the Christmas table , and for colonial teas and other patriotic gatherings , nothing could be more appropriate than bayberry tapers . Old silver sticks are seldom found in set outside of private collections , and one must search far for a perfectly matched set in auction room or antique shop . Silver candlesticks were never inexpensive and were seldom found in families of moderate means . They were reserved for the parlor , ? brass , pewter , and iron being in use in other rooms . Silver candlesticks and silver porringers are often mentioned in old wills and inventories . Orders were sent abroad ? usually to London ? for " newest patterns in candleware . " Washington was very fastidious about his china and silver . Thomas JefferBayberry Candle and Tallow Dip 215 son 's love of simplicity did not interfere with his liking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parlor of Monticello a pair of branch candlesticks are still preserved . The dining room contains a beautiful candle-chandelier , still filled with tapers and burned nightly by the present occupant of the house , Jefferson M. Levy , Esq . In connection with this old mansion , a description written in the diary of Marquis de Chastellux , then commanding the French forces in America , is of interest . This distinguished Frenchman is chiefly known in this country by the pleasant things he jotted down in his diary about American houses and American women . " This house , of which Mr. Jefferson was the architect , and often one of the workmen , is extremely elegant , and in the Italian taste , though not without fault . It consists of a large square pavilion , the entrance to which is by two porticoes , ornamented with pillars . The ground floor consists chiefly of a very large , lofty salon , which is decorated entirely in the antique style ; 2 1 6 The Quest of the Quaint above it is a library of the same form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attic story , are joined to the pavilion and communicate with the kitchen offices , etc. , which form a basement under a terrace . " Jefferson seems to have made a special point of illumination . The first Argand burner imported into this country is said to have been used at Monticello . The candlestick collector of modest purse will not sigh for old silver and Sheffield plate , for fire-gilt and jingling prisms ; but turn attention to brass , which offers the finest field . Colonial sticks and Russian sticks in hammered , cast , and spun brass may be found in out-of-the-way corners . They are not very plentiful , but no true collector wants his hobby to become general . Reproductions of old designs are not to be seriously regarded , but one or two good modern candlesticks in copper or bronze will not clash with the old . They will be old in another generation , and will be regarded as characteristic specimens of the metal-work of our day . CHAPTER XVIII A WORD ABOUT SHEFFIELD IT was in 1740 that Thomas Bolsover , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fused in such a manner that the former metal could be completely coated with the purer one , thus presenting to the eye the appearance of silver . The story runs that Bolsover was repairing a knife made of copper and silver when he made this discovery , which was destined to influence the silver trade of all England , and to transform Sheffield from an insignificant town to a great commercial center . Bolsover confined his invention to snuffboxes and buttons . Thomas Hancock , who followed him , and who reaped the benefits of his industry , enlarged the scope of the work , making many articles of use and // beauty which had hitherto been found only in silver . Trays , cake baskets , candlesticks , tea and coffee urns , loving-cups , mugs , beakers , tea sets and coffee sets , lamps , epergnes , coasters , and fruit baskets , were among the graceful pieces which Hancock and his contemporaries made . From Sheffield the industry spread to other towns , Birmingham ranking second . Early Sheffield has several distinct characteristics which render it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As Sheffield trays are famous , a tray is a good thing to cite . If the embossed border of the tray is sterling , if the plain " plate " or shield in the center is of silver , also , if the joints are wrapped or covered with the same metal , the tray is of the early period . The same tests may be made with other pieces , such as cake baskets , teapots , mugs , etc . Old Sheffield is now very scarce , and like most rare things , is extremely valuable . A tray , meeting all the requirements , is quite as valuable as if made of sterling silver . Collectors in this country do not // often encounter old trays . There are trays of copper , plated with silver , and many of them are old in a vague acceptance of the term , but they are not " old Sheffield " , strictly speaking , for that term implies Sheffield made during the " first " period . Later , the sterling borders and shields were discarded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delicacy of the earlier ones . Pieces thus decorated could be sold at a lower figure . The ware was slowly becoming commercialized . Cake baskets , coasters , and candlesticks are the Sheffield articles most frequently encountered . Few of the baskets have silver borders ; the coasters are rarely ornamented with silver ; the candlesticks are usually so worn that the copper foundation is more prominent than the silver . All these pieces are desirable , but they are not early Sheffield , and should not be purchased for such . These articles are invariably fine in design , and when cleaned and replated are valuable additions to the table or sideboard . When articles are to be used , they should be replated . From the collector 's // standpoint , they are more interesting in the worn condition . It may be said here that Sheffield plate of the early period seldom shows the copper . The silver is so thick that a century and a half of wear have made little impression upon it . The article was a thing of beauty when it came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will remain . Few people possess these rare pieces unless their collecting days date back at least a score of years . But the later pieces , provided they are handmade , are worthy of attention . The new trays and candlesticks that masquerade as old should be avoided . The process of making old Sheffield plate was well described a few years ago by Mr. Arnold T. Watson , president of the Sheffield Literary and Philosophical Society , in an address on the " Silver Trade of Sheffield " , delivered before an assembly of silversmiths . Mr. William Watson , in his valuable book , " Pewter and Sheffield Plate " , gives a portion of the address . The method of making the old plate is told in such a // lucid manner that the following paragraphs in Mr. Watson 's own words are given : " A bar or ingot of copper , varying from one inch to one and one half inches in thickness by two and one half inches in breadth , and of any length , according to the size of the article to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surfaces to be plated were well filed , scraped , or planed with a machine constructed on the principle of a joiner 's plane , until perfectly clean , even , and free from blemishes . A sheet of silver varying in thickness from a sixteenth to one-half inch or more , of the same size as the metal plate to which it was to be united , was then likewise filed , etc. , until perfectly clean and even . The two cleaned surfaces were then placed together , the greatest care being taken to avoid fingering them . A plate of copper about one-sixteenth of an inch thick , slightly less in size than the silver , was then placed upon it , and lastly upon the whole was placed a piece of strong iron nearly the length of the ingot , about an inch broad and one-quarter of an inch thick to receive the pressure of the iron // wire . These various plates were then tied firmly and closely together with strong iron wire , twisted , so as to keep them in position during the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver were then touched around with a solution of borax and water , and when dry the bar was ready for the plating furnace . Heat was then applied in a reverberatory furnace until the silver was seen to flow and be in a state of fusion round the edges , which the borax as a flux greatly facilitated . The whole was then quickly removed from the furnace by means of tongs , so constructed as to clasp the sides of the metal without pressing upon the surface , as too much heat or the slightest pressure when in this state would cause the silver to run off and spoil the piece . " The ingot , which was thus plated , was gradually cooled , and placed in strong pickle of spirits of salt or spirits of vitriol and water to free it from borax and the dirt of the furnace , after which it was well scoured with Calais sand and water . It was then rinsed and dried , and the metal sent to the rollers or the forge-hammer to // be drawn out to the desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and during the process frequent annealing was , of course , necessary to prevent its becoming brittle . The sheet , when of required thickness , was cut into the shape suitable for the article to be made , edges or parts being joined together at a moderate heat with solder , borax , and sandiver , formerly a product of the glass-furnace , being used as fluxes . " About the year 1784 , Mr. George Cadman introduced a very valuable improvement in plate manufacture , by soldering silver edges and mounts on plated ware . " If these facts are borne in mind , many of the doubts regarding the age of Sheffield plate will be removed . CHAPTER XIX OVER COLONIAL TEA CUPS TEAPOTS and tea have always had a fascination for the feminine mind . The . sociability promoted by the steaming cup has broken the ice of frozen formality , and even changed the destiny of neighborhoods . Tea and gossip have long been credited with a subtle connection . Over a " dish of tea " the affairs of town and State were discussed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cozy teapot has played an equally important part . Extracts from old letters and diaries show that tea-drinking was firmly established in this country at an early date . In 1740 some one wrote " Almost every little tradesman 's wife must sit sipping tea for an hour or more in the morning , and maybe // again in the afternoon , if they can get it , and nothing will please them to sip it out of but china ware . They talk of bestowing thirty or forty shillings on a tea equipage as they call it . There are the silver spoons , the silver tongs , and many other trinkets that I can not name . " It will thus be seen that the modern tea service , with all its appointments , is not far removed from the old tea equipage with its many trinkets . Teapots were small , and tea was precious stuff , carefully measured by the pinch . " Very fine green tea , the best for color and taste , " was advertised as early as 1715 in a Boston paper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following year . " Arrived on the good ship Ann , Griffin 's wharf , " announces the Boston News Letter , 1733 , " A parcel of fine Chinay , comprising Bowles , Sugar-Boxes , divers shapes in Muggs , Plates , Basons , and Teacupps . " Another paper of similar date sets forth the fact that " On Wednesday next , there will be Sold at the sign of the Golden Cock , a choice Assortment of blue and white // Ware . Complete Setts for the Table . Plates by the Dozen and by the Half , Bowles , Teacupps , likewise Delph Ware , Glass Ware , and Pewter . " In 1735 a Cornhill mantua-maker made known her departure from Boston through the columns of the New England Journal in this manner : " Widow Hepsibah Trott having for Good Reasons moved to Salem leaves with her Lamented Husband 's Mother her Best India China to be Sold at Public Vandoo on The Fifteenth Instant . Said China includes Plates , Sugar-Boxes , Sweetmeat Dishes and One Dozen Teacupps . Also a Silver Teapott and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left behind in Boston were probably of porcelain , called in colonial days , " India . " Most of the china used in England at that date was imported from the Orient by the East India Trading Company , and the name " India " was vaguely given to all Oriental ware . The earliest record of porcelain in the colonies is found in wills and inventories , and from them it may be gathered that the // first china used in America was of Chinese origin . China teacups long antedated china teapots . Oriental potters made only the dishes they were familiar with , and teapots were a European invention . There are many pleasant traditions of teapots over two hundred and fifty years old , of Mayflower teapots , of teapots belonging to John Endicott and Governor Winthrop . Doubtless there were a few , a very few , in America during the early seventeenth century , but they were of pewter or silver , not of " chinay " or " porcelyn . " The first china teapots imported in this country were of English ware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clever English merchant sent a teapot to China , where it was quickly copied . Then came a deluge of Chinese teapots and with it a confusion of English and Chinese designs , destined to lead later to a great china controversy ? a controversy which from time to time still bobs up serenely . Tea had its enemies , even as now . One writer spoke of it as a " base and unworthy // Indian practice " , adding " the truth is , all nations are growing so wicked . " An idea of the tea service of 1773 may be gained from a verse written soon after the Boston Tea Party . " Farewell the tea-board with its gaudy equi-page Of cups and saucers , cream-bucket , sugar-tongs , The pretty tea-chests , also , lately stored With Hyson , Congo , and best Double Fine . Full many a joyous moment have I sat by ye , Hearing the girls tattle , the old maids talk scandal . Though now detestable , Because I am taught , and I believe it true , Its use will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America . " While tea-drinking has been termed a feminine pastime , it has had its masculine devotees as well . Doctor Johnson consumed tea in great quantities . His huge teapot , made to order , held three quarts . Horace Walpole 's devotion to tea is well known . Like his love for old china , it was // " a passion of his soul . " Other and less famous men have praised the cup that cheers . In America tea-drinking has never attained the popularity it enjoys in England and Russia . Our English cousins say that we do not know how to make it , but the real reason lies in the fact that we do not know how to drink it . We are not willing to give the time necessary for the comfortable drinking of afternoon tea . English women owe their lack of nerves quite as much to the afternoon cup as to the English climate . Here we consider tea and nerves synonymous . Among the teapots that have come down to us from the good old days are those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Worcester , of " Lowestoft " , each unlike the other , and each embodying the story of a famous pottery . The cups that once belonged to these old teapots are seldom found to-day . Most of them long since went the way of much rare china . Those that have survived are small , without handles , and rest on a high base . In // shape they are decidedly Oriental and show the marked influence that Chinese potters exerted over all English clay-workers . Cups with handles came at a later day but were not in universal use until after the Revolution . Wedgwood tea sets found their way to America as early as 1765 . This " Queen 's Ware " was a deep ivory tint of slightly uneven glaze , and the shapes , especially the teapots , were extremely graceful . Later , when the prices of Bohea and Hyson were lowered , and second cups could be indulged in , teapots assumed larger dimensions . Some of these old articles are huge affairs and suggest that second cups were hardly the limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shapes are things of beauty . The handles are well placed , and the spouts rise at the proper angle . Old teapots should be a lesson to modern potters who have erred sadly in this particular . Whether it was the brightness of the berry or the aristocratic significance of the leaf , British potters of the eighteenth century had a great liking for the strawberry // vine . They used it on early common stoneware and later with conspicuous success on fine china . At Bristol it particularly flourished , and it is the Bristol variety that is known best in this country . We find the strawberry on tea sets and occasionally on plates and platters , vivid as to color and often uncertain as to drawing , but always quaint and interesting . A red edge is a characteristic feature of Bristol ware , being seen on many of the pieces found in America . This Bristol , it hardly need be said , is crockery , not china , although a superior grade . A similar pattern was also used on Bristol china , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The entire history of the Bristol works is extremely interesting and forms a different tale from that of other English potteries . Hard paste was made there , the only hard paste made in England , with the exception of the small output at Plymouth . Great credit is due the Bristol workers , for they were able under decidedly adverse conditions to work out problems which English potters as a whole were unable to do . // Wedgwood undoubtedly gave the strawberry motif its greatest distinction , one of his well-known " Queen 's Ware " patterns being charmingly decorated with it . The ground is the agreeable cream color found in old Queen 's pieces , and the vine , which is in the nature of a narrow border , is conventionalized in a most attractive manner . The color of the leaves is a soft olive-green , and the berries are less brilliant than those found on Bristol . The vine follows the edge of the pieces and is the only decoration , the body of the china being entirely unadorned . But the beautiful ivory tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strawberry proved a great favorite in England and was popular over here . A few years ago this pattern was revived at the Wedgwood works and may now be purchased at the largest china shops . It is a very satisfactory thing for actual use , and as it may be secured in dinner sets , it makes a decided appeal to the housekeeper , who wishes something out of the ordinary , yet likes conservative things on her table . In general style it is in the // same interesting class as old white and gold banded china , and in some ways is more desirable . It may be used with other china if care is taken in the combining , while white and gold looks best by itself ; consequently many pieces are necessary in order to set a table . Much of the modern white and gold is unpleasantly cold , the white being of a slight bluish cast . This is not the best grade . The English ware of the best type , whether old or new , has a creamy background , not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most French white-and  - -  gold which is the usual ware of the shops . Fine English white and gold sells sometimes as high as four dollars a dinner plate . Real gold is used in the borders , and the pieces last for generations . The strawberry Queen 's Ware is not so expensive but is more costly than the average white and gold imported from France . The strawberry pattern is occasionally found on old Crown Derby and on Davenport , the latter usually showing a deep blue border ? a colorful combination , but // well executed and extremely effective . If one were to collect the strawberry pattern alone , quite a variety of pieces could be gathered together . One or two such pieces would add undoubted interest to any miscellaneous collection , and to that end , an old Bristol teapot and a Wedgwood plate or platter are recommended . It is possible to buy complete tea services in strawberry Bristol , even to the teacups , but such sets are expensive and must be hunted . A unique Bristol teapot , the only surviving piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a narrow line of sage green outlining the cover and spout . This band or border is very characteristic of early Bristol . A teapot with an orange flower ? a flower , by the way , that grows only on old china ? has a curious cover . The knob is in the form of a swan , white , tipped with dull blue , ? another idea borrowed from the Chinese . Bow teacups are seldom found to-day , and Chelsea are exceedingly rare . The ware so often called Chelsea ? clear , white china with raised flowers and leaves of // lavender , was made after the original Chelsea factory had passed out of existence , and is not over eighty years old . Wedding tea sets were often of this dainty porcelain and are treasured still in many households . The pieces are tall and slender , quite the reverse of earlier shapes , and while graceful and well-molded , are lacking in quaintness . They form an important link , however , in the china chain and should find a place iii every collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and silver luster tea sets form a group by themselves . Silver luster tea sets are among the most charming in existence when outline is under consideration . The low , fluted teapots , the creamers , and sugar bowls , each one perfect in design , are beautiful specimens of the potters ' art . The shapes are similar to those seen in old silver , and it is quite probable that the discarded molds of some silversmith were utilized by the first makers of silver luster . Pink luster is found in a variety of shapes and is one of the prettiest wares to use on the table . Many of the old printed tea236 The Quest of the Quaint pots , sugar bowls , and creamers , and even the cups and saucers , while effective as bits of decoration , are not satisfactory on a modern table . This is especially true of blue Staffordshire . Some of the Staffordshire teapots show a wealth of imagination , if a limited knowledge of geography and anatomy . The potter doubtless knew his own small corner of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Knowing little of the Continent , less of America , and nothing of the Orient , he drew a series of foreign views that to-day furnish food for thought and an infallible cure for the blues . Chinese pagodas , Greek temples , Swiss villas , and American cataracts were sometimes blended in the same landscape , while Indians beneath tropical palms were placed side by side with turbaned Turks or English ladies in large bonnets . After the blue wave in Staffordshire , came the mulberry , the pink , the green , and the brown . Then came the decline . Colors paled , and designs lost their charm . The reign of the commonplace in china had begun . CHAPTER XX THE ROMANCE OF GLASS IF you overhear some one talking of " ruby " , " emerald " , " sapphire " , or " amethyst " do not imagine for a moment that precious stones are under discussion . It is merely some enthusiastic glass collector gloating over his latest find . He may have secured a bit of red Bohemian , green Bristol , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Millefiore . Collecting Millefiore glass is the latest of fads , reflecting to-morrow , rather than to-day . As yet , few people are hunting , and it is a still hunt with . the source of supply carefully concealed . One collector , Mr. Ross Hall Maynard of Boston , owns more than a hundred Millefiore paperweights . The black cabinet containing this brilliant assemblage L 2 3 8 The Quest of the tiaint suggests the cave of jewels of the " Arabian Nights . " " Glass of a thousand flowers " our grandmothers called it ? a fanciful name for a fanciful thing . Yet Millefiore is an interesting phase of American glassware meriting attention from several viewpoints . Mechanically it is clever , suggesting the old puzzle of the metal tongue in the round sleighbell . Paperweights formed the chief output , although seals and door knobs were also made . Bohemian influence is strong in many of the articles and it is probable that foreign workmen were extensively employed . Several factories produced this gayly colored glass , and in the absence of marks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Millefleur , Millefiore . The old name was better ? certainly more American . The interest in old glassware is steadily increasing , particularly in specimens showing purple and amber tones ; in early American specimens and in genuine Stiegel . Enameled Stiegel is valuable , but // the present demand is for the flint glassware made by that picturesque character , Baron William Henry Stiegel of Manheim , Pennsylvania , between the years 1769 and 1774 . As one of our early craftsmen , he takes high rank , while his romantic career affords a splendid theme for a melodrama . Some of the recent prices paid for Stiegel blue , green , and white flint have been almost sensational . Aside from the beautiful color value of this Manheim product , the " singing " quality of the glass is noteworthy . Experts can tell real Stiegel by its clear , ringing note , although the peculiar tones of blue and green are unmistakable . Unlike the sapphire blue of Bohemian or the purple-blue of English glass , Stiegel blue has a softer , grayer hue when held to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illuminating , occasionally astonishing . At the recent sale of the Pleasant Hunter Collection at the American Art Galleries in New York , many records in current prices were broken . A collection so varied and so complete drew a large and // representative audience from many parts of the country . On three consecutive afternoons , nearly the same group of people assembled , and the attention was as breathless as if the newest war play were being presented . Fads and hobbies change from year to year ; and in no better way may they be gauged than on such an occasion . Not only were the specimens extremely rare in their respective classes , but they had been gathered in such numbers as to make the collection notable in a city famous for the opportunities it offers to buyers of beautiful old objects of art . There were cases of canary luster , of the rarest types of silver resist , of rose and purple lusters , of Whieldon , of Turner , of salt glaze , of Worcester , of Leeds , of early American blown glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the highly decorative milk-white glass painted in brilliant colors . Many of the choicest examples of rose and purple luster will enrich a well-known Chicago collection , but the finest of the old // glass will remain in New York . The copper lusters went for comparatively low prices and furnished one of the surprises of the sale . Another but more cheerful surprise was supplied by the historical blue Staffordshire . Truly it is never safe to predict what dark blue Staffordshire will or will not bring . Who could have foreseen that a ten-inch " McDonough 's Victory " plate would reach the high figure of fifty-seven dollars , or that a nine-inch " City Hotel New York " plate would go at eighty dollars ? The New York plate is , of course , a very good one , but " McDonough 's Victory " may be secured any day with a little patience and a twenty dollar bill ? for less than twenty if one have Staffordshire luck . Several cup plates sold well , notably a dark blue " Cadmus " for seventeen dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the latter making an excellent record per square inch . The gem of the Staffordshire was a fruit dish with tray showing Dr. Syntax in three different views , namely " The Wit of the Widow " , " Drawing from Nature " , and // " Bound to a Tree . " Collectors of Syntax designs will recognize the rare combination here . The printing was remarkably clear and the color equal in beauty to old Nankin . A raised floral border and a deep openwork band added value and interest . The price paid for this old dish , one hundred and thirty-five dollars , was the highest of the first day of the sale . It is interesting to note that when the first portion of Doctor Hunter 's collection was sold two years ago , the real bargains of the sale were in Staffordshire . Whether historical pieces are again on the rise remains to be seen . If they are , it will be a happy time for the dealers . The old glass showed the same taste and discrimination on the part of Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be the standard by which future ones will be measured for a long while to come . There were fine specimens of German and Bohemian glass and a beautiful array of old flip mugs . Chief interest centered in the milk-white glass and in the purple or amethyst glass of English origin . The present demand for all the purple shades // accounted for the lively bidding . David Belasco , whose liking for samplers , old printed fabrics , and glassware is well known , was a keen bidder for the fine amethyst specimens . A pair of mantel vases , urnshape with covers , went to Mr. Belasco for seventy dollars . To him also went a pair of pressed celery glasses of the same beautiful color for the big figure of sixtytwo dollars and fifty cents apiece . They were not so attractive in design as the vases , or so fine in workmanship , but they were splendid examples of deep purple . Other good things secured by this collector were a pair of English glass pitchers flashed with red , twenty-six dollars each , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a cream jug of purple glass , twentytwo dollars , and a number of opaque or milk-white pieces . Historic bottles were numerous and reasonable . Some of the real bargains were pepper boxes . Salt-shakers also went for a song . Where are the good old days when a fine copper luster fluted pepper box would easily bring eighteen or more round dollars ? // Most of these small articles went to one buyer who may be considered very fortunate . Possibly it merely meant that only one pepper-box enthusiast was present ? and one hobbyist always has a clear field . As a whole , the painted white glass went at fair prices . Some charming bits brought only six , seven , and nine dollars . The decorative quality of this glassware is difficult to convey by either text or photographs . The colors are brilliant , producing in some cases a most vivid effect . There were teapots , mugs , jugs , tankards , hotwater pitchers , and several covered dishes . Birds , flowers , heraldic designs , medallions , and biblical figures made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says the enthusiastic collector of Staffordshire , " looks so insignificant when combined with old blue . " Quite true . But why group glass and china together ? The combination is as incongruous as lace and pewter , brass and ivory , copper and egg-shell porcelain . Glass needs a cabinet to itself , where it will develop a wealth of possibilities . // Even if attention be confined to so-called white glass , there is a wide range in tint . And if old European specimens are under consideration , there is a great variety of tone . Old red Bohemian rivals the most brilliant of ruby lusters . Old Venetian glass vies with all the luminous glazed ware of Italy and Spain . A collection of . old American bottles will contain a color gamut so varied that all the colors of the spectrum are represented in countless gradations . Old table glass of American make at first glance seems devoid of color , yet if compared with modern pieces it will show a slightly greenish tinge . It is seldom true white . The old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyday channels is usually pressed , occasionally blown , rarely cut . It often takes the form of salt cellars , sauce dishes , cup plates , etc. , with an occasional decanter or goblet . Toddy glasses are among the most interesting things which congregate with old plates and teapots . They suggest the good old days of colonial cheer better than anything else except punch bowls . They have a fascinating // way of never being quite perfect , of having a bubble here and a depression there ; a happy accident giving each an individuality . People who devote much time to glass declare that it is far more individual and human than china , and that each piece is a story in itself . There are so many kinds , and each kind has so many divisions , that a small collection if well chosen will yield a delightful variety . Seldom is a collection begun deliberately . Like many other things , it begins by accident . A sauce dish with a border of strawberry leaves perhaps is the first acquisition , or a cup plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eagle , or a flask of twisted green , or possibly a decanter of old Bohemian red with the grape-vine , or a bit of Bohemian amber or , but this would be a more remote possibility , a sugar basket of deepest blue , set in a silver or a Sheffield stand . Any one of these furnishes an excellent excuse to begin . The difficulty is to find an excuse to stop , once interest is aroused . It may not be possible for many to collect // the choicest old pieces , but if one will concentrate on glass , a collection will soon fill a cabinet . Bottles alone afford a delightful hobby , and bottles are recommended as the most interesting of comparatively inexpensive things . Mrs. Emma Carlton , of New Albany , Indiana , has written in a delightful vein concerning bottles , her own fine collection doubtless providing the inspiration . Like all things collectable the bottle opens up undreamed-of possibilities and is confined to no locality . New bottles , especially those of foreign make , are of marked interest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old one . Of old foreign specimens may be mentioned the tear bottles of Venice , usually of opaque glass of a lovely turquoise blue . They were designed to hold the tears of the penitent and when filled were offered to an image of the Virgin Mary . Tear bottles may be purchased in Venice to-day ? blue and gold , white and gold , and of a beautiful luminous brown , not unlike the " gold stone " in your greatgrandmother 's brooch . All old wine bottles // are interesting , none being more so than Norwegian ones of white glass , painted in peasant style in brightest blues , reds , yellows , and greens . American specimens by contrast seem quite plain , but if well arranged make a fine color study . Mrs. Carlton has part of her collection arranged on shelves fitted into a window , where every bottle glows and gleams with reflected light , each taking an additional beauty from its neighbor . Pale seagreens , deep ambers , faint yellows , rich browns , ruby reds , sapphire blues , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form ranges from high , slender , tube-like bottles to low , broad bottles , with all possible variations , between . " In the whole field of what are undeservedly regarded as fads , " says Mrs. Carlton , " there is probably no interest more unusual , and in the eye of superficial inspection more unwarranted , than the quest known as bottle collecting . ' Strange to say , too , there are partial participants in this fascinating pursuit who do understand or sympathize with the enthusiasm of those // more absorbed devotees who eagerly strive to master all the degrees . " All true lovers of form and color , however , must meet on common ground , and admit that , viewed from the most serious and studious standpoint , the bottle ? merely as a creative achievement ? is entitled to high artistic rank . Surely no emanation from the brain of man is nearer pure poetry in structure than these same breath-born glass bubbles named bottles . That the bottle , as an object for special appreciation and admiration , has been so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitherto stood almost entirely for utility , and has been largely devoted to man 's prosaic needs in health and out of health . But the bottle is coming to its own , and bottle collectors are confident in their belief and earnest in their testimony . " Of first interest to those whose collections are devoted to American antiquities stand the historical flasks and bottles ; curious old designs in glassware , which in the first half of the nineteenth century were issued in illustration of important national events , // as well as in tribute to personages of national distinction at that period . Setting aside what may be termed the intentionally artistic bottle , the high-class Venetian , Bohemian , and French specimens , the inadvertently artistic bottle seems to have a choicer joy to the eye . This tall clear glass cone of American manufacture repeats the outlines of an ancient Venetian water-bottle , minus the exquisite decoration of pond-lilies and lily-pads . Crackleware bottles in clear class and golden amber , and stately old bits of lovely Bohemian glassware are now and then , in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottles of purely commercial attention , half a century old , have interest and charm . Of these are the old golden , red , or brown-amber log-cabin bottles ? pioneer tributes , and numberless barrel bottles ; these latter ? bad in artistic suggestion ? are yet comfortable in outline , and abound in thrifty , homely , early American suggestion . Older than these , are the long amber ear-of-corn bottles and the opalescent Bunker Hill Monument flasks . // " To the true bottle-lover , everything relative to glassware is of interest , and the American student of interesting and beautiful bottle shapes , antique or modern , foreign or native , will find pleasure in the fact that molding bottles , or pressing glass in metallic molds , is believed to be entirely of American origin . Crude forms in molded glass were made in this country during the first quarter of the nineteenth century ; but in 1826 Mr. Enoch Robinson , in the employ of the New England Glass Company , Boston , took out letters-patent for the invention of a process by which furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of pressed glass . " The validity and originality of this patent were fully tested by a closely contested lawsuit in Philadelphia , carried on against powerful firms of glass makers in Pittsburgh . The first glass salt-stands were molded by Mr. Robinson in 1827 , as well as various other articles for table use , and from that time the invention was considered established as of general applicability . Boston pressed glass to the value of one
