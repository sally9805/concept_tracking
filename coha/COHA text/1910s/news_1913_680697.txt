The startled depositors no sooner discovered the notice on the doors of the bank at Orange Street and Roseville Avenue than they learned that a search was being made for Raymond E. Smith , the Secretary and Treasurer , who had vanished immediately after the sudden and unexpected appearance of the State Bank Examiners . Mr. Smith disappeared early on Wednesday morning after having left word with the examiners that he was going to breakfast , and although yesterday there were rumors of his having been heard from over the telephone , none of these rumors could be confirmed . Smith , on whom the management of the affairs of the trust company practically devolved , had been disapproved by the Banking Department as long ago as 1910 , but the Directors had continued him in his place of responsibility .
