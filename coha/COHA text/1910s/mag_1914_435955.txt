IN all the discussions which I have heard on the nature of women , there are two main difficulties . First , it is very hard for us to talk at all without considerable heat . We may begin coolly enough , but in the end we are pretty sure to work up to a vehemence quite different from that with which we handle a purely academic question . The fact is , the question is not a purely academic one , it is an intensely practical and personal one , for it concerns itself in a very radical and searching way with one of the things we most deeply prize ? family life in the home . This is what is really involved in every answer to the question . Here is Mr. W. L. George 1 telling us , that because woman is one kind of person , therefore the home has been and is her worst enemy . Here is Mr. J. L. Tayler = assuring us that because she is another kind of person , therefore the home is and must be her salvation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an odd situation . We are surrounded by women . Half of us are women ourselves , and yet we are in serious doubt as to what women essentially are . Perhaps , though , serious doubt ' is the wrong phrase . ' Distracting controversy ' would be better . For few people seem really in doubt . Al- Woman and To-morrow . By W. L. GEORGE . New York : D. Appleton . 1913 . See also his Atlantic article , December , 1913. 2 The Nature of Woman . By J. LIONEL TAY LER . New York : E. P. Dutton &; Co. 1913. 510 most every one has very firm opinions , and yet no one appears to have the kind of knowledge which is readily transmissible to others . Argument does not change people 's opinions , therefore : it only heats them up just where they stand . And even if we escape this heating process , and are able to regard the matter with some placidness of spirit , there is still a second difficulty to meet , in a lack of the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we all have data enough , of a certain sort . Indeed , this is one trouble . On matters somewhat remote , knowledge of which has to be achieved with some effort , Ise are apt to be fairly teachable , ready to accept expert opinion ? almost too ready . But where some of the facts are matter of daily observation , we are rather apt to make hasty judgments and then stick to them firmly ? for have we not seen with our eyes ? and are not our eyes as good as another 's ? We draw sweeping conclusions from the instances which have happened to arrest our attention , and when others confront us we ignore them or dispose of them as exceptions . There is in particular a natural tendency to assume that the qualities we see in any species are qualities fixed in that species . For example , I may have become familiar with geraniums as I have seen them in window-gardens , where they have shown a lankiness of stem and prominence of pot that impresses me unpleasantly . I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rheumatic- THE UNKNOWN QUANTITY IN THE WOMAN PROBLEM 511 looking stems , and yellowish leaves that fall off , and no blossoms to speak of . ' But if I chance to see geraniums growing in California , I shall have to construct my idea of them de novo . Now our ideas about women are very much in the condition of my postulated idea about geraniums . There are a good many different window-gardens where women are growing , and , according to those we happen to have observed , our conception of woman will vary . And though California , as it chances , is offering to women , as well as to geraniums , a new environment , it is too soon to look for any results by which to correct our impressions . If , then , we turn from our own observations and appeal to scientific principles we are no better off . It is upon biological principles that the Feminists , according to Mr. George , base their assertion that ' there are no men and here are no women , ' and therefore ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also on biological principles that Mr. ' Po Icr bases his contrary conclusions that , the influence of sex is stamped deeply into the intellectual and spiritual nature of men and women . Evidently , biology has not reached a stage ? % here it can help us . On one point every one seems agreed : that at the present moment women are actually different from men . Therefore it would appear that the burden of proof rests upon those who maintain that they are potentially like them . But , the appeal to observation and that to biology having both failed , what is there left ? There is the appeal to experiment . The nature of the experiment would be determined by the nature of the argument . Now the argument of those radicals who stand for the alikeness of men and women is that women are at present different from men because of their different training . One might illustrate by another case from among the plants . Here are dandelions growing in deep grass . Their stems are as long as the grass-blades , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one were to say , ' Dandelions have stems a foot and a half long . They need deep grass to grow in , otherwise their stems would flop over and lie on the ground . ' It would sound reasonable enough if we had not happened to notice what dandelions do on a close-shaved lawn ? how their almost stemless blossoms star the green carpet and escape the closest-set blades of the mower . If one had seen the second condition instead of the first , one might have argued that dandelions could not grow at all in long grass because they would get no sunshine . There we have , in a figure , the gist of the radical argument . Society , it maintains , does not know what women are really like because it has never tried to find out . It has never tried to find out because it supposed that it knew . It has gone round and round in a circle , giving women the training that was sure to bring out certain so-called womanly attributes , and then claiming to discover in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , the cause or the result ? Experiment would answer . It might follow two lines : a group of boy-babies might he set apart and brought up precisely like girls , and a group of girl-babies might be brought up precisely like boys . The first line is not likely to be tried . The use of criminals for experiment is defensible , but we do not recognize any class of infant criminals . The second line of experiment has not thus far been tried except in the field of school studies . Here , indeed , there are already some results worthy of attention . Professor Thorndike of Columbia , in his little book called 512 THE UNKNOWN QUANTITY IN THE WOMAN PROBLEM Individuality , ' gives the results which he has reached during his study of pedagogic problems . He finds that there is practically no difference ascertainable between the intellectual power of boys and that of girls so far as this is subject to school-tests . He concludes that individuality is the whole thing ? that variations among individuals as such are enormous , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important than has been popularly supposed.2 It ought to be noted that , women being still under such different conditions from men , all experiments which show likeness between them and men ought to be given great weight , since this likeness must be existent in spite of considerable discouragement . On the other hand , all experiments which show unlikeness ought to be given somewhat less weight , because this is only what was to be expected . For this reason Professor Miinsterberg 's jury experiments with men and women are not to our purpose . He shows that eighteen women react differently from eighteen men . But even if this proved that all women react differently from all men , it would prove only what is generally accepted . Considering the way in which women 's reasoning powers have been discounted , and their powers of so-called ' intuitive ' perception have been encouraged and even glorified , it would be strange if they showed much capacity for correcting their judgments through the avenue of discussion . That women really are still under different conditions from men may perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By EDWARD L. THORND1KE . Boston : Houghton Mifflin Co. 1911 .

Ton AUTHOR . will be argued , have had excellent opportunities for development ? more opportunities than many a newsboy who has risen to eminence . True , but equality of condition is not determined by material advantages alone . Good physical and mental training , good economic environment , these are not enough unless they are backed by what I may call , for lack of a better phrase , a general attitude of expectancy . The newsboy will serve as illustration . Many a one has indeed risen to eminence . He has done this with the minimum of material opportunity and the maximum of material hindrance . He has had neither good physical training nor good mental training , but he has had one bit of knowledge ? the knowledge that , if he ' has it in him , ' he has a chance to become eminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may mean being President , or being an inventor , or being a banker . Whatever his goal , he knows that being a newsboy , though it constitutes a handicap , does not throw him out of the race . He knows that the world of men whose standards matter to him , think of his chances in this way . They may not be actually thinking about him at all . But he knows that if , or when , they do think of him , this will be their attitude . This I call the attitude of expectancy . A sheaf of sermons might be written on its workings . It is this which until very lately has been lacking to girls . With a girl , there has been no question whether or not she ' has it in her . ' It has been taken for granted that she has n't it in her . Her being a girl is different from being a newsboy , because instead of constituting merely a heavy handicap , it has actually thrown her out of the race . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of society makes more difference than all the material things which it may bestow or THE UNKNOWN QUANTITY IN THE WOMAN PROBLEM 513 withhold . I believe , too , that it will be he last thing to change . Not one of us , no matter what our opinions , is untouched by it . There are many people who are ready explicitly to admit the equality of women and men , but whose instinctive reactions are widely at variance with their deliberate theories . It is amusing or annoying as you happen to look at it . We are all in the grip of tradition ? of what Professor William G. Sumner used to call the mores ' ; and they are stronger than we are because the momentum of the whole race is in them . This attitude toward women , largely unconscious , implied rather than expressed , begins at birth and stacks the cards for the whole game . Over the cradle ? or whatever now takes the place of the cradle ? discussion begins as to whether the sex is not already plainly apparent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a girl , just 10 look at her , ' or , ' He 's boy all over , already . ' Even the nursery rhymes carry out the ancient traditions : ? Here indeed is the gospel of the eternal feminine in all its baldness : ' parasitism and the ' sheltered life , ' the delicacy of the dependent nature , its beauand its vanity and its patience . It may be objected that these doggerels come out of a past which we have outgrown . But this is only partly true . We are indeed outgrowing that past , but we have not sloughed it off . We r ? L. II3 - NO. 4 bear it about with us still , and , though we may smile at these quaint survivals of an earlier day we can not disregard them . They are chips on the current showing how it sets , and though there are counter currents ? even a great tide of new influences ? yet these forces out of the past must be reckoned with . it As we go on from infancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The little girl is surrounded with dolls and pretty trifles , the little boy with tools and games of strength and skill . When we see the girl crooning over her doll we call attention to the ' natural mother , ' while perhaps the natural father ' latent in the little boy beside her has never been called out . The persistent love of dolls on the part of very little boys is the occasion of much amusement among adults , or still oftener among older children in the ruthless stage of middle childhood . No wonder it is soon suppressed . The era of furry toy animals has been a great blessing to all little boys , because it has given them an outlet for the brooding maternalism ? or let us call it paternalism ? with which they are overflowing . The boy may not without self-consciousness take a doll to bed , but he may go to sleep with his arms about his teddy bear . ' In the matter of children 's dress we are indeed working toward better things . The little girl is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is left ungarnished , but these differences are as nothing compared with those of the past . The present fashion of short hair and rompers ' for girls and boys alike is in the nature of a revolution when we contrast it with the period of which Miss Austen 's novels have given us so intimate a knowledge , or the later period in which 514 THE UNKNOWN QUANTITY IN THE WOMAN PROBLEM one of its victims ? a bold and joyous spirit ? said that little girls had no legs ? they had only feet pinned to the bottoms of their pantalettes . ' Even in the realm of literature there is still something to be desired . We may smile at the assumption of our grandfathers that female literature ' was in a class by itself , at the attitude which encouraged the production and tolerated the existence of such books as The Lady 's Keepsake . Yet the same tradition is carried on to-day in the magazines specifically for boys , for girls , for women , and for ' ladies . ' There is justification , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for men and women has not yet been tried . If , meanwhile , without such equal conditions , occasional women have been able to qualify , side by side with men , it may indicate that women as a body have certain things in them ' which society has not believed them to have . But it may only indicate this for the occasional woman , which every one has always known . Until it is possible to point to more than an occasional woman , it might be well to regard the feminine nature as an unknown quantity , to be investigated with an open mind . It might be better still to let it alone ; but we know very well that we shall not let it alone . We shall go right on , data or no data , debating whether women are really only ' female men , ' as wonderful old Dr. Bushnell denied , or whether they are that mystic blending of subjection and inspiration which he believed them to be and which so fired his enthusiasm . It has fired the enthusiasm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor brutal men , nor domineering men . And this suggests one consideration which it may be well to touch upon . It is an obvious fact , although one which people seem able to forget , that men and women , for at least part of their lives , want to attract and please each other more than they want almost anything else . One of the ways of doing this is through the challenge and the relief of contrast . Therefore men and women have at least thought that they liked the other sex for the things in which it differed from their own . Each has at times been glad of its own defects since these have brought out the qualities of the other . A man has smiled over the clumsiness of his hands because it has reduced him to joyful dependence upon the deftness of a woman 's fingers . A woman has been well content with her weakness because of a certain exquisite pleasure she has both given and received in resting on a man 's strength . This is not entirely a sex-instinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it seems most marked between the sexes , and it can not be lightly brushed aside as sentimentality or affectation . It might conceivably interfere with the great experiment . For just as women and men began to discover that they were more alike than they had supposed , they might deliberately set about being different , just because it struck them as more interesting . - In men , this impulse , this admiration of what is different , has been balanced by another . For if a man , at certain periods and in certain moods , strongly desires to meet the standards set for him by women , he also desires , almost all the time , and in almost every mood , to meet the standards set for him by men . Often the two desires work together . Sometimes they run counter . One at its height is called love , the other honor . In women , on the other hand , the corresponding impulse ? to come up to the standards of other women ? has been very faint , except in regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women are meeting one THE UNKNOWN QUANTITY IN THE WOMAN PROBLEM 515 another in clubs , in institutions , in many kinds of associated work , they arc doing things together in larger or smaller groups , and this is beginning to have its effect . Whereas among men there have always been recognized two sorts , the man 's man and the woman 's man , ? among women also there are coming to be two sorts , the man 's woman and the woman 's woman . This fact , too , will have its influence in determining the future development of women 's nature and ideals . There is so far , then , nothing very conclusive to be said as to the nature of women . We have opinions , but no proof ? if we define as proof , evidence which carries conviction to all intelligent minds . For clearly it will not do to class as unintelligent all those whom our particular bundle of evidence fails to convince . I said it might be better to let the whole matter drop . But , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so , because , as we have seen , it is not an academic question . For there is this matter of the home pressing for adjustment . If woman is precisely like man , then perhaps home has been her worst enemy ? or at least , is so now . And if this is true , we ought to know it , and do something about it . King Alfred , watching the cakes baking before the fire , his mind on the welfare of a kingdom , is considered a touching picture of royalty debased . Is woman in the same situation ? King Alfred let the cakes burn , and no one ? except the narrow-minded houseife ? seems to have blamed him . There are people to-day who think that if women let their cakes burn they are not to blame either . The men may eat burned cakes ? it serves them right for making the women do all the tendint of them . But it might be contended that King Alfred really was to blame , royal though he was . He promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ? a clear case of breach of trust . So with us women . Here we are , with the cakes on our hands . Perhaps it is true that we have been debarred from our rights , from our kingdom . Perhaps we must anxiously plan , see visions and dream dreams , before we come into it . But meanwhile , have we any right to let the cakes burn ? III The situation is this : owing to conditions so far in the past that we can only dimly guess at them , the institution of the home arose . It undoubtedly had certain real uses which at least in part justified its existence , one of the most obvious of these being the provision of a relatively peaceful environment for the rearing of children . Men can get along without homes . So can women . But children can not . In the course of time , owing again to complex conditions , the home came to be woman 's peculiar charge . It still is . It has been handed down to her from age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held responsible for it . She may maintain it static , or she may improve it , but she must not let it go to pieces until she has provided something better . She is answerable for this , not to the men of the past , who were doubtless never consciously responsible for the condition of subjection in which women lived ; not even to the men of the present , who , although perhaps somewhat more conscious , still feel themselves largely at the mercy of existing institutions ; but to the children . She is bound to furnish them homes until she can give them something demonstrably better . This is what she is trying to do . Not the feminists alone , or the suffragists alone ; not even the anti-suffragists , who , in the name of the home , seem permissior 516 THE UNKNOWN QUANTITY IN THE WOMAN PROBLEM often to be darkening counsel rather than illuminating . Intelligent women of all creeds see that home-management needs reform . But it does not appeal to me as a good start to begin by belittling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does . ' I contend , ' he says , that her work is mainly sterile , that it is essentially humiliating . . . . I contend too that labor in the home steals from woman her individuality , her originality , her opportunities for self-expression and self-development ; that it makes her stupid , limited , harsh ( or sentimental ) , that it deprives her of her beauty and her grace , divorces her from her true social function and generally unfits her to become the equal companion whom man could respect . ... Woman is preoccupied with infinite small cares , and it does not much matter what they are ; most of them are sterile . . . . A full half of woman 's time is absorbed by these domestic complexities . . . . Every care disturbs and deflects her from other pursuits and from thought . . . . The great mass of these cares is pure futility . ' This is a severe arraignment , but it loses some of its force when we realize that it is an arraignment , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anu more particularly of any administrative business . My occupation , ' says President Eliot , ' offers , I believe , more variety than that of most professional men : yet I should say that nine tenths of my work , from day to day , was routine work , presenting no more novelty or fresh interest to me than the work of a carpenter or blacksmith , who is always making new things on old types , presents to him . ' If the President of Harvard could say this of his work , it may probably 1 The Durable Satisfactions of Life . By CHARLES W. ELIOT . New York : T. Y. Crowell &; Co. 1910. be said with even greater emphasis of most other work . Everything depends on the spirit in which it is said . Often , to complain of the sterility of work is to arraign not the work but the worker . Every one knows that it is possible to go through the same routine in such a way as to make it either sterile or fruitful , and the habit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one to be regretted . It is perhaps inevitable . We tend to belittle whatever we have recently outgrown , and though women have , I hope , not altogether outgrown the home , they are in just the position where they see all its faults with the clearness born of a union of intimacy and detachment . Moreover , reformers seldom see the best side of what they are reforming . If they did they might not be reformers . But the result is that reforms are always misunderstood and often harmful . At present the home is in a hard position , suffering from attack on the part of the feminists , as though it , too , were an exclusively ' man-made ' institution , and suffering equally from defense on the part of certain conservatives , who bring to the discussion a sentimentality and an obliviousness to facts that is singularly unhelpful . The home is , of course , not entirely man-made . And the aspects of it which justify , if anything justifies , such criticism as this of Mr. George 's , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , men who , just as they like t heir wives to dress showily , like also to have their homes managed showily . It is a form of ostentation that feeds their pride . But with most men , the simpler a home is , the better they like it . Were men ever the happier because the patchwork quilts in their houses took months to make ? Maggie Tolliver , a feminist of her own day , called it ' foolish work , cutting things apart and then sewing them together again , ' and so THE UNKNOWN QUANTITY IN THE WOMAN PROBLEM 517 perhaps it was . So was a good deal of work done in the home . Whatever drove women into it , ? whether a per- cried inventiveness , a cramped and hedged-in zest for creation , or merely the ostentation of industry , ? whatever it was , it was certainly not the urgency of the men . But if the women of the past inolved themselves and their homes in a tangle of self-imposed detail , the women of the future are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an expression , ' to throw out the child with the bath , ' that is a very suggestive one , and seems to belong just here . What I mean is , that in simplifying the home , in eliminating , in delegating , we must be careful not to lose the home itself . And of this we are much greater danger than were our grandmothers , in spite of their foolish patchwork . We sometimes allow our- ' selves to pity our great-grandmothers . I am not so sure that we are right . Materially their lives were harder , but spiritually , perhaps , they were easier . The home , if it is anything , is a spiritual reality . But we are so constituted that we have to get at the spiritual through the physical . Generosity , courage , purity ? it is only in the old Moralities that we meet these face to face . and we know how cold the meeting is . It is not generosity that stirs us , but a cup of water passed on by the ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more strongly than his own desire . Courage is a name , but to get its thrill we think of the other English gentleman walking quietly out of the storm-bound tent into the Antarctic night , that by his death he might give his friends a better chance for life . So with the other values of life . In proportion as they are spiritual they are not won by direct assault . Wealth may be won , but not happiness ; bodily health , but not health of the soul . If we spend ourselves in clearing an open path to what we want , ? cutting away the tangle of importunities that seem to hold us back , trampling down and hurling aside whatever threatens to trip us , ? the more thoroughly we do this , the more likely is it that as we go forward briskly along the cleared way we shall discover that there is nothing ahead ? the path leads nowhere . The things we most care for ? the spiritual rewards ? seem to come always as byproducts . It is a little like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it arises through the vehicle of the physical . We may not be able to track it down to any one material aspect . Sleeping under one roof does not make a home ; eating together does not make a home ; gathering about a common lamp or a common fireplace does not ; possibly even children in a nursery can not make a home . We may eliminate one or another of these and still keep the spiritual thing that we prize . Sometimes we must eliminate , when the very multitude of its outward signs blur the real meaning ? you can not see the woods for the trees . But a proverb usually needs a supplementary gloss , and in this one it should be added that without trees there will be no woods . And so , in the case of the home , if in one extreme there is danger of submerging its significance in the mass of its physical expressions , there is at the other extreme the danger of dissipating significance through a paucity of physical expression . It is the second danger which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ' I imagine the Feminist home rather as a large block of flats in a garden over a common restaurant ; the staff is directed by an elected manageress and her deputy . . . a competent kitchen staff , under a well-paid chef , prepares 518 THE UNKNOWN QUANTITY IN THE WOMAN PROBLEM table d'hate meals for the lazy and a lengthy a la carte bill for the fastidious . . Everything that can be done to throw the business of the household upon a salaried staff is done . ' To most people this proposition will seem a reduetio ad absurdum for the whole feminist programme . ' If this is what Feminism means , let us have no more of it . ' And it is not only the conservatives who will say this . But let us hope that Mr. George 's bleak plan for us is not the only one possible . Even at a first glance one might almost predict that nothing so cheap and easy as his Feminist Flats could embody a solution of society 's problem . And the more I consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the home would be a betrayal of the home . ' Clear the way for a real home , ' he says in effect , ' with leisure to realize it . ' Very well . The way is clear : the kitchen is gone , the cookery is delegated , the cleaning is delegated , the nursery is eliminated . These things are in the hands of experts , and the family , having been marshaled by experts through its communal day , comes together , if at all , at its close ( there seems no chance before ) , in the sitting-room of its own flat , and says , ' Let us now , being at leisure , and free from petty cares , get a real sense of home . ' This is what I have called bleak . If I were confronted with the alternative of achieving a sense of home through leisure and no work or through work and no leisure , I should choose the second . I believe that you can give a child , and get for yourself , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and picking up wood for the fire , and coming in and making it , and sweeping up the floor afterwards , and then , perhaps , having only five minutes left in which to sit down by it and read him a story , than you will by sitting down with him in a dustless room before a steam-radiator heated , with no trouble to you , from a central plant , and having a whole hour of leisure in which to read him many stories . And even if in the first case you had to use up all your time , so that you had to tell the child his story while you lugged in the wood , and even if you and the child were both very tired when all was done , whereas before the steam-radiator you would both have felt quite fresh ? even so , I still believe the sense of home would be stronger and worth having at the price . That is one of the reasons why I do not think we need to pity our great-grandmothers . It evidently comes down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is , on the one hand , such a thing as ' real life , ' and on the other ' stultifying detail . ' Real life is desirable , stultifying detail is despicable . Therefore we must , so far as possible , get rid of detail , in order to make room for real life . The other theory , which I find much more useful , is that life is felt only through detail . Detail is stultifying only if it is not vitalized . Our lives are enveloped in it as we are in the air we breathe ; they express themselves through it ; it is their medium . In one sense , then , there is no such thing as ' real life ' ; but in another and truer sense , there is nothing else . Therefore , there is no point in trying to escape detail . The only escape is in turning to it , meeting it , using it . Concretely , the detail of home-management is not to be despised and evaded , it is to be valued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it an obstacle . I consider it both a means and an end . But if his plan is a betrayal of the home it is so not through inadvertence . He means to betray it . He regards the individuality of the home as a fetter , the privacy of the home as a menace , the sacredness of the home as a fetich . But I hope it is possible to wish for women many of the things which he wishes , and yet to see in the individuality of the home a stimulus , in its privacy an opportunity , and in its sacredness an inspiration . There is , however , no use in blinking the fact that some of Mr. George 's reforms are in line with actual economic movement . It is more his spirit than his matter that gives offense . The communal flat is not yet here , but we are a good deal nearer to it than men our grandfathers would have deemed possible . The exodus of home occupations out of the home and into the hands of organized labor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but is proceeding with gathering momentum . Not only light but heat , and even hot water , are being furnished from an outside plant . The vacuum cleaner , which comes at our summons , has revolutionized housecleaning . Probably one third of the kitchen work has gone , or , for households that patronize bakeries , perhaps one half . And this is the result , not of feminist-driven reform , but of general economic changes . Neither feminists nor reactionaries have either helped or hindered it . But what the final effect on the home is to be depends somewhat on the attitude of the homemakers ? the men and the women and the children who are coming . There is no question that the immediate result has been to lighten enormously the home labor of women , and either to send them out of the home in pursuit of other occupation , or to leave them in the home , high and dry , with hands idle or occupied only with work which has been rather artificially concocted to fill them . How this is affecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , whether it is developing some group-form of social life other than the family form , and whether this would be a good thing or a bad thing ? these are questions which we can not help debating even though we have as yet few data to go on . But in this connection it might be worth while to scrutinize rather carefully one assumption , ? the assumption that the best way for society to do things is through experts . I do not say , the best way for it to get things done . It does not require much scrutiny to discover that if we want any particular thing done in the best way we must go to the expert . The question is , whether this is the best way for society to do things . It is rather generally assumed that it is . And yet there is another theory which casts a doubt upon this : the theory that it is better for any one to do many things for himself , even if he does them rather badly , than for him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We all recognize this about children . It is better for a child to wash his own hands , even though the thumbs are neglected and a grayish water-line is left at the wrist , than for him to have them washed for him , though they come out immaculate ? and with no water-line . It all depends on whether your eyes are fixed on the people who are doing the things or on the things they are doing . If it is the things , go to the expert . If it is the people , do n't . Possibly even the things suffer in the long run . Manufacturers here and there are beginning to suspect this . After having worked for years toward greater and greater specialization of labor , they are now beginning to suspect that they are suffering from a loss of quality in their laborers , who compare unfavorably with the all-round ' worker , and they are casting about for a remedy . In other words , specializa- 520 THE UNKNOWN QUANTITY IN THE WOMAN PROBLEM tion may be good for production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind we should review the question of home-management by experts , we might decide that , though something will be gained , something also may be sacrificed . It is not enough to prove that it would make for economy and efficiency in heating , lighting , cleaning , catering . It might do all this , and still the gain might be outweighed by the loss . Just a word , finally , about fathers and husbands . It is not the fashion to talk about them much . Mr. George speaks of the child as the expression of the feminine personality . ' He says , ' The wife should die in child-birth , and the mother rise from her ashes . ' Why can not the husband also die , and the father rise from his ashes ? And there would be Father and Mother face to face , which is all of Husband and Wife , and something more . It is even better than a mother , with a father as ' mere excrescence . ' Here is a curious bit of thinking . Beginning with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal , Mr. George 's argument somehow slides off into an assumption of a difference incredibly great ? the difference between a mother militant or triumphant , and a father excrescent . This is bewildering . For many of us have supposed that the development of fatherhood has been one of the main lines of social progress ; that the goal which society has been working toward is the equal comradeship of man and woman . If it is important to achieve this as regards all other as pects of life , why should we deliberately throw it away in the one that touches us most deeply ? It is worth any price , it is what spiritualizes passion , and makes of marriage something a thought more wonderful than friendship . And now to forget , ? to be blind to the beauty , the infinite desirability of men and women standing together as regards the most precious thing they can create and possess , the child , ? any one who can do this would seem to have strayed so far as to have forfeited all claim to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidance ? None of us sees the path clearly . We are hardly sure of the next step , but if we are not right about this , then we do not even know which way we are facing . This is why the note of sex-antagonism in suffrage argument ought to be deeply deplored and sternly repressed . It is a false note . Class-antagonism we have . Perhaps we shall have class-war . To some this seems inevitable , to others probable , to all it seems possible , because even with the extinction of one class , society could still go on . But it is not possible for one sex to wish the extinction of the other . The well-being of each is bound up with the well-being of the other , and we must distrust every leader who does not recognize first of all that , wherever safety lies , it does not lie in separation or hostility . Society is like a bird with two great wings , woman and man . It has not been able to fly very well because one of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming to its full strength . Will it help , then , to cripple the other wing ?
