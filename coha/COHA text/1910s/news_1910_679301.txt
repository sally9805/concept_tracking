txt Probably the speeches Tennessee delivered at the dinner Teaches of the Tennessee Society . Lesson have been often equaled , a as oratory , and perhaps they have sometimes been surpassed on more than one such occasion , but they were at least different , and different , too , in a way that made the contrast both refreshing and commendable . For the Tennesseeans abandoned , and for the first time , so far as we remember , since State and county dinners began to be held in this city , the custom of praising the old home at the expense of the new one . ' Usually , if not ' invariably , the praise has been of such lyrical , not to say hysterical , enthusiasm that everybody except the diners themselves has been filled with wonder as to why the orators and those who applauded their resonant periods ever came away from the earthly paradises in which they originated , and with a still greater wonder why they remained for ' one unnecesary instant in a place so inferior in everything , front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared New York to be . Of course , the very fact that these people were'dining here instead ' of many and many a mile to the north or the west or the south , has always been convincing proof that they did n't really mean more than half they said  --  that they came here and staid here for the sufficient reason that here they could get along better and be happier than they could at home . Now , the Tennesseeans did n't say quite this in so many words , but they did very frankly and honestly confess that they were living here , not as miserable exiles from the only region where life was worth yvhile , but as affectionateAnterested , and appreciative sons by choice and adoption in a great city of great opportunities . And that was novel ? it was also generous and fine . It is all right to maintain a strong sentimental regard for the State , and even for the town or village , in which one was born , but it is not all right , or right at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretend that it is something else  --  that it Is , for instance , a passionate regret and longing for the loved and lost . That 's just nonsense , and silly , ungrateful nonsense . People come to New York because they want to , and unless they want to stay here they go away . Those who do remain should be as mannerly as were the sons of Tennessee , fog there is as much of obligation on a guest as on a host to be courteous . Something of a shock ? Immigration will be created in many and Its minds by the news that as the result of its long Restriction . labors the Immigration Commission has prepared a report advising , in effect , that measures be taken the result of which would be to bar from the United States many immigrants who would now be allowed to land here in time to become citizens . We are all either immigrants or the descendants of immigrants , and at first thoughyt seems ungenerous , and even unfair , to deny to others the privilege of entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The legal right , however , to impose upon immigration any restrictions we choose is unquestionable , and the moral right to do so is limited , if it be limited , only by the duty to impose no restrictions not founded on a reasonable , enlightened , and decent regard for self-interest , That does n't mean that we should cease to act in this matter of immigration , as in others , from high motives  --  self-interest , properly understood , does not forbid , but commands , that . What it does mean is that , there having been in this country a great change from the early conditions that made it expedient as well as safe to let in anybody who wanted to come , we must recognize that expediency and safety - have - changed with the conditions , and that we must guard our gates . It would be n6 favor to the ' world to let our present population be submerged by a flood of ? " undesirables , " for what would our welcome then be worth , even to the desirables ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not desirable . On that point opinions can differ widely and honestly .. and some of the tests suggested by the commission  --  that as to reading and writing , for instance  --  are certainly debatable , But it is not a change of policy that the Commissioners suggest ; it is only an extension in no very great degree of a reHtrictive policy long since adopted . We already keep out not a few would-be immigrants and send back not a few whom , - after they have been here a while , we find it unprofitable to keep . From our decis- , tors in neither case is there any legitimate appeal except to our own revised or better jildgment . ? With that judgment , as shown by the unvarying tendency of our immigration legislation for many years past , the recommendations of the Commissioners are in accord ? so far as direction goes . Not all the qualifications they advise.us to deviand may be worth demanding , and . in their place it , may be . wise , to put otherswhich did . net ** @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sentimental.  - -  From many quarters Invention come murmurings , faint Makes as yet , but steadily growTrouble. ing louder , uttered by the ancient and honorable company of barbers . They are discontented , and with a discontent added k to the general discontent of the time . Their grievance is special , bitter , in that they must do something about it and there seems to be nothing that can be done . For unzumbered centuries the endless task of foiling Nature 's determination to put beards on the faces of men has been accomplislied by means of a tool which seemed to be incapable of , improvement ' in anything except materAl . The steel has been bettered , but the form has remained , and ever the use of the razor has demanded a peculiar skill , unattainable by the multitude . Hence barbers . ISTdi denly the impossible has been accomplished , and the razor has a rival , the so-called safety razor . It does the work as well as the old razor , does it more quickly  --  and anybody can use it ! At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new implement solemnly asseverates , , and thougjt there is something of exaggeration in these claims , there is so little that the difference has been ignored by thousands and thousands of men who in the past never thought of shaving themselves . Hence the moans of the barbers , hence their determination to do something lest they all be reduced to mere cutters of hair , which means ruin for many of them and a great and permanent reduction of their numbers . The case is hard , but many another trade and profession has had the same experience as a result of invention .
