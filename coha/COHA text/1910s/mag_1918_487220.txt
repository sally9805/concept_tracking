low one of our 2,400 , a private of the C. E. F. , from the moment when , incapacitated from further service , he finds himself on Canadian soil again , to the moment when , turning the last page of his great chapter , he becomes merged once more in civilian life . Awaiting him in Edmonton ( as , of course , in any other Canadian town , were he bound elsewhere ) are a variety of organizations interested in his return . Some of these , such as the Red Cross , the St. John 's Ambulance , and the V. A. D. , have been primarily concerned with his welfare overseas , but these and the next-of-kin are eager to share in his welcome home . His companions who have preceded him . and who have organized themselves into a local branch of the Great War Veterans Association are ready to greet him . The local authorities and the next-of-kin were notified by wire when our soldier entered the special train which has been bearing him on his long journey across the continent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many , he will be amply met . At the railway station space is roped off for his family and friends , and around the enclosure gather other citizens who have come to take part in the welcome . From these scenes , as they have been any time these last two years , certain faces haunt one 's memory . Down in the southern city of Calgary , the distributing point for the Province , a quaint old woman used to meet the trains when soldiers came in . She had no ' sons at the front for whose return she might be watching . She had no money to give to the patriotic fund . But she had  --  a cornet , on which she could play one tune , " Keep the Home Fires Burning , " and every time the soldiers came in , she got off in a corner of the station and played her tune . As the branch-line train with the soldiers on it came up from Calgary to Edmonton , it was boarded at one or me little stations aown Lne line ay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to many of the Edmonton boys when they were training here at the beginning . As a " Y " secretary , he was with them still in England and France , and in France his own son was killed . It is written in his fine old face that these men who ' are coming back are also his sons , and ashe went from seat to seat in the trainduring these last few hours of their journey and welcomed them and planned with them for their welfare , they did not fail to read what was written there . Times - change and faces change with them . The fragile old man - is in England now , but he remains a part of the picture ; for he has simply moved on to-the beckoning finger-tip of the long arm which the home-town stretches overseas . But we return to our soldier at the railway station . If he is - incapacitated , an ambulance bears him directly to the Military Hospital . If , as in the majority of cases , he can get abou-Lbut still needs hospital treatment , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the Mayor greets him with - a word of welcome , and his comrades gather around him . Here , too , temporary accommodations are provided ' for him if he lives out of town . Thence he is borne to his home , Where the soldier enjoys a ten days ' leave of absence before reporting to the military authorities . If his condition is such that he can continue tolie an " outpatient , " he reports thenceforth at regular intervals for medical treatment . He is still serving under the colors , still wears his uniform , and- may not seek other employment until his discharge . For many a man , however , with health shattered by gas or shell shock , or with wounds requiring constant attention , hospital or convalescent home is the only resource . As I write , there are three hundred such cases in the local hospital , and they will , of course , multiply enormously as time goes on . When the hospital first began to fill , a quiet professor of mathematics at the university suddenly turned himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a song to sing or a joke to crack or a story to tell was hunted to his lair by ' this indefatigable spirit . From these beginnings he twenty on to the coOrdination of the various elements wishing to " do something " for the returned soldier , until now the erstwhile devotee of conic sections has become the mainspring of a concerted activity remarkable for its harmonious cooperation . . Meanwhile , our soldier is slowly convalescing , has joined the local branch of the G. W. V. A. , and is beginning to think of his future . At present the returned soldier remains under the charge and absolute authority of the Canadian Army Medical Corps until the time of - his discharge . Of Dominion scope again is the Invalided Soldiers Commission , which- has to do with vocational training and with further medical treatment of the soldier in case he undergoes a physical relapse after his discharge . Cooperating with these is the Returned Soldiers Commission of the Province of Alberta , which consists of the Premier , three members nominated by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. One would imagine that it would take a hardy broth to survive this multiplicity of cooks , but fortunately it is the individual , not the red tape that counts . The Secretary of the Provincial Returned Soldiers Commission , himself an old-timer and , again , , fortunately , a civilian , is the saving grace in this complexity . He cuts red tape by ignoring it , and is alike beloved by the soldiers and indispensable to the authorities . Through him our soldier 's way is smoothed as he struggles with his complicated relations with the authorities and , emerging from the hospital , turns his face , forward to the problem of fitting himself once more for civilian life . During his stay in the Convalescent Home , our soldier , if he is not already master of a trade , has been , encouraged to begin vocational - training. * When restored to health he is sent on to the Dominion Technical School in Calgary , or to the vocational school in Edmonton or the College of Agriculture of the University . Meanwhile , a vocational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is added to his regular pay. ? At the end of this period , equipped with ' the necefflary technical knowledge , he need have no fear . In a new and rapidly developing country , which was suddenly stripped of its man-power , there will be no dearth of opportunities . V , on the other hand , the soldier is ready to seek a position at once , without waiting for the vocational training , the Returned Soldiers Commission and the G. W. V. A. stand behind him . All available sources of employment  --  banks , department stores , and small shops , factories , agencies , and mines  --  have been brought into coOperation.t It is impossible to mention the G. W. V. A. without paus- *At present this privilege is granted only to those who have had no previous special training , or whose physical disabilities prevent their resuming their former trade . It is characteristic of the activities of the G. W. V. A. that they are now urging upon the Government the extension of this opportunity to those who already have a trade but-wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As an instance of local codperatIon , it is worth- noting that the Edmonton Board of Trade prints , as a part of its letterhead for all correspondence , a reminder that " the G. W. V. A. conducts an employment bureau . Give the veterans the first chance . " ing to reflect on the enormous significance this organization and the corresponding organization , sure to develop on American soil , will have on-the future of the two countries . What part the American organization may be expected to play is outside of my text . With the numbers already enlisted in the States and the enormous additions which will probably have to be made , that influence can not fail to be great ; and it is possible of course that enlistments may ultimately reach such a proportion that the story of the G. A. R. in the twenty years following the Civil War may be parallelled . But the army now contemplated in the States , large as it- is , bears of course no such proportion to the total population as the army which sparsely populated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , look about us , the-question that rises to our lips is not so much , " Who has gone ? " as " Who has not gone ? " And when these thousands/ come back , with a basis of organization and a sense of solidarity such as no mere political-party has ever afforded , there seems no imaginable limit to the power for good or ill which they can and will exert . The present membership of the G. W. V. A. in Canada , about 25,000 , is , of course , only the thin edge of the wedge ; but their monthly magazine , the Veteran , contains in its opening number- the significant announcement that it proposes not merely to concern itself with " problems and news more closely affecting returned soldiers , " but also " fearlessly and strenuously to attack all proven abuses and ? injustices in our national administration and public life , and lend its independent support to all sane and enlightened policies of reform and progress . " If the G. W. V. A. can really be independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitable danger of becoming a political tool , there is literally no limit to the good it can do in a country where there is surely room for purgation ; and there is also food for reflection in the thought that the two G. W. V. A. 's which will develop on either side of the international boundary , consisting of men who have fought shoulder to shoulder , will:develop an intellectual and spiritual reciprocity between the two nations  --  which will utterly transcend any mere economic relations . ' Meanwhile , with-the fruition of these great matters still in the future , the little community has been doing what it could . The efforts have seemed like mere gropings in the dark , and the waiting was not easy . But the darkness was occasionally irradiated and the tedium relieved by experiences which enlarge one 's faith in human nature . Boys come back , still boys in mere tale of years , but in all else veterans . Perhaps the sense of this sort of thing comes home more intimately to those of us who teach than to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental processes of the student and we catch ourselves wondering how ' minds so immature and apparently so deficient in analytical ability and power of expression can ever cope adequately with serious things . The great call comes . They volunteer , don khaki , and go , and still we wonder a little . Then news begins to filter back of how this boy or that has displayed a man 's resourcefulness and a hero 's courage , and how all of them , whether chance ' has distinguished them or ? not , have done their duty . That would be enough-in itself to teach us humility , but one thing remains to clinch the lesson . Slowly as the months of long agony of war.grow into years , many of those boys who seemed so incurably young are invalided home and meet us in the halls or reappear in our - classrooms . They bear external marks of what they hive been through but these marks are as nothingcompared to what is written on their souls . They conduct themselves naturally enough . There is n't a suspicion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reticence . But in all their demeanor and in every word they say , they are men  --  not merely technically but literally , veterans . Here is one instance out of , the many that crowd upon my thought . Among the sophomores is a quiet unassuming boy in civilian garb . Save for a shattered hand , there is nothing to mark him for what he is  --  a veteran of the Princess Pats . He has taken up his education at the early stage where he left it when the call came . He was no genius when he went away , and his experience has wrought no sea-change in him . But when he comes , into contact with life as it is portrayed in literature , he judges it as a man judges . And there is a power of illumination in these boys that transcends speech . They have possessed themselves of a demesne of grim realities beside which one 's own little plotted field seems pitifully insignificant . I had been reading Barbusse 's " Under Fire " and the concentrated horror of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination than a credible thing . I met this boy next day with the book in his hand and phrased my doubt to him . " The story is true , every word if it " he said , very quietly and soberly . I read the book ovez%then and peopled it with the boys  --  those incredibly young boys  --  whom I knew so well . There are many lessons to be learned in this new world which is a-making . The great ones  --  economic , social , and moral  --  are , for those who have the wider vision . But even to those of ' us who move within the narrow academic circle , the war comes home in unexpected ways . And it will be no inconsiderable gain if , by it , we shall have attained to a better knowledge of what is the true measure of a man :
