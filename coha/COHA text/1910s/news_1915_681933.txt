txt An organized campaign for conscription will be I started in England next week . All Lord Northcliffe 's energy and mediums I of publicity , it is said , will be devoted to this purpose . Lord Northcliffe 's plans have been in the making for some time . By means or , his papers he has long been preparing the ground . He will now organize an extension of the campaign in the I direction of public meetings , lectures , demonstrations , and so forth , which are intended to reach those of the population throughout the country among whom his newspapers do not circulate . He has enlisted the support of many influential persons , including , it is reported , more than one Cabinet Minister . His chief support , it is said , will come from David Lloyd George , the Munitions Minister , who will , it is expected , come out at the crucial moment with a declaration that conscription is necessary ro victory . Lord Northcliffe will not be allowed to have it all his own way . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known to the anti-conscriptionists , and counterplans have been arranged on an , extensive scale . It will be a battle royal and prediction of the result can not be made . Several Ministers have admitted more or less specifically that if it were proved that conscription were a necessary step to victory , they would not oppose it . With the majority of the members of the present Coalition Cabinet , however , the point made is that voluntary enlistment has not yet been proved a failure . There can be no objection to stating , as has been stated in the press here , that the voluntary enlistment system still continues to bring in more men than it is possible to equip , even at this stage of the war . From one point of view this is an argument in favor of conscription , for it is argued that were compulsion the law of the land , them . would have been by this time no inadequacy of equipment . It is on this aspect of the question that Lloyd George is believed to be in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compulsory service . Some of Lord Northcliffe 's political and journalistic opponents profess to see in his coming campaign a scheme to bring about the downfal of the present Cabinet . Their belief is based on the assumption that the Coalition Cabinet , as at present constituted , would not agree to bring in a compulsory service bill . Premier Asquith in particular is believed to be a strong adherent of voluntary enlistment , which , he thinks , has shown Great Britain to be animated with a spirit of patriotism such as no amount of misrepresentation can depreciate in the eyes of the intelligent world . Should the coming campaign produce popular effervescence , which the existing Government could not afford to disregard , then , it is argued , Mr. Asquith and the other Ministers who think as he does would be obliged to resign their posts in order to , make way for a Government which would carry out the popular behest . That , according to his opponents , is really the object which Lord Northcliffe has in view . His friends , on the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he Is convinced that only compulsory service can bring into play the whole might of Great Britain in what is recognized to be a life and death struggle .
