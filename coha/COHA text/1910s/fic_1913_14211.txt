Scene explained on diagram later . At rise of curtain the stage is bare . No lights on the stage except the rays of the moon shining through glass door and the sky above . The wind is heard howling outside . The effect is that of a terrific storm taking place . Everything within the scene proves that it is a deserted , desolate spot ; in fact , an inn , a summer resort on the mountains closed for the winter . After thirty seconds ELIJAH QUIMBY appears at glass door upstage and is seen swinging a lantern . He does this as if guiding someone who is following ; a sort of signal to MRS . QUIMBY , who presently appears trudging behind him . He hands her the lantern while he fumbles with a bunch of keys he has taken from his pocket . She gives him a light from the lantern while he finds the right key and unlocks the door . As the door swings open the wind is heard howling unmercifully . He holds the door open for her to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They both stamp their feet to get them warm . MRS . QUIMBY goes down R. C. , holding up lantern and peering around room , then goes down R. C. , holding up lantern and peering around room , then goes up R. and to C. and down to table L. , on which she places the lantern . QUIMBY , after locking the door goes slowly down L. to table , meanwhile stamping feet , removing ear-muffs and placing cap and mittens on table . MRS . QUIMBY removes her mittens , and they both stand rubbing their hands and ears . All this business is done without a word being spoken . The reason for it is to prove to the audience that the night is bitterly cold and that the two people are half frozen after their climb up the mountain . ELIJAH QUIMBY ( At table L. , right of MRS . QUIMBY , shivering . ) You know , Mother , I think it 's colder in here than it is outside . p. 3 MRS . QUIMBY ( Shivering . ) I was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe we 'd better open the door and let in some warm air . MRS . QUIMBY You 'd better not ; the snow 'll blow all over the place . See if there 's any logs over there and we 'll build a fire . ( Indicates fireplace with a nod of her head . ) ELIJAH QUIMBY ( Starts R. , stops and stamps his feet . ) You know , Mother , I think my feet are froze . I ca n't feel ' em when I walk . ( Knocks hands together . ) TOWN CLOCK READY . MRS . QUIMBY I do n't wonder , after that climb up the mountain . Lord , I 'll never forget this night . I 'm about perished . ( She straightens chairs , etc. , while QUIMBY is looking for logs . ) Any logs there ? ELIJAH QUIMBY Yep , plenty of ' em . I got this thing all ready , anyway . I was goin ' to build a fire when I was up here last week . I 'll have ' em blazin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Searches through his pockets . ) I can swear I put a box of ' em in my pocket before I left the house . ( Finds them . ) Yep , here they are . p. 4 MRS . QUIMBY You 'd better light a lamp first so 's you can see what you 're doin ' . ELIJAH QUIMBY That 's a good idea . ( Clock in distance strikes eleven while he is scratching match and lighting lamp over fireplace R. ) ( Note .  --  Footlights up slightly when lamp is turned up . ) MRS . QUIMBY ( Standing at foot of stairs . ) Eleven o'clock . ELIJAH QUIMBY Yep , that 's what it is  --  eleven o'clock . ( Goes upstage and looks through glass door . ) That train 's been in over twenty minutes already . I suppose it 's the storm that delays him . ' Tai n't over a ten-minute walk up the mountain from the depot . ( Comes down R. C. ) MRS . QUIMBY ( Goes to R. near desk . ) Maybe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ QUIMBY No ; I heard it signal the crossing at Asquewan Junction a half hour ago . That feller 'll be here before we know it . ( Hands her matches . ) Light the other lamp , will you , Mother , while I get at this fire ? ( MRS . Q. takes matches and lights lamp up L. near stairway . He builds fire in fireplace . Both are busily engaged in fixing room , heating and lighting it during following conversation : ) p. 5 MRS . QUIMBY Maybe we should have gone to the depot to meet him . ELIJAH QUIMBY ( Going C. ) No ; we should n't have done nothin ' of the kind . The telegram just said to come here and to open up the place and have it ready for him . Them 's the instructions , and them 's the only things I foller  --  is instructions . ( Starts toward R. ) MRS . QUIMBY ( Going C. ) But what do you suppose anybody wants to be doin ' in a summer hotel on the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother , you know I ca n't figger out nothin ' . ( Goes up to door , peers out , then comes down to MRS . Q. ) If I could I 'd a been a multi-millionaire years ago instead of an old fool caretaker . ( Goes nearer to MRS . Q. ) Dust up a bit there , will you . Mother , and make the place look a little respectable . ( Goes toward fireplace . ) She 'll be goin ' all right in a minute now . MRS . QUIMBY ( Dusting with cloth she has taken from foot of stairs . ) What 's his name again ? ELIJAH QUIMBY Magee , I think the telegram says . ( Meets MRS . Q. at C. ) p. 6 MRS . QUIMBY Magee ? ELIJAH QUIMBY Wait a minute , I 'll make sure . ( Takes telegram from his pocket . ) MRS . QUIMBY ( Takes telegram from him and goes L. ) Give it to me ; I want to read it myself . The whole thing 's very mysterious to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of lantern . ) ELIJAH QUIMBY ( Goes toward MRS . Q. FIRE BEGINS TO BLAZE UP . ) Of course it 's mysterious , but it 's none of our business . Mr. Bentley is the owner of Baldpate Inn . If Mr. Bentley wants to permit some darn fool to come to this place to be froze to death by stale air and to be frightened to death by spooks , it 's his concern and not ours . ( Turns and looks at fire , which is blazing . ) Ah , there she goes , she 's blazing up fine . That 'll warm it up a little . ( Goes L. C. to MRS . Q. during next speech . ) MRS . QUIMBY ( Reading message slowly . ) " My friend , William Hallowell Magee , will arrive in Asquewan Falls to-night on the ten-forty . He will occupy Baldpate Inn , so be prepared to receive him there , and turn the key over to him and do whatever you can to make him comfortable . He has important work to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions . Ask no questions . Hal Bentley . " p. 7 ELIJAH QUIMBY ( Has been listening attentively . ) Sounds like them Black Hand notes they send to rich men , do n't it ? MRS . QUIMBY I ca n't understand it for the life of me . ( Hands telegram back to QUIMBY . ) ELIJAH QUIMBY ( Thinks . ) Mother ! MRS . QUIMBY ( Over to QUIMBY C. ) Yes ? ELIJAH QUIMBY ( R. of C. ) Maybe the feller 's committed some crime and is comin ' here to hide . MRS . QUIMBY Do you think so , Elijah ? ELIJAH QUIMBY I do n't know ; I say  --  mebbe . MRS . QUIMBY Well , if that 's so , why should Mr. Bentley be interested in such a man ? ELIJAH QUIMBY ( Thinks . ) I never thought of that . ( Thinks . ) Well , whatever it is , it 's none of our business , and we must n't mix in other people 's affairs . ( Goes R. ) MRS . QUIMBY ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Elijah ! p. 8 ELIJAH QUIMBY ( Looks up . ) What ? MRS . QUIMBY Do you think I 'd better fix up one of them rooms ? ELIJAH QUIMBY Sure ; he 'll have to have a place to sleep . Here  --  ( Gives her key. ) that opens the linen closet . You 'd better fix up that first room to the left . ( Points to room on balcony R. ) That 's the one Mr. Bentley always takes when he comes . MRS . QUIMBY ( As she goes toward stairs , taking lantern from table . ) And you 'd better put another log on the fire . ( QUIMBY goes toward fireplace . ) He 'll probably be chilled to the bone by the time he climbs that mountain . Do you think he 'll find his way alone ? ( Goes upstairs during speech . ) ELIJAH QUIMBY Oh , he 'll find his way all right . The station agent will most likely direct him . ( Puts log on fire , which blazes up . ) MRS . QUIMBY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel in the dead of winter ! It beats all what some people will do . ( Exits door L. , leaving door open. ) p. 9 ELIJAH QUIMBY ( Takes out his pipe and sits thinking near fire . ) Humph ! It 's pretty darned mysterious , all right . ( Lights pipe and smokes . ) I 'll be jiggered if I can figger it out . ( MRS . Q. remains inside room four counts after cue , then comes from room carrying linen and bed coverings in her arms . She crosses balcony to room R. of balcony and exits , closing door . QUIMBY sits smoking and thinking . MAGEE appears at door upstage and peers through . He is carrying a suit and typewriter case . He puts them down and knocks on window . QUIMBY does n't move at first , but sits listening , to make sure he has heard a sound . MAGEE repeats the knocking . QUIMBY shifts around in his chair , looks up toward the window , sees a form there , then gets up and sneaks along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then calls in suppressed tones to MRS . Q. ) Mother , Mother ! ( No answer from MRS . Q. He runs half way upstairs and calls a bit louder . ) Mother ! MRS . QUIMBY ( Appears on balcony , peers over and sees QUIMBY . ) Did you call me , Elijah ? ELIJAH QUIMBY Hush ! Do n't talk so loud ! ( Warns her to be quiet. ) p. 10 MRS . QUIMBY ( Lowering her voice . ) What 's the matter ? ( They both listen for a second . MAGEE 'S third rap comes . ) Good Lord , what 's that ? ELIJAH QUIMBY ( On stairs . ) It 's him  --  he 's here . ( Points to door upstage . ) MRS . QUIMBY Who ? ELIJAH QUIMBY The telegram  --  I mean the man . MRS . QUIMBY ( Starts down the stairs . ) Where ? ELIJAH QUIMBY At the door . ( MAGEE again raps impatiently . ) MRS . QUIMBY ( Urging QUIMBY down the stairs . ) Why do n't you let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you think I 'd better ? MRS . QUIMBY Well , ai n't that what the telegram said ? ELIJAH QUIMBY Why , yes , of course , but  --  MRS . QUIMBY ( Shoving QUIMBY toward door . ) You got your instructions ; go on and do as you 're told . ( MAGEE knocks again and rattles the door-knob. ) p. 11 ELIJAH QUIMBY ( In a loud voice as he goes up toward door . ) Yes , yes ; jest a minute , jest a minute . ( As he goes up to door , MRS . Q. comes down L. QUIMBY unlocks door and swings it open . The wind howls . MAGEE , carrying the two cases , enters and comes to C. and stands bowing , first to MRS . Q. and then to QUIMBY , then drops the cases in the middle of the stage . Looks around the room for a moment , wild-eyed , then sees fire burning and goes over to it as fast as his half-frozen legs will allow him . He pulls chair in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching him in amazement . As soon as MAGEE has entered QUIMBY has locked the door and come down R. As MAGEE sits , QUIMBY goes to MRS . Q. at L. C. ) MRS . QUIMBY ( Aside to QUIMBY . ) The poor thing 's half froze . ELIJAH QUIMBY ( Approaches MAGEE , MRS . Q. following him to fireplace . ) What 's the matter , young fellow , are you cold ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Smiles a sickly smile , shakes his head , laughs half-heartedly , then replies . ) Humph ! Am I cold ! I feel pretty rocky , but I 've got to laugh at that one . p. 12 MRS . QUIMBY ( Aside to QUIMBY . ) Better give him a drink of whiskey . ELIJAH QUIMBY Yes , I guess so . ( Takes flask from his pocket and hands it to MAGEE . ) Here , young fellow , try a little of this . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Looks up , sees flask , and grabs it . ) Thanks ! ( Takes a long drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . QUIMBY ( Aside to QUIMBY . ) Do you suppose it 's him ? ELIJAH QUIMBY ( Aside . ) How do I know ? MRS . QUIMBY ( Aside . ) Well , ask him and find out . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Offers flask to QUIMBY . ) Thanks again , a thousand thanks . ELIJAH QUIMBY Oh , you just put that in your pocket ; you might need it later on . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Thanks . ( MRS . Q. picks up cases from floor and takes them to table L. ) ELIJAH QUIMBY You 're Mr. Magee , ai n't you ? p. 13 WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Right ! What 's left of me is still Magee . You expected me , of course . ELIJAH QUIMBY Oh , yes ; we got Mr. Bentley 's telegram all right . My name 's Quimby . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE So I surmised . ELIJAH QUIMBY This lady is my wife , Mrs. Quimby . ( Points to MRS . Q. , who crosses to MAGEE at fireplace . ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE I thought as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . Q. without rising . ) MRS . QUIMBY Glad to meet you , Mr. Magee . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE You 'll pardon me for not rising , but really I 'm terribly cold . MRS . QUIMBY ( Goes to QUIMBY during following speech . ) That 's all right . You sit still there and get het up . We 've been living here in the mountains so long we do n't mind the cold as much as strangers do , but even we felt it to-night , did n't we , Elijah ? ELIJAH QUIMBY That 's right , Mother , this is an uncommon cold night . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Rises , removes overcoat , muffler and hat , and places them on chair . ) That little trip from the railroad station to the top of the mountain has taught me to firmly believe everything Jack London ever wrote about and everything old Dr. Cook ever lied about . ( Crosses to L. C. , looking at everything very much interested , and rubbing his hands . ) So this is Baldpate , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . QUIMBY ( R. C. , aside to QUIMBY . ) Do n't he talk funny ? ELIJAH QUIMBY ( L. of MRS . Q. Aside . ) Yes . Acts funny , too . Something 's the matter with him , sure . ( Both watch MAGEE closely . ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Coming C. ) You say you received Mr. Bentley 's telegram saying I would be here ? ELIJAH QUIMBY Yes ; it only came about an hour ago , so we did n't have much time to prepare . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE I did n't decide to come here until four o'clock this afternoon . MRS . QUIMBY We was scared most to death gettin ' a telegram in the middle of the night . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE I 'm very sorry to have taken you out on a night like this , but it was altogether necessary in order that I accomplish what I 've set out to do . Let me see  --  the rooms above are equipped with fireplaces , I believe ? ( Looks up at rooms on balcony . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes ; I 'm just fixin ' up one of the rooms . I 'll start the fire , too . I 'll have it all ready for you inside of five minutes . ( Crosses to R. , gets wood from box , and comes to R. of QUIMBY . ) LIGHTS READY . p. 15 WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE I wish you would . ( Looks around room . ) Yes ; this would be too big a barn to work in . ( QUIMBYS look at each other . ) I 'll no doubt be more comfortable up there . ( Continues to take in surroundings . ) ELIJAH QUIMBY ( Aside to MRS . Q. ) He says he 's goin ' to work . I wonder what he means . MRS . QUIMBY ( Aside , crossing to L. of QUIMBY . ) Pump him . Try to find out . ( Aloud . ) Give me the matches . ELIJAH QUIMBY Here you are . ( He hands her a box of matches . MRS . Q. , with wood in her arms , starts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAGEE This , I presume , is the hotel office . ELIJAH QUIMBY That 's right . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Strolls around stage looking at everything carefully . QUIMBY watching him closely . ) Well , well , this certainly is old John H. Seclusion himself . ( LIGHTS GO UP. ) p. 16 MR . AND MRS . QUIMBY ( Together . ) Good Lord , where did those lights come from ? Good Lord , what 's happened ! ( As lights go up , QUIMBY darts behind desk R. MRS . Q. is leaning over balcony C. Both are frightened . ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Laughs . ) Do n't be alarmed , Mrs. Quimby , it 's all right . I think I can explain this thing . Mr. Bentley has probably had the power turned on . He knew I 'd have to have some real light for this kind of work . ( MRS . Q. exits into room R. on balcony , closing the door . MAGEE goes to QUIMBY up R. ) I suppose you 're wondering what the devil I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was wondering , young fellow . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Well , I 'll try to explain , although I 'm not sure you 'll understand . Sit down , Mr. Quimby . ( QUIMBY hesitates . ) It 's all right , sit down . ( QUIMBY gets chair and places it R. C. , then sits . ) Now , you are not , I take it , the sort of man to follow closely the light and frivolous literature of the day . ELIJAH QUIMBY How 's that ? p. 17 WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE You do n't read the sort of novels that are sold by the pound in the department stores . ELIJAH QUIMBY Nope . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Well , I write those novels . ELIJAH QUIMBY The dickens you do ! WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Wild , thrilling tales for the tired business man 's tired wife ; shots in the night ; chases after fortunes ; Cupid busy with his arrows all over the place . It 's good fun  --  I like to do it , and  --  there 's money in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Oh , yes , considerable . Of course , they say I 'm a cheap melodramatic ranter . They say my thinking process is a scream . Perhaps they 're right . ( Moves chair out and sits L. C. ) ELIJAH QUIMBY Perhaps . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Did you ever read " The Scarlet Satchel " ? ELIJAH QUIMBY Never . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE That 's one of mine . ELIJAH QUIMBY Is it ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE I 've come here to Baldpate to think ; to get away from melodrama , if possible ; to do a novel so fine and literary that Henry Cabot Lodge will come to me with tears in his eyes and beg me to join his bunch of self-made immortals . And I 'm going to do all this right here in this inn , sitting on this mountain , looking down on this little old world as Jove looked down from Olympus . What do you think of that ? p. 18 ELIJAH QUIMBY ( Shakes his head , affecting an air of understanding . ) Maybe it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been running short of material . ( Rises , moves chair to R. of table and goes to QUIMBY . ) I 've needed inspiration . A title gave me that  --  " The lonesomest spot on earth , " suggested by my very dear friend and your employer , Mr. Hal Bentley . " What and where is the lonesomest spot on earth ? " I asked . " A summer resort in winter , " said he . He told me of Baldpate  --  dared me to come . I took the dare  --  and here I am . ELIJAH QUIMBY ( Rising and going so MAGEE at C. ) You mean you 're goin ' to write a book ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE That 's just exactly what I 'm going to do . I 'm going to novelize Baldpate . I 'm here to get atmosphere . ELIJAH QUIMBY ( Laughs . ) Lord , you 'll get plenty of that , all right . When are you goin ' to start in ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Just as soon as I absorb my surroundings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do most of my work in the dead of night . I find I concentrate more readily from midnight on . But I must have absolute solitude . The crackle of the fire , the roar of the wind , and the ticking of my watch will alone bear me company at Baldpate Inn . This all sounds very strange and weird to you , I suppose . p. 19 ELIJAH QUIMBY How 's that ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE I say , you ca n't quite fathom me . ELIJAH QUIMBY Well , you 're here of your own accord , I take it . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE My dear Mr. Quimby , I 'm here on a bet . ELIJAH QUIMBY On a bet ! WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Exactly . I have here an explanation of the thing in Bentley 's handwriting . ( Takes paper from his pocket . ) Do you care to look it over yourself , or would you rather I 'd read it to you ? ELIJAH QUIMBY Yes , go on and read it  --  I like to hear you talk . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Ah , then my personality has wormed its way into your good graces . ELIJAH QUIMBY How 's that ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE I mean to say , I evidently appeal to you . ELIJAH QUIMBY Well , I do n't know as you particularly appeal to me , but  --  WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE But what ? p. 20 ELIJAH QUIMBY ( Laughs , confused . ) Oh , I guess I better not say it . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Come on , what 's on your mind ? Tell me . ELIJAH QUIMBY Well , to be honest with you , I ca n't figger out whether you 're a smart man or a damn fool . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Laughs . ) Would you believe it , my dear sir , I 've been stalled between those two opinions of myself for years . My publishers say I 'm a smart man ; my critics call me a damn fool . However , that 's neither here nor there . This  --  ( Indicating paper ) will perhaps clear away the cloud of mystery to some extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear this also . Will you call her , please ? ELIJAH QUIMBY Sure ! ( Rises and calls . ) Mother , oh , Mother ! MRS . QUIMBY ( Appears at door R. on balcony and comes to C. of it . ) Yes , I 'm all through . Everything 's ready up here . ( Leans over balcony C. ) You 'd better come up , Mister , and see if it satisfies you before we go . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE It 's all right , Mrs. Quimby . I 'll take your word for it that everything 's all right . p. 21 ELIJAH QUIMBY Come on down here , Mother ; Mr. Magee wants to read something to you . ( Places chair for her R. C. next his own . ) MRS . QUIMBY Is that so ? ( Starts downstairs . ) I started the fire , so I guess the room 'll be comfortable enough to sleep in by the time you get ready to go to bed . ( Is downstairs by now . ) ELIJAH QUIMBY Sit down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . See , I 'm sittin ' . ( MRS . Q. goes toward QUIMBY . ) Mr. Magee 's goin ' to tell us why he 's here . MRS . QUIMBY ( Sits L. of QUIMBY . ) Is that so ? Lord , I 'd love to know ! WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE I have just explained to your husband that I am an author . I do popular novels , and I 'm here to write a story  --  a story of Baldpate Mountain , laid in this very hotel , perhaps in this identical room . I am to complete this task within twenty-four hours , starting at mid-night to-night . ELIJAH QUIMBY Understand , Mother ? He 's goin ' to write a book . p. 22 MRS . QUIMBY ( To MAGEE . ) Goin ' to write a book in twenty-four hours ! WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE That is the wager that has been made between Mr. Bentley and myself . He claimed it could n't be done . I claimed it could . Five thousand dollars ' worth of his sporting blood boiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book . I covered the bet , and we posted the checks at the 44th street club . He was to choose the god-forsaken spot . ( Looks around room . ) He succeeded . I ran to my apartments , placed some manuscript paper , a dozen sandwiches and my slippers in a suit-case , grabbed my faithful typewriting machine , just made the train , and here you see me , ready to win or lose the wager , as the case may be . ELIJAH QUIMBY What do you think of that , Mother ? MRS . QUIMBY ( To MAGEE . ) I never heard of such a thing ! WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Here is a copy of the agreement , in which you will notice your name is mentioned , Mr. Quimby . Listen . ( Reads : ) " You are to leave New York City on the 4:55 for Asquewan Falls , arriving at 10:40 , and go direct to Baldpate Inn , a top the Baldpate Mountain , where you will be met by my caretaker , Mr. Elijah Quimby , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key to the inn , the only key in existence . " ( To QUIMBY . ) Is that correct ? p. 23 ELIJAH QUIMBY It 's the only key I know of . MRS . QUIMBY There ai n't no other key ; I can swear to that . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Good ! ( Continues reading . ) " This will insure you against interruption , and give you the solitude necessary for concentration . You are to begin work at 12 o'clock Tuesday night , and turn over to Mr. Elijah Quimby the completed manuscript of a ten-thousand-word story of Baldpate no later than 12 o'clock Wednesday night . " ( To QUIMBY . ) You understand ? ELIJAH QUIMBY You 're to turn it over to me ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Precisely . ELIJAH QUIMBY What do you think of that , Mother ? MRS . QUIMBY I never heard of such a thing ! WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE You know Bentley 's handwriting ; there 's his signature  --  see for yourself . ( Hands paper to MRS . Q. QUIMBYS get up and read it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's his writin ' , ai n't it , Mother ? MRS . QUIMBY ( Doubtfully . ) Looks like it , but  --  ( Looks at MAGEE suspiciously. ) p. 24 ELIJAH QUIMBY ( Aside . ) But what ? MRS . QUIMBY ( Aside . ) The whole thing do n't sound right to me . ELIJAH QUIMBY ( Aside . ) Me neither . We 'd better watch this cuss . MRS . QUIMBY ( Aside . ) I think so , too . ( QUIMBY puts chair up R. MRS . Q. goes toward table L. ' Phone rings . MRS . Q. runs to foot of stairs screaming . QUIMBY hugs the desk , frightened . ) Good Lord ! ELIJAH QUIMBY ( Over to MAGEE up C. ) Did you hear that ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE You mean the telephone ? MRS . QUIMBY ( Runs to MAGEE . QUIMBY grabs MAGEE by the arms . ) Spooks ! ELIJAH QUIMBY Why , that thing 's been out of commission all winter . ( ' Phone continues ringing . MAGEE laughs . ) MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Laughs . ) Do n't be alarmed , Mrs. Quimby ; I think I can explain . Bentley has just about had the service renewed . He probably wants to find out if I 've arrived . Excuse me just a moment . ( Goes to ' phone and stops buzzer . QUIMBYS stand C. watching . ) Hello , hello ! Yes . Yes , right on time . Almost twenty minutes ago . Half frozen , thank you . Yes , he 's here now , also Mrs. Quimby . Oh , we understand each other perfectly well . It 's everything you said it was . The lonesomest spot on earth is right . ( Laughs . ) You still feel that way about it , eh ? Well , your opinion is going to cost you five thousand , old man . ( Laughs . ) All right , we 'll see . You want to talk to him . Just a second . ( To QUIMBY . ) He wants to talk to you , Mr. Quimby. p. 25 ELIJAH QUIMBY ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bentley ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Yes , here you are . Sit right down . ( Hands QUIMBY receiver and goes L. C. taking notes . MRS . Q. goes up R. and listens to ' phone conversation while watching MAGEE . ) ELIJAH QUIMBY ( In ' phone . ) Hello ! ( Smiles as he recognizes Bentley 's voice . ) Hello , Mr. Bentley . Yes , sir ; yes , sir . I understand , sir . At 12 o'clock ? Yes , sir . Oh ! I 'll be right here waiting . Fine , thank you , sir ; we 're both fine . All right , sir . Wait a minute . I 'll ask him . ( To MAGEE , who is on first landing of stairs . ) He wants to know if there 's anything more you want to say ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( On stairs , taking notes . ) No ; just give him my regards , and tell him I 'm spending his money already . ELIJAH QUIMBY ( In ' phone . ) He says there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understand . Good-bye , sir . ( Hangs up receiver and crosses to MAGEE . ) He wants me to be here at 12 o'clock to-morrow night to talk to him on the telephone again . p. 26 WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Laughs as he goes to ' phone and severs connection . ) And it 's very sad news you 'll impart to him , Mr. Quimby . I 'm going to win this wager . ( R. , below ' phone . ) You know this whole thing would n't make a bad story in itself . ( Crossing to L. ) I 'm thinking seriously of using it for the ground plot . ( Points to door L. ) Oh , this leads to where ? ( Goes to door of dining-room L. and opens it . ) MRS . QUIMBY ( Going over toward door . ) That 's the dining-room  --  leads through to the kitchen . That door to the left goes to the cellar . ( Goes back to table L. QUIMBY looks at his watch . ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Ah ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. ) Have you the exact time , Mr. Quimby ? ELIJAH QUIMBY Mine says half past eleven . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Thirty minutes to get my bearings and frame up a character or two for a start . ( Crosses C. to R. C. ) p. 27 MRS . QUIMBY ( Picks up suit-case and machine case from table L. ) Will Input these in your room ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE No , no ; you need n't bother . MRS . QUIMBY Oh , it 's no bother at all . ( Starts for the stairs . ) I 'm only too glad to do anything for any friend of Mr. Bentley . ( Climbs stairs with cases and exits into room R. ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Up to QUIMBY , L. C. ) Now you 're quite sure I wo n't be disturbed while I am writing ? ELIJAH QUIMBY ( L. C. ) Who 's goin ' to disturb you here ? No one ever comes within a mile of this place till around the 1st of April , except myself , and I only come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE You do n't suppose any of Bentley 's Asquewan friends , hearing of the wager , would take it upon themselves to interrupt the progress of my work ? ELIJAH QUIMBY Nobody knows you 're here except me and the Missus , and we ai n't goin ' to tell no one . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE I have your word for that ? ( Offers his hand to QUIMBY. ) p. 28 ELIJAH QUIMBY ( Takes MAGEE 'S hand . ) I never broke my word in my life . Guess that 's why I 'm a poor man . ( MAGEE crosses to R. C. ) The only other time I remember of anybody comin ' here in the winter , was the time of the reform wave at Reuton . The reformers got after a lot of crooked politicians , and they broke in here in the middle of the night and hid a lot of graft money in that safe over there . ( Points to safe . MAGEE goes up to safe , opens the door , then comes down to QUIMBY , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell me the reformers hid money in that safe ? ELIJAH QUIMBY No , the politicians . Reformers never have any money . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Laughs as he goes R. ) Splendid ! ELIJAH QUIMBY What are you laughing at ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Turning back to QUIMBY . ) Nothing ; it 's all right . Go on , tell me about the hidden graft . ELIJAH QUIMBY ( MRS . Q. starts downstairs , bringing lantern and placing it on table L. ) Oh , there 's nothing much to tell . Some fellers up and gave ' em away , and the police come the next morning and found it here . Nobody claimed it , so of course they never got the gang . They threw a lot of fellers out of office , I believe . I did n't read much about it . But that 's over four years ago . You need n't be afraid , you wo n't be disturbed here . ( Goes L. to table and gets his mittens and cap . MRS . Q. is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Going slightly R. ) Grafting politicians  --  reformers  --  hidden money ! Sounds like a good seller . MRS . QUIMBY ( Goes to MAGEE at C. QUIMBY takes lantern and goes back of table . ) Is there anything more we can do for you , Mr. Magee ! WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE No , nothing I can think of , thank you ; I 'll be quite  --  ( Crossing to QUIMBY at table . MRS . Q. to R. C. ) Oh , yes , of course . You 've forgotten something , Mr. Quimby . ELIJAH QUIMBY Forgot what ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE The key . ELIJAH QUIMBY Oh , Lord ! yes , the key ! Here it is . ( Hands MAGEE the key . ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE You 're positively certain that this key is the only key to Baldpate in existence ? ELIJAH QUIMBY Yes , sir ; I 'm sure . MRS . QUIMBY I can swear to it . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Good ! MRS . QUIMBY What are you going to do , lock yourself in ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mind staying here and keepin ' watch for you if you want me to . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE No , thanks ; I much prefer to be alone . MRS . QUIMBY I 'd rather it would be you than me . Lord , I should think you 'd be afraid of ghosts . ELIJAH QUIMBY ( Crosses to MRS . Q. ) Mother , I 've told you twenty times there ai n't no such a thing . ( MAGEE goes up L. ) MRS . QUIMBY Well , they 've been seen here just the same . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Goes L. C. to QUIMBYS . ) Ghosts ! ELIJAH QUIMBY Oh , do n't mind her , Mr. Magee . We think we know what the ghost is . There 's an old feller up here in the mountain by the name of Peters  --  he 's a hermit . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE A hermit ! ELIJAH QUIMBY Yes ; he 's one of them fellers that 's been disappointed in love . His wife run off with a traveling man . He come here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a mile and a half north of here ; calls it the Hermit 's Cave . All the summer boarders buy picture post-cards from him . We figger he 's the feller that 's been frightening the people down in the valley by wavin ' a lantern from the mountain-side with a white sheet wrapped around him . p. 31 MRS . QUIMBY But no one ever proved it was him . ELIJAH QUIMBY Well , who else could it be ? There ai n't no such a thing as ghosts , is there , Mr. Magee ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Well , I hope not . ( Muses . By-play between the QUIMBYS . ) Ghosts  --  hermits  --  not bad at all . ELIJAH QUIMBY Well come along , Mother ; I guess maybe Mr. Magee is anxious to get to work . I 'll say good-night , sir . ( Offers hand to MAGEE . ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Shakes QUIMBY 'S hand . ) Good-night . And remember , 12 o'clock sharp for Mr. Bentley 's ' phone call to-morrow night . ELIJAH QUIMBY I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. ) MRS .

Q. ) p. 32 WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Goes up to door and unlocks it . ) Good-night . I do n't envy you your trip down the mountain on a night like this . ( Opens door . Wind effect . ) MRS . QUIMBY Good-night , sir . ( Starts through door , followed by QUIMBY , carrying lantern . ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Good-night , Mrs. Quimby . Keep a sharp look-out for ghosts and hermits . ( Laughs . ) MRS . QUIMBY ( Outside . ) Lord , do n't remind me , please ! WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Slams door quickly , locks it , waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key in his hand . ) The only one , eh ? Humph , we 'll see ! ( Puts key in his pocket , looks around room , thinks , then claps his hands as if decided on something ; grabs his coat and hat from chair near fire , extinguishes lamps and bracket lights , takes a last look around room , and then exists upstairs into room R. on balcony . ) ( Black Drop Down for Ten Seconds , then right up . The clock strikes 12 . The sound of a typewriter is heard clicking from the room occupied by MAGEE . A short pause of absolute silence , then BLAND appears at door , peering into room. ) p. 33 JOHN BLAND ( Opens door , enters , locks door , then comes down to C. and looks about , rubbing his hands and blowing on them to warm them . Sees safe , goes up to it , tries the door , opens it , and goes down R. As he starts for ' phone he sees fire burning , and stops dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( Thinks , snaps fingers , goes to ' phone and puts in plugs. ) 2875 West . Hurry it along , sister . ( MAGEE enters from room and stands on balcony listening , leaving door of room open . ) ( In ' phone . ) Hello , is that you , Andy ? This is Bland . Yes , Baldpate . Yes , damn near frozen . Oh , awful ! It 's like Napoleon 's tomb . I thought you said Mayor Cargan would meet me here . No , no , I ca n't stay here all night ; I 'd go mad . Listen , I 'll hide the money here in the safe , and meet him at 9 o'clock in the morning and turn it over to him then . There is n't a chance in the world of anything happening . The money 's safer here than any spot on earth . I 'll lock the safe as soon as I put the package in . Mayor Cargan knows the combination . My advice is to let it lay here a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . Besides , how could they get in ? My key to Baldpate is the only one in existence . ( MAGEE , on balcony , takes out his key and looks at it . ) They do n't figure we 'd take the chance after the other exposure . I tell you I know best . I 'll be back in town by one o'clock . I 've got the president 's machine waiting at the foot of the mountain . All right ; good-bye . ( Hangs up receiver , goes C. , takes package of money from his pocket , looks at it and around room , then goes to safe and deposits the money therein . MAGEE starts slowly and stealthily downstairs . BLAND closes door of safe , turns the handle , tries doors to see if they are locked securely , then comes down to fireplace and warms himself . As he turns his back to the fire , he comes face to face with MAGEE , who by this time is standing C. BLAND 'S hand goes to his pocket for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 34 WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Cool and collected . ) Good-evening  --  or perhaps I should say , good-morning . JOHN BLAND ( Keeping hand on gun as he advances toward MAGEE . ) Who are you ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE I was just about to put that question to you . JOHN BLAND What are you doing here ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE I rather think I 'm the one entitled to an explanation . JOHN BLAND Did you follow me up that mountain ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Oh , no ; I was here an hour ahead of you . JOHN BLAND How 'd you get in here ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Points . ) Through that door . JOHN BLAND You lie ! There 's only one key to that door , and I have it right here in my pocket . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE My dear sir , I was laboring under that same impression until a moment ago ; but as your key fits the lock , and my key fits the lock , there are evidently two keys to Baldpate instead of one . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOHN BLAND You mean to tell me that 's a key to Baldpate ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Yes . That 's why I became so interested in your arrival here . I heard you telephone your friend just now and declare that your key was the only one in existence . ( Laughs . ) It sort of handed me a laugh . JOHN BLAND You heard what I said over the telephone ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Every word . JOHN BLAND ( Pulls pistol . ) You do n't think you 're going to live to tell it , do you ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Have no fear on that score . I 'm not a tattle-tale , nor do I intend to pry into affairs that do not concern me . But I should like your answering me one question . Where did you get your key to Baldpate ? JOHN BLAND None of your damned business . I did n't come here to tell you the story of my life . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Well , you might at least relate that portion of it that has led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trespassing , eh ? Who 's trespassing , you or I ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE My right here is indisputable . p. 36 JOHN BLAND Who gave you that key ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE None of your damned business . If I remember rightly , that 's the answer you gave me . JOHN BLAND ( Goes slightly nearer MAGEE . ) You 've got a pretty good nerve to talk like that with a gun in front of your face . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Oh , that does n't disturb me in the least . While I have never experienced this sort of thing in real life before , I 've written so much of this melodramatic stuff and collected such splendid royalties from it all , that it rather amuses me to discover that the so-called literary trash is the real thing after all . You may not believe it , but , really , old chap , I 've written you over and over again . ( Laughs heartily and slaps BLAND on the shoulder . The latter backs away after second slap . MAGEE sits at table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to MAGEE . ) Say , I killed a man once for laughing at me . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE That 's my line  --  I used it in " The Lost Limousine . " 400,000 copies . I 'll bet you 've read it . JOHN BLAND ( Pointing gun . ) If you do n't tell me who you are and what you 're doing here , I 'll kill you as dead as a door nail . Come on , I mean business  --  who are you ? p. 37 WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Well , a name does n't mean so much , so you may call me Mr. Smith . JOHN BLAND What are you ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE A writer of popular novels . JOHN BLAND What are you doing here ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Trying to win a bet by completing a story of Baldpate in twenty-four hours . ( Gets up . ) A few more interruptions of this sort , however , and it 's plain to be seen I 'll pay the winner . ( Up close to BLAND . ) You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by leaving me this place to myself for the night . I give you my word of honor that whatever I 've seen or heard shall remain absolutely sacred . JOHN BLAND ( Sneeringly . ) You must think I 'm an awful fool to swallow that kind of talk . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Very well , if you do n't believe I 'm who I say I am , and you doubt that I 'm here for the reason I gave , go upstairs into that room with the open door  --  ( Points to room R. on balcony . BLAND looks up and backs away. ) and you 'll find a typewriting machine , several pages of manuscript scattered about the floor , and a letter on the dresser from the owner of this inn to the caretaker , proving conclusively that all I 've told you is the truth and nothing but the truth , and there you are . p. 38 JOHN BLAND ( Up close to MAGEE . ) And you 're not in with the police ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE No . I wish I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it is . JOHN BLAND You say you have a letter from the owner of the inn ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Yes . Wait a minute , and I 'll get it for you . ( Starts upstairs , but is stopped by Bland as he is about half way up . ) JOHN BLAND ( Shouts . ) Come back ! WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Comes down and goes to L. C. ) What 's the matter ? JOHN BLAND ( Going L. C. to MAGEE . ) I 've been double crossed before , young fellow . I 'll find it if it 's there . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Oh , very well . If you prefer to get it yourself , why , go right along . ( He turns from BLAND . As he does so , BLAND fans him for a gun . MAGEE turns , surprised ; then as he understands , he laughs . ) You need n't be alarmed ; I never carried a gun in my life . JOHN BLAND But you keep one in your room , eh ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . JOHN BLAND That 's just what I 'm going to do . I guess I 'll keep you in sight , though . Go on ; I 'll let you show me the way . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE All right . ( Starts toward stairs . ) If that 's the way you feel about it , why , certainly . ( Goes upstairs leisurely , followed by BLAND , who keeps him covered . MAGEE starts to exit into room . BLAND stops him . ) JOHN BLAND ( C. of balcony . ) Wait a minute ; I 'll peek around that room alone first . You do n't look good to me ; you 're too damned willing . ( Goes to door of room R. MAGEE steps out to R. of door . ) You wait out here . I 'll call you when I 've satisfied myself you 're not trying to spring something . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Very well . If you do n't trust me , go ahead . ( BLAND exits into room , keeping his eyes fixed on MAGEE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns and slams door quickly , locks it , and runs downstairs to ' phone . When he is half way down BLAND starts hammering on door . ) JOHN BLAND ( Yelling and hammering on door . ) Open this door . ( Hammers . ) Damn you , I 'll get you for this ! p. 40 WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( At ' phone . ) Hello , I want to talk to the Asquewan police headquarters . That 's what I said , police headquarters . ( BLAND pounds on door . As MAGEE sits waiting for connection , MARY NORTON appears at door . She unlocks it and enters , closing door . The cold blast of wind attracts MAGEE , who jumps up and yells : ) Who 's there ? What do you want ? MARY NORTON Do n't shoot ; it 's all right . I 'm harmless . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE How did you open that door ? MARY NORTON ( Slightly down toward MAGEE . ) Unlocked it with a key , of course . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Half aside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) If you will allow me to bring my chaperon inside , I will explain in a moment who I am and why we 're here . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Your chaperon ! MARY NORTON ( Going up to door . ) Yes ; another perfectly harmless female who has been kind enough to accompany me on this wild adventure . ( Turns to MAGEE . ) I have your permission ? p. 41 WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Looks up at room R. , then back at MARY , puzzled . ) Say , what the deuce is this all about ? MARY NORTON You 'll soon know . ( Opens door and calls : ) All right , Mrs. Rhodes . ( MRS . RHODES screams off stage , then enters and runs past MARY to above table L. , terribly frightened . ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE What 's the matter ? What 's happened ? MRS . RHODES ( Shouting to MARY . ) Lock the door ! Lock the door ! ( MARY hurriedly locks door . ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Crosses to MRS . R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is it ? MARY NORTON ( Runs down L. to MRS . R. ) What frightened you , Mrs. Rhodes ? MRS . RHODES ( Almost hysterical . ) A man . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE A man ! MARY NORTON What man ? MRS . RHODES I do n't know . He appeared at the window above flourishing a revolver , and then he jumped to the ground and started running down the mountain side . p. 42 WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Are you sure ? MRS . RHODES Of course I 'm sure . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Just a moment . ( Turns and darts upstairs , taking key from his pocket as he goes . ) MARY NORTON ( Going R. C. with MRS . RHODES . ) Is there anything wrong ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE I 'm beginning to think I am . ( Opens door R. on balcony and exits . ) MRS . RHODES ( Still hysterical . ) Why did you ever come here ? MARY NORTON ( Coolly . ) It 's all right ; do n't get excited . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) The bird has flown , but he forgot this when he took the jump . ( Points gun at women . MRS . R. runs R. screaming ; MARY screams and runs L. ) Do n't be alarmed ; I 'm not going to shoot  --  at least not yet . ( Is on landing of stairs as he speaks next lines . ) Now might I ask why I 'm so honored by this midnight visit ? ( Snaps on bracket lights and comes down C. ) p. 43 MARY NORTON ( Goes L. C. to MAGEE . ) I can explain in a very few words . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE That will suit me immensely . My time is valuable . I 'm losing thousands of dollars , perhaps , through even this waste of time . ( Looks at MARY intently . ) Be as brief as possible , please , I  --  ( Stares at her . ) MARY NORTON Why do you stare at me so ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Do you believe in love at first sight ? ( MRS . R. takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you mean ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE You know , I 've written about it a great many times , but I never believed in it before . It 's really remarkable !

MARY NORTON Well , to begin with , I  --  ( ' Phone rings . All turn and look at it . ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Goes to ' phone , stops buzzer , then backs upstage C. MRS . R. is R.

( As MARY looks surprised . ) If you please . p. 44 MARY NORTON Certainly . ( Goes to ' phone . MRS . R. goes R. C. above MARY . ) Hello ! What 's that ? Hold the wire , please , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wish to talk to police headquarters ? MRS . RHODES ( Goes to MAGEE C. , frightened . ) Police headquarters ! WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Crossing MRS . R. , who goes over to R. of table L. ) Yes . ( Starts , then stops and looks up at room R. on balcony . ) But , no ; just say they must have made a mistake . ( Backs upstage C. ) MARY NORTON ( In ' phone . ) Hello ! No , no such call put in from here . Must be some mistake . That 's all right . ( Stands up receiver and goes R. MAGEE goes to ' phone , severs connection , then comes down C. MARY up to him . ) Then you did call police headquarters ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE I did . MRS . RHODES ( Goes to C. ) Why did you call police headquarters ? p. 45 MARY NORTON Yes , why did you call police headquarters ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Looks at both , puzzled , then laughs . ) You know , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I get rid of one best seller , than along comes another dyed-in- the-wool " **27;1602;TOOLONG .

WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE But you promised to explain your presence here . MARY NORTON Which I fully intend to do ; but first of all I should like to ask you one question . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Proceed . MARY NORTON How did you get in here without this key ? ( Shows him her key . ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Laughs . ) Oh , no , no ! ( Laughs . ) You know I 'm beginning to think this whole thing is a make-up . MARY NORTON What do you mean ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Points to her key . ) You have the only key to Baldpate in existence , I suppose . p. 46 MARY NORTON So I understood . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Well , if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are more keys to Baldpate that you 'll find in a Steinway piano . MARY NORTON Then he lied . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Who lied ? MRS . RHODES ( Quickly . ) Remember your promise , Mary . ( Crosses to chair in front of fire and sits . ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Follows MRS . R. with his eyes , making complete turn . ) Well ? MARY NORTON I ca n't tell you his name . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Well , at least tell me your name . MARY NORTON My name is Mary Norton . I do special stories for the " Reuton Star . " WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Surprised . ) In the newspaper game ? MARY NORTON That 's it . And this lady  --  ( Pointing to MRS . R. , who is now removing her rubbers. ) is Mrs. Rhodes , with whom I live in Reuton , and who is the only other person who knows I 'm here to do this story . p. 47 WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE What story ? MARY NORTON The story of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would write a complete novel inside of twenty-four hours . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Who told you this ? MRS . RHODES Remember your promise , Mary . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Crosses to R. C. MARY goes L. C. MAGEE looks at MRS . R. and then at MARY . ) You 've made many a promise , have n't you , Mary ? I should certainly like to know who gave you this information . MARY NORTON ( Goes to MAGEE R. C. ) I can tell you only that when the wager was made at the 44th street club this afternoon , a certain someone dispatched the news to me at once . Believing that I had the only key to Baldpate , I hurried here to let you in , and lo and behold  --  ( Takes stage L. , MAGEE following her . ) I find you already at work , and as snug and cozy as you would be in a New York apartment . ( Comes down R. of table , MAGEE following her . ) Now that you know my story , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to allow me to stay here and get the beat . I promise you we shall not disturb you in the least . Have you any objections ? p. 48 WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE And you wo n't tell me who gave you the story ? MARY NORTON I ca n't . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Nor where you got the key ? MRS . RHODES Remember your promise , Mary . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Turns and looks at MRS . R. and then at MARY . ) You know , I wish you had n't brought her with you . MRS . RHODES What ! ( Gets up and starts L. toward MAGEE . ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Goes toward her as she starts up . ) No offense , Mrs. Rhodes . Of course I understand that Mary is a very promising young woman , but why continually remind her of the fact . ( Laughs apologetically . ) That 's just my little joke . Excuse me . ( Goes to MARY C. MRS . R. goes to window , looking out . ) Let me get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write the story of my twenty four hour task ? MARY NORTON With your permission . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Well , I 'll tell you . Had you put such a proposition up to me  --  ( MRS . R. comes downstage to R. C. ) half an hour ago , I should have said emphatically , no ; but since my little experience with the gun-flourishing , window-jumping gentleman , I 'm inclined to entertain the idea of a companion or two . p. 49 MRS . RHODES ( R. of MAGEE . ) Who was the man with the gun ? MARY NORTON Why did he jump from the window ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE You might as well ask me why he placed a package of money in that safe . ( MARY and MRS . R. go up toward safe . ) Or why he telephoned the fact to someone else , who was to pass the word along to Mayor Cargan . MRS . RHODES ( Turns to MAGEE , amazed . ) Mayor Cargan ! WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE What seems to be the trouble ? MARY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a widow ; Mayor Cargan a widower . Perhaps you will understand why the name startled her when I tell you that Mrs. Rhodes is to become Mrs. Cargan next Sunday morning . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Oh , indeed ! ( MARY goes up C. , then down again during next speech . MAGEE crosses to MRS . R. ) Well , congratulations , Mrs. Rhodes . And again I say I did not mean to offend . I am not accusing Mayor Cargan of any transaction , dishonest or otherwise . I was merely trying to point out to you ladies that it has been a night of wild occurrences up to now . However , if you care to take the risk , stay here . It wo n't disturb me in the least , and may possible benefit this young lady in her business . ( Goes toward MARY . Looks at his watch and whistles . ) I 've lost half an hour already , and as every minute means money to me right now , I 'll have to work fast to make up for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARY comes down L.

WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE I sincerely trust you 're right , especially for your own sake . ( MRS . R. sits in front of fire . MAGEE goes to MARY and takes her hand . ) I hope the story proves a whale . I wish  --  MARY NORTON What do you wish ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Oh , nothing  --  I was just thinking of Sunday morning . Good-night . MARY NORTON Good-night . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( As he goes up the stairs . ) I 'd gladly offer you ladies my room , but it 's the only one cleaned and heated , and I must have some comfort for this kind of work . ( On balcony R. ) Good-night , ladies . MARY AND MRS . R. Good-night . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Leaning over balcony . ) Mary  --  that 's the sweetest name in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Good-night . p. 51 MARY NORTON Good-night . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( A long look at MARY and then at MRS . R. ) I still wish you had n't brought her with you . Good-night . MARY NORTON Good-night . ( MAGEE exits into room R. on balcony , closing door . ) MRS . RHODES ( Over to MARY , R. C. ) You do n't believe Jim Cargan guilty of any treachery ? Tell me you do n't , Mary . MARY NORTON I do n't know , Mrs. Rhodes . I told you of the Suburban bribe story we got last night , but I certainly hope the name of Cargan is kept clean , for both your sakes . MRS . RHODES I ca n't believe he 's wrong ! I wo n't believe it ! ( Crosses to L. C. ) MARY NORTON ( Following MRS . R. ) But if he is wrong , it 's best you should know it now . The fates may have brought us here to-night to protect you ; who knows ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden in that safe , he said . MARY NORTON Yes , and that dovetails with the Suburban bribe story . ( Both come down stage a trifle . ) I came down here to do a special . I may get two sweeps with the one broom . Would n't that be wonderful ? I 'd be made ! p. 52 MRS . RHODES ( Turns upstage , looks toward door , and sees PETERS . ) Great Heavens , Mary , look ! MARY NORTON What is it ? ( Looks up at door , sees PETERS , screams and runs L. behind banister . MRS . R. screams and runs R. and hides behind chair . MAGEE enters on balcony after second scream . ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Looking down at women . ) What 's wrong down there ? MRS . RHODES A ghost ! WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE What ! MARY NORTON A ghost ! A ghost ! WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Laughing . ) I 'll bet you four dollars that 's the fellow whose wife ran away with a traveling man . ( Starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( They wave MAGEE back . ) Ssh ! ( MAGEE snips out lights . PETERS unlocks the door , enters , locks door , then throws the sheet over his arm and comes downstage looking from MARY to MRS . RHODES , who both come forward a trifle . MAGEE comes to L. of PETERS at C. ) p. 53 WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE I beg your pardon ; but have you any idea just how many keys there are to this flat ? PETERS ( Ignores question . ) What are these women doing here ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE How 's that ? PETERS I do n't like women . ( MRS . R. and MARY scream and run to foot of stairs . ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE It 's all right , ladies , he 's not a regular ghost . I know all about him . He 's in the picture post-card business . PETERS ( Gruffly . ) What ! WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( To PETERS . ) Just a minute , Bosco . ( To ladies . ) If you ladies will kindly step upstairs into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it .

Now do n't do it again , do you hear ? ( To ladies . ) Go right in , ladies . ( They exit into room R. , closing door . MAGEE down to PETERS . ) So you 're the ghost of Baldpate , are you ? p. 54 PETERS How 'd you people get in here ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Laughs . ) You 're not going to pull that " only key in existence " speech on me , are you ? PETERS What ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE You know there are other keys besides yours . PETERS They 're all imitations . Mine 's the real key . The old man gave it to me the day before he died . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE What old man ? PETERS The father of that young scamp who wastes his time around those New York clubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then you 're not particularly fond of the present owner of Baldpate ? PETERS I hate him and all his men friends . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE You do n't like women either , you say . PETERS I despise them . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE How do little girls and boys strike you ? PETERS Bah ! WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Laughs . ) I can understand your wife now  --  anything in preference to you , even a traveling man . p. 55 PETERS Do n't mention my wife 's name , or I 'll  --  ( Raises lantern to strike MAGEE . ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Pulls lantern out of PETERS ' hand . ) Now , see here , old man , if you make any more bluffs at me I 'll take that white sheet away from you and put you right out of the ghost business . Have n't you any better sense than to go about frightening little children this way ? Why do n't you stick to your own line of work ? You 're a hermit by trade , if I 'm rightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and proud of it . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Then why do n't you cut out this ghost stuff and be a regular hermit ? PETERS I play the ghost because I love to see the cowards run . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Oh , they 're all cowards  --  is that it ? PETERS Cowards , yes . ( Laughs gruffly . ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE And you 're a brave man , I suppose . PETERS A cave man is always a brave man . ( PISTOL SHOTS HEARD OUTSIDE , then a woman 's scream . PETERS laughs and dances up to door and peers through . ) Ha , ha , they 're shooting again , they 're shooting again . ( MARY and MRS . R. have come out on balcony at shots. ) p. 56 WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Up to door and peers through . ) What 's that ? MARY NORTON What 's happened ? MRS . RHODES Is someone hurt ? ( Both lean over balcony , looking down . ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Did you hear a woman scream ? MARY NORTON ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) And a pistol shot . PETERS ( Dramatically , as he goes toward door L. slowly . ) A woman in white  --  a woman in white . They shot at her as they shoot at me when I play the ghost . ( Laughs . ) They thought it was the ghost . ( Almost whispers . ) Thought it was the ghost . ( Laughs viciously and exits door L. MYRA THORNHILL appears at door C. and is seen unlocking it . ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Runs to foot of stairs and calls up to women . ) My God , another key ! MARY AND MRS . R. What ! p. 57 WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Ssh ! It 's a woman . ( He waves them back . ) Ssh ! ( MARY and MRS . R. go back into room R. MAGEE crouches behind banister , unseen by MYRA unit he speaks . ) MYRA THORNHILL ( Enters , locks doors , then tiptoes cautiously to dead C. She takes a sweeping glance around room , then goes to fire and warms herself ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one is in the room , she goes to safe and starts working combination , first picking up lantern from desk and holding it in her left hand , while working combination with her right . ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Snapping on bracket lights . ) I thought I 'd give you a little more light so you could work faster . ( MYRA puts lantern on dask and throws up her hands . ) You need n't throw up your hands ; I 'll take a chance on that quick stuff . Come on out here , please . ( Laughs as MYRA comes around desk R. and to C. slowly . ) I did n't think they did that sort of thing outside of melodrama and popular novels , but I see I was wrong , or I should say right , when I wrote it . ( MYRA continues to advance to him slowly . ) Really , you 're the most attractive burglar I 've ever seen . That is , if you are a burglar . Are you ? p. 58 MYRA THORNHILL ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or do you represent the Reuton Suburban people ? ( MARY and MRS . R. enter on balcony and listen . ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE No , I 'm just an ordinary man trying to win a bet ; but up to now the chances have been dead against me . Perhaps you 'd like to tell me who you are . MYRA THORNHILL I will , if you 'll answer me one question . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Laughs . ) Of course , of course . I 'll answer that one before you ask it . A friend of mine gave it to me . Of course you thought you had the only one in existence , but he lied to you . I have a cute little key of my own . Oh , there are keys and keys , but I love my little key best of all . ( Shows her his key , kissing it ) See ? MYRA THORNHILL I ca n't understand it at all . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE You have n't anything on me . And just about two more keys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to New York , and never make another bet as long I live . MYRA THORNHILL ( Up close to him . ) Will you please tell me your name ? p. 59 WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Well , a name does n't mean so much , so you may call me Mr. Jones . And yours ? MYRA THORNHILL My name is  --  ( Hesitates . MARY and MRS . R lean over balcony , listening . ) Listen . ( Brings MAGEE downstage . ) My husband is the president of the Asquewan Reuton Suburban Railway Company . He has agreed to pay a vast amount of money for a certain city franchise ; a franchise that the political crowd at Reuton has no power to grant . They are going to cheat him out of this money and use it for campaign funds to fight the opposition party at the next election . If he sues for his money back , they are going to expose him for entering into an agreement he knows to be nothing short of bribery . The present mayor is at the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start at mention of mayor 's name . ) I ran to my husband to-night and begged him not to enter into this deal . I warned him that he was being cheated . He would n't believe me but I know it 's true . He 's being cheated , and will be charged with bribery besides . That 's why I risked the mountain on a night like this . I must have been followed , for I was shot at as I reached the top of Baldpate . Oh , I do n't know who you are , but you 're a man and you can help me . ( Puts her hands on his shoulders , pleadingly . ) You will help me , wo n't you ? p. 60 WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Interested . ) Yes . What do you want me to do ? MYRA THORNHILL ( Looks at MAGEE for a moment without speaking , then goes up to safe and back to MAGEE . ) In that safe there is a package containing two hundred thousand dollars . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( MARY and MRS . R start downstairs very slowly . ) MYRA THORNHILL ( Following MAGEE up R. ) That 's the amount . It must be there . A man named Bland was to bring it here and deposit it at midnight . Cargan was to follow later , and was to find it here . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Coming down stage . ) Cargan coming here ! MYRA THORNHILL So they 've planned it . I must have that money out of there before he arrives . You 'll help me , wo n't you ? Do n't you understand ? My husband is being cheated , tricked , robbed , probably ruined . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE But I do n't know the combination . MYRA THORNHILL ( Wringing her hands . ) Oh , there must be something we can do . Please , please  --  ( Kneels at his feet , and puts up her hands imploringly . ) For the sake of my children , help me , please ! ( Magee sees women on stairs , and warns MYRA with a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and faces MARY and MRS . R. , then turns abruptly to MAGEE . ) Who are these women ? What are they doing here ? ( She has changed from hysteria to dignified coldness. ) p. 61 WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Oh , of course , pardon me . ( Goes to women at foot of stairs . MYRA crosses to R. ) May I introduce Miss  --  MYRA THORNHILL ( Cuts him off sharply . ) Please do n't ! ( Turns to women . ) Will you pardon me for a moment , ladies ? MARY AND MRS . R. Certainly . ( They step off stairs and remain L. , keeping their eyes fixed on MYRA and MAGEE . MAGEE goes R. to MYRA . ) MYRA THORNHILL ( Aside to MAGEE . ) For God 's sake , do n't tell them who I am . My husband will kill me if he ever learns that I 've been here on such an errand . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Aside . ) I understand ; you may trust me . I sympathize with you very deeply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take that money away from here to-night unless it be yourself . And I 'll get it out of that safe if I have to blow the thing to smithereens . MYRA THORNHILL You give me your word as a gentleman ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Offers his hand ) My word as a gentleman . p. 62 MYRA THORNHILL ( Takes his hand . ) Thank you . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Pulls down his vest and goes up to MARY and MRS . R. ) Ladies , I wish to present a girl schoolmate of mine , Miss Brown , who has become interested enough in my career to find her way to Baldpate to witness my endeavor to break all records as a speedy story-writer . MARY AND MRS . R. Miss Brown . ( Both bow . MYRA returns the bow . ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Takes out his watch and looks at it . ) Up to now I 'm almost an hour behind myself . However , I expect to catch up with myself before the night is over . That is , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keys to the old front door . MARY NORTON ( Goes up to MAGEE C. ) Now , might I have a word with you alone ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE I 'd be delighted . I 'd like to be alone with you forever . MARY NORTON ( To MYRA . ) Will you pardon me for a moment ? MYRA THORNHILL Certainly . p. 63 WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Go right upstairs . Miss Brown , and make yourself quite at home . ( Starts toward stairs with MYRA . ) Oh , Mrs. Rhodes , will you be good enough to show her to the room ? ( Mary crosses C. to R. ) I 'm sure she needs a little drop of something after that bitter cold trip up the mountain . You 'll find a flask on the table . MRS . RHODES ( Starts up the stairs . ) Come right along , Miss . I know where it is ; I 've already tried it . ( Exits room R. ) MYRA THORNHILL ( Following MRS . R. upstairs . ) Well , really , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I  --  ( Stops C. on balcony , looks down and warns MAGEE to silence with finger on her lips . He reassures her , then goes C. ) MRS . RHODES ( Appearing at door . ) Right in here , Miss . MYRA THORNHILL Thanks , awfully . ( Exits into room , followed by MRS . R. , who closes door . ) MARY NORTON ( Goes quickly to MAGEE at C. ) Who did that woman claim to be ? p. 64 WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE That 's a secret I 've promised never to reveal . MARY NORTON But I overheard everything she said . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Then you know . MARY NORTON I know she lied . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE She lied ! MARY NORTON She claimed to be the wife of Thomas Hayden , president of the Suburban Railway . She lied , I tell you . Why , I 've known Mrs. Hayden all my life ; was brought up and went to school with her daughters . Mrs. Hayden is a woman in her fifties . You can see for yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . There 's a mystery here of some kind  --  someone 's playing a desperate game . ( Goes upstage excitedly , looking up at door R. ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Yes , and it 's costing me five thousand dollars . I 'll never get my work done to-night , I can see that right now . ( Looks at watch . MARY comes down C. ) But what do I care ; I 've met you . MARY NORTON You 're going to give this money over to that woman ? ( PETERS enters from L. and hides behind banisters. ) p. 65 WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Not if she lied . MARY NORTON Well , you believe me , do n't you ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Takes her hand . ) Believe you ! Let me tell you something , little girl . I 've written a lot of those Romeo speeches in my novels , though I never really felt this way before , but here goes : The moment you walked through that door to-night and I laid eyes on you , I made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world for me . Why , there 's nothing I would n't do for you . Try me . MARY NORTON Very well , I shall . Get me that package of money out of that safe before Cargan comes to steal it . Help me to reach Reuton without being molested , and I 'll annihilate the graft machine with tomorrow 's edition of the " Star . " With that money to turn over to the proper authorities as proof of the deal , I 'll wipe out the street car trust and the Cargan crowd with one swing of the pen . And just think , I 'll save Mrs. Rhodes from an alliance with a thief . I know Cargan 's crooked , always has been ; but I must prove it before she 'll break off the engagement . Great Scott ! what a story I 'll write ! Think what it will mean to me and to the City of Reuton itself . ( Puts her hands on his shoulders pleadingly . ) You will do this for me , wo n't you ? Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you want me to do ? MARY NORTON Come , we must hurry . Ca n't you think of some way to open that safe ? ( Goes up toward safe , MAGEE following . He comes down C. ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE What are we going to do ? We do n't know the combination , and I have n't any dynamite . But we must have that $200,000 . ( PETERS moves chair , just enough to betray his presence . ) MARY NORTON ( Comes down to MAGEE , frightened , placing her hand on his arm . ) What was that ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Oh , that was nothing . It was just the wind creeping through the cracks , I fancy . ( Aside . ) Go upstairs ; there 's someone hiding in this room . ( Aloud . ) Good-night , Miss Norton . MARY NORTON Good-night . ( She hurries upstairs and exits into room R. ) ( MAGEE looks around room for a moment , reaches over banisters and snaps out lights ; starts whistling , and then goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slams it loudly , and then comes out and sits behind banisters , watching PETERS. ) p. 67 PETERS ( Makes sure no one is in sight , then goes quickly over to safe and starts working combination quietly , but hurriedly , MAGEE watching him from stairs . CARGAN and MAX appear outside , peering through into room . As the safe door flies open , they enter quickly , CARGAN opening the door . MAX enters and goes quickly up C. and covers PETERS with gun . CARGAN closes door and goes quickly to PETERS . ) LOU MAX Get away from that safe . ( PETERS jumps away . ) Put up your hands ! ( PETERS ' hands go up . ) JIM CARGAN ( Recognizes him as he goes toward safe . ) Oh , it 's you , is it ? ( To MAX . ) The ghost came near walking that time for fair . ( To PETERS . ) Come out of there . ( PETERS comes in front of desk . ) How did you know the combination of that safe ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was money in there ? ( No reply from PETERS . ) Get out of here , you vagabond ! ( Throws PETERS toward L. ) What do you mean by breaking into a man 's safe in the middle of the night ? Throw him in the cellar , Max. p. 68 LOU MAX Come on , hurry up . Get out ! ( Throws PETERS L. ) PETERS ( At door L. ) Damn you , Cargan , I hate you ! JIM CARGAN Get out ! ( Goes up and locks door . ) LOU MAX Go on , get out ! ( PETERS exits L. door ; MAX follows him off and returns almost immediately . ) JIM CARGAN ( Goes to safe and gets package of money . MAX enters . ) By gad , we were n't any too soon . ( Goes to table L. ) Another moment , and he 'd have had it sure . It would be good-bye to the hermit if he ever got hold of a roll like this . ( Flips bills in his hands . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all there ? JIM CARGAN I do n't know ; I 'll see . ( MAGEE comes downstairs and goes behind desk while MAX and CARGAN are counting money . ) You seem surprised that I found the money here . LOU MAX What do you mean  --  surprised ? p. 69 JIM CARGAN ( Rises , puts money in his pocket , then comes in front of table . MAX comes forward and stands L. of CARGAN , below table . ) I 'm going to tell you something , Max . I did n't trust you all day , and I did n't trust you to-night . LOU MAX What do you mean  --  you did n't trust me ? JIM CARGAN I 'll be truthful with you . I thought you were going to double cross me . I thought you were going to beat me to the bankroll through this woman Thornhill . LOU MAX Myra Thornhill ? JIM CARGAN Yes , Myra Thornhill . Oh , do n't play dead ; you knew she was around . You 've had secret meetings with her during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've made  --  I 've had you watched . You 've worked with her before . ( As MAX makes a motion of protest . ) You 've told me so . I had my mind made up to kill you , Max , if this money had been gone , and that 's just what I 'm going to do if you ever double cross me , do you understand ? LOU MAX ( In a hangdog tone . ) Yes , I understand . ( MAGEE , who has been crouching between safe and desk , now stands up , takes aim , and fires at L. wall , then rushes over and turns on bracket lights . At the sound of the shot the women come out on balcony , frightened , and stand looking down at men. ) p. 70 JIM CARGAN ( As MAGEE shoots . ) My God , I 'm shot ! ( Reels against table .

RHODES ( On balcony , watching CARGAN . ) Jim Cargan ! JIM CARGAN ( CARGAN and MAX look up and see women on balcony . ) What are you doing here ? ( MRS . R. does n't reply ; but continues staring at him . ) MYRA THORNHILL ( Looking down at MAX . ) Max , Max , are you hurt ? LOU MAX No ; I 'm all right . JIM CARGAN ( Turning slowly to MAX . ) Myra Thornhill , eh ? So you were trying to cross me , you snake ! ( Chokes MAX .

He might want to take a shot at you , and I 'm giving you the necessary protection . Hurry , please . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( MAX takes CARGAN 'S gun and places it on table . ) Now , Mrs. Rhodes , will you kindly ask the street car president 's wife to step back into that room , then lock the door and remove the key ? ( MYRA goes slowly to room R. MRS . R. follows her , locks the door , then comes to C. of balcony . ) Thank you .

R. ) I 'm awfully sorry about this , for your sake , Mrs. Rhodes . p. 72 MARY NORTON ( To MAGEE , R. of him . ) It 's best she should know . ( To MRS . R. , extending her hand . ) Is n't it , dear ? MRS . RHODES ( Going R. C. , after taking MARY 'S hand . ) I suppose so , dear , I suppose so . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Well , come on , little girl , you 've got to work fast .

Are you going to stay here ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Looks up at room R. and L. ) I 'll have to .

( Over to MYRA , C. ) You claim what ? MYRA THORNHILL Go on , holler your head off , grandpa . ( As she strolls languidly over R. to fireplace . ) It 's music to my ears to hear an old guy squawk . ( Sits in chair in front of fire . HAYDEN goes to BLAND , L. C. ) p. 80 JOHN BLAND ( Waves HAYDEN away . HAYDEN goes upstage . BLAND crosses to MAGEE , R. C. ) What are you going to do with that money ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Goes up around BLAND and up R. C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money . ( All turn and look at him in amazement . ) It 's on its way to Reuton . Miss Norton will see that it is placed in safe and proper hands directly she arrives at the office of the " Reuton Daily Star . " JIM CARGAN The " Daily Star ! " We 're gone ! ( To MAGEE . ) Where did Mrs. Rhodes go ! WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Out of your life forever , Cargan ; she 's got your number . ( Cargan lowers his head without speaking . ) ( Pause , then MAGEE gets chair for BLAND and places it R. C. ) Sit down there . ( BLAND pays no attention . ) Did you hear me ? Sit ! ( BLAND sits slowly and sulkily . ) Sit down , Hermy . Come on , that 's a nice ghost , go on . ( PETERS sits above table . MAGEE places chair for HAYDEN . ) Sit down , Hayden . p. 81 THOMAS HAYDEN I do n't care to sit down , sir . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAYDEN Confound it , sir , do you know that I 'm the president of the Reuton-Asquewan Railway Company ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE I would n't care if you were president of the National League . Sit down ! ( HAYDEN sits , indignant . MAGEE sits in chair , front of switch-board , facing all and covering them with gun . ) Now we 're all going to stay right here till that ' phone bell rings and I get word that Miss Norton is safe and sound in Reuton . That may mean three hours or it may mean six hours ; but we 're all going to stay right here together , no matter how long it takes ; so get comfortable and sit as easy as you can . ( All move uneasily . ) JIM CARGAN ( To MAX , after a pause . ) So you tried to cross me , eh ? The chances are I 'll kill you for this . JOHN BLAND ( After a pause , looking at HAYDEN . ) I 'm afraid I made a mistake in bringing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight pause . ) You 're always making mistakes , you damned blockheaded fool ! p. 82 LOU MAX ( After a pause . ) I 'm sorry I got you into this , Myra . ( No reply from her . ) Oh , Myra , I say I 'm sorry I got you into this . MYRA THORNHILL ( Turns and looks at MAX . ) Oh , go to hell ! PETERS ( After a slight pause . ) I hope to God you 're all sent to prison for life ! WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( After a pause . ) This is going to be a nice , pleasant little party ; I can see that right now . ( After three counts , ring curtain. ) @x The curtain rises on the same situation . After curtain is up , there is silence for about six seconds , then the clock is heard striking TWO . HAYDEN takes out his watch and looks at it . ALL SQUIRM and look at each other impatiently . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Two o'clock . We 've been sitting here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd better put another log on the fire . ( PETERS crosses to fireplace , puts a log on the fire , looks closely at MYRA in front of fireplace , then goes back to former position and sits . ) I think someone ought to say something . Come on , let 's start a conversation . Things are getting awfully dull . THOMAS HAYDEN ( Gets up after a short pause and goes toward MAGEE . ) This is all damned nonsense ! I refuse to stay here another minute . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Coolly , and without moving . ) Sit down , Hayden . I 'm very sorry to inconvenience you in this way , but it 's necessary that you should stay here and keep us company ; so sit down before I shoot you down ; that 's a good little president . ( HAYDEN sits sulkily . ) That 's it . Now , let me see , what can we talk about to kill the monotony and keep things sort of lively ? I have it ! Let 's all tell each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All move uneasily . ) What do you think of the idea ? ( No reply . ) No ? Well , I 'll start the ball rolling , then perhaps we 'll all ' fess up . I brought a letter from the man who owns the inn to the caretaker , giving him instructions to turn the key over to me . That 's how I got mine . Next ? ( Pause . No one speaks . ) No ? Big secrets , eh ? ( Laughs . ) By George ! that 's funny . Let 's see , how many keys are there ? I had the first , Bland the second , Miss Norton the third , our friend the ghost the fourth , this young lady had the fifth , and if I 'm not mistaken , you had the sixth key , Mr. Cargan . Hayden does n't count  --  he had Bland 's key . Six keys to Baldpate so far . I wonder if there are any more . p. 84 PETERS ( After a pause . ) There are seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PETERS in surprise . ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Seven ! How do you know ? PETERS The old man told me the day before he died . Mine 's the original  --  all the others are imitations . ( All turn from him in disgust . ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Seven keys , eh ? More company expected . More melodrama , I suppose . Where did you get your key , Bland ? BLAND AND MAGEE ( Together . ) None of your damned business ! WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Laughs . ) I knew you were going to say that . How about you , Mr. Cargan ? Perhaps you 'll be good enough to throw some light on the key subject . Where did you get yours ? JIM CARGAN I would n't tell you if my life was at stake . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Well , perhaps the young lady will be good enough to inform me where her key came from . ( All turn and look at MYRA . ) MYRA THORNHILL ( Turns and faces men . ) I 've no objections . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! MYRA THORNHILL ( Pointing to MAX . ) He gave the key to me . ( All turn and look at MAX . ) JIM CARGAN ( To MAX . ) Where did you get a key to Baldpate ? LOU MAX I ca n't tell you , Mr. Mayor ; I 've sworn never to tell . JIM CARGAN ( To MYRA . ) I suppose he also gave you the combination to the safe . MYRA THORNHILL He did . LOU MAX ( Pleadingly . ) Myra ! MYRA THORNHILL Oh , shut up ! You never were anything but a cry baby . You 've got me into a pretty mess . Do you think I 'm going to sit here like a fool and not pay you back when I 've got the chance to do it ? ( Gets up and faces men . They all stare at her . ) I 'll tell you the whole scheme . I was to come here and make off with the package , and Cargan was to follow and find it gone . We were to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turns on MAX . ) You rat ! ( MAX turns from CARGAN in hangdog fashion. ) p. 86 MYRA THORNHILL His excuse to Cargan for the disappearance of the money was going to be to accuse BLAND of never having put it there . ( Points to BLAND at mention of his name . ) JOHN BLAND What ! ( Starts toward L. ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Sit down , Bland . ( BLAND hesitates , then sits . ) JOHN BLAND ( Turning to HAYDEN . ) Do you hear that , Guv'nor ? He was going to accuse me of stealing the money . JIM CARGAN ( To MAX . ) You mark my words , I 'm going to kill you for this . JOHN BLAND ( To CARGAN . ) Where did you get a key to Baldpate , Cargan ? You told me you could n't get in here unless I met you and unlocked the door . ( Cargan looks embarrassed , but does not reply . ) MYRA THORNHILL I can explain that . ( All look toward her . ) He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Am I right ? JOHN BLAND That 's right ; I made the appointment over the ' phone . p. 87 MYRA THORNHILL Well , the plan was to steal in here in the dead of night and take the money . He fully intended to keep his appointment here to-morrow morning , however , and appear just as much surprised as you would have been when you discovered the safe empty and the package gone . In other words , he was going to cross not only you , but Hayden and everyone else connected with the bribe . He tried to cross you  --  ( Points to BLAND. ) and Lou Max tried to double cross him . ( Points to CARGAN . Laughs and sits . ) If I had n't been interrupted by our friend here  --  ( Nods her head in MAGEE 'S direction . ) I 'd have gotten the money and triple crossed the whole outfit . BLAND AND HAYDEN What ! MYRA THORNHILL Yes , that was my intention . Scruples are a joke when one is dealing with crooks ? JIM CARGAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Sit down , Cargan . JIM CARGAN ( Infuriated . ) Do you think I 'll stand to be  --  WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Sternly . ) Sit down , I tell you . I 'm the school teacher here . Be a good little mayor and sit down . ( CARGAN sits. ) p. 88 MYRA THORNHILL ( Sneeringly , after a sight pause . ) Why , you 're not even clever crooks . You trusted Max , and Max trusted me . ( Laughs . ) A fine chance either one of you had if ever I had gotten hold of that money . THOMAS HAYDEN ( To BLAND , after thinking a moment . ) Who is this woman ? JOHN BLAND I do n't know . JIM CARGAN ( Turns to HAYDEN . ) Her name is Thornhill . Do n't believe a word she says . Hayden ; her oath is n't worth a nickel . She 's a professional blackmailer , pure and simple . THOMAS HAYDEN ( To MYRA . ) Is this true ? MYRA THORNHILL I never heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Laughs . ) So far as my word is concerned , I fancy it will carry as much weight as the word of a crooked politician or the word of his man " Friday , " whom he knows to be an ex-convict . LOU MAX ( Starts up . ) What ! WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Sit down , Maxy , it 's just getting good . ( MAX slinks into his chair. ) p. 89 THOMAS HAYDEN ( To BLAND , who looks at him . ) Fine people you 've introduced me to , you lunk-headed idiot ! JOHN BLAND Well , what are you blaming me for ? You wanted the deal put through , did n't you ? After this you can do your own crooked work . I 'm not anxious to get mixed up in a thing of this kind . You 've got a fine nerve to go after me . THOMAS HAYDEN ( Gets up . ) How dare you talk to your employer in such a manner ! JOHN BLAND Oh , sit down ! ( HAYDEN sits . ) What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you to stay out of the deal  --  that it was wrong . You know well enough that it 's only cheating the city of Reuton out of its rights . If this thing ever comes to light , we 're all lucky if we do n't spend five or six years in a stone yard . I tell you right now , if it comes to a show-down , I 'm going to make a clean breast of the whole affair . I do n't care who I send away , so long as I can save myself . You need n't think you can get me in a fix like this and have me keep my mouth shut . No , sir ; I 'm going to tell the truth , and I do n't care a damn who suffers , so long as I get away . MYRA THORNHILL ( Laughs . ) One of our best little squealers. p. 90 JOHN BLAND ( To MYRA . ) Well , you squealed , did n't you ? MYRA THORNHILL Sure , I 'm with you , Cutey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the place . ( All show alarm . ) JIM CARGAN ( To MAX , after a pause . ) So you tried to cross me , eh ? LOU MAX Certainly I tried to cross you . Why should n't I ? You 're around crossing everybody , ai n't you ? ( Rises . ) I 've stood for your loud talk long enough , Cargan . I 've been wanting to call you for the last two years . You 're a great big bluff , that 's all you are , and I 'm going to get even for that punch you took at me , do you hear ? Now you shoot any more of that killing stuff at me , and I 'll go after you like a wild bear . You 're never going to kill anybody , you have n't got the nerve ; but I have , and the next bluff you make at me will be your last . ( Sits . ) It 's you fault I 'm mixed up in this affair , and the best thing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you understand ? ( Smashes table with fist . Pause , then looks at HAYDEN . ) You did n't think you were going to get that franchise for two hundred thousand , did you , Hayden ? Why , this man would have bled you for half a million before the bill went through , and then held you up for hush money besides . I know what I 'm talking about . He was going to rob you , Hayden , and I dare him to call me a liar . ( All look at CARGAN , who swallows the insult in fear of MAX 'S attitude. ) p. 91 THOMAS HAYDEN ( After a pause . ) Cargan , is it true that you were going to rob me of this money ? JIM CARGAN ( Turns to HAYDEN after a slight pause . ) Well , if you want to know  --  yes , that 's what I was going to do , rob you ; just what you deserve . You were trying to rob the city , were n't you ? You 're just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crook , it 's your kind that has made me so  --  you , with your rotten money tempting men to lie and steal . ( Settles back in his chair . ) Big corporations such as your 's are the cause of corrupt politics in this country , and you 're just the kind of a sneak that helps build prisons that are filled with the poor devils that do your dirty work . You 're worse than a crook  --  you 're a maker of crooks . ( Turns to HAYDEN , leans forward and points at him . ) But I promise you , Hayden , that if I go up for this , you 'll go with me . It 's your fault that I entered into this thing , and , by Gad ! I 'll get even if I have to lie over a Bible and swear your life away . ( Turns , facing audience . ) Rob you ! Humph ! You 've got a hell of a gall to yell about being robbed , you have ! PETERS ( After slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're all burned to a crisp ! p. 92 WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Laughs . ) You know my suggestion was to start a conversation , not a rough house . THOMAS HAYDEN ( After a slight pause . ) This woman who took the money  --  who is she ? MYRA THORNHILL A newspaper reporter . JOHN BLAND On the " Daily Star . " JIM CARGAN The sheet that has fought me ever since I 've been in office . They 've got me this time , sure . LOU MAX ( After a pause , looking nervously at MAGEE . ) How much longer are you going to keep us here ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE That 's for the telephone to say . I 'll release you as soon as I 'm sure Miss Norton is safe and sound in Reuton . ( All turn toward MAGEE , surprised . ) JOHN BLAND Then you 're not going to turn us over to the police ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Certainly not . Why should I ? ( Movement of relief from all . ) PETERS ( Gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( All turn toward PETERS . ) Oh , how I 'd love to be on the jury ! p. 93 WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Sit down , Hermy , I need a little target practise . And remember , there 's no law against killing ghosts . ( PETERS sits . ) THOMAS HAYDEN There 's no train to Reuton till five o'clock . That means we must stay here till six , eh ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE I 'm afraid so , unless they make it by automobile from Asquewan . It means several hours at the best , so you might as well be patient ; you 've got a long wait . ( All move uneasily . ) MYRA THORNHILL ( Cuddling up in her chair . ) Me for my beauty sleep . Good-night . ( Short pause , then phone rings . All start and stare at it . MAGEE gets up and stops buzzer . ) LOU MAX She could n't have made it as quick as that . It 's over an hour by automobile . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Keeps them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please , Miss Thornhill . ( MYRA gets up and goes to ' phone . MAGEE backs upstage . ) I 'm going to keep looking straight ahead of me to-night . Hurry , please . Give me the message as you get it . I 'll tell you what to say if it requires an answer . p. 94 MYRA THORNHILL ( At ' phone , in a bored tone . ) Hello ! Yes , Baldpate Inn . Yes , I know who you mean . Just a moment . ( To MAGEE . ) Someone wants to talk to you . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Get the name . MYRA THORNHILL ( In ' phone . ) Hello ! who is this , please ? Oh , yes . Very well , I 'll tell him . ( Turns to MAGEE . ) Miss Norton . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Say that it is impossible for me to turn my back long enough to come to the ' phone , and that you will take the message and repeat it to me as you get it . MYRA THORNHILL ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is impossible for him to turn his back long enough to come to the ' phone . You are to give me the message , and I am to repeat it to him as I get it . You 're talking from the Commercial House in Asquewan . You missed the package of money five minutes ago . ( All turn . ) You either dropped it in the inn before you left , or else lost it while hurrying down the mountain . Search the inn thoroughly . ( Pause , while all look around room . ) Ask him whether or not you should notify the police . ( All show fear . ) You 're nearly crazy , and do n't know which way to turn . Just a moment . ( Turns and looks at MAGEE . ) Well , what shall I say ? p. 95 WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Looks around at all , then answers , after a pause . ) Say to hold the wire . MYRA THORNHILL ( In ' phone . ) Hold the wire , please . ( Gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money lost ! JIM CARGAN Thank God , there goes their evidence ! LOU MAX Who ever heard of losing two hundred thousand dollars ! JOHN BLAND Ca n't be done outside of Wall Street . Surest thing you know , she 's holding out . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Smiles . ) You 're a quick thinker , Miss Thornhill . MYRA THORNHILL ( Turns to MAGEE . ) What do you mean ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE That I do n't believe you got that message at all . MYRA THORNHILL ( Shrugs her shoulders indifferently . ) Very well ; she 's on the wire  --  see for yourself . ( Sits in chair in front of fire . ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Come here , Hermy. p. 96 PETERS My name 's not Hermy ; my name 's Peters . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Well , whatever it is , come here . ( PETERS goes up to MAGEE , up R. ) I know you do n't like anybody in this room any better than I do , so I 'm going to take a chance on you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get this message , and you kill the first man or woman that makes a move , do you undersand ? PETERS ( Vindictively . ) I 'd like to kill them all . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Do n't shoot unless you have to . ( He hands PETERS the gun and goes to ' phone . ) Hello ! PETERS Damn you , Cargan , I 've got you at last ! ( Goes toward CARGAN and is grabbed by HAYDEN . MYRA screams and jumps up . BLAND springs on MAGEE and struggles with him . MAX rushes over to R. , and the two overpower MAGEE at ' phone . When HAYDEN grabs PETERS , CARGAN rushes over and struggles with PETERS , wrestling gun from him . ) LOU MAX ( To MAGEE . ) Take it easy , young fellow ; you have n't got a chance . p. 97 JOHN BLAND We 've got him ! JIM CARGAN ( After wrenching gun from PETERS , he hits him a blow , knocking him down . ) What do you think of that ! ( BLAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms . PETERS is on the floor C. , CARGAN standing over him , with gun . HAYDEN is L. , looking on . CARGAN to PETERS : ) So you wanted to take a shot at me , eh ? ( Kicks PETERS . ) Get up ! ( PETERS gets up in fear . CARGAN backs upstage slightly . ) Put them both up in the room where he put us , and lock the door . JOHN BLAND They can make a getaway from the window , CARGAN ; I did it myself . JIM CARGAN There 's no window in that room ; it 's a linen closet . Put them up there . ( He backs upstage , gun in hand . PETERS starts upstairs . ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( To CARGAN , as he comes to C. on way to stairs . ) What 's the idea , Cargan ? JIM CARGAN ( Backing up C. and pointing gun . ) Go on , I 'm the school teacher now  --  do as you 're told . ( HAYDEN goes to extreme L. as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BLAND goes R. below ' phone . CARGAN speaks next lines to MYRA with his back to her . ) Get on that ' phone , Miss Thornhill , and tell that woman not to notify the police . Say that she is to return here at once , and see what she says . ( MYRA goes to ' phone . MAGEE and MAX are now on landing . PETERS is standing at door of room L. on balcony ) p. 98 MYRA THORNHILL ( In ' phone . ) Hello ! Yes . Why , the message is that you are not to notify the police of the loss . Say nothing to anyone , but return here at once . That is the message . Yes , good-bye . ( Hangs up receiver . ) JIM CARGAN ( To MYRA , still watching MAGEE . ) All right . MYRA THORNHILL ( Rising from switchboard . ) As quick as she can get here , she says . ( Goes down R. to chair . ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Stops on landing as he hears ' phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cargan ? JIM CARGAN Never mind ; I 'm running things now . Get in there ! ( PETERS exits into room L. on balcony . ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE You harm that girl , and I 'll get you if it 's the last act of my life . JIM CARGAN I 've read that kind of talk in books . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE I write books of that kind , but I 'm talking real talk now . LOU MAX ( To MAGEE . ) Go on , get in there . ( MAGEE goes upstairs and exits into room L. MAX locks door and comes to foot of stairs . BLAND has gone L. CARGAN puts gun in his pocket and comes down C. ) p. 99 THOMAS HAYDEN ( Over to CARGAN at C. ) Now what 's the move , Cargan ? JIM CARGAN We 're going to get that money if she 's got it on her . JOHN BLAND You do n't think she 's fool enough to bring it back with her if she 's trying to get away with it , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it if you find it on her , Cargan ? JIM CARGAN Keep it , of course . THOMAS HAYDEN It 's my money . JIM CARGAN Our agreement holds good . You people will get the franchise , do n't worry . THOMAS HAYDEN Why , you 've just openly declared that you were going to rob me of the money . JIM CARGAN Oh , because I was mad clean through . Was n't I being accused right and left ? I did n't mean a word I said , Hayden . I do n't even know now what I said . ( Pats HAYDEN ingratiatingly on the shoulders , then goes up C. , looking up at room L. ) THOMAS HAYDEN ( Goes to BLAND , who is below table L. ) What do you think , Bland ? ( CARGAN and MAX come downstage to C. ) p. 100 JOHN BLAND Do n't ask me ; you bawled me out once to-night , that 's enough . JIM CARGAN I have n't forgotten what you said to me , Mr. Max . LOU MAX I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to remember it all your ( As CARGAN reaches for gun . ) I would n't care if you had six guns on you .

MAX crosses to MYRA , R. ) So you tried to double cross me , eh ? MYRA THORNHILL ( Turns and faces MAX . ) Why certainly . Who are you ? LOU MAX Why damn you , I  --  ( Raises his hand to strike MYRA , who shrinks away . ) JOHN BLAND ( Crossing quickly to C. ) Here , wait a minute , Max ; nothing like that while I 'm around . LOU MAX ( Turns to BLAND . ) Maybe you want some of it . Why , I  --  ( Raises his hand to strike BLAND. ) p. 101 JOHN BLAND ( Grabs MAX 'S arm and throws it back . ) Now behave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes for me . I want you to cut out this wild talk . I 'm not going to listen to any more of it . I 'll put you on your back if you make another bluff at me . THOMAS HAYDEN ( Goes toward MAX and BLAND , C. ) Gentlemen , gentlemen , please ! ( MAX and BLAND look each other in the eye for a moment , then MAX goes up R. near safe . ) JOHN BLAND ( Turns to HAYDEN after MAX has gone up R. ) You keep out of this , Hayden ; you 'll get all you 're looking for if you do n't . ( Raises his hand to HAYDEN as if to strike . ) THOMAS HAYDEN Put it down ! Put it down , do you hear me ! What do you mean by raising your hand to me ? Why , damn me , for two pins I 'd take and wipe up the floor with you . I can whip a whole army of cowards like you . Now get away from me .

You can scare these three little boys , but I do n't want you to annoy me , because I 've got a nasty temper ; so go on , get away before I lose it . ( HAYDEN stares at MYRA , dumbfounded , then goes quickly to L. MYRA seats herself in chair after HAYDEN turns from her .

Just as BLAND and CARGAN get to first landing , MAGEE kicks the door open from the inside , and in the breakaway the lock falls to the floor .

( BLAND and CARGAN enter and stand on balcony C. , listening . ) No ; if it 's murder , there 's the murderer  --  ( Points to MAX , crosses to him R. , then back to L. C. ) self-confessed . But you 're all as guilty as this man  --  every one of you . It 's the outcome and result of rotten politics and greed . I 'll swear to every word that 's been uttered here to-night . I 've had my ear against the crack of that door for the last five minutes . I over-heard every word that passed between you . I 'll tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it , gentlemen , with your suicide alibi . It 's murder in the first degree , and I 'm going to help make you pay the penalty .

Well  --  ( Smiles , goes up C. to R. of CARGAN and looks them all over . ) Come on , somebody open up . What 's the big gathering all about ? LOU MAX ( Pointing to MAGEE . ) He 's got a key ; make him give it up . JIGGS KENNEDY ( To MAGEE . ) Come on . ( MAGEE hands CHIEF his key . ) You got anything more to say ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE I prefer to tell my story in the presence of witnesses . I insist upon the immediate arrest of everyone here , myself included . THOMAS HAYDEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madman . JIGGS KENNEDY Well , somebody telephoned police headquarters from here about two hours ago , and when we got on the wire Central said they 'd hung up . We got a new connection , and asked if they 'd called , and some woman said , " no , it was a mistake . " We got to thinking it over at headquarters , and it did n't listen good , so we looked it up and found out that the call had been put in from Baldpate Inn ; so I made up my mind to come here and investigate . Now , when I started up the mountain ten minutes ago the lights were on full blast , and all of a sudden they went out , and there was a pistol shot , too . Every one of my men heard the report , and we all agree it came from this direction . Now , what 's it all about ? p. 115 WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ' T was I who called up police headquarters .

WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE I do n't intend to tell my story until I 'm under oath . I want every word I say to go on the court records . I charge these men with conspiracy and murder . JIGGS KENNEDY What is this , Cargan ? JIM CARGAN The poor devil 's gone mad , I guess . He shot and killed a woman a few minutes ago , and he 's accused every man here of the crime . JIGGS KENNEDY Murder , eh ? THOMAS HAYDEN Yes , cold blooded murder . JIGGS KENNEDY ( To MAGEE . ) Who was the woman you shot ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Do n't let these men get away with this , Chief . I can prove my innocence . ( Pointing to MAX . ) There 's the real murderer . These men know it as well as I do . They 're accusing me in an attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the truth because this man is a squealer , and they know that a confession from him of a scheme to steal the right of way for a street car franchise in Reuton will send them all to the State penitentiary . I can prove why I 'm here to-night ; ask these men their reason for being here , and let 's hear what they have to say . ( KENNEDY looks from one to the other without speaking. ) p. 116 JIM CARGAN He 's been raving like that for the last ten minutes , Chief . JIGGS KENNEDY ( To MAGEE . ) What is your reason for being here ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE I came here to write a book . JIGGS KENNEDY ( To CARGAN . ) You 're right , he 's a lunatic , sure .

He wo n't be here till seven or eight o'clock . You people will have to stay here till he comes . ( CARGAN , BLAND and HAYDEN sit near table L. MAX sits R. ) What room is she in ?

All look back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To MAGEE , when he gets on balcony . ) Take my tip and do n't try to get away , young fellow . One of those cops outside will blow your head off if you do . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Goes L. near foot of stairs as men go up . ) You need n't be afraid . I 'm going to stay right here , and I 'm going to make sure these other men do until we 're all taken into custody . THOMAS HAYDEN It 's a sad case , Chief . JIGGS KENNEDY We 're used to that . They generally go out of their minds after they shoot . Where is she ? JIM CARGAN ( Goes to door of room R. ) In here , Chief .

( Comes down to C. and looks them all over . ) THOMAS HAYDEN I ca n't understand it at all . JIM CARGAN She was in that room ten minutes ago , Chief . JOHN BLAND I 'll take a solemn oath on that . LOU MAX My God , I 'm going insane ! ( Grabs chair to steady himself . ) JIGGS KENNEDY Say , what the devil is this all about ?

WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE In the cellar . BLAND , CARGAN , HAYDEN AND MAX What ! JIGGS KENNEDY In the cellar ! WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE If I 'm not mistaken , that 's where she was taken after the murder . THOMAS HAYDEN You lie ! JIM CARGAN You know she was taken to that room . ( Points to room R. on balcony . ) JOHN BLAND You saw us carry her there . LOU MAX Of course he did . JIGGS KENNEDY ( To MAGEE . ) What are you trying to do , trap me in the cellar ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE I tell you , Chief , you 'll find the victim in the cellar . Then you can judge for yourself if I 'm as crazy as these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly gone mad themselves . JIGGS KENNEDY ( Blows his whistle . ) I 'll get at the bottom of this thing pretty quick . ( Rushes up to door , unlocks and opens it . Two Cops enter , come to L. of stage up C. and await orders . KENNEDY locks door and goes to Cops . ) Search the cellar of this place , and report to me here what you find  --  every nook and corner . And do n't leave a thing unturned , understand ? ( Cops salute . MARY APPEARS OUTSIDE DOOR . ) Hurry up then . ( Cops exit through door L. KENNEDY comes down C. ) If this thing is a practical joke , you 'll all land in jail for it . I 'm not going to be made the laughing stock of Asquewan Falls , I 'll tell you that right now . ( MARY , who has been peering through door , opens it during this speech and enters . KENNEDY turns as door opens and goes upstage . ) Hello ! , who 's this ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Miss Norton ! ( MARY locks door and starts down L. C. ) JIGGS KENNEDY ( To MARY . ) I 'll take that key , please . MARY NORTON ( Hands CHIEF the key and goes to MAGEE L. C. ) Why are the police here ? ( KENNEDY goes down R.

LOU MAX She 's a thief ; she stole a package of money . JIGGS KENNEDY Whose money ? THOMAS HAYDEN My money . JIM CARGAN ( L. , in front of table . ) No , my money . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE It 's bribe money , Chief . JIGGS KENNEDY Where is the money ? p. 122 MARY NORTON ( Turns and faces CHIEF . ) The money 's been lost . BLAND , HAYDEN , MAX AND CARGAN What ! JIGGS KENNEDY Say , what the hell are you people trying to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARY . ) Where did you lose it ? MARY NORTON ( To MAGEE . KENNEDY goes over , listening . ) I do n't know  --  somewhere between here and Asquewan . I searched every inch of the way from the bottom of the mountain to the top . It 's gone , I 'm afraid . WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Where is Mrs. Rhodes ? MARY NORTON She became too hysterical to return . I left her at the Commercial House in Asquewan . JIGGS KENNEDY How much money was it ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Two hundred thousand dollars . JIGGS KENNEDY ( Looks from one to the other . ) Come on , cut out the kidding stuff  --  how much was it ?

My brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tugs at his collar , breathing hard . ) JIGGS KENNEDY ( Comes to C. and looks them all over . ) Huh ! Hayden gave the money to Bland ; Bland put the money in the safe ; Peters opened the safe ; Cargan took the money from Peters ; this fellow took the money from Cargan and gave it to the newspaper reporter ; she loses the money in the mountains ; then somebody killed a woman and the corpse got up and walked away ,  --  and you expect me to believe this bunk , do you ? MARY NORTON ( To MAGEE . ) What does he mean by saying that somebody killed a woman ? WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE Do n't worry , it 's all right .

As they pass in front of MARY , she backs up against windows and stands with arms outstretched against them . PETERS is standing R. , laughing . ) WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Goes over R. to PETERS quickly . ) What did you do , bring her back to that room ? PETERS Is n't that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , you blithering idiot ! ( Turns and takes MARY in his arms as she runs to him . ) MARY NORTON Tell me who did this ? How did it happen ? p. 128 WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE It 's all right ; take it easy . ( MAX , BLAND , CARGAN and HAYDEN enter from room R. in this rotation , all wild-eyed . They line up on balcony and keep their eyes glued to door of room . KENNEDY enters on balcony , also keeping his eyes fixed on room . He looks at men on balcony and then down at MAGEE and MARY , who stare up at him ; then at PETERS , who is over R. ) JIGGS KENNEDY Say , what are you people trying to do to me ?

Is there a woman there by the name of Rhodes ? She was . She did , eh ? How long ago ? I see . What 's that ? She asked you to mind a package for her till she got back ? ( All look at each other , startled . ) Where have you got it ? In the safe ? Say , listen , Charlie ; call headquarters right away and get a man over there .

( Hangs up receiver and comes to C. All come forward . ) She left the hotel a quarter of an hour ago . She put the package in the hotel safe before she went . ( He looks them all over . They stand staring at each other . ) Humph ! Somebody kills a woman  --  the victim disappears and then comes back  --  that 's pretty good stuff . p. 129 WILLIAM HALLOWELL MAGEE ( Aside to MARY , R.
