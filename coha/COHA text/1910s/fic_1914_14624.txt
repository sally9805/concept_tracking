General living-room at the DAWSONS ' . After dinner , an evening a few days before Christmas . The architecture of the room , with some modern innovations , suggests the period of 1860 . Two long French windows at the right , now heavily curtained , are supposed to open on a porch , beyond which the lake and the Capitol might be seen . In the center a large doorway , with topping , opens on the wide hallway which serves as a general entrance ; the stairs are seen beyond this . There is a comfortable fireplace with a marble mantel covered by a heavy lambrequin at the left just beyond the door which , when opened , discloses a small back stairway to the floor above . A small " Rogers " terra-cotta statuette of a man and woman  --  properly clothed  --  is by the window . Near this is a large covered table , with trade magazines and a lighted lamp : a sofa at its right and a chair at the left . There is also a large grandfather chair  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain some steel engravings and a family portrait of DAWSON 'S father , hung by thick red rope-cord and fastened to white knobs , after the fashion of an earlier generation . Upon the mantel is a glass-incased gilt clock . A large chandelier in the center of the room , hung fairly high , is strangely innovated with electric lights . Some similar light brackets are on the walls . In the right upper corner is a heavy desk with large drawers . The electric switch is near this . Other furnishings , a foot-stool , etc. , must add to the stability and comfort of a room long lived in . There is a log fire burning with logs on the side . Strong winter moonlight flows through the curtains , when they are pulled aside . The hallway without is also lighted . DAWSON , MRS . DAWSON , and SAM are discovered . DAWSON is reading the headlines of " The Times , " the town newspaper , between puffs of his pipe . MRS . DAWSON is seated near him , sewing . SAM is stretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking a cigarette . DAWSON , a well-preserved , domineering though not unkindly man , is about sixty . His obvious prosperity , achieved through hard application , adds authority to his well-defined opinions . He lacks the conscious external refinements of his wife but possesses the force and character which have won the respect if not the love of the town , where he is ranked as one of the " best people . " MRS . DAWSON is a woman of tenderness , capacity , and understanding , who has become somewhat quiet and repressed under her husband 's attitude toward their family life . She is about fifty , charming and reposeful in manner at first , though suggesting a quiet power which , when exerted , is gradually to lose its timidity of expression and to become strong and assertive . SAM , their son , is about twenty-six , handsome , well-groomed , and attractive in appearance , though his manner is flippant and not pleasing . He suggests weakness rather than baseness of character . He has followed the line of least resistance until it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinister shade to what would otherwise be mere uselessness . WILLIAM DAWSON Did you ever hear such rot ? " What Eight Million Women Want . " And it is n't in the funny column , either , Belle . ( Reading ) " Eight Million Women Supporting Themselves  --   --  " Bosh ! Exaggeration . You ca n't believe anything you see in the paper these days . Nothing but women and politics . What 's come over " The Times " anyway ? ( Turning to front page ) " Woman 's Suffrage Edition . " Bah ! One of Peter Row 's brilliant suggestions , I suppose . " Why Should Servants Work All Day ? " Bah ! These bachelors. p. 3 BELLE Will you let me see it , dear , when you 're through ? WILLIAM DAWSON Of course .

She has the fidelity that often earns more responsibility than lenience  --  though she has long since felt herself part of the family , which has naturally given her the right to certain familiarities . ) NELLIE Will I save dinner for Diana any longer ? WILLIAM DAWSON ( Looking at his watch ) No ; daughter ca n't be coming now  --  if she 's coming at all . Just like her not to let us know the train . NELLIE ( Eagerly ) Oh , MRS . Dawson , do you think she 'll come back home ? BELLE One never knows what Diana will do . ( Wistfully ) I hope so . WILLIAM DAWSON Turn this light on , Nellie . I ca n't see . ( She pushes switch near him and he leans over so MRS . DAWSON wo n't hear ) Nellie , burn this newspaper . p. 4 NELLIE I 'll save it and read it myself . ( He takes it back and puts it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a log on the fire . NELLIE All right , Sammy . BELLE ( Displeased ) Nellie 's been working all day . She 's tired . SAM ( Blowing rings of smoke ) So am I , mother . ( NELLIE puts on a log . She gets a footstool also and places it under his feet . ) WILLIAM DAWSON ( To NELLIE ) Did the Christmas wreaths come ? NELLIE Not yet , Mr. Dawson . BELLE Shall I help you with the dishes , Nellie ? NELLIE No , MRS . Dawson . I 've got them scraped and in hot water . ( NELLIE exits . ) BELLE Ca n't the Christmas things wait till to-morrow , Will ? WILLIAM DAWSON ( Positively ) Always have hung them three days before Christmas , always will SAM Mother , I wish you 'd ask Nellie not to call me " Sammy .

( He takes out a long legal envelope and comes down to SAM ) I want a word with you , Sam . Straighten that desk out will you , Belle dear ; that 's a good girl . ( She puts down her sewing and straightens out desk but listens quietly to the following ) This stands for the work of my life and your grand-father 's . SAM ( Sarcastically ) Oh , it 's the plumbing business ? WILLIAM DAWSON Yes . " Dawson 's " ; " General Plumbing Contractor . " It 's kept us all  --  ( Looking at it fondly . ) My work .

SAM I thought you said it was a present . WILLIAM DAWSON Wanted you to have it after you left college , but college did n't seem to agree with you . SAM I figured if you had n't needed a college education to be a success , I did n't . WILLIAM DAWSON I guess you did n't know how disappointed I was . So I 've waited , staked you while I let you have your fling in the city . Boys will be boys . But you have n't set the place on fire . SAM Arson is n't popular now .

DAWSON ) He wo n't take it , Belle . BELLE ( Looking up ) Remember , you always said it was a boy 's place to go out into the world and choose for himself . WILLIAM DAWSON ( With some acceptance ) Well , maybe you 'll see it differently in a year or so . SAM Sure . ( With a sudden thought ) But , meantime , you 'll not dock my allowance for having the courage of my convictions ? WILLIAM DAWSON Oh , do n't fear . I 'll carry you till you get on your feet .

And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , pleased ) Another year . WILLIAM DAWSON But do n't you go making a fool of yourself about any woman . p. 8 SAM ( Startled ) Father , I  --   --  WILLIAM DAWSON I mean getting married or doing worse . SAM ( Nervously ) Why , what would you do ? WILLIAM DAWSON If I 'm paying your bills , do n't try me . That 's all . ( To MRS . DAWSON ) Are other people 's children like ours , Belle ? We did n't act like this to our parents , did we ? ( As he replaces the envelope and locks drawer ) And Diana insisted on leaving home , too . BELLE ( Anxiously ) What time is it , Will ? WILLIAM DAWSON It 's too late for her to be coming back to-night . The last train 's in . ( Re-enter NELLIE , loaded with Christmas wreaths . ) BELLE ( Rising ) Let me have them , Nellie .

WILLIAM DAWSON Tell him to charge it . ( He takes back the money from MRS . DAWSON . ) Where 's the bell ? Did he forget the bell ? NELLIE I 'll see . ( NELLIE exits . ) BELLE ( Examining them ) You bought the same as last year , Will . WILLIAM DAWSON Saves trouble in ordering . Had the wires all put on ready , see ? BELLE ( Sorting them ) I did n't take the hooks down last year . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Surprised ) What ? BELLE ( Humorously ) Saves trouble in hanging them , Will . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Shaking his head ) You 're getting older , dear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places ? ( He nods and she begins to fix them throughout this , getting a chair and standing on it , humoring lines and business . NELLIE re-enters with a Christmas bell and then helps MRS . DAWSON . ) WILLIAM DAWSON That 's fine , Nellie . You hold that chair so she does n't fall . I 'll tell you if it 's the right height . BELLE ( Stretching ) How is this ? WILLIAM DAWSON A little higher . There ! That 's right . Get the other on the same line . SAM ( Aside to DAWSON , with hidden intention ) Father , what 's bringing Diana back all of a sudden ? WILLIAM DAWSON ( Eyeing him ) Has n't your sister told you ? SAM I 've been too busy to see much of her in the city . What 's bringing her , anyway ? WILLIAM DAWSON How should I know ? ( Turning ) That 's right , Belle . SAM She 's not the sort who 'd come unless you wrote her . WILLIAM DAWSON She 'll come if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could a girl do ? p. 11 SAM I 've done everything I could to discourage her foolishness . WILLIAM DAWSON You 've tried to protect her , I know . Look out , do n't fall , Belle . Be more careful , Nellie . ( He lights his pipe as MRS . DAWSON goes to the other window , with NELLIE holding the chair . ) BELLE Hand me another wreath , Will . WILLIAM DAWSON Wait till I light my pipe . ( NELLIE gets it . ) Got a match , Sam ? ( SAM offers him a beautiful gold matchcase ) H 'm , nice case , where did you get it ? SAM Blew myself . ( DAWSON returns case and smokes complacently , sitting with his back to the audience , surveying the women work . ) WILLIAM DAWSON I tell you there 's nothing like a woman 's touch about the house . That 's what makes the home . A little lower , Belle .

NELLIE ( Offering to assist MRS . DAWSON ) Your arms must be tired reaching . p. 12 SAM ( With intention ) Father , is Diana going to stay home now and marry and all that ? WILLIAM DAWSON ( Firmly ) If she comes home she will stay . I told her that when she left against my wishes . ( Anxiously looking at his watch ) Guess she is n't coming , though . She 's a stubborn mule . BELLE ( Getting down ) I thought I heard somebody on the porch . NELLIE ( Eagerly ) Maybe it 's Diana . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Nervously anxious himself ) Nonsense . BELLE ( Quickly ) Maybe she 's walked out . She loves the moonlight so . WILLIAM DAWSON Walk instead of hurrying ? After being away from me two years ? NELLIE ( Gathering things up ) I 'll go see . ( A loud tapping heard . ) That 's her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope so . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Doggedly ) So she has come , eh ? I knew she 'd see she was in the wrong . p. 13 BELLE ( Happily ) Oh , Will , be glad . WILLIAM DAWSON But I told her  --   --  BELLE Do n't talk of that now . ( Goes back . ) Oh , my girl ! Diana ! DIANA DAWSON ( Off ) Nellie ! Nellie ! Mother ! Mother ! WILLIAM DAWSON Mother ! Huh ! Does n't she know I 'm here , too ? ( DIANA enters . ) DIANA DAWSON Mother , mother , mother ! ( She has thrown her hat aside and eagerly embraces her mother with a long kiss . DIANA DAWSONinherits her mother 's sensibilities and her father 's will-power . She is twenty-two or - three , full of vivacity , with abundant humor , which is directed to a definite purpose . Her dominant note is an exhilarating freedom of outlook , which is ever present in all she says and does . She is not beautiful but radiant in manner and appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day older these two years . ( Hugs her again . ) My , but I 'm glad to be with you ! WILLIAM DAWSON ( After standing uncomfortably ) I am here , too . p. 14 DIANA DAWSON Oh , dad ! ( She is constrained a moment ; finally he opens his arms to her , and she hesitates . ) WILLIAM DAWSON Come , Diana . Glad you 're home again . I forgive you . DIANA DAWSON Forgive me ? ( Bursts out laughing . ) Funny as ever , dad . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Taken back ) Funny ? DIANA DAWSON ( Going to him , laughing ) The very first time you spanked me , you should n't have hit my funny bone by mistake . ( They kiss . ) Goodness , you 're getting stouter , daddy . WILLIAM DAWSON Nothing of the sort . DIANA DAWSON ( Seeing SAM ) Well , if there is n't energetic brother Sammy . Wo n't you give me a brotherly kiss to show you have also forgiven your prodigal sister ? SAM ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off coat ) Do n't thank me , I could kiss anybody to-night . WILLIAM DAWSON I hope you won't. p. 15 DIANA DAWSON Then watch over me , you two , with careful eyes ; for I 'm on my toes . It was so glorious under the stars with the moon silvering the lake . ( Looking about the room ) My , my , everything 's just the same . BELLE We have electric lights . WILLIAM DAWSON Your mother 's idea ; hate them myself . DIANA DAWSON ( Seeing statuette ) Oh , and your dear old ugly terra-cotta ! Has it ever been moved in these two years ? WILLIAM DAWSON ( Smiling ) Diana 's not forgotten what a good housekeeper you are , Belle . DIANA DAWSON Everything else the same . ( She gives a comic sigh and adds abruptly ) Has Peter Row come yet , mother ? WILLIAM DAWSON Did you expect to find him here ? DIANA DAWSON Do n't you like him any better ? ( DAWSON grunts . ) ' Phoned him from the station to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow some excuse to intrude on the family 's sacred circle . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Shaking his head ) I have no use for Peter Row . He 's a radical . p. 16 DIANA DAWSON ( Exuberantly ) After my own heart . SAM Hope he does n't get it . Pity you could n't become interested in somebody who has something . DIANA DAWSON I am . He 's got our bags . We took the short cut . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Surprised ) We ? DIANA DAWSON Yes ; Betty ; Betty Howe and I. ( SAM starts violently and catches DIANA 'S quick glance at him . ) BELLE ( Pleased ) You brought Betty Howe with you ? WILLIAM DAWSON ( Displeased ) Here ? DIANA DAWSON Did I forget to write you ? BELLE I 'm so glad . Where is she ? DIANA DAWSON Outside , with Nellie . She would n't come in with me till I 'd seen you all first . Take off my rubbers , Sammy . ( DIANA sits in the grandfather chair , puts her two feet out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reluctantly takes off the rubbers , she says pointedly ) I do n't think she knows you are here , Sam . ( He eyes her. ) p. 17 WILLIAM DAWSON But I just wanted the family all together this Christmas , Belle . You do n't seem to understand the family feeling , Diana . DIANA DAWSON Oh , Lord , daddy ; still suffering from that . BELLE ( Firmly ) You did quite right , Diana . She would have been lonely having nobody to spend Christmas with . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Shrugging his shoulders ) Well , all right , all right . She 's a nice girl in her way . BELLE ( At door ) Come right in , Betty . Glad to see you , dear . ( BETTY HOWE comes in timidly and seems cheered by MRS . DAWSON 'S greeting . MRS . DAWSON brings her down to DAWSON , with her arm embracing BETTY . BETTY does not see SAM , who is concealed by DIANA as he stoops over her , taking off the rubbers . BETTY is DIANA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need of protection through a certain physical weakness in appearance . She is not a commanding character , though capable of spasmodic strength . The sympathy she inspires is due more to what she might have been rather than to what she is . ) BETTY HOWE Diana said you would n't mind , Mr. Dawson . p. 18 WILLIAM DAWSON Not at all . Glad to see all the wanderers back . Make yourself perfectly at home . BETTY HOWE I 'll try . BELLE ( Removing BETTY 'S coat ) Let me help you . ( BETTY turns as SAM rises with the rubbers in hand and looks at her steadily . DIANA watches . BETTY is startled at seeing him . ) What 's the matter , Betty ? Has the sleeve stuck ? BETTY HOWE ( Recovering ) Yes .  --  Hello , Sam . Diana did n't say you were here , too . SAM ( With a quick , suspicious glance at DIANA ) I think she knew , though . Here , Nellie .

NELLIE ( Coming down ) Have you both had dinner ? DIANA DAWSON Yes , on the train . Hands full as ever , Nellie . Still working yourself to death for Sammy and dad ? p. 19 NELLIE You 're always making fun , Diana . ( She places things out in the hall and returns . ) BELLE Are you sure you girls did n't get cold ? WILLIAM DAWSON ( At window ) Blowing up a bit . DIANA DAWSON ( Hugging BETTY ) Fairly flew with the wind , did n't we , Betty ? Sit by the fire and toast your feet . Pull the chair up for her , Sammy . ( He does so . ) BELLE It 's certainly marvelous the way you make Sammy do things . DIANA DAWSON Now he 's going to imitate a man putting on another log . SAM Think you 're funny , do n't you ? ( SAM is occupied with the fire . BETTY hesitates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAWSON ( Getting a long , narrow box she has thrown down on table ) I have something for you , dearest mother . It is n't as much as I am sure Sam must have brought you . But I 'm poor . WILLIAM DAWSON I did n't see what you brought your mother , Sam . ( SAM throws the log on with a bang . MRS . DAWSON puts her arm on DAWSON , silencing him , showing that SAM has brought nothing . DIANA opens box and takes out a single red rose. ) p. 20 DIANA DAWSON There ! Is n't it a beauty ? BELLE Oh , Diana ! It 's like yourself  --  so  --  so free ! DIANA DAWSON ( Gaily throughout ) Let me pin it on . Got a long pin , dad ? WILLIAM DAWSON Ask Nellie to get you one . ( NELLIE gives one . ) Roses in December ? DIANA DAWSON A rose , daddy . I would have stopped at the poor-house if I 'd bought a bunch . Oh , my fingers are cold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on with exclamations of admiration . ) WILLIAM DAWSON ( Glowing ) Why , Belle , you 're blushing like a schoolgirl . Nobody in town to beat you . Guess I 'd better have you go with me to the next show . We 'll get a box so people can see how pretty you still are . ( MRS . DAWSON hushes him , playfully . ) DIANA DAWSON ( Laughing ) Yes , dad , show off your property . ( She glances at SAM and BETTY while DAWSON and NELLIE are admiring the rose . ) SAM ( To BETTY , quietly ) What did you come here for ? p. 21 BETTY HOWE ( Same ) I was lonely . SAM ( Quickly ) I explained to you why I 'd been away these six weeks . You 're not going to say anything to Diana ? BETTY HOWE I think she 's guessed . SAM You 're not going to do anything , here ? BETTY HOWE I do n't know . I would n't have come if I 'd known  --   --  ( She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and covers the situation . ) DIANA DAWSON Betty , does your head still bother you ? BELLE Are you ill ? BETTY HOWE I guess it 's the warm room all of a sudden  --   --  DIANA DAWSON Would you like to lie down , dear ? BETTY HOWE ( To DIANA ) Yes ; but I must see you afterwards . SAM ( Nervously ) Eh ? DIANA DAWSON She 's to sleep with me , mother ; I 'm to have my old room ? BELLE Yes , but it 's so early yet . p. 22 BETTY HOWE I 'll only rest a moment . WILLIAM DAWSON Your room has been waiting for you two years , Diana . Nobody has slept in it since you left . DIANA DAWSON And thousands shivering in the cold ! Full of sentiment as ever , dad . Why did n't you have a light burning in the window ? BELLE Come , Betty . I 'll show you upstairs . NELLIE Let me ; you 're tired . BETTY HOWE I know the way . ( Kisses DIANA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DIANA DAWSON I 'll let you know when he comes . BETTY HOWE ( Appealingly ) Good-night , Sam . DIANA DAWSON Sam , Betty 's speaking . SAM ( Who has stood puzzled at Betty 's coming ) Oh , good-night . ( They are all silent , and pause , as they watch BETTY exit up the little stairs , followed by NELLIE . ) WILLIAM DAWSON ( Thoughtfully ) Strange about Betty Howe . DIANA DAWSON Why ? p. 23 SAM ( Not wishing them to pursue subject ) Shall we finish the Christmas things ? BELLE ( Surprised ) Why , what 's come over you , Sammy ? DIANA DAWSON Who 's been hanging them ? WILLIAM DAWSON I have . DIANA DAWSON ( Taking her mother 's arm and drawing her away from the wreaths ) We 'll have our talk later , when the two tired business men have gone to bed . BELLE Yes ; I want to hear about your two year  --   --  WILLIAM DAWSON ( Coughing , as they are apparently neglecting the work ) Here ; we 'll put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Diana , get a chair for your mother . DIANA DAWSON You get it , Sammy . ( SAM gives a grunt , and does so . ) WILLIAM DAWSON Here 's the bell . ( MRS . DAWSON starts to take it , but DIANA gently pushes it back to her father , while smiling sweetly . ) DIANA DAWSON You put it up , daddy ; mother 's tired . You wo n't have to reach so far . Hold the chair , Sam . We 'll tell you if it 's all right , daddy . ( DAWSON reluctantly gets up on chair , under chandelier , as SAM holds it , and fastens bell. ) p. 24 BELLE But let me . I 've always done it . DIANA DAWSON Yes , I remember . But this time you 'll crush your rose . ( NELLIE enters in back and is astonished at seeing DAWSON . ) NELLIE Oh , good Lord !

( PETER comes in with the bags in his hand . She greets him joyfully . NELLIE goes out back again . PETER ROW is passed thirty , with an easy-going manner , attractive in an unassuming way , and not over-particular about external appearances ; but he has a whimsical humor toward all the people he meets . He suggests a rugged honesty , coupled with a feminine tenderness , which makes him an endearing personality . ) I 'm so glad to see you . PETER ROW Are you ? WILLIAM DAWSON ( Holding bell , with his hands above his head ) Do you expect me to stand here forever ? p. 25 DIANA DAWSON Dad 's posing as a Diving Venus . WILLIAM DAWSON Never mind Venus .

PETER ROW Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect of reading our Woman 's Suffrage edition ? WILLIAM DAWSON ( Getting down ) Would n't read such stuff . DIANA DAWSON Sh ! Dad 's afraid of being influenced . WILLIAM DAWSON No broad-minded man can be influenced by the papers . PETER ROW That 's true . You 've thought about Woman 's Suffrage a lot , have n't you ? WILLIAM DAWSON Do n't have to think about something I feel . I tell you , if we had woman suffrage , women would all vote like their husbands . PETER ROW They say it would double the ignorant vote . p. 26 BELLE ( Looking about ) What 's become of our paper , Will ? PETER ROW Take mine . ( He gives it to her . DAWSON is displeased . ) BELLE There are eight million women supporting themselves ; think of that , Diana ? WILLIAM DAWSON Old maids and widows . PETER ROW Most of them supporting families .

That 's how we live . DIANA DAWSON ( Making point ) Is it true , dad ? p. 27 WILLIAM DAWSON ( After a brief , impressive pause ) You can tell your readers that when my son goes into partnership with me he 'll come home to stay . And I 'm contented to let him remain in the city for the present . SAM Did you get that , Row ? PETER ROW Sure ; young age pension . DIANA DAWSON ( Turning away thoughtfully ) So .

I mean  --   --  ( She laughs . ) It 's you , Peter Row , who put foolish , new-fangled ideas in her head about leaving home . p. 28 PETER ROW It was something God gave her . DIANA DAWSON ( Quickly ) With a little help from mother . WILLIAM DAWSON A girl leaving home to be a sculptress ! Who ever heard of it ? But I 've forgiven her , now that she 's come back to stay . PETER ROW ( Surprised ) To stay ? ( DIANA starts to deny , but her mother halts her . ) WILLIAM DAWSON So do n't spring any more of those new ideas on her . PETER ROW You flatter me .

PETER ROW The hell that was good enough for your father ought to be good enough for Sammy 's father ? WILLIAM DAWSON Exactly . p. 29 SAM Oh , cut it , Row .

( NELLIE goes up the little stairway . DIANA goes back and closes the door , shutting the others from view . She comes radiantly to PETER , holding out both hands , which he takes . The following is played with mingled humor and frankness , with a serious note underneath. ) p. 30 DIANA DAWSON Really , hello , Peter . PETER ROW Really , hello , Diana . DIANA DAWSON Glad to see me again ? PETER ROW Glad to see me ? DIANA DAWSON ( Nodding ) Hu-hum . PETER ROW Hu-hum to your question . DIANA DAWSON Your letters have been a joy .

I like and need to feel a warm hand in mine , up those five flights , getting my own meals , and sewing  --  and  --   --  Mother 's been so good  --  but dad ! p. 31 PETER ROW He 's a good-natured old fossil . DIANA DAWSON ( Playfully admonishing him ) Peter , I love him . PETER ROW I love radishes , but they do n't agree with me . If he had a new idea he 'd die of dropsy .

DIANA DAWSON You would n't wish it , even if  --  I could be persuaded to stay ? PETER ROW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand , Peter . You want me to be something . PETER ROW Yes ; more than anything else . There 's a lot of foolishness in this town that all a woman ought to do is to marry and have babies . They 're nice enough all right , but God put something pretty big into your soul and it does n't need a husband to help it along : a love of beauty and a power to make it live for others . I 've told you so often you owe something to that . DIANA DAWSON Peter , why do n't you escape from this place , too ? PETER ROW I 'm a lifer , I guess . I can think for other people and build the most beautiful plans , castles , aeroplanes , careers , and things  --  get people angry , stir them up . Maybe some day I 'll write that novel I told you of . ( Looking at her fondly ) But somehow I 'm a lazy critter and I guess I 'd better stay here and dust the geraniums . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York ? PETER ROW People see nothing but electric lights there . Here occasionally we can see the stars . DIANA DAWSON ( Going to him ) What 's the real reason you wo n't come ? PETER ROW ( Eyeing her ) Some day , when you 're a great success , I 'll tell you . DIANA DAWSON I 'll wager you wo n't even then . But I 've half a mind to be a success just for that . PETER ROW I 'll wait . DIANA DAWSON Wo n't you tell me now ? ( He shakes his head . ) Wo n't you tell me a wee little bit of something now ? PETER ROW Yes , Diana . One of the reasons I drove out  --  I almost forgot it , seeing you again . Come to the window . ( He pulls aside the curtain ) Look across the lake . See it in the moonlight , three miles across ? That 's gone up since you went away . DIANA DAWSON The dome of the new capitol ? PETER ROW Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so beautiful every time even I pass it I feel like taking off my hat and praying . Tough on the politicians . p. 33 DIANA DAWSON Do you feel as though you were praying when you see something beautiful ? PETER ROW Yes ; but I do a heap of cussing . DIANA DAWSON ( Mock seriously ) Father 's terra-cotta has damns written all over it . PETER ROW ( Pointing ) There 's a vacant pedestal in front of the approach  --  like an altar . And a statue is to go on it . DIANA DAWSON A statue ? Is this where I come in ? PETER ROW You 've got me . It 's to be symbolic . DIANA DAWSON Something everybody will disagree about ? PETER ROW Yesterday " The Times " heard they 'd decided to have an open competition ; secret , of course , you know . I thought it would be a fine thing for this burg if " the female of the species "  --   --  DIANA DAWSON ( Joyfully ) Oh , Peter , would n't it be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awful joke on your father . DIANA DAWSON But would n't mother be happy ! p. 34 PETER ROW By the way , it was her old friend , Oliver Hardman , who told me . He 's coming out to see her to-morrow , he said . But you must n't tell him your intentions because he 's been appointed on the Legislative Committee as judge . He 's down to get a line on it . I pumped him a bit . I know what he thinks appropriate . DIANA DAWSON What ? PETER ROW Something they can call " Democracy . " No relation to any of our present parties . DIANA DAWSON ( With a flash , glancing at the newspaper MRS . DAWSON has left on the table ) " Democracy " ! ( She gazes rapt before her . ) I 've got it now . I see it , do n't you ? PETER ROW Never have yet in this country . DIANA DAWSON That 's it ! PETER ROW Put me wise . DIANA DAWSON Oh , I wo n't tell even you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Significantly ) But it 's got a woman in it . ( There is a slight pause and BETTY nervously comes down the little stairs and closes the door . ) BETTY HOWE Peter ! PETER ROW ( Greeting as a very old friend ) Glad to see you , Betty Howe . p. 35 DIANA DAWSON You 've rested ? BETTY HOWE ( Nervously ) Where are the others ? DIANA DAWSON ( Opening door in back and looking out ) Helping father . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Outside ) A little higher , Belle . BETTY HOWE ( To PETER , so DIANA ca n't hear ) I could n't stay another moment without Diana 's knowing . PETER ROW ( Surprised ) You 've not told her ? BETTY HOWE ( Quickly ) I could n't . I was afraid you might , now that Sammy  --   --  PETER ROW It was not mine to tell . But you promised . BETTY HOWE I always fall down , do n't I ? ( DIANA laughs and closes the door . ) Now , what will Diana say ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage ) Diana ! What made you bring me here ? DIANA DAWSON ( Subtly realizing the seriousness of it ) What made you come ? p. 36 BETTY HOWE I do n't know . There 's something always seems to drag people back , is n't there ? PETER ROW Or keep them anchored . BETTY HOWE ( Nervously throughout ) Did you know Sammy was coming here , too ? DIANA DAWSON ( Calmly ) Yes ; mother wrote me . BETTY HOWE And you suspected ? DIANA DAWSON I knew only that when he was at college you were fond of each other . BETTY HOWE And when mother died a year ago you thought I went to the city to  --   --  ? DIANA DAWSON Lots of people go to the city , Betty . It 's the modern disease . I 'm even trying to get Peter there . BETTY HOWE But not to be together as  --  oh , no ! You 're not the sort who would hide things . DIANA DAWSON ( Going to her , tenderly ) You said you were living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any questions when you came to see me ? You knew I had no money and was not earning any . DIANA DAWSON For the same reason I always wrote before I came . p. 37 BETTY HOWE Because you knew somebody was paying my bills . Is n't that it ? DIANA DAWSON I knew you were Betty  --  " Betty Howe around the corner , "  --  who had the run of our home here when we three were all kids together . BETTY HOWE But you knew it was Sam who was coming to see me ? ( DIANA nods . ) And you could still ask me to come back here to your home ? DIANA DAWSON ( Simply ) Why not , if he could come , too ? BETTY HOWE ( Crumpling ) Oh , and I was afraid to tell you . PETER ROW Betty would n't let me . DIANA DAWSON ( Surprised ) You knew ? BETTY HOWE Oh , it is n't so terrible . Except Sam thought , when I went with him after mother died  --  oh , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened , it would raise such a rumpus with our parents . Peter had found out . PETER ROW I was on another story in a burg near here , mixing in people 's private affairs , being a good reporter . It was before a license was necessary in this state and  --   --  p. 38 DIANA DAWSON ( Surprised ) Married ? PETER ROW Yes . BETTY HOWE Three years ago . DIANA DAWSON Betty ! ( SAM enters from back and sees the situation . He leaves the doors open . The others outside are not seen . PETER and DIANA watch him as he comes down ; then BETTY looks up and rises and holds out her hands to him for forgiveness at having told . Then , with a sob , she goes out and up the little stairs . SAM sees they know that he is married . There is a pause . ) PETER ROW Guess I 'd better be going , Diana . DIANA DAWSON To-morrow , Peter ? PETER ROW Yes . I 'm driving Mr. Hardman out to see your mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emphatically ) Now remember this is my affair . She 's my wife . Let me handle it my way . I do n't intend to live in this place unless I have to . Understand ? DIANA DAWSON ( Firmly ) I 'll give you till to-morrow , Sammy . Good-night , Peter . PETER ROW Good-night . ( PETER goes off , and DAWSON and MRS . DAWSON are faintly heard speaking to him . SAM looks at DIANA and then back at the others as DIANA gives him a long , questioning look and crosses to the window. ) p. 39 SAM I 've got some say . I did the decent thing by her . Married her first . That 's more than most men . DIANA DAWSON ( Scornfully ) The decent thing by her . I wonder . SAM I do n't care how much you wonder if you shut up . ( He yanks the chair around , pulls out a cigarette , lights it , and stretches before the fire again as DIANA sits gazing at him . ) DIANA DAWSON To-morrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DAWSON , comes down , closing the back doors . MRS . DAWSON sits by lamp and begins to sew , but records her impressions of the following as she listens intently . DAWSON sees his son and daughter . ) WILLIAM DAWSON ( Beaming ) Ah , the family all together for once . ( Takes DIANA 's hand ) Glad you 're back , little girl ! We 've missed you . Where 's my pipe , Belle ? BELLE Where you left it . WILLIAM DAWSON ( As he finds pipe and lights it ) The first time it seems like home in two years , eh , Belle ? Nothing like having the chicks right under our wing . p. 40 DIANA DAWSON ( Abruptly ) Father , why does n't Sammy stay here and accept your partnership ? SAM ( Quickly ) Why did n't you stay at home and help mother ? DIANA DAWSON I had my work . SAM So had I. DIANA DAWSON How much is Sam making , dad ? SAM Cut it . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Complacently ) Takes time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Insistently ) But he is n't making any money ? WILLIAM DAWSON ( Reluctantly ) Nothing to speak of . DIANA DAWSON Do n't worry , Sammy ; neither am I. WILLIAM DAWSON ( To SAM ) That 's why Diana 's come back . DIANA DAWSON ( Quickly ) Do n't misunderstand , dad . WILLIAM DAWSON ( After eyeing her a second in doubt ) Not at all . We all make mistakes  --  especially when we 're young . p. 41 DIANA DAWSON But I made no mistake . WILLIAM DAWSON You will have your little joke . DIANA DAWSON I 'm like you , father . WILLIAM DAWSON Then perhaps you understand my feelings when you left a little better . I could n't get it into my head how any girl could leave a home like this , where you have everything  --  trees , flowers , fresh air , and a lake view that 's the best in the county . DIANA DAWSON ( Looking out window and leaving curtains open , with moonlight coming in ) And where one can see the dome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WILLIAM DAWSON Sammy had to leave . It 's the way with sons . But I thought you would stay here where I passed my childhood and you were born and had all your early associations . Why , your mother has hardly ever even wanted to leave here . But you had to up and go . DIANA DAWSON Yes . I had to . BELLE ( Wishing to avoid the discussion ) Do n't let 's talk of this to-night . WILLIAM DAWSON Had to ? Who made you ? DIANA DAWSON Something inside . Here  --  burning and singing . p. 42 WILLIAM DAWSON ( Emphatically ) Rot ! BELLE She 's only come home , Will . Do n't make it hard for her again . WILLIAM DAWSON Because I 'm her father and objected to her leaving you all alone ? That 's unkind of you , Belle . DIANA DAWSON ( Good-naturedly ) Father thinks I am still crazy  --  oh , you said so  --  because I wanted to go to the city and make marble live . SAM Funny reason to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're over that foolishness , are n't you ? DIANA DAWSON ( Facing the issue ) That 's just where you 're mistaken , dad . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Soberly ) Then you 're not going to stay with your mother and me ? DIANA DAWSON Since you made it easy for me by writing . I 'll come and see you very often . WILLIAM DAWSON And make a hotel of our home ? Not much . ( Controlling himself ) Now , Diana , your mother 's getting old and feeble . p. 43 BELLE ( Emphatically ) Nothing of the kind , Will . WILLIAM DAWSON I know better . Suppose anything should happen to your mother ? What would I do ? DIANA DAWSON ( Laughing ) So you are thinking of yourself , daddy . WILLIAM DAWSON I 'm thinking of a girl 's place at home with her parents till she marries , doing a woman 's work . I 'm not proud of having my daughter off earning her own living as though I could n't support her . DIANA DAWSON ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how could I stay at home when it was you who made me go ? WILLIAM DAWSON ( Bewildered ) Me ? DIANA DAWSON ( Whimsically ) Yes . You and the turtle . WILLIAM DAWSON The turtle ? SAM She 's crazy , all right . DIANA DAWSON ( Fancifully throughout ) Yes , the dear , dear turtle . I 've laughed so many times when I think of what little things determine our lives . Do you remember that day  --  long ago  --  when I was a real little lady , and Sammy was n't such a gentleman ? Of course you do n't . Nellie was sick and mother had taken Sammy to the dentist for something and you had to stay home and take care of me . You ought to remember that day : you said you had such a headache when it was over . You were so happy taking a woman 's place that you fell asleep from exhaustion . That was my chance . Destiny opened the door and I went out into the garden . It was all flowers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw a turtle : a poor , lonely , little turtle ; oh , so lonely I felt sorry for it  --  because you had mother and Sammy and me , and the little turtle had n't anybody . Somehow I wanted the turtle to have some little turtles so she would n't be so lonely . You see , you ought to have told me where turtles and babies came from . p. 44 WILLIAM DAWSON A young girl should n't  --   --  DIANA DAWSON So I held the turtle with a stone and took the clay  --  almost the same color as its dirty back  --  and I began to make a turtle . I rounded it , put legs and two heads on it  --  so it could go in either direction  --  and it seemed to move before my eyes . I 'd made a turtle out of clay ! And something stirred within me . I 've never lost it , dad ; never forgot that first thrill inside , which told me I could make things live by molding them with my fingers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , daddy , it 's here , always here inside , and I know if I keep at work I will succeed . I know  --  I know . And just think ; if you had n't fallen asleep and left the door open , I should never have entered into my garden . ( There is a pause . DAWSON looks bewildered . SAM sneers . MRS . DAWSON gazes before her , apparently deeply moved by DIANA 'S words , which she has followed eagerly throughout . ) WILLIAM DAWSON Have you any clear idea what she 's talking about , Belle ? BELLE I think I understand . WILLIAM DAWSON I do n't . Do you , Sammy ? SAM Plenty of men can make statues . p. 45 WILLIAM DAWSON " Something inside . " I never felt anything like that troubling me . BELLE So many people use the same words , but can not understand each other . SAM Rot ! WILLIAM DAWSON Well , you seem to think it 's mighty important , whatever it is . But what have you got to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sammy . SAM You seem to think we 're alike . DIANA DAWSON ( Emphatically ) No , I do n't !  --  But I keep on working and trying : when I 'm tired I go see all the wonderful dancers ; for they are statues in motion  --   --  WILLIAM DAWSON ( Suspiciously ) You said you were making no money . DIANA DAWSON Climb my five flights and see how I live . WILLIAM DAWSON But you live . DIANA DAWSON ( Radiantly ) Wonderfully ! WILLIAM DAWSON And can afford to go to the opera and dances and  --   --  DIANA DAWSON Why this sudden curiosity , dad ? You never inquired before . p. 46 WILLIAM DAWSON Who 's been paying your bills ? Do you mind telling me ? DIANA DAWSON I do n't mind ,  --  but I ca n't . WILLIAM DAWSON ( With growing intensity ) I think I have the right to ask that . DIANA DAWSON What right ? WILLIAM DAWSON I 'm your father . DIANA DAWSON ( Earnestly ) Father , when I was at home you thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you paid for my food and clothes . When you took that from me , you ceased to have that right . ( More tenderly ) You 're forgetting , daddy , that since I 've left you 've not helped me with my work nor given me a penny . WILLIAM DAWSON ( After an uncomfortable moment ) But you have n't answered my question ? DIANA DAWSON ( Calmly ) I thought I had . BELLE Will ,  --   --  SAM ( Starting up ) I wrote you , dad , what would happen to a girl alone in the city without a man 's protection . p. 47 DIANA DAWSON Sammy , you 're funny . SAM You ought to be ashamed of yourself . WILLIAM DAWSON Diana , I 'm serious . DIANA DAWSON So am I. That 's why I 'm laughing at Sammy 's sudden desire to consider ( pointedly ) his family . ( SAM subsides . ) WILLIAM DAWSON ( Losing patience ) You 're evading my question . DIANA DAWSON I 'm not insulting something I love . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Forcibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DIANA DAWSON Why a man ? WILLIAM DAWSON Damn them , I know them . SAM So do I. WILLIAM DAWSON You shut up , Sammy . Answer me , daughter . ( Broken ) You have n't  --   --  ? Answer me . Good God , girl ! ( Taking both her shoulders forcibly . ) Answer me . DIANA DAWSON ( Calmly looking at him ) No , daddy . Maybe I 'm not attractive enough to be endowed . p. 48 WILLIAM DAWSON ( Believing her after a long gaze into her eyes ) There 's only one who could honestly help you . Was it Sammy ? DIANA DAWSON That 's funny , too . SAM You bet it is . BELLE ( Putting aside her work ) Are men the only ones who help women ? ( DAWSON looks at her incredulously . ) Tell him , Diana ; it 's best now . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Incredulously ) You knew ? And you kept it from me ? BELLE ( With some slight hesitation at first , and then with increasing courage and firmness ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brush , since just before we were married , Will . I had an odd little idea I thought might sell as a specialty ; paper dolls , with separate sheets of water-colored clothes to put on them . They are so much softer than the printed kind , and children like anything soft . I wrote about it to Mr. Hardman . He had been so kind to me years before at the Art School . He thought I had had such promise . He found an opportunity to use the dolls . They caught on in the best shops . They pay me very well . I made enough each month to help Diana when she went behind . p. 49 WILLIAM DAWSON ( Dumbfounded ) You ? After you heard me say when she left I would n't give her a cent ? BELLE ( Tartly ) You were keeping Sam , were n't you ? WILLIAM DAWSON That 's different . BELLE I did n't see why we should n't help both our children . WILLIAM DAWSON ( After some confusion ) And you took it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew how she got the money ? DIANA DAWSON Yes . SAM Mother working herself sick for you  --   --  BELLE ( Firmly ) I told you I have never been so happy  --  never . DIANA DAWSON ( With kindness going to him ) Dad , I do n't mean to be unkind  --  but I had to study . You would n't recognize what it meant to me . I had to live . Sam and I both went against your will in leaving home  --  but you helped him because he was your son ; I was only your daughter . ( There is a long pause . DIANA goes to her mother and kisses her silently , showing the close bond between them . DAWSON is cornered and does n't seem to know what to say . He starts to speak several times and stops. ) p. 50 WILLIAM DAWSON You seem to think boys and girls are the same , but they 're not . Men and women are different . ( Hesitating ) Why , Diana , you may not know it but your mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew her . ( MRS . DAWSON starts to protest . ) DIANA DAWSON ( Surprised ) Mother ? WILLIAM DAWSON Yes ; you did n't know that , did you ? She was poor and did n't have a mother to support her  --   --  BELLE Oh , hush , Will  --   --  WILLIAM DAWSON Well , you had to work for a living  --  did n't you ? Had to , mind you  --  ( To DIANA ) She 'd about given up when I met her in the city  --  trying to work at night to feed herself in the day while studying Art . ( MRS . DAWSON gazes before her , thinking , as DIANA has come close to her . ) DIANA DAWSON Mother ! WILLIAM DAWSON But she was sensible ; when a good man came along who could support her she married him and settled down . Look how happy she 's been here  --  here with a home of her own and associations and children . Where would she be to-day trying to paint pictures for a living ? There 's lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and too few wives for hard-working , decent men who want a family  --  which is God 's law . That 's why I helped Sammy and not you . He 'll have to support a family some day . You wo n't if you marry the right sort of man . You 'll find out I was right when you marry and have children like your mother . p. 51 DIANA DAWSON ( Wistfully ) And now her children have both left her . Dear mother , what has she to do ? WILLIAM DAWSON What has she to do ? Well , just you wait : you 'll see what a good wife has to do for her husband . DIANA DAWSON But , daddy dear  --  suppose the right man does n't come or ( thinking of PETER ) does n't even ask me ? WILLIAM DAWSON ( Trying to answer her and then giving it up testily ) Why  --  why  --  it 's getting too late to answer any such silly questions . ( DIANA smiles . ) Sammy , you go to bed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to support you both in the city I 'm going to have some say . I do n't intend to open you to dangers , Diana . Sam 's got to look out for you and live with you , see ? DIANA DAWSON But  --   --  BELLE ( Halting her ) Not now , dear . SAM ( Sarcastically ) Fine . I 'll spend all my time posing for a cupid , eh , Diana ? DIANA DAWSON ( Significantly ) As I said , you and I , Sam , will talk over everything to-morrow . ( SAM gives her a look and goes out back and upstairs . DAWSON turns , after watching him go off , and looks for a while at the two women seated together. ) p. 52 WILLIAM DAWSON I 'll have to help you make a fool of yourself , Diana , if you 've made up your mind . It is n't easy for me to back down ; you 're wrong but you 're stubborn . ( He goes close to MRS . DAWSON and pats her ) Painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been sending Diana the money without ever feeling it ! No more of that , Belle ; you 've got to stop your painting , understand ? BELLE ( Startled ) Stop my painting ? WILLIAM DAWSON Yes ; I do n't intend having you get sick with work . BELLE ( Starting to protest ) But  --   --  WILLIAM DAWSON ( With finality ) You do n't have to any longer ; I wo n't have it , either . That 's one thing I draw the line at . I 'll lock up . ( As he goes up he turns out the switch in back ; the room is in darkness , save for the moonlight upon the two women seated together , the faint glow from the fire , and the soft light in back hall . DIANA has been watching MRS . DAWSON intently with a sudden realization of all the painting has meant to her . ) DIANA DAWSON ( Taking her hand in great love and understanding throughout ) Mother ! p. 53 BELLE ( Quietly gazing before her , unheard by DAWSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Art school Mr. Hardman said I had a lovely sense of color . Your father is so kind , but he does n't know how much I enjoyed painting again  --  even those little paper dolls . DIANA DAWSON ( Slowly and with wonder ) Mother , you too ! ! BELLE Yes ; like you . DIANA DAWSON Oh , dearest mother , now I understand . All these years you 've never wanted to give up your painting ? BELLE I 'm lonely here . DIANA DAWSON And now he 's taken it from you again . That 's cruel  --  cruel . BELLE Your father does n't understand . DIANA DAWSON Then we must make him . BELLE I do n't think I could . DIANA DAWSON I 'll help you . Oh , he sha n't take your little painting from you if it makes you happy  --  he sha n't . BELLE It 's too late for me to enter my garden . The door has been shut too long . DIANA DAWSON ( With determination ) To-morrow you and I will open the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( DAWSON re-enters to the door in back with a lighted candle : he has put out the hall light . ) WILLIAM DAWSON ( Looks at them a second ) Good-night . Painting ? Huh ! Well , thank goodness , I 've been able to settle that foolishness ! Huh ! ( He turns , shaking his head , and as he goes slowly up the stairs the two women draw closer together in the moonlight ) @x The Same Scene . The Next Morning , Sunday . ( The Curtain goes up with DIANA humming as she surveys the room , with a definite intention . NELLIE enters from the little stairs with a tray . ) DIANA DAWSON Betty was awake ? NELLIE Yes , she 'd only take coffee and rolls . She told me to tell you she would n't get up for a while yet . DIANA DAWSON ( In gay spirits ) Ever feel like dancing , Nellie ? NELLIE Me ? DIANA DAWSON I have all morning . NELLIE ( Astonished ) Here ? DIANA DAWSON Yes , even here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing ? What are you doing ? DIANA DAWSON Sh ! Nellie ! ( Whispering as she takes the terracotta and places it on desk in back ) We 're raising the Devil . NELLIE Has your father said you could ? DIANA DAWSON No , but mother has . And this is her home , too , you know . Now help me push the things about . ( While they are talking , much to NELLIE 'S astonishment and in spite of her protestations , they take the cover off the table , which they push over to the window . NELLIE folds the cover carefully , etc . DIANA delighted . DAWSON enters in back . He gazes at them in astonishment. ) p. 56 NELLIE Oh , Lord ! WILLIAM DAWSON Would you mind telling me what you 're doing ? DIANA DAWSON ( Not stopping ) Trying to please mother , daddy dear . WILLIAM DAWSON Your mother ? DIANA DAWSON Yes . She 's tired of having the place just so . Thought we 'd change it about . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Sits down ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hope I 'm not interrupting you . DIANA DAWSON Not at all . I was asking Nellie what time she got to bed last night . NELLIE Eleven o'clock . DIANA DAWSON What time did you get up ? NELLIE Six . DIANA DAWSON ( Mock tragically ) Daddy , Nellie 's working eighteen hours a day . WILLIAM DAWSON What do you think this is , a Union Shop ? DIANA DAWSON That depends on how much you pay her . NELLIE Twenty dollars a month . p. 57 WILLIAM DAWSON With board and keep . DIANA DAWSON I was just wondering how you stand it , Nellie . Why do n't you have another girl to help her out ? WILLIAM DAWSON If you were at home long enough to get acquainted you 'd know your mother does that . DIANA DAWSON But mother is n't going to do that any more , dad . WILLIAM DAWSON Eh ? DIANA DAWSON She 's promised me she would n't . ( Whispering comically ) She 's going on a strike . WILLIAM DAWSON A strike ? NELLIE Sure , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tray in back and returns . ) DIANA DAWSON It 's worse . It 's an old-fashioned home . ( Burlesquing ) Where father comes at night and mother works all day . WILLIAM DAWSON Is that one of those popular songs ? DIANA DAWSON It 's very popular just now . I hummed it to mother last night . It 's the Woman 's Pilgrim Chorus . WILLIAM DAWSON So you 're trying to put some new-fangled ideas into her head , too ? p. 58 DIANA DAWSON No . I 'm only urging mother not to give up her painting . That 's not so terrible , is it ? WILLIAM DAWSON But she does n't have to paint now . DIANA DAWSON Yes , she does : to be happy and make you happy . ( Hugging him ) Oh , if you only knew that , daddy dear . And she needs the north light , so she 'd like to paint down here . And I 'm honoring my fifth commandment , as you told me I always should . WILLIAM DAWSON But  --   --  ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . They look at each other ; she smiles sweetly at him . ) BELLE You 're back early this morning , Will . WILLIAM DAWSON You 've apparently forgotten it 's Sunday . BELLE So it is . I felt so happy . ( She places the things on the table as he watches her , puzzled . ) DIANA DAWSON Better bring down the rest of mother 's kit , Nellie . BELLE You will find it all together , ready . NELLIE ( As she goes upstairs ) I often wondered what a strike was like . p. 59 WILLIAM DAWSON Belle ? BELLE Yes , dear . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Puzzled ) Do you like to do this ? BELLE Yes , Will . WILLIAM DAWSON Well , I suppose if you like it ; but  --   --  BELLE But what ? WILLIAM DAWSON You 're pretty old to be taking up those tricks again . We 'll have a talk later . Is Sammy up yet , Diana ? DIANA DAWSON No , he 's resting after his hard day 's work . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mistaken . WILLIAM DAWSON H 'm . I 'd better call him . Matters appear to be going all to pieces here . ( He goes upstairs , slowly shaking his head . ) DIANA DAWSON ( Gaily at table ) Cardboard , brushes , thumb tacks , blotters . ( Noticing MRS . DAWSON , who has seated herself in chair , lost in thought . She goes to her and they play the following with greatest affection and sympathy . ) What is it , mother dear ? BELLE Is your father right ? Am I too old ? Am I making myself ridiculous ? p. 60 DIANA DAWSON Nonsense , mother dear . Too old to try to be completely happy ? Why , dearest , who could laugh at you ? BELLE I 've accepted so many years the way things are . DIANA DAWSON To-day ushers in a new era in the home of Dawson and Wife . BELLE I 'm fifty , Diana . DIANA DAWSON ( Buoyantly throughout ) Nonsense , mother . You 're a girl  --  my age  --  with wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they bloomed to meet dad 's love , and when we sat before the fire and you told me of the dreams you once had when you were working to be something , as I am working now . Why , dearest mother , your ambition has never left you . ( Playfully ) You get that from me . BELLE ( Smiling ) I 'm fifty . It 's hard to break from the habit of a lifetime . DIANA DAWSON To go back to its early dreams ? BELLE ( Timidly and sweetly ) Do you think I could ? DIANA DAWSON ( Emphatically ) Yes , and you will . BELLE ( Wistfully ) I 've always wanted to paint , but I 'm afraid the fingers have lost their skill . The hands are not so steady and the eyes are tired . But I feel it just the same . I do n't think your father would let me study again here . You do n't know him . p. 61 DIANA DAWSON He does n't know my mother . BELLE She does n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very sweetly ) is it so terrible for a wife to want to leave home sometimes and be with her daughter ? DIANA DAWSON Mother ! BELLE ( Quickly ) Do n't misunderstand me , child . I love your father . He 's been kind and good in his way . But I get so lonely for you  --  just for you , dear . DIANA DAWSON ( Hugging her ) And I want you so . It gets so lonely for me up five flights and no one to tuck up to when things go wrong . BELLE Would n't it be wonderful , dear , if  --  if we could be together again ? DIANA DAWSON Do you wish me to come back ? BELLE ( Quickly ) No , no . I would n't have you give up your work for the world . I love to think of you way off there  --   --  DIANA DAWSON ( Gaily ) Up five flights of stairs , a studio , and a tiny bedroom , thirty dollars a month ? Cooking on a rickety gas stove , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white marble tower reaching up toward Heaven ? p. 62 BELLE They did n't have such high towers in my day , but we dreamed the same way . And , Diana , I want to confess something . I 've never stopped dreaming . I live my own days over thinking of you . But a mother 's arms get so lonely when the children go . DIANA DAWSON They always go , do n't they , mother ? ( With a sudden thought ) Unless the children take her along with them . Mother , why do n't you come to me for a long visit ? BELLE I told you last night I do n't think I really could leave your father . DIANA DAWSON Even to be with your daughter ? BELLE Oh , Diana , I 'd love to be with you for all it would mean to me ; but your father would n't let me go for a long visit . DIANA DAWSON He tried to crush everything out of me with his blindness and lack of understanding . Now he understands better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart 's desire . BELLE I told you I was fifty . PETER ROW ( Outside , tapping on door ) May I come in , Diana ? DIANA DAWSON ( All confused ) Peter ! BELLE ( Realizing completely her love for PETER ) " Your heart 's desire . " Diana , then it is true ? You and Peter ? p. 63 DIANA DAWSON ( Kissing her mother ) He 's never said a word . He 'll never take me from you , dear ; he does n't think an artist should marry . BELLE ( Gazing before her ) Men are so different . PETER ROW ( Opening the door ) Please may I come in ? Good-morning , MRS . Dawson . ( PETER comes in . MRS . DAWSON goes to him , takes both his hands , looks into his astonished eyes , and then starts towards the little stairs . ) BELLE ( Quietly ) I 'll see if Betty needs anything . ( MRS . DAWSON goes out . ) PETER ROW ( Puzzled by her manner ) What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's moved , and mother 's on the warpath . PETER ROW ( Astonished ) Your mother ? DIANA DAWSON Father 's only wife , yes . PETER ROW Good for her . The way she looked at me I thought  --   --  DIANA DAWSON What ? p. 64 PETER ROW Oh , I do n't know . As though I 'd stolen something from her . DIANA DAWSON Maybe that 's it , Peter . PETER ROW You did n't tell her I spoke of the statue ? DIANA DAWSON No ; it was n't that . PETER ROW Then you knew why she looked at me that way ? DIANA DAWSON Do n't you , Peter ? PETER ROW I would n't dare tell you what I thought . DIANA DAWSON ( Frankly and without coquetry ) Go as far as you like , Peter . PETER ROW ( Smiling ) That 's how a man gets in trouble . DIANA DAWSON Are you afraid of getting in trouble ? PETER ROW A man does n't get in trouble alone . DIANA DAWSON There 's a woman in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And there 's room for it . Like the statue . PETER ROW ( Puzzled ) Room for it ? p. 65 DIANA DAWSON Yes . I walked into town early this morning and looked at the pedestal . There 's room for my statue , Peter . I 'm going to try to do it . PETER ROW I 'm so glad there 's room . DIANA DAWSON ( With feeling ) For more than a statue , Peter . Every pedestal in the world has room for something we can worship and love . PETER ROW Something beautiful , like a woman 's heart ? DIANA DAWSON ( Looking up at him with frank love ) Or a man 's . PETER ROW ( Gazes at her , after a slight pause , with the same expression ) Is n't this funny talk for eleven o'clock in the morning ? ( They laugh and turn from each other . ) Has Sammy broken the news to them ? DIANA DAWSON He 's not up yet . ( Re-enter MRS . DAWSON . ) BELLE Peter , why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with you . PETER ROW ( Nonplused ) I clean plum forgot it . And he 's got to make the noon train . DIANA DAWSON Bring him out of that horrible plush parlor right away . Do n't wait to say anything funny . Go ! ( PETER exits in back . MRS . DAWSON has been standing , lost in thought. ) p. 66 BELLE It 's been over twenty-five years . DIANA DAWSON And Mr. Hardman liked your painting ? BELLE Yes . He was so kind . Now he 'll see you as I was . ( Enter OLIVER HARDMAN , followed by PETER , who joins DIANA . OLIVER HARDMAN is in the late sixties , still full of physical vigor and possessing a great charm of personality . His speech is soft in accent but sure in meaning . One feels his human understanding , for life has apparently brought its full share of disappointments . ) OLIVER HARDMAN ( Coming to MRS : DAWSON ) , And this is Belle Patterson ? BELLE ( Sweetly ) The same . I 'd have known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so little ? BELLE They 've brought you fame and gray hairs . OLIVER HARDMAN I could n't help the latter . And they 've brought you ? BELLE Me ? OLIVER HARDMAN ( Looking about ) Happiness , home , and children . You are very fortunate . p. 67 BELLE You 've met my daughter Diana ? ( DIANA comes forward . He takes her frank , open hand and holds it a moment , gazing at her with a sweet smile on his lips . ) OLIVER HARDMAN That 's strange . You gave me your hand just like your mother used to when she was your age . DIANA DAWSON ( Impulsively ) I knew from last night I 'd fall in love with you at first sight . ( He laughs admonishingly . ) ( MR . DAWSON enters down the small stairs . ) You 've met dad ? This is Mr. Hardman , father , who has been so good to mother . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Restrained ) How do you do ? Sit down . OLIVER HARDMAN ( Good-naturedly ) I can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROW Guilty . OLIVER HARDMAN But first let me congratulate you , Mr. Dawson , on getting the contract at the Capitol . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Quickly ) They took my bid ? OLIVER HARDMAN The general contractor was an old friend . I was with him this morning . Your bid and Tenner 's were the same . He asked me if I knew you ( significantly ) and I think the coin will fall on your side . p. 68 WILLIAM DAWSON ( His entire manner changing to one of pleasure ) Thank you ; have a cigar . My plumbing supplies are the best . OLIVER HARDMAN I 'm not smoking just now . I really came out , through a sentimental whim , to see MRS . Dawson and to ask if she still had a picture she once painted . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Manner changed ) Oh ! BELLE ( Surprised ) One of my pictures ? WILLIAM DAWSON ( Loftily ) She gave up painting when she married . DIANA DAWSON ( Mischievously ) That 's father 's little joke , Mr. Hardman . BELLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketch  --  a seashore  --  a bit of green and a tree . You see how well I remember it . BELLE ( Brightening and with interest ) I have that yet . OLIVER HARDMAN Might I see it again ? BELLE Let me have the keys , Will . ( DAWSON gives her the keys , not pleased with the situation , as she goes to the bottom drawer of desk and takes out a portfolio containing a number of cardboard water-color paintings . DIANA helps her enthusiastically. ) p. 69 OLIVER HARDMAN ( To DAWSON ) Your wife had a splendid talent , Mr. Dawson . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Dismissing it ) Yes , yes . And she 's a good wife and mother ; that 's better . ( HARDMAN smiles , and begins to understand the situation . DIANA brings down the painting to HARDMAN . He gazes at it a long while . ) OLIVER HARDMAN ( Tenderly ) Yes ; that 's it . DIANA DAWSON ( Looking over his shoulder ) It is lovely , is n't it ? Why did n't you show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Somehow I hated to look over them again . OLIVER HARDMAN More than lovely ! DIANA DAWSON Come ; just look , daddy . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Looking at it ) You can see a tree like that anywheres . Why paint a thing when you can photograph it so much quicker ? ( HARDMAN gives a quick glance at DAWSON and then at MRS . DAWSON , who looks down as Mr. HARDMAN realizes DAWSON 'S opposition. ) p. 70 OLIVER HARDMAN I suppose you wonder why I wished to see this again ? BELLE I 'd like to know why ? It was my favorite , too . OLIVER HARDMAN ( Half smiling at himself for telling ) Well , I will tell you . PETER ROW Is this for publication ? OLIVER HARDMAN ( Laughing ) I 'm afraid not : it 's the truth . WILLIAM DAWSON You 're never safe with these newspaper men . DIANA DAWSON Anything beautiful is safe with Peter . ( HARDMAN senses the situation between PETER and DIANA . ) Tell us , Mr. Hardman . OLIVER HARDMAN When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not afraid of talking about yourself and feelings , eh , Mr. Dawson ? WILLIAM DAWSON How should I know ? OLIVER HARDMAN ( Looking at picture ) The background is good . The pinks and blues of the sky melt together , and the horizon line is lost in the haze , as it should be . Suggestion . The secret of beauty . You ca n't tell where the sea ends . The infinite space of it . The foreground is a bit soft  --  too sketchy . I think the tone of the green is not quite true . p. 71 BELLE It has faded a trifle . OLIVER HARDMAN ( After a quick glance at her ) But the tree , dull , dark , leaning away from the winds that you feel have driven over it for years ! It stands so alone without a leaf . How did you ever manage to catch the sense of its being so utterly alone ? BELLE ( With simplicity ) Why , I just imagined what it must be like  --  to be there with only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I remember the day when you showed it to me , do you ? BELLE ( Recalling with enthusiasm ) Yes , at the studio . It must have been a mood I was in that made me paint it . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Complacently ) That was before she married me . Women get lonely when they 're not yoked . OLIVER HARDMAN ( Smiling good-naturedly ) Only then ? WILLIAM DAWSON ( Pointedly ) Are you married ? OLIVER HARDMAN ( Smiling ) Not yet . p. 72 WILLIAM DAWSON ( Settling back complacently in his chair ) It 's hard for outsiders to understand marriage . OLIVER HARDMAN ( Referring to painting ) But I do know how this " yoked " itself in my mind . I 've never forgotten it . It 's always come up before my eyes when I  --  I felt utterly alone . ( More seriously ) And it taught me the beauty of sadness  --  of how art can speak to the soul when life about is dead : of what beauty there may still be in a life without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if only we all are artists enough to  --  how shall I say ? To live beautifully . Do you understand ? DIANA DAWSON ( Radiantly ) I do . OLIVER HARDMAN ( Smiling ) You ? One so young ? DIANA DAWSON You mean it made you live better ? OLIVER HARDMAN ( Admitting it ) How did you know that ? DIANA DAWSON ( Fancifully , as she and HARDMAN gaze at the picture ) Maybe one of the little birds flying just outside of the picture told me . ( DAWSON squirms uneasily in chair as NELLIE enters with MRS . DAWSON 'S paint boxes . He sees them. ) p. 73 WILLIAM DAWSON ( Sarcastically ) Are you taking up painting , too , Nellie ? NELLIE What 's come over this house ? Diana wanted to know if I was taking up dancing . WILLIAM DAWSON What are those paints and brushes doing here ? BELLE ( Turning from HARDMAN , who observes ) They are mine , Will , you know . DIANA DAWSON Mother 's going to study again . Did n't I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S presence ) Oh , I forgot . OLIVER HARDMAN ( Half admonishingly to MRS . DAWSON ) Had you let your painting go entirely ? BELLE ( Courageously ) Yes . But do you agree with Mr. Dawson : that I 'm too old to get back where I was ? OLIVER HARDMAN Not if the hand has n't lost too much with the years . BELLE ( Looking at DAWSON ) I thought I might try . Your words have made me sure I must . WILLIAM DAWSON Must ? p. 74 OLIVER HARDMAN You can always count on my help , if you and Mr. Dawson should come to the city for models or study . ( DAWSON squirms uncomfortably . ) DIANA DAWSON ( Quickly ) Oh , daddy ; is n't Mr. Hardman a good friend to help mother with her painting and you with your plumbing ! WILLIAM DAWSON ( Drily ) Thanks . When we come we 'll be glad to have it . DIANA DAWSON ( With vivacity ) Daddy , I did n't know you 'd consent . WILLIAM DAWSON Consent ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , away from mother and you . OLIVER HARDMAN That 's so . You are living there alone now . DIANA DAWSON Yes . Father 's helping me . ( DAWSON squirms in chair . ) OLIVER HARDMAN That 's splendid of you , Mr. Dawson . It 's seldom that fathers of our generation understand the needs of their children . DIANA DAWSON ( Mischievously ) That 's what daddy says . p. 75 OLIVER HARDMAN So few husbands and fathers realize like you how much richer the home becomes when there is a great interest in something outside it to talk over . WILLIAM DAWSON Exactly . PETER ROW ( Aside to DAWSON ) Bully for you . WILLIAM DAWSON Rot ! OLIVER HARDMAN ( To DIANA ) Mr. Row 's very enthusiastic about your ability . You must let me help you like your father . ( Looking at watch ) I 'll be late . PETER ROW ( To DAWSON ) Can I make a news item of your going to the city ? WILLIAM DAWSON ( Aside to him ) You do , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plumbing ? WILLIAM DAWSON Damn the plumbing . PETER ROW I hope it is n't as bad as that . BELLE ( Shaking HARDMAN 'S hand as he has turned to say good-by to her and DIANA ) I 'm sorry you must go . OLIVER HARDMAN Trains have no sentiment . p. 76 DIANA DAWSON Thanks for your words to mother . ( Significantly ) They came just when they were needed . OLIVER HARDMAN ( Understanding ) Indeed ? Then I am glad there was a reason for my coming out . One never knows where one 's tiny pebble will ripple , eh ? DIANA DAWSON Show him out , too , daddy . ( Whispers comically ) And , Mr. Hardman , close your eyes when you go through our red plush parlor . OLIVER HARDMAN Good-by , till we all meet together in the city . WILLIAM DAWSON ( In a business-like tone as he goes up to HARDMAN ) Is there any truth in the story that they 're going to remodel the County Court ? Their plumbing 's in a frightful way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he and DAWSON , followed by MRS . DAWSON , go out , leaving door open . PETER starts to follow , when SAM enters down small stairway . There is a pause as the three see one another . ) DIANA DAWSON You 'd better hurry , Peter . He 'll miss his train . PETER ROW Good-morning , Sammy . I see ! Sammy 's going to break the news to his father about Betty , eh ? p. 77 DIANA DAWSON ( Significantly ) Yes . Now . ( SAMMY has flung himself into the chair . ) PETER ROW Hope your father is having a pleasant Sunday . ( PETER goes out . DIANA closes the back doors and comes down quickly to SAM . ) DIANA DAWSON They 'll be right back . Shall I call Betty ? SAM ( Starting up ) What business is it of yours , Diana ? DIANA DAWSON Some of us must be decent to her . She 's married into the blessed family . SAM I get you . You think I 'm a cad . DIANA DAWSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , wait till you get a wife . ( She laughs . ) Oh , you do n't realize what this means to me . DIANA DAWSON Do you ? SAM Yes . I 've got to stay here if father knows . Think of that ! I 'm married and I 've got to be punished in the bargain . DIANA DAWSON And Betty ? SAM ( Selfishly ) What about me ? p. 78 DIANA DAWSON " Dawson &amp; Son " for yours . SAM Not yet a while . I 've got a scheme on that needs me in the city . Oh , you 'd laugh if I told you ; but it will make me a lot of quick money . Father said he 'd carry me for another year . I 'm not going to stay here and give that the slip if I can help it . DIANA DAWSON ( Slowly ) So you wo n't tell dad till that comes off ? SAM ( With determination ) That 's just what I mean . I can fix Betty . I 'm paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I thought dad was . SAM It comes out of my good allowance . All you do is to keep still . I guess Peter Row will hold his tongue if you do , the way it looks . DIANA DAWSON ( Measuring him ) And then you 'll make it all right with Betty ? SAM Have n't I made it all right by marrying her ? All she wants is to be kept . Money will fix most skirts and petticoats and clinging vines like her . And remember you ca n't make me live with her . DIANA DAWSON Sam , you 'd be funny if you were n't so  --  so rotten . ( She goes to the little door of the small stairs and calls ) Betty ! Betty ! p. 79 BETTY HOWE ( Off ) Yes . I 'll be down in a few moments . ( DIANA closes the door . ) SAM ( Going to her nervously ) What 's your game ? DIANA DAWSON You 're fairly good-looking as men go . Dressed in perfect taste , and the ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all borrowed plumage . What have you done to earn it ? Ever done a stroke of honest work ? Ever dug a ditch or added anything more than your debts ? SAM Truck ! DIANA DAWSON You had everything done for you because you were a man . But do you know what you remind me of ? A weak , clinging vine of a woman . SAM ( Insulted ) What ? DIANA DAWSON Yes . A female parasite . Like those who wear diamonds and fine gowns , and who never give back to society the things their grandfathers took from it . You 're like that , only you wear trousers . You say all Betty wants is to be kept . Is n't that all you 're after , too ? The kind of petticoats you say can be fixed with money applies to you , too , Sammy , for like many a rich man 's son you 're wearing petticoats in your soul . SAM What are you giving me ? p. 80 DIANA DAWSON ( Going to him affectionately ) I used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great big brother . Do n't make me look down on you . Do n't ! SAM None of the soft stuff . DIANA DAWSON ( Putting her hands on his shoulders and speaking with great sincerity and emotion ) Betty 's a dear : but she 's weak and not able to fight the world like some of us . For three wonderful years she 's loved you , married you , kept silent , done all she could to meet your wishes . And what have you made of yourself ? ( He listens in spite of himself . ) Should n't love make us all better when it comes ? ( Thinking of PETER ) Even if  --  if it never brings together the people it should  --  even if a girl waits and waits and she finds she must live her life alone : still love should make everything more beautiful , even if it never finds words . ( Pause . ) But you and Betty have each other and  --   --  SAM ( Brutally ) I 'm sick to death of her . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself marrying her . Now you know the truth . DIANA DAWSON ( Astonished ) Sam ! p. 81 SAM Yes . DIANA DAWSON ( Incredulously ) Yet you 've been going to see her right along as though you loved her ? SAM ( Sarcastically ) Well , she 's my wife , is n't she ? DIANA DAWSON ( Recoiling in disgust ) Sam ! ! SAM Now let me handle this . If you do n't , I 'll tell her I do n't love her . See ? I guess you would n't want to be the means of breaking her heart ? DIANA DAWSON ( Gazing at him ) Are you sure you two are married ? SAM Why ? DIANA DAWSON ( Slowly ) I almost wish for Betty 's sake she could find there 'd been some mistake . ( The door opens and BETTY stands there . In the pause she gazes bewildered at SAM . ) BETTY HOWE ( With a certain hysterical strength ) Diana , will you please call your father and mother ? DIANA DAWSON ( Slowly ) Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 82 BETTY HOWE No . Call them . DIANA DAWSON ( Opening the door in back and leaving it open ) Father ! Mother ! Will you come here ? BETTY HOWE ( Crossing to SAM , quickly ) Now tell them , Sam . SAM ( Protesting ) Betty , listen . BETTY HOWE ( Firmly ) Tell them . SAM But  --   --  BETTY HOWE ( In a loud burst of mingled power and pain ) You 've got to tell them , understand ? You 've got to tell them . SAM ( Starting back in astonishment ) Betty ! BETTY HOWE ( Hysterically , as she puts her arms about him so that the others will see as they enter ) I ca n't leave you now . You 've got to tell them . ( DAWSON and MRS . DAWSON enter and see them together . BETTY gives a cry  --  having accomplished her purpose  --  and then sinks back into the chair , hiding her face . DIANA goes sympathetically to her . DAWSON comes down and stares at them in astonishment. ) p. 83 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appealingly ) Father , Sam was afraid of what you might do because he did n't consult you . Betty kept silent as he wished . They 've been married three years . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Astonished ) Married ! ( He sits in the chair and eyes them grimly . ) BELLE ( With a cry , going protestingly to BETTY ) No , no ! BETTY HOWE ( Looking up at her quickly ) Do n't you want it , either ? BELLE ( Confused ) Oh , dear Betty , if I 'd only known . BETTY HOWE You think I 'm no good ? BELLE No , no . But you had no one to talk it over with . Marriage is n't what you think . DIANA DAWSON ( Realizing her words and looking at DAWSON , who has given a quick , questioning glance at MRS . DAWSON ) Mother ! BELLE There , there , Betty ! It took me all of a sudden . p. 84 BETTY HOWE ( Weakly again , her strength gone ) Please do n't let your father be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SAM , who has been standing by the window ) Have n't you anything to say to your father , Sam ? SAM I 'm not feeling very talkative . DIANA DAWSON Father  --   --  ? WILLIAM DAWSON ( Grimly , as they all eye him , after a pause ) Afraid I would n't like it , eh , Sam ? Well , that 's where you 're mistaken . SAM You do n't mean to say you 're pleased ? WILLIAM DAWSON ( Firmly ) That 's exactly what I mean . SAM ( Completely astonished as he sinks into chair ) Oh , good Lord ! WILLIAM DAWSON So I 've been keeping you both , eh ? Well , it 's about time you earn enough to keep her . ( SAM starts to protest . ) A husband has got to support a wife . That 's the law , and it 's right . So I 'm not going to cast you both out . No . I 'm going to be generous and give you the opportunity to support her . p. 85 SAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in town , too . That 's where you stay . You can have your friend Peter Row announce it , Diana . BELLE ( To DAWSON ) And Betty ? WILLIAM DAWSON She 'll come here and stay with her husband , where she belongs . BELLE ( Startled ) Here ? In this house ? WILLIAM DAWSON Yes . Just like you and I did , Belle , when we were married . ( MRS . DAWSON is deeply moved . ) Does that please you , Betty ? BETTY HOWE I do n't care where I live so long as I am taken care of . ( DIANA comforts her . ) WILLIAM DAWSON That 's the good old-fashioned way of looking at it , Betty . I 'm glad to see some of our young women still feel it . So you need n't worry ; it 's all right . You could n't have picked a better girl , Sam . And she can help you , Belle . BELLE ( Not understanding ) Help me ? WILLIAM DAWSON Yes . Seems as though you made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't any objection now that there 'll be somebody here with you to help take care of the house . Diana 's gone and you seem tired of it . Now Betty will make it easier for you . p. 86 BELLE ( Emphatically ) We must n't ask Betty to do that . WILLIAM DAWSON Must n't ? BELLE No ! You must help them some other way . They have the right to start right . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Banging his hand down ) They 'll start the way I say . I 'm paying the bills . Do n't you see what our home influence will do to Sam ? BELLE Do you see what it will do to Betty ? Why , Will , they ought to have a home of their own . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Surprised ) With this big house ? BELLE ( Clearly ) It 's too small for a new family . She ought to have a place of her own , do her own work for Sammy and herself ; not for you and me . Why , Will , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel as though she were a visitor earning her board . Everything she 'd do she 'd feel was because she had to . Everything you gave her she 'd feel was a favor or like taking pay . WILLIAM DAWSON Taking pay ? BETTY HOWE Oh , I do n't care . BELLE ( Emphatically ) But I do . If you really want them to be happy , Will , do n't ask them to come here and live with us. p. 87 WILLIAM DAWSON Is this some more new-fangled ideas ? BELLE ( Almost involuntarily ) No ; it 's only remembering how hard , it was for me  --  when I came here to your father 's house ! WILLIAM DAWSON ( Completely astonished ) Belle ! ! ( He stands , staring at her . ) BETTY HOWE ( Rising ) If I only had money of my own I would n't be this drag . DIANA DAWSON ( To her ) Betty ! BETTY HOWE ( Sobbing , as she goes towards the door ) That 's all it is . I 'm poor-poor-and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as those who own me say . Oh , I do n't care what becomes of me . DIANA DAWSON Betty , dearest Betty ! You 've always got me . Dearest Betty ! ( DIANA puts her arms around BETTY , then looks back at her father and mother , and follows BETTY off , closing the door . ) WILLIAM DAWSON ( Controlling himself ) Sam , leave your mother and me here alone . We 've got something more important than your marriage to talk over . You and Betty live here , understand ? When you can earn enough to support her , you can do as you damn please . Now you go see Perkins and learn something about plumbing . Get out . p. 88 SAM Oh , very well . I was a fool to stay home from church to-day . ( SAM goes out the center door , closing it . They wait till he has gone . Then DAWSON eyes MRS . DAWSON , who has gone to the chair . ) WILLIAM DAWSON Now , Belle , I 'm trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff you 've been talking mean ? BELLE ( Nervously ) Not now , dear . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Firmly ) You said things to Betty just now that seemed mighty pointed at me . BELLE I did n't quite know what I was saying . WILLIAM DAWSON When we 're not watching our words we speak the truth . BELLE I tell you I 'm upset . WILLIAM DAWSON But you were calm enough when Hardman was here talking pictures . BELLE ( Brightening ) That took me back , Will . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Sneering ) To your poverty . BELLE And my hope . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Emphatically ) That 's all it was , hope . Do n't forget that . It 's bad food when you 're starving . p. 89 BELLE We do n't need hope when we are happy . WILLIAM DAWSON But you gave up hope when you married me . ( She smiles tolerantly , in spite of herself . ) I mean your work . BELLE ( Sweetly and not combatively throughout ) I loved you , Will . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAWSON Do n't think human nature has changed because a lot of unmarried males and females are going about saying the home is n't what it was . Why , you never even thought there was anything the matter here till Diana got after you last night . BELLE ( Slowly gaining courage and finding expression ) How do you know what I 've thought ? WILLIAM DAWSON I know you 've been reading that stuff Peter Row writes . That 's enough . BELLE I have had time to read . WILLIAM DAWSON Yet you 'd like to sacrifice that leisure I give you . BELLE ( Shaking her head hopelessly ) You ca n't understand . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Emphatically ) I understand you ca n't wear yourself out at painting and keep me happy . p. 90 BELLE ( Half smiling ) Is that all I must think of ? WILLIAM DAWSON If you 're not willing to do that much , why did you marry me ? ( Walking back . ) Wait till Diana gets a husband , and she 'll see , too . BELLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILLIAM DAWSON ( He stops and then goes to her ) Belle ! BELLE ( Looking up sweetly ) Yes , Will . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Not unkindly ) I 've been a pretty good husband since I brought you here , have n't I ? BELLE ( Taking his hand affectionately ) You 've been good as you saw it . WILLIAM DAWSON All this you 've been saying to-day about going to take up your studying again and Betty 's marriage does n't mean it 's been hard for you , that you 've been unhappy here ? BELLE I 've not ceased to love you , Will . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Testily ) Then what 's the matter with you ? BELLE ( Hopelessly ) Nothing , nothing . p. 91 WILLIAM DAWSON Yes , there is . Why , look how even this room is upset . What have I done ? BELLE Maybe it 's what you have n't done . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Puzzled ) Ca n't you speak so I can understand ? BELLE ( Eyeing him ) That 's what I 'm wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not with me . I have n't changed . But you have . It 's all Diana 's fault . She 's too young to see she 's wrong . BELLE You always think the young are never right . WILLIAM DAWSON Well , do n't you get any of her new-fangled ideas that a girl can go out into the world and not lose something . BELLE ( Quickly defending her ) What has Diana lost ? WILLIAM DAWSON ( Emphatically ) She 's lost her reverence for her home and me ! But she 'll get over it . She 's got her life before her . BELLE ( Goes to him ) Will , have you ever asked yourself what have I got before me ? WILLIAM DAWSON ( Halted ) Eh ? p. 92 BELLE ( Gaining confidence ) Maybe we 'd better try to understand each other . Maybe this talk 's been saving up for years . Will ( Placing her hand on his arm ) , answer me . What have I got before me ? WILLIAM DAWSON You 've got a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want ? BELLE ( With a poignant outburst ) I want something to occupy my life ! ( He looks at her in astonishment . ) I 'm not old or worn out and decrepit . I have my health and strength . I can still do things . Yet what can I do ? With my children no longer needing me . WILLIAM DAWSON But Sammy will be here with you now . BELLE ( Bitterly ) Must I keep on giving to Sammy ? ( He questions . ) Three years of my life , before Diana was born , he had everything . I watched by his side with all my mother 's love , through all his illness as a child , gave up willingly , bit by bit , everything for him , was his slave , as I should be , because he was my baby . And then my love followed him when he grew up and went away . WILLIAM DAWSON I have n't denied you 've been a good mother . p. 93 BELLE Yet I wonder if all the motherhood I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given it to a child on the street with better results . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Incredulously ) Do you know what you 're saying ? BELLE Yes . It struck me all of a heap as he stood there sneering , without an atom of ambition , without a regard for responsibility , without a single day 's work to his credit , and yet taking into his useless life a young girl and expecting her to be happy . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Dismissing it ) Wild oats ! BELLE Which Betty must harvest ! Will , what good was all my mother 's care if it failed to make a man of him ? WILLIAM DAWSON Other mothers I know do n't talk that way . BELLE Maybe they 've thought it , though . WILLIAM DAWSON You ought to be ashamed of yourself . Do you regret having Diana , too ? BELLE ( With love and spirit ) No , no . Do n't you see why she means so much more to me ? She 's like fresh air from the outside world I once thought myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I gave to her . She 's awakened me . She 's what I might have been . She 's made me feel my motherhood was of use . ( Turning aside . ) But I ca n't do any more for her . I 'm fifty . That 's what I 'm thinking of . ( Going slowly to chair and sitting down . ) I 've had my children and they 've left me . And I sit here , empty-handed , and ask myself what am I going to do with the rest of my life ? p. 94 WILLIAM DAWSON ( After a pause ) Are n't you content with me here ? BELLE ( Turning fondly to him ) I would n't like to leave you here alone . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Relieved ) Oh , you 'd like a change of air ? BELLE ( Smiling ) Yes ; we both need it . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Trying to humor her ) I 've been thinking the last few years we might take a little trip somewheres together . BELLE ( Disappointed ) A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through these contracts . BELLE It is n't a trip I want . ( Abruptly , in a business-like fashion ) Will , how much are we worth ? WILLIAM DAWSON ( Completely taken back ) What 's come over you , anyway ? BELLE ( Persistently throughout ) How much money have we ? WILLIAM DAWSON ( Reluctantly throughout ) What has this to do with what you said about Betty and  --   --  p. 95 BELLE You do n't have to stay here like so many other men in business ? WILLIAM DAWSON ( Proudly ) I 'm my own boss . BELLE ( In a kindly spirit ) You never take me into your confidence about money matters , Will . WILLIAM DAWSON The bills are always paid on the third , are n't they ? BELLE ( Beginning to see the humor in his reluctance , but keeping at her intention to find out ) Has n't the house increased in value since the lake shore improvements began ? WILLIAM DAWSON ( Shrewdly ) What do you suppose I went into the company for ? BELLE And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How much is it all ? WILLIAM DAWSON I 've not figured it out . BELLE ( Smiling ) Yes , you have  --  to a penny . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Unwillingly ) Well , I suppose , all told , I 've got about  --   --  ( Unable to do it . ) What 's this got to do with what we 're talking ? p. 96 BELLE I did n't catch the figure , Will . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Reluctantly ) Well , the Trust offered me $75,000 for the business and wanted to pension me with a half-time job in New York . I guess in all there 's $150,000 . BELLE ( Pleased ) We 've that much ? WILLIAM DAWSON ( With a certain pride ) That 's what I 've got . BELLE ( Figuring it out mentally ) That 's six or seven thousand a year income to live on . ( He eyes her suspiciously . ) What are you going to do with it , Will ? WILLIAM DAWSON Why , it all goes to you and the children when I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a certain nave joy ) Will , let 's go live in New York . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Astonished ) What ! BELLE ( Quickly ) Leave Perkins in charge , and let the business run itself . WILLIAM DAWSON Leave the house ? p. 97 BELLE ( Eagerly throughout ) Nellie can manage it . Sam and Betty can stay here alone . Let 's give them the chance , too . You and I can go to the city and live near Diana . ( He gasps in astonishment as she speaks with sweetness and persuasion . ) Do n't keep on making money as though there were nothing else . You 're tired and worn out . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Walking up and down ) Nothing of the sort . BELLE I know better . You need a change from the routine here . You 've worked all your life . WILLIAM DAWSON Nonsense . BELLE Oh , Will , let up a little . We can afford it . Let 's live now . Really live when we are still alive . We 'll soon degenerate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice thing to say about your husband . BELLE We 're wearing the same ruts deeper and deeper , until we wo n't ever be able to get out of them . Let 's make our escape . Let 's spend our money now . I do n't want to wait till you 're dead for it . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Sarcastically ) That 's kind of you . BELLE ( With joyful enthusiasm ) We can get a small apartment near Diana , and we three can go to the theater to hear music and see pictures , and I can take up my studies again in a small way , and then once in a while we can run over with Diana to Paris  --   --  p. 98 WILLIAM DAWSON ( Overwhelmed ) Paris ! BELLE You asked me what it all meant . There 's something inside  --   --  WILLIAM DAWSON You 've got it , too . BELLE Yes ; it 's calling me , a middle-aged woman . Maybe it 's in the air . I do n't know . But I must be near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( He stops , and comes down to her slowly ) Then you do mean you 'd like to leave me ? BELLE ( Sweetly and with hope ) I want to take you with me . WILLIAM DAWSON You know I would n't do any such damn foolishness . BELLE ( Hurt ) You 'd rather have the house own you ? WILLIAM DAWSON Will you tell me what I 'd be doing while you were out all day at the studio , painting ? BELLE ( Surprised ) Why , I 'm not asking you to give up all your interests . WILLIAM DAWSON You 're not ? BELLE ( With consideration and understanding ) I would n't ask of you what you asked of me  --  that would n't be fair . Perhaps you could open that branch office there that you 've always talked of  --  or accept the Trust 's offer . ( He starts away impatiently and she restrains him . ) It will be enough to keep you occupied part of the time with what you like to do , keep us near our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do n't need more money . p. 99 WILLIAM DAWSON ( Bitterly ) And the rest of the time I suppose I 'd be fussing about the flat . BELLE ( Hurt by his attitude and speaking with strength and dignity ) Yet that is exactly what I do every day here without anything else , as you have . I 'm not asking something unreasonable ; only to be with Diana and have a little more life . Think  --  think . I stay here and do what Nellie and another servant could do , because you think that 's a woman 's place . I help wash the dishes , see that the beds are made , the meals ordered , things kept clean  --  the same thing over and over every day . Then I sit down and wait for you to come home tired with making the money we do n't need . And all that necessary work about the house we could afford to pay for . Why , I could make enough money myself , out of my little paper dolls , to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it any way you like : you 're tired of me ; you do n't love me . BELLE ( Moved ) It 's because I love you I 'm trying to make you see . I 'm not forgetting you are the father of my children . But I ca n't keep doing the same things over and over till I die . I ca n't just go on as I have . I 'm lonely , Will , lonely . I want my work again and my daughter more than all else ,  --  my girl to talk to , to be with . p. 100 WILLIAM DAWSON ( Emphatically ) There 's only one way for that . Have her stay here . BELLE And make her sacrifice for me ? WILLIAM DAWSON That 's all there is to it . BELLE No . ( He halts and looks at her , as she speaks kindly but firmly ) I could go to her . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Astonished ) Without me ? BELLE ( Poignantly ) What must I do , Will ? I love you both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you stay with me . BELLE That 's marriage . You said it to Betty , you say it to me . You look at it through the eyes of money . That 's what it all seems to get down to more than love . Money , money , money ! ( With determination ) Well , let 's talk money . If I went to Diana , would you refuse to support me ? WILLIAM DAWSON I have the right to refuse . BELLE Is that the law ? WILLIAM DAWSON Made by sensible men to protect the home . BELLE Then a home must be in a pretty bad way if a man has to tie a woman by his purse strings . Does the law give a wife the right to collect back payments ? p. 101 WILLIAM DAWSON Belle , you 're ridiculous . You talk as if you were my housekeeper and not my wife . BELLE ( With feeling ) If I 'd been your housekeeper at twenty-five dollars a month you 'd owe me three hundred dollars for each of the twenty-five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand dollars ' worth of service that I 've put into this house , which has been my home as well as yours . Yet the law gives you the right to say what I shall do . You can cut me off without a penny if I wish to be with my girl , so long as you obey the law  --  without a penny till you 're dead , because you made the money . Did n't I make money for you by saving it ? Did n't I do the work of an extra servant and gladly do it when we had to save ? If I 'd been your housekeeper and living with you , I could have sued you for that eight thousand dollars . But I 'm not entitled to a penny to go with Diana because I am your wife . WILLIAM DAWSON ( Hardly containing himself ) You 've swallowed a lot of stuff that 's not agreeing with you . You think you 're right because you want to do something wrong . You 're trying to rearrange things that have gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The one who makes the money shall have the say on how it shall be spent . No home is a home without somebody at the head of it , and thank God , I 'm going to be at the head of mine . You 've always accepted the way I saw it , or at least you never said a word till Diana came back . I saw that you had everything and worked myself sick to give it to you . You talk of a salary ! Why , I paid you a dozen times over and  --   --  p. 102 BELLE ( Poignantly topping his words ) And I bore you two children , and my heart 's crying out for Diana . And you wo n't go with me , though you have nothing holding you here , nothing but the past . You 're forgetting I am a mother as well as a wife . ( She starts towards the small stairs . He is halted by her tone . ) WILLIAM DAWSON ( Anxiously ) What are you going to do , Belle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door ) I have n't made up my mind . I 've been saying things I never thought would come to my lips ; yet they all seem as though I 'd said them to myself even before my daughter came back . She has opened the door , but I do n't know whether I must close it again or whether I can go out . I do n't know . ( As she opens the door and starts off , he turns , thrusting his hands in his packets . ) WILLIAM DAWSON Well , what the Hell 's come over women nowadays ? ( MRS . DAWSON has gone off , closing the door . He stands there , puzzled. ) @x DIANA 'S studio : New York City . Late following September . A cheap but pleasant studio up five flights of stairs . At the left is the doorway opening on the stairs , which are indicated outside by the banister . A dumbwaiter beyond this , with ropes visible when the little door is open . In back , at the center , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is indicated to be as simple as possible . Up extreme right is the gas stove , near a sink , which is concealed by a portable screen . Down at the right is an alcove effect , projecting off stage , which is obviously used by DIANA for her work . The clay model of the statue mentioned in the first Act is concealed in this , but is invisible to audience . There is a wire across the opening of alcove , upon which is a pretty curtain attached to rings and easily pulled over . This conceals the statue from those on stage when desired . On the right side of alcove in back long panes of studio glass are seen , reaching obliquely across ceiling and part of main room . At rise of curtain the sunlight pours through these . Upon the walls are some typical sketches and casts . An easel , an unfinished canvas painting , and sculpturing paraphernalia , etc. ; candlesticks , kerosene lamp , etc. ; a long kitchen table , with two chairs near the center of the room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the furnishings . The room , with its feminine touches , should indicate forced economies , but must not suggest poverty . MRS . DAWSON is seated alone , humming before the easel , painting . She seems happy . This continues for some time . She looks off from it critically and shakes her head and then sits for a moment in despair . The buzzer rings and she goes to the dumbwaiter . BELLE ( Calling down shaft ) Hello , is that you , Diana ? What 's the matter ? The keys ? Which ones ? Letters ? Wait a second . ( She gets a letter-box key from her pocketbook , wraps it in paper , and throws it down . ) Look out ! Did you get the butter ? All right . ( She closes the dumbwaiter and comes into the room , stopping a second , thoughtfully . ) Letters ! ( She quickly pulls aside the screen , revealing the gas stove and sink . She begins humming as she fills the kettle , lights the stove , and prepares to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the easel , looks at it , and silently , with a sigh , puts it back in corner . She gets cups and saucers from cupboard , and places them on table . After a pause DIANA comes in , all out of breath. ) p. 104 DIANA DAWSON Phew ! Those stairs ! BELLE Wait till you get your breath . DIANA DAWSON Do n't blame people for not dropping in on us . BELLE ( Cheerfully throughout ) Mr. Hardman says it must be like Heaven  --  splendid when once you arrive . DIANA DAWSON Speaking of Heaven , mother , I 've got seats there for to-night 's summer opera . ( MRS . DAWSON smiles . ) Is n't it funny , the further down you are in pocket , the further up you sit in the theater ? BELLE I think Tannhauser had a ballet in my day . Has it yet ? DIANA DAWSON Same old ballet . BELLE ( Smiling ) I love opera so . It 's such a relief to get away from the housekeeping , too , is n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAWSON ( Laughing ) It 's wasting away . Did the ice come ? BELLE ( Indicating her painting ) Just as I was putting a finishing touch on a Sunset in Summer . " DIANA DAWSON ( Taking butter and going off into alcove ) I 'll save its life . p. 105 BELLE Did you get the letters ? DIANA DAWSON Yes ; one from Peter and  --   --  BELLE Has your father written yet ? DIANA DAWSON ( As she comes in and gives her a letter ) Yes . First time since you 've left home he 's honored us , eh ? BELLE ( Looking at handwriting ) Thought he 'd forgotten how to spell my name . ( Seriously ) After all these months . DIANA DAWSON ( Shaking her playfully ) Open it . BELLE Ca n't I read my love letters my own way ? DIANA DAWSON Why , mother , you 're blushing . BELLE Am I ? DIANA DAWSON ( Puts her arms about her ) You do love him , do n't you ? BELLE I 'm sure I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about all we 're doing , and asking him in every letter to come to us . This must be an answer to the one I wrote day before yesterday . DIANA DAWSON About your going to Paris with me if I won the competition ? p. 106 BELLE Yes . Let 's see what he says . ( Opens it and reads ) " Belle : I am coming to see you . You are as stubborn as I am . " ( She is pleased . ) DIANA DAWSON ( Drily ) It seems to run in the family . ( Fixing tea together and drinking it throughout the following ) Wonder if dad 's coming to eat humble pie ? BELLE ( Smiling ) Where can we order it ? DIANA DAWSON Mother , we ca n't afford pie and Tannhauser all in one evening . BELLE ( Smiling ) We 've had rough sledding , have n't we ? DIANA DAWSON ( Joyfully ) But on our own snow . BELLE I wonder if your father knows I just could n't touch his check ? DIANA DAWSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawer and taking out a legal document ) Every time I need a good laugh I look at the statement he drew up when I came here with you . ( Reading ) " Bill of Service . One wife at $25.00 a month for twenty-five years  --  exclusive of gifts for clothes , food and masculine protection , $7,500 , deposited to Belle Dawson 's credit for whims , foolishness , and Paris . " ( They both laugh heartily. ) p. 107 DIANA DAWSON ( Hugging her ) Mother , you 're another woman . If he goes with you to Paris now , he 'll be committing bigamy . BELLE ( Slyly ) A little experience like that might do your father good . DIANA DAWSON Mother , you 're really not a tiny bit sorry you came with me ? BELLE It 's been a wonderful winter . DIANA DAWSON But you 've missed daddy . BELLE You know I 'm put out at him . I was sorry for him at first . He expected that to bring me back . But now  --   --  DIANA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go back ? Think of it : telling me , his wife , I could only come back if I came for good ! DIANA DAWSON ( Mock seriously ) And you 've gone to the bad . BELLE I 'm going to Paris with you . DIANA DAWSON Suppose I do n't win the competition ? BELLE After you putting your heart in it ? DIANA DAWSON Oh , I do n't dare think of failing . p. 108 BELLE And if you should fail , dear ? ( She goes to DIANA sympathetically , and DIANA pats her hand , understanding . ) We are not all made for success . But you ca n't fail , dearest . DIANA DAWSON Father will gloat so if I do . BELLE ( As they put away the tea things ) Not at all . If you win he probably will puff up and burst with pride . DIANA DAWSON What a funny spectacle ! BELLE ( Abruptly , as DIANA laughs good-naturedly throughout ) The more I think of married men , the more I wonder why God made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like human beings instead of something they own ! They are all alike . DIANA DAWSON All except Peter . BELLE He 's as blind as your father . DIANA DAWSON ( Comically ) Mother , how terrible of you ! BELLE Your father and Peter are both leading their lives without consulting us , yet we 're fastened to them both by our heartstrings . I made a mistake in expecting your father to see . He 's too old and near-sighted . But Peter  --   --  p. 109 DIANA DAWSON Peter understands women . BELLE Yet he has your little heart in his big hand , and has he asked you once what you want him to do with it ? DIANA DAWSON ( Hesitating ) I told you I am an artist , and he feels  --   --  BELLE Nonsense . There 's only one reason he wo n't ask you to marry him . Because he 's too poor to support you . DIANA DAWSON ( Seriously ) He has n't given me the opportunity to share things with him , has he ? BELLE ( Emphatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DIANA DAWSON ( Playfully , astonished ) Mother , I thought I was teaching you . What have I hatched ? BELLE We 're just as bad as the men . DIANA DAWSON I feel worse . BELLE We 'd get more if we women were n't afraid to ask for it . DIANA DAWSON ( With a thought ) You mean we 're afraid to ask a man to marry us if he wo n't speak ? BELLE Yes . We are afraid of grandmother 's blush . ( There is a knock at the door. ) p. 110 DIANA DAWSON Daddy ! BELLE Wait . DIANA DAWSON What for ? BELLE ( Smiling ) Never mind . I was wishing we had that humble pie . ( DIANA opens the door . Mr. HARDMAN , very much out of breath , enters . ) DIANA DAWSON Oh ! Hello , Mr. Hardman . BELLE ( Sweetly ) It 's you , Oliver . Come in . Sit here . OLIVER HARDMAN ( Seated ) I ought to be used to those stairs by now , eh , Belle ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curtain , concealing part of alcove ) If ever you want to find out your real friends , live up five flights of stairs , without an elevator . BELLE Have some tea ? OLIVER HARDMAN No , thanks . ( Referring to curtain ) Diana , you need n't conceal the crime any longer . I know now why you 've always hidden that off every time I came . BELLE ( Eagerly ) There 's been a decision about the statue ? p. 111 OLIVER HARDMAN ( Humorously , delaying to tell them ) So that 's what you were doing  --  when you were n't making little plaster paper-weights to keep the rent down . ( She smiles . ) You knew I was on the Committee ; but did n't want to influence me . DIANA DAWSON ( Eagerly ) I wanted to influence you . Anything to win . BELLE But did she win ? OLIVER HARDMAN ( Enjoying it ) I have two surprises for you , Diana . DIANA DAWSON ( Eagerly ) What 's the other one ? OLIVER HARDMAN You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I 've won ? BELLE ( With great joy throughout ) She 's won ? OLIVER HARDMAN I opened the envelopes last night after the selection had been made and found your name . Your sketch was very elaborate and the model perfect . It 's a wonderful idea and will be even more beautiful when cut in marble . I 'd give a good deal to have even thought it . p. 112 BELLE ( With great joy , and shaking DIANA , who stands staring before her very seriously ) Dearest , you 've won , you 've won ! Oh , my girl , I knew it , I knew it ! DIANA DAWSON ( Dully ) I 've won . BELLE Yes , yes . Think of it . DIANA DAWSON I 've won . I 've won . ( She sinks into chair and murmurs half inaudibly , as she bursts into tears ) Oh , Peter ! BELLE ( Goes to her consolingly ) There , there , dear ; do n't cry like a woman  --  do n't , do n't ! DIANA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cry . OLIVER HARDMAN ( Placing hand on MRS . DAWSON , tenderly ) Let her . BELLE She 's always had such courage , Oliver . But we all need a little success , do n't we ? OLIVER HARDMAN It 's often harder to bear than failure . BELLE But it is success . And she 's done it all herself . DIANA DAWSON It 's you , mother , who helped me make it possible . You . ( Hugging her ) Oh , she 's the dearest mother in the world , is n't she ? p. 113 OLIVER HARDMAN ( Smiling tenderly ) Everybody 's mother is the dearest in the world . BELLE ( Giving a contented sigh ) And now I am satisfied ! DIANA DAWSON ( Going to HARDMAN ) Forgive me for seeming like a foolish girl . We 're all kids , we artists , eh ? Did you ever feel like crying , Mr. Hardman ? OLIVER HARDMAN Yes , Diana ; but it was long ago . DIANA DAWSON Do n't think I am ungrateful . OLIVER HARDMAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head over as he kisses her forehead ) You got it from your mother . BELLE Not everything . It was a man 's faith that helped her . OLIVER HARDMAN ( Cheerfully ) Now comes my second surprise . DIANA DAWSON I ca n't stand much more . OLIVER HARDMAN But first I want to suggest you have the marble cut in Paris . BELLE Paris ? DIANA DAWSON ( Joyfully ) Of course , we 'll go there . Marble 's cheaper . Mother 's dying to go to Paris . p. 114 OLIVER HARDMAN It 's an expensive place to die in , I 'm told . I 've never tried it . I 've a commission for you , Belle , to help you live there . Some interior sketches . DIANA DAWSON ( Joyfully ) So she can be with me ? OLIVER HARDMAN Partly . BELLE You 've been a good friend . ( To DIANA ) But do you want any excess baggage now that you have all that money ? DIANA DAWSON Mother ! BELLE Oliver , we 're both so happy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think I 'd ever again have the courage to ask you what I 'm going to . Will you have the courage to answer me honestly ? OLIVER HARDMAN ( Puzzled ) Why , of course . BELLE ( She goes back to easel and brings down to him the canvas she has been painting ) Look ! You 've seen all the others that I did when I was not painting the paper dolls . Now tell me , honestly , have I gone on any ? ( He hesitates . ) Tell me whether my hands have n't grown too old to get back the skill that lives only by long effort . Has n't the silence of twenty-five years stilled the spark you said was mine ? p. 115 DIANA DAWSON ( Going to her ) Why , mother dear  --   --  BELLE Tell me , Oliver , can I ever be anything more  --  like I might have been ? ( HARDMAN looks at MRS . DAWSON in a friendly , frank way , as though not knowing how to answer her . Then he bows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet smile upon her face . Slowly , but not too sadly , she goes back to the easel , replacing the picture . As she comes back quietly , apparently reconciled , DIANA , who has looked at HARDMAN and caught his sad expression , goes to her mother and embraces her fondly . MRS . DAWSON offers her hand to HARDMAN in a frank , unsentimental fashion . ) Thanks , my good friend ; thanks . You see , I knew soon after I came here . ( Smiling throughout ) I passed it on to Diana , and lost it myself , eh ? Do n't say anything more . I can still do paper dolls , and they please the little children . DIANA DAWSON Mother ! BELLE You 've known it , too , Diana ; have n't you ? DIANA DAWSON I thought you were so happy just trying . BELLE ( Cheerfully throughout ) And being with you . Why , girl , I 'm not sorry or broken-hearted . Have n't I helped my girl by being here ? Ca n't I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Eagerly ) Yes , yes , always . BELLE Think of it , Diana ; think of all it will mean to you : Paris , opportunity , success , and the knowledge you can make beautiful things . I have that knowledge , too : for I have n't failed in my motherhood . You are beautiful  --  all through . I 'm so happy you have what has passed me by , so happy . OLIVER HARDMAN ( Tenderly ) Belle , I 'd give up all my position and reputation to be able to talk like that to a daughter of my own . BELLE ( Looking up and smiling ) You 've missed something , too ? OLIVER HARDMAN A great deal . ( Half whimsically , as he glances at DIANA ) Did you ever notice how everybody in the world is wanting something the other fellow has ? DIANA DAWSON The statue seems so unimportant all of a sudden . BELLE ( Anxiously ) There now . I 've robbed you of the joy of success . DIANA DAWSON No . Only how can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life itself makes ? OLIVER HARDMAN ( Earnestly ) If you feel that , you know the first great secret of success . ( A knock is heard. ) p. 117 BELLE ( Cheerfully ) Your father . He 'll be so happy . OLIVER HARDMAN ( Stopping her ) I 'm afraid he 's grown impatient waiting for me to call him . It 's the other surprise . DIANA DAWSON ( Grasping it ) Peter Row ! OLIVER HARDMAN I wired him the news and said you wanted to see him . Strange how I knew , eh ? ( HARDMAN has opened the door , and PETER stands there , smiling . He enters and closes the door . ) PETER ROW Diana ! DIANA DAWSON ( He stands looking only at her as she takes his hand ) Peter ! BELLE I 'm here , too , Peter . PETER ROW So you are . How are you ? BELLE I 'm bearing the news splendidly . PETER ROW Is n't it fine ? OLIVER HARDMAN ( Recognizing the situation and taking up his hat during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission , Belle . DIANA DAWSON She 'll do it . p. 118 BELLE You wish it , Diana ? DIANA DAWSON Of course , I do . BELLE Then I 'll come around to the office to-morrow for particulars . OLIVER HARDMAN All right . Peter , I wired you to interview Diana for the " Arts and Crafts Monthly . " Remember . That 's all . PETER ROW I 'm a good poker player . I know my limit . OLIVER HARDMAN ( By door , referring to stairs ) It 's so much easier going down . PETER ROW You ought to try sitting on the steps with a harp in your hand . DIANA DAWSON ( To HARDMAN at door as PETER has gone across to MRS . DAWSON ) I 've got a copy of the model in there to exhibit at the Academy . ( Referring to hidden model ) I 'm going to give father one if he 'll destroy the terra-cotta . ( Smiling ) Will you let me make a replica for you ? OLIVER HARDMAN Thanks . I 'll keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will fill a place in my house that 's been long empty . ( HARDMAN goes out , closing door. ) p. 119 PETER ROW You ought to see how mad the town is . You might think a dog bit it . All the old pinheads were sore because a woman won it . They think it 's immodest . DIANA DAWSON ( Laughing ) Wait till they see the statue . BELLE Did you see Mr. Dawson ? PETER ROW He ' phoned me to find out who won the prize . DIANA DAWSON ( Pleased ) He did ? PETER ROW He says he always knew you 'd do it . ( To MRS . DAWSON ) He thinks Diana 's got a mind like a man . BELLE ( Drily ) Could n't he do any better than that ? PETER ROW There 's no reason why , he added , if he supplied the plumbing you should n't supply the art . DIANA DAWSON The family feeling to the end ! BELLE Did he say anything for publication ? PETER ROW He told me to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his compliments . DIANA DAWSON Sounds as though he were thinking over that Paris proposition . p. 120 BELLE ( More interested ) What did he do ? PETER ROW He rang me off . Had to make the B. &amp; ; O. , I 'm told . BELLE ( Looking at her watch ) Yes , he must have been held up on the way . DIANA DAWSON And brother Sammy ? PETER ROW Sam 's been arrested five times for speeding in your father 's new machine . Says it advertises the firm . BELLE Are he and Betty getting along any better ? PETER ROW Yes , he 's away now .  --  Been off some days on a business trip . ( After a pause ) Betty and the baby came on the Pennsylvania with me . ( They both look up , quite astonished . ) Felt like a married man . She found out the train I was leaving on and met me at the station . Says she wanted to see you , MRS . Dawson . That 's all I could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAWSON Where is she ? PETER ROW At the Hotel Mildred  --  round the corner . BELLE ( Putting on her bonnet ) I 'd better go  --  if you do n't mind , Peter . p. 121 PETER ROW ( Smiling ) I 'm bearing the news splendidly . DIANA DAWSON Bring her here , dear . BELLE ( Puzzled ) What could have brought her to the city  --  and with the baby ? ( MRS . DAWSON goes out . DIANA and PETER stand in silence some moments . The late afternoon sun deepens into red during this . ) PETER ROW Well , you 've done it . DIANA DAWSON I simply could n't disappoint you . PETER ROW It would have made no difference in my faith had you failed . DIANA DAWSON You said when I was a success you 'd tell me why you would n't come to the city . PETER ROW Are you sure you have n't guessed ? DIANA DAWSON ( Frankly and honestly throughout , with no coquetry ) A girl likes to have a fellow say it . PETER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DIANA DAWSON Do n't you think she should have some say about that  --  if they 're both honest ? p. 122 PETER ROW You 're going to Paris whether I say it or not . DIANA DAWSON ( Impulsively ) How much does it cost to live in Paris ? PETER ROW For a bachelor ? ( She nods . ) A million a minute . DIANA DAWSON For a married man ? PETER ROW Nothing to speak of . DIANA DAWSON How much would it cost me ? PETER ROW They 'd pay you to go there . DIANA DAWSON Honestly ? PETER ROW No , not honestly . DIANA DAWSON But if I lived in the Latin Quarter with a married man ? PETER ROW Whose married man ? DIANA DAWSON My own . PETER ROW You 've got a husband in sight ? DIANA DAWSON Yes , I 've had my eye on him for some time . Peter , will you go to Paris with me ? PETER ROW To meet your husband ? DIANA DAWSON To be my husband . Will you be my husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's generally done , is it ? DIANA DAWSON It 's the only way I 've ever done it . ( Seriously ) Peter , I mean it . PETER ROW That 's the trouble . DIANA DAWSON You 're not going to refuse me ? PETER ROW ( Taking her hand ) Diana , ever since you were a kid , with your hair hanging down like a bell rope , and I was trying to be comfortable in my first long trousers , you 've meant everything to me . DIANA DAWSON You ought never to have put on those long trousers , Peter . I was lost from that moment . PETER ROW I 've watched you grow up and loved you more every time your hair went higher and your skirts went lower . I saw early you had a great gift . When you 're dead they 'll call it genius . And I made up my mind I could do my little share towards your success by just understanding , and not hindering you . DIANA DAWSON I 've held your hand through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did it all for a reward . I was doing it for you , Diana . You 'll go out into the world now and meet men  --  men who can give you more than a bum reporter on a standpat town paper . Others will give you opportunity  --  and that 's almost as important as having genius . Why , Diana , I 'm not going to stand in the way now . Wait till you 've seen the world a bit , and what it has in store for you , before you talk of marriage . No , no , little Diana of the pinafores , Peter of those first long trousers has got to refuse you . p. 124 DIANA DAWSON ( Who has listened , with a whimsical smile ) Are you through ? PETER ROW ( Smiling ) Are you going to edit my copy ? DIANA DAWSON Peter , you men are so funny . PETER ROW Do I deserve punishment , too ? DIANA DAWSON Yes ; if you 're going to spoil my faith in you when I need it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't need me any longer . DIANA DAWSON It 's what you 've given me that has made me what I am . Why , you are part of me , Peter . Are you going to make me feel I 'm a failure because what I loved failed me ? ( He looks at her questioningly . ) Yes . There must be thousands of women all over the world whose lives would become richer if only there were a man to help or understand ; women to-day breaking through their traditions and inheritances , their cramped surroundings , and reaching out . But they ca n't all do it alone . They need the men to understand and help . Look at mother and how hard father has made it for her . But it 's been easier for me . I 've always felt your hand . It was your words that gave me the courage to live up to what I felt . p. 125 PETER ROW You would have gone on , anyway . DIANA DAWSON Yes , in a fashion ; but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit walked by my side . And now that we 've reached the turning place , I wo n't have you leave me . PETER ROW I will always be there . DIANA DAWSON I want you , Peter . You ! This moment means more to me than  --   --  PETER ROW Than what may come with your work ? DIANA DAWSON Yes . It is here my life and work seem to have met . You mean both . I want both . I 'm throwing aside all my inheritance , forgetting it 's the man who should propose . I 'm asking you to marry me , Peter , because we love each other . I 'm asking my full life with the man I love . And you 're failing me for the first time . ( He looks at her in question . ) You always said marriage would have a better chance for happiness when a man and woman both contributed to the home . But here you face the situation and fail to live up to what you said you believed . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfathers held . You 're not meeting me with the same freedom and honesty I 'm giving you . For you wo n't ask me to marry you , though I can contribute my share now , because you really feel a man should support a woman and you have n't enough money to support me. p. 126 PETER ROW ( Starting to turn away ) You see , no one is quite free from the past . DIANA DAWSON ( Putting her hands on his shoulders and speaking with great frankness and honesty ) I have no feeling that I am pocketing my pride . I 'm honest and glad that I 'm free enough to ask you to marry me . Would n't I have failed you if I 'd been held back by the false feeling which holds you back ? PETER ROW It 's different . DIANA DAWSON ( Withdrawing ) You say that ? You who made me feel you were a man with the same way of looking at life that I have ? ( She hesitates a moment and then , with a quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model of the statue . ) Look ! PETER ROW ( Gazing ) The statue ? DIANA DAWSON Yes . " Democracy . " I got the thought that day when you were by my side . It was the result of all we had talked over . I tried to catch it in marble . A man and a woman marching side by side , step by step . I 've broken away from the old form that made the man lead far ahead with the woman trailing behind . PETER ROW You put them on the same line . p. 127 DIANA DAWSON Both looking far ahead . PETER ROW With hope in their eyes . DIANA DAWSON Yet , as I modeled them both , I felt they were not complete without  --  without  --   --  PETER ROW The child . DIANA DAWSON ( More softly ) See how it 's carried between them . Not the mother alone , but the father , too , holding the little hands as they climb up the incline  --   --  PETER ROW Together . DIANA DAWSON Together . PETER ROW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DIANA DAWSON ( Turning to him with a quiet , earnest intimacy ) Peter , does n't that tell you all my heart is asking ? Shall I be kept from my right to that because you have n't a lot of money when I have enough now to start our lives together ? What right had you to be silent when it concerned my life , too ? Shall you and I waste our years of youth because you would n't speak ? Peter , we belong to each other . I want you . I love you . ( He draws her to him as she looks up eagerly into his eyes . Then he kisses her and still holds her. ) p. 128 PETER ROW ( Comically ) Shall I do your housework for you ? DIANA DAWSON ( Same ) Peter , I love you . PETER ROW Sammy wo n't like my marrying you for your money . ( They kiss . ) What will I do with a bride in Paris ? DIANA DAWSON Forget you 're married . PETER ROW Are you going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So much a week till you finish your novel . Then you can buy me an automobile . PETER ROW Must I write my masterpiece now ? ( She nods . ) I feel more like living it . DIANA DAWSON ( Radiantly ) We will live as well as work , wo n't we , Peter ? PETER ROW Watch me . ( They kiss again . ) ( MRS . DAWSON enters . She sees them and they turn . ) BELLE I missed Betty . I thought she 'd come around here . I 'm not intruding , am I ? DIANA DAWSON No , mother . Peter 's consented to be my husband . p. 129 PETER ROW It 's got past the Ways and Means Committee . BELLE You 're really going to marry my girl ? PETER ROW It will be real enough . BELLE ( Navely ) How did you ever get up the courage to ask her ? ( He coughs . ) You 're not going to ask her to give up her work ? PETER ROW I 've got to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a husband is sufficient excitement for any wife . BELLE ( Going to him and kissing him ) Be good to her . I shall miss her . DIANA DAWSON ( Looking up ) Why , I 'm not going far away from you , dear . BELLE Where is he taking you ? PETER ROW I 'm going to give Paris a treat first . DIANA DAWSON We three , dearest . BELLE We three ? DIANA DAWSON Twenty-five thousand dollars , minus marble , will do it for a while . PETER ROW Say , MRS . Dawson , I 've got a few diamond-studded ideas I can hock to some of the newspaper syndicates . They will pay for the blanc-mange and the tutti-frutti. p. 130 BELLE ( Smiling throughout this and keeping her spirits up ) I ca n't go any further with you , Diana . My part is finished . DIANA DAWSON ( Halted ) Mother ! PETER ROW ( Seriously ) You mean I 'm coming between you two ? DIANA DAWSON No , no ! BELLE I stayed by , waiting till you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd fix it up . You were both so foolish about it . I knew I 'd have to lose you , Diana . I 've gone as far as a mother can go with her girl . DIANA DAWSON Yet it was you who showed me I should ask for it . PETER ROW ( Turning away ) You make me feel like a cradle-snatcher . BELLE It will come to you both , some day . I 've held on longer than most mothers . DIANA DAWSON Dearest , I did n't think it would mean this . BELLE You should not have thought of me , at this time . PETER ROW Mrs. Dawson , wo n't you come along for my sake ? The way she kidnapped me just now I 'm afraid to be alone with her , really I am . She 's going to make me work . p. 131 BELLE Honestly now , the two of you  --  do n't you want to go off by yourselves ? DIANA AND PETER ( Together ) No , no . BELLE Then I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashamed of yourselves . Why , Peter , you 're marrying her , not her family . PETER ROW That is n't customary , is it ? BELLE ( Smiling and trying to keep back her tears ) I 'd be a nice sort of mother tagging around like an old trunk that ought to be placed in the attic . Did n't I tell your father the same thing about Betty and Sammy ? No , young people should start alone . Imagine taking a mother-in-law with you to Paris . ( She goes to DIANA . ) Dearest girl , we older ones can only go so far with the younger , then we must hold our hands out after them as they go on . I fooled myself once into thinking I could always be with you . But I 'm fifty-one . Do n't you see , Diana ? You generally do , no matter how hard it is . DIANA DAWSON ( Realizing it ) Mother , you 're not afraid to let me go with Peter ? BELLE He 's a thief , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay with me every moment till  --   --  p. 132 BELLE ( Losing control of herself for a second , she hugs DIANA quickly ) Every moment  --  every moment till then . ( PETER has gone up in back during this . ) DIANA DAWSON ( After a silence ) And what will you do when I 'm gone ? BELLE I have n't thought it out . DIANA DAWSON You 'll go back to father ? BELLE Go back to him just because you 're going to Peter ? Indeed not . Mr. Hardman says I 'll never be a great painter . I wonder if I might be a Cubist ? ( A timid knock is heard . ) DIANA DAWSON ( Jumping up ) Father ! PETER ROW Timid knock for daddy-in-law . DIANA DAWSON Wait till you hear what he says about my coming marriage . ( She opens the door and BETTY stands there , holding her baby . She seems frailer and is out of breath . ) Betty , dear ! I 'm so glad to see you . Come in ! Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . ( She closes the door , after kissing BETTY and taking the baby. ) p. 133 BELLE ( Going to BETTY and greeting her affectionately as she makes her sit down ) I missed you at the hotel , dear . BETTY HOWE I must have passed you . BELLE Wait till you get your breath . Everybody does . BETTY HOWE May I have a mouthful of water ? It 's so warm . DIANA DAWSON ( Showing baby to PETER , who has come down to her ) Look ! PETER ROW Has n't it grown ? DIANA DAWSON " It " ? Why do men all call a baby " it " ? PETER ROW That 's what I was at the start . DIANA DAWSON She 's a dear . PETER ROW Got Sammy 's mouth . DIANA DAWSON And Betty 's eyes . PETER ROW Your grandfather 's nose . DIANA DAWSON Is n't she beautiful ? She feels so warm and real . ( Offers it to him . He tries to avoid it . ) I want to see if you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to wrestle with it ? p. 134 DIANA DAWSON ( As he takes hold in an embarrassed way ) Not that way . PETER ROW Oh ! I thought I 'd dropped it  --  her . DIANA DAWSON ( Showing him ) This way . ( Stands admiring as he smiles broadly . ) You 're fine , Peter . ( Then she puts her hand seriously on his arm . ) Peter , you know all I 'm thinking ? ( He lowers his eyes as she speaks with an intimacy , while she glances from the baby to him . ) So much greater than marble ! ( MRS . DAWSON has given BETTY the water and then crosses and takes the baby from PETER . ) BELLE ( Sweetly ) What a dear baby ! Let me hold her . DIANA DAWSON Takes you back , eh , mother ? BELLE A great many years . ( MRS . DAWSON has seated herself , holding the baby , as BETTY has risen and DIANA has gone to her affectionately . ) DIANA DAWSON What brought you here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left me . ( DIANA holds her in astonishment . MRS . DAWSON looks up from the child. ) p. 135 PETER ROW You 're mistaken , Betty . Mr. Dawson himself sent word to the " Times " that he 'd sent Sam on business to  --   --  BETTY HOWE ( Interrupting ) He does n't know Sammy 's gone for good . I know . He told me . BELLE ( Half to herself ) I always thought he 'd  --   --  BETTY HOWE Do n't pity me . He did n't love me , and after what he said to me  --  oh , I ca n't repeat it  --  I guess I do n't love him . And here 's our baby . ( Helplessly ) What can I do ? DIANA DAWSON ( Tenderly ) Did you come to us because it was too much for you at home ? BETTY HOWE I do n't know why I came . It was the only thing I could seem to think of doing . MRS . Dawson , you left me there , and it was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's unkind . He seems to understand . He 's fond of the baby , too ( Half smiling ) , though he wishes she were a boy . But I do n't seem to know what to do or how to do it . I can make pretty baby clothes and think of all I 'd like baby to be and love her to death  --   --  . But I do n't know how to take care of her , and I 'm afraid . p. 136 DIANA DAWSON You must n't be afraid , dear . BETTY HOWE Oh , Diana , I 'm not much use and God 's given me a little baby to bring up and I do n't think I can . PETER ROW ( Tenderly ) And you came here because ? BETTY HOWE ( Her face brightening ) I thought perhaps you 'd help me , MRS . Dawson . DIANA DAWSON Mother ? BETTY HOWE Yes . She 's had babies . She might take care of my baby and bring her up so she will be like you , Diana . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROW ( Kindly ) You 're not wishing to shirk your job ? BETTY HOWE Is it my job if I do n't feel I can do it ? I do n't know , only I love my baby so I want her to have every chance and I  --  I ca n't give it . DIANA DAWSON Dearest Betty , you 're all upset . BETTY HOWE I want to do what 's right for baby and  --   --  DIANA DAWSON And mother ? p. 137 BELLE Sh ! BETTY HOWE ( Poignantly ) I know . Who 's to do it ? I ca n't ! PETER ROW ( To BETTY ) And what will you do ? BETTY HOWE I do n't know . I 'm all cried out trying to think . DIANA DAWSON ( Comforting her ) We ca n't think when we cry . PETER ROW ( Kindly ) Betty , come now ; you 're not yourself . You 're not going to give up like this . BETTY HOWE ( As she goes to his arms and he comforts her ) I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly . PETER ROW Can I talk with her alone , Diana ? DIANA DAWSON Yes . In there . ( Indicating back room . ) Shall I ? PETER ROW No , let me . Come , Betty . BETTY HOWE Do n't think I mind Sammy 's leaving me , MRS . Dawson . I do n't . That 's over . ( MRS . DAWSON nods slowly in agreement as she stares before her . ) It would n't be so hard at home now that he 's gone , if only  --   --  p. 138 PETER ROW We 'll talk it all over , come . BETTY HOWE Oh , MRS . Dawson , if you were only there to help me and show me , I think I 'd be happy and  --   --  ( PETER puts his arm about her and they go out into the back room , closing the door . There is a pause . DIANA goes slowly to her mother , kneels beside her , taking her hand , looking at the baby and then at her mother . The room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place where they are . ) BELLE ( Smiling ) I could n't be all I wanted in my work . Then Peter took you , as he should . And now my son 's little baby is reaching out her hands . Maybe the child knows this is what I can do best . She 's such a pretty baby , is n't she ? DIANA DAWSON Dearest ! BELLE ( Calmly and with a sweet resignation ) Yet I 'm happy , Diana . Is n't it strange ? I 'm quiet inside all of a sudden . Maybe , after all , I 'm more a mother than anything else . There 's always some one to take care of the children . DIANA DAWSON ( Looking at the child with a sense of mystery ) To be a mother must be the greatest thing in the world . p. 139 BELLE For some women , yes . But I do n't suppose there 's any law in the world that can make every woman a good mother . We must all remember that in judging Betty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible if you longed for a baby of your own and it did n't come to you ? BELLE ( Looks at her and smiles sweetly as DIANA leans close to her ) I understand , dearest . ( PETER re-enters . ) PETER ROW She 's quieter now . BELLE Perhaps it 's all for the best . DIANA DAWSON ( Rebelliously ) I 'd hate to think a child should be a chain to tie people together when they no longer love each other . BELLE It is n't fair to the child . That 's what I 'm thinking of now  --  since Sammy is what he is . ( Her face brightening . ) Maybe Betty and I together could  --   --  She 'll go back with me ? PETER ROW ( Reluctantly ) That 's all she seems to ask for . BELLE Betty and I always got along . p. 140 DIANA DAWSON You 're going back ? ( There is a sharp , commanding knock on the door . ) BELLE ( Smiling ) That 's your father . DIANA DAWSON You 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped you . ( Looking at child ) I can still be of use now . DIANA DAWSON Mother , I ca n't say anything . BELLE ( Calmly ) There 's nothing to say about life , children . It 's all mixed up . Some of us are further along the road than others . Some of us must stay where we are . You and Peter are far ahead . It 's your strength and not your weakness that is on fire . I shall hold out my hands to you both very often . DIANA DAWSON We shall feel your love as we look back . ( The knock is repeated . ) BELLE Let your father in . Things will be different now . He 'll be as glad I 'm coming back as I am that you and Peter are going on . ( DIANA kisses her mother and goes slowly to the door . PETER has come down by MRS . DAWSON . She looks from the baby and then smiles up into his face . ) She may be another Diana , Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DIANA opens the door and DAWSON stands there . He comes in after a moment. ) p. 141 WILLIAM DAWSON You win , Belle . We 're going to Paris . BELLE ( Smiling sweetly ) You and I are going back home , Will . ( DAWSON stands , silent . There is a faint light from the hallway outside , but the room is full of shadows . MRS . DAWSON , holding the helpless little baby in her arms , is flooded by the moonlight from the windows above. )
