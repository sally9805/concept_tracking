txt It was said that Mr. GLADSTONE could be eloquent about a budget . He allured with facts , he charmed with figures . Hearers found his exposition interesting , entertaining . They came to be bored , perhaps to sleep ; they stayed to look intelligent and think that they understood . Mr. GLADSTONE might have made a romance of the business of our Department of the Interior , it covers so many fields of fruition and endeavor . If FRANKLIN K. LANE is not as deft a magician , his annual report abiOrb 's arid delights . He has imagination , vision , humanity , a style . He is an optimist and a seer . No one understands better the resources of the country and their boundless possibilities . How rich these States are , and how blest their peoples , one does not know until Secretary LANE tells his story and shows how the treasures he passes in review can be conserved . Mr. LANE begins with coal , which will not last forever  --  but there is a water power such as no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . " We live virtually by unanimous consent , " he says , because " let less than one-half of " 1 per cent . of our population quit their " work of digging coal and we are threat " ened with the combined horrors of " pestilence and famine . " And yet : If last year 's coal were used as construction material it would build a wall as huge as the Great Wall of China around every boundary of the United States from Maine to Vancouver , down the Pacific to San Diego and eastward , following the Mexican border and the coast , to Maine again ; and this same coal contains latent power sufficient to lift this same wall 200 miles high in the air , according to one of our greatest engineers , STEINMETZ . But we do not take stock of our yield of coal ; we waste much of it and we do not mine it right . " I feel justified in saying , " observes Mr. LANE , " that the " problem of the strike is not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more about coal than we " know now , and this especially as to the manner in which it is taken from its " bed and brought to our cellars . " He declares that the short year is " a source " of loss to both operator and miner and " is a tax on the consumer . " Seasonal fluctuation in demand is in great measure at fault . Sometimes there is no market ; again car shortage is the trouble ; and Labor can not always be absolved from responsibility . The industry needs stabilizing : " Coal does not " have pressure behind it which forces " it out of the mine and into the coal " yard . It rather must be drawn out by " the suction of demand . And herein " the public must play its part by keep " ing that demand as steady and uniform as possible . " Mr. LANE reaches the conclusion that , unless mining and selling coal is to be an emergency industry , there must be a longer miners ' year and fewer mindrs or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal must go abroad . There is always a great demand for it overseas . With 8 per cent . of the population of the world , we produce 46 per cent . of all the coal consumed . In 100 years our annual production has grown from 100,000 to 700,000,000 tons . An immense amount of coal is wasted . The fuel engineers of the Interior Department discovered a preventable loss of 40,000 tons in one establishment alone . A railroad authority says that " every " fifth shovelful of coal that the " average fireman throws into his fur " nace serves no more useful purpose " than to decorate the atmosphere with " a long black stream of precious soot . " At best one-fifth of all our coal is " wasted . " Universal is the need of conservation . Mr. LANE calls for the harnessing up of American water power to save coal , " the wedding of the stream " and the mine , the white coal ( water ) " with the black . " It is estimated by the Geological Survey that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would yield 54,000,000 continuous horse power . Here is a point brought out by Secretary LANE : Seventy per cent . of the horse power now installed in " prime movers " is east of the Mississippi , but 70 per cent . of the available water power is west of that river , therefore , " unless the East is to lose its in " dustrial supremacy , it must press , and " press hard , for the development of all " water-power possibilities . " With the " age of petroleum " Mr. LANE deals in his suggestive way : " The " 4 oil spring ' which GEORGE WASHINGTON " found in Western Virginia , and by his " last will called to the especial consid " eration of his trustees , was the promise " of a continental . well that last year " yielded 350,000,000 barrels . " The gushing of oil has made possible the automobile , the airplane , the wonderful Diesel engine , high explosives , dyes , medicines . But oil wells fail , and if the precious fluid can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the supply in the United States will not be long deferred . ? " With all the optimism that can be justified , " says Mr. LANE , " I " would urge a policy of saving as to " petroleum that should be rigid in the " extreme . " As burning oil under a boiler to convert water into steam releases but 10 per cent . of the thermal units in the oil , whereas if the same fuel oil were used directly in a Diesel engine from 30 to 35 per cent . of the oil power would be secured , the Secretary recommends that the Diesel type of engine be used by the American merchant marine . " A nation , " he says , " that " could educate 10,000 automobile me " chanics in sixty days might indeed de " velop 1,000 Diesel engineers in a year . " * We are in the petroleum age , " and how long it will last depends upon " our own foresight , inventiveness , and " wisdom . " The United States imported 40,000,000 barrels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationals be encouraged to acquire dl lands in foreign countries , with the understanding that they will be protected in their rights . One of the most impressive passages in the report is that in which Mr. LANE calls for the conservation of the American man , " the most neglected of our resources . " He illustrates : " Twenty-five " per cent . of the 1,600,000 men between " 21 and 31 years of age who were first " drafted into our army could not read " nor write our language , and tens of " thousands could not speak it nor under " stand it . To them the daily paper tell " ing what VON HINDENEURG was doing " was a blur . To them the appeals of " HOOVER came by word of mouth , if at " all . " Americanize these men and all others , women as well as men , who are under the same disability , is Mr. LANE 'S counsel , and vast will be the gain in the nation 's resources .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
