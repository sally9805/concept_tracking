MY first words must be an apology for the title of this paper . It may seem a rather arrogant theme for a professor of Greek to lay before modern readers . But the truth is that I do not for a moment mean to hold up Greek literature as a model for all others to follow . Every great literature has something to teach the others . If ever , in some different life , it were my privilege to address an audience of ancient Greeks , there is nothing I should like better than to suggest to them some qualities which Greek literature might learn from English . But for the present the other side of the question is more fruitful . For some cause or causes , the Greek poets produced extraordinarily successful poetry . I wish now to make a rough attempt to analyze some of those causes and see what we can learn from them . Perhaps it is also rather a stale theme . Many generations of English critics have dealt with it , from Milton to Walter Pater . Matthew Arnold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now made into a school-book , with introduction and notes . Why , then , have I felt justified in treating the subject again ? Because , I would say , though the Classics themselves remain fixed , our conception of them is continually moving . Since the time of , let us say , Matthew Arnold , our actual knowledge has vastly increased . The general widening of our studies , even the pro . cess of turning our focus of attention away from the Classics to more concrete and vivid subjects , has benefited our classical scholarship . It has greatly increased our knowledge , and still more increased our power of imaginative understanding . If any one doubts that , I would ask him to think of three books , the first three that come into my mind : Dittenberger 's Sylloge Inscriptionum , Miss Harrison 's Prolegomena to the Study of Creek Religion , and Mr. Zimmern 's Greek Common . wealth ; to reflect on the vast field covered by those three books , and consider how little of it was known to Matthew Arnold 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not out of disrespect , but out of respect . He is not merely a critic of the first rank , which would be one reason for choosing him , but he is also to an unusual degree fearless and lucid . One knows where to have him , and where to challenge him . I take him as the best type of a liberal , cultivated , and well-read generation , who applied to ancient poetry ? and sometimes to modern : witness his treatment of Shelley ? the somewhat blighting demands of unimpassioned common sense . Let me begin by taking at length one small concrete instance , his attack on Ruskin about the meaning of the words 4mcriZoos He warns us , in the Lectures on Translating Homer , that ' against modern IVIIAT ENGLISH POETRY MAY LEARN FROM GREEK 661 sentiment in its applications to Homer , the translator , if he would feel Homer truly , ? and unless he feels him truly how can he render him truly ? ? can not be too much on his guard . ' ? He then takes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's brothers : ? robs 5 ' On atrextv Overlibos ala . ' So snake she ; but they were already held by Earth the Life-giver , in Lace-demon far away , in their dear native land . ' And he quotes for dispraise , Mr. Ruskin 's comment : ? ' " The poet , " says Mr. Ruskin , " has to speak of the earth in sadness ; but he will not let that sadness affect or change his thought of it . No ; though Castor and Pollux be dead , yet the earth is our mother still ? fruitful , life-giving . " This is a just specimen of that sort of application of modern sentiment to the ancients , against which a student who wishes to feel the ancients truly can not too resolutely defend himself . . . . The reader may feel moved as he reads it ; but it is not the less an example of " le faux " in criticism ; it is false . ' How does Matthew Arnold himself translate qSvcrleoos ? He does not say ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ' merely an ornamental epithet . ' As a matter-of-fact , I think we may safely say that it is an epithet steeped in primitive mysticism . Ruskin 's error was that , not having the clue , he did not go far enough . His feeling about the word was right ; but he stopped short at sentiment , whereas the word really connoted religion . ' The life-giving earth ' is that most ancient goddess who is the cause , not only of the quickening of seeds , but of the resurrection of man . We are familiar with the thought from St. Paul 's use of it as a metaphor . But the conception is far older than St. Paul , and lies in the very roots of Greek religion , as may be seen in Dieterich 's Muttererde . The detailed evidence would , of course , take us too long ; but I may dwell on it thus much . The word cpuo-t , boos occurs only five times in ancient Greek poetry ; twice it is applied to Castor and Pollux , who shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iliad iii , Odyssey xi ) ; once in an indignant speech of Achilles ( Iliad xxi ) it is used of a dead man who seems to have returned , ' with twenty mortal murders in his crown , ' from the grasp of the sburr/Coos aia ; once in an oracle , quoted by Herodotus , of the dead yet ever-living Orestes , who holds the balance of victory between Sparta and her enemies . In the fifth instance ( Hymn to Aphrodite , 125 ) this mystical reference is less clear , and I will not press it . The point may seem small , but it is of shades of meaning like these that the quality of language is formed . This is merely one of the cases in which greater knowledge has widened and deepened our whole conception of Greek poetry , and swept magnificently away some of those limitations which we were taught to regard as Classic . ' Let us now take a few current judgments about Greek poetry and see what we can deduce from them . I will begin with some quotations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Library by Mr. Mackail : ? The Greeks were polytheists ; their religion was local ; almost the only object of all their knowledge , art , and taste was their gods ; and accordingly their productions were , if the expression may be allowed , statuesque , whilst those of the moderns are picturesque . The Greeks reared a structure which , in its parts and as a whole , filled the mind with the calm and elevated impression of perfect beauty and symmetrical proportion . ' 662 WHAT ENGLISH POETRY MAY LEARN FROM GREEK Almost the only object of their knowledge , art , and taste was their gods . ' That is in a sense true , though very misleading ; for we know now that there were at least two stages in Greek religion : first , something more like the religion of other primitive though gifted races , something deep , turbid , formless , and impassioned ; and secondly , an anthropomorphic movement , clarifying , humanizing , and artistic in its spirit , which led to the formation of the beautiful but somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth a little later in the phrase , ' Bacchus , the vinum mundi . ' A Greek Theos is much more adequately conceived as the wine of the world ' than as an anthropomorphic statue . - It is in that sense that we can understand such a line as that of Euripides , We are slaves to Theoi , whatever the Theoi may be . Such Theoi are not anthropomorphic figures ; they are wills or forces . ' Their productions were statuesque . ' Coleridge explains what he means by this . ' They reared a structure which in its parts and as a whole ' made an impression of perfect beauty and symmetrical proportion . ' This criticism seems to me profoundly true , although I should almost have thought that a better word for it was architectural . ' It is borne out in the old contrast between the Gothic church with its profusion of detail , ? always rich , always exciting , sometimes ugly , and constantly irrelevant , ? and the Greek temple , in which every part is severely subordinated to the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the present day : ' The Greeks , except perhaps Homer , seem to have had no way of making their women interesting but by unsexing them , as in the tragiq Medea , Electra , etc . ' Here I think there is little doubt that we have simply moved beyond Coleridge , and thereby come nearer the Greeks . Yet his words are , perhaps , in their literal sense , true . The romantic heroines of Coleridge 's day needed a good deal of unsexing ' before they stood fairlv on their feet as human beings , with real minds and real characters . The romantic fiction of a generation or two ago could never look at its heroines except through a roseate mist of emotion . Greek tragedy saw its women straight ; or , at most , saw them through a mist of religion , not through a mist of gallantry or sentimental romance . When people are accustomed , as Coleridge was , to that atmosphere , it is pitiful to see how chill and raw they feel when they are taken out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole , spends a great deal more study and sympathy upon its women than its men , and I should have thought that , in the ordinary sense of the word , it was hard to speak of Antigone and Deianira and Medea , hard to speak of Andromache and Hecuba in the Troades , or even of Clytemnestra and Electra , as unsexed ' creatures . I will refrain from making quotations from Matthew Arnold on the subject of Greek religion . However tolerant an American literary audience may be , there are limits to the disrespect it will allow toward its great critics . But I must protest , in passing , against his use of the Mime of Theocritus about Gorgo and Praxinoe as an instance of Greek feeling about religion . It is almost as if you took , as an instance of modern religion , one of Mr. Anstey 's Voces Populi describing , say , a church parade . The thing that troubles the ordinary English reader in Greek religion is that he is accustomed to a religion that is essentially moral and essentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Greek religion , in the first place , is not preeminently concerned with morality ; it is concerned with man 's relation to world-forces . In the second place , there is no omnipotent dogma . I will , however , venture to take a sentence or two of Pater 's . In one passage he sums up a discussion by saying that Greek art and literature are characterized by breadth , centrality , blitheness , and repose . ' Now I dare say this is true , if only we understand the words as Pater meant them . But , of course , each word is really a species of shorthand , which summed up for him various long chains of thought . The danger is that we may accept them as catch-words . ' Breadth . ' The word always reminds me of an ancient occasion when I was rehearsing a Greek play , and the stage-manager came forward in a cheery manner to the caste and said , ' Now , ladies and gentlemen , remember this is classical . Breadth ! Breadth ! No particular attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was interpreting Pater rightly . ' Centrality . ' This seems true ; at least the Greek poets have a clear normal tradition of style . They do not strike one as eccentric or cliquey . But we must remember that they are largely central just because other artists and poets have gathered round them . They stood where they happened to be , and it is the rest of us that have made a centre of them . ' Blitheness . ' Well , their best work on the whole lies in tragedies and dirges . I have tried hard to understand what the critics mean by the blitheness ' of the Greeks . It perhaps means what I think would be quite true , that the Greeks have , on the whole , an intense sense of life , of the beauty of things beautiful , of the joyousness of things Joyous , as well as of the solemnity or tragedy or horror of other things . Greek poetry in classical times is certainly hardly ever depressed or flat or flabby . ' Repose . ' Yes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every great impassioned poem , ends upon a note of calm ; and we all know the same quality in the paintings and statues . Pater again makes great use of the word ' statuesque , ' and it is a word that I can never feel quite happy about . Stone , of which statues are made , has certain obvious qualities : it is cold , hard , immovable . Speech , of which literature is made , has its qualities also , and they are remarkably unlike those of stone . Speech is warm , swift , vibrating , transitory . The ' statuesque ' theory is derived , I believe , from Winckelmann , who was very intimate with the statues and knew little of the literature ; consequently he interpreted everything through the statues . And every dilettante is under the temptation of following him , since a decent acquaintance with the statues is an easy thing to acquire , and any first-hand acquaintance with the literature a hard one . We should also remember that the statues which Winckelmann and the critics of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greece , were almost without exception the work of the decadence , and to our present judgment markedly unlike the spirit of the great period . II Now , what result emerges from this rather rough summary ? First , that Greek poetry is full of religion . This is true and important , though religion , as we noticed , is not exactly what we mean by the word : classical Greek poetry is somehow always in relation to great world-forces . Every great 664 WHAT ENGLISH POETRY MAY LEARN FROM GREEK vicissitude , every desire and emotion , seems to be referred to the mysterious action of tremendous and inscrutable laws or wills ? something that a Greek would call Theos . Secondly , it is full of this statuesque , or , as I prefer to call it , ' architectural ' quality . Every work of Greek art is ' a structure , which , in its parts and as a whole , aims at an impression of beauty and symmetrical proportion . ' This is a principle of which the Greeks themselves were eminently conscious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedy should be eihnivorrov , ' capable of being seen as a whole ' ; and the writers on style , from Terpander and Gorgias down to the later rhetoricians , are never weary of telling us that a speech or poem must have ' a beginning , a middle , and an end . ' We may perhaps think that we knew that before ; but if we compare the Iliad or Odyssey with any of our English epics or long poems we can hardly help feeling an astonishing difference in this point of architecture . The Iliad and Odyssey are definitely constructed ' ; they have a beginning , a middle , and an end . They have a story working up , through a great series of climaxes and digressions , to a tremendous height of emotion just before the end , and in the actual end reaching a note of calm . Turn them into English prose , and they still make thoroughly good stories . Now think of our epics , the Faerie Queene , the Excursion , the Revolt of Islam , Endymion : are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this quality of the ordered whole ? I can not help thinking that this is the real cause of the failure of the long poem in English . A poet should always remember that poetry excels prose threefold and fourfold in sheer boring power ; and yet our poets never seem to have grasped the importance of making a long poem organic in its parts , as they would a prose story . Even Paradise Lost is not from this point of view well-constructed . It may be that the future here has something great in store for us . In this matter of construction we have learned our craft on the short story , and brought it to a degree of perfection perhaps never equaled in the world . It seems now as if we were able to grapple with the long prose story . After that , perhaps , will come the turn of the long poem . Of course it is not the same quality of construction that is wanted . The amount of sheer excitement and intellectual interest which is needed to float a long prose story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention from its higher poetic qualities . But there is an organic construction for a poem , too ; and that , I believe , is one of the obvious tasks that lie before us . Religion ; architecture ; there is also , I think , a third quality , which critics have not noticed , or have treated as obvious . I mean the quality and precision of the texture out of which Greek poetry is woven . It is not merely that the actual words are finer in quality than English words , though I incline to think that this is true also . They build their palace of cedar , and we of rougher wood . But still more important is the actual precision of the building , the exact fitting of word into word with reference both to the emphasis and the rhythm . This depends greatly on the importance of quantity in Greek speech . To take one instance : it is in the essence of Greek poetry that a long unstressed syllable shall nevertheless be felt as long . That is a rock on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some caution is necessary here . I am assuming , it may be said , permission . WHAT ENGLISH POETRY MAY LEARN FROM GREEK 665 a careful and studied pronunciation , which is really characteristic of Greek as a dead language spoken by scholars , just as it is of Latin for the same reason , jus but which probably never belonged to any language in the rough-and-tumble of common intercourse . Well , I can not stop to debate the point at length , but I think that , first , the detailed rules of Greek metre and the laws which the poets followed , and , secondly , the definite statements of grammarians of the best period , show that , in poetry and public speech at any rate , the Greeks did demand , and intensely enjoy , a very clear and accurate articulation . In the time of Philostratus , people came in thousands to hear a sophist who could really pronounce the old poetry with full attention to quantity , to stress , and to that curious variety of musical tone which in post-classical times became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the musical accent into a stress-accent , as is often done in America and Germany , is to my ear absolutely destructive of all poetic rhythm . It is better to attend only to quantity and neglect the pitch-accent altogether . But the question is highly technical , and I will not discuss it further . Let us go to Matthew Arnold again . ' Homer , ' he says , ' is rapid in movement , plain in style , simple in ideas , noble in manner . ' Ies ; but what I think strikes me still more is the combined gorgeousness and precision of the texture . Put it against the beginning of Pope : Yes , it is rapid , plain , dignified , and full of fire ; but will it stand for a moment in point of texture and quality beside that . Try even Milton : deleted material That is much nearer : it is gorgeous and it is precise , only it has not quite the simplicity ; it has nothing near the musical swing . It can not , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of course , full value to the long unstressed syllables . It is only by training that we are able to do this in the Greek hexameter , to say avSpay ip ? Sow , andran he're3an , without letting some two of the five long syllables go short , or to pronounce Pallas Athens rightly , and not as if it were ' Pans Atheeny . ' Our poets , of course , have tried the hexameter , fascinated by that swing . I abstain from criticizing Longfellow , partly from prudence , partly from affection ; but I take two passages that are selected for their merit in Ward 's English Poets , and must ask my reader to read them carefully aloud , comparing them all the time with some one line of Homer . 666 WHAT ENGLISH POETRY MAY LEARN FROM GREEK Now , what is wrong with the first of these passages is pretty obvious . It is that , on any standard approaching that of the Greeks , the metre is beneath criticism . The stress on ' but , ' the utterly lamentable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ' most of ' and ' boiling ' have to count as two long syllables , while ' pure , a ' is apparently a dactyl . The poet , in fact , is completely baffled by the most obvious technical difficulties of the metre he has chosen . This is not , of course , to deny the beauty of many lines and passages , and the interesting character of the poem as a whole . The passage from Kingsley is metrically ever so much better . The chief flaw is monotony , mainly at the beginning and end . The difficulty of starting on a stressed syllable drives the poet to monotonous construction ? witness the four lines running beginning with a present participle ? and there is almost as much monotony in the constant dissyllabic endings . There is no approach to that perfect control of the instrument which enables Homer ? and Virgil even more ? to vary their rhythms and pauses without ever spoiling the metrical structure . The stressed syllable at the start and the dissyllabic ending ; those are two great difficulties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , as well by his wonderful skill in other respects , that Swinburne has contrived to build up in English a trisyllabie metre that will really stand alongside the Greek . The English will bear the comparison . The great difficulty is that such texture of language in English is somehow exotic ; it has to choose its language and diction with special exclusiveness . It hardly ever , even in Mr. Swinburne 's sea-poems , seems really to belong to the wind and the open air . The strong direct life of the Homeric hexameter comes out more in Sigurd the Volsung : WHAT ENGLISH POETRY MAY LEARN FROM GREEK 667 ' It is fine poetry , strong and beautiful . I hardly like to say anything against it ; but taken as mere metrical workmanship , it remains rough . The texture of the language is sometimes cheap , sometimes a little affected ; the long unstressed syllable , on which everything depends , is little considered . The texture of Sigurd seems to me sometimes to be founded not upon Homer but , as it were , upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it in your cars , think first of Swinborne , then of the words spoken to the dead Achilles in Odyssey xxiv , how all day long down to even-fall the bravest of Achmans and Trojans met their death , ? The Swinbttrne had one quality of great poetry , and the Morris another , but has not this , almost to the limit of perfection , both ? It is so smooth and splendid , and at the same time so simple and strong ! III In illustrating this question of poetic texture , I find I have been speaking chiefly of epic . Is there any future for this form of poem in English ? Most people will say that they do not see any clear hope ; but we must remember that such negative evidence is not of much value . As soon as somebody can see the thing he will do it . As we said before , it is chiefly architecture that is wanted . The texture , indeed , may need generations of craftsmen to bad it up , but we must remember that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The other great quality , religion , is wanted , too . Probably a great epic should be based on some traditional story with characters and incidents that already mean something in the national mind . At any rate it must be somehow related to life as a whole , or to the main issues and interests that men feel in their lives . It is something of this sort that makes much of the greatness of Mr. Hardy 's Dynasts . If one could only get some day a combination of the sustained sweep of Frank Norris with the high quality of William Vaughn Moody ! About drama I will say nothing at present , or almost nothing . The three qualities we have noticed , religion , architecture , and beauty of texture , are notably present in Greek tragedy ; the religion most obviously so . As to architecture , whatever may have happened to the supposed classical unities , it is the rarest thing in the world to get a Greek drama which does not aim essentially at unity of effect and unity of atmosphere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholars enjoy Greek tragedy as much as they enjoy Homer , say , or Theocritus , is that drama so seldom condescends to burst out into specially beautiful scenes or passages . Every character and every scene is subordinate . Each is doing work for the whole . It is largely the same quality , I think , which in modern times leads to the comparative unpopularity of Ibsen with lovers of literature . Of course I do not compare him with the Greeks in his actual attainment of beauty ; but in his resolute disregard for the beauty of the part , and his concentration on the value of the whole , he works exactly in their spirit . But how , you may say , does this comparative disregard of beautiful or eloquent language fit with my doctrine of texture ? It does so in quite an interesting way . Let us spend a moment in considering it . The diction of a poetical play in any language has , I conceive , two tasks , 668 WHAT ENGLISH POETRY among others , laid upon it . It must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tension , the lower end tending toward ordinary conversation ( or the illusion of ordinary conversation ) , the upper end toward sheer lyrical poetry . And secondly , it must somehow preserve always a certain poetical quality of atmosphere ? something ideal , or high , or remote , however one may define it . Now you will find that the ordinary English poetical play tries to solve this problem by ( 1 ) rather slack and formless metre ; and ( 2 ) ornate , involved , and ultra-poetical diction . The first enables the poet to slide into prose when asking for his boots ; the second , almost unassisted , has to keep up the poetical quality of the atmosphere . It does so , of course , at the expense of directness , and often with the ruinous result that where you have Drama you have killed Poetry , and where you have Poetry you have killed Drama . Greek tragedy tried quite a different method . It has ( 1 ) a clear ringing and formal metre , based indeed on the rhythm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmistakable to the ear . Comedy and Tragedy both write their dialogue in iambic trimeters , but the critics tell us that if in comic dialogue any line occurs which observes the metrical rules of tragedy , that line is a parody . So clear is the tragic rhythm . ( 2 ) This metrical system , aided by a corresponding convention in vocabulary , so maintains the poetic atmosphere , that the language can afford to be extraordinarily direct and simple , though , of course , it can also rise to great heights of imaginative or emotional expression . I may mention that these two points constitute part of the reason why , after many experiments in blank verse , I came to the conclusion that the tragic trimeter was best represented in Eng- MAY LEARN FROM GREEK lish by rhyme . Rhyme gives to the verses the formal and ringing quality , remote from prose , which seems to my ear to be needed ; it enables one to move swiftly , like the Greek , and to write often in couplets and antitheses , like the Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would English convention tolerate for long the perfect simplicity of language that is natural in Greek , it was possible in rhyme to write far more directly and simply than in blank verse . Blank verse , having very little metrical ornament , has to rely for its effect on rich and elaborate language . Rhyme often enables you to write lines as plain and direct as prose without violating the poetical atmosphere . That is a digression , and my judgment may , of course , be wrong . But I believe you will find that one reward which Greek tragedy reaps from its severe metrical rules is that , the ear being satisfied and unconsciously thrilled by the metre , the language can at will cast away all ornament , and go straight for drama . In the greater part ' of the CEdipus Rex you will find scarcely any deliberate eloquence , and scarcely any poetical ornament . What you do find in every speech and every line is dramatic relevancy . There is beauty , of course , but not as it were a beauty that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beauty that necessarily results from clean well-balanced proportion , psychological truth , and intensity of feeling . It is in lyric poetry that the difference between Greek and English , and , I will venture to say , the great technical superiority of Greek , comes out most strongly . I am considering , of course , so far as the two can be separated , technique , and not inspiration . I am not for the moment concerned to deny that for sheer poetic beauty some quite simple English song , with no elabora- WHAT ENGLISH POETRY MAY LEARN FROM GREEK 669 ton or subtlety about it , may stand as high as the choruses of the Agamemnon . I merely urge that in point of technique there is hardly any comparison . It is only in the last century that English poetry has begun to learn its business in the writing of lyrics , under the lead first of Shelley , and then of Swinburne . Some admirers of Elizabethan lyrics will , perhaps , here rise in indignation against me , but I must still maintain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabethan song is absolutely rudimentary . I will base that statement on three grounds : 1 . Elizabethan song can not handle the trisyllabic foot . No English poet succeeded in doing so till the generation of Shelley . 2 . No Elizabethan song can handle what the Greeks called syncope ? that is. the omission of a short unstressed syllable , so that the long syllable that is left becomes over-long ( as in ' Break , break , break . ' ) 3 . No Elizabethan song can make anything of the unstressed long syllable . 4 . These are three purely metrical points , but I would add another of wider range . The whole essence of lyric is rhythm . It is the weaving of words into a song-pattern , so that the mere arrangement of the syllables produces a kind of dancing joy . Now , the older English lyric seems to associate this kind of marked rhythm with triviality . It has no feeling for the sublimity of song as such . Even at the present day our clearest lyrical measures are almost confined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriousness to be incompatible with good lyric rhythm . Now Greek lyric is derived directly from the religious dance ; that is , not merely the pattering of the feet , but the yearning movement of the whole body , the ulti mate expression of emotion that can not be pressed into articulate speech , compact of intense rhythm and intense feeling . The two are not in Greek incompatible ; on the contrary , they are intimately and essentially connected . This rhythmical movement of the body accompanying the lyric leads naturally to an extreme precision in metrical values , a full valuing of each word . The long unstressed syllable comes by its due ; trisyllabic and even quadrasyllabic feet like the Ionic a Maiore ( " - rnorituri ' ; ' in a palm tree ' ) are easily managed ; and syncope , which we find so difficult , is almost a central and necessary feature . It is curious to think how difficult it is for us to work words together into one of the commonest of Greek song-metres . What we do is to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very clear stress on the last syllable of some member of the song , to make up for the rather blurred values in other places . Again , in lyric also we find the architectural quality . A good Greek lyric always builds up to the rhythm of its final lines . To quote instances would take us too long , as each one would have to be proved in detail . But let any one read the last two or three lines of each verse of the Fourth Pythian , and see how the rhythm is deliberately at certain chosen places entangled and checked , in order to run loose at the end in smooth trochees , with just the thrill of one resolved arsis . Almost any of the more serious lyrics of Euripides will show the same process . Let me illustrate this point of architecture in English . Take a good Elizabethan song , ? I tremble here at what I am going to say , but my convictions will out , ? an Elizabethan song , in 670 WHAT ENGLISH POETRY which a short line is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no architecture . There is no lyric value in the shortness of that line . The ear has not been led up by a series of rhythms to demand that particular short line , and to feel a special rest and refreshment when it comes . You will tell me that it was meant to be accompanied by music , and that by working the music right you can make the two-beat line seem as if it had four beats . Quite true , but no defence : admit modern music , and all thoughts of metre and poetic rhythm go to the wall . Modern music would justify the first column of the New York Sun as a lyric . Now take a poem that is architectural : If you read this carefully , a little dreamily , letting your speech move somewhat in the direction of song ; you will find that the short lines , especially at the end , are deliberately built up to . That is what makes them serve their rhythmical purpose . They give just the rhythm that the ear has been made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this subject , but I have perhaps already indicated the main point , and I would MAY LEARN FROM GREEK like now to call attention to one par . titular misunderstanding . Professed imitations of Greekrhythin in English poetry seem to me to have gone practically always on quite wrong lines . They ought to have been more intensely rhythmical than the average ; as a matter of fact , they think they are being Greek when they lose lyrical rhythm altogether . Swinburne , as usual , so far as metre is concerned , gets triumphantlyto the heart of the matter : That has a strong clear rhythm , full of majesty and sweetness , and it happens to be practically a Greek metre : ? But if you take , let us say , the most admired lyrics in Samson Agonistes : ? This may be poetry of the highest order ; I can quite imagine that those who know it by heart even enjoy the rhythm of it . But surely it is clear that the rhythm is exceedingly obscure , and utterly unlyrical in quality ? There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Milton 's average blank verse . WHAT ENGLISH POETRY MAY LEARN FROM GREEK 671 The beginning of the second passage is , I believe , meant to represent choriambies : ? hut they can not be considered successful choriambics . All writers of lyrics is English must face a disagreeable fact . When there is a perfectly clear and simple metre to give guidance , their readers will very likely , though not certainly , pronounce the words right ; but the words themselves , however carefully chosen , will hardly ever guide the average reader through a difficult or original metre . It is a habit of our pronunciation to make the word-accent yield constantly to the sentence-a event : and if you try in lyric to impose on the reader some rhythm to which he is not accustomed ; if you try to produce some rhythm that you think rare and beautiful , or particularly expressive of some phase of feeling , you must prepare for disappointment . Unless you write in words of quite unmistakable rhythm ( I recommend mulligatawny ' and ' hullabaloo ' ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twist your line away toward some rhythm with which they are thoroughly familiar . This is one reason among many why these unrhymed quasi-Greek metres are so certain to fail of their purpose . Take another case , from Matthew Arnold 's Merope : Now I do not say that the thought of these verses is unpoetic or dull , or that the expression is particularly bad ; but I must say that the verses seem to me , as lyrics , to have absolutely no value at all . Put them for a moment beside the ' Forsaken Merman , ' or Strew on her roses , roses , ' and see how , not only are there no metrical refinements , no polysyllabic feet , no syncope , no unstressed long syllables , but there is no trace of the first necessity of lyric ? the rudimentary swing that urges you in the direction of singing . Let us turn from that song to what I conjecture to have been its original model , a chorus in the Choephoroi : ? Read this with its full metrical values , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its rhythm intensified by some kind of movement or stress of the body ; then notice how all through the stanza your voice starts and is checked and is checked again , and then floods out in a ringing line . You will see that this solemn poem has a rhythm so marked that in modern England we should only think it fit for a music-hall ; and secondly , that it is full of metrical architecture . What a feeling of peace comes to the ear at the recurrence of the metrical phrase of the last line ! In general , I believe that in the last generation or two we have been gradually getting to understand Greek metres , ? though , of course , we do not understand them fully yet , ? and , at the same time , English poetry , especially that of Shelley and Swinburne and their followers , has been developing its own lyrical genius . We are now , for 672 WHAT ENGLISH POETRY MAY LEARN FROM GREEK instance , able to handle four-syllable feet as well as three-syllable . Compare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Break , break , break , ' onward through various beautiful Christy Minstrel songs like and so getting back to lines like the clue to which is that the ' I of the second 18aia is equal to ? ? or ? " : ? Also several writers of lyric since Swinburne have observed their unstressed long syllables . Just at the moment , it may be , we are in the midst of a reaction against metrical accuracy , and many of our best writers pursue an effect like that which the Greeks found in the scazon and similar freaks of verse , a deliberate disappointment to the ear , producing some feeling of pathos or frailty . Personally , I think it is overdone , but the fact that good writers do it probably shows that they have at least an ear for accurate rhythm , and could produce it if they were not , for the moment , tired of it . IV I have spoken much about texture and much about architecture ; I have said little of the other of my three points ? the constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some any emphasis laid on this point may seem almost paradoxical . To them , perhaps , Greek religion is a thing of anthropomorphism and lucidity ; a thing essentially without mystery , and almost without earnestness . I would ask them to remember the background ; to remember the evidence of anthropology and even of Greek religious inscriptions , and to realize that older religion which vibrates at the root of Greek poetry . The lucidity of the fifth and fourth centuries was imposed on a primitive tangle of desires and terrors , on a constant sense of the impending presence of inscrutable world-forces . Greek poetry is never far removed from the primitive religious dance . Some particular lyric may stand , perhaps , half-way between an original magic dance meant to bring rain and fill the water-springs , and a Mere artistic dance meant to show its own gracefulness . But , at any rate , there is always about it some trace of the first , and through the beautiful words and graceful movements of the chorus one feels the crying of a parched land for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desires . . In our art it is true , doubtless , that they are the ministers of love% in Greek they are as a whole the ministers of this religion , and this is what in a curious degree makes Greek poetry matter , makes it all relevant . There is a sense in each song of a relation to the whole of things , and it was apt to be expressed with the whole body , or , one may say , the whole being . It sometimes seems as if , for poetry , we have become too much differentiated . Poetry needs intellect , of course , and rots without it . But poetry also needs the whole self in one piece : every thought in it needs the support of a sub-conscious and instinctive emotion . With us , when inspiration comes , the ruling powers of the brain are apt to dance their Bacchic dances alone ; in classic Greek one feels that the underground inarticulate impulses moved more along with them , as they did with Euripides ' Bacchanals , when deleted material It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again at this oneness ; it may be that it depends on the actual quality of the daily life we live , and that to the Greeks of the Great Age , not for long , but for a few glorious generations , the daily stuff of life was really a thing of splendor . If so , our task in the matter of poetry is wider , and perhaps harder , than we thought ; but it is a task to which voices on every side are calling us.
