WE had stopped short , for It was the part of pru-. ; dence to see whether s the bottom of our car would clear the rushiony roll of wild grass ridging the middle of the trail . The engine , meanwhile , continued to throb , dripping grease , as if in a great sweat over the immense labor of lurching us up so many steep hills , along this bad road which the Indians call the Devil 's Wash-board . Our fellow-passenger , the newspaper photographer , had from the first regarded our project with gloomy mistrust . Everything would go wrong ; he knew it . He had been up in this Indian country before , and his experience of that time he expressed with the one word , " Rotten ! " Frequently he reiterated his chief complaint : " They wo n't stand for having a lens pointed at them , these Injuns ! " Our destination lay far distant from a railroad . We were on our way to attend the first agricultural Fair ever held by the Omaha Indians . Naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these aborigines of Nebraska should have undertaken such a project . How , in a single generation , had it been possible for the dust of primitive life to be shaken so completely from their moccasined feet ? I remember that as a boy I had heard nothing but disparagement of the Indians . They would never amount to anything . They were too lazy to farm . What a pity that good , rich land should have been set aside for them ! They were only being pauperized by the government . So people said . But here , to-day , among hazy green hills , rich in their standing grain , what must one think of these opulent corn-fields reaching farther than eve could see ? At intervals we had been passing comfortable farmhouses , with outbuildings , machineCXXXIII ? No. 79a. - 15sheds , cribs , spacious barns . Glass balls on the lightning-rods , glittered in the clear sun like sparks of silver fire . You would never suppose these to be the country places of Omaha Indians , if each home had not had beside it another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the top . " That 's what they 're like , " said Pat , when we had halted to take a photograph . " I do n't care what kind of a house they have , they must always stick up a tent , these Injuns . They cling to all kinds of tribal nonsense . They 're great on visions . Nothing pleases an Injun so much as to peel off a vision with as many layers to it as an onion . And to help them with their visions they have a bitter drink brewed from little red beans that look like cranberries and are called mascal . Plenty of kick to it , that beverage . " Pausing to light a cigarette , Pat went on : " Maybe you think Injuns are stolid and do n't talk much ; well , sir , just wait till they 've got some visions worked up , and then see ! Talk ? Oh . no ! Why , they go gab-gab-gabbing all night long . " While Pat fared forth with his camera I looked with interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm-house . Wise red man , I reflected , to retain the lodge of his ancestors . It is his sleeping-porch ; clear sunshine and clean air , blessings of Wakanda. still come to him there My opinion as to the Indians ' good sense I expressed aloud , when the photographer , wading more than knee-deep in the wild prairie grass , had come back with his camera . But his opinion of my opinion he expressed by a derogatory snort . He knew them , these Injuns ! Only see what had happened to a pioneer uncle of his who had settled in Dakota . Coming home one day from a hunting trip , that frontiersman had found his cabin reduced to a charred mass of smoking ruins ; yes , and his wife and the twins lay dead . " He was provoked about it , " said Pat . " My uncle was so provoked that he moved right out of that country . " We did not discuss the wisdom of Pat 's provoked uncle , for our attention had been absorbed by what we saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From a lofty crest of the trail we were looking down into that verdant bowl , where snowy flecks , gleaming white in the sun , outlined a circle ; they were tepees of the Omaha Indians . For many miles the native families had been assembling there , to make that their camping-ground , while they held this , the first of their agricultural fairs . Arriving presently among those tribal tents , we found that modernity and the old ahoriginal life had curiously linked hands . A foretaste of what it would be like we had already received on the way ; for our car had passed a group of Indians , veteran members of the tribe , each of them blanket-draped , his hair in braids and gold circlets in his ears . They were driving a smooth-running limousine . Yes , indeed , they knew the uses of the automobile , and yet there was one among them ? the white-haired member of the party ? who was said to have been expert , in the old days , with the bow and arrow . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region where now he was luxuriously speeding along in that six-cylinder motor-car ! When we fell into conversation with him and made occasion , later on , to complain of the mud-holes we had slushed through and the decrepit bridges we had crossed , he said , with deliberate emphasis : " Our county commissioners are white men . They always promise better roads . On their lips they say it , but in their hearts they are ? white men . " As we drew up in the central space of the fair-ground , we saw much to recall what Indian life must have been when this same hollow among the hills first became the site of an Omaha village , as long ago as 1855 . The earthen lodges , to be sure , had disappeared , no one could tell us when ; but here were tepees still adorned with tribal symbols ; loose ponies grazed in scattered groups ; sliced beef , hung upon poles , was drying in the sun ; brown-faced children were quietly romping ; and the pleasant , wild aroma of camp-fires everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , resinous smell of sunflowers ; for an enormous yellow field of them had been cut down and cleared away to make room for the race-track . Intermittently , from the direction of the live-stock pens , you heard now the lowing of a prize cow , now the plaintive bawling of a calf , and sometimes the squealing distress of little white pigs being unloaded from an exhibitor 's wagon . Presently people were seized with a . ommon impulse to close in about three automobiles that had come whirring , into the fair-grounds . The musicians had arrived . It was the Indian band , a concert organization brought here all the way from Pipestone , Minnesota , and the flash of the sun on the bright horns had created a lively interest . Meanwhile the voice of the tribal crier was lifted up . Resonantly his chanting call arose ; and several times , in the melodious speech of the Omaha tongue , he repeated that long-drawn call of his , musically summoning people to prayer . For this project of the Indians , this fair , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was something serious ; it had to begin with public worship . Under a large assembly tent a brief service was held . The solo cornetist of the hand led the hymns , and the congregation stood up while a venerable Indian devoutly prayed . These religious exercises , I recall , were the only parr of the programme that was carried out as scheduled for the first day . Much work still remained to be done , we were told , before the fair would properly be put in order ; but if things were not ready to-day , there was always to-morrow . Why worry and fuss and fume over the belated arrival of exhibits ? That Wednesday had been scheduled as the opening day was , of course , unimportant ; Thursday , or even Friday , would do as well . Nobody cared . I say nobody , but I am forgetting Pat . He was one who cared . " Can you beat it ? " I heard him demanding with an injured tone . He wanted to photograph the Indian president of the Fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you please . Maybe to-morrow . " As it turned out , it was much better to have waited , for on the day following the president ! , whose native name , Neka-ga-he , signifies Head Man , or Chief ) brought with him his tribal costume , so that the picture we wanted might have the distinction of his ceremonial robes . Now that the photographer had been thus favored , we had thought to see him turn cheerful at once ; but no , we soon afterward heard him inveighing against the treatment of two visitors who had come a long journey , all the way from Oklahoma . Notables of the Osage people we knew them to be , and yet they were being given no more attention , Pat said , than if they were wooden Indians in front of a cigar-store . A nice way to act ! What kind of politeness did I call that ? Courtesy of the plains is really what it was . Any one should have known that , seeing with what quiet dignity the visitors were welcomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief Iron Eye . They were received with no effusiveness , no airs , no artificial animation ; for it is Indian etiquette to assume that the guest coining to your prairie camp has traveled far and must be quite tired out ? as hungry , too , as he is fatigued . Very well , then ; get him food . Let him eat . smoke , rest . For a generous period silence must be his , before he is bothered with talk and social attentions . Not less interesting to us was the meaning expressed in a tepee that we saw two native women setting lip . Following ancient tradition , the framework of the lodge began with four poles ? four to symbolize the forces of the Four Winds . Then , t h e skeleton cone having been sheeted up , we noted how the cover had been decorated with a scalloped circle of yellow . This , they told us , was emblematic of the Sun Father , he whose marriage with our Mother , the Earth , has brought forth life , everything in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird , and the generations of man , from the first to the last . Said the venerable tribesman , when consulted about his religion : " The white people read of God in a printed book ; but we Indians see God . We see Him in his wonder-working , in growing grass and green trees , in the blue of the sky or the rain falling . Yes , and in the breathing of the four winds He comes to us . " There again you have it ? that mystic number , four . They are Wakanda 's spirit-strength , those Four Winds . They are powers unseeable , incalculable ? forces worthiest of all to be conspicuous in the red man 's sacred rituals ! In the headwork embroidery displayed within an exhibition tent , gay with specimens of careful needlecraft , we observed that an embellishing design much used was a four-pointed leaf ; in the shinny game scheduled for the Indian boys to play , the ball , as usual , would representthe earth and the players the four winds ; we heard , besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tribal gardening , four in number were the kernels of sacred red corn given to each family . For red , the symbol of life , betokens fertility , and by its addition all the seed-corn was made holy for the sacrament of the planting , in that sweet time of year when the oak-tree has uncurled the tender green of his leaves " to a bigness no bigger than a baby rabbit 's ears . " Once an Irishman is told of these things , even an obstinate Irishman , you may know his Celtic imagination can not he kept from responding to the lure of them . " Poetic , " said Pat , but he still held to the opinion that the bluish tattoo spot centrally adorning the brown foreheads of certain Indian women was something as queer , nearly , as the styles of white women that you see in the fashion magazines . What was the meaning , he asked , of the blue polka-dot on a maiden 's forehead ? He insisted on knowing that , and he kept up such a questioning about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , which was this : in tribal life it was not the man of wealth . but the man of unselfishness , who was held highly in favor ; he was esteemed not for what he had , but for what he had given away . Let him distinguish himself as a gift-giver and feast-maker , then might it be the privilege of his daughters to wear the symbol of the father 's generosity . To this day the round , blue spot on the forehead , the honor-mark , is the detail of personal adornment most coveted by women of the tribe . Nor did it belong more properly to any woman , we learned , than to the one busy with the arrangement of agricultural displays inside the shed-like in-closure of boards , the exhibition booth . FROM MOCCASIN And to her , Mary Mitchell , credit was also given for being the most energetic promoter of the Indian fair . Now , for a time , we watched her sorting vegetable specimens on the shelves and tables corn , cabbages , beets , tur-nips , squash , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potatoes . In front of the booth she had ranged the slatted crates from which chickens , ducks , geese , turkeys , and guinea fowl put forth their heads inquiringly , as if to ask , " Oh , dear ! what 's all this about ? " Within the booth , by the way , were Indian vegetables quite unfamiliar to the white man 's garden . First were tribal specimens of corn in many hues ? white , yellow , red , brown , blue , gray , deep rose , blue-black , and speckled . Always this starchy maize has been much valued by the Indians , for two reasons : it is deliciously edible , whether ripe or in the milky state , and it is a soft grain easily ground to flour . Other secrets of native food-supply were likewise revealed to us . We saw the tither of the pond-lily , which the muskrat , clever fellow , knows is good to eat . The Indian housewife also knows that . He harvests those tubers ; she helps herself to his harvest ; underground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shrewdly searching , until she finds and pilfers all his hoard . Later on these treasures of the earth are dished up roasted , as toothsome as they are rich in nutritive value . The wood-rat , the field-mouse , the vole , and the shrew were all creatures whose garnering frugality the Indian wife well understood . Let them beware , these cunning rodents , how they hid their supplies , lest she come searching with her pointed stick . Through long experience she knows where the rat will he likely to tuck away his cache of wild plums , grapes , and choke-cherries . The vole ? that wee , secretive meadowmouse ? will also be obliged to surrender the half-bushel of wild beans and hazelnuts he has neatly packed away into the tunnels of his granary underground . As for the shrew ? that tiny , sharp-nosed burrower ? he need nor suppose that his provisions are undiscoverable . Wild pease and artichokes he will have to yield to the clay pot of the tepee-dweller , and also the tuber of a certain sedge , the delectable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native vegetable , the peanut . Samples of the ground-nut , resembling brown marbles , and likewise samples of the wild bean , resembling brown pebbles , were on view in the exhibition-booth ; but these articles of Indian diet were merely a souvenir of old tribal days , before the Omaha people had developed , on an expansive scale , their agricultural resources . Originally , so I have been told , the tribesfolk did not take kindly to the white man 's way of enormous crop production ; and of the faction most strenuously opposed to the new order of life was the famous old hunter , White Horse . What , was it ordered that he take to the plow ? he , too ? Well , he would do no such thing . Neither would he go to church . At least , he had at first been so resolved ; but seeing that Chief Iron Eye had commanded everybody to a:t tend Sunday services at Father Hamilton 's Mission . White Horse did not quite see fit to ignore the injunction . He erudginrly obeyed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor and how Sunday was set apart as a day of rest , a holy day . If you worked on that day you would not prosper ; the devil would make you trouble . Now White Horse , it is said , had never been known to work ; but coming home from Sunday services at the Mission , he immediately seized a spade , flung off his blanket , and began to dig , laboring with patience , diligently , until the sun had gone down . Thus did he express defiance . Every Sunday he expressed it ; he did nothing but toil and sweat . Meanwhile he saw no devil , nor had luck . He raised a better garden than anybody . And oh , the joy of that ! Triumph unspeakable ! So inordinately proud was White Horse of his achievement that he could not help developing agricultural ambitions . Afterward he farmed not only on Sunday , but on every day in the week ; it is even said that among all the Omaha people there was not a field laborer more zealous than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well for him , surely ; for one has only to see the prodigality of standing grain , in this country of green hills , to realize that in all the state of Nebraska ( whose yield of corn for the past year was estimated at zoo , - 000,000 bushels ) there can he no fields , anywhere , more productive than these of the Indians in Thurston County . At their fair , before the exhi-bition booth , as I stood examining the fruits of the red man 's toil and re-flecting upon his remarkable ad-justment to the commercial expediencies of modern life , my thoughts were presently interrupted by the chuck-and-clack of a wagon slowly approaching . Near me the heavy vehicle came to a halt , while the driver , a gray-haired Indian , gave the reins a twist about the handle of the brake , and de-scended to the ground in two deliberate steps , a moccasined foot treading first on the tire of the front wheel and then on the greasy hub . Having brought his contribution of vegetables to compete for prizes , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stayed by his friend , the son of the late Chief Iron Eye . It was Mr. Francis La Flesche , whose illuminating studies of Indian life , made for the Bureau of Ethnology , are widely known ; and when I saw him putting a typewritten communication into the hands of that old man , I was seized at once with the liveliest curiosity . Afterward Mr. La Flesche made clear to me the meaning of the letter . First of all I learned the name of the veteran farmer ? Ma-ha-wa , the Conqueror . Prejudice he had indeed conquered ? prejudice against the hard manner of life that none among his people had wanted to accept . Long ago , I was told , he was among the first to see the coming of the inevitable . Wild game would vanish away , the bow would be broken , the era of the plow must come . So , with a stout heart , bravely , Ma-ha-wa had put himself to learning the labors of the field . What matter that the snows of many winters were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is nothing at all that you have come down to old age , if only you have a stout heart and the willingness to toil ! Now the distinction of being a gift-giver may have come to Ma-ha-wa in the old days , years and years ago ; but if it came not then , I wonder who , among all his tribe , is worthier to-day of that honor . For this is what was told to me by the chief 's son : Not many months ago the aged Indian was informed of nations fighting beyond the east wind , across the great waters . He heard also of a peaceful people brought low by mighty guns whose bigness of fire-speech is as a power to shake the bones of the world . He learned of them , and how the fields of the peaceful people were laid waste , and their lands taken , and their homes demolished . No good that their braves had fought strongly ! Only defeat had come of it ? defeat and death and broken bodies fluttering moldy rags . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? Ma-ha-wa knew . He knew , and pitied , and wanted very much to show , somehow , that his heart had gone out to those people in their suffering . But what might he do in kindness for them ? he , an old man , so far away ? He was informed , of course , that money might at least he sent ; and though his was not a fat purse . he ? well , yes , there were two ten-dollar notes that could very well he spared . He was sure they could ; and he did indeed spare them . The typewritten letter attested that he had . I saw his wrinkled fingers re-ceive the page cautiously , as if it might get broken ; I saw him stand motionless , listening , while his friend , the chief 's son , explained to him those words on the paper . They were from the Minister of Belgium , at Washington ; they were thanks , graciously expressed , not alone for the gift of dollars that had been sent , but more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart .
