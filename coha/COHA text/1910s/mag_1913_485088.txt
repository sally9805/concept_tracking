Somewhat later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " The Heart 's Country " The Medici Society announces the publication of the third and final volume of the Riccardi Press " Canterbury Tales " A number of religious book are in preparation by Longmans , Green &; Co , among them the following " The Life in Grace , " by the Rev.

E Holmes ; " Pastor F'uturus , " by the Rev Dr. John Huntley Shrine ; " God 's Cooperative Society , " by the Rev Charles L. Marson , and " Thesaurus Fidelium , " compiled by Carmelite Tertiary In the second portion of the library of the late Edward Dowden , which was put up at auction last week , were several interesting items There was the " Polimanteia , " 1595 , which contains the second known mention of Shakespeare It is a unique copy containing the author 's name in full , William Covell , and not William Clerke , as usually supposed There were also contemporary manuscripts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the original proof-sheets of De Quincey 's essay on " The English Mail Coach " Mr. Arnold Haultain , who as literary executor is preparing a second series of Gold-win Smith 's letters , will be grateful for the use of any letters by Smith which were not included in the first series published last spring Communications addressed care of the Bank of Montreal , No 47 Threadneedle Street , London , E C , will be gratefully acknowledged To the new edition of Thomas Hardy 's works , Harpers have added a volume of short stories which have not hitherto been collected in book form While these tales naturally do not represent the great Hardy of " The Return of the Native " and " Tess , " they are well worth preserving If for nothing else one might read through Prof John MacCunn 's " Political Philosophy of Burke " ( Longmans ) for the succession of splendid quotations ; and , indeed , their number and richness may bring some little surprise even to the reader who accounts himself pretty familiar with his Burke Professor MacCunn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornate character of Burke 's , but it is a genuine and refined style and offers an admirable setting for the quotations The book , however , is no mere collection of striking passages Professor MacCunn uses these rather as the structure of an admirable exposition of Burke 's ideas He has a profound respect for his author , and by nature , it is evident , a deep sympathy with the philosophy of the " Reflections , " the " Appeal , " etc , but at the end , when he summarizes the subject and shows Burke 's relation to , and value for , the present , he writes and criticises as one thoroughly immersed in the current conceptions of democracy The final point at issue is Burke 's theory of a " natural aristocracy . " which he accepts , and Burke 's feeling that the only way to make sure of the existence of such an aristocracy is through the controlling power of prescriptive rights , with which feeling he totally disagrees To discuss the issue. , as thus raised by Professor MacCunn would take us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate two points which he neglects and which , to some readers at least , will seem of vital importance He is aware of a certain conflict between Burke 's profound sympathy for the lower strata of society and an insistence on the exclusion of them from the active body politic . But he does not explain how this conflict arises in part from the fact that Burke 's philosophy , implicitly at least , is based on the seventeenth-century distrust of human nature , while in some ways he was deeply influenced by the eighteenth-century trend of humanitarianism Still more vital is Professor MacCunn 's failure to exhibit the character of the " natural aristocracy , " which , as he thinks , must arise from the general prevalence of democracy . His theory calls for a very different meaning for the word " aristocracy " from that which it had in Burke 's vocabulary , yet he does not explain this difference . A large amount of labor has gone into the making of " The Book of the Epic , the World 's Great Epics Told in Story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The author has given summaries not only of the main epics of western Europe , but of Balkan , Persian , Indian , Japanese , and Chinese works , together with brief facts of literary history . For the summaries alone , undistinguished as their , style is , many a student will be grateful ; they should serve as a most convenient work of reference . Take , for example , such a complicated and , it must be confessed , often confused poem as " The Faerie Queens " Even the few mortals now living who have read it through can not hope to keep the order of its incidents clearly in mind , and without the help of a detailed r  --  sum ? might require no small amount of time trying to discover some desired portion The introductions furnished by Mr. Guerber will be read with caution , Because of the necessity of compressed statement he has had at times to generalize without qualifications in matters which are extremely complex and indeed doubtful . In certain cases he has accepted unfounded rumors , as when he states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sister of the Duke of Ferrara Elsewhere he espouses a mere theory , asserting , for instance , that " Beowulf " was composed in Sweden and later reworked in England Speaking of the origins of Arthurian romance , he implies that Midas and Nennius collaborated In general the author furnishes dates , but it would have been well if he had done so in connection with all the works and authors mentioned He might also , to advantage , have drawn up a bibliography of the approved books of very general compass bearing on his subject . To most readers Elizabeth Berkeley , wife of the sixth Lord Craven and afterwards of the Margrave of Anspach , is known as the friend of Horace Walpole whose eccentrici- , ties at once annoyed and amused that loyal correspondent If her portraits do not flatter , she was indeed " The Beautiful Lady Craven , " as A. M. Broadley and Lewis Melville entitle their new book ( Lane ) ; and if her original memoirs told the truth , as they most emphatically do not , she was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were first published in 1826 , when the author , then the Margravine of Anspach , was in her seventy-sixth year . She had been sent away by her first husband , Lord Craven , for reasons good and sufficient , she had wandered over Europe with various friends and , protectors , had conquered the Mar-grave and after the death of his wife married him , and now , in the coolness of age , rich , and externally rehabilitated , she had settled down in England with the open attempt to win her way back into proper English society . She succeeded in getting about her a brilliant if somewhat miscellaneous circle , despite the coldness of her kinswoman , Queen Charlotte . The most amusing feature of the present publication is the contrast between the facts of her life as narrated by Messrs Broadley and Melville in the long introduction which occupies half of the first volume , and the romance of her life as she paints it . She was herself not an ill writer , though without brilliance , and her memoirs have a certain historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , for her chief instrument of falsification was the simple expedient of leaving things out . The editors have added footnotes which considerably enhance the value of the work . There are also many illustrations , derived in part from Mr. Broadley 's great collection of manuscripts and prints of the period . No fearsome man would attack such a subject as " American Ideals , Character , and Life " ( Macmillan ) . Possibly Mr. Hamilton Wright Mabie would not have attacked it if he had not been appointed the first exchange lecturer from the United States on the Carnegie Peace Endowment . He wished to do for our country what Dr. Inazo Nitobe did for Japan in " The Japanese Nation : Its Land and Its People , " a series of lectures delivered in this country on the same foundation This book of Mr. Maine 's is of course the series of lectures he delivered , chiefly before university audiences , in Japan . To do this subject justice one should possess not only wide and accurate information , but unusual powers of insight and analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has made him familiar with several sides of American life , but it does not appear to have singularly endowed him with the critical powers just mentioned . His attempt " to sketch with a free hand and in large outline the development of the American people " does not result in a very illuminating interpretation of the American spirit . Three whole chapters are devoted to the course of our literature . As a history , they are too short . As an explanation of present America , they are not so written as to reveal our heart and soul . The writer 's familiarity with the field has led him astray from the purpose of the lectures . Political America , on the other hand , which , for a Japanese audience , one would suppose the most interesting and sig , nificant feature of our national life , the feature best fitted to exemplify the American ideal , is confined to one short chapter of general description . Our industrial activity , which is surely in some respects typical and unique , receives only sporadic consideration . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  our interest in education , the pervading belief in its efficacy from colonial times . So far as the book has a central conviction , this side of our idealism supplies it . Mr Mabie declares that his addresses were delivered to audiences " of unusual intellectual alertness . " It will take a similar reading public to follow with interest the printed form . The statement of ideas is prevailingly abstract and general Concrete details and illustrative examples are consistently omitted . No sententious Judgments or sharp outlines for the mind to hang to , no color or imagery to stick in the memory , are employed in explaining what ' is one of the most intangible of subjects  --  the nature and controlling spirit of a vast people . Henry Bradley adds to the " Oxford English Dictionary " the section SEVERALSHASTER ( Clarendon Press ) Therein is an article running above eighteen columns on the unruly verb " shall , " which goes far towards justifying the Dogberryian dictum that " to be a well-favoured man is the gift of fortune , but to write and read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a million , " wrote the accurate Macaulay in 1837 , " ever misplaces his will and shall . " Oh , to have descended from a pure line of Cockneys ! " Perhaps no Scot , " says the Daily News in 1891 , " ever yet mastered his shalls ' and ' wills ' " In certain cases " shall " is sternly proclaimed a shibboleth " In the first person , shall has , from the early Middle English period , been the normal auxiliary for expressing mere futurity . . . . ( To use will in these cases is now a mark of Scottish , Irish , provincial , or extra-British idiom ) " In the history of certain other cases , however , there is consolatory matter for dwellers in the provinces and men of Scotch-Irish extraction ; there are precedents various enough to make even the infallible Londoner sigh for the iron dogma of the schoolmaster From a literary standpoint the most interesting discussion in this section is on the word " shard-born " or " shard-borne " in " Macbeth , " III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that this epithet of the drowsy-humming beetle Meant " born in dung , " but his interpretation has been generally rejected in favor of the explanation that " shard " means the " hard wing cases " on which the beetle is " borne , " and the editors of the Clarendon Press Shakespeare , for example , say that Toilet 's reading is " unquestionably wrong " Mr. Bradley , with the support of fresh instances of " shard " meaning " dung , " maintains that Toilet was unquestionably right If the Tollet-Bradley interpretation stands , posterity , reading in entomological works or in the " Hiawatha " of Longfellow of the beetle 's " shining shards ; ' will be entitled to a learned smile . Some of the " low " words from this hemisphere will bear more investigation than they are receiving . Americans who have heard all their lives the word " shack " ? a rough cabin or shanty  --  will be surprised to find the first recorded example dated 1881 ( New York Times ) . " Shack " ? meaning " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance " ? is explained and illustrated only by definitions taken from two American dictionaries To the writer of this note , " shag " would more accurately represent the sound heard on the " diamond " in the cry , " Shag it l " He is familiar , too , with an unnoticed intransitive use of the word , as , for example , in " Let us shag into town " ? meaning to go on foot Mr. Bradley traces the word " shark " from the year 1569 , when Sir John Hawkins 's men brought one of the tribe to London , and he duly illustrates the figurative senses in such phrases as " loan shark , " " land shark , " etc . But he entirely overlooks the admired and rehabilitated " shark " known to the American college world : primarily , the student who devours and digests learning with ease ( not to be confused with the successful " grind " ) , and , secondarily , one who excels in any line of activity With his mind fixed on the notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what would an Oxford editor make of our college stories ? Cf. Richard Holbrook in " Stories of the Colleges , " 1901 , p. 94 : " laughed Jarvis , ' you 're a real shark ' " , also , Williams College " Class Book , " 1903 , p. 29 , " Dido ' is a Math . shark of the first water . " On no account should " A Leisurely Tour in England " ( Macmillan ) be opened at the first page of chapter i , and thence perused conscientiously from cover to cover . The method of reading should be modelled on the sketch map of the author 's tour , in which the red line that marks his progress has neither beginning nor end ; that is to say , the book should be picked up in a leisurely hour , opened ' at random , and read for so long as leisure and inclination serve . The author , James John Hissey , has a fair list of books to his credit , all dealing with the same subject , tours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicles . The means of progression chosen for the purposes of the present volume was a small automobile , which , as Mr Hissey sagely remarks , " is an excellent servant , though in truth a bad master , " and each day 's journey was made without any definite end in view . His tour took him from Eastbourne on the south coast of England to Aberdovey on the west coast of Wales . He avoided large towns , travelled generally along by-roads , stopped for contemplation or conversation , and made detours whenever the spirit moved him , and at the end of the day noted down in gossipy style what he had seen and done and heard . With but little alteration the present volume , of nearly 400 pages , consists of these notes , illustrated with photographs and sketches by the author . It is a very pleasant book to read , full of the author 's personality and prejudices . There is a genuine love for beautiful scenery and beautiful architecture ; above all , for what is old and mellowed Mr. Hissey avows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe guess that never in his life has he voted for other than a Tory candidate of the truest blue , for the sight of a disused windmill instantly impresses him with the desirability of putting a tax on flour One point in the narrative should be noted for especial gratitude. the automobile in which the tour was made is kept severely in its place as a means of progression only , and is not allowed , in the modern fashion , to obtrude itself as a character in the story . The Selden Society , acting upon its recently declared purpose , of issuing yearly when practicable an extra volume supplementing the regular series of the Year Books , has sent to its members two numbers for the year 1913 ( London : Quaritch ) . The first of these , Vol . XXVIII , contains select Charters of Trading Companies , the other , Vol XXIX , the Eyre of Kent , 6 ana 7 Edward II , volume three The volume of select charters has the text of forty-one grants to companies , ranging in date from 1530 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the Patent Rolls in the Public Record Office . These grants include incorporations of merchants trading abroad , of companies for plantation , mining , fishing , insurance , and water supply , and for the manufacture of starch , soap , salt , saltpetre , paper , linen , tapestry , and silk . Thus the volume can be used as a kind of documentary appendix to Scott 's " Joint Stock Companies to 1720 . " The editor , Cecil T. Carr , has contributed a useful introduction , the most novel feature of which is the close relation revealed between the trading companies , as joint stock undertakings , and the gilds and municipalities of earlier times As the trading company which crossed the water , with its charter and a majority of its governing body , and settled the colony of Massachusetts was an incorporated joint stock organization , it is evident that many of the institutional features of early New England history were derived from the customs and practices of the medieval gilds of England Mr. Carr is not the first to point out this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an origin , basing their belief upon points of resemblance and other matters of internal evidence . But he is the first to show the continuity of the connection from the liveries of London , through the corporation of the Merchant Adventurers , to the trading company , and thence to the companies for plantation in Virginia , Bermuda , Massachusetts , and Old Providence . The new volume of the Year Books is the eighth in the general series , and the third of the Eyre of 1313-1314 . It continues the volumes issued in 1909 and 1912 , by adding the reports of civil actions under the remaining titles alphabetically arranged from Mortdancestor to Variance . After an analysis of the eases in the volume , the editor , William C. Bolland , discusses at some length in his introduction the important light which one of the cases throws on a cryptic remark of Glanville 's to the effect that the assize of Mortdancestor did not lie in respect of burgage tenure because of another assize which governed such lands and tenements . This assize , which Pollock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the archives of our boroughs , " Mr. Bolland has discovered , though he is still unable to write its history . It is the assize of Fresh Force . Curiously enough , the name borne by this writ had no equivalent in French or Latin , being written " Fresheforce " in the one and " Frisca Forcia " in the other , in this respect differing from other writs in English law . Other ? cases in the volume furnish many interesting , if somewhat trivial , details of value for social history Such , for example , is the item that a hare was valued at but half the amount of a rabbit , or to be more accurate a cony , as the term " rabbit " up to the early years of the seventeenth century was confined to the young of the cony . The cheaper rate at which the hare was held was undoubtedly due to the dislike felt by the richer classes for the hare as an article of food and to their preference for the flesh of the cony . Burton in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he characterizes the hare as " black meat , melancholy , and hard of digestion , " breeding when eaten an " incubus , " and causing " fearful dreams " As other mediaval writers testify to the same belief , it would be interesting to know whence such a remarkable view of the gastronomic effects of eating hare 's meat arose Capt Henry Francis Brownson , soldier , author , and lawyer , formerly of New York city , died at his home in Detroit , on Friday . He was born at Canton , Mass , in 1835 . He was graduated from Holy Cross College , Worcester , Mass. , and was admitted to the bar in 1856 . Previously he had studied in Paris and at the University of Munich . For gallant service in the battle of Malvern Hill he received the brevet of captain Capt Brownson was the translator of " Love of Mary " from the Italian ; of Balmes 's " Fun-damental Philosophy " from the Spanish , and Tarducci 's " Life of Columbus " from the Italian . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Faith and Science , " and " Equality and Deniocracy . " The Rev. Thomas Kingsmill Abbott , librarian of Trinity College , Dublin , and a noted scholar and writer , died in that city on Thursday of last week . He was born in Dublin in 1829 , and was educated at Trinity College , where he was profesSor of moral philosophy , 1867-72 , of Biblical Greek , 1875-88 , and of Hebrew , 1879-1900 . He wrote many books , both scientific and religious , among them being " Elementary Theory of the Tides , " " Do This in Remembrance of Me , " and " Sight and Touch . An Attempt to Disprove the Berkeleian Theory of Vision . "
