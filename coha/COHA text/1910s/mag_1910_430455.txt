 |p748  IN special message to Congress on the Sherman Anti-Trust Law and the proposal for a Federal incorporation act , President Taft both outlined the answer to a question that has very much perplexed many of the large business interests of the country , and , at the same time , voiced his deep concern over two phases of the modern business tendency . The question is as to the line of separation between " good trusts " and " bad trusts . " The first cause of concern to the President is the failure of men of . large affairs , particularly those generally embraced under the term " big business , " to interpret accurately their own relation to the commerce laws . The second is the desirability of preserving for the country the economic principle of combination , which , as now practically applied , is almost wholly under the ban of the law . The inability of " big business " to obtain an authoritative answer to its question is perhaps responsible , at least in part , for its failure to apply the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Administration at Washington was recently discussing this situation and declared , with great emphasis , that it is high time for the managers of " big business " to wake up to the fact that they too are just as amenable to the law as their neighbors . Then he told this story to illustrate their attitude . He went to church one day with a lady who was , as he described her , " the best round dancer I ever saw . " She was extremely fond of dancing , and was a specially good waltzer . It chanced that the pulpit was occupied that day by a visiting clergyman , who delivered a sermon of tremendous vigor , devoted largely to a denunciation of dancing , and particularly round dances . He said that waltzing was the path to perdition , the road to everlasting damnation , with much that was even more vehement . When the service was over and they were leaving the church , the lady turned to the Administration official , with whom she had waltzed many times , and said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman smiled , and answered with a counter question : " Are you going to give up dancing ? " Utterly astonished that such a personal application of the sermon should be made . the lady replied , with great earnestness : " Why , he did n't mean us ! " Now President Taft has made , in his message , some statements calculated to dissipate the belief so largely prevalent that the law " does n't mean us . " He refers to the fact that the court decisions show " that the anti-trust act has a wide scope and applies to many combinations in actual operation . " Also he plainly points out that he regards if as his duty to institute proceedings against " all the industrial companies with respect to which there is any reasonable ground for suspicion that they have been organized for a purpose and are conducting business on a plan which is in violation of the AntiTrust Law . " A personal experience of another Administration lawyer illustrates the extent to which this warning of the President is applicable and shows how even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet go counter to it in their business . He had been retained in an advisory  |p749  capacity by a big corporation which had a number of subsidiary companies . He was summoned to the office of the head of the corporation one day , and something like this was said to him : " Look here , we want to know just where we stand with regard to the Interstate Commerce Law . We do n't intend to violate any law if we know it , and if we ca n't do business without violating the law , we ' 11 go out of business . Now , you look over these contracts and tell us if they are all right or not . If they are not , make ' em so . " There were about eighty contracts , and nearly every one of them was in violation of the law . Occasionally in the last few months direct appeal has been made to the Administration by business men who wished advice as to how the law affected them . Such appeals are usually accompanied by the declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that there must be some way for it to continue its existing methods without running counter to the Department of Justice . Not long ago a delegation of Eastern manufacturers called upon President Taft upon such an errand . They were in a " combination " ; that is , they had made an agreement among themselves as to some things which they would or would not do . The manner in which the Government was proceeding against certain concerns for violation of the Sherman law , and the recent decisions of the courts in such cases , had set them to thinking about themselves . They were worried . They did not believe that they were doing anything illegal , but they had begun to suspect that the Government might think they were . So they went to the President about it . They took with them several of their contracts , which they wished to submit to the President for his personal perusal . They dilated upon their misfortune in being unable to secure from any authoritative source an accurate charting of the boundary between legal and illegal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were sure . But the Department of Justice would not point it out for them , and nowhere could they get responsible advice . Their spokesman addressed the ' President substantially thus : " Mr. President , we do not feel that we are doing anything wrong , but we want to know . We are engaged in a legitimate business , in what we think is a legitimate way . We do not burn , or steal , or exact rebates , or use false weights . Now , we should like to have you look at our contracts and see for yourself just what we are doing . It seems to us there must be some line that business can get within and be safe , and we want to know where it is . The Department of Justice can not give us advice , and so we have come to you . " But the President did not read their contracts . He merely asked them two questions . The first was , " Do you seek to control prices ? " and the second was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To both of these questions the answer was in the affirmative . Thereupon the President spoke to this effect : " That ' s all I wish to know . I do n't need to read your contracts . You ask if you come under the Sherman law . I can tell you right now , on the answers you have just given , that you do . " Of course , in putting these words in quotation-marks , it is not intended to convey the impression that they exactly reproduce all that conversation ; but they do give substantially and fairly the gist of what was said on both sides . The President 's callers were surprised and disturbed at what he told them ; but they were more surprised and more disturbed when he went on to say that there was only one recourse for them , and that was to " quit fooling around about what your competitors are trying to do , " and get back to the good old system of doing business contemplated by the law , where competition has its free and uninterrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as these gentlemen had expected to find . The Anti-Trust Law does not concern itself with " good " and " bad " trusts , or corporations or combinations . It deals broadly with them all under one classification , and denounces them all equally . It is true that the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States in Interstate Commerce cases have tended recently to take some cognizance of the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the restraint involved in a contract or combination . Sometimes that feature has been particularly pointed out , as in the opinion  |p750  filed by Justice Brewer in the celebrated Northern Securities case , where he concurred with the majority of the court that the merger was illegal , but specified that it was so because the restraint found was unreasonable . The opinion of the Circuit Court in the Standard Oil case , which , at this writing , is on appeal to the Supreme Court , declared that the test of the legality or illegality of a combination is its necessary effect upon competition . " If the necessary effect is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court , it does not violate the law . " But if its necessary effect is to stifle or directly and substantially to restrict " competition , it is illegal . But these decisions come very far from drawing a legal line between " good " and " bad " trusts . " The public , especially the business public , " says President Taft in his message , " ought to rid themselves of the idea that such a distinction is practicable or can be introduced into the statute . Certainly under the present Anti-Trust Law no such distinction exists . " . It is not to provide such a distinction that the President is asking Congress to pass a Federal incorporation act , but to establish a realm of law where business shall not be condemned merely because it is big or is done by combination . Mere bigness is in itself innocent , and honest combination has a decided economic value . The President points out that the object of the Anti-Trust Law was to suppress the " abuses " of business , and not to " interfere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no advantage of its size by methods akin to duress to stifle competition . " There could be nothing " more destructive to the prosperity of the country , " he says , than the loss of the economy of production through combination . What he is anxious to do is to save this economy , but at the same time to surround the application of the principle with such safeguards for the public as will prevent the unjust use of it . He is , in fact , undertaking the extremely difficult task of compelling business by law to be fair . Men less hopefully altruistic than the President despair of his being able to accomplish it , but Mr. Taft and his legal advisers are something more than sanguine that the measures they have proposed will solve the problem . In the consideration of the subject by the President and his legal advisers , which has been going on constantly ever since Mr. Taft was inaugurated a year ago , Attorney-General Wickersham has taken a large and effective part . And besides many conferences with the representatives of business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a little campaign of education among the public , delivering a number of speeches in which he has dealt with the control of corporations and their relation to the Federal law . He has pointed out that the difficulty felt by the business world lies in the fact that the Anti-Trust Law is destructive rather than constructive . It merely denounces and prohibits . It does not set up any clearly defined limits within which business may go its way without menace of public prosecution . It needs no argument to show that the Sherman law denunciation of " every contract and every combination " is too broad . Take , for instance , the building up of any one of the great railroad systems of the day . In each of them there are numerous " combinations " of small roads which are manifestly of substantial benefit to the country , and which no one wishes to undo , although there may also be other " combinations " just as clearly detrimental to public interests . There are scores of beneficial combinations in the country . They arc based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the managers of the combination seek to secure for themselves all the benefit of the use of that economic principle , without sharing at all with the public , that the combination necessarily becomes detrimental . The effort to provide a safe haven for these beneficial combinations , however , is one of the utmost delicacy . It requires the greatest wisdom and care . Many propositions for amending the Sherman law have been made , all aimed at the same result . Toward the close of his Administration , President Roosevelt went so far as to give his support to the particular proposition that was brought forth under the auspices of the Civic Federation and introduced in both houses of Congress . But every such proposition yet advanced has been found , upon careful study , to be defective . There has been in them greater danger of weakening the Sherman law  |p751  where it is desirable to maintain its strength than there was promise of merely ameliorating the provisions of law that now bear too heavily upon business that is not harmful . The result is the conviction on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to leave the Sherman law as it is , and by a new piece of constructive , positive legislation provide the relief which it is desired to give to legitimate business . The plan of Federal . incorporation for concerns engaged in interstate commerce advocated by the President in his message has the cordial support of Attorney-General Wickersham and the other lawyers of the Cabinet , and of some of the leading lawyers of the Senate and House of Representatives as well . It has been pointed out by Mr. Wickersham that the increasing complexity and variety of regulation and taxation of foreign corporations by the various States in which their business is conducted , has rendered it more and more burdensome and difficult for one corporation to directly own and carry on business in a number of different States . ' This has led to the organization of domestic corporations under the laws of the respective States where business is to be conducted , the capital stocks of which are held by a " holding company " organized under the laws of that State where legislation is most encouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " much protection from State interference and discriminatory regulation " is now afforded to corporations doing an interstate business by the Interstate Commerce laws . " But more undisputed and clearly defined protection , " he adds , " would be secured by national incorporation . " He argues that Congress has the power to create corporations as a means to the exercise of its power to regulate interstate commerce , and cites as authority the cases of railroads , public highways , and the United States bank , which have been passed upon by the Supreme Court . If Congress has the power to create such corporations , says Mr. Wickersham , why has it not power to create also corporations to conduct that character of interstate commerce dealt with in the Sherman law ? " Such @# corporations , formed under the national law , " he adds , " would not be foreign corporations in any of the States , and would therefore be at liberty to transact their business without State permission and free from State interference . " Last summer , in a speech at Paducah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Wickersham , after giving his argument for Federal incorporation , said : Of course , many will object to the centralizing tendency of a national law authorizing the formation of corporations to carry on interstate business ; but such a law seems to me the inevitable result of economic conditions . The business of manufacture and sale , of barter and trade , is to-day conducted on such a vast scale that it can not be circumscribed by the boundaries of any one State . On the other hand no one State can effectively grapple with abuses of the vast power which modern conditions have placed in the hands of those who control great corporate enterprises . @# It is possible , of course , that Federal incorporation may not afford the measure of relief expected , and may even create a situation worse generally than that of the present through unshackling the very forces of combination inimical to free competition which it is desired to hold in check . The fear , in fact , that the great power for combination conferred by Federal incorporation would be used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some of the most persistent opposition to the proposed legislation . President Taft foresaw that clearly when he wrote his message and declared that " it is not the intention of the Government to desist in the least degree in its effort to end those combinations which are to-day monopolizing the commerce of this count try " : and " it is not the intention of the Government to permit this monopoly to exist under Federal incorporation , or to transfer to the protecting wing of the Federal Government a State corporation now violating the Sherman act . " The corollary of Federal incorporation is Federal supervision . With the power for proper regulation and control in its hands , the Government , it is pointed out , need  |p752  not fear the injurious effects of combination . No such Federal refuge for corporations as that suggested will ever be created with the assent of this Administration unless the power to regulate and control goes with it . And Mr. Taft 's message shows how drastic is the Government supervision proposed . The plan suggested by Mr. Taft and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition to it from " big business " itself . However much relief from the present situation is desired by business men , Federal supervision is not yet accepted with heartiness , although it is becoming steadily less unpopular , and even has some important advocates in the business world . But Federal incorporation has never had as much official support as now , and there is every prospect that before Congress adjourns there will be a new incentive to " big business " to accept it . It is admitted by high Administration officials that Supreme Court affirmation of the Circuit Court decisions in the Standard Oil and Tobacco Trust cases , now pending on appeal , will constitute virtually a mandate to the Government to institute similar suits against a wide range of corporations . At the present writing a large proportion of business is afflicted with dire perplexity as to its situation , despite the retort of the cynical corporation lawyer in New York , who , when a client complained that he could not tell whether he was violating the Anti-Trust Law or not , asked : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't you ? " @#
