TO-DAY I went to the Jewish detention camp in Kieff , with the wife of the French Consul here . She called for me in her limousine . As I think of it now , it was all so strange ? the smooth-running car with two men on the box , and ourselves in immaculate white summer dresses . The heat was intense , but we were well protected . Through the windows we saw others sweating and choking in the dust of the hot streets . I 'm afraid I 've brought you here on a very hot morning , ' said Mme. C ? apologetically . VOL. 121-NO . In spite of my curiosity I believe that I felt a distaste of the detention camp on such a day . A crowd is always depressing , and doubly so in the heat . But we stopped at a door cut in a high board-fence , and passed the sentinel into the enclosure where the Jews were penned while awaiting the next stage of their journey . Hundreds of faces turned toward us ; hundreds of eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white patriarchical beards flowing over their dirty black gowns ; there were younger men with peaked black caps and long black beards ; and there were women who had pushed back their black shawls for air , and who held sore-eyed , whining babies listlessly on their knees . Bits of old cloth stretched over poles afforded shade to some . Others tried to get out of the burning sun by huddling against the walls of the tenements that enclosed the yard on three sides . The ground was baked hard as iron and rubbed smooth by the shuffle of numberless feet . As we approached , the Jews rose and bowed low . Then they settled back into their former immobility . Some stared at us vacantly ; others lowered their eyelids and rubbed their hands together softly , with a terrible subservience . If we brushed close to one , he cringed like a dog who fears a kick . Yellow , parchment-like faces , all with the high-bridged curving noses and the black animal-like eyes . I was as detinitely separated from them as though there were tangible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at each other across a great gulf . They are human beings , ' I said to myself . ' I am one with them . ' But their isolation was complete . I could not even begin to conceive the persecution and suffering of ages that separated us . ' " All people are born free and equal , " indeed ! ' I turned away . This camp is run on communistic principles , ' Mme. C ? was explaining . ' The Jewish Ladies ' Benevolent Society provides a certain amount of meat and vegetables and bread , which is cooked and served by the Jews themselves . Here is the kitchen . ' We spoke French among ourselves , which seemed to put us further away from the dumb , watchful Jews behind us . ' If it was n't for us , they would starve . The government allows them eight kopeks a day . But who could live on that ? Besides , most of the Jews herepay the eight kopeks to the overseer , to avoid his displeasure . He makes a good revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been converted into a kitchen . A dozen or so Jewish women were paring and cutting up potatoes and cabbages and meat into huge soup-boilers . They were stripped to their shirts , and their bodies were drenched with perspiration . They curtsied to us and went on preparing dinner . A blast of scorching heat puffed out from an open oven : Two women , with long , wooden handles , pulled out big round loaves of black bread and laid them on a shelf to cool . The warm fragrance of cooking attracted some white-faced Jewish children . They edged into the kitchen and looked up at the food , their eyes impenetrable and glittering like mica . A woman cut up some bread and gave them each a piece , and they slunk outdoors again , sucking their bread . The food is scientifically proportioned to give the greatest possible nutriment , ' Mme. C said . We went out . After the kitchen heat the air of the courtyard was cool . This is the laundry . A certain number of the Jews here wash and iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible . ' The laundry was gray with steam . A dozen or so women were bending over wash-tubs . Like the women in the kitchen , they were stripped to their shirts . The wet cloth stuck to their sweating bodies and outlined their ribs and the stretch of muscles as they scrubbed and wrung out the clothes . When the water became too black , some young boys threw it out-of-doors , and the women waited for the tubs to be filled again , their red parboiled hands resting on their hips , in the way of washerwomen the world over . We crossed the mud before the wash- // house , on planks , and went into a house across the courtyard . This is the tailoring establishment , ' C ? continued . ' The tailors among them mend and cut over old clothes that we collect for them , so that every Jew may start on the next stage of his journey in perfectly clean and whole clothes . My husband and son complain that they will have to stay in bed soon , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the shoemakers . ' We looked into the adjoining room , where the cobblers sat cross-legged , sewing and patching and pegging shoes . It 's very hard to find the leather . But it is so important . If you could see how they come here ? their feet bleeding and swollen and their shoes in tatters . And many of them were rich bankers and professors in Galicia and Poland , used to their own automobiles like the rest of us . I think I would steal leather for them . ' The workers were different from the waiting Jews in the courtyard . Perhaps it was work that gave them importance in their own eyes , and took away that dreadful degrading subserviency ? degrading to us as much as to themselves . The whirring noise of the sewing-machines , the click of the shears , the bent backs of the workers , and the big capable hands , formed by the accustomed work ! The trade of every man could have been known by his hands ! My heart was warm toward them . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C ? . As though she guessed my thoughts , she replied , ' They are grateful for being allowed to-work . ' For being allowed to work . ' Those words damn much in the world . What hindrances we erect in the way of life ! And I looked out into the courtyard again , at the apathetic faces of the waiting Jews . Waiting for what ? The white dead faces , with the curved noses and hard bright eyes , all turned toward us . Were they submissive or expectant , or simply hating us ? They say the Galician Jews turn traitors and act as spies for the Austrians . But surely not these ! What could these broken creatures do ? How near to death they seemed ! The courtyard burned like a furnace . The shade was shrinking from moment to moment . The heat rose in blinding waves . I was sickened . The courtyard smelled of dirt and waste and sickness . It was unreal ? the whole thing unreal . Those working at usual , necessary tasks as well as those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in them all ! I went out into the courtyard , walking slowly in the scorching heat . There was no shade or coolness anywhere . My attention was drawn to a pregnant woman who had evidently been sitting in a thin strip of shade by the fence , but now the sun was beating down on her bare head . She sat with her arms hanging along her sides , the palms of her hands turned upwards . A baby hardly a year old twisted fretfully on her lap , fumbling at her breast with a little red hand . But she looked steadily over the baby 's round head , a curiously intent expression in her dark eyes , as though she were looking at something so far away that she must concentrate all of herself in it so as not to lose it from view . Under a canopy made from an old blue skirt lay a sick boy . His face was like a death-mask already , the yellow skin- stretched tightly over the bones of his face , and his mouth unnaturally wide , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes looked out unwinking , as though the lids had been cut off . He held himself halfway between a reclining and an upright position . No normal person could hold himself that way for long , but the sick boy kept himself motionless with maniacal strength . The flies hung over him like a cloud of black cinders . One of his friends attempted to keep them away with a leafy branch which he had found , Heaven knows where ! I could see no other sign of green in the place . As we passed , I noticed the branch sweep back and forth over the sick boy 's face , touching the skin . And still the fixed stare continued , uninterrupted ? that blind gaze straight out into emptiness ! At the farther end , an opening between two of the tenements led into a garden . This space , too , was crowded with waiting Jews . But where do they sleep ? ' I asked . ' Is there room for all those people in the houses ? ' ' No , ' Mrne . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came this last time . But fortunately , these summer nights are fine ; earlier , we had much rain , and you can picture the suffering . Then there was no shelter for them at all . They were simply herded into a pen , and many died from the exposure . Now , however , we have made conditions better for them . ' There was more reality here in the garden , where there was a suggestion of growing grass and a thin leaf shade . The Jews lay on the ground as if trying to get some coolness out of the earth . Up and down the paths walked a number of spectacled men , who were brought up to me and introduced as Professors So-and-so , and Doctors So-and-so . They were constantly trying to get in touch with friends in Kieff or Moscow or Petrograd , or colleagues in medicine or other sciences , or relatives who could help them . They worked through the society . By the payment of certain amounts they could bribethe overseers to let them stay on in the Kieff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . One man , a rich banker from Lvov , had been officially sick ' for several months , but as his money had almost given out he was in danger of being sent on to Tomsk in the near future . He lived in the hospital , where he had better quarters and food . These professors and doctors , men of wide learning and reputation , who are recognized as leaders in their professions , and are constructive , valuable forces in society , were herded together with the others , allowed to disappear into Siberia , where their minds and bodies will be wasted , and their possible future activity will count as nothing . A man in a soiled white coat came up , looked us over with little blinking pig eyes , and addressed a few words to Mme. C ? in Polish . That is the overseer , ' Professor A ? said to me in English . ' He takes every kopek away from us . But he is no worse than the rest . All along the way it is the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrugged indifferently . ' We most of us could have gathered together a little money . But what will you ? It was all so sudden . We had no time . Here we are , en tout cas . And after all , in the end  - -  -  ? I might have been talking with the professors on the campus of their own university . They exerted themselves to be attentive and entertaining , as if they were our hosts . One doctor said to me in French , ' I have seen your wonderful country . It is amazing . I would like to see it again . I have been asked to lecture . Perhaps , after the war ? ' He broke off abruptly . In a flash the end of his life came up to me . His work and ambitions , then the cleavage in his career ; the sharp division in his life ; the preparation of years , and then , instead of fulfillment , an exile to a country where life was a struggle for the bare necessities of the body ? food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white and nervous . What hideous , despairing moments he must know ! I asked him a question . His eyes blazed suddenly . Do not speak of these things ! They are not to be spoken of , much less to you . ' He looked as though he hated me . ' I beg your pardon , I am nervous . You must excuse me . ' He went away hurriedly . Poor chap ! ' Professor A said . ' It is hard for us all in this heat . And , yes , some of us have more imagination than others . ' A man in a uniform came into the garden . He walked to a tree in the centre , and stood in the shade , a long sheet of paper in his hand . There was a stir among the Jews . Those lying down got up and approached him . The women , with their children , dragged themselves nearer . Every one stopped talking . The apathy and indifference gave place to strained attention . There was a kind of dreadful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round the eyes and mouths , as if the same horrible fear fixed the same mark there . I have never seen a crowd where personality was so stamped out by A single overmastering emotion . The gendarme began to read in a singsong voice . What is he saying ? ' I whispered . The names of those who are to leave this afternoon , ' Mme. C ? replied . The garden was absolutely still except for the monotonous voice and the breathing of the crowd . Oh , yes , and the flies ! It was not that I forgot the flies , only their buzzing was the ceaseless accompaniment to everything that happened in the camp . How horrible this is ! ' Mme. Cobserved . ' They all know it must come , but when it does , it is almost unbearable . It is truly a list of death , Many of them here can not survive another stage of the journey in this heat . And yet they must be moved on to make place for those who are pressing on from behind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed on the way here , by the soldiers , because they could n't keep up with the procession . How could these civilians be expected to endure such hardships ? They are townspeople , most of them having lived indoors all their lives , like you or I. ' Like you or I ! ' No , no . It was unbelievable . I could not put myself in their place . I could not imagine such insecurity ? that lives could be broken in the middle in this way . How usebss it all seems ! ' I said . Useless . You think so ? ' Mme. C ? took me up . ' Do you realize that whole Galician towns have been moved into Siberia this summer ? Part of the way on foot , part in baggage-cars , where they stifled to death in the heat and for lack of water and food . One carload was n't listed , or was forgotten by some careless official , and when it was finally opened it was a carload of rotting flesh . The bodies were thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier reported him and he was court-martialed . One crowd of several thousand was taken to Siberia . They reached Tomsk . Then the government changed . What was the need to transport these Galician Jews , the new minister argued . A useless expense to the government . A waste of money and time . Let them go back to their homes . So the Jews were taken back over the same route , many more dying on the return journey , in the jails , and camps , and baggage-cars , or by the roadsides . They found themselves once more back in their pillaged towns , with nothing to work with , and yet with their livelihood to be earned somehow . They began to dig and plant and take up the routine of their lives once more . They began to look on themselves as human again . The grind of suffering and hopelessness began to let up and they had moments of hope . And then the reactionaries came into power with their systematic oppression of the Jews . Back to Siberia with them ! This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Kieff for the third time , a few weeks ago . Never shall I forget them as I saw them last . The mark of the beast was on them . You could n't call them living or suffering or martyrs any more . They were beyond the point where they prayed to die . ' The gendarme had finished his list . The tension relaxed . Some of the Jews settled 1 , ack into their former apathy ; others gathered in excited groups , pulling their beards and scratching their heads ; still others walked up and down the paths , restless , like so many caged animals . A man and a woman with two children approached the gendarme deprecatingly . The man asked a question , indicating the woman and children . The gendarme shook his head . The man persisted . The gendarme refused again , and started to move away . The man detained him with a hand on his arm . Another man approached . He spread out both hands , his shoulders up to his ears All three men spoke Polish in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I asked . " The gendarme has just read the names of the woman and children , who are to leave this afternoon . The father 's name is not with theirs . Naturally , he wants to be with his wife and children to protect and care for them as best he can . If they are separated now they can never find each other again in Siberia ? if they live till they get there . The third man is alone . He is willing to give up his place to the father , but the gendarme refuses . " His name is written . Yours is not . It is the order , " he says . ' The gendarme now left the garden . The woman was sobbing in her husband 's arms . He was patting her hair . The children hung at their mother 's skirt , crying and sucking their fingers . As I left the camp , the Jews were gathering about their rabbi . He stood in his long black robes , one hand raised . August 10 . Lately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a young woman whom the rest suspect of being a spy . She is dark , and never utters a word . All through dinner she keeps her eyes on her plate . I said something in French to her the other day , but , apparently , she did not understand . Across the table , the Morowski boys laughed at me . I suspect that they , too , had tried to speak to her , for she is pretty , and had been snubbed like me . I do n't know how the idea of her being a spy got round . She may have been sent here to keep her eyes on the Polish refugees in the pension . Her room is in our corridor , and this morning Marie saw , through the open door , Panna Lolla and Janchu talking to her . It appears that Janchu had been inveigled in by bon-bons , and Parma Lolla had gone in after him . Panna Lolla said the young woman was so lonely . She is a Pole and wants to leave Russia . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She showed Panna Lolla an old one that she wants to fix up for the police authorities . But she ca n't speak Russian , and is very frightened . She asked Panna Lolla if she knew any one who could write Russian . Marie forbade Patina Lolla to go near the woman again . It is just as well , for Panna Lolla likes excitement , and is capable of saying anything to keep it going . August . We were arrested four days ago ? and you will wonder why I keep on writing . It relieves my nerves . Ever since the revision Marie and I have gone over and over the same reasoning , trying to get at why we were arrested . To write it all out may help the restlessness and anxiety and ? yes ? the panicky fear that rises in my throat like nausea . Life is so terribly insecure . I feel as if I had been stripped naked and turned out into the streets , with no person or place to go to . It was four o'clock , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half we were leaving for Odessa . All our trunks and bags were packed , and our traveling suits brushed and pressed . And suddenly the door of our apartment opened . Six men came into the room , two in uniform , the other four in plain clothes . It never occurred to me that they had anything to do with me . I thought that they had mistaken the door . I looked at Marie questioningly . There was something peculiar about her face . The four plain-clothes men stood awkwardly about the door , which they had closed softly behind them . The two men with white cord loops across the breast of their uniforms went over to the table on the right and put down their black leather portfolios . They seemed to make themselves at home , and it angered me . What are these people doing here ? ' I asked Marie sharply . She addressed the officer in Polish , and he answered curtly . It 's a revision , ' she replied . A what ? ' ' A revision , ' she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motionless , and said to myself , There is nothing surprising in this . There is nothing surprising in this . ' Everything had gone dark before my eyes . My heart seemed to have stopped beating . Marie laughed and the sound of her cracking , high-pitched laugh came to me from far off . The officer said something to her , and she stopped abruptly as if some one had clapped a hand over her mouth . What did he say ? ' I managed to articulate . . My own language seemed to have deserted me . He says it is a matter for tears , not laughter . ' Her voice was sharp and anxious . I was relieved at the spite and vanity in his words . They made the situation more normal . I felt myself breathing again , and my stomach began to tremble uncontrollably . Janchu began to cry from the bedroom , and Marie got up to go to him . Quickly a plain-clothes man with horn-rimmed spectacles slipped in between her and the door . The officer who had now seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one leave the room , ' he said in German . But my baby is crying , ' Marie began . Let him cry ! ' And he busied himself pulling papers out of his portfolio . An army officer entered and spoke to the head of the secret service . He wore a dazzling , gold-braided uniform and preened himself before us , looking at us curiously over his shoulder . When he had gone , the head told us that we were to have a personal examination in the salon of the pension . A secret-service man escorted each of us , and we walked down the corridor , past the squad of soldiers with their bayonets , and so into the salon , where we were delivered into the hands of two women spies . They undressed us , and we waited while our clothes were passed out to the secret-service men outside . When we were given our clothes again , we went back to our apartment . The rooms were in confusion . All our trunks and bags were emptied , one end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The secret-service men were down on their knees before piles of clothes , going over the seams , emptying the pockets , unfolding handkerchiefs , tapping the heels of shoes ; every scrap of paper was passed over to the chief , who tucked it into his portfolio . I watched him , hating his square , stolid body which filled out his uniform so smoothly . His eyes were long and watchful like a cat 's , and his fair moustache was turned up at the ends , German-fashion ; in fact , there was something very German about his thick thighs and shaved head and official importance . As I have learned since , he is a German and the most bitterly hated man in Kieff for his pitiless persecution of all political offenders . They say that he has sent more people to Siberia than any six of his predecessors . They also say that every hand is against him , even to the spies in his own force . I trembled to spring at him and claw him and ruffle his composure some way . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched the spies ransacking our clothes . Every card and photograph I tried to catch a glimpse of before it went into the black portfolio . And suddenly I saw the letter about the Jewish detention camp , which I had forgotten all about . I saw the close lines of my writing , and it seemed as if the'edge of the precipice crumbled and I went shooting down . A cold sweat broke out over me . But why are we arrested ? ' I heard Marie ask in German . Espionage , ' the chief answered shortly . But that is ridiculous . We arc American citizens . ' No reply . Can we leave for Odessa to-night ? ' No reply . Marie stopped her questions . What money have you ? Come here while I count it , ' one of the spies said to me . He slipped me one hundred roubles on the sly , before turning the rest over to the chief . I held it openly in my hand , too dazed to know what to do with it , till he whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , later , ' he said . Frau Pierce will go with us , ' the chief said , closing his portfolio ; and I understood by this that the revision was finished . ' Frau G ? can stay here under room-arrest , with her little boy . ' As a matter of course , I went into the other room and changed into my traveling suit . ' May I take my toilet things ? ' I asked the chief . Ja . ' You 'd better make a bundle of bedclothes , ' the spy who had given me the money whispered to me . I rolled up two blankets and a pillow with his help . I 'm ready , ' I said . ' May I send a few telegrams ? ' Certainly , certainly . ' The chief 's manner suddenly became extremely courteous . I wrote one to our Ambassador in Petrograd , one to Mr. Vopeka in Bucharest , one to the State Department in Washington , and one to Peter . I wrote Peter that I was delayed a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be arrested , too . My hand did not tremble , although it struck me as being very queer to see the words traced out on the paper ? almost magical . My imagination was racing , and I could see myself already being driven into one of those baggage-cars bound for Tomsk . Keep your mind away from what is going to happen , ' I said to myself . You 'll have time enough to think in prison . Things are as they are . You are going to walk out of this room , just the way you 've done a hundred times . Are you different now from what you have always been ? Keep your mind on things you know are real . ' I tried to move accurately , as if a false move would disturb the balance of things so that I should walk out of the room on my hands like an acrobat . Suddenly , the chief , who had been talking in a corner with the other man in uniform , wheeled about . ' Frau Pierce may stay here under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bowed slightly . His spies clustered about him , and they left the room . All at once my bones seemed to crumble and my flesh to dissolve . I fell into a chair . Marie and I looked at each other . We began to laugh . ' We must n't get hysterical , ' we said , and kept on laughing . The room was so dark that we looked like two shadows . Panna Lolla had come after Janchu and taken him into Count S ' s room . We imagined the excited curiosity of the rest of the pension . I 'll wager that that woman was a spy , after all . ' But why why should we have a revision ? ' Anyway , they could n't have found much . We 'll be set free in a few days , ' Marie said . They found my letter about the Jews , ' I replied . What letter ? Oh , my dear , what did you say ? ' I forget . But everything I saw or heard , I think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our telegrams ? ' ? ' Will Peter come on ? ' ? What shall we do for money ? ' The room was pitch-dark except for the electric light from the street . We heard the creak and rattle of the empty commissariat wagons which were returning from the barracks . We all fell silent , feeling suddenly very tired and lethargic . Where is Janchu ? It 's time for his supper , ' Marie said , without moving . I started out of the room to call him , and fell across a dark figure sitting in front of the door . He grunted and pushed me back into the room . I want Janchu , ' I said in perfectly good English , while he closed the door in my face . There 's a spy outside our door , ' I whispered to Marie . Panna Lolla came in with Janchu and turned on the light . There 's a man outside our door , and two secret service men at the pension door , and two soldiers downstairs , ' she whispered excitedly in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they take the name and address of every one who comes here . And that woman was a spy . Antosha saw the chief go into her room and heard them talking together . And she left when they did . ' I lay all night , half-asleep , half-awake , hearing the street noises clearly through the open windows . I cried a little from exhaustion and nerves , and then controlled myself , for my head began to ache , and who knew what would happen the next day . I had to keep strength to meet something that was coming . I had no idea what it was , but the uncertainty of the future only made it more ominous and threatening . That letter In the darkness I could see the chief 's watchful , narrow eyes , and the horn-rimmed spectacles of the friendly spy , and the stuffed portfolio . Later Nothing has happened . yet . We have our meals brought to us by Antosha , WilD tries to comfort us with extra large pickled cucumbers and portions of sour cream . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarettes and books from the circulating library . Thank Heaven for books ! With our nerves stretched to the snapping-point and a pinwheel of thoughts everlastingly spinning round in our heads , I think we should go mad except for books . It is very hot , but my body is always cool and damp , because I ca n't eat much , I suppose , and I lie on a chaise longue motionless all day long . I can feel myself growing weak , and there is nothing to do but sit and wait . Marie and I go over and over the whole thing , and finish at the point where we began . ' But why ? ' We think it may be because Marie came to Bulgaria to visit me and brought me back here , and now we want to leave Russia together . The papers say that Bulgaria already hai German officers over her troops . But I ca n't believe it . She is too independent . They say that she will certainly go with the Central Powers . That , too , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and already known by the Russian authorities , the secret service is suspicious of our going back there , and of Marie 's intention of sailing home from Dedeogatch , via Greece . What else could it be ? How this uncertainty maddens us ! Yet we are thankful for every day that passes and leaves us together . What will happen when they translate my letter ? Boje moy ! I hear a step outside the door , and my heart simply ceases to beat . Pan Lzudesky to-day tiptoed into our room when the spy was having his lunch . He whispered to us that he had seen the English Consul , Mr. Douglas , and told him about our case . He begged us not to be discouraged , and to eat . He said that he almost wept when he saw our plates come back to the kitchen , untouched . How flabby and livid he looked , his vague , blurred eyes watery with tears ! Yet we could have embraced him . He is the only person who has spoken to us . October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility here in trying to find out where our passports are and who is to return them . We have already unraveled yards of red tape , and still there is no end . Of course , ever since Peter came he has followed a schedule of visits ? one day to the English Consul ; another day to the secret police , then to the Military Governor , the Civil Governor , the Chief of Staff , and back , in desperation , to the English Consul . There is an American vice-consul here , but he is wholly ineffectual since he has not yet been officially received . His principal duty consists in distributing relief to the Polish refugees . Mr. Douglas , the English Consul , is our one hope , and he is untiring in his efforts to help us . If we ever do get out it will be due to him . The English government stands behind its representatives here in a way ; the American State Department does not . I suppose that this is partly because America , has no treaty with Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate , one might just as well be a Fiji Islander as an American , for all the consideration one gets from officialdom . I went to the secret police the other day with Mr. Douglas . It is located in the opposite end of the town , down a quiet side street ? an unobtrusive , one-storied brown house that gives the impression of trying to hide itself from people 's notice . We rang the bell . While we waited , I was conscious of being watched , and glancing up quickly , I saw the curtain at one of the windows fall back into place . The door opened a crack , and a white face with a long , thin nose , and horn-rimmed spectacles with smoky glass to hide the eyes , peered out at us furtively . Mr. Douglas handed the spy his card and the door was shut softly in our faces . In about three minutes the door was opened again and a gendarme in uniform ushered us into a long room thick with stale tobacco-smoke . He gave me a chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the brightly colored portraits of the Czar and the Czarina and the Royal family , and the ikon in one corner . ' Give up all hope all ye who enter here . ' And then the chief came in , accompanied by two spies with black portfolios under their arms . When he saw us he grew white with anger . He looked like a German , spurred and booted , with square head and jaw and steel-like eyes and compressed , cruel lips . He was the only well-dressed one in the crowd , but his livery was the same as theirs . He was their superior , that was all ; and how I loathed him ! He 's angry because they brought us in here , ' Douglas whispered under his breath . The chief turned his back on us . The spies scribbled away furiously , their noses close to their paper , not daring to look up . We were taken into another room , a small back room , bare except for a table and sofa and a tawdry ikon in the farthest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute silence . How silent that house was , full of invisible horrors ! Suddenly the chief came into the room , closing the door carefully behind him . He was quite calm again . He looked at Douglas . ' What do you want ? ' Douglas explained how anxious we were to get out of Russia , how insufficient for cold weather was the money we had , how my husband 's business called for his immediate presence , and so forth , all of which we had gone over at least three times a week since my arrest , and all of which was a matter of entire indifference to the secret police . They had failed to find any proof of espionage , which was their charge against us , and my letter , their only evidence , had been passed on and was snarled up somewhere in official red-tape . Now they washed their hands of me . ' We can do nothing . It is out of our hands . ' He was extremely courteous , speaking German for my benefit . ' It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was obliged to send it on to the General Staff . You should have a reply soon . ' There was nothing more to be said . Douglas was conciliatory , almost ingratiating . My nerves gave way . A reply soon ! ' I burst out . ' I 'm sick of waiting . If we have the liberty of the city , surely there ca n't be anything very serious against us . It 's an outrage keeping our passports . I 'm an American and I demand them . ' I was almost crying . You must demand them through your ambassador , meine Frau . ' I knew that he knew that we had been telegraphing him since our arrest , and my impotence made me speechless with rage . Douglas took advantage of my condition to beat a hasty retreat . As we were going through the doorway , the chief said carelessly , ' By the way , how did you happen to find this house ? ' ' I have been here before , ' Douglas replied . ' Thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spies ' eyes on my back as we went down the path . ' Mrs. Pierce ? Mrs. Pierce , you must n't lose your temper that way . ' I do n't care ! ' I cried . ' I had no way to express what I felt . ' I know , ' Douglas agreed thoughtfully . October . I gained admittance to the Military Governor the other day . He is the successor of that over-cautious governor who prematurely moved all his household goods during the German advance , and was then relieved of office . His palace , set back from the street behind a tall iron fence , is guarded by soldiers with bayonets , and secret-service men . I laughed , recognizing my old friends the spies . Upstairs , the Governor was just saying good-bye to Bobrinsky , former Governor of Galicia , and we stood to one side as they came out of an inner office , bowing and making compliments to each other . Gold braid and decorations ! These days the military have their innings , to be sure ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up one of these men ? Or perhaps so much gold braid is paid for in other ways . The Governor was an old man , carefully preserved . His uniform was padded , but his legs , thin and insecure , gave him away , and his standing collar , although it came up to his ears , failed to hide his scrawny neck where the flesh was caving in . He wore his gray beard trimmed to a point , and inside his beak-like nose was a quantity of grayish-yellow hair which made a very disagreeable impression on me . All the time I was speaking he examined his nails . When he raised his eyes finally , to reply , I noticed how lifeless and indifferent they were , and glazed by age . I could see the bones of his face move under the skin as he talked , especially two little round bones , like balls , close to his ears . I have nothing to do with the case . It has been referred to the General Staff , I believe . You will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned his back , went over to the window and began to play with a curtain-tassel . An aide bowed me to the door . I am just back from the General Staff , where the mysterious rotation of the official wheel landed me unexpectedly into the very sanctum sanetorum of the Chief of the Staff , and to see him I had to wait only five hours with Mr. Douglas in the ante-room ! Mr. Douglas has just left me to go to his club , exhausted , and ready to devour pounds of Moscow sausages , so he said . The ante-room of the General Staff was as Russian as Russian can be . I suppose I shall never forget the dingy room , with its brown-painted walls and the benches and chairs ranged along the four sides of the room , and the orderlies bringing in glasses of tea , and the waiting people who were not ashamed to be unhappy . In the beginning Mr. Douglas and I tried to talk , but after an hour or so we relapsed into silence . I looked up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . At first , they all looked fat and stupid and alike in the huge , ornate gilt frames . But after much study they began to take on differences ? slight differences which it seemed that the painters had caught in spite of themselves , but which made human beings of even generals . Shortly afterward , Douglas and I were admitted to the Chief of Staff . // The walls of his office were covered with large maps , with tiny flags marking the battle-fronts , and he sat at a large table occupying the centre of the room . When we entered he rose and bowed , and after waving me to a chair , re-seated himself . He was rather like a university professor , courteous , with a slightly ironical twist to his very red lips . His pale face was narrow and long , with a pointed black beard , and a forehead broad and high and white . While he listened or talked , he nervously drew arabesques on a pad of paper on the table . ' I have your petition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not very familiar with routine matters . ' Here he smiled slightly . ' Yours is a routine matter , I should say . How long have you waited for an answer ? four months ? We 'll see what can be done . I have sent to the files and I should have a report in a few minutes . ' An aide brought in a collection of telegrams and papers , and the Chief glanced through them . Then he looked at me searchingly and suddenly smiled again . From your appearance I should never imagine that you were as dangerous as these papers state . Are you an American ? ' Yes , ' I replied , ' and I assure you that I am dangerous only in the official mind . I have no importance except what they give me . ' Mrs. Pierce is an American and unused to Russian ways , ' Douglas said apologetically . Well , your case has been referred to General Ivanoff and I will wire him again at once . If you come back next Thursday I will give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a gray , winter day , with a cold wind from the river , but I felt glowing and stimulated and alive , seeing the future crystallize and grow definite again . You ca n't imagine the wearing depression of months of uncertainty . That Chief of Staff is the first human official I 've met , ' I said to Douglas . ' Give him time , give him time , ' Douglas replied . ' Did n't you hear him say he was new to the job ? ' November . At home I found a summons from the police to appear with Marie at the local police bureau to-morrow at nine , to receive our passports . I telegraphed Peter through Douglas . Now that our affair is settled I feel no emotion ? neither relief nor joy .
