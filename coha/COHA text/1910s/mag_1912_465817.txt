SUPPOSE that ten or twenty years ago some one , not too high in the seats of authority , should have written of the endless maladies which plague the human race in a fashion like this : " Disease is a kind of substance ? for all practical purposes almost as definite as water , and like water having a considerable variety in its composition and effect . Thus as water varies from the brine of the ocean and the salts of the mineral springs to the almost chemically pure springs whose crystal liquid often acts as a violent poison , so the substance we call disease attacks now one tissue , now another , showing itself at one time as a fever , another as a slow wasting , and so on . And just as the total quantum , of water on the surface of the earth may vary owing to the variations of the rainfall , so the quantum of disease may show some variations , but probably over bread periods remains at a nearly constant level . Like water again , this substance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some great , some small , and flows from these through definite channels over the habitable lands to harass and cripple mankind . " Twenty years or more ago such ideas would have been looked upon as near lunacy . Even now , and even by the larger part of the great army which all over the earth is , as we say , fighting disease , they would be regarded as highly figurative speech . Yet if we put together all that we know of the sources and the nature of infection and try to picture how these sources have been perennially replenished , through thousands and tens of thousands of years , we shall see that such a concept is not a metaphor , but very close to reality . Ideas often come to us in strange ways . When , half a century ago , Dr. David Livingstone went to South Africa as medical missionary among the Bechuana. probably he had little thought of becoming the pioneer in the opening-up of the Dark Continent . Infinitely less probably did he dream that his explorations would finally bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a humble practitioner , and that from the consideration of one of his earliest discoveries should come new ideas as to how contagions are kept alive . A strange thing that Dr. Livingstone found was a wide belt in the equatorial regions in which domestic animals ? horses , cows , beasts of burden , dogs , etc. ? were almost non-existent . The reason for this became clear enough as soon as Livingstone and his party attempted to cross this belt with their own animals . The latter sickened and died under the sting of a fly . This was the now famous tsetse-fly , cousin to and closely resembling our common stable-fly , which often causes so much discomfort just before a rain , when it is said that " the flies are biting . " These insects made of this belt almost a desert so far as mammals are concerned . Dr. Livingstone and those who followed in his footsteps for a long time considered this fatal issue to be the direct result of a poisoned bite , like a snake 's . So long as there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious mystery . It was different when , half a century later , Colonel Bruce , an English physician , went to Africa to work upon the " fly disease , " or nagana , as it is known among the natives , and found that the bite of the fly is in itself as harmless , let us say , as the chance playful bite of a pet dog . Like the dog , the tsetse-fly is deadly only when it is itself infected . What Colonel Bruce found was that the disease is due to the entry into the body of microscopic little wrigglers with a corkscrew-like motion , and called for that reason trypanosama , or " boring bodies . " These minute wrigglers swarm in the blood of the cattle , horses , dogs , etc. that are infected , and are sucked out when the fly drives his sharp-edged little pump through the skin in search of his daily bread . In the fly the wrigglers undergo a stage of development just as the yellow-fever and malaria germs do in the body of the mosquito , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another and perhaps healthy animal , upon which the fly may alight in quest of his provender . The fly is thus the unwitting and perhaps the unwilling host , and nothing more . But now consider these two further facts . Practically all of the domestic animals which are bitten die . But there is no evidence that the tsetse-fly lives to a much greater age than the ordinary fly , nor , on the other hand , that it can transmit the infection to its offspring , as do the pestiferous ticks in spotted fever , Texas fever , and the like . To keep up the infection the fly must feed constantly upon live animals whose blood is reeking with the trypanosomes . But if the disease itself destroys that supply , how can the infection remain alive , as it were , through all the years ? It was the consideration of this problem , here formulated more sharply than had ever been the case in any European epidemic ; which forced investigators to look for a concealed reserve supply , or . ; reservoir , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note about disease is how it will strike down one man and leave another , how it will strike one breed and leave another , how , for example , pneumonia is deadly for mice and not for rats . The one is susceptible ; the other is , as we say , " immune . " More strangely still , it is found that some breeds and some animals , and even some persons , may harbor the germs of a given infection without any disagreeable effects . They become carriers and " reservoirs . " In the case of the fly disease , or nagana , it was thought that these harborers were the wild antelopes and other animals of Africa . The blood of perfectly healthy animals was sometimes loaded with the trypanosomes , and yet there was no evidence of any great mortality from this cause . As these animals exist in great troops , here , then , seemed literally a vast fund or store of trypanosoma upon which the tsetse-fly might draw and then carry its devastating blight to animalswhich did succumb to the invasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are really implicated is still a matter of doubt . But that such a reservoir must exist seems clear . There is much to suggest that what is true of nagana , in all its forms , is more or less true also of its first cousin , the horrible " sleeping sickness " which little by little has come to be known as the great scourge of tropical Africa . Here , however , the duration of the disease is much longer , and although the termination has been nearly always fatal , the months and even years during which the persons infected with this malady may go about their work and mingle with their kind serve to provide a great human reservoir for the dissemination of the disease . Dating usually from a severe attack of fever ? " Gambian fever , " as it was called for a time ? the blood of the victims in sleeping sickness is found to contain a trypanosome very much resembling the minute bodies found in fly disease ; and , as is now well known , the disease is usually carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was for a time supposed that it was carried exclusively by a single variety of the tsetse , Glossina palpitans , and not by G. monyitans , which is the usual infective agent in nagana , but later researches have implicated not only the latter , but the mosquito as well . Outside of the great human reservoir of the sleeping-sickness parasite , it seems probable that there are others , conceivably of vast extent . Following his work on this disease , Dr. Koch put forward the view that the crocodile was perhaps the chief great storehouse outside of man , and that the destruction of the crocodiles and the careful herding of the infected natives might do a great deal toward reducing the prevalence of the disease . For it is obvious that the extermination of the tsetse itself is now , and probably for a long time will be , a superhuman task . The fly exists in almost incalculable numbers , and probably little headway could be made toward its riddance until tropical Africa has been repopulated with a fly-hating race . The problem here , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mosquito , the extermination of the carrier , but its sterilization , and , so far as possible , the reduction of the reservoirs from which the supply of disease germs is drawn . We have a malady in North America which if it had ever become very widely disseminated might have presented a problem almost as difficult for us as the sleeping sickness for Africa . That is the curious disease known as Rocky Mountain fever . This likewise is a plague of the ticks , and here again is the now famous " third host . " It appears that the great reservoir of the contagion is the ground-squirrels , chipmunks , and similar rodents of the Rocky Mountain States . It is only incidentally that the ticks leave the animals and assail our human kind . It is possible that dogs and other domestic animals to some extent act as the carriers , not of the germs , but of the ticks , from the rodents to man . The relapsing or recurrent fevers , varying in form with the continent which is their theater , appear likewise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the African variety already mentioned , Gambian fever , or trypaiiosomiasis , which now appears to be the first stage of the sleeping sickness . But here we meet with a new variety of " storage . " It is of interest to know that in the case of the first and best-studied of the tick maladies , the Texas cattle fever , it was found that some of the cattle appeared to acquire a certain immunity , and that it was rather in the freshly imported cattle that the disease assumed its most virulent form . But it was found that this immunity was not due in any way to a freedom from the germs of the disease . On the contrary , many of the healthy animals were found carrying the pear-shaped organism , or piroplasma , as it is on this account called , in great numbers . This pear - like delicacy is drawn out of these animals by the bloodsucking ticks , and carried by them to other animals which have not acquired those peculiar blood substances that apparently confer protection . In other words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way to make the piroplasmas harmless to certain brands of cattle in order that the piroplasmas might have a safe and secret place of refuge , so that if , for example , ruthless man might come along and for his own reasons attempt to exterminate the infected cattle , the disease might still be preserved . But , to pursue a little further the old language of the " argument from design , " it would seem that the ingenuity of nature had not stopped here . In the case of mosquitoes , fleas , and many other carriers of disease , and likewise in the case of man himself , the germs which they harbor are not transmitted by these organisms to their progeny . Here , as in man , hereditary disease is practically unknown . But in the case of the ticks the reverse is true , so much so that it is the second generation of ticks , deriving the disease germs from their parents , which seem the active agents of inoculation to the cattle they attack . The successive generations of ticks therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessory reservoirs to assist benevolent Nature in its endeavor to keep the price of beef as high as possible . While dwelling upon Nature 's marvels it might be worth while to recount one curious instance where another form of adaptation has directly contributed to the maintenance of a contagion . This is a protozoal disease of rats . The transmitter in this case is not a tick , but a blood-sucking mite . The latter derives its infection by pumping into its stomach the blood of diseased rats , but here the direct exchange of germs from rodent to mite appears to cease . There is no evidence that healthy rats in turn become infected by the bite , but rather by eating the mites themselves ! The rats appear to regard them as a delicacy . Here the rat is the victim , the mite the reservoir . But in the deadliest contagion known to man it is the rat which is the chief reservoir , man the victim . This is the bubonic plague . Over wide areas the disease appears to be chronic in rats , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same agent as that which carries the malady to man ? namely , the familiar flea , so long tolerated as a harmless and often amoosin ' little cuss ! It is one of the marvels of human obtusity that the ' bubonic plague has flourished as long as it has , for the concurrence of the rat with the appearance of the epidemic has been known certainly for thousands of years . One might have supposed therefore that a war upon rats , not a procedure of enormous difficulty , would have been almost the first of protective measures against the oncoming of the contagion . It needed no knowledge either of germs or antitoxins to develop and , in the hands of Jenner , to perfect our prophylaxis against smallpox . It is to be said , however , that the bubonic form of the plague is in itself only one manifestation , and that possibly its greatest ravages have been when it has assumed the so-called pneumonic form , and this has tended immensely to complicate the problem . Furthermore , it is possible that the rat is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Manchuria it appears that the carrier may have been the little tarbagan , which is sought at certain seasons of the year by great numbers of coolie hunters . Nevertheless , it somehow seems as if the new ideas of disease storage ought not to seem as new as they do . Thus , for example , anthrax is familiarly a disease of cattle and sheep , and is relatively rare in man ? so rare , indeed , that it is evidently through animals rather than man that the disease is kept alive . In a similar way it was long ago clear that trichinosis came from infected hogs , and that the hog was literally the reservoir in this instance . And still more obvious was the case of a disease that must be nearly as old as the human race itself , for man must very early have domesticated dogs and perhaps cats as well . This is hydrophobia . An outbreak of this disease in an animal is usually like an explosion . Where the animal comes in contact with man it does not , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or at best a day or two , after it has , as we say , " gone mad , " before it is promptly killed . The microbe which produces the virus that breeds this insanity is still unknown , but it has long been clear that the disease is transmitted only by a bite , or , in some very rare cases , by licking a hand where there may be a scratch of the skin . It was equally obvious that healthy animals acquire the disease in some definite way , and plain observation must have shown that this way is simply by being bitten . Now if the mad dog or cat has been promptly destroyed . as it usually is , itis quite equally difficult to understand bow the disease could have been perpetuated unless there was some source of reserve . Primitive man was a hunter and a close observer , and must often have seen cases of " mad " wolves , foxes , and the like , and if he had not been given over to every variety of superstition , from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have realized that the virus must be maintained by means of the wild animals . He would have had here a splendid basis from which to build up a general theory of contagion . So , too , it must have been clear that the virus of itch mites , once so prevalent but now happily disappearing , must have had some other haven of refuge than man himself , and some other carrier , in order that they might live and be as widely disseminated as they once were . Here again very slight observation would have put the domestic animals , especially pets , under suspicion . To these familiar examples has recently been added another of a different type . This is the obscure malady long known as Malta fever , but now better known as Mediterranean fever . It has recently made its appearance in our Southern States . That this is frequently a disease of goats ' milk is now established ; that is , that the unknown germ of the disease is carried by goats , is distributed by the goats ' milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goats often suffices to terminate the outbreak . But around the most wide-spread of all human contagions obscurity still reigns . Recent discoveries in the field of tuberculosis , so far from clearing up its problems , seem to have done precisely the reverse ; so that in spite of much textbook and legendary wisdom its transmission and hence its reserve sources are still largely conjecture . This is due in large part to certain features of the disease which only recently have come to light or found clear confirmation . One of these is the length of time which may elapse between the infection and the appearance of any symptoms of the malady . This may be years and apparently even decades . Another is that the chief period of infection lies in childhood if not in infancy . And a third is the universality of the disease . Two decades ago the civilized world was shocked to learn that . as careful autopsies showed , practically no one who had reached the age of thirty had escaped an attack of tuberculosis . Later investigation served to increase the amazement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now new work , especially by Vienna investigators , lowers the limit age to fourteen and even less . It has been the especial merit of Hamburger to show that the percentage of children attainted rises steadily with the years , so that at twelve years of age more than ninety per cent . show indisputably the marks of invasion . This he has established by the double proof of revealing the actual evidence of the disease in autopsies , and , second , by the use of the now well-known tuberculin reaction , which as a test is of exceeding delicacy . But these results of Hamburger and his fellow-workers appear to set merely an upper limit to the period of primary infection . How far back of this it may reach we have at present simply no idea . This is clear from the work of Harbitz in Christiania , and of Weichselbaum and Bartels in Vienna , which has shown that the neck , bronchial , and mesenteric glands of very young children may be apparently free from every trace of tuberculosis and likewise of the bacillus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injected in guinea-pigs , the latter often develop the disease . These cases for the most part escape the delicate tuberculin test , and there is therefore nothing but the inoculation test to reveal the presence of the disease . Now consider that in the results of Hamburger and others more than half of the children at five years of age show clear signs of the invasion , and put with this the fact that most of these cases may have taken some years to develop , and it would seem as if the contention of Von Behring , that the beginnings of consumption are in infancy and in the period when the child is largely fed upon milk , would prove to be the reality . If this were the case , then the " milk question " ? that is , the bovine origin of human tuberculosis , which seemed largely settled in the negative ? would have its day in court again . For this is clear , that in spite of the universality of the disease , the number of " open " or virulent human cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small ; in any event , it seems difficult to believe it sufficiently large so that one-half of the children could be infected directly by human means before five years of age . That our human kind represents one great reservoir of the disease probably admits of no question . Certainly this is true as regards what Hamburger styles the " tertiary stage , " of which phthisis , or " consumption , " is the familiar type ? that is , the more typically adult form of the malady . Such at least is the present-day supposition among competent inquirers . But even this supposition may prove wholly or in part ungrounded . In the light of present-day knowledge it seems clear that the tuberculosis of adults and adolescents is a secondary or reinfection , and owes its virulence to the fact that the soil has been prepared by the primary infection of childhood ; for while it does seem that the attacks of childhood , especially when repeated , confer a certain immunity , this latter is dearly paid for if the reinfection be sufficiently severe . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allergy , and means that a light infection may in some cases confer immunity , while in others it sensitizes the body so that even a mild secondary infection may have the most disastrous results . Another phase of the matter is that the outbreaks of acute tuberculosis seem largely consecutive to an attack of scarlet fever , measles , or some other similar contagion ? that is , they seem often the direct result of a " cross-infection . " The chronic or long-standing malady often seems " precipitated " by the intervention of some mild fever or the like . It may readily be , therefore , that even the reinfection of adolescents and adults may be due , not so much to association with the human carrier , but rather to a flaring-up of a smoldering " hearth , " or focus , as the doctors say ; and that contact with human carriers may have relatively little to do with the perpetuation of this great scourge . Perhaps this is as yet only a possibility . But meanwhile it is to be noted that many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have fallen to the ground . This at least is clear , that the most delicate laboratory reactions , the so-called agglutination and opsonic tests , fail to reveal any difference between the tubereule bacillus of cows and of human beings . An animal inoculated with the human bacillus may react equally well against the virus of either the cattle or the human type . Next , both may be experimentally so transformed as practically to reverse the characteristics which are supposed to distinguish them . In other words , it is possible to obtain cultures of the human bacillus which are as virulent or more virulent for cattle than any which can be derived from the cattle themselves . And , reversely , the typical cattle bacillus may be cultivated in such a fashion as to become as poisonous for the human organism as any of the so-called human strains . And , finally , the virulence of both varieties may be so reduced ? attenuated , as we say ? as to cause their characteristic reactive powers to disappear . In a word , there is little in present-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different types of the same variety . If this needed any further confirmation , it would lie in the fact that such slender degree of immunity as may be established by the tubercular virus may be set up equally well by the one as by the other . There no longer seems to be any doubt that Von Behring was right in his contention that our human kind may be and to some extent is infected from tuberculous cattle . The question is as to the extent . It is only a year or so ago that investigators came to a sharp consciousness of the main incidence of the disease ? namely , that it is upon the little children . Now that we know this , the whole direction of inquiry will change , and we may hope speedily to bring amelioration to a malady for which no serum or specific has yet been found , and which the much-vaunted sanatoria seem merely to palliate rather than to cure . Just as our ideas of tuberculosis have had to undergo within a few years a complete volte-face , so have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cholera and typhoid . I have VOL . CXXV , ? No. 780. - 104spoken a little as if the reservoir theory of disease was entirely new . In reality it is old enough . The fact that there must exist some means or places of storage probably was clear to the first of men who reflected seriously upon the problem . But it is one of the mysteries of the human mind that here , as in countless other cases , instead of building upon some sure fact near at hand , as , for example , some clear case like hydrophobia or some of the skin diseases , men gave free rein to the imagination . Doubtless it is easier to fancify ( phantasieren , as the Germans say ) than toilsomely to weld together the available facts . So when the Evil Spirit theory had died away it was the malignant miasms and the deadly night air and infected food and infected clothing which came in its stead . And , finally , when this in its turn had begun to dwindle into twilight , came the filth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revelation of the mosquito and other biting insects as disease-carriers has forever purged the anciently mephitic air ; we now know that night air or swamp air is as pure and wholesome as any other provided we have screens . Along with the miasms went the fomites theory ? the yellow-fever blanket and the scarlet-fever ribbon and all their kindred . But typhoid and cholera still came down the river , and ran thence into the milkcans as familiarly as of old . All this despite the example of the German professors who drank enough cholera bacilli to destroy a regiment , and typhoid epidemics that occur despite water-supplies and dairies which are marvels of cleanliness . It is now known that typhoid is primarily a blood infection , that it may run its course with no intestinal manifestations whatever , that , indeed , one of its not uncommon forms is the " pneumonic , " and that in any event the bacillus usually appears in the blood stream before any intestinal symptoms develop . This latter fact is indeed the basis of the new " typhoid tests , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had time to show its familiar colors . Analogy would suggest that the same is probably true of cholera , although this is not as yet firmly established . But it is almost certainly true in the case of ordinary lobar pneumonia , where the familiar pneumococcus seems the principal agent of the disturbance . Indeed , it is possible that almost all of what physicians love to call the exenthemata , or " flowering diseases " ? that is , the eruptive fevers ? must he primarily blood infections , and there are a few venturesome minds who would go so far as to say that this is true of all diseases whatsoever . Be this as it may , what has come out of the mass of new work and investigation , which has often involved the expenditure of almost incredible effort , is that the pneumocoecus , the plague bacillus , the diphtheria bacillus , and countless others are to be found in the mouths and nasal cavities of the great majority of healthy people . It seems fairly clear that in typhoid , cholera , smallpox , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other maladies , one main carrier is the healthy human body , and one main reservoir the healthy human being . It would be absurd to put forward this latter view as a finality , though it is just now gaining great vogue . There is , to begin with , a very great difficulty in understanding how the disease is transmitted from the healthy carrier to his victim , for the simple reason that the mucous membrane which lines the throat , nose , and lungs is more or less antiseptic , and even the direct smearing of the bronchial tubes of sheep , for example , failed to infect the animals with pneumonia , although they are normally extremely susceptible . In the case of insect-carried contagions and hydrophobia and familiar skin diseases , the mechanism of infection is perfectly clear , and in view of the rapid advance of our knowledge in this field , and the fact that this is the only method of transmission which is experimentally known , a certain reserve toward the healthy human-carrier theory is not unreasonable . But where direct contact exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sure , that more deadly disease has been carried by promiscuous kissing than by all the infected milk-supplies or watersupplies or drains or foods or oysters that ever existed . This is especially true as regards the infernal and disgusting practice of " kissing the baby . " How any sane mother can expose a child wantonly to every disease that may be afloat , knowing well the facts , is beyond human comprehension ; and yet this abominable custom appears to be almost a social rite . The day when this practice is done away with will probably see infant mortality drop by at least one-half . I have alluded in another paper to the curious observation that in Massachusettts , last year , an epidemic of hog paralysis preceded an outbreak of infantile paralysis . It is still but a suggestion that our domestic pigs may be the reservoir for this devastating contagion , but it is in line with all the sure knowledge we have gained in the last quarter of a century , and if the intermediary between the host and the child victim be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common biting stable-fly , we should have another disease where a sure prophylaxis would be as simple to set up as in malaria or yellow fever . Meanwhile , Uhlenhuth and his coworkers have shown that the intestines of pigs and also of calves contain normally quantities of bacilli that can not be distinguished from the group which in humans cause the typhoid-like " paratyphoid " and " enteritis " and the familiar " food-poisoning " cases . These bacilli tend to invade the organs and meat of the animals as soon as they are killed , although the animals show no signs of disease while living , or outwardly when killed . Perchance this may clear up a series of obscure maladies , and if so , the need of careful meat-inspection will be obvious , let us hope , even to a politician . All of which illustrates vividly enough how great has been our ignorance , how recent our knowledge of the reality . Out of it all emerges this much of clear fact : the reservoirs of disease are living reservoirs ; the lowly organisms which cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living host is brief , and , so far as we can see , almost negligible . The nightmare of disease germs everywhere , in books and brooks , and through all the ambient air , need plague us no more . It is our fellow-man and our pets , and the disease-spreading insects and vermin , that we should learn to fear .
