 | SALESMANSHIP is the science of service ; the knack of knowing people 's wants ; the art of turning money into friendship ; the business of making the world better and getting paid for doing it . The good salesman is the great civilizer ? whether we buy neater shoes or sweeter pianos , we are indebted to the salesman for another slice of civilization . No matter what we resolve to do , have or be , there are invaluable aids that we must first buy . Every successful man is a salesman . The doctor sells prescriptions , the teacher sells instructions , the lawyer sells consultations , the banker sells credits , the farmer sells crops , the preacher sells sermons , the inventor sells ideas . Anybody old enough to be a citizen must be either a salesman or a tramp . More than half the population of any country is engaged in selling something . There are about 60,000 , - 000 people in the United States who try to exchange a commodity or a service for money or its equivalent ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest bungle their job . Every college and high school should teach the student how to do his best work , then how to sell it for the best price . Learning void of earning is spurious education , and no institution of learning deserves the name until it shows every graduate how to find a good market for his life product . We are not interested in moneymaking , apart from something more valuable . If the main object in salesmanship were money-making , it would not be discussed here . But salesmanship is the master-key to a large success in any trade or profession . And the very people who need most to grasp it are the ones who never consider it ? the faithful , conscientious philanthropic workers who gibe good service and starve on poor pay . The teacher able to fill a better place but not to find it ; the doctor skilled and devoted , but modest and uncommercial ; the preacher too old to be a pastor , but just old enough to be a counselor and guide ; the inventor , philosopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too rare and fine to seek the suffocating shambles ; the tireless , uncomplaining housewife and mother doing the work of three men and deprived of the salary of one ? these are a few of the splendid altruists who for the sake of justice and decency ought to learn how to comrriand better pay ! Salvation to the unselfish lies in salesmanship . You ca n't be fair to the other fellow without being fair to yourself . In so brief an article we are limited to the sphere of the professional salesman . But most of the principles here suggested apply to your work , whatever it may be ; and by adopting these . truths wisely , you should increase your income whether salary , fees or profits . To reach your maximum of prosperity and usefulness , you must be an expert salesman , or be allied with an expert salesman . There are ten basic factors in scientific salesmanship : the man , the motive , the method , the product , the price , the maker , the buyer , the sale , the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a service should study these ten fundamentals fairly and fully . THE MAN HE must have both instinct and training for the work . One of my numerous objections to poets is their lofty assumption that they , forsooth , are " born , not made . " Every good workman is both born and made ? born to his kind of work ? then made to his quality . The ordinary clerk in -a store is neither born nor bred for his job ? and the store-keeper wonders why times are so hard . Among the natural qualifications of the good salesman are these : Health , tact , courtesy , reliability , loyalty , enthusiasm , helpfulness , alertness , judgment , foresight , courage , confidence , persistence , accuracy , patience , good humor , sympathy , neatness , economy , regularity , sincerity , gameness , pleasing voice , conversational power , attractive appearance , friendly but deferential manner ? enjoyment of work , tireless industry . Among the vocational acquirements of the good salesman are these : Knowledge of human nature , knowledge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product , scientific team-work , familiarity with modern merchandising methods , acquaintance with new developments in advertising and selling , care of stock , handling of customers , frequent conferences , tabulation and comparison of reports , improvement the daily watchword , greater profit the final result but better service the first aim of all endeavor . About one man in every hundred may become a good salesman ; if you are an employer of salesmen , how do you eliminate the other ninetynine ? How , moreover , do you find and train the one ? Almost any business could increase its profits thirty per cent or more by adopting a scientific system of employing , training and managing the salesforce . THE MOTIVE WHY sell anything ? To make money ? No . You are a failure if you do n't make money , but a worse failure if that is all you do . The ultimate reason for every commercial transaction is to give something worth more than money , that money can not buy . Every customer is a good friend or a poor customer . Gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority on selling declares you need not expect to make a sale while you have the moneythought in your mind . You can always sell to the man who knows you will serve him , and you should not sell to any other man . Recently the head of a great insurance company died . His daughter , hardly more than a girl , with no business experience , took his place ? and the foolish wiseacres foretold quick ruin ! The girl not only held the business together , she largely increased the profits in the first year . She gives her principal rule of success : " I always try to benefit the customer , without regard to my fee . " Enthusiasm for the quality of your product , the reputation of your company , the satisfaction to the customer from the sale , the service to the customer on the side , and finally a just and generous money award to yourself ; here is the true motive in salesmanship . THE METHOD THIS may be by advertisement , by appointment , by special introduction , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of several other means of approach . Time and place are as crucial as method ? when is your prospective customer in the best humor , when has he the most time and money , where would he be likely to be seen ? The varieties of method must be learned both theoretically and practically ? every clerk in a business should buy and study one or more books on merchandising , advertising , speaking , business psychology , commercial correspondence ; and should take a mail course in modern salesmanship from an expert or institution of recognized authority .  | THE PRODUCT IS it guaranteed ? Is it the best of its kind ? Has it ever failed to give satisfaction ? If so , why ? And how are you preventing a recurrence of complaint ? When rival products meet it in a fair field , does yours always win out ? Would you sell it in preference to any other , even if the other brought a larger commission or salary ? Does it meet a universal need ? Is it advertised properly , so your work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know evert step in its manufacture ? Have you studied and disproved the claims of all your competitors ? A few score of questions like these , analyzing your product and your relation to it , should augment your influence and extend your sales . THE PRICE EVER be satisfied to charge exactly what your competitor does for the same article or service . Always give ( a ) better quality , or ( b ) larger quantity , or ( c ) lower price , or ( d ) supplemental value . A standard price on a standard product may always be apparently reduced to the customer by offering more for his money thru a supplemental value whose actual cost may be trifling . Examples of a supplemental value : A national seedman gives to the customer a booklet showing new ways of selecting and cooking vegetables ; a great life insurance company gives a perennial subscription to a health magazine ; a commercial school gives a text blank enabling the prospective student to judge the worth of any school in that line ; a periodical for mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts on all problems relating to motherhood , and the home ; a high school gives a series of talks on vocational guidance , wherein the pupils are told by successful men how to reach the top of a trade or profession . A sale or a service is really incomplete without an occasional extra value , that the customer does not pay for , and was not looking for . The good effect is even more of psychology than of economy . THE MAKER IN a factory or office building you may frequently observe a sign like this : " No Pedlers , Tramps or Beggars allowed . " Most people wear a sign like this in their mind , they flash it on the unknown salesman , they put him in their mental catalog with tramps and beggars . One of the quickest ways to rout this hostile feeling is to represent a firm nationally known , liked and trusted . I would rather sell shoestrings for a man whose name is a household word than sell automobiles for a man whose name is a moral cipher . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , he gets no further than the door ; but if he represents a famous concern ? no matter what he sells ? I feel morally bound , by the moral standing of his company , to give the man at least a hearing . An old salesman may succeed with a young concern , but a young salesman should sell for an old concern . Has the institution whose product you sell the highest reputation of any of the kind in your community ? Both your salesheet and your self-respect wait for the answer . THE BUYER HE should be studied , like a chessboard or a battlefield . He should be humored , like a child or a crazy person . He should be followed , challenged , outwitted , overcome . Yet , strange to tell and impossible to perform , he should be respected , consulted , obeyed , esteemed and helped with your deepest feeling toward him friendly and your every move honest . The majority of lost  | sales are a psychological reflex from an offense , usually unconscious , by the seller against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to impress the customer favorably , apart from the sale . Your dress , your manner , your walk , your facial expression , your tone of voice , your subconscious feeling , your choice of words , your evident mastery of the science of selling , your tact and courtesy joined with truth and sincerity ? all these and many more factors , understood and applied , predispose the customer in your favor without regard to what you sell . The dean of traveling men in America is eighty-nine years old ? and still on the job ; has been a salesman for seventy years and has sold 57,000 windmills in thirty-two years ? a world 's record . He attributes most of his success to the fact that he never offends a buyer , but always tries to be as thoro a gentleman as if entertaining the buyer in his own home . Is the man you try to sell to always sorry when he ca n't buy ? sorry because he likes and respects you so much ? If not , you are a poor salesman ; find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conduct and completion of the sale must be learned from experts , in books or courses on salesmanship . Treatment of the sale needs a volume to itself . The rash clerk who supposes that salesmanship is merely handing out and talking up goods to a customer grievously errs . The progress of the sale depends on ( a ) character of the goods ; ( b ) knowledge of the goods ; ( c ) analysis and description of the goods ; ( d ) fitness of the salesman to sell the goods ; ( e ) location of the buyer ; ( f ) introduction to the buyer ; ( g ) knowledge of the nature , habits and needs of the buyer ; ( h ) approach to the buyer ; ( i ) presentation to the buyer ; ( j ) anticipation of questions , interruptions or objections ; ( k ) completion of the sale , by cash or signature of the buyer ; ( 1 ) satisfaction of the buyer , both immediate and ultimate . Besides these major points , there are scores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckon with . Suppose , for example , under caption ( d ) you want to sell something big , where the service and the profit are worth while , and you do n't know whether to choose pianos or threshing-machines . If you love music , if you wear fine raiment with delight and distinction , if your best friends are women , if your brain-center of inhabitiveness is large , if your sentiment is stronger than your logic ? sell pianos . But if you were brought up on a farm and know how much a farmer needs good machinery , if you possess mechanical skill , and a liking for the whirr of the wheels , if you are a " man 's man , " sell threshing-machines . Failure to sell is primarily failure to be interested in what you have to sell . Another cardinal point is knowledge of the buyer , which only a scientific study of character analysis will provide . What motive will prompt him when he buys ? What reason , or what emotion , will he follow ? I have in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as a plunger and a " good sport " ; the second is proud of his reputation for caution , closeness and conservatism ; ? appeal to the gambler in the first , but to the miser in the second , and you make a sale ; reverse the method and you make two cordial enemies , with every chance of a sale now or hereafter gone to Mexico . The sequence in every sale is uniform , with five steps : attention , attraction , deliberation , conviction , action . But the way in which these five steps are taken differs with each buyer ; and in lieu of twenty or thirty years of actual knowledge of buyers , the only substitute is a thoro training in the art of salesmanship by a corps of experts in manufacture , psychology , advertising , trade , merchandising , efficiency and finance . THE SERVICE A FUNDAMENTAL desire to please , accommodate and help is the life of real salesmanship . The other day I went shopping for a suitcase . I knew exactly what I wanted . The clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grunted , looked sour , left me to depart in a state of much relief at escaping his presence . The clerk in the second store said he had something just as good , tried to sell me a cheap counterfeit , and put a harrowing strain on my nerves , as I wanted violently to seize him and eject himfromthestore-business . The clerk in the third store said he knew just what I wanted , would soon have a limited bargain sale on the very suitcase I described , and would telephone me as soon as the goods arrived , so I could have first choice ! In that one sentence he revealed , or concealed , five kinds of special consideration or service . Furthermore , in the conversation he discovered that I wanted certain facts on a different line of goods altogether ; whereupon he took the trouble to get the facts and give them to me . What happened ? I was sure I could find my suit-case by walking a few blocks further ; but this salesman , having only a promise to sell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waited days and days for that telephone message . And the suit-case was just what I wanted . First law of salesmanship : Offer a service apart from the sale , and if possible before the sale . The man who hires the clerks for a chain of a thousand stores ? the largest corporation of its kind in the world , and the mightiest ever known , says this : " Every clerk of ours has got to build up a personal following , to make record sales . " And you build up a personal following by studying hbw to render a personal service to each customer wherever possible . THE FUTURE OF course you want " repeat " orders ? tho I do n't like the word , it sounds commercial , flippant and unfriendly , along with the words " prospect " and " selling talk " and " size him up " and " tie him down " and other slang terms of pseudosalesmanship . Now future business goes back to a system of right relationship between the buyer and the seller , the seller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manufacturer and the dealer in raw materials . Do you know that the cost of your product or service has been cut to the lowest notch , without lowering the quality ? Are all the employers contented ? Is provision made for the steady advancement of each , and more pay for better work ? Will the demand for what you sell be greater , a year from now , then years from now , or can something else take its place ? Have you studied out all possible ways of increasing profits , to the manufacturer or your employer , and to yourself ? Could you sell to your regular customers anything they needed , simply on the basis of their confidence in you ? Are you so well known to leading members of your trade or profession that if you lost your present job , others would be offered you by successful institutions ? Have you set a figure on the ultimate value of your time and work , about five times what you now receive , and are you steadily climbing toward it ? What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it faster , sell it to more people , sell it for a higher price ? Next to being a good workman , being a good salesman counts most in every-day life . Whoever you are , whatever you do , however you aspire , you need salesmanship . Your ideas or inventions or poems or sermons or dreams , they must be sold , not put away to wither and rot . From dreams to deeds , from deeds to dollars to demonstrations ? find this path . The purpose in salesmanship is service , and the power in service is salesmanship . Each completes the other ; and whichever knowledge you lack , go forth and get it .
