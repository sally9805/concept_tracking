KaiserWilson " banners was made by Senator Myers of Montana , Democrat , in offering a bill today to do away with picket-. lng in the future , and also the flaunting of what he called their " almost treasonable utterances . " The six militant suffragists arrested yesterday for obstructing traffic at the White House were convicted in the Police Court today after a hearing lasting forty minutes . Judge bfullowney , who recently sentenced some of the militants to sixty days in the Workhouse , imposed the alternative of $10 fine or sixty days ' imprisonment . All the women declined to pay the fine and were taken to the-District of Columbia Workhouse at Occoquan , Va . The women sent to the Workhouse are Mrs. William Upton Watson of Chicago , Miss Natalie Gray of:Colorado Springs . Col. ; Miss Lavinia Dock of Fayetteaville , Tenn. ; Miss Lucy Ewing of Chicago , . Miss Edna Dixon of Washington , and Miss Catherine Flanagan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in urging the passage of his bill , said the whole nation had become " disgusted with the insults of these Women . " He asserted that the suffragists had , through their own acts , " brought opprobrium upon themselves , " and that the Senate ought not allow their " disgusting proceedings " to be carried on if adequate law could ' stop it . Senator Myers felt , he said , that the present law was not sufficiently comprehensive and urged the passage of his bill so that no loophole would remain by which the militants could indulge in their picketing of the White House .

In denouncing the militants who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded the Senate that he came from a State which had woman suffrage . While an advocate of women 's rights , he said , he felt a'higher obligation to his country in taking an attitude " against emit outrages as have been perpetrated before the White House . " Izioult to the Whole People . " This bill is Intended to enact more adequate legislation to prevent the infamous . outrageous , scandalous , and ; I think , almost treasonable actions that have been going on around the White House for months past , which have been a gross insult to the President of the United States and to the people of the United States , " said Senator Myers . " I mean the so-called picketing of the White House , branding the President of the United States as comparable to the Kaiser of Germany , the greatest autocrat , the worst despot , the most tyrannical ruler in the world , and a murderer who has brought upon the world the greatest scourge that . has ever been known in the history of all times . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kaiser of Germany . at the present time and under the present circumstances , while the President is carrying on his devoted shoulders the great load of our burdens and is making a desperate fight for our rights , is infamous , and I think it ought to be stopped . I think the people of the United States are disgusted with these outrages . They are . an insult . a flagrant insult , to the President and an insult to the people . He is our President , and , when he is insulted we are insulted . " They are an insult to every Senator and Representative who has consistently supported national woman suffrage , as I have , and I am tired of them . These disgusting proceedings have been going on for months , and if there is no adequate law to stop them I think there ought to be . " I see in the morning papers that the officals of the District of Columbia say these proceedings will stop . I hope so . They have had months to stop this insult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If the law is not adequate for this evil , we ought to have more law on the subject , because-I believe the people of the country want it . They are thoroughly tired , I believe , of this intolerable nuisance . They are disgusted with it . " I believe the President , in the generosity of his heart , erred when he pardoned sonic of the women who have been conducting these proceedings , after they had been sentenced to sixty days In the workhouse . 3. believe they deserved the sentence and ought to have been compelled to serve it . " It is high time that Congress took action in this matter and expressed its disapproval of these proceedings and of the women who conduct them . For myself , I am not satisfied to sit here idly day by day and submit to having the President of the United States insulted with impunity before the people of the country and before , all the world . It is a shame and a reproach . " Senator Brandegee asked if there had been any legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the workhouse . " I do not believe any was claimed . " replied Senator Myers . " There was none , so far as I know . But there seems to be a doubt that there is sufficient law to deal with their picketing . I do not think the laws arc severe enough . I think they ought to be made clearer and more comprehensive . " " They were stringent enough to land the malefactors in jail , " replied Senator Brandegee . " The Senator might with more effect propose an amendment to the Constitution preventing the President from pardoning out all malefactors after the law has had its due course . " Senator Myers differed from Senator Brandegee on that point , insisting that the President had merely been " too good-hearted and generous . " " But the fact that he erred . " added Senator Myers , " does not prevent me from feeling that there should be a more comprehensive , adequate and stringent law to control these women . "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
