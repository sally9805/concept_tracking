The play opens in a morning in October . It is about ten o'clock . The first act presents the drawing-room of the KNOLLYS ' house , situated on a corner in the fashionable fifties , New York City . The room is spacious , but a little old-fashioned . Up stage , at the right , is a large arch opening on a hall , which leads out to the front door off stage at the right . In the center of the arch there are three steps leading to a platform , from which a flight of stairs rises , going left , and leading to the rooms above . The balustrade continues on a level with the stage , and indicates that the stairs lead also downward from the front hall to the basement.In the middle of the right wall is a large marble mantelpiece , with an open fireplace . Above the mantel-hangs an old family portrait . On the wall below the mantel hangs an ornamental Venetian mirror . In the rear wall of the room , toward the left , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door and the arch stands a large bookcase , filled with books in expensive bindings . The left wall of the room is pierced by two large windows , with practical shades and blinds.A library table and three chairs occupy the center of the room , under a heavy chandelier . There is a large divan chair with cushions and a foot-stool placed down left of the room . Set on an angle in front of the fireplace is a Davenport . Below this , also on an angle is a settle . Several of the chairs and the Davenport are covered with linen slips or sheets , which indicate that the house has not been occupied for some time . The size and visible appointments of the room must suggest the atmosphere of large , though rather formal , luxury.The curtain rises on an empty stage . Dim light sifts through the closed blinds . There is a pause , and then the front door of the house is heard to open and close . A moment later HUBERT KNOLLYS enters from the hall , through the arch , putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . MURTHA . HUBERT KNOLLYS is a tall and distinguished looking man of fifty-three . He is dressed in a morning suit and a Panama hat . He carries a whisky and a couple of soda bottles under his arm . He also has a newspaper . MRS . MURTHA is an elderly Irish woman . HUBERT Phew ! It 's close in here ! Goes to a window which he opens and lets in the sunlight , then he turns and looks at MRS . MURTHA . Is your name Agnes Murtha ? p. 3 MURTHA No . That 's me daughter . D'ye see , Agnes was comin ' , the Lord love her , but she had a fall yisterday  --  HUBERT Oh , too bad . He begins removing the slips from the furniture . MURTHA Undoing her bonnet and showing her white head . Yis  --  She 's a foine eddication , so  --  she has ; but she bez a little weak in th ' knee . So Oi came over mesilf , as soon as Oi heard from Mrs. Sanbury . HUBERT Seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  MURTHA Oi 'm as shtrong as ivir Oi wuz . She energetically takes a slip from a piece of furniture . HUBERT The whole house must be got in shape . MURTHA Yis , m'am . Awed . An ' do yez own th ' whole house entoire ? He nods quizzically . Ah , glory be to God fer that ! HUBERT Going to open the second window . I 'll tend to the windows on this floor . Looking out , then turning . Oh , catch that ice-man and get him to leave a piece of ice . p. 4 MURTHA Now do you be shtandin ' there , son , so he do n't get away . Oi 'll let him in . She starts to go off through the arch . HUBERT Pointing to the door . No , this way through the basement . MURTHA scrambles off quickly . HUBERT pauses , looking out , sees the ice-man , whistles and gesticulates to him to wait and go down into the house . During this , SUSAN AMBIE enters from the hall through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the soul of a chaperon . She enters in nervous haste . HUBERT Why , Miss Ambie ! Shaking hands . Where 's Caroline ? AMBIE Get your hat and come right down to the dock with me . HUBERT I 'm never missed unless there 's been some trouble . What is it ? AMBIE Your wife has been grossly insulted , as I was ! It 's unheard of ! HUBERT Dawning . Ah ! trouble with the customs . Is that it ? AMBIE Indignantly . They have dared to suspect us , your wife and me ! HUBERT You mean they 've found you out . You too ! p. 5 AMBIE I 'm not speaking for myself . When I saw they were going to be disagreeable , I declared everything . But suddenly I realized that a vulgar inspector woman had been watching Caroline . I saw her take Carrie off ! All your wife 's trunks are held ! HUBERT Grimly relieved . Good ! AMBIE Recoiling with a stare . Carrie 's told me many things ; but I never believed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared for this for many years . If she will do things in her own high-handed way , she 'll have to stand the consequences . That 's why I never meet her . AMBIE Then you refuse to go ? HUBERT I refuse to be made a cat's-paw . That is , when I can help it . AMBIE Oh ! HUBERT What is there for me to do ? You must have made false declarations . AMBIE We did n't know they 'd be so strict with us . We 're not trades people or importers , or  --  HUBERT No you 're worse . Two women without even the wretched excuse of poverty , attempting to defraud the government ! AMBIE Mr. Knollys ! p. 6 HUBERT Ha ! The cold sweat is n't worth the money . Wipes his brow . AMBIE I do n't know what she 'll do ! HUBERT She 'll come home chastened in spirit , I hope , after having profited by this experience . AMBIE I really believe you 're glad she 's in trouble ! HUBERT Not that . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million citizens in their corporate capacity are able , for once in her life , to demonstrate to my good wife that she ca n't do everything she likes with everybody . I 've tried , her friends have tried , society has tried , perhaps the government will succeed . AMBIE Well , if ca n't make you see your duty  --  HUBERT Interrupting . The question of my duty to my wife is one that I do not care to discuss even with you . AMBIE It 's none of my business , I suppose HUBERT Bluntly . Quite so . AMBIE Fixes her hat . Then I 'll go back alone . Carrie 's my dearest friend  --  Then , in a bravado of accusing tearfulness . And I ca n't help it if I 'm not strong enough to stand by quietly and see her die of mortification ! p. 7 HUBERT Sarcastically . You might advise her to appeal to them for clemency . AMBIE She ca n't find less of it there than here ! He turns and goes up . Susan is about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a woman of forty , very young looking , handsome , commanding and self-possessed . She is faultlessly gowned . AMBIE With a cry . Oh , Carrie ! CAROLINE Entering . Oh , there you are , Susan . How are you , Hubert ? Shakes hands with him . Then to SUSAN . I did n't know what became of you . AMBIE I came right here . CAROLINE You should have told me . Ninette and I looked every place . AMBIE I did n't want those men to see us together . CAROLINE Nonsense ! AMBIE And I thought  --  CAROLINE Interrupting . You did n't think . You went right off your head . HUBERT Expectantly . Well ? p. 8 CAROLINE To HUBERT . You seem to thrive in my absence . To SUSAN . Does n't he ? HUBERT I return the doubtful compliment . The same to you , and many of them . CAROLINE Thank you . To SUSAN . You got through quickly , did n't you ? AMBIE When I saw they were going to be disagreeable , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? CAROLINE Shrugging her shoulders . I told you exactly what to do . AMBIE But when that woman searched me , I  --  CAROLINE You lost your nerve . AMBIE Oh , Carrie , I 'm not thinking of myself . What did they do to you ? HUBERT Expectantly . Yes , what did they do to you ? CAROLINE To me ? Why , what 's the matter ? AMBIE Relieved . Nothing , dear , if you 're all right . How brave you are ! CAROLINE Do n't be absurd ! p. 9 HUBERT Breaking in . I should hardly call it bravery . This was bound to come some time . I 've always said so . I 've always feared it . CAROLINE Calmly . Feared what ? HUBERT Miss Ambie 's told me everything ! CAROLINE With a sharp look at SUSAN . Oh , indeed ! Then there 's nothing for me to say Rises to cross . HUBERT Nettled . Caroline , I want to know exactly what has happened ; so if there 's anything that can be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm really sorry to disappoint you ; but there 's nothing to be done . HUBERT And how about your difficulty with the trunks ? CAROLINE Smiling . Sorry again . There 's been no difficulty . HUBERT Then why did you send for me ? CAROLINE I did n't send for you . HUBERT You did n't ! He looks at SUSAN inquiringly. p. 10 AMBIE I know , but  --  CAROLINE Whenever we are away from you , Hubert , we grow so accustomed to depend on the chivalry and courtesy of men , that on our return , Susan forgets , and has to learn her lesson of self-dependence over again . You must forgive her . Really , Susan , you gave yourself too much concern . AMBIE My dear , I was so frightened . Did n't that woman search you ? CAROLINE Me ? Oh , no ! I very soon put her in her place . And then , besides , I was careful to have nothing dutiable on my person . HUBERT Where are your trunks ? CAROLINE I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 'll be here shortly , I suppose . She stands before the Venetian mirror , takes off her hat and fixes her hair . HUBERT Caroline , there 's been quite enough of this bantering . Did you make a declaration ? CAROLINE Sufficient for all practical purposes . HUBERT And what does that mean ? CAROLINE I 've done exactly as I 've always done . I refused to argue the matter . I settled . Of course , as the law puts a premium on dishonesty , I found it expedient to  --  p. 11 HUBERT Interrupting . To what ? CAROLINE Smiling . To pay the premium . HUBERT It is n't only a question of expediency . It 's downright lying ! CAROLINE Sarcastically . Behold the moralist ! HUBERT Continuing . And it 's a question of decent , honest citizenship ! CAROLINE But I 'm not a citizen ; and I do n't care to be . If you were honest , you 'd confess you 're only irritated , Hubert , because you ca n't say : " I told you so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ; and do n't talk like a husband the first day I arrive . That does n't suit me . HUBERT is about to say something , but is interrupted by the entrance of Mrs. MURTHA from the basement . CAROLINE looks at her with an amused smile . MURTHA Mr. Knowllez , the motor-man from the taxi-cab is ashkin ' if you 'll be wantin ' him to wait any longer . AMBIE Oh , that 's my cab ! He 's been there all this time ! She flounces to the hall . HUBERT Wait , I 'll  --  p. 12 AMBIE With acerbity . No , thank you . Exits . MURTHA An ' th ' oice man will be wantin ' twinty cints fer th ' oice . To CAROLINE . Shure , it 's the grand box ye have . HUBERT Giving her money . Here . MURTHA goes to door . Oh , you can fetch up some glasses now , with ice in them ; if you will . MURTHA Yis , sor . Exits hastily . CAROLINE Amazed . Where did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Co-operative Servant Agency . " CAROLINE That must be the new name for the " Zoo . " Have you a match ? HUBERT Yes . CAROLINE Opening her cigarette case . Will you smoke ? HUBERT Thank you , I prefer my own . CAROLINE These are contraband . HUBERT The kind you like . CAROLINE Yes . He strikes a match for CAROLINE . She lights her cigarette . p. 13 HUBERT Well , did n't you have a good time abroad ? CAROLINE Certainly . He sits at left of table , and lights his cigarette . She sits at right . HUBERT But you changed your plans rather unexpectedly ? CAROLINE I hope that has n't inconvenienced you . HUBERT Not at all . SUSAN enters from the hall . AMBIE I hate America ! HUBERT Eh ? AMBIE When you sail up the harbor and see the Statue of Liberty , you feel a tremendous emotion of patriotism ; but when you see your first cab charge , you want to turn around and go right back to Europe . I told the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped ten cents while I was arguing with him ! CAROLINE Did you pay ? AMBIE I had to ! CAROLINE Then do n't complain . Pay or complain ; but do n't do both . It is n't economical . MURTHA enters , carrying three glasses awkwardly . MURTHA Here ye are , Mr. Knowllez ! CAROLINE opens the newspaper on the table and begins to read . p. 14 HUBERT Thank you , that will do . MURTHA Putting down the glasses . Shure , they 'll do . She suddenly stares as she sees CAROLINE smoking . Ah , fer th ' love o ' God ! CAROLINE looks up . MURTHA continues : Shure , Oi do be fergittin ' mesilf when Oi be passin ' rhemarks wid your hushband . Catching CAROLINE 'S eye . Oh , Lord , this , m'am . She wilts away and exits to basement . HUBERT opens the whisky bottle . HUBERT Miss Ambie , will you have a Scotch and soda ? AMBIE No , thank you , it always makes me silly . I 'll go directly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Take the front room on the third floor . AMBIE Do n't worry about me . I 'll have Ninette arrange your things . CAROLINE Turning over the paper . Thank you , dear . SUSAN exits up stairs . HUBERT She 's going to stay here ? CAROLINE Yes . p. 15 HUBERT Oh , then , in that case  --  He ostentatiously doubles his drink . How do you stand her ? CAROLINE She pays her own way and is very useful . HUBERT Sarcastically . I daresay ; but to me she 's simply an interfering nuisance . Pours soda into his whisky . CAROLINE Still reading . No . She 's a constitutional altruist . That is , she has the soul of a servant . HUBERT A scotch and soda ? CAROLINE I never take it in the morning . HUBERT Drinking . I always forget . CAROLINE Looking up . The Homestead stock at sixty-four ? HUBERT It closed at seventy yesterday . CAROLINE What made the slump ? HUBERT A series of muck-raking articles about Factory Reform , and a lot of talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassed . HUBERT I 've got to keep buying in to steady them . p. 16 CAROLINE Putting down the paper . I 'll lend you , Hubert ; but I wo n't invest . HUBERT Ironically . Really , Caroline , your generosity overwhelms me . CAROLINE Not at all . I know you have collateral . HUBERT I still hope to worry along without placing myself under financial obligations to you . CAROLINE Placing both her elbows on table and looking at him narrowly . Hubert , I 've often thought you resented my having independent means . HUBERT It 's foolish of me ; but I believe it might have made some difference in our lives , if you 'd been  --  CAROLINE Interrupting . If I 'd been dependent upon you for everything . If I had had no individuality of my own , or the means of keeping it intact . In other words , if I 'd been poor . Is that what you mean ? HUBERT No . But the superfluous wealth you 've had has deprived us both of at least one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there might have been something in our lives something we 've missed  --  something at any rate I 've missed . Some mutality  --  some interest together . Rising . Here we are , two people who have lived for twenty odd years together , and who have never really had even a trouble in common ! p. 17 CAROLINE With a remote smile . What trouble would you like to have me share with you ? Pause . HUBERT With a changed tone . Oh , none . CAROLINE Laughing . Hubert , do n't be romantic toward your wife . That 's waste . You 're neither old enough nor young enough to play that sketch convincingly . You 're neither dawn nor twilight ; and Romance needs something undiscovered , something in possibility , something not yet precipitated into noonday commonplace reality . And you and I  --  we know too much about each other to really carry that off without laughing in our sleeves . You say it is n't money . Oh , then I fear something has gone wrong with some object of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? HUBERT I  --  I was about to speak of Elsie and Stephen . CAROLINE Carelessly . Oh , yes . How are the happy couple ? HUBERT I 'm afraid our daughter 's not very happy . Stephen is a fool . CAROLINE I ca n't help that . HUBERT Have Elsie down here with us a little while  --  p. 18 CAROLINE Interrupting . Impossible ! HUBERT She might occupy her old rooms . CAROLINE I have other plans . HUBERT But a little motherly counsel from you might  --  CAROLINE Waving the discussion aside . Oh , Elsie and Stephen bore me to extinction ,  --  both of them . I did my best for her  --  gave her a coming out , a season in Newport and  --  HUBERT Interrupting . Then married her off , made her a settlement and got rid of her . Gad ! A girl of nineteen married ! CAROLINE How old was I ? HUBERT Well , our married life is nothing to boast of . CAROLINE Pardon , my dear Hubert , we 've made a brilliant success of marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has given both of us the fullest liberty  --  a liberty that I 've enjoyed ; and you 've  --  HUBERT Interrupting . Yes , you 've always done exactly what you wanted . CAROLINE Meaningly . And you ? HUBERT It makes no difference where we begin , we always wind up at the same place ; do n't we ? p. 19 CAROLINE Because you have abused your liberty . HUBERT Yes , I admit , it 's my fault  --  if you like , all my fault . It 's useless to go back over the old ruptures and recriminations . The prime mistake in both our lives was that we ever married . Well , we did . After about two years of doves , we had several years of cat and dog  --  and  --  CAROLINE I beg your pardon , in which class of animals do you place me ? HUBERT We wo n't quarrel about the phrase . You refused divorce or separation at a time in life when we might have got one without making ourselves ridiculous . CAROLINE Divorce is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get free for anything I should do . HUBERT Yes , you 've always been very careful about that . It is n't morality ; but you never cared to relinquish an advantage . You refused divorce for your own reasons ; and I agreed with you for Elsie 's sake . Then Elsie married  --  a great relief to you ; and we both agreed that the altitude of ideal husband and wife was too high for me to breathe in . You never cared about me ; yet you were always very anxious that nobody else should . In the real significance of marriage , you have broken all your vows but one . I have kept all my vows ,  --  p. 20 CAROLINE Sharply . Eh ? HUBERT But one . CAROLINE Ah ! HUBERT Continuing . That one violation of mine has given you the whip hand over me for these long years . CAROLINE Have you broken with that woman ? HUBERT What woman ? CAROLINE That Madden woman  --  Emily Madden . HUBERT You know nothing whatever about her . CAROLINE Pardon , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HUBERT Indeed ? CAROLINE And my friends have seen you every place with her . That 's all I really care about . HUBERT And they will continue to see us ; whenever Miss Madden does me the honor to accompany me . CAROLINE Resuming her newspaper . Oh , very well . I shall continue to condone everything ; because I do not wish the elaborate structure I have built for many years to be destroyed . Our marriage stands as a temple to the Goods of Convention . The priests are hypocrites ; but be careful not to make the congregation laugh . That 's all I ask of you . Quite simple , is n't it ? p. 21 HUBERT Yes , simple as all heartless things are . Pause . She reads . HUBERT walks up as SUSAN AMBIE enters from up stairs . AMBIE Carrie , I tried to ' phone the Intelligence Offices ; but your ' phone is n't connected . She looks accusingly at HUBERT . HUBERT Irritated . Excuse me . Goes to door , then turns . Oh , Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first good news that you announce . Exits . AMBIE Sentimentally . I can see by your face , dear , you 've had a scene . CAROLINE No . Just our annual understanding . AMBIE Curiously . You do n't have to tell me , Carrie . Pause . Has he broken with that Madden woman ? CAROLINE Smiling . I hope not . AMBIE It 's wonderful that all this has n't made you bitter . CAROLINE Bitter ? Laughing . I am very grateful to Miss Madden . AMBIE Quickly . Oh , Carrie , you did n't tell him that , did you ? p. 22 CAROLINE Laughs . Oh , dear no ! I never let him forget that at any moment I could name Miss Madden as a co-respondent . She is a weapon in my hands . AMBIE Admiringly . What a wonderful person you are ! Only  --  CAROLINE Only what ? AMBIE Only be careful , dear . Do n't give him a weapon against you . CAROLINE In what way ? AMBIE Of course you 'd never think about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as long as I can do that for you . But be careful , dear , about Lawrence Sanbury . CAROLINE Do n't be absurd . You were practically always with me . AMBIE With a nervous whimper . Oh , no , I failed you , Carrie ; I should have dragged along no matter how ill I was . CAROLINE Bluntly . Get that idea out of your head . AMBIE But if he should ever learn about your last days alone with Lawrence in the mountains CAROLINE He 'll never learn it . AMBIE And there is a Mrs. Sanbury , too ! p. 23 CAROLINE Impatiently . Of course ! Susan , I 've known artists all my life , and I 've never had to bother with their wives ; at least MURTHA enters excitedly from the hall . CAROLINE Would you mind knocking on the door before you enter a room ? MURTHA Pointing innocently to the arch . But there is n't any door , me dear . CAROLINE What is it ? MURTHA Me great friend and sishter , Mrs. Sanbury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to see you ! AMBIE Frightened . She 's here ! CAROLINE Tell them I 'm at home . MURTHA Going to the arch . Why would n't you be ? Shure , Oi told thim that already . AMBIE Anxiously . Oh , Carrie ! She 's here ! CAROLINE Secretly . Do n't be an ass ! MURTHA Calling out into the hall . Come , Lord bless yer lovin ' hearts ! It 's roight in here , yer to come ! Reentering . Shure Oi 'd trust her wid a million dollars . It was Mrs. Sanbury , it was , that sint me to you . p. 24 CAROLINE Oh , I 've her to thank for you , have I ? MURTHA Yis , m'am . Shure ye have . LAWRENCE and HILDEGARDE SANBURY enter from the hall . He is a handsome vital looking man of twenty-five . He has a quick and ingenuous , volatile manner . HILDEGARDE , his wife , is a woman of thirty , of sympathetic and responsive nature , full of exuberant gratitude to CAROLINE , whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact opposite of CAROLINE . She is scrupulously neat , but CAROLINE is a perfect conscience of every allure of fashion . They enter followed by MURTHA , who goes up rear . LAWRENCE nods to SUSAN . CAROLINE To HILDEGARDE . I 'm very glad you 've come . LAWRENCE Hildegarde , this is Mrs. Knollys . HUBERT enters quietly from the door leading to the basement . He is unnoticed amid the greetings . He goes nonchalantly towards window at left . HILDEGARDE When I heard Larrie was coming to you , I just could n't stay at home . LAWRENCE She would n't . So we  --  HILDEGARDE Interrupting . Oh , Larrie , you must let me speak ! You 've had Mrs. Knollys all to yourself for six long weeks  --  HUBERT turns as LAWRENCE goes to SUSAN . You see I 've heard so much about you . Larrie wrote me reams and reams of letters right from the beginning . p. 25 CAROLINE Purringly . Yes . HILDEGARDE Oh , yes ! I 've followed you every step you 've taken . SUSAN looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S presence . Indeed ! HILDEGARDE Seeing CAROLINE 'S face change . I hope we have n't intruded ! CAROLINE Not at all . Oh , Hubert , let me present you to Mr. and Mrs. Sanbury . HUBERT Ah ! How do you do ? They exchange greetings . CAROLINE I 've persuaded Mr. Sanbury to accept the commission to remodel the house . HUBERT Surprised . Oh , have you ! Pause . HILDEGARDE Continuing to CAROLINE . Oh , it was wonderful for Larrie to be with you . You were eyes to him in Italy . CAROLINE Let me present you to Miss Ambie . Pointedly . She was with us too . HUBERT notes this closely , though seeming not to listen . p. 26 HILDEGARDE Surprised . Oh , were you ? Goes immediately to SUSAN . Larrie wrote me you were taken ill in Switzerland , and that he and Mrs. Knollys went on alone . AMBIE Nervously . Oh , dear no , I mean I It was really nothing serious . HILDEGARDE I hope you 've recovered . AMBIE Oh , perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trip You see it was really only CAROLINE Seeing HUBERT 'S eye on them . Oh , Susan , it 's nearly twelve . To the others . Excuse me . Again to SUSAN . You might hail a taxi and settle the matter of servants for me . AMBIE Anxiously . Yes , yes , but had n't I better  --  ? CAROLINE Decisively , going to the hall with SUSAN . The club for luncheon . One o'clock . SUSAN exits . MURTHA Coming up from rear . Ah , it do be good-to see thim together again , eh ? CAROLINE Did you want to ask me anything ? p. 27 MURTHA If it 's a chambermaid ye want , me daughter Agnes  --  CAROLINE Would you mind closing the door ? MURTHA Ah , not at all . She crosses and closes the door , then returns . CAROLINE Cuttingly . I mean behind you . MURTHA Catching CAROLINE 'S eye and meaning . Oh , this , m'am . She exits . CAROLINE Motioning HILDEGARDE to a chair . Do I understand you run an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureau in connection with the tenements . LAWRENCE But , my dear , it 's hardly fair to Mrs. Knollys to send this old  --  HILDEGARDE Interrupting . We sent her daughter Agnes . You understand , only the derelicts come to us ; but you 'll see , Mrs. Murtha will do her work well . CAROLINE Tell me , do you really live among these people ? HILDEGARDE Yes , at the model tenement . Have you ever seen one ? p. 28 CAROLINE No ! HILDEGARDE I 'd be delighted to show you around . CAROLINE Yes . Miss Ambie and I will come some-time together . HILDEGARDE Do , and take luncheon with us at our cooperative dining-room . LAWRENCE To CAROLINE . I- would n't expect too much . You see , it 's a fad of hers  --  Democracy and the Underdog . HILDEGARDE Oh , no , that 's my real work . HUBERT Coming into the conversation . What ? HILDEGARDE We believe in giving the poor people better living conditions first ; so that then they will be better able to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discontented all along the line . HILDEGARDE Fervently . If only we could make them sufficiently discontented ! HUBERT Taking up the newspaper . I should say you were succeeding very well . Have you seen this series . of furious articles on Factory Reform ? HILDEGARDE Looking at paper . Yes . p. 29 HUBERT What do you think of them ? HILDEGARDE I ought to approve of them . HUBERT Why ? HILDEGARDE Because I wrote them . HUBERT Amazed . What ! You ? HILDEGARDE Yes . They 're mine . HUBERT You label these articles reform , but they read pretty much like anarchy to me . HILDEGARDE Do you know about our present factory conditions ? HUBERT Grimly . Somewhat , to my cost . You 've made me one of your horrible examples . HILDEGARDE What ! ! HUBERT I own the majority stock in the Homestead Mills . LAWRENCE Nervously . Good Lord , Hildegarde ! Your crowd have n't been attacking Mr. Knollys , have they ? HILDEGARDE To LAWRENCE . No one was mentioned by name . To HUBERT . Your manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we simply wrote up the mill . HUBERT Our manager has to compete with others . We give these people work . We do n't force our hands to come to us. p. 30 HILDEGARDE That 's it . The whole system is wrong . The state must remedy it . Individuals ca n't . You 've got to resort to the means of your lowest and most unscrupulous competitor ; or leave the field . HUBERT Do you mind answering a few questions ? HILDEGARDE Not at all . HUBERT To CAROLINE and LAWRENCE . Excuse us . He and HILDEGARDE go toward the hall . He takes some clippings from his pocket . In the first place you stated They exit and pass out of sight , going toward the right , in earnest conversation . CAROLINE is sitting in the large divan chair at the left . LAWRENCE comes toward her . LAWRENCE Enthusiastically . Is n't she splendid ! CAROLINE Softly ironical . You treat us all alike ; do n't you ? LAWRENCE How ? CAROLINE Quietly . She , too , is older than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year or two . That does n't matter . CAROLINE How chivalrous you are . But for your sake , she ought to be wiser . p. 31 LAWRENCE What do you mean ? CAROLINE Her radical theories about Democracy and  --  the great Unwashed Do you agree with them ? LAWRENCE I 'm an artist . I take no side whatever . CAROLINE But do n't you see , you 'll have to take a side ? LAWRENCE Why ? CAROLINE People of our class wo n't support you , if your wife attacks the very sources from which they pay you . LAWRENCE With sudden anxiety . Oh , perhaps Mr. Knollys will resent what Hildegarde has done , and wo n't care to give me the work . Is that what you mean ? CAROLINE I mean your wife must n't add to my difficulties . LAWRENCE Sincerely distressed . Oh , Lord ! In wrong the first crack out of the box ; and I wanted you so much to like each other ! CAROLINE Tell me ,  --  is she really as frank as she seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? CAROLINE I was a little startled when I learned you 'd written her so definitely about our tour in Italy . p. 32 LAWRENCE Relieved . Oh , that 's all right . Hildegarde thinks nothing about that . CAROLINE But she must n't give everybody credit for so much sympathetic understanding . With a glance toward the hall . LAWRENCE You mean your husband ! CAROLINE Quickly . Do n't speak so loudly ! With a change to a seductive , problematical manner . I have n't told you everything about my life . I thought you guessed . LAWRENCE Why , surely , he would n't dare to misjudge you , would he ? CAROLINE We move in a society that does not trust itself , so it is always suspicious . LAWRENCE I hope you 'll forgive me . I 'm just a fool about these things . CAROLINE Seeing HUBERT and HILDEGARDE approaching . Pst ! Say nothing more . HUBERT Re-entering from the hall . To HILDEGARDE . If I 'm on top , I know I 'll treat the laborer as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't expect so much in return . They get a living wage . p. 33 HILDEGARDE You 'd better take a trip down South and see how well they live . HUBERT Perhaps I shall . And then I 'll want to see you again . HILDEGARDE Do ! To the others . Until then we part , good , class-conscious , cordial enemies . HUBERT Pointing to the newspaper . Very well . And how about these articles ? HILDEGARDE To-morrow we begin on your competitors . HUBERT Good ! That 's fair play . CAROLINE Hubert , would you mind showing Mr. Sanbury about the house ? HUBERT Now ? CAROLINE Yes . Mrs. Sanbury will remain with me . HILDEGARDE nods . HUBERT We 'll go this way . LAWRENCE Excuse me . LAWRENCE and HUBERT exit through hall and are seen mounting the stairs . CAROLINE Points to a chair in the full light . You do n't mind the light ? HILDEGARDE Oh , not at all . CAROLINE Speaking as she pulls up the shade full upon HILDEGARDE . I 'm sure we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your husband to succeed . p. 34 HILDEGARDE It 's fine of you to be so interested . He 's never had a chance to prove what he can do . CAROLINE Sitting with her back to the light . My interest will excuse many personal questions . Charmingly . He being so young , we can discuss him and his future from the same point of view . HILDEGARDE Yes , Larrie for all his twenty-five years is just a great big boy . CAROLINE How did you come to live there in the tenements ? HILDEGARDE Surely Larrie has told you ! CAROLINE But I never trust a husband to tell me all about his home . Insinuatingly . If the wife loves him very much , he never really knows his circumstances . HILDEGARDE We 've had no secrets from each other . We struggled on together right from the beginning . I sometimes got disheartened , but Larrie never did . CAROLINE Ah ! Did he decide to live there ? HILDEGARDE No . I lived there first , and when we married , we decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CAROLINE But do you think the tenement is quite the  --  ah  --  the atmosphere for him to work in ? p. 35 HILDEGARDE He has n't complained ; and offices cost lots of money . CAROLINE Yes . HILDEGARDE Your commission will enable him to start in business for himself ; and then we hope to afford a better place . CAROLINE Yes . But have you ever considered how your very work in the world might hinder him ? HILDEGARDE Puzzled . In what way ? CAROLINE Art has always been the luxury of a leisure class . It has always been supported by the patronage of wealth ; and you ca n't expect that the people whom you attack , and publicly attack , are going to reply by using their influence to promote your husband . HILDEGARDE Then Lawrence must work his way without their influence . CAROLINE With narrowing eyes . In the school of adversity , eh ? HILDEGARDE Proudly . That school has brought out the best in many artists ! CAROLINE And has killed thousands of others that we never hear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good school ; provided you do n't matriculate too early and continue too long . p. 36 HILDEGARDE I 'd rather continue just as we are now to the end of our days , than have him sell his soul and abandon all he 's stood for . CAROLINE You would ; but how about him ? HILDEGARDE He would too ! CAROLINE Perhaps I know him better than you do . HILDEGARDE I do n't think so . CAROLINE Then some day , you may have to reproach yourself for his failure . HILDEGARDE I ? CAROLINE Yes . HILDEGARDE Why should he fail ? CAROLINE Just because of his unusual qualities . The world at best is a cruel place . It gives its prizes to the ordinary . It martyrizes the exceptional person , because it does n't understand him , and what it does n't understand , it fears ; and what it fears , it destroys , or worse than that , it allows to die unnoticed . The world will make your husband suffer , just because he is exceptional . HILDEGARDE I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an optimist to be a fanatic . With your help I hoped to place him where I know he belongs . But I can not ; if you oppose it . Pause. p. 37 HILDEGARDE I do n't see how I stand in his way ! CAROLINE You have already made a difficulty with my husband . HILDEGARDE How ? CAROLINE My dear , you can hardly expect my husband to give your husband an expensive commission ; when you spend your time writing articles that lower the value of the most important investment he holds . HILDEGARDE Then Lawrence will have to choose . CAROLINE Oh , no . You must n't put that on him . You must n't bind him by his love for you . For if he fails to choose properly , you will be forced to bear the burden of his bitterness . And there 's nothing so bitter in the world as an artist 's bitterness . Looking at her closely . It wo n't come now . I grant you a few years more of his hopeful illusions and youthful courage ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  at heart , and he still in his prime ; but with the sources of his faith run dry  --  eaten with disappointments , sick with postponements , his inspiration festered by discouragement ; while he still knocks listlessly at the doors , which would be open to him now ; but will be closed hereafter , when his opportunities have passed him by . HILDEGARDE That ca n't be true ! p. 38 CAROLINE Continuing ruthlessly . And in the cruel retrospect , then his awakening will come ; and he will see that it has been Cynicallywhat you call your " life-work " that has hindered him . And then , what will his love for you be worth to you or him ? HILDEGARDE Obstinately . He has his work , I have mine . It 's for him to choose . CAROLINE And is your muck-raking worth his career ? Knowing that he loves you now , and will be influenced by you , have you a right to make him choose ? HILDEGARDE No more than you ! CAROLINE There is this difference :  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I ! CAROLINE I doubt it . HILDEGARDE Passionately . Do n't you think it would be easier for me to see him settled ? I 've walked the floor at night ! I 've agonized over his career , while he 's been sleeping like a child ! CAROLINE Quickly . Ah , then there have been secrets ! HILDEGARDE Continuing . Yes ! I 've made it a point of honor not to allow him to spend one cent on me ! Suddenly . You 're looking at this dress ! I know it 's shabby  --  You 've noticed it  --  He has n't p. 39 CAROLINE My dear , you must n't feel sensitive about your clothes ! HILDEGARDE Choking back her tears . It 's the first time that I ever was ! CAROLINE You must let me give you a gown or two . HILDEGARDE Recoiling . Oh , no ! I could n't accept them  --  I could n't ! CAROLINE But , my dear  --  HILDEGARDE Proudly . Excuse me , do n't presume ! CAROLINE I hoped you 'd understand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are people he must meet  --  people that will be of use to him . I want to arrange it . You wo n't object ? HILDEGARDE Oh , no ! CAROLINE It 's always easy for a man  --  a dress suit and there you are . But we women are at a disadvantage without the proper equipment , and HILDEGARDE Please leave me out of all your calculations . I sha n't complicate matters . CAROLINE My dear , I merely intended to save you from embarrassment . HILDEGARDE I am very grateful . But I repeat , it 's impossible I should accept anything from you . We belong to two totally different orders . p. 40 CAROLINE Then as you 're unwilling to meet the social requirements , you will understand perfectly , if you 're not included in HILDEGARDE Certainly . I shall not expect to be invited . CAROLINE I must compliment you , Mrs. Sanbury . You 're stronger than I thought you were . Pause . The two women look at each other . HILDEGARDE is dazed . CAROLINE is smilingly confident . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job introducing Queen Victoria to the Renaissance . You 've plenty of room ; that is , if you 'll let me smash the conventional partitions . CAROLINE Meaningly . I always like to smash conventional partitions ; provided the outside walls remain intact . Have you explained to Hubert ? LAWRENCE He could n't follow the sketch . CAROLINE With a veiled sneer . You 'll have to build models before he can see . LAWRENCE After a slight hesitation . Will you really need models ? CAROLINE I am afraid so . How long would it take you ? p. 41 LAWRENCE Well , you know , I 've left my old firm ; and I 'll first have to look about for larger quarters . HILDEGARDE Involuntarily . Oh ! LAWRENCE Confidently . I 've been thinking of changing . It 's only been a question of the proper place . CAROLINE Knowingly smiling at HILDEGARDE . Oh , of course . But I 've an idea . In insisting upon models , I appreciate I am asking the unusual ; but I want to expedite matters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? LAWRENCE Yes . CAROLINE Could n't you build your models there ? LAWRENCE Eagerly . Splendidly ! Relieved . That would solve everything ; would n't it , Hildegarde ? To CAROLINE . . And I could consult with you at every step . CAROLINE Yes . To HILDEGARDE . And in that way , we need n't interfere with your plans at the tenement . HILDEGARDE Oh ! p. 42 CAROLINE Perhaps you 'd better advise with your wife before you decide . I 'll speak with Hubert Excuse me . She exits through the hall . LAWRENCE Watches her out of the tail of his eye . As soon as she is off , his manner changes , and he comes to HILDEGARDE in hushed excitement . He takes her hands and speaks quickly . I 'm glad , old girl , you did n't butt into any of my bluffs ! I got a cold sweat when she spoke about models ! Wiping his brow . Phew ! That was a poser ! But did you see me do it ? Imitating his former manner . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flourish of his hand . Money no object . Did you see me ? With not enough to the good to keep the sheriff off any place for a single month ! Sitting . That fourth storey is too good to be true ! Devoutly . God bless the ugliness of Queen Victoria ! God bless the rich with big houses and small families ! Do n't wake me ! HILDEGARDE Then you 're going to accept her top floor ? LAWRENCE Flabbergasted to an echo . Am I going to accept her ? Watch me ! I 've never told you ; but I have n't been able to work there in the tenements . This address alone will get me credit for materials . And right now , I 'm in no position to deny her anything . p. 43 HILDEGARDE Evidently . LAWRENCE Rubbing his chin . Gosh ! The old man was pretty mum about the plan . Suddenly . He may be sore about those articles of yours ! I hope they have n't queered it . HILDEGARDE Oh , I fancy she 'll arrange it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you do n't seem to realize what this job means to me ! HILDEGARDE Perhaps I do , even more than you . LAWRENCE Intensely . Money ! That 's what it means Money ! A thing we 've never had , and a thing we 've got to get ! HILDEGARDE Is money everything ? LAWRENCE Yes , now  --  everything Money ! I want money  --  money to be free to do things  --  money to get things for you . Do you think I like to see you wearing rags like this ? Pointing to her dress . HILDEGARDE With a quick pain . Oh , as for me  --  LAWRENCE I 've had enough of the tenements ! I 've never told you  --  HILDEGARDE Larrie ! ! p. 44 LAWRENCE Excitedly . That 's all right , my dear . You 're a fanatic about some things . I do n't interfere with you , and you must n't interfere with me ! Change . Perhaps you 'd better go . I mean if you 're not in sympathy with the scheme , for God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's lots that I could say , Larrie . LAWRENCE Yes , I know , but not here . Listen  --  Open your head ! I 've got to nail this job . I want to do it on my own hook . Then if I take it to a firm , I collar some of the swag and get some credit for my work . I may never wing a chance to start like this again . She is about to say something but he continues . We 're broke  --  and no instalment until the plans and models are accepted . Here I get a place rent free , materials on tick , with Lawrence Sanbury I-N-C upon the signs . I 'll incorporate my debts . Otherwise , back again into an old thirty a week job to sweat for the other fellow all my life . Quickly giving HILDEGARDE her coat . Hildegarde , here  --  take your rags and run . HILDEGARDE Quietly . Shall I wait luncheon ? LAWRENCE Hang luncheon . I 'm going to eat this job . p. 45 HILDEGARDE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be lots of days like this coming . Holding her coat . Here  --  here she comes . Just say good-by . Enter CAROLINE from the hall . CAROLINE Well , I 've spoken with my husband . LAWRENCE Restrained . Yes ? CAROLINE He thinks it an admirable plan for you to work here . LAWRENCE Relieved . Ah , then that 's settled ! CAROLINE So we can begin immediately that is if  --  Looks at HILDEGARDE . HILDEGARDE I was just going . CAROLINE is silent . Good-by , Mrs. Knollys . CAROLINE With feigned surprise . Oh ! Then in a commonplace tone . Good-by . I sha n't forget your invitation to the tenements . LAWRENCE Excuse me , Hildegarde , I 'll be home  --  ah  --  shortly . HILDEGARDE goes quickly to the arch , and exits through the hall . LAWRENCE makes a move to follow her , then pauses perplexed . CAROLINE watches him narrowly . p. 46 LAWRENCE Scratching his head . By Jove ! What makes a fellow a brute sometimes to the woman he cares for ? CAROLINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is instinctively unscrupulous toward anything that hinders its development . LAWRENCE But Hildegarde would n't hinder me ! CAROLINE Not intentionally , certainly not . She 's an exceptional person . Sitting . I 'm sorry she does n't like me . LAWRENCE Fighting against- his own conviction . What makes you think she does n't like you ? CAROLINE She has her  --  ah  --  principles . Unfortunately they oppose everything I stand for . LAWRENCE You do n't know her , she CAROLINE Perhaps not , and I 'm so sorry ! for I hoped we should agree about you . LAWRENCE But she must see how much you mean to me , and  --  CAROLINE Perhaps you 've been too frank with her . LAWRENCE I never conceal anything from Hildegarde . CAROLINE Ironically . No. p. 47 LAWRENCE Continuing . And I 'd hate any person that made me lie ! Sitting disconsolately . What can I do ? CAROLINE That you must decide yourself . You stand at a crossing , Lawrence . The one road means the old limitations and the commonplace : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to choose , because she loves you dearly . LAWRENCE Of course she does ! CAROLINE Therefore it 's quite natural she should resent any one having the power to do for you what she would like to do ; but ca n't . I 'd feel that way myself , if LAWRENCE If what ? CAROLINE If I loved you the way she does . If I were n't ambitious for your great work ! LAWRENCE But she wants me to do big work . CAROLINE Shaking her head . You feel things in you that she never dreamed of . That 's why With a change . But I ought n't make you conscious . LAWRENCE What is it ? CAROLINE With a show of reluctance . That 's why you are n't at your best , when you 're with her . Now there , I 've said it . p. 48 LAWRENCE But I have n't had the chance of really explaining to her all I want to do , and CAROLINE Unscrupulously . An artist justifies himself by doing : not explaining ! Consider everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the conscience of an artist . His work is always greater than his life . LAWRENCE By Jove , I always see clearer when I talk to you ! CAROLINE Passionately . I am unscrupulous for the best in you ! LAWRENCE Taking her hands . You 're wonderful ! CAROLINE I must n't be mistaken in you ! LAWRENCE Kissing her hands . You wo n't be . CAROLINE I have a problem too , because of you . LAWRENCE Dropping her hands . Yes , I know . CAROLINE And you must justify me as well . We made a compact . Have you forgotten it ? LAWRENCE The afternoon we left Florence . CAROLINE And climbed the hills toward Fiesol alone . p. 49 LAWRENCE Rapt . In the flaming orange scarfs of mist , with the whole world behind us in the valley . CAROLINE Where you said the world should always be for the artist with the vision and the will to create a new form of art . You were splendid then ! LAWRENCE And afterward , the long ride on to Brescia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pause . With a change . I thought that memory belonged to us alone . LAWRENCE It does ! CAROLINE Raising her finger . You shared it . LAWRENCE Forget that , please . CAROLINE I hope the others will . MURTHA 'S VOICE Up stairs . Will I hang the things up here , sir ? HUBERT 'S VOICE Up stairs . Yes , just put them in the closet , please . CAROLINE Quickly to LAWRENCE . Sit down . He starts to sit in a chair near her . She points to one at right of stage . No ; over there . He goes quickly to the other side . She continues . We 'll lunch together . The Colony Club at one o'clock . p. 50 LAWRENCE I thought that Hildegarde might  --  CAROLINE Interrupting peremptorily . I must see you . LAWRENCE But on my first day home  --  CAROLINE Impatiently . Between Susan 's nervousness and your thoughtlessness , I LAWRENCE Very well . Enter HUBERT from the hall . HUBERT H 'm ! Still talking over plans ? LAWRENCE Rising , embarrassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Knollys . HUBERT Me ? For what ? LAWRENCE The fourth storey . It 'll be a great help to me . HUBERT looks perplexed . CAROLINE You know , I have asked Mr. Sanbury to build his models there . HUBERT Grimly . Ah have you ! I did n't know . LAWRENCE Filling in the awkward pause . Then you can see exactly how the rooms will look . HUBERT Oh , as for me Smiles . Quite so . Very kind of you  --  very . Where 's your wife ? p. 51 LAWRENCE She 's already gone . HUBERT Sarcastically . If you should see her again , you might tell her that I 've decided to go South immediately . LAWRENCE Jerking at his watch . Yes  --  ah She 'll be delighted to hear that and ah I was delighted to meet you , Mr. Knollys ; and if you 'll excuse me  --  I 'll  --  I 'll be going now . He stand awkwardly . HUBERT goes to the hall , then turns to LAWRENCE . HUBERT Good morning . LAWRENCE Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Knollys . CAROLINE Good-by . HUBERT nods . LAWRENCE exits . Pause . HUBERT Laughing softly . Caroline , I think your latest is a light-weight ! CAROLINE Changing the subject . You 're going South ? HUBERT I hope you 'll endure my absence . Pause . What was your object in giving your young man the impression that you had to consult me in anything ? p. 52 CAROLINE I generally consult you . HUBERT Yes . After you 've completed your arrangements . It 's your house . I 've nothing to say . But I see now why you needed . Elsie 's room . A furious knock is heard in the hall . They both start as MURTHA enters . MURTHA Proudly . Ah , did ye hear me knock ? CAROLINE What is is ? MURTHA A young lady 's in th ' front hall . To HUBERT . She wants to see you , Mr. Knowllez . HUBERT To see me ? MURTHA Hesitating . She says she 's from th ' Cushtoms office , so she says . HUBERT Grimly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAROLINE To MURTHA . Send her in here . MURTHA Shure Oi will  --  whoy would n't Oi ? Exits to hall . HUBERT Why should the young lady want to see me ? CAROLINE Have you money with you ? HUBERT Taking out his bill case . Yes . p. 53 CAROLINE With a smile . I gave her my card . HUBERT But  --  CAROLINE Taking his bill case and going to window . Let me see . All she 's come for is more money . HUBERT during the above goes toward the hall . CAROLINE 'S back is to him . EMILY MADDEN enters nervously from the right . She is a young woman of about twenty-eight . HUBERT makes a quick recoil of amazement and a half-smothered exclamation : " Emily ! " She , seeing CAROLINE , gives him a quick gesture of silence . MADDEN In a breathless staccato and a forbidding manner . This is Mr. Knollys , I believe . HUBERT Yes . CAROLINE Turning and coming down . I hope you 've had no difficulty . MADDEN You evidently did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , why , of course , I wish to pay you for any further  --  MADDEN Violently . Please ! HUBERT Caroline ! CAROLINE Oh ! p. 54 MADDEN Mrs. Knollys , all your trunks are held . CAROLINE Savagely . The insolence ! MADDEN It was the only way to save you from a charge of smuggling and CAROLINE Indeed ! MADDEN I could n't make you realize it . That 's why I 've come to see your husband . CAROLINE With a smile . Thank you very much . HUBERT Caroline , you 'd better let me settle this . CAROLINE Crossing to the hall . By all means . You always settle things so adequately . To EMILY . Good morning . She starts to go up stairs , then turns and says significantly to HUBERT : Oh , your purse ! She throws it gracefully over the balustrade . He , standing below , catches it . She continues up stairs . He watches her out of sight , then turns and comes down to EMILY . HUBERT Giving way to his astonishment . Emily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mixed up in this ? MADDEN Quickly . I left the newspapers and got a position . in the Customs . This morning I saw her name on the list of passengers . She fell into the hands of one of the sourest old inspectors . He found some jewels in a sachet bag . Then he caught her in a lie . As usual , he asked her to reconsider her declaration . She refused p. 55 HUBERT Unconsciously . The damned fool ! MADDEN Then he insisted she be searched . HUBERT Naturally . MADDEN As I was standing there , the officers deputed me to look her over . HUBERT Appalled . But she did n't know who you were , did she ? MADDEN Oh , no , but I took the chance to tell her of the penalty : ten thousand dollars ' fine , or two years ' imprisonment , or both . HUBERT I hope that sobered her ! MADDEN Judge for yourself . She said she had a list , and gave me this envelope . Giving him an envelope out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two one hundred dollar bills . MADDEN One for my partner . There were two of us . HUBERT Putting envelope on table . The same old game . MADDEN I felt like throwing it into her face ; but then I thought of you , and held my temper . The inspectors were waiting . HUBERT What did you do ? p. 56 MADDEN I told your wife I 'd tend to everything , and got her off . Then I reported for her that she had reconsidered , had nothing on her person , she was ill and did n't know what things were dutiable ; and therefore wanted all her stuff to be appraised . HUBERT Good ! And then ? MADDEN Then I tried to ' phone you everywhere , and finally I had to take the chance of even meeting  --  her again , and come right here to tell you . HUBERT You little thoroughbred . MADDEN Hubert , do nothing until you hear from them . Dispute nothing , but make her stick to the story that I framed up for her , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . HUBERT Right ! I do n't know how to thank you . MADDEN Return this to your wife with my compliments . Points to envelope . HUBERT I guess you 're all in , Emily . MADDEN Oh , do n't mind about me . HUBERT Filthy business , this . Suddenly anxious . There 'll be no consequences for you ? MADDEN I guess not . HUBERT Walking about . I do n't know how it is . She never learns . She does exactly what she pleases . Experience means nothing to her ; because in some way she always manages to get protected , no matter what she does . She 's skated over thin ice all her life  --  she courts the danger signals ; and just when anybody else would fall through , an unknown somebody reaches her a hand out of the universe and lands her safe ! Gad ! and to think that it was you that helped her ! p. 57 MADDEN I do n't think that would appeal to her sense of humor . HUBERT Did she bring over much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . HUBERT Six thou Phew ! Well , that 's her affair . But sit down a moment . He puts her on settle , then sits at right of the table . Tell me , how did you get into the Customs office ? MADDEN I got tired of the paper . My friend Hildegarde Sanbury suggested the Customs , and helped me get it . HUBERT Oh , Mrs. Sanbury 's a friend of yours . MADDEN Yes , why ? HUBERT They were here this morning . MADDEN Were they ? Is n't Hildegarde fine ? HUBERT Tell me about him ! MADDEN You mean Lawrence ? HUBERT Yes . MADDEN They say he 's a genius , full of all wonderful things , and just waiting for his opportunity to express them . HUBERT Yes , just the type ! MADDEN What type ? p. 58 HUBERT Do you know where he and Caroline met ? MADDEN I 've no idea ; except that they spent some time together in Italy . HUBERT What was he doing there ? MADDEN Studying and making sketches . Hildegarde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . HUBERT So this is her latest ! MADDEN What do you mean ? HUBERT I wonder if I can explain it . Caroline has a mania for depredating the next generation . She poses to herself as the heroine of a belated romance . MADDEN But she knows Lawrence is married ; does n't she ? HUBERT She prefers them married . Takes all the perfume and the blossoms , and lets the wife grub at the roots . She likes to be the destiny and let the wife assume the utility . Does he love his wife ? MADDEN Why , of course , devotedly . That 's the finest thing about him . HUBERT Better yet . She enjoys making a test of her power . MADDEN Impulsively . Hildegarde 's the best in the world , Hubert , and HUBERT Then I pity her . p. 59 MADDEN You do n't mean your wife will hurt Hildegarde , do you ? HUBERT Bitterly . She wo n't bleed ; that is , outwardly . She 'll just wake up and find her happiness evaporated . MADDEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child before a sophisticated person . HUBERT Desperately . What can I'do ? Caroline has done this all her life ; and as she operates under the protection of my name , I 've had apparently to stand by and sanction it . MADDEN Ca n't you stop her ? HUBERT Again walking about . How ? You 'd respect her if she showed one real emotion . She 's physically chaste ; but is absolutely unchastened in soul ; and yet she feeds on the souls of others . That 's how she keeps young . She 's a mental Bluebeard , and I 'm the hotel clerk for her castle I know where all her miserable relics hang What rooms and what days of their lives they 've offered her ! MADDEN Why , this is horrible , Hubert ! HUBERT Continuing . I 'd give my eyes to stop her ! If not for the sake of others , for my own sake ! She 's broken me ! I tried to get free for years at the beginning . But she plays so absolutely safe She protects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MADDEN Ca n't he be warned ? HUBERT Not if she gets him first . Her kind of poison strikes them blind . There 's nothing to be done for him . Just you keep out of her way . MADDEN Do n't worry . I will . Well , I must get back to work . She starts to go again . HUBERT My dear , why will you work ? Why wo n't you let me take care of you ? MADDEN I wish to earn my own living , Hubert . You know that . HUBERT Yes . But I want to ask you Why have you avoided me for this long time ? MADDEN Hubert , I did n't want to write it ; but it 's over between us . HUBERT After a pause . Yes , I 've realized that . MADDEN Very tenderly . Hubert , I 've no reproach to make you ; and I do n't want you to reproach me , or to feel any bitterness . What we gave was a free gift from both  --  a free gift and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suppose ; and as soon as I met him , I  --  I realized that it had to come right away . Looking away from HUBERT . He asked no questions ; but that 's why you have n't seen or heard from me . Hubert I 'm going to marry Michael Krellin. p. 61 HUBERT After a pause . Good luck to you . He takes her hand in both of his . But I thought you did n't believe in marriage . MADDEN Neither did he . But I 'm afraid we both believe in marriage now . I ca n't tell you how it happened ; but it 's different , Hubert That 's all -I know you 'll understand . HUBERT nods and releases her hand . She goes toward the hall . HUBERT Emily She stops and turns . We 've been good chums for a long time ; and , do you know , you 've never allowed me to give you anything ? MADDEN That was our agreement , Hubert . HUBERT Yes ; but I want you to promise me this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and need anything , a friend or money , and need it without strings , I want you to think of me . I 'd like to feel you 'd do that much for the sake of Auld Lang Syne . MADDEN Coming to him . All right . I promise . Extends her hand . Good-bye . HUBERT Quietly . as he takes her hand . Krellin 's a very lucky fellow . MADDEN That 's like you , Hubert. p. 62 HUBERT I 'll call you a cab . MADDEN Never mind . Do n't come with me , please . I 'll run right along . She turns and says very tenderly : Good-by . HUBERT Good-by . She exits through the hall . After she is off , HUBERT stands looking after her until the front door is heard to close . He drops his hands disconsolately and walks mechanically to the table at center . His eyes fall upon the envelope still lying there . He takes it up . His mood changes . He gets a sudden idea . He looks up , throws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture , and goes with vehement determination toward the stairs . He pauses at the bottom of the stairs , shakes his head perplexed , and then decides upon a different attack . He calls very pleasantly : HUBERT Ah , Caroline ! CAROLINE Up stairs . Yes . HUBERT I 'd like to see you for a moment . CAROLINE Are you alone ? HUBERT Still pleasantly . Yes . Oh , yes . CAROLINE I 'll be right down . HUBERT walks round the room gathering his confident anger with every step . He hears her coming , controls his humor , and stands with his hands behind him , full of exasperation , as she enters . p. 63 CAROLINE Did you settle it ? HUBERT Deliberately giving her a chair . One moment . CAROLINE Susan is waiting me for luncheon . HUBERT Decidedly . Very sorry . CAROLINE Inquiringly . Well ? HUBERT Very sorry , but I 'm afraid I 'll need some of your time this afternoon . CAROLINE After sitting , looks up demurely . What for ? HUBERT With great distinctness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ventured to criticize me . You asked me to leave it to you . I do . HUBERT Losing control . About six thousand dollars ' duty for you to pay ! CAROLINE I ? Perfectly ridiculous ! I settled it . Of course , if you HUBERT Angrily . You did , eh ? CAROLINE Laughing . If you were fool enough to let that woman  --  p. 64 HUBERT If " that woman " treated you as you deserve  --  CAROLINE I think I treated her very well . HUBERT It was only out of consideration for me that she  --  CAROLINE Oh , for you ! HUBERT Yes , for me . If " that woman " did n't happen to be a friend of mine , you might be publicly disgraced by now as well as I ! CAROLINE Laughing . A friend of yours ! Why , really , Hubert , I must say you have strange friends  --  A woman that would use her friendship to extort money HUBERT Enraged . Listen to me ! Your trunks are in the hands of the appraisers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she  --  CAROLINE Triumphantly . She ca n't say that , because I bribed her ! Your friend ! HUBERT Flinging the envelope on the table . There 's your two hundred dollars , and you 'll have to pay six thousand dollars on your trunks , and be grateful to Miss Madden for having saved you ! CAROLINE To whom ? HUBERT With great confidence . Miss Emily Madden , the woman you maligned. p. 65 CAROLINE In a moment of rage . She looked me over ! She dared ! HUBERT Gloating . It was Miss Madden . He walks away from her , turns with supreme elation . Yes . CAROLINE In a peal of laughter . Then I understand perfectly why she came to you ! But I 'm not so easy . The matter of the trunks was settled . Walking to the hall . Of course , if you feel that you are subject to her extortions , or that perhaps you want to give her a token of your gratitude , that 's your affair . Turning to him . It would really be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistress ! HUBERT Foiled and following her furiously . You Chokes . CAROLINE Very pleasantly . Good morning . Susan is waiting . She exits as the Curtain descends. @x The stage presents the combined kitchen and living room of the SANBURY flat in the model tenements , New York City . The whole atmosphere betrays great neatness , but equal constriction and narrowness of quarters . At the first glance , the room is apparently all doors . The walls are done in waterproof white . There is a window in the rear wall , a little to the left . This opens on a fire-escape , and gives a view of other tenements in the rear . There is a shade over the window , which is further hung with chintz curtains , that are visibly cheap , but in good taste as far as the design is concerned . In front of the window is an upholstered window-seat . To the left of the window is a small serving table , with cruets of vinegar and oil , and a salad-bowl upon it . Below this table hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas-stove with a coffee-pot upon it . High on the wall above the gas-stove is a gas-meter of the kind commonly in use in the tenements . It is automatic , and releases a supply of gas only when a quarter is dropped into it . At the left of the stove and in the corner of the room is a combination sink and wash-tub of white porcelain ware . The dwellers in the tenements use the wash-tub as an ice-box . At the opening of the act , a four-fold screen hides both the sink and the stove from view . However , above the screen , a towel rack with clean dish towels is visible . In the upper left wall of the room is a door leading to LAWRENCE 'S bedroom . Below this , there is a combination wall book-case and mirror . The book shelf is jammed with well-used books . Directly underneath the book-case stands a flat table upon which are a typewriter and a telephone.In the rear wall of the room , to the right of the window , is the door leading from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumb-waiter shaft , with a sliding panel door . In the right wall of the room is the entrance to HILDEGARDE 'S bedroom . A little below this is the door leading to the bathroom . There is an electric bell above the hall door , another electric bell above the dumb-waiter . Next to the dumb-waiter is a speaking tube , which rejoices in a very shrill whistle.RUNNING around the whole room is a plate shelf with colored plates upon it . There are framed pictures of Tolstoy , Ruskin and Prince Kropotkin conspicuously hung upon the walls.At the center of the room is a large mission table , set with a plate , knife , cup and saucer , napkin and bowl of fruit . The morning newspaper lies opened . Between the dumb-waiter and the door to HILDEGARDE 'S room is a large mission cupboard . There are five chairs in the room . Three are around the table , and one is placed before the typewriting stand . There is a hatrack upon the wall next to the hall door.It is about eleven-thirty in the morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , and the room is very light.Off rear a hand-organ is heard playing . HILDEGARDE is discovered at the typewriter . She works on , disregarding the hum of incoherent tenement life about her . The organ stops . A street vendor is heard hoarsely crying his wares : VENDOR 'S VOICE Off . Apples ! Apples ! Ten cents a qu-a-art ! p. 67 WOMAN 'S VOICE Off . Hey-hey ! Epples ! Yas  --  you ! Noomber seven ! A helfft quart ! VENDOR 'S VOICE Off . All right , number seven ! WOMAN 'S VOICE Off . I schick de nikkel down . The VENDOR 'S voice ceases . Suddenly the sound of a window crashing is heard quite close . HILDEGARDE pauses attentively . LAWRENCE bursts into the room from the left . He appears in a dressing gown , with a ball in his hand . He is shaved , but still has lather on his face . LAWRENCE Look here ! HILDEGARDE Was it your window ? LAWRENCE Almost my head . Say , does anybody own those brats ? HILDEGARDE Goes quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Vincent ! Joey ; Do n't run away . I told you , you must n't play ball in the court . I 'll have to tell your mothers . LAWRENCE Giving her the ball , which she puts on a shelf . A lot of good that 'll do . HILDEGARDE It 's hard to be severe with them . LAWRENCE goes toward the bathroom . They ought n't play in the street . Little Jamie Kirk was killed by a car last week . p. 68 LAWRENCE There 's plenty of them left . The dumb-waiter whistle gives a piercing scream . What 's loose again ? He opens the tube , listens-and yells down . No ! do n't want any apples ! HILDEGARDE Opening dumb-waiter . Wait , Lawrence . She calls down quietly . Mrs. Pannakin is number seven on the other side . Shuts dumb-waiter door . Will you have breakfast now ? LAWRENCE What time is it ? HILDEGARDE Taking screen away from stove . About half-past eleven . She tries to light gas-stove . LAWRENCE We 've got to hurry . Turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Have you a quarter ? LAWRENCE Giving her a coin . No credit there , eh ! He goes into bathroom . She gets up on chair and puts coin in the meter , winds it and proceeds to heat the coffee . HILDEGARDE Calling to him . It 'll be ready in a moment . You finish dressing . LAWRENCE enters from the bathroom with a towel , drying his face . p. 69 LAWRENCE What have you ordered for lunch ? HILDEGARDE I told Mrs. Pannakin to take especial pains to-day . LAWRENCE Grimly disgusted . Mrs. Knollys will enjoy one of Mrs. Pannakin 's co-operative dinners ; where all the last week 's vegetables co-operate to make this week 's soups . I wonder why they want to come here anyway . HILDEGARDE Slowly . I ca n't imagine . LAWRENCE Reproachfully . You invited them . I tried to head it off . HILDEGARDE They are your friends ; and you know I never miss a chance of interesting rich people in this philanthropy . Go , dear , and finish dressing . He exits to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , folds and signs it , then addresses it in an envelope , and stamps it . She hums while she works . LAWRENCE re-enters carrying his collar , tie , coat and vest . He wrestles with his collar and then throws the other things down . LAWRENCE This life is killing me ! I 'm as nervous as a cat ! HILDEGARDE Did n't you sleep well ? LAWRENCE Pointing to the typewriter . Sleep ! What time was it when you began banging that instrument of torture ? p. 70 HILDEGARDE I had to get my copy ready for this evening 's edition . LAWRENCE Continuing to dress . What is it ? HILDEGARDE A report of last evening 's Labor Meeting for Krellin 's column . LAWRENCE You know , you 'll have to stop this kind of thing . That 's if you care anything for me . She gets butter out of improbised ice-box in the wash-tubs . HILDEGARDE Cheerfully . My little writing and my job here are at present our only means of support . She puts butter on table . LAWRENCE Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm sorry enough to see you slave the way you do ; but Krellin and your friends are attacking the very people from whom I 'm going to get my living . HILDEGARDE Cheerfully . Yes , Mrs. Knollys took the trouble to inform me of that some weeks ago . LAWRENCE Well , they do n't like to hear how their money is made . HILDEGARDE There 's very little danger of their listening to me . LAWRENCE And how about Mr. Knollys ? p. 71 HILDEGARDE He and I understand each other completely . LAWRENCE Yes , no doubt . But this is how it 's worked out for me . I 've finished the preliminary plans , and should have got the first instalment to begin my work three days ago . HILDEGARDE Well ? LAWRENCE Continuing . Your articles have driven him down South , to look over that factory of his . HILDEGARDE Oh , I 'm glad of that . LAWRENCE I 'm glad you 're glad . But I get not a cent till he O.K. 's the plans . HILDEGARDE Cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LAWRENCE He was expected yesterday . Turning away . Oh , I do n't want a lot of breakfast . I 'm rickety ! I 'm all in ! Just give me some coffee ! HILDEGARDE Getting coffee from gas-stove . It 's ready now . Pouring it . Where do you go to-night ? LAWRENCE Mrs. Millette . HILDEGARDE Mrs. Who ? LAWRENCE Millette ,  --  what 's the difference what her name is ? Mrs. Knollys says she wants to build a house . p. 72 HILDEGARDE Good . LAWRENCE I 'm invited to dine with her and go to the play to-night to talk things over . HILDEGARDE Any prospects ? LAWRENCE With a tone of justification . There 's a social side to my job . You must see that . I 've got to make that solid first . HILDEGARDE Yes . Pause . LAWRENCE Why ? You 're not offended that you 're not asked , are you ? HILDEGARDE Oh , dear no ; I 'm thinking only of what they 'll think of you . LAWRENCE In what way ? HILDEGARDE I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man these woman can invite without his wife . LAWRENCE And I do n't want to be known as the kind of man that always drags his wife about , either . He opens the newspaper . HILDEGARDE It 's an affront to you , not to me . The bell rings over the hall door . Opening the door . Oh , thank you . Takes letters from some one outside . Wait , will you drop this in the mail for me ? She fetches her typewritten article and an orange . As she passes LAWRENCE she says : These are for you . She gives him some letters . Then she returns , to the door and gives the letter and the orange to the little girl evidently standing outside . Here , Annie . Thank you . She closes the door . p. 73 LAWRENCE Reading a letter which he has opened during the above business . From my old firm . Proudly . They offer me a raise of ten a week if I 'll come back . HILDEGARDE Looking through her mail . Bills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LAWRENCE They 'll have to wait . I 've got to . Showing his letter . How would you answer them ? HILDEGARDE That you must decide yourself . LAWRENCE Pointing to the bills humorously . Say , ai n't it the devil how the money goes ? HILDEGARDE With a smile . I can manage the necessities ; if you 'll keep down the luxuries . LAWRENCE Looking at a bill . Seven dollars and fifty cents for flowers . Looks up at her . HILDEGARDE To whom did you send them ? LAWRENCE Mrs. Knollys , of course . She needs flowers . Always has them . With attempted justification . I eat two meals a day on her ; I 've got to keep my end up some way . p. 74 HILDEGARDE Certainly , by all means . LAWRENCE With another letter . Tailor 's bill . One hundred and twenty-five cold plunks . Boyishly . That 's the swell dress suit , all right . Looks at her . Do you know , I 'm sometimes tempted to drop in and see my old firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , but  --  HILDEGARDE You might call on them , and tell them what you 're doing . LAWRENCE What do you think ? HILDEGARDE I 'd play the game out for all its worth . It 's no use weakening now . LAWRENCE Pointing to bills . What will we do with these ? HILDEGARDE Encouragingly . We 'll meet them with your first instalment . The bell over the dumb-waiter rings loudly . LAWRENCE Going to dumb-waiter . I 'll open . He opens door . The bell continues its ringing . VOICE Below , yelling up . Sanbury ? LAWRENCE Shouting down . Yes . Roaring . Take your finger off that bell ! Bell stops . p. 75 VOICE Cheerily . Thought you might be a-hangin ' out the wash ! LAWRENCE No , I 'm not hangin ' out the wash ! What do you want ? VOICE Look out ! It 's coming up ! ! LAWRENCE just ducks back as the dumb-waiter shoots up . HILDEGARDE It 's the grape-fruit and salad from the grocer 's . LAWRENCE takes it off . Put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the wash-tubs . LAWRENCE What time is it now ? HILDEGARDE After twelve . You 'll have to hurry . LAWRENCE Suddenly . Say , ca n't we have the screens up ? Putting them hastily back before the stove . And you know , there 's nothing very handsome about this view . Jerks down the blind over window rear . HILDEGARDE Larrie , please do n't fuss . He has gone quickly for his coat hanging on a peg behind his door . He re-enters struggling into his coat . LAWRENCE Say , my room looks like hell ! HILDEGARDE Agnes will clear it up while I 'm setting the table . p. 76 LAWRENCE Nervously . Where is she ? You know she never comes when you want her ! HILDEGARDE Clearing table quietly . She 'll be here . LAWRENCE Attempting to fix a picture straight on the wall . Have all your orders come ? HILDEGARDE Yes . Please do n't get nervous . LAWRENCE Turning nervously . Well , I 'm only trying to help you out . I pass the grocer 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't help fussing . LAWRENCE I like things to be right . Suddenly . Are you going to wear that dress ? HILDEGARDE What 's the matter with my dress ? LAWRENCE Dubiously . Oh , I suppose it 's all right ; only I thought your green  --  and honestly now , your feet are n't as big as that . It 's those Consumer 's League boots , just like your gloves ! You 'd wear anything with a Trade Union label on it , would n't you ? No matter what it looked like ! HILDEGARDE They wo n't see my feet . p. 77 LAWRENCE Wo n't they ? Exploding . That skirt hikes ! ! HILDEGARDE With an obvious effort to be patient . I 'll be all right ; if you 'll only get out before you make me nervous . A bell rings . He goes toward dumb-waiter again . Lifting the blind he has pulled down . No . That 's the door . I guess it 's Agnes . LAWRENCE I hope so . He opens the hall door and MURTHA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Effusively . Th ' top o ' the marnin ' to you , Mishter Sanbury ! Seeing HILDEGARDE . Ah , Sishter ! Shure , yer hushband do be lookin ' loike a capitalisht to-day . Shakes both her hands . LAWRENCE Where 's Agnes ? MURTHA With feigned surprise . Ah , Agnes , is it ? Cunningly . Shure , she 's all roight . She do be havin ' th ' gran ' good loock to-day ! LAWRENCE Where is she ? MURTHA She 's got a job-to-day , this , wid Mishter Curtis , her auld boss . p. 78 HILDEGARDE Why did n't you tell me she could n't come ? MURTHA Oi would n't dishappoint ye . Oi know yer goin ' to have a shindy ; and is it any wonder that Oi 'm here before th ' wind . HILDEGARDE Practically . Then go right to Mr. Sanbury 's room and clear it up . MURTHA Shure Oi will ; whoy would n't Oi ? She exit left with aged agility . LAWRENCE Ca n't you get rid of her ? HILDEGARDE I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sight of her . To the ceiling . Oh , we 're going to have a lovely party ! HILDEGARDE Nervously . Then call it off entirely . LAWRENCE I tried to . But she was determined to come here to-day . HILDEGARDE Abruptly . Then stop complaining ! I wish you 'd go ! Seeing the futility of chiding him , she changes to a very reassuring manner . Now go , dear . You look very handsome . She adjusts his necktie and goes with him toward hall door . He has his hands in his pockets . p. 79 LAWRENCE Do I look like ready money ? HILDEGARDE Laughing . Yes . LAWRENCE Shamefaced . Well , I have n't got any . Mine 's in the gas meter . HILDEGARDE How much will you need ? LAWRENCE I 've got to get those dames here , have n't I ? And I might be stuck for a taxicab . You know , such things have happened ! HILDEGARDE Going to cupboard . Wait . She brings out a china bank and shakes it . LAWRENCE What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There must be several dollars in it . She breaks it with a knife ; and a mass of small coins is exposed . LAWRENCE Sweeping up the coins . I feel like a man that 's robbed a nursery . As he puts them uncounted into his pocket , some of them roll on the floor . HILDEGARDE The grocer will be glad to give you bills . LAWRENCE It ' ud take me an hour to count up this chicken feed . Suddenly . There 's some on the floor . As he starts to lean over , his soft hat falls from his head . He steps on it . Gad ! ! Sure thing ! This is my lucky day ! He punches his hat savagely . p. 80 HILDEGARDE I 'll pick it up . She does so . Larrie dear , will you let me say something ? And you wo n't get angry ? LAWRENCE Defensively . Well ? HILDEGARDE Going to him . Dearest , first try to be calm  --  for your own sake , do n't be irritated . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but all these little things HILDEGARDE I know , dear , it is hard ; but for the sake of my pride in you , be careful about showing any impatience to me , particularly in front of Mrs. Knollys . I do n't care how angry you get when we 're alone . I understand . She does n't . And judging from the last time she saw us together , she might think LAWRENCE Please do n't refer to that again . I thought you had forgotten it . Contritely . I lost my head . HILDEGARDE If you remember it , I shall forget it . She kisses him . Now , good-by , dear . LAWRENCE Good-by . He exits through the hall door , as MURTHA re-enters from his room at the left . p. 81 MURTHA That 's done . HILDEGARDE Then you can lay the table . MURTHA Shure Oi will , me dear . She goes quickly to the cupboard for the necessary things . While MURTHA is busied at the table , center , HILDEGARDE gets the salad and grap-fruit from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene . HILDEGARDE You know , Mrs. Murtha , it is n't quite honest for you to say that Agnes will go to places , and then you go to them yourself . MURTHA Busying herself at table . No , ma 'm . She crosses herself with a mechanically devout expression . HILDEGARDE Then why do you do it ? MURTHA Whoy would n't Oi ? There 's Aggie , th ' Lord love her , can hardly keep herself , and Tim 's no good at all , and Mary in th ' hoshpital , and Joey wid th ' haughty lady that he 's married and th ' twins ! HILDEGARDE But are n't you getting a little too old for ? MURTHA Interrupting savagely . There yer sayin ' it ! And d'ye see , if Oi wuz to tell thim : " It 's me , ma 'm , that 's lookin ' fer th ' job , " Oi 'd nivir git it ! And a little loi loike that doa n't hurrt . Wheedling . Fer Oi 'm as shtrong as ivir Oi wuz. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knives on the right side . MURTHA Very gently . Yis , ma 'm . Pause . HILDEGARDE Have you ever waited on a table ? MURTHA Me ! Naw , ma 'm . HILDEGARDE Pausing . Then perhaps  --  MURTHA Confidently , while HILDEGARDE works at straightening out the table . Ah , ye jusht tell me what to do , and Oi kin do it . Shure , Oi 'm not wan av thim thick Micks . HILDEGARDE Then first of all you must roll down your sleeves . MURTHA Obeying like a child . Yis , ma 'm . Yer a laidy . Oi ca n't say naw liss than that . HILDEGARDE Smiling . What is a lady ? MURTHA Ha ! A laidy is wan av thim that has all th ' beer an ' skittles , an ' doa n't have to do no worrk . Laughing . Shure , Oi always says moy auld man 's th ' loocky laidy av our house .

HILDEGARDE You just bring the things from Mrs. Pannakin to me . MURTHA Yis , ma 'm . HILDEGARDE And if there 's anything you do n't know how to do , you just ask me quietly , and I 'll tell you . MURTHA Yis , ma 'm . She pricks up her ears . What wuz that ! ! ! She makes a dive for the window rear and looks out . That 's Mickey Doolan ! Shure it 's Doolan ! ! She flings open the window . As she does so , a violent quarrel in Irish between a man and woman is heard . MURTHA yells out : Mickey ! Mickey ! ! You lave her be ! Solemnly . Moy Gawd ! He 's hit her , th ' poor woman , and she wid th ' young un comin ' ! She jumps up on the sill . Mickey ! Mickey ! ! You lave her be ! ! Fer th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' man , you let her be ! ! You dhrunken pesht ! DURING the above speech , HILDEGARDE has tried vainly to hold MURTHA back and stop her yelling ; but MURTHA has got speechless with rage . She tears loose from HILDEGARDE , goes through the window and is heard clattering down the fire-escape execrating DOOLAN. p. 84 HILDEGARDE Calling . Mrs. Murtha ! ! Wait  --  Mrs. Murtha ! ! ! MURTHA has disappeared into the mle . The row is heard suddenly to increase with MURTHA 's advent . A woman 's shrill scream is heard , and than a man 's growl . The row increases . HILDEGARDE , seeing the futility of trying to control things at a distance , decides to follow . She also exits over the fire-escape , and descends . MURTHA 's high voice is heard above the noise , calling for " Tim . " Then some other woman 's voices are heard in high excitement calling . A hushed subsidence due to HILDEGARDE 'S appearance follows . Finally an absolute pause of silence . Then a key is heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The door opens . Whistling is heard on the steps . The whistling evidently is paced to keep time with some one climbing slowly up stairs . LAWRENCE enters . BOYS ' VOICES Outside , heard as the door opens . Give us the ball ! You got it ! LAWRENCE Go on , boys , chase yourselves . To CAROLINE . Come in . CAROLINE enters . BOYS ' VOICES Derisively . Git a hair-cut ! Git a hair-cut ! G'wan , you dude ! LAWRENCE Closing the door . This is the living room . Plain living and high thinking . p. 85 CAROLINE Laughing . I should admit it 's rather high . LAWRENCE Calling . Hildegarde ! We 're here ! To CAROLINE . Sit down , please . CAROLINE Not sitting . Are you sure that she expected me ? LAWRENCE Certainly . She may be in my room . Crosses left and opens his door . CAROLINE Crossing . I want to see where you sleep . LAWRENCE Behold my couch of dreams . CAROLINE Murmuring . You poor boy ! LAWRENCE Closing window rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as I 've a place to work in . He starts to pull down the blind . CAROLINE What 's there ? LAWRENCE Cheerfully . Excellent view of a fire-escape and Mrs. Pannakin 's kitchen , where our nectar and ambrosia are prepared ; which later you are to be privileged to taste . CAROLINE After looking . Ah ! p. 86 LAWRENCE He pulls down the blind . Then he goes toward HILDEGARDE 'S room at right , calling . Hildegarde ! CAROLINE Insinuatingly . Do you object to this little chat with me alone ? LAWRENCE Of course not ! But I wanted to leave you here with Hildegarde , while I looked for Miss Ambie . She may have trouble finding us . CAROLINE I hope so . He looks at her . I have trouble enough in losing her . LAWRENCE Laughing . Do you know , you sometimes perplex me terribly ? CAROLINE Sitting . Do I ? Smiles . Sit down and let me look at you . He sits and looks at her inquiringly . I want to see if I can fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? LAWRENCE Oh , Caroline , you 're so used to luxury , you ca n't understand how a little plain living rather helps a fellow to dream true . That 's why I did n't want you to come down . I was afraid it would discourage you . CAROLINE Slowly and with a caressing glance . It has made many things about you very clear to me. p. 87 LAWRENCE There 's nothing complex about me . CAROLINE Yes , if you can do what you have done down here , what will you do , when  --  ? Oh , it 's only because you are you that all this squalor has n't killed your genius ! LAWRENCE Humorously . Oh , come now , Caroline , it 's hard for me not to agree with you when you speak of me as a genius and all that . I tell you frankly I adore it ; but I 'm really quite an ordinary sort of a chap . I 've got enough ambition and enthusiasm to draw cheques on my future . I hope I 've learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll be able to measure up to my opportunities . And  --  when I 'm with you , I feel my luck is with me . CAROLINE Then my faith in you does really help you , does it ? LAWRENCE How can you ask that ? CAROLINE Keep your confidence , Lawrence , but remember that patience is a virtue of the underlings . I do n't possess that virtue ; and you can not afford to . LAWRENCE What 's that to do with it ? CAROLINE Vehemently . Oh , I ca n't bear to see you in circumstances like these ! I ca n't lie to you ! It 's useless to disguise it . I hate to see you pulling down the blinds ! I hate anything that ties you here ! The world is full of people that can plod and wait for opportunities . We 've got to make them and before it is too late ! I knew that you had wings the first time that I saw you . I hate the idea of a half a loaf , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are entitled to the whole ! I hate even the patchwork you 're doing on my house ! She rises . p. 88 LAWRENCE Do n't say that ! The work you 've given me has enabled me to leave my firm with a free conscience . CAROLINE Smiling . What have you to do with conscience ? People have conscience only when they fail . LAWRENCE Rising . By Jove , you have a liberating way of saying things ! CAROLINE Have I helped to liberate you ? LAWRENCE I 've chucked a lot of litter since I 've met you . CAROLINE That 's right . I love to hear you say that . Oh , I want to see you free  --  free from all the petty scruples that would hinder you ! That 's my work now . For while you 're building houses , I shall be building your career . LAWRENCE takes her enthusiastically and impulsively into his arms , and kisses her full on the mouth . He looks at her as if hypnotized . She is full of the disguised triumph in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbing realization of what he has done . LAWRENCE I beg your pardon . CAROLINE For what ? LAWRENCE Forgive me . I had no right to  --  p. 89 CAROLINE Interrupting . You have a right to everything if you only want it enough ! Passionately . I want you  --  Quickly correcting herself . I want you to succeed ; and we shall find a means . Suddenly . You must get that studio immediately . LAWRENCE Dazed . What  --  ? CAROLINE In a low voice . You ca n't work any longer at my house . He looks up . Hubert arrives to-day . LAWRENCE Absently . Good ! CAROLINE A little less enthusiasm , please . LAWRENCE I mean , then I can get his O.K. on the plans . CAROLINE You 'll get your first instalment to-morrow . You 've got to draw up plans of an Italian country house for Edwalyn Millette . LAWRENCE She has decided ? CAROLINE She will . She has money ; and I can tell her exactly what she thinks she wants . Humorously . There I can help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know exactly how we 'll furnish it . I know just where I shall sit and pour your tea . The bell rings over the door . They start . And we wo n't have bells like that ! p. 90 LAWRENCE That 's Hildegarde . Turning . I 'll tell her of the studio . CAROLINE Quickly . Not a word . Leave that to me . He hesitates . Oh , we drive to Edwalyn 's Long Island place this afternoon . I want you to see the grounds before you dine with her to-night . LAWRENCE Oh , all right . He opens the door to the hall , and discovers SUSAN AMBIE . Come in , Miss Ambie . AMBIE Entering , her hat away . Oh , there you are ! Grieved . Well , Carrie , I must say  --  CAROLINE We decided you were n't coming . AMBIE Looking at her watch . I thought I was on time . CAROLINE Think again , my dear . LAWRENCE Did you have trouble finding us ? AMBIE Straightening her hat and speaking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the street . Their ball just missed me ! CAROLINE Too bad ! Too bad ! AMBIE Carrie , I 've something I must say to you Looks significantly at LAWRENCE . p. 91 LAWRENCE Excuse me . I 'll hunt up Hildegarde . She may be in her office . As soon as LAWRENCE exits SUSAN betrays a most uncontrolled and nervous anxiety . She is nervous almost to the point of incoherency . CAROLINE Well , what is it ? AMBIE Carrie , I 'm sorry but I have n't slept ! I ca n't take any more responsibility . That 's all . CAROLINE Then do n't . AMBIE On the raw . They ask me if I 'm blind ! ! CAROLINE Well , if you 're not , what do you care ? AMBIE Gushily . People are talking about you and Lawrence . Of course , I understand  --  but CAROLINE Interrupting . If you give your time thinking about what other people say , you 'll never have time for anything else . AMBIE Impatiently . But people know that Hubert 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and CAROLINE There 's comfort in that . Just think what they imagine when they do n't see us. p. 92 AMBIE My dear , you ca n't stop wicked tongues from wagging . Of course , I tried to defend you all I could . People are saying that you 've lost your head over this young architect that you have living with you in your house . Everybody 's talking  --  CAROLINE Everybody has nothing else to do . AMBIE Where is his wife ? Perhaps she 's heard things and means to be rude ! CAROLINE Rude to me ? She could n't be . AMBIE You know , Lawrence tried to discourage our coming . What can you and she have in common ? CAROLINE Meaningly . Nothing ! Lawrence sees that already . When she realizes that we can have nothing in common  --  not ever her  --  well , the rest is easy . AMBIE Alarmed . Carrie ! You 're up to something mad ! CAROLINE laughs . I have n't seen you look or act like this , not since Italy ! Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's true ! ! CAROLINE Calmly . What ? AMBIE You 've lost your head about him . p. 93 CAROLINE Recklessly . Oh , there 's no law against a woman losing her head . AMBIE But his wife ! What do you mean to do ? CAROLINE I ? Nothing . AMBIE Carrie , come back with me . We 'll leave our cards ; and we 'll have done our duty . CAROLINE Go if you like . AMBIE With a nervous whimper . I wo n't desert you , Carrie ! CAROLINE Rising . Oh , then shut up ! AMBIE Do n't be rash , dear , she may know more than you think . CAROLINE In big things I do nothing underhand . There is heard a fearful shaking of the window . AMBIE What 's that ! ! CAROLINE I 'll see . She goes toward window rear , pulls up the blind . The person outside on the fire-escape flings up the window and scrambles into the room . AMBIE Tearfully . During CAROLINE 'S movement . I do n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MURTHA . The gorilla ! AMBIE Frightened . Carrie , this is the way out ! MURTHA has scrambled into the room talking incoherently to herself . She looks rather damaged , and is carrying her apron and purse in her hand . Her hair is tousled and her eye is red . MURTHA Recognizing CAROLINE . Ah , fer th ' love o ' God , Mrs. Knowllez , is it you ! D'ye see me oye ? Pointing to it . That 's phwat ye git whin ye come interferin ' between a husband and a woife ! Shure , it wuz her that guv me that . Laughing . Hah , there wuz wigs on th ' green ! I licked him wance before , and Mrs. Doolan she knows it , moind ye ; and whin I wuz trou ' wid him , a dog would n't ha ' lapped his blood ! CAROLINE and SUSAN have tried in vain to retreat before MURTHA 'S stream of hysterical verbiage . AMBIE Completely appalled . Yes , that 's all very interesting ! Retreats around table . MURTHA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talkin ' to mesilf , and Oi could n't find a bigger fool to talk to . She opens a purse she still carries in her hand , sees her money . Ah , that 's all roight . She puts purse down on the table . CAROLINE and SUSAN are chassing toward the door , which is suddenly opened and HILDEGARDE is heard talking to some one at the entrance . p. 95 HILDEGARDE Calling in . Mrs. Murtha , go bathe that eye in cold water . MURTHA Subdued immediately . Yis , ma 'm . She goes to the sink and does so . HILDEGARDE Continuing to some one outside . No , Doolan ; if you 're sobered up at four o'clock , come to my office . The ejection officer will be there . She closes the door sharply as she enters , then suddenly sees CAROLINE and SUSAN . She continues with complete composure . Oh ! Shakes hands with CAROLINE . I 'm sorry I was n't here to receive you . Shakes hands with SUSAN . I hope you 'll forgive me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our tenants . Excuse me ! CAROLINE Certainly . HILDEGARDE exits into her room . CAROLINE and SUSAN look at each other while the noise of running water is heard at the sink , where MURTHA is bathing her eye . SUSAN is frightened . CAROLINE is enjoying her usual parasitic amusement . AMBIE What do you think , Carrie ? CAROLINE The worse it is , the better I like it . HILDEGARDE immediately re-enters with a small bottle and some lint , which she puts down on the table . p. 96 HILDEGARDE To CAROLINE and SUSAN . Wo n't you lay off your wraps in Larrie 's room ? Pointing left . SUSAN passes and enters the room at left . Continues . I 'm sure there 's more excitement than real injury . CAROLINE goes toward room . HILDEGARDE takes a bowl from plate rack and moves to MURTHA . CAROLINE To SUSAN whose train is still visible showing the smallness of the room . Susan , go in . AMBIE Excitedly . I ca n't walk through the wall , my dear . The train is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door behind her . MURTHA Oh , me oye  --  me oye ! HILDEGARDE To MURTHA . Now quick , let me look at that eye . MURTHA Shure Oi will , me dear ! HILDEGARDE Bathe it with this stuff . Here , use this too . Going to table to get the lint pad , she sees MURTHA 'S purse . Oh , you 've found your purse . Where was it ? MURTHA Guiltily . I must ha ' dhropped it runnin down . p. 97 HILDEGARDE You see you were wrong to accuse Mrs. Doolan . That only made more trouble . MURTHA Cannily . It wuz th ' loocky thing thim Polacks did n't know ' t was loyin ' jusht outside their window . LAWRENCE enters from the hall door . LAWRENCE To HILDEGARDE . Where have you been ? MURTHA Groaning . Oh , Mother ! Me oye me oye . She sits wretchedly at the left . LAWRENCE What 's the matter ! MURTHA In a loud regretful tone . If I had only hit him whin he thripped ! ! HILDEGARDE There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? HILDEGARDE No . And everything is all right now . LAWRENCE Yes , but where are the ladies ? HILDEGARDE Trying to quiet him by her tone . In your room , laying off their wraps . During the above , MURTHA has been fighting over the battle in pantomine , while bathing her eye , and mumbling to herself . p. 98 LAWRENCE Did you get anybody else to help you ? HILDEGARDE Barely holding her nerves . I 've been quelling a riot ! LAWRENCE Pointing to MURTHA . What are you going to do with her ? HILDEGARDE Go to Mrs. Pannakin 's , and see if she wo n't serve the dinner herself . LAWRENCE I was just there looking for you ! I asked her then . HILDEGARDE Well ? LAWRENCE Throwing up his hands and speaking to the ceiling . She ca n't come ! She is n't dressed ! And dinner 's ready ! ! HILDEGARDE To MURTHA . Go to Mrs. Pannakin 's , smooth your hair , borrow an apron and bring in the dinner . MURTHA Rising . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The durrty A.P.A. ! She crosses to the hall door muttering . Oh , Lord , I 'm as blind as Doolan 's goat ! I 'll nivir see out o ' that oye again To hit me whin Oi was n't lookin ' . She exits . p. 99 LAWRENCE Good Lord ! He swings around the room in an ecstasy of exasperation . HILDEGARDE Going to him . Larrie , no matter what happens , do n't be betrayed into any rudeness to me before Mrs. Knollys . The door left opens and SUSAN enters . HILDEGARDE The excitement has subsided . Wo n't you sit here ? She fixes a chair at her right . SUSAN sits with her back to the door . CAROLINE enters . Continuing . And , Mrs. Knollys , wo n't you sit there ? She motions CAROLINE to the chair at LAWRENCE 'S right . He helps her . She faces the door . HILDEGARDE faces the audience . LAWRENCE has his back to the audience . Note : the LADIES have just removed their wraps . CAROLINE has not taken off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She gets bread and butter from the wash-tubs . How is Mr. Knollys ? CAROLINE Well , thank you , the last I heard . HILDEGARDE Puts the bread on table and helps them to butter . To CAROLINE . Let me help you . We hear the Homestead Mills are going to begin work again . I 'm glad . Sugar ? p. 100 CAROLINE Waving a " no . " And the percentage on investments lowered again . They all , except CAROLINE , eat grape-fruit . AMBIE Changing the conversation . Mrs. Sanbury , have you any nerves left ? HILDEGARDE This is by no means a typical day . CAROLINE No ? HILDEGARDE Many of the workmen living here are idle . Unfortunately , they drink . CAROLINE If that is how they spend their leisure , why agitate for shorter hours and bigger pay ? AMBIE Vigorously . What good bread ! HILDEGARDE Many laboring people drink because they have to work , and  --  CAROLINE Interrupting sarcastically . Precisely , and they do n't like it . I agree with you so far . HILDEGARDE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they have n't decent food . LAWRENCE Rising . That being the case , ladies , I propose we fortify ourselves against the possible vagaries of our co-operative cook . He goes to tubs and takes out bottles . p. 101 AMBIE Looking . Your what ? HILDEGARDE To SUSAN . Perhaps Larrie has told you , this a co-operative dining-room . Several of the people living here chip in to pay the rent . LAWRENCE To CAROLINE . A little Scotch ? She refuses it . He helps SUSAN . CAROLINE To HILDEGARDE . A sort of socialistic mess . AMBIE Incredulously . But you 're not Socialists , are you ? She drops her bread and knife . HILDEGARDE Not all of us . AMBIE Reassured and beginning to eat again . Oh , that 's better . HILDEGARDE But then we 've got an Anarchist or two among us . AMBIE Anxiously , pausing in a mouthful . Oh ! HILDEGARDE Continuing . All interested in improving conditions . AMBIE Approving charitably . Ah . She resumes eating . p. 102 LAWRENCE Rising . Psh ! Mysteriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he goes to the hall door and opens it . I 've got a long distance nose ! The soup ! ! He returns to his chair as MURTHA enters carrying four soup-bowls on a very presentable tray . She never takes her eyes from HILDEGARDE . MURTHA is very neat and important . HILDEGARDE motions her to serve her first . MURTHA does so . AMBIE Seeing MURTHA . Oh , she 's all right again . I 'm glad . HILDEGARDE To MURTHA . Then serve Mrs. Knollys . CAROLINE Waving a gloved hand . I never eat soup . MURTHA goes to SUSAN and helps her , then LAWRENCE . She stands awkwardly for a moment , but very quietly . HILDEGARDE To MURTHA . You can come back in a moment and clear off the bowls . MURTHA Yis , ma 'm . HILDEGARDE Leave the door ajar . MURTHA is about to exit , carrying the tray with CAROLINE 'S bowl of soup on it , when she is passed in the door by MICHAEL KRELLIN . KRELLIN is a Russian by birth , but speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slightly foreign accent . Physically , he is of medium height , lithe and slender in figure , rapid and exact in his movements . His dress is clean but careless . Everything about him betokens a fearless definiteness of mind . He has a shock of curly hair . His face is pale , his eyes are very keen ; and when he looks at a person , he is likely to peer a little closer into their faces than the usual man . His speech is fluent and incisive . He is mentally a combination of the political dreamer and the practical meliorist , who has saved his optimism by fighting for the next reform at his hand . His manner is above all things humorous and easy , with a sort of detached impersonal impertinence . He has the assurance of the platform orator . p. 103 MURTHA Meeting him at the door . Good marnin ' , Mishter Krellin . KRELLIN Good morning . Eh ? Wait ! Stops MURTHA and peers into the tray . LAWRENCE To CAROLINE . There 's our Anarchist . HILDEGARDE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello ! I 'll take that soup . He has already deftly lifted it from the tray . MURTHA Doa n't let yer modesty wrong you . She exits . KRELLIN Joyously . Hildegarde , Hildegarde ! I 've news for you ! Good news ! He goes immediately to the cupboard , puts down his soup-bowl deftly , pulls out a drawer , finds his napkin with a cheap ring on it , picks out a knife , fork and spoon , puts the napkin in his mouth , takes the bowl , with knife , fork and spoon in one hand , then picks up a chair with his remaining hand and advances toward the table . HILDEGARDE Hesitatingly . Yes , Michael KRELLIN During the above business . Just wait . I 'm as hungry as a wolf . All night at the office . p. 104 HILDEGARDE You must be tired , Michael . KRELLIN His voice is merry , but his body is relaxed . Not very . He puts down his chair between SUSAN 'S and HILDEGARDE 'S , and places his eating paraphernalia on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . CAROLINE is imperturbed . LAWRENCE is annoyed . KRELLIN Peering near-sightedly at SUSAN . Oh , you 're having a party . I did n't see . Rising . Pardon , I am very near-sighted ; and I have broken my glasses . About to withdraw . I 'll step in later . HILDEGARDE Wait , Michael . To CAROLINE and SUSAN . Mr. Krellin is one of our friends . KRELLIN Yes , yes . I only wanted to ask ; did you finish your article ? HILDEGARDE Yes . It 's gone . What 's the news ? KRELLIN You 'll have to write a special . Despatches from the South tell of the final settlement by arbitration with the Homestead Mills . Another victory ! He shakes HILDEGARDE 'S hands enthusiastically . HILDEGARDE Splendid , but  --  Turns toward CAROLINE. p. 105 KRELLIN Continuing . A ten hour day , and a dollar ninety cents ! LAWRENCE The Homestead Mills ! those are Turning to CAROLINE . CAROLINE Yes , I 'm interested . HILDEGARDE My friend is one of the reporters on the " ECHO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present him ? CAROLINE And which way has the strike been settled ? KRELLIN Coming toward her . You will be glad to hear in favor of the shorter hour and the living wage . Another milestone passed ! HILDEGARDE Mrs. Knollys , this is Mr. Krellin . A member of our co-operative club . We do n't usually have the pleasure of seeing him till dinner time . KRELLIN Has leaned toward CAROLINE . Mrs. Knollys Knollys ? Peers at her , then at HILDEGARDE , then again at CAROLINE . I am delighted to find you here . Laughs softly . God is a great dramatist ! CAROLINE Why ? KRELLIN I 've seen you before , Madame ; and I 've heard of your husband . p. 106 HILDEGARDE Quickly . And this is Miss Ambie . KRELLIN Bowing . Ah , yes Miss Ah He goes toward her . AMBIE Frightened . How do you do ! KRELLIN sits between HILDEGARDE and SUSAN . Pause . KRELLIN Partially rising with his knife in hand and peering . Is that the butter ? He takes some and puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in his chair . Mrs. Knollys , I put you on your guard . Before you know it , Hildegarde will persuade you to invest in tenements and make you a five per cent , philanthropist . LAWRENCE Decidedly . No , she wo n't ! She  --  KRELLIN Interrupting . Wait ! She will induce you to put up better dwellings for the poor ; so they can live a little more decently on their miserable wages . You will feel charitable towards them , because they will give you a steady five per cent. ; and the workingmen will be made more contented with conditions , that otherwise they might be encouraged to radically change . p. 107 AMBIE Horrified . But do n't you believe in charity ? KRELLIN Throwing up his hands . Ah , I see ! Another sentimentalist . I surrender ! AMBIE I 'm no such thing ! KRELLIN Gracefully looking at SUSAN and CAROLINE . But neither of you is old enough to be the real conservative . CAROLINE Smiling . You 're a radical ? KRELLIN I am a social physician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in wasting time disguising or trying to cure symptoms . Poverty is the real disease . CAROLINE Other people have a name for your kind of man . KRELLIN They call us lots of names . Which one ? CAROLINE They call you " muck-rakers . " KRELLIN Good humoredly . Oh , that never offends me . To make all beautiful things grow , there must be some one to stir up ah unappetizing things about the roots . We do that . Pointing to CAROLINE . Unfortunately , however , it is the " other " people that wear the flowers . So ! He eats his soup . p. 108 LAWRENCE You must n't take him seriously , Mrs. Knollys . KRELLIN Never listen to the artists . They must take nothing seriously ; else they could find very little beauty in anything . They are spiritual toy-makers and seducers . They gather the flowers and forget the roots . At least do n't take them seriously when they speak . Admire them when they do ; because they are permitted to do , and do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak ; because the government will allow us no other liberty . Eats . LAWRENCE Nonsense , Michael . KRELLIN Appealing to CAROLINE . You see , that is my great misfortune . My friends never know when I am in earnest . What else is there to eat ? At this moment MURTHA appears with a tray on which are chops and vegetables . HILDEGARDE To MURTHA . Take these things off before you serve the chops . MURTHA , without a word , puts the tray on the cup-board , and deftly removes the empty soup-bowls . KRELLIN To HILDEGARDE . Emmy will be late . MURTHA during the next speeches serves chops. p. 109 CAROLINE Resuming . Do you take yourself seriously , Mr. Krellin ? KRELLIN With a quick glance . That means you do n't . But I did once . That 's why I left Russia . HILDEGARDE Mr. Krellin wrote a book for the Radical movement , and the government did n't like it . CAROLINE Wise government . Henceforward LAWRENCE and CAROLINE form a party against HILDEGARDE and KRELLIN . KRELLIN Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot for me ; and Siberia has always been too cold ; and  --  CAROLINE Interrupting . So you decided to make trouble over here . SUSAN has got an eating devil and is despatching food . KRELLIN Precisely . CAROLINE And in that work , do you take other people seriously ? KRELLIN Sometimes . You see , I am neither an artist Bowing to LAWRENCEnor a sentimentalist Bowing to SUSAN . AMBIE Putting down her knife and fork . Now he means me again , Carrie ! p. 110 CAROLINE To KRELLIN . Then you and I might understand each other . KRELLIN Ah ,  --  you must n't ask me to take you seriously , Mrs. Knollys ; that would be too much to ask . CAROLINE Why ? KRELLIN You see , I know you . You 're a spoiled American woman ; which means you take neither our government nor yourself seriously . I do n't blame you ; neither do I. In other words , we have a sense of humor . And then you are a Saxon woman ; which means to a Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a virtue . Otherwise you could never do as you do . He eats . LAWRENCE Growing nervous . For heaven 's sake , stop him ! HILDEGARDE Please , Michael , eat . LAWRENCE To CAROLINE . He 's our interminable talker . HILDEGARDE Laughing a little nervously and speaking to CAROLINE . People say anything they think here . KRELLIN In the midst of a mouthful . Yes , when they think ! Then to SUSAN . When they think ! p. 111 HILDEGARDE But we try to argue about principles , not persons . CAROLINE But I 'm not interested in principles . KRELLIN To CAROLINE . Right you are ! Only involve people in principles , and you keep them harmless . CAROLINE To KRELLIN . But do go on . You said you saw me once before . KRELLIN Yes . I was detailed at the dock when you arrived . CAROLINE Not so pleasantly . Oh . SUSAN puts down her knife and fork again . KRELLIN Continuing . And a dear , a very dear friend persuaded me to lose fifteen dollars on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed . KRELLIN Ah , yes , I had a beautiful article written , which for her sake , I was weak enough to drop an article about the humor and hypocrisy of the American woman ,  --  with special reference to yourself , Mrs. Knollys LAWRENCE is fearful , pushes back his chair . CAROLINE has waved aside the chop and peas that MURTHA has offered her . To MURTHA . Bring that to me . I 've had no breakfast . During the next speeches he has the business of taking CAROLINE 'S chop , etc . Shall I continue ? p. 112 LAWRENCE Decidedly . No ! CAROLINE By all means . KRELLIN To the others . You see , she already treats me as an artist . I amuse her . CAROLINE Immensely . KRELLIN That 's why I permit myself to speak . Well , to resume : strange to say , I wrote that the people whose fortunes have been made in industries protected by the government are always the very ones most eager to evade the customs imposed by that government to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Miss Nambie  --  Miss Pambie  --  Miss AMBIE Ambie is my name . KRELLIN Pardon , quite so . I do not include you ; because on that day you personally lost your sense of humor . To CAROLINE . Your money is made in protected tin plate . Your husband 's in protected woollen mills . Laughs . You see , you have a sense of humor and a genius for hypocrisy . Seriously . You do n't respect a government that will let your factories work the poor the way they do . Neither do I. And so you refuse to pay the customs to support that government . No more do I ! p. 113 LAWRENCE Michael ! KRELLIN Continuing unperturbed . I admire you ! Your personal discernment and your sense of humor were almost worth six thousand dollars to you . I admire you personally  --  fifteen dollars worth ; and that 's a great deal for a man who is saving up in order to get married . CAROLINE Quietly leading him on . Oh , you still believe in marriage . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are inconsistent we are interesting . Wisely . You believe in conventions that you do not observe ; I for a time observe conventions in which I do not believe . AMBIE Horrified . Do n't you believe in marriage ? KRELLIN Bowing to her . Oh , yes , as all the unmarried people do . AMBIE I 'm sure I do n't know what you mean , but it makes me very uncomfortable . LAWRENCE Laughing . Gag him ! HILDEGARDE I 'll mix the salad . She gets the salad bowl . MURTHA helps her . p. 114 CAROLINE Then you believe in women too ? KRELLIN Boundlessly . And in every capacity of citizenship . SUSAN pushes back her chair with an exclamation of disgust . KRELLIN continues to CAROLINE . I believe especially in one , the one I 'm going to marry . I believe in eugenics and endowed maternity  --  in everything that makes for a superior humanity . To SUSAN . I believe that by our foolish laws we can sometimes save people from doing what they 'd like to do . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they are . I believe  --  Oh  --  I believe that I 'm a stupid fool for telling you sincerely all that I do believe in  --  and  --  To HILDEGARDE . Do n't put too much vinegar in the dressing . AMBIE Outraged . I 've listened long enough ! CAROLINE Why , Susan ! What 's broke loose in you ? AMBIE I 'm bound to protest ! KRELLIN Ah , then there 's hope for you . AMBIE Scathingly . Oh , I 'm not clever ! but I think your ideas are perfectly ridiculous and detestable  --  all of them ! p. 115 KRELLIN Thank you . I would have doubt of them if you thought otherwise . AMBIE Continuing . And as for women as citizens  --  women voting and doing the work of men Well , it 's bad enough now as it is , when they happen to hold office under the government KRELLIN Amused . I remember . You had difficulty . AMBIE Unheeding his interruption . Yes , we had an experience at the customs ! CAROLINE Warningly . Susan ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived Of all the insolence in office Hah ! If I had my way Stops breathlessly . KRELLIN You did n't have your way . That was the trouble , was n't it ? AMBIE Well , I 'd like to meet her some time face to face  --  That 's all ; when she did n't have her little badge upon her ; and without the authority of the government behind her  --  I 'd KRELLIN Yes  --  yes . Excuse me . The door to the hall has opened and EMILY MADDEN appears . KRELLIN has risen alertly. p. 116 AMBIE Bewildered . What 's the matter ? She continues to talk to CAROLINE . KRELLIN At the door with EMILY . Ah , Emmy , you 're late . He starts to bring her down . She resists a little , seeing strangers present . CAROLINE Seeing EMILY . Susan , you 're a fool ! AMBIE Seated with her back to the door , does n't see MADDEN She continues to CAROLINE , mournfully : I had no right to drink that whisky . It always makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance , and exclaims , terrified : There she is ! ! Do n't you see her ? Crumpled . Oh , Carrie , it 's gone to my head ! ! She makes a mad clutch at her head . CAROLINE Keep quiet ! LAWRENCE To CAROLINE . I 'm so sorry . Then savagely to HILDEGARDE . Now , you see ! He becomes incoherent and swings up rear , sees MURTHA , stops short and goes to window . p. 117 KRELLIN Bringing EMILY down . Emily , there is a lady here , who has just expressed a great desire to meet you . MADDEN Advancing a step . Oh , then , I 'd be deligh  --  She stops and recoils as she recognizes CAROLINE . AMBIE Waving her hands . I 've had quite enough ! I 've had quite enough ! ! She rises as if to go . KRELLIN Gallantly . Mrs. Knollys , Miss Madden is the reason for my belief in marriage . CAROLINE Amused and pausing . Oh ! That is remarkable . She suddenly realizes that a weapon has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . EMILY is in silent desperation . KRELLIN Proudly . It was due to her persuasion that the article I wrote about you was never published in the papers . CAROLINE To EMILY . I am glad of this opportunity to thank Miss Madden for that , and Significantlyfor many other favors . MADDEN Uncertainly . Oh , I am sure I p. 118 KRELLIN To EMILY . I needed you , my dear , to save me from Miss Ambie and defend the government . Miss Ambie agrees with you about the government . To SUSAN . No ? AMBIE Vehemently . I do n't ! KRELLIN To EMILY . She does not ! Another convert ! Gesture of amusement . While Mrs. Knollys and I maintain the government is ridiculous . To CAROLINE . No ? Suddenly remembering . I 'll get a chair . He looks for one , but there are no more . CAROLINE To KRELLIN . Do n't bother , please . Miss Madden can occupy my place . MADDEN Oh , no ! HILDEGARDE To CAROLINE . Please do n't disturb yourself . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LAWRENCE immediately exits left . CAROLINE It wo n't be a new experience for Miss Madden . She has already occupied my place before this , many times ; and for a long time , I have been accustomed to yield to her . p. 119 KRELLIN Perplexed . Is that so ! How ? MADDEN In terror . Oh , Michael , why did I come here ! ! KRELLIN What 's the matter , Emmy ? CAROLINE To EMILY . Have no fear , Miss Madden . Your intended husband believes in women " boundlessly , " and " in every capacity . " He has a sense of humor and admires hypocrites . He will be consistent to his views ; but I am sure he will allow me to be equally consistent with mine . KRELLIN Carte blanche ! Seeing LAWRENCE re-enter with the chair . Here we are . Now we can listen . CAROLINE I have no principles , but I have some prejudices . And either Miss Madden or I must leave the room . AMBIE Oh , Carrie ! KRELLIN What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evasion ! LAWRENCE Quickly . Emily and Michael , you 've said about enough ! Now please go ! He bangs down the chair . HILDEGARDE To LAWRENCE . By no means . Mrs. Knollys will be good enough to explain herself . p. 120 KRELLIN What is your reason , Mrs. Knollys ? CAROLINE Charmingly . Since you insist , it is simply because I refuse to sit at the same table with my husband 's mistress . KRELLIN Dawning . Ha ! ! HILDEGARDE Simultaneously . Oh ! KRELLIN Fiercely . That 's a lie ! A black , malicious lie ! ! CAROLINE Oh , no ! KRELLIN Continuing . She does n't even know your husband ! CAROLINE Confidently taunting . Ask her ! KRELLIN Madame , I am not here to insult her myself ; but to defend her against your attempt to do so . CAROLINE Ask her , and you will learn it was for my husband 's sake that your article was suppressed . But he , no doubt , has paid Miss Madden for any loss you may have suffered . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a most delightful luncheon . My wrap , Lawrence . He exits left . p. 121 KRELLIN Quite aggressive . Mrs. Knollys , of course you can not go until I have relieved your mind from any misapprehensions you may have concerning your husband . CAROLINE But unfortunately I seem to affect Miss Madden disagreeably . LAWRENCE re-enters with wraps . MURTHA Suddenly coming up from the rear . Fer th ' love o ' Gawd , th ' poor gurrl 's goin ' t ' faint ! ! She takes EMILY in her arms . MADDEN Weakly . Take me home , Michael.Oh ! MURTHA Now there , there , there , dearie , doa n't ye moind . KRELLIN To MURTHA . Yes , take Miss Madden home ! ! MADDEN No ! Not without you , Michael ! ! AMBIE Terrified . Carrie , Carrie ! Come with me ! Come home ! ! I 'm sorry we ever came ! These awful people ! ! Gets into her wrap . LAWRENCE Come , Mrs. Knollys . Then to KRELLIN and EMILY . If they have n't sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can not go ! LAWRENCE To KRELLIN . What do you mean ? KRELLIN I have something to say to Mrs. Knollys ! AMBIE As he comes forward . Carrie , if you do n't come , I Weeps in fright . God knows what they will do ! HILDEGARDE Beeseechingly . Michael , go with Emily ! KRELLIN Shaking his mane . Mrs. Knollys has permitted herself to utter a filthy , vicious lie ! And I  --  HILDEGARDE Going to him . But this is not the time to  --  KRELLIN In fury . A filthy LIE ! ! LAWRENCE TO KRELLIN . See here , you ca n't use that kind of language to my friend ! KRELLIN Savagely to LAWRENCE . Your friend ! You little lap-dog ! I want nothing from you ! Just look to yourself ! ! He flings LAWRENCE aside . p. 123 HILDEGARDE Beseechingly . Michael , go with Emily ! She needs you . She turns him around , and he sees EMILY being helped to the door by MURTHA . MADDEN As she leaves with MURTHA . Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I shall give myself the pleasure of continuing this conversation in the presence of your husband . He bows and exits , after MURTHA and EMILY . AMBIE Incoherently . Carrie , here are your things ! Here ! Of all the frightful experiences ! Spinning around . Where 's my glove ? You must get out of this ! ! HILDEGARDE Mrs. Knollys , I must have a word with you . AMBIE Dizzily . Now she 's going to begin ! Why did we ever ? LAWRENCE Angrily . Hildegarde , do n't you think you 'd better drop it ? HILDEGARDE Meaningly . It is n't only in reference to Miss Madden that I wish to speak . p. 124 AMBIE Hysterically . I knew it , Carrie ! To HILDEGARDE . But you 're wrong ! No matter what you think . People have such vile minds ! Specifically . I was with Mrs. Knollys all the time , except once when I took sick . Your husband knows it  --  and so does Mr. Knollys . LAWRENCE What are you talking about ? AMBIE Continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then  --  LAWRENCE Angrily . Say , Miss Ambie , what 's on your mind ? CAROLINE To LAWRENCE . Psch ! AMBIE Collapsing . Oh , everybody 's crazy ! LAWRENCE Disgusted . You 're right there . He turns helplessly . Hildegarde , I hope that . Oh , what 's the use ! CAROLINE Abruptly . Quite so , Lawrence ; get Susan home . SUSAN has got rapidly to the hall door . LAWRENCE But , Hildegarde , I  --  p. 125 CAROLINE Please go . I wish to talk with your wife . LAWRENCE takes his hat . Send the motor back for me immediately . He crosses to the door . There is a look full of crowded meaning between HILDEGARDE and CAROLINE ; then CAROLINE continues to LAWRENCE . Oh , and remember , you have engagements for this afternoon . LAWRENCE exits with SUSAN . HILDEGARDE closes the door after him . There is a pause of sizing up between the two women . Amused . You 're not going to lock me in ; I hope . HILDEGARDE Gravely . No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass out of our lives forever . CAROLINE Your life ? That 's very simple . You have something else to say to me ? HILDEGARDE So many things ,  --  I hardly know where to begin . CAROLINE Let me help you . We 'll eliminate Miss Madden . HILDEGARDE We will not eliminate Miss Madden . We have a different sense of values , you and I ; but we both are married women . Emily is different . She has nothing but her friends , Michael and me . And we together will force you to retract . CAROLINE Retract the truth ! What else ? p. 126 HILDEGARDE And make a full apology to her . CAROLINE I have never apologized in my life . HILDEGARDE Then you have a new experience in store for you . Pause . What was your purpose in coming here to-day ? CAROLINE With charming frankness . You know . My interest in your husband . HILDEGARDE And now , you think you can eliminate me . CAROLINE Why ? Your husband has his own career ; and you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other people 's lives . CAROLINE Yes . We discussed that some time ago . HILDEGARDE You told me then that I might hinder him ,  --  that my very work in the world might be an obstacle , Since then I 've left him free . I have n't influenced him  --  CAROLINE Oh , do n't make virtues of your inabilities . HILDEGARDE You mean ? CAROLINE Do n't boast of what you could n't do . You know you could n't keep him here . Do n't say you did n't want to . That would be weak . p. 127 HILDEGARDE I do n't wish to speak of Lawrence . I wish to speak of you . I am told the world of art needs women of your kind . You have everything  --  wealth , influence , position . You hold patronage and opportunity in your hands . CAROLINE Interrupting . Why do n't you add : " You hold my husband too " ? In other words , that you regret your bargain ; and you want me to send him back to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make the price for your patronage so high , that a man must sacrifice his self-respect to gain the prize you offer . CAROLINE Quietly , after a look . I never dreamed that you 'd be jealous ; are you ? HILDEGARDE Fervently . Yes , I am jealous  --  jealous for him , but not of him ! CAROLINE I 've given him the opportunity . He has chosen . HILDEGARDE He has n't ! CAROLINE Then why are you so anxious ? HILDEGARDE Continuing . To choose , one must be independent . He is n't . He thinks he dare not choose against you . He fears to jeopardize commissions . There 's where you make unscrupulous use of your advantages ! p. 128 CAROLINE With a smile . My dear Mrs. Sanbury , I may be mistaken ; but you seem bent on telling me your husband does n't care for me . Is that what you mean ? HILDEGARDE No . Suddenly . What are you trying to make me think ? CAROLINE Think what you like . I make no disguises . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought you were n't a feminine woman . You 're interested in so many things beside your husband . I 've interested myself in him . If , in that interest , you think that he has gone beyond what you expected ; why not speak to him ? HILDEGARDE He 's lost his senses ! You 've blinded him ! CAROLINE I thought I had opened his eyes . You see , Love is n't blind . The trouble is , it sees too much ! Obliterating her with a glance . It sometimes sees things that are n't there at all . It is n't my fault if now he sees things as they are . I open everybody 's eyes . That 's my profession . Significantly . I 've opened yours , I hope . I 've opened Mr. Krellin 's . She laughs . HILDEGARDE Yes , and tried wantonly to destroy his faith in Emily , as now you 're trying to destroy my faith in Lawrence . p. 129 CAROLINE Ah , then you are afraid ! HILDEGARDE Uncertainly . Afraid of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course , you 'll struggle . HILDEGARDE I never struggle for what is mine . CAROLINE Hum . HILDEGARDE Nervously . I 'm not afraid of Lawrence . Your insinuations do n't affect me  --  you CAROLINE Indeed . Then why this argument ? HILDEGARDE Amazed . You 'd like to make me think my husband is your lover ! She draws a sharp breath . CAROLINE And if that were the case  --  What then ? Pause . HILDEGARDE Oh , no ! You would n't boast of it ! CAROLINE Quietly . I never boast . Only the insecure do that . HILDEGARDE It 's a lie ! It 's a lie ! ! It 's a lie ! ! ! CAROLINE Ask him . HILDEGARDE You mean you would have me ask my husband such a question ? p. 130 CAROLINE Why not ? HILDEGARDE Suddenly calm , and seeing through CAROLINE . Because it is n't important enough , Mrs. Knollys . CAROLINE You mean , your husband 's fidelity is n't important to you ? HILDEGARDE Oh , yes , but there 's far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped aside . I 've given you every chance with him ; because you may have helped him . I do n't know . You 've taken his time , his mind , his work , his energy . He has amused you , fed your vanity and gratified your sense of power over people . I 've been patient . I 've left him free to choose . For if a woman like you can take the rest of him from me ; he is n't worth my energy to keep . I do n't want even a part of him ; if anything is withheld  --  CAROLINE With an amused sneer . And what have I to do with your ideal of marriage ? HILDEGARDE I do n't approve of the way that you make use of the protection of your husband 's name ! CAROLINE Then you 'd better see my husband . She goes toward the hall door . HILDEGARDE Perhaps I shall . CAROLINE He 'll be delighted to discuss Miss Madden . Mr. Krellin also wants to speak with him . He 'll welcome you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just back from the South . He 'll be in splendid humor after all you 've done for him in shutting up the mills . Good-by . She exits in smiling good humor . HILDEGARDE stands by the table and slowly sinks into a chair . The hum of tenement life becomes audible . A baby is heard crying ; and every detail that can be developed , pointing to the barren squalor of her life is emphasized as in contrast with the elegance of MRS . KNOLLYS . HILDEGARDE sits lost in thought , while the hub-bub swings around her . Suddenly the telephone begins to ring . HILDEGARDE does n't notice it at first . The bell continues . HILDEGARDE seems to come to her senses with a start . She goes to the ' phone , takes receiver and listens mechanically . p. 131 HILDEGARDE Yes . This is Mrs. Sanbury . Who is this ? Oh , Miss Ambie . Yes . Mrs. Knollys has just left . Coldly . I quite understand . Yes . Good-bye . Suddenly . Wait ! Hello ! Quietly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the hall , and goes to clear up the table . Yes . I should like to speak with him . Pause . She speaks very tenderly . Is this you , Larrie ? I 'm sorry ; but it could n't be helped . She 's just left . Yes . Nothing has happened . I 'd just like to speak with you ; as soon as you can get here . Larrie ! What ? You ca n't ? Long breath . Then I 'll wait for you . This evening too ? Well , listen , Larrie , you must come . No . I ca n't speak of it over the ' phone . I must see you ; and as quickly as possible . But this is important too ! Pause . No ! I ca n't wait ! Do you understand , Larrie , I wo n't wait ! ! ! She claps up the receiver and crosses to her room exclaiming hysterically : " I wo n't wait ! ! I wo n't wait ! ! " MURTHA goes on quietly clearing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out drawers violently and pushing them back again . MURTHA shakes her head sorrowfully . She has cannily sensed the situation . HILDEGARDE re-enters , carrying a small satchel , which she places on a chair next to the table . During the following scene she packs it with a dressing gown , tooth brush , hair brush and comb , slippers , night gown , etc . Several times during the scene she exits rapidly to her room for these toilet articles , and returns , without interrupting the dialogue . p. 132 MURTHA As HILDEGARDE enters carrying her satchel . Ye ai n't goin ' away ; are ye ? HILDEGARDE Jamming things into the grip . Yes yes MURTHA Suddenly . Ah , where 's me head ! I saw th ' Doolans . They 've got a date wid you , they say . HILDEGARDE Going to her room . I do n't want to see them . MURTHA Calling after HILDEGARDE . Th ' agent says he 's goin ' to throw him out . HILDEGARDE He deserves it . MURTHA Ah , but jisht a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' th ' fambly . HILDEGARDE Entering and continuing her packing . I ca n't help them . MURTHA Doolan wanted to come here to apologoize ; but Oi told him he 'd bedther not . He 'd be met on th ' doorshtep wid a lump av his death ! HILDEGARDE You can tell them the ejection office will tend to them . She exits again and immediately re-appears . MURTHA Shure , it 's not you that 's talkin ' , dearie ; and Oi ca n't go down there ! Th ' avvicer would see me oye , and know th ' Doolans done it . Oh , where 's that shtuff ? They say it 's goin ' blue on me . An ' you would n't have thim turned out in th ' shtreet. p. 133 HILDEGARDE Pointing to the shelf above the sink . It 's over there . You 'd better take it with you . MURTHA Thank ye . Tenderly coaxing . Go on now , you . Go on now , shishter . Take him back and let him shtay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems queer that you MURTHA Shure ye ca n't be angry wid th ' min folks . They 're chilthren all av thim . Piling up dishes . Some gits crazy over the booze , and some gits crazy over polyteecks and some gits crazy over wimmin Picking up all the dishesand th ' resht gits crazy over nothin ' at all . Coaxingly . Go on now . Give iviry body anither chance . That 's what I allus says . Singing out . Ha ! Now there 's moy Tim  --  Ha ! Oi could ha ' left him any toime this forty years fer what he done to me  --  and what he did n't do . G'wan now , dearie , give th ' man anither chance . HILDEGARDE leaves the grip . Th ' Lord love ye , that 's roight and it 's th ' gran ' good heart ye have . HILDEGARDE goes toward door of her room . MURTHA continues with a wise and tender canniness . And ah ye 'll not be needin ' these things right away . She throws the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fer to-night . HILDEGARDE has exited sobbing brokenly . MURTHA returns to the work of clearing up the table . She shakes her head and exclaims : Shure , they 're chilthren ! Ivery blessed wan of thim  --  just chilthren . The CURTAIN descends on the Second Act. @x The scene is the same as Act II . It is about eight-thirty of the evening of the same day . The table has been cleared and everything is restored to order . The door of HILDEGARDE 'S room is open . There are no lights on the stage , but the scene is dimly lit by the glow of lights from the flats in the rear.After the rise of the curtain , KRELLIN enters from the hall door , and goes immediately to the telephone on the typewriting desk . KRELLIN With the ' phone . Hello  --  give me seven-one-one Plaza  --  yes , if you please . No , seven-one-one . Enter LAWRENCE from the hall , flinging the door back . KRELLIN Say , be quiet , will you ? LAWRENCE Nervously . Oh , that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a light over the table . KRELLIN Psch ! To ' phone . Hello , seven-one-one Plaza ? Yes . Mr. Krellin of the " NEW YORK ECHO " would like to speak with Mr. Knollys . LAWRENCE Startled . See here , Krellin , you 'd better drop it . KRELLIN To ' phone . Then I 'll ring up again  --  yes , later . As soon as LAWRENCE has gathered that HUBERT is out , he makes a gesture of relief and flings into HILDEGARDE 'S room . He finds her bag and immediately reenters carrying it . KRELLIN , in the interim , has hung up the receiver . p. 136 LAWRENCE What does this mean ? Where is she ? He drops the bag and goes uncertainly toward his room at the left , and opens the door . KRELLIN Have you been drinking ? LAWRENCE Fiercely . That 's my business ! KRELLIN H 'm ! Have you any other ? LAWRENCE Coming towards him . I want to know where my wife is ; and I want to know why you 're telephoning my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat my Emmy the way you let them treat your wife . LAWRENCE Do n't you interfere between Hildegarde and me ! Because , if you do , by God , I 'll  --  KRELLIN I do n't mix in with you . I have my own score to settle with Mr. Knollys and his wife . LAWRENCE Seriously . Krellin , I advise you to leave Mr. Knollys out of it . KRELLIN Ah , you are afraid , eh ? LAWRENCE It is n't me  --  it 's  --  He hesitates . KRELLIN Violently . So ! You too ! ! That woman has made you believe that Emmy  --  He goes toward LAWRENCE angrily , but stops and laughs . I do n't wonder Mrs. Knollys thinks all women are like she is ! p. 137 LAWRENCE Violently . You  --  ? KRELLIN Quietly . All the more am I determined now . LAWRENCE At his wits ' end . There 'll be an awful mix-up ! I do n't know what to do ! Sits down blankly . KRELLIN Do n't think that I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't business  --  it is n't Emmy  --  it 's you . Scathingly . I am ashamed of you ! You 'd let this lie rest on my Emmy 's shoulders , rather than have the truth revealed about yourself . Of course you do n't want the truth to come out . But you see , I 'm different . I do n't fear the truth . And if your conduct with Mrs. Knollys can not stand her husband 's or your wife 's investigation , I am sorry . That is all . LAWRENCE Get that idea out of your head ! I do n't fear the truth . It 's Hildegarde I 'm thinking of , and only Hildegarde . KRELLIN Scornfully . You 've thought so much of her these last four months , since  --  LAWRENCE I have . We 're down to rock-bottom , Krellin . We 're full of debts  --  even my life-insurance is gone . I 've given up my job . We 've pawned everything that we could raise a cent on ; and Hildegarde 's stood by me . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , by dragging Mr. Knollys in . KRELLIN laughs scornfully . I know it looks as if I had neglected Hildegarde ; but she understands . I 've had to hold on to this one chance , tooth and toe-nail . Desperately . I wo n't let anything interfere with it ! Not you , nor Hildegarde  --  nor Emily  --  nor  --  p. 138 KRELLIN Interrupting . Is that so ! Well , no matter what it costs to you or anybody else , we make Mrs. Knollys eat those lying words she said about my Emmy . So . KRELLIN exits through the hall door . LAWRENCE stands perplexed for a moment , then goes decidedly to the ' phone and rings up . LAWRENCE Hello  --  give me one-four-three-three Plaza  --  yes  --  in a hurry , please . Pause . Central , they must answer . It 's a private wire and they are expecting me to ring them up . Pause . Then with an exaggerated change to a very polite manner . Oh , hello  --  Is that you , Caroline ? I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm so sorry , but I sha n't be able to get back  --  Nothing 's happened to my voice ; but  --  ah  --  the fact is I 've had an accident only my ankle  --  Oh , nothing serious  --  I 'm sure , so do n't be alarmed . Yes , getting out of the cab . I 'm telephoning from a drug store . Yes , it is painful ; but I 'm sure it 's only wrenched . Yes , I 'll ring up my doctor as soon as I get home . I shall be quite alone . Please do n't worry . Oh , I can tend to everything . Pause . I 've already telephoned to Mrs. Millette . Mercy , no , I would n't have a nurse touch me . Yes , I 'll telephone in the morning yes , then as soon as he has left , I 'll ring you up and tell you what his diagnosis is . Hildegarde ? No , I have n't seen her . Oh , not because of anything that happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend the week-end with some friends  --  yes  --  somewhere in the country  --  Westchester . No , I sha n't send for her . Yes , if there 's anything  --  but  --  Oh , thank you so much . Good-by . He rings off . During the last part of the above speech , HILDEGARDE has quietly entered from the hall door . p. 139 LAWRENCE Relieved and confused . Oh  --  Westchester !  --  I mean , I 've just been telephoning . HILDEGARDE I did n't expect to see you this evening . She goes to her typewriting desk for some letters , etc . LAWRENCE Well , there was something in the sound of your voice over the ' phone that made me nervous ; and I lied out of my engagements . As usual , said the first foolish thing that came into my mind . Now I 'll have to stick to it , I suppose . HILDEGARDE Why do you always lie these days ? LAWRENCE I never Be to you . HILDEGARDE Is that really the truth ? LAWRENCE Why , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? LAWRENCE I did n't know where you 'd gone to , and  --  HILDEGARDE Did n't you say I 'd gone to Westchester because you were afraid that Mrs. Knollys would be jealous of your spending an evening alone with me ? LAWRENCE What have you got in your head ? She looks at him . He continues . I had to say something to get out of things . Then I come home and find your bag packed . Where are you going ? p. 140 HILDEGARDE I think it best I go away a little while . LAWRENCE Away ? Where to ? HILDEGARDE I have n't decided . I was going to leave a note for you ; but Michael told me you were here ; so I  --  LAWRENCE Bursting . Michael ! Do you know what he 's doing ? And just now , of all times ! When everything depends on Mr. Knollys ? HILDEGARDE Yes , I advised him . LAWRENCE What ! Pause . Hildegarde , suppose what Mrs. Knollys said about Emily is true ? HILDEGARDE Turning sharply . Larrie ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HILDEGARDE It 's not . And even if it were , she 's not the one to make the accusation . LAWRENCE Why not ? Pause . What 's in your mind ? Krellin 's been saying things ! HILDEGARDE Oh , no . LAWRENCE I know it . Why , just a moment ago he said that I was afraid to meet Mr. Knollys . HILDEGARDE Afraid ? Why ? p. 141 LAWRENCE He thinks that I  --  He hesitates . HILDEGARDE In a level tone . What  --  ? LAWRENCE That I 've forgotten you . Recklessly . Oh , I do n't care what he thinks , except that I do n't want you to get wrong-headed . I thought at least , you 'd understand . There 's not a thing I 've done that anybody ca n't question . HILDEGARDE That 's ambiguous , Larrie ; but I sha n't question you . LAWRENCE I mean that anybody ca n't investigate . I 've never really lied to you ; have I ? HILDEGARDE No  --  not lied exactly  --  just disguised things to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my clothes , my work , our home , our life together , your work and all the circumstances and people that have come between us . LAWRENCE Oh , those things ! I do n't mean them . HILDEGARDE What do you mean ? LAWRENCE Blurting it out . I mean Car  --  Mrs. Knollys . That 's what you mean ; and that 's what Krellin means . HILDEGARDE Tremulously . Yes . She turns away. p. 142 LAWRENCE I want to explain everything , right from the beginning  --  everything . She moves away . He follows . I want you to know the whole truth , and nothing but the truth ; and then you can judge for yourself . Oh , I 'm not proud of what I 've had to do ; but there is n't a single thing that you ca n't know about  --  or that I 'm really ashamed of  --  I swear ! There is a knock at the hall door . LAWRENCE , after a gesture of impatience , continues : If that 's Krellin , tell him I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone . He 's got to leave Mr. Knollys out of this . I do n't want Knollys to get wrong-headed too ! He has followed HILDEGARDE who has moved up to the door . HILDEGARDE At door , to LAWRENCE . Please ! She opens the door and discovers HUBERT KNOLLYS standing there . HUBERT To HILDEGARDE . I could n't find the bell . LAWRENCE Retreating . Oh , Lord ! HUBERT Mrs. Sanbury , I 'm very glad to see you . Extends his hand . She takes it . HILDEGARDE I 've been hoping you 'd come . LAWRENCE is surprised . p. 143 HUBERT Thank you . LAWRENCE Yes  --  we  --  HUBERT Laconically to LAWRENCE . Oh  --  how are you ? LAWRENCE Embarrassed . Oh , finely been pretty busy since you left ; but  --  HUBERT Abruptly . Yes , so I hear . He turns to HILDEGARDE and points to a chair . May I ? HILDEGARDE Nodding . Let me take your things . LAWRENCE takes his hat and coat . HUBERT Sitting and speaking to HILDEGARDE . I 've just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we heard you were away . HUBERT Turning quietly . I was rather of the opinion that you knew I was away . LAWRENCE Yes , to be sure  --  of course . Did you have a successful trip of it ? HUBERT Ironically . Have you had time to read the papers ? p. 144 LAWRENCE I was interested and all that ; though I have n't followed the strike very closely . A little out of my line , you know . So if you 're going to talk economics , had n't I better  --  ? He starts toward his room . HUBERT Interrupting . There are some things I wish to discuss with your wife . I 'd rather you 'd be here . That is , if you do n't mind . LAWRENCE Vaguely . By all means  --  not at all . HILDEGARDE turns anxiously to HUBERT . HUBERT To HILDEGARDE . You know , it was due a little to your suggestion , I went South . HILDEGARDE And ? HUBERT We 've increased the operative 's salaries and killed the child labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HUBERT Grimly . I could n't have done it by myself . You opened fire on my competitors . That made it easy . It looked like a general lock-out ; so I called a committee of the managers , and we all agreed to meet the strikers ' terms . Alone , I would have made a Quixotic failure . Well , we 've yielded . You 've kept your word ; I 've kept mine . Now we 'll see what the workers will do with more money and shorter hours . Personally , I think they 'll invest in more phonographs and liquor ; and their children will continue to go barefoot . p. 145 HILDEGARDE Perhaps . But the use of time and money must be learned . HUBERT They 'll have their chance . Now , for the matter that brings me here immediately . He takes out a letter . I received this by messenger this afternoon  --  from Miss Madden . HILDEGARDE Yes . HUBERT Miss Madden urges me to see you . HILDEGARDE She told me . HUBERT So I am here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HILDEGARDE There 's only one possible reparation . Your wife must withdraw her statement absolutely . The circumstances are such that  --  HUBERT I know . HILDEGARDE What can have been her motive ? HUBERT There is no question of Miss Madden 's innocence . She suffers from two misfortunes . Firstly , she is a very dear friend of mine ; and secondly , she was of service to my wife . Gratitude makes some natures resentful . I , however , feel a great obligation to Miss Madden for averting a scandal , that my wife 's ignorance of the law nearly precipitated . HILDEGARDE Mr. Krellin helped her hush the matter up . But now , unless your wife withdraws her statements , he is determined to publish everything . p. 146 HUBERT So his telegram informed me . But-Mr . Krellin 's threat could have very little weight either with Mrs. Knollys or with me . HILDEGARDE Why ? HUBERT You must surely see that after doing all he could to keep the matter from the press , it would be ridiculous for Krellin now to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation . Pause . Will not my personal apology for Mrs. Knollys to Mr. Krellin and Miss Madden suffice ? HILDEGARDE Considering the accusation and the way you are involved , I should say not . HUBERT Perhaps you 're right . Rises . I suggested it merely to show you how really powerless we are . A money damage for defamation is out of the question  --  HILDEGARDE Quite . HUBERT Then what do you propose ? HILDEGARDE Firmly . That right here , and before the very people in whose presence Mrs. Knollys made the accusation , she must retract and with full apologies . Nothing less . HUBERT Involuntarily . I 'd love to see it ! LAWRENCE Hildegarde ! p. 147 HUBERT To HILDEGARDE . Your husband 's exclamation proves that he and I know my wife much better than you do , Mrs. Sanbury . He appreciates her force of will . To LAWRENCE . Do n't you , sir ? LAWRENCE looks on guard and says nothing . HILDEGARDE Is your wife absolutely indifferent to the social consequences of her own conduct ? HUBERT Sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately after having accused Emily , she did her best to make me believe my husband had become her lover . HUBERT Attempting to be surprised . What ! ! LAWRENCE Bounding out of his skin . Hildegarde ! ! To HUBERT . This is outrageous ! HILDEGARDE Yes . LAWRENCE is open mouthed . HUBERT To HILDEGARDE . Are you sure you 're not mistaken ? HILDEGARDE Oh , no . On the contrary , she took the greatest pains to impress it on me with all the malicious insolence of triumph she could command . p. 148 HUBERT But  --  why do you tell me this ? HILDEGARDE To ask you to use it as you think best , to help me to force your wife to make just reparation to my friend . LAWRENCE Finding his voice . It 's all a damnable lie ! A whole-sale rotten  --  ! HUBERT Interrupting . Pardon , I should reserve such language until you have a better right to use it . LAWRENCE Wh-what do you mean ? HUBERT Remember , sir , the lady you are speaking of is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help that ! I have my wife to consider , Mr. Knollys , and  --  HUBERT Scornfully . Indeed ! LAWRENCE Continuing . And with all deference to your wife , I must repeat that if your wife said those things to my wife , your wife uttered a lie ! ! HILDEGARDE So I told her myself . HUBERT Promptly . You did that to shield your husband . p. 149 LAWRENCE Vehemently . And I protest that if your wife  --  HUBERT Sternly to LAWRENCE . Keep quiet ! LAWRENCE Spinning about . For God 's sake , some one do me the favor to tell me that one of us is blind or deaf or  --  HUBERT Severely . Sit down ! ! LAWRENCE Landing into a chair and wailing . She 's old enough to be my mother ! HUBERT To HILDEGARDE . Did she say anything further ? Come ! HILDEGARDE She wantonly taunted me with my failure to hold my husband . When I told her I did not believe her , she even urged me to question him . I refused . Please to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , why did n't you ? HUBERT To HILDEGARDE . Why did you not question him ? HILDEGARDE Because  --  simply because I did not believe your wife . LAWRENCE Fervently . Thank God ! p. 150 HUBERT But if you do not believe her statements , why repeat them to me ? HILDEGARDE To serve my friend , I shall deliberately choose to believe your wife ; and if you will help me  --  HUBERT Interjecting . Rely on that . HILDEGARDE Then I shall act as if everything she said were absolutely true . LAWRENCE Oh , Hildegarde ! How can you ! ? HILDEGARDE To HUBERT . In that way we can turn her arrow against Emily into a boomerang to recoil upon herself . HUBERT Hum . Then you will name her as a co-respondent ? HILDEGARDE Genuinely frightened . What ! You mean divorce my  --  divorce Larrie ? HUBERT Yes . LAWRENCE To HILDEGARDE . See here ! I 'm the one that your damned boomerang is hitting ! HUBERT To HILDEGARDE . This is unavoidable . LAWRENCE See here !  --  HILDEGARDE Expostulatingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not believe her . She did it to provoke a jealous quarrel ; and if I judge her rightly , she will withdraw her insults rather than endure disgrace . It wo n't have to go that far ! D-Do n't you see that ? p. 151 HUBERT Thank you for your assurance , but I must differ with you . LAWRENCE To HUBERT . Why ?  --  do you think that I  --  ? HUBERT Calmly . I think there is an important person that you both have so far overlooked  --  myself . To LAWRENCE . You have chosen to protect my wife by calling her a liar . To HILDEGARDE . You protect your husband by calling her a liar , too . It seems my attitude has been neglected . HILDEGARDE is appalled . LAWRENCE Bravely . Well  --  ? HUBERT Yes . Here 's where you come in . LAWRENCE Crumbling . What do you intend to do ? HUBERT I choose to believe these statements for my own sake . HILDEGARDE You ca n't ! You ca n't ! ! LAWRENCE To HUBERT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wildly . He believes it ! He believes it ! HUBERT Quietly . I always believe my wife when she affirms , never when she denies . p. 152 HILDEGARDE Stupefied . But , Mr. Knollys , you do n't really think that HUBERT Interrupting . My dear lady , you are too gullible . To LAWRENCE . Now , I want the truth , and I expect it manfully . He approaches LAWRENCE who retreats . LAWRENCE This is perfectly ridiculous ! HUBERT Taking out a note-book . Please have the courtesy to remember that it is you who has made us both ridiculous ; and do n't thrust it down our throats . Consulting his book . You spent at least a week with Caroline alone in Italy . LAWRENCE That is n't true ! Susan Ambie HUBERT Promptly . I have seen Miss Ambie . She did more than confess . She attempted to defend it . LAWRENCE Miss Ambie is a fool ! HUBERT Quite so . Continuing . Do you admit being alone with Mrs. Knollys ? LAWRENCE Pausing . Why  --  I  --  HILDEGARDE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 153 HUBERT To HILDEGARDE . I heard you say some weeks ago you had letters to that effect . LAWRENCE Imploringly . Hildegarde ! HILDEGARDE Yes . I have them . HUBERT Very good . I trust you to produce them at the proper time . To LAWRENCE . You crossed on the same steamer . LAWRENCE Grasping at a straw . Miss Ambie was with us ! HUBERT Yes ; and since your arrival on October 5th you have devoted all your time , practically day and night , to each other . LAWRENCE Angrily . I wo n't stand here and have you say such things about your wife ! HUBERT Am I to be the only one who does not say them ? LAWRENCE She simply  --  HUBERT With feigned anger . Pray do not explain my wife to me . Continuing from his note-book . On October 7th you actually installed yourself under my roof  --  a most tasteless procedure , which I refused to countenance . I went South . You thought , no doubt , that openness would disarm suspicion . It does n't work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openly confesses her infatuation to your wife , boasts of her power , and then further openly denounces an innocent woman , in order to produce the impression that her own actions are not subject to criticism . Truly , this is the very blindness of infatuation . Laughs . I admire your brass  --  but really it wo n't do . The rest of us are not so blind . I compliment you on your conquest Ironically . But how long did you imagine I would allow this to continue ? p. 154 LAWRENCE Mr. Knollys , all that I can say is  --  HUBERT Scathingly . At least , sir , have the courage of your actions . Snapping his book closed , and looking at HILDEGARDE , who sees she has awakened a Frankenstein . I have a further list of rendezvous , which I shall not ask you to verify in the presence of your wife ! LAWRENCE My wife knows everything that can be said about me ! HUBERT I doubt it . In any case , your protection until now has been your wife 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LAWRENCE Interrupting . All right . Get your lawyer . Now I 'll thank you , Mr. Knollys , to leave me alone with my wife , who 's never doubted me , and has no reason to doubt me now . I have the courage of my actions ! I 'll bring the whole thing right into the open  --  and if you can stand it , I can . The two men look each other squarely in the eye . Suddenly the bell rings over the hall door . HUBERT Turning to HILDEGARDE . Is that your bell ? HILDEGARDE goes directly to the hall door , opens it and discloses MRS . KNOLLYS . She is magnificently dressed in a long opera cloak over her evening gown . She has also a hevy veil about her head . CAROLINE enters swiftly , then stands appalled . p. 155 HUBERT Recognizing her . Ah , Caroline ! Surprise of all . CAROLINE undoes her veil and faces him . You come most apropos . Sarcastically . Did you call to see Mrs. Sanbury ? CAROLINE After a pause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . HUBERT Indeed ! How is that ? CAROLINE I am on my way to the opera . I assumed that Miss Madden had summoned you . I thought I 'd pick you up . HUBERT How kind of you . But may I ask why you assumed that I 'd be here in Mrs. Sanbury 's apartment ? CAROLINE Quite naturally . Mrs. Sanbury is the only other person interested with you , in deceiving Mr. Krellin and whitewashing Miss Madden . HILDEGARDE Mrs. Knollys , my husband telephoned you that I had gone to Westchester ; so you could n't have expected to see me . LAWRENCE is desperate . HUBERT To CAROLINE . Oh , you expected to find Mr. Sanbury alone . After a glance at LAWRENCE , he turns to HILDEGARDE . Well , then , Mrs. Sanbury , let us no longer intrude . Will you direct me to Miss Madden ? p. 156 HILDEGARDE Moves to the hall door , then turns . Mrs. Knollys , I think it only fair to tell you , that I have repeated to Mr. Knollys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HUBERT opens the door . HILDEGARDE exits ; and he follows , closing the door behind him . LAWRENCE is standing stupefied down left . CAROLINE is at center . Pause . CAROLINE In an unsteady voice . I think I 'm going to faint . LAWRENCE Putting her into chair at the table , anxiously . Oh , do n't ! For Heaven 's sake , do n't do that . She sits . I 'll get you a glass of water . He goes quickly to the tubs and pours one out of a bottle . Coming to her . Here , drink this . Is there anything else I can get you ? She sips the water . Sha n't I send for some one ? CAROLINE Ironically . For whom ? She drinke the water . LAWRENCE You feel better now , do n't you ? Shall I get you some salts ? He moves quickly toward HILDEGARDE 'S room . CAROLINE No . I 'll be all right . Suddenly . You walk very well . p. 157 LAWRENCE Stopping . Why , yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No . I have no trouble with my ankle . LAWRENCE Suddenly remembering . Oh , forgive me , Caroline . CAROLINE In a rage . Do n't call me Caroline ! I imagined you here alone , in pain , too ill to telephone  --  I thought you might be glad to see me . I lost my prudence . LAWRENCE turns away . How much of what you 've said to me for all these months is true ? What did you mean by taking me into your arms to-day and Agh  --  ! ! She turns from him . LAWRENCE Simply . I 've done a great wrong . CAROLINE Sarcastically . And when did you discover that ? LAWRENCE After I kissed you to-day-the way I did . CAROLINE That 's why you left so suddenly . LAWRENCE Yes . CAROLINE And came right back to her ? LAWRENCE I tried to find her , but I could n't . I was frantic . I looked every place . I really thought that she had left me . In a low voice . And I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and she came in. p. 158 CAROLINE The kiss that woke your prudence put mine to sleep . How strange ! And you were thinking all the time of her ! She laughs hysterically- LAWRENCE Why , yes . Always ! My work , my ambition ,  --  even my gratitude to you has been for her sake . CAROLINE Then I was merely the ladder on which you proposed to climb and pluck the golden fruit for her ! LAWRENCE I 've been a miserable cad ! I know what you must think of me ! CAROLINE And what do they think of you ? LAWRENCE Oh , how can I tell you ? Your husband insists upon putting the worst interpretation upon everything ! CAROLINE You mean ? LAWRENCE I did all I could to make him see that he was wrong in doubting you . A withering look from CAROLINE . Oh , but what made you tell those outrageous falsehoods about us to Hildegarde ! ? CAROLINE Rising in a cold rage . The word falsehood can only be applied to your attitude to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above and to be free from the commonness and squalor of your surroundings , and I was willing to help you . But I find you only a little entrepreneur , afriad of your conscience , and satisfied with your mutton ! Well , return to it ! She moves away , then turns . I have one more direction to give you . Kindly refrain from any further defense of me . I wish to speak to my husband . Will you tell him I am waiting ? LAWRENCE exits through the hall door . CAROLINE pauses in intense thought , then gathers herself together , takes her vanitybox from her opera bag , opens the mirror and scrutinizes herself closely . She adjusts her hair , smooths her eyebrows and puts a little rouge on her lips . She regains her absolute composure by a supreme effort . HUBERT enters . He is very self-possessed . p. 159 HUBERT You wished to see me ? CAROLINE Charmingly . I have been waiting . HUBERT For what ? CAROLINE If you 've quite finished your visit , I thought perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives him her cloak . HUBERT Taking the cloak . No , thank you . CAROLINE You wish to go right home ? HUBERT For the present I have decided to  --  ah  --  live at the club . CAROLINE Very well . Can I drop you there ? HUBERT No . Putting her cloak on a chair . I shall need you here . CAROLINE Oh , then our meeting was most fortunate . HUBERT Yes . I was wondering how to get you here . CAROLINE As it is probably the last time I shall ever come , if there 's anything that you would like me to do for you while I am  --  HUBERT Interrupting her , admiringly . Caroline , you 're magnificent ! We 'd better get right to the point . Looking at his watch . I need n't detain you very long . I 've told Miss Madden and the others to  --  ah  --  come down-stairs in five minutes . p. 160 CAROLINE Acting as if perplexed . I wonder what she can have to say to me ; or Incredulouslydo you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid I shall be obliged to insist upon it . I have already satisfied Mr. Krellin . CAROLINE Dear , dear ! That must have been fatiguing ; but how very nice ! I believe he wants to marry her . HUBERT Yes . CAROLINE A very amusing man . Too bad ! But how am I concerned ? HUBERT In the presence of all the people before whom you made your accusation against Miss Madden , I should like you to retract it and apologizc . CAROLINE Very graciously . My dear Hubert , I consider that you 've never had any fault to find with me in any of your former affectionate waywardnesses . Of course , I have regretted them , but my pride has never been involved till now . This adventure is different . You might at least have chosen a woman of your class . I closed my eyes even to this , until the unfortunate woman was forced upon me in a manner I felt obliged to resent . I 'm very sorry . I know so little of how these people act . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wish me to apologize to her for having said the truth . She laughs . Really , Hubert , do n't you think you ask too much ? p. 161 HUBERT I have assured them you would do so . That was the purpose of my visit . CAROLINE Still smiling . I 'm very sorry to disappoint the audience and perplex the impresario . Distinctly . You may cut my salary if you like , but I give no performance this evening . Rises . HUBERT Gracefully . Having heard you once , the audience refuses a substitute . CAROLINE Then I suggest you reimburse them . HUBERT No , that wo n't do . CAROLINE Have you tried ? HUBERT I explained that you came here with the best intentions , and that you would fulfil their expectations . CAROLINE Merrily . I could n't keep my face straight in the tragic parts . HUBERT I must really insist that you be serious . CAROLINE It 's no use my trying . HUBERT Looking at his watch . We 're wasting time . CAROLINE Hubert , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're in earnest . p. 162 HUBERT I am . CAROLINE And if I still refuse ? HUBERT Then you force me to resort to measures that we both decided were ridiculous . I have waited for this moment for twenty-five long years . For all that time you 've held the whip ; I 've had to canter to your wish . But now , my dear , if you do not retract your statement and protect Miss Madden absolutely , I shall sue for a divorce and name your  --  latest as a co-respondent . CAROLINE Calmly . You ca n't . HUBERT I have persuaded Mrs. Sanbury to allow me to assume the suit . CAROLINE Slowly . So , you stand with her . HUBERT Precisely . CAROLINE I compliment you on your associate . HUBERT You left me no choice . CAROLINE Well ? HUBERT It 's been your policy to overlook my tres-passes ; but note I have not condoned either in private or in public . That is why I do not wish to appear with you in our box to-night  --  that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I discovered the  --  intrigue ; and I shall not return . Whatever was lacking in my evidence , Mrs. Sanbury and others have supplied . p. 163 CAROLINE Go on . HUBERT I should like to settle matters amicably , but really , my dear , it 's no longer in my power . If I do not sue for the divorce , Mrs. Sanbury will ; and she will name you as a co-respondent . That might be more annoying . CAROLINE I have done nothing ! HUBERT You have always told me that our society deals in appearances ; and you have done sufficient here and abroad to create a prima facie case . The burden will rest upon you to prove that we are wrong . CAROLINE Snapping her fingers . That for your appearances ! HUBERT They are far more damning than any you may know about me and Miss Madden . Come , you 're too much a thoroughbred and too wise a woman not to know when you are beaten . CAROLINE Leaning forward . Let me understand you . If I give Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit . That is your price , is it ? HUBERT As far as I 'm concerned , yes . I can make no bargain for Mrs. Sanbury . CAROLINE Then what 's the use of my withdrawing anything , if she  --  ? HUBERT You will have me with you instead of against you . p. 164 CAROLINE And what of that ? HUBERT If I stand by and make no objection to Sanbury 's attentions , who else can ? They become immediately innocent , and her proceeding is discouraged ; but if I join with her  --  which I mean to do unless you meet my terms , you become immediately defenseless and every suspicion is justified . A movement from CAROLINE . Without me , to whom can you appeal for help ? To Society ? It would rend you and rejoice in it , as you have rended others . You can ill afford to have your name publicly coupled with this young Sanbury 's in any dirty proceeding . CAROLINE Sharply driving a bargain . In other words , if I protect Miss Madden from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HUBERT Precisely ; and we all enter into our usual , polite conspiracy of silence . I advise you to reflect . CAROLINE Rising . I shall . I 'll think it over . She sits in the chair down left . HUBERT With his watch . You 've just two minutes to decide . CAROLINE Ominously . Hubert , I advise you not to humiliate me before these people . p. 165 HUBERT It 's either these few people here , or the grinning congregation you will be forced to face alone , in your temple of Convention . Pause . I know what this must mean to you . CAROLINE shudders . You 've been hard hit to-day . He goes toward her . With all your bravado , I know you 're covering a wound . I believe that you seriously cared about this young man . For the first time in your life you 've cared about anything outside of yourself . That 's why you forgot yourself and went so wrong . She looks up at him . Oh ! There 's hope in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You made yourself vulnerable for him , and the disillusionment has come , and hurt you far more than you will ever confess . He turns away . And then I 'd like to spare you for another reason . After all , you are the mother of my child , and we 've negotiated something of a life since we were young together . Pause . CAROLINE Rising . Send them in ! He goes to the hall door , opens it and makes a gesture to them outside . HUBERT To CAROLINE . They 're coming now . CAROLINE A malicious expression crosses her face . It passes . She turns and asks : Do you want to stay and see me take my medicine ? p. 166 HUBERT Bowing . I know that you will do it gracefully . LAWRENCE enters from the hall . CAROLINE turns immediately toward the audience . LAWRENCE is very uncomfortable as he passes HUBERT . LAWRENCE is followed by KRELLIN and EMILY . KRELLIN-is uneasily defiant . EMILY looks down . HILDEGARDE is the last to enter . She looks uncertainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely self-possessed . HILDEGARDE closes the door . The others have gathered awkwardly around the table , center . CAROLINE stands in her position down left . There is an awkward pause . HUBERT turns to CAROLINE , who shrugs her shoulders gaily and turns away . HUBERT To all . Hum  --  As I explained to you , my wife so much regretted her unfortunate mistake that she was unwilling to allow the night to pass before she came down personally to rectify it . To KRELLIN and EMILY . You have assured me that her personal retraction will be satisfactory . My wife desires to make it . KRELLIN . Taking out a paper . Mr. Knollys , I have drawn up a paper for your wife to sing . HUBERT But  --  CAROLINE Hubert ! She passes him and goes to the table , center , p. 167 KRELLIN I think that she will find it accurate . KRELLIN puts the paper on the table , center , and takes out his fountain pen , which he lays carefully next to it . CAROLINE sits at the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November twenty-ninth , nineteen-fifteen . I , Mrs. Hubert Knollys , having permitted myself to make a certain disparaging , slanderous and criminal statement HUBERT would interfere . She continueson this date , concerning the chastity of Miss Emily Madden ,  --  in the presence of Mr. Krellin . Mrs. Sanbury and Mr. Sanbury , do herewith with to recant it absolutely , and to state over my signature that my statement was groundless . To wit : husband , Mr. Hubert Knollys , I now declare this statement to be absolutely false , mistaken and unwarranted . Signed "  --  She looks up questioningly . KRELLIN points to the bottom of the page . Here ? KRELLIN Please . CAROLINE While writing . In addition , I wish to make my humble apology for any misinterpretation I may have made in regard to Miss Madden 's generous services to my husband and to me . At least I 've learned that lies are futile , and that truth crushed to earth will rise again . She rises . EMILY sinks down into a chair at the right . The rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the signed retraction , leans toward KRELLIN and asks gently : p. 168 CAROLINE Is there anything else ? Pause . LAWRENCE Coming forward . Mrs. Knollys CAROLINE passes him , disdaining to reply . He then turns to MR . KNOLLYS . Considering the circumstances , I think it better that I resign the contract for remodeling your house . HUBERT Very well . Then  --  ah Caroline , if you 've quite finished that is CAROLINE Taking her cloak , which he holds for her . Yes . I told Morgan to wait . With a little shiver . I 'm afraid it 's raining . Hubert , will you please see if the motor is at the door ? HUBERT gives her a swift , suspicious look . She meets his returning glance with an assuring smile . Pause . HUBERT Yes , certainly . He quickly takes his hat and coat from the hatrack at the door , then turns . Good night . Good night . KRELLIN Picking up the signed paper . Good night . HUBERT exits . CAROLINE sweeps around as if to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EMILY , who is still seated at the right , with bowed head . CAROLINE 'S soft laugh is interrupted by KRELLIN , who speaks just as she has got to the door . p. 169 KRELLIN Mrs. Knollys She turns in the door , with her hand on the knob . You have signed this paper . Triumphantly . But I wish you to know that , for me , this was not in the least necessary . I had no belief whatever in your assertions . It was only because they distressed Miss Madden that I exacted this satisfaction . CAROLINE Graciously . Quite so Quite so . It 's a pity that I can not go further and silence all rumors about a little trip on the Chesapeake , Miss Madden made with Mr. Knollys on his yacht Looking at EMILY . Or any malicious inuendoes about my husband't too frequent visits at odd hours to her apartment in East Thirtieth Street . A movement from KRELLIN . Do n't be alarmed ! When rumors of this kind come to you , I want you to feel sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discredit them . EMILY has cowered under CAROLINE 'S speech . KRELLIN starts for the door with an inarticulate cry of rage and surprise . CAROLINE Very graciously . Good night . She closes the door behind her . KRELLIN Stop ! Wait ! ! EMILY has quickly risen , and intercepts him . p. 170 MADDEN Michael ! Please ! KRELLIN But Emmy , this is worse ! ! MADDEN You can do nothing more ! KRELLIN This time I 'll ! MADDEN No , no ! I 'm done for ! I 've got to give you up ! What she said is true ! ! KRELLIN What ! ? HILDEGARDE Oh ! MADDEN I could n't have stood it any longer ! I 'm glad the truth is out ! ! I 'm glad KRELLIN makes over to her , takes her by the shoulders and peers into her face . She sinks under his gaze . He recoils with an almost savage exclamation . HILDEGARDE Stop , Michael ! KRELLIN Tearing up the retraction . Women ! Women ! Then , with a bitter cry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and then it makes a fool of you a fool ! MADDEN No , Michael , I 'm the fool ! I should have trusted you I should have told you everything . You would have understood , But how can you forgive me for the lie I 've acted ! She goes toward him . But do n't do n't lose your faith in other women , because I 've been a fool She turns sobbing toward the door . Yes , I 'm the fool I 'm the fool She exits . p. 171 HILDEGARDE Michael , go with Emily . KRELLIN With infinite pity . So , my poor little Emmy . Oh , was primitive males ! We create idols , and when the truth come , what do we find ? Only pitiful humanity ! He goes to the door and turns with a wry smile . But you see , all of us together , fighting blindly , were not strong enough to fight ' against the truth ! He suddenly breaks out into an hysterical laugh . God is a great humorist ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As soon as the door closes on KRELLIN , HILDEGARDE also breaks out into a bitter laugh of disillusionment . LAWRENCE Frightened at her laughter . How can you laugh ? HILDEGARDE Because I too have been a fool ! And when one 's faith is dead , one needs a sense of humor . Grimly . So , she spoke the truth , your friend Mrs. Knollys  --  the truth about you as well . LAWRENCE Hildegarde , if she told you that I had ever been unfaithful to you , she lied . HILDEGARDE Did she lie when she said your nature could n't stand poverty  --  that you could n't work in this environment ,  --  that you had to court the rich to get your change to rise ,  --  that I , with my principles and my work stood in your way ? Did she lie about your character ? Oh , no , she showed me the truth . p. 172 LAWRENCE Hildegarde , you frighten me ! How can we live together if you believe such things ? HILDEGARDE Do think that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we ca n't live together ? LAWRENCE Terrified . Hildegarde ! HILDEGARDE I see it now . It 's been a hung mistake , our marrying . I 've got to leave you . LAWRENCE Wny  --  why ? HILDEGARDE You ca n't live my way any more . You 've got another call . I wo n't live your way . I try not to judge ; but I ca n't approve of what you do . LAWRENCE Then you really believe all that she said about me ! HILDEGARDE How little you understand ! LAWRENCE But she lied  --  she lied ! ! HILDEGARDE I know she 's neither big enough nor small enough to really give herself ; but there 's much more at stake than physical fidelity . She 's seduced you away from your self ,  --  from every ideal I built my faith in ,  --  from everything that consecrated us . LAWRENCE But you 're my wife ; are n't you ? HILDEGARDE You 're not the man I married ; and this is n't the kind of life together that we contemplated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; do n't you ? HILDEGARDE How far off that sounds ! LAWRENCE Imploringly . What are you saying ! ? HILDEGARDE Larrie , you 've become a stranger . Something in me has withered . I believe it 's dead . LAWRENCE NO  --  no ,  --  will you listen ? HILDEGARDE Oh , do n't explain . I 've had my fill of that . I 'm not blaming you . LAWRENCE Choking . Listen ! HILDEGARDE You 'll only end by asking for something that I can not give . I ca n't help it , Larrie ; but the truth is , we do n't need or want each other any longer . LAWRENCE But I want you ! I ca n't live without you . I 'd give up everything I ever hoped to get , to have you happy as you were ! HILDEGARDE We never used to think about happiness . It just came . LAWRENCE With a cry . I wish I 'd never met her ! LAWRENCE With a cry . I wih I 'd never met her ! It 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been . She 's taught us both a great deal . LAWRENCE What 's the good of that , if I 've lost you ? HILDEGARDE Continuing . And then I like to think the factory people are a little happier for our knowing Mr. Knollys . LAWRENCE Reproachfully and helplessly . How cruel you are ! What do I care about all those things ? It 's only you Hildegarde ! Going to her . You ! You ! Tearfully . You 're all I want ! Weeping . If I lose you , what will become of me ? Clutching her childishly and accusingly . I 'll just lose myself ! Shaking her . Do n't you see that I belong to you ? Do n't you see that ! ? Do n't punish me any more . Hoarsely shaken with sobs . he falls and clutches her knees . You ca n't treat me like this ! I ca n't stand it ! I 've been wrong ; but do n't punish me for what I could n't help ! LAWRENCE has delivered this last speech in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HILDEGARDE Larrie  --  Larrie . Do n't be absurd . Comforting him . Do n't cry , Larrie ,  --  you foolish , foolish boy ! p. 175 LAWRENCE Still holding her tightly . And you wo n't leave me ? HILDEGARDE Helplessly . How can I ? You 're such a child . She takes him in her arms .
