txt // gration officials to give more time and courtesy to the examination of the new arrivals than is possible in the crowded station at Ellis Island . Because of these conveniences in Boston , the port enjoys a growing popularity among immigrants . The best publicity among prospective immigrants in Europe consists of letters from their pleased countrymen who have entered at Boston . The growth of New England industries has furnished a valuable local territory for absorbing immigrant laborers . Boston 's Liverpool lines have been built largely on British and particularly Irish immigration to New England . The replacement of the British by a Continental stream of steeragers is reflected by the development of North European and Mediterranean lines . New York in Boston territory on British steeragers . A peculiar equalization of inland rates on British steerage passengers for New England has let New York into this territory more than would have been natural . An immigrant for Boston can reach Boston as cheaply via New York as via Boston itself . If he comes via New York he is given a free ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he is destined to a point nearer Boston than New York , and enters at New York , he pays the inland fare from Boston and is given a ticket from New York . For instance , an immigrant at New York for Providence pays 900 ( the Boston-Providence fare ) and is given a ticket to Providence on the New York-Providence boat . So far as inland fares are concerned , New York is moved up to Boston . In point of convenience in inland travel , Boston is still preferable ; the immigrant can reach // Providence on the day he lands in Boston , while he must wait for the night boat from New York . The equalization of Boston and New York rates on British immigrants to New England territory is not a matter of great importance . It does not generally apply to Continental and Mediterranean steeragers . In the case of these , Boston retains in inland fares the advantage of its location , though the New Haven publishes from New York to New England points , via its Sound Lines , lower immigrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fares including transfer from Ellis Island to the Sound Line boats . Russian outward steeragers at Boston . The one serious hindrance to the movement of local New England third-class passengers through Boston is in reference to Russians outbound . In order to return to his own country , a Russian must have a passport . Many of them come from Europe without passports , being smuggled across the border . Those who bring regular passports usually let them lapse because of the high annual tax payable to the Russian Government in order to keep the original passports alive . The usual way to return is with a consular certificate , or prochodnoje , issued by a Russian consular official in the United States . At the present time the Imperial Russian consul at Boston is not empowered to issue these prochodnojes ; he can obtain them only from the Consulate General in New York . The delays and expense of this procedure are such that many Russians from Boston itself pay their fares to New York and sail from there , in spite of the fact that the Hamburg-American Line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An inquiry sent to the principal agents selling outward steerage // tickets in 21 towns in the neighborhood of Boston showed that , during the first eight months of 1913 , these agents had sold 3,205 Russian outwards via New York and only 1,253 via Boston . By the Metropolitan District agents alone 1,799 tickets were sold via New York and only 711 via Boston . It is to be hoped that the necessary extension of powers will be conferred on the Boston consular office . CHAPTER VIII STRONGER BOSTON SOLICITATION IN THE WEST Stronger Boston solicitation in West . The development of the passenger business of Boston transatlantic lines has been described as an offset to the effect of differential freight rates . Another offset would be the strengthening of exclusive Boston soliciting forces in the West . Western export traffic is sought by three main sorts of solicitor : the western steamship freight agent , the western " commercial agent " of a railroad fast freight line , and the western representatives of New York forwarders or ocean freight brokers . In Boston , brokers should get commissions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is soliciting only for New York . One reason is that the brokers are allowed a commission of 1.25% on the freight rates of all traffic they book at New York . If a Boston forwarder gets exports sent to him in Boston he gets no commission on such traffic when he books it with the steamship line . Even the American Express Company gets no commission from the steamship companies on traffic booked at the port of Boston . The largest brokers and forwarding companies have offices in both New York and Boston , the home office being in New York . It does not increase their enthusiasm for Boston exports when they are allowed a freight commission at New York and not here . // Here there is opportunity for the steamship lines to correct an inequality by providing , under proper safeguards , to give the New York 1.25% commission to Boston brokers who bring them traffic . In Philadelphia also all brokers are allowed 1.25% commission on all freight they book . What a seaboard broker does . The seaport broker or forwarder is used particularly by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the cheapest steamship line , exchanges the inland for the ocean bill of lading , forwards the latter to the shipper , looks after prompt clearance , notifies the shipper of clearance and makes a return regarding weight and value to the Customs for statistical purposes . In some cases complicated proceedings are necessary to get the consular documents required for shipments , especially for shipments to Latin-American countries . The seaboard forwarder can consolidate small lots of export , and , by offering them as a larger lot , obtain a saving in ocean freight which is shared with the shipper . An L.C.L. exporter can not afford to maintain at the seaboard an export representative of his own , to look after his export shipments . The small inland shipper can save money if he can consolidate into a full car all his export shipments , send them to New York at the carload rate ? consigned to the broker , and pay the broker for distributing them to the various steamship lines . Boston 's extensive services . New York is of course the best port to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as , no matter where an individual shipment may be destined , foreign or coastwise , New York is sure to have a line to carry it . But Boston now reaches , with direct services , all leading British ports , // Hamburg , Italy , Havana , Central America and the Maritime Provinces . Mediterranean , Australian and African points are reached via transhipment at Liverpool or London or Hamburg ; Australia , for instance , usually as rapidly as via the infrequent direct services from New York . Evidence of weak western solicitation for Boston . A letter received from Springfield , Ohio , in response to a circular letter sent to traffic managers in the West , indicates the lack of solicitation , in that territory , of Boston forwarding people . Springfield is an L.C.L. export town . The letter follows : The Springfield Traffic Bureau , Springfield , 0 . , Feb. 5 , 1913 . Dear Sir : Acknowledging receipt of your favor of the 30th ult. , in which we are asked as to what conditions are operating against the flow of export @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itemize below some of the points which we believe have a bearing on that subject : 1st . The time made by freight from here to Boston does not compare favorably with the time to New York . It is our opinion that the railroads put forth greater efforts to rush New York export business than that destined to Boston . 2d . The infrequency of sailings from Boston . ( We are pleased to note that you are changing this. ) 3d . Business is sent through New York on account of a long-established habit . We do not believe that this is done on account of any prejudice against any other gateway , but rather on account of the consignors not taking the trouble to investigate the merits of Boston or other gateways . 4th . The lack of solicitation or boosting the port of Boston such as you are now doing . 5th . The activity of the numerous freight-forwarding // agents located in New York . Their solicitation in this territory is vigorous . We never heard of one from Boston . 6th . A very small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our manufacturers combine their own export shipments or in conjunction with other manufacturers and move the business at carload rates , which makes a very material saving not only in the freight but in the lighterage charges . Under these conditions there may be one shipment in a car which would find prompt accommodation2 and several others which would be delayed , whereas New York could promptly move each shipment . ' 7th . Our opinion so far as applying to this territory is , that the shippers themselves are the ones who must be educated to the fact that New York is not the only American port . We would estimate that 90 per cent of the prices made on export shipments are f. o. b . New York . In fact a great many catalogues show prices covering that delivery . Yours truly , THE SPRINGFIELD TRAFFIC BUREAU . Equalize Boston with New York and Philadelphia . There is need , and , with the extension of Boston 's oversea services , opportunity , for an increased activity of Boston brokers and their connections in the West . Equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissions paid , would help supply them with the incentive for extending their western solicitation for exports via this port ; and it would increase interest for Boston on the part of New York firms with branches here . The brokers can offer via Boston the same export rates as New York and one advantage over New York ; // namely , in the free distribution , from the car , of shipments , to the different steamship lines . New York will give only three free lighterage deliveries to the contents of such a consolidated car ; further deliveries must be by team and paid for . Boston tariffs provide for free teaming of any number of " split shipments " in a consolidated car . An especial reason for increasing the interest of forwarders in shipments via this port is that they so enjoy the confidence of many shippers as to control the movement of their exports . The recent preponderance of manufactured goods in the export trade has largely increased the demand for the seaboard service which these brokers and forwarders render . Western agents of steamship lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consists of the western representatives of the steamship lines . For instance , the International Mercantile Marine Company has a General Western Freight Agent at Chicago , a Northwestern Agent at Minneapolis and a Southwestern Agent at St. Louis . The HamburgAmerican Line , Furness Withy &; Company , and other large freight-carrying lines have similar western representation . Besides soliciting freight for export at Boston these agents are also soliciting freight for the parallel services which they run out of ports competitive to Boston , and as they earn more on carryings out of Baltimore and Philadelphia , they can not be expected to throw any especial influence to the Boston service . As a matter of fact , these representatives solicit impartially freight for all direct services run by their companies . The steamship companies feel that they have done a great deal when they equalize the through rates via Boston with the // rates via the southern ports ; see , for instance , the equalization for the Boston-London service , in the table on page 125 . When , in spite of this equalization , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Philadelphia boats , the steamship lines feel tha. * they are not having adequate help from the traffic forces of the Boston railroads . Commercial agents of fast freight lines . Railroad solicitation of export freight is performed by the western representatives of " fast freight lines . " For a long time there were separate sets of lines east and west , respectively , of Buffalo and Pittsburgh . To provide for through cars , through routes and through rates between points on eastern and points on western lines , " fast freight lines " were jointly established , sometimes jointly owning special through cars which , without breaking bulk , ran through over the rails of eastern and western members . But essentially they were traffic organizations soliciting through freight for this particular route . Eventually nearly every eastern line came to have a fast freight line in connection with every western road , though now each road has one or two connections with which it works preferably . When eastern and western lines are one road , as in the case of the Pennsylvania east and west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then the fast freight line of the road becomes its traffic organization dealing with through business . Such are the Star Union Line of the Pennsylvania , the Erie Despatch of the Erie , the Red Line and the Blue Line of the New York Central system . The " fast freight " solicitors of the West , being interested in through business , also solicit export freight . There is a repreSTRONGER // sentative of every such line , called a " commercial agent , " in every western center of importance . New England members of fast freight lines . These through routes attach to their fast freight lines short roads in the Middle West and also lines east of the Hudson River . The Boston &; Albany is a member only of New York Central fast freight lines . But the Boston &; Maine and New Haven have long been members of all the leading fast freight lines , including those of the New York Central . The New England road participates in the support of each of these traffic organizations in proportion to the volume of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Minor interest of lines in Boston . It might be supposed that , as the Boston &; Maine participates in the support of these organizations , their fast freight employees are in duty bound to solicit as zealously for Boston as for New York or any other port . But the contributions of the Boston road come after the traffic has been sent here . It pays for traffic sent to Boston , not for sending it here . The fast freight organization is appointed , instructed and controlled by the eastern trunk line , which in every case has another home port than Boston . Effect when through rates via Boston lower . The shipper has a right to route his freight as he chooses . When the through rate is lower via Boston , he is fairly certain to book his export for a Boston boat . Then nearly every commercial agent is soliciting that freight to move to Boston via his line . If it is once booked to sail from Boston , there is no chance to influence it via any other port , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . // When through rates are equal . If every shipper picked his boat before consulting the fast freight men , they would have little influence on routing . Many shippers ? for instance in Duluth ? get their ocean rate quotations from the commercial agents , letting them stand the expense of wiring to Chicago for rates . When the quotations come back , the through rate to Europe on flour , for example , is likely to turn out to be the same via all ports . Then the influence of the commercial agents is used in favor of their home ports , by such methods as expressed or implied preference or promises of prompt car supply and service . The shipper knows that the Erie Despatch man prefers New York . He knows that the Erie Railroad alone will be responsible for prompt export service to New York ; if freight moves to Boston , the Erie shares the responsibility of service with the Delaware &; Hudson and the Boston &; Maine . A possible exception to this rule is the New York Central , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exports to Boston as to New York . In the 1904-1905 1 ) i ffcrential Case , Mr. Eaton , Western Agent of the Erie , referring particularly to flour , testified as follows ( Bearings , p. 705 ) : With equal through rates , I should say that there are more instances where the bookings and the routing of freight beyond the Atlantic seaboard are left to the railroad , than cases where the shippers express their preference . Boston steamships miss railroad help . As a result of the lack of Boston solicitation in the West , the steamship people say that it is easier to get freight for other ports than Boston , on equalized through rates . No one in the West is telling shippers of the // advantages of using this port ; for instance , that it has New York 's export rail rates and usually ocean rates low enough to offset Baltimore and Philadelphia 's differential , that fast passenger steamers increase the port 's advantage of being a day 's sail nearer Europe and that Boston has for provision shipments an " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to that of Montreal . Western shippers talk of New England roads as a great terminal yard , complacently switching domestic traffic which is bound to come to New England any way , and indifferent to the export business , highly competitive and moved at lower than domestic rates . For education , a traffic department of Port Directors . To systematically carry on this work of education among shippers , the Boston Port Directors should have a small traffic department of their own . The work of such a traffic department is so well illustrated by the development of the port of Manchester that Manchester 's organization deserves examination in some detail . The example of Manchester . One of the most successful examples of port development is that of Manchester , England . It has proceeded essentially along traffic lines . In 1894 , after heavy expenditure made by a private company and by the city after the company 's resources gave out , a ship canal was opened , 35 miles long , connecting Manchester with the sea . It has cost $80,000,000 . To get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second port of England . In Liverpool were concentrated all the steamship lines serving the north of England ; there were located the merchants who handled export and import goods ; railroad lines radiated from Liverpool // and got their longest haul , and largest earnings , when traffic moved through that port . When the ship canal was finished , and docks , sheds , grain elevators and belt line were constructed , Manchester was by no means a port . Organization of Manchester 's Traffic Department . It was the Traffic Department of the Manchester Ship Canal Company which engaged the steamship lines that now make Manchester the third port in the United Kingdom , and induced diem to give Manchester the same ocean rates as Liverpool . This department brought about a readjustment of rail rates , between interior points and Manchester and Liverpool respectively ? a readjustment that gave Manchester the advantage of its greater nearness to the manufacturing centers of the North . The railroads now allow to the belt line rate divisions which make it self-supporting . The charges levied on ships and goods for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each article of traffic moving . In every case inducement is left for the traffic to move via Manchester , rather than a rival gateway . Its field force . The Traffic Department has thirteen or fourteen solicitors traveling out of Manchester in the manufacturing centers . These solicitors carry the rate cards of Manchester steamer lines and demonstrate to the shipper that he gets the same ocean rate out of Manchester and a lower inland rate than to Liverpool ; that his carload shipments will be delivered alongside the ship at Manchester without the cartage usually necessary at Liverpool , etc . These Manchester solicitors do not book freiglit ; it is booked by the local agent of the originating carrier . But , having persuaded the shipper , they call in the local // representative of the Manchester steamship line and he makes a contract with the shipper covering one shipment or all shipments for a year . That is , the Manchester Ship Canal solicitors are working for all steamship lines in Manchester . In order to be considered impartial , they accept no commissions from either railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ship Canal Company , which means the port of Manchester . . The stake of the latter is partly the charges paid by ships and goods using its belt line , docks and canal ; but particularly the growth of the port 's steamship connections and the resulting prosperity of the city of Manchester , which is the principal holder of the Canal Company 's securities . Representatives in other English ports . This Traffic Departxnernt also has traffic representatives in London , Liverpool and hull . The business of these men is to find out what traffic is moving through those rival ports destined to or coming from the territory geographically tributary to Manchester . They find out who controls that traffic and he is approached and urged to give it to Manchester . A London importing house may give the information that goods it imports for the account of a Birmingham buyer are sold f. o. b . Birmingham ; hence the routing is directed by the foreign seller . The foreign traffic representative of the Canal Company , located nearest to that seller , is then instructed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad . Foreign representatives are maintained in the leading countries trading with the north of England ; for instance , in the United States , Canada , Australia and New Zealand . In . Toronto is a representative who has an assistant continually traveling for him and who // travels some himself . The New York office has a manager and two traveling agents , besides an office force . One of these traveling agents confines himself to New York alone ; one travels mostly in the West ; in addition , the New York manager regularly visits the largest shippers . Foreign agents are not main-tained in near-by countries such as Spain and Italy . These are covered by the Manchester home office which , for instance , every year sends a man to Italy before olive oil is shipped , and to Spain before grapes move , in order to inform and solicit the leading shippers there . A considerable amount of literature is regularly issued by the Canal Company . The most important piece is a regular monthly pamphlet called " Man-chester Sailing List and Shipping Guide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the rest of the pamphlet does not change . This booklet contains information regarding the history of the canal ; the charges for use of the canal and the docks ; illustrations of savings on inland rates and terminal charges effected by using Manchester rather than Liverpool ; a list of all oiicMls ind representatives of the Canal Company with their addresses ; advertise-ments of the Manchester steamship lines and the Manchester freight brokers and forwarders . Boston is like Manchester . It will be seen that Manchester has a traffic organization of world-wide scope , educating shippers and soliciting freight . Its co-operation is the most valuable inducement that can be offered to a prospective steamship line . Boston 's situation , overshadowed by New York , is not unlike that of Manchester , subject to the overwhelming competition of Liverpool . The same measures will // be effective here as there . The present extensive Manchester organization is the result of evolution ; Boston does not at first need such wide connections , but it should start its organization now . Port Directors ' traffic department . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic manager , who would be part of the permanent force of the Directors and co-ordinate with the chief engineer . This manager should have an assistant , who , among other things , would keep a rate file of the land and water rates affecting Boston water lines ; and a traveling agent who , under direction of the traffic manager , would regularly cover the exporters of New England , the Middle West and Eastern Canada . Once a year the traffic manager himself should visit each of the largest of these exporters . The shippers should be encouraged to feel that this department is the one to turn to for rectification of inland or ocean rate adjustments that keep traffic from moving through Boston . A great many obstacles to this movement would come to light , now kept hidden by those whose interest it is to do so . Ways to remove these obstacles would be devised . The Department would be a reservoir of information for New England exporters and importers . What it would accomplish . The information collected from many sources by the traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamship lines and negotiate for desired extensions of Boston 's services . The traffic department should prepare and regularly distribute a pamphlet of information for shippers , modeled on the " Sailing List and Shipping Guide " of the Manchester Ship Canal Company . Finally , the traffic department // should do the work of the industrial commissioner of a railroad ; that is , it should have charge of the business of attracting tenants to the State 's lands at South Boston and East Boston . With the aid of this department , the-Port Directors would be able to formulate and pursue the broadest traffic policy , looking to the development of the port . Most " port development " in the United States is based on instinct and enthusiasm rather than the business information that should be the basis of public as well as private expenditure and action . The traffic department should save the Port Directors and the State from errors being committed elsewhere . The institution of a traffic department would be a strong evidence to steamship companies of the earnestness with which port development in Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines along which it must develop if at all . The traffic manager should be a practical transportation man of high caliber . Its organization . The traveling agent covering inland exporters would primarily serve the purpose of educating them to the use of Boston and keeping them in touch with the port 's progress , as in the extension of its steamship lines or the rise of new seaboard trade agencies capable of handling the exporters ' shipments . As in the case of the Manchester men , when the traveling agent found a shipper ready to make a shipment or a contract , he would bring him in contact with the western representative of the Boston steamship lines . Steamship companies have expressed their willingness to have their western representatives work in harmony with such an agent of the Port Directors . // Its later extension . Later it will no doubt be found advisable to extend this organization . It will be found desirable to have a representative located in Chicago , with at least one man traveling for him . In Chicago are concentrated the general western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large proportion of export traffic moving . Memphis , Minneapolis , St. Louis and other export centers are quickly reached from Chicago . It will also be found desirable to have a man located in Buffalo , which is destined to play a much more important part than at present in export traffic , and which , because of its equal rates to all Atlantic ports , is of especial interest to Boston . It will be found desirable to have a foreign representative in England and one on the Continent , in order to reach foreigners who control the routing of export or import shipments that might move via this gateway , and in order to keep in closer touch with the home offices of foreign steamship lines . But these developments will come naturally when the effectiveness of a traffic organization is demonstrated . The important thing is to get it started in the modest way outlined above . Need of Boston railroad agents in West . There should also be in the West representatives of Boston railroads , engaged in soliciting export freight for Boston . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secure western exports in that it has no railroad line of its own beyond the Hudson River . All its traffic must come from rail lines whose primary interest is to carry the traffic to some other port . Under these circumstances it is not enough for Boston roads to have equal rail rates with New York . They // need active solicitation in the West ; the fast freight lines of which they are members can not be relied on to give them that solicitation . All other ports represented in West . Baltimore has two rail lines to Chicago : the Baltimore &; Ohio and the Pennsylvania . ' Chicago is full of Baltimore &; Ohio solicitors . The Star Union Line ( Pennsyl-vania ) maintains there an export agent with an extensive organization . He has educated the Star Union Line men throughout the West in the solicita-tion and handling of export business . He issues to shippers ocean rate sheets giving rates at various ports , and is probably the most effective of all the western railroad agents , with regard to influence upon the routing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baltimore &; , Ohio , the Pennsylvania , and the Philadelphia &; Reading . The Chicago representation of the Baltimore &; Ohio and the Pennsylvania has been described . The Philadelphia &; Reading does not get west of Williams-port , Pa . It is the Boston &; Maine of Philadelphia , a stub line dependent for traffic on what is handed to it by the trunk lines , each with a home port of its own . The Philadelphia &; Reading maintains in Chicago an office with a manager and several Reading men traveling out of it . Their especial care is the export business . The New York railroads are represented by the commercial agents of fast freight lines belonging to these roads , and also by Lackawanna and Lehigh Valley offices , distinct from the representation of their // fast freight lines . Montreal is represented by the strong solicitation of the line men of the Grand Trunk and the Canadian Pacific . In the winter their efforts are turned to Portland and St. John , respectively . Only Boston has no representation . When the New Haven was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Haven decided to enter the export business . It engaged for its South Boston docks a line to Antwerp and a line to Manchester . ' The New Haven established a foreign freight agent in Boston and opened offices for New Haven representa-tives in both Buffalo and Chicago . In addition , it devoted one of its New York soliciting force to cover-ing New Yorkers controlling the routing of export and import freight , in order to have them move their shipments via Boston . With the entrance into power of the late New Haven regime , it was decided that the export business did not pay . The New Haven representatives , engaged in facilitating it , were with-drawn , and the steamship lines were forced to the Boston &; Albany and Boston &; Maine piers . The New Haven then stayed out of the foreign trade until it was brought into it again by the institution of Commonwealth Pier 5 , at South Boston . The situation is in no way changed today . There is still the same need for western railroad solicitation for the Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter up . The steamship lines of the port deserve this aid from the inland carriers of their freight . They deserve it particularly because of the western aid given by railroads to foreign lines // at other ports ; and because of the geographical and commercial weakness of Boston , with respect to getting western export traffic . The Boston &; Maine and Boston &; Albany and the New Haven should each have an export agent at Chicago , covering the Middle West . C A SOLUTION OF THE TRAFFIC PROBLEM CHAPTER IX CANADIAN GRAIN PRODUCTS Boston must be a freight port . Development of passenger business through Boston has been described as one offset to the effect of the differentials . A second offset would be the strengthening of Boston 's soliciting forces in the competitive West . This would enable Boston to get a fairer share of the exports of this territory . But the worst effect of the differentials remains : the subsidy they offer to steamship lines to handle the exports of the West at a differential port , by offering these lines additional earnings via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of operation to those ports . The offsets described may mitigate the severity of Boston 's problem , but they do not solve it . Passenger business is seasonal . If Boston is to attain real greatness , it must be a freight port . To develop Boston as a freight port , the steamers must be supplied with export traffic on which they can earn as much as they could by taking that traffic elsewhere . Then , the lower steamship operating costs applicable to Boston will make them turn their influence this way . The only way in which Boston can become a second great seaport on the North Atlantic coast is to make it worth while for the steamship lines to make it so . Non-differential traffic necessary . Boston 's efforts in the last Differential Case , seeking equal export and import rates with Baltimore , were an attempt to have // the ban taken off the traffic of United States differential territory . It failed . Boston must now look elsewhere for non-differential traffic ; that is , traffic brought to this port on as low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , the steamship lines need not shrink their ocean rates in order to compensate the higher Boston rail rates . This may be safely stated as the chief problem of the port of Boston . Where it may come from . This traffic may be of three main sources : from New England , Buffalo and Canada . Boston can not complain of its present quota of New England export freight . Most of its coarse exports , such as apples and cotton waste , move for export at Boston . There can be no just complaint that export rail rates from New England points are unfair to Boston and tend to take oversea traffic to New York . When New England manufactured exports go to New York there is generally some good reason for it . In some cases they are destined to points like South America , to which Boston has no sailings . In some cases they are sent to New York in the interest of expedition , when the Boston outward service is a slow , indirect one , such as the Antwerp and Rotterdam services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of motorcycles who has a contract to deliver fifty motorcycles per week in London . Boston has no weekly London service , as it used to have ; therefore it is not in shape to contract for this traffic . In some instances the New England manufacturer does not export direct but sells to a New York commission house , which brings all shipments to New York to be consolidated and exported . But in general New England export shippers are loyal to Boston , which will get a still larger proportion of their traffic as soon as // its oversea connections are made more frequent and more extensive . If every pound of New England exports could be forced through this gateway , it would not save the situation . New England does not produce the bulk to fill ships . Buffalo . Buffalo is an export center of great promise . The mills which make grain products for eastern distribution and for export have expanded largely in Buffalo in recent years . The reason is that grain thus exported pays the low rate on grain down the Lakes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there east . Grain milled in the West pays the higher rate on grain products all the way east . In addition to an advantage in rates , Buffalo has the advantage of nearness ( which means rapid service ) to the Atlantic seaboard . The cheap transportation of grain in the Lake freighters is the making of Buffalo . The exports of oil cake ( from flax-seed ) by a single firm have already been referred to . One of the striking developments of the flour industry in recent years has been the growth of mills in Buffalo . In the daily capacity of its mills it is now easily the second milling center of the country . // Buffalo as a milling center . These Buffalo mills are run largely on export product ; for instance , most of Washburn Crosby 's exports come from their mill there , which can turn out 15,000 barrels per day . If Canadian wheat comes into this country free , as it will automatically when the Canadian duty on American wheat and flour is taken off , the present restrictions on milling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will become the largest miller of Canadian wheat for export . Canadian wheat milled in Buffalo would have its choice of ocean services of all United States Atlantic ports and , in addition , a marked advantage in rates and service to the whole consuming market of the Atlantic seaboard . Buffalo good Boston territory . It will be recalled that export rates from Buffalo to Boston , New York , Philadelphia and Baltimore are the same . They are , in cents per 100 pounds , 8.5 ? on oil cake , 9.5 ? on flour , 10.5 ? on iron and steel products . Therefore no higher ocean rate can be earned on this traffic out of Balti-more or Philadelphia than out of Boston . In the case of flour , for instance , the Boston lines generally earn the Baltimore ocean rate on Buffalo shipments . Boston can look with the greatest satisfaction upon the devel-opment of Buffalo . Everything produced there , rather than in United States differential territory , is moved out of the ban and into the zone of influence of New York and Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the soliciting forces of Boston rail-roads , and of the traffic department of the Port Directors , can be turned with profit and success . ' // Canada . But the principal field to which Boston should look for its export tonnage is Canada . Boston has always been considered , even by the Canadians , as the " natural " overflow port for the growing volume of Canadian grain and grain products which , as the Canadian roads know , can not be forced through the narrow gateway represented by Canada 's summer port of Montreal , and its far-away winter ports of Portland , St. John and Halifax . It has been expected that Boston would come into its own as Canadian wheat replaced United States wheat for export , and that the monopoly of the differential ports , based on the carriage of this United States grain , would be broken . Yet , as Canadian exports have increased , they have not seemed to flow through Boston , which seems to get no particular advantage from its relation to Canada . A study of the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not lead to Boston , and having applied to it the differential rates constructed to protect the southern ports on United States grain . Quietly , and without protest , a rate discrimination is crystallizing which , unless it is promptly met , will result in Baltimore and Philadelphia appropriating Canada as they have the American Middle West . Boston 's last chance as a freight port disappears if it allows its rivals to appropriate this , its legitimate export field , which , in its possibilities for the future , is the most promising of all areas on the continent . The danger is so great , and the stake so large , that the subject deserves the most careful attention . Decline of United States grain exports . The staple upon which the British and European services of all American ports are built is the carriage of grain , // especially wheat . A small quota of wheat for a liner to carry from a United States outport is 100,000 bushels ( 2,600 tons ) . Two hundred thousand bushels ( 5,200 tons ) is not an unusual item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liverpool . Great Britain , Germany , Scandinavia , France , Italy and Spain produce less wheat than they consume , particu-larly the three first named . The highly developed North Atlantic trade was built upon the carriage of wheat to Europe and the bringing back of immigrants to produce more wheat . But the United States is ceasing to have a large exportable surplus of wheat . The immigrants have been more and more turning to the high wages offered in our industries , especially as free government land began to give out . Mouths to be fed have increased more rapidly than workers to feed them ; in the last ten years our wheat production has not advanced ; the surplus available for export has dropped . This is shown in the following table : Only New York unaffected . The year 1913 shows a recovery in American wheat exports , due to the // exceptional wheat crop of 1912 . But the United States can not be counted upon to supply Europe with wheat much longer ; the rapid tendency is to consume our own product . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the decline in United States flour exports has been aided by the development of modern mills in foreign ports , supplied with American machinery . These mills are beginning to market flour more cheaply than mills in the American interior , because bulk wheat can be carried abroad more cheaply than sacks of flour . In the last few years the complaints of American flour millers have multiplied regarding the increasing spread between ocean rates on flour and wheat , respectively . The drop in wheat and flour exports has been a most serious matter for North Atlantic ports other than New York . Baltimore and Philadelphia have seen the usefulness of their differential decline , for the two exports which it most affected , dropped off . New York has steadily progressed , for , with its network of services and its perfected trade agencies , it was in position to handle the exports of United States manufactures which have replaced our shipments of foodstuffs . The differential had no effect on these manufactures ; 60 ? per ton on automobiles is not an item to be considered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has not had the compensation which New York has had . Canadian breadstuffs export grows . United States exports of breadstuffs are clearly destined to be replaced by Canadian exports . The wheat production of Manitoba , Saskatchewan and Alberta ( western Canada ) advanced from 17,000,000 bushels in 1900 , to 82,000,000 bushels in 1905 , to 119,000,000 bushels in // 1910 , to 198,000,000 bushels in 1912 and 189,116,000 bushels in 1913.1 In spite of the high wages offered by Canada 's protected industries , more immigrants have been drawn to the farms than to the towns ; the surplus of wheat for export has increased . The progress of Canadian exports of breadstuffs towards replacing those of the United States is illustrated in the following table : Canadian flour for Great Britain . Canadian flour is largely exported to Great Britain . For instance , in 1912 , 2,339,000 barrels went to Great Britain out // of 3,735,000 barrels exported . In 1913 , 2,880,000 barrels went to Great Britain out of 4,478,000 barrels in all . Boston , with its large steamship tonnage trad-ing with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic ; it has two or three sailings per week to Liverpool , ' one fortnightly to London and one fort-nightly to Manchester . Discrimination in rail rates on western Canadian flour . Because of a rate discrimination which has passed with little notice , Canadian flour milled in the West is subjected to the American differentials . Until 1913 the only route available for western Canadian flour was via the Canadian Pacific Railroad , all-rail , or Lake-and-rail . All-rail flour , which moved only when the Lakes were closed , moved on an equal rate of 21.5 ? from Fort William to St. John , Portland , Boston , New York , Philadelphia or Baltimore . The same rate carried other grain products . During the summer , Lake-and-rail flour moved via the Canadian Pacific Railroad boats from Fort William to Port McNicoll , the lower Lake port of the railroad , thence via Canadian Pacific Railroad and connections to // Boston , New York , Philadelphia and Baltimore . The Lake-and-rail rate from Fort William to all ports was 14.5 ? . per 100 pounds . In 1913 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy for the Canadian Pacific Railroad to handle , in addition to its own Canadian business ; so it invited the Mutual Transit Company , a Lake line owned by a number of New York trunk line railroads , to institute a service from Fort William to Buffalo . Apparently without opposition at the ports of New York and Boston , the regular American differentials were applied to this traffic . The rates from Fort William now read : On other grain products than flour the differentials are higher , namely : The American differentials apply . These are the regular United States export flour differentials on grain products which apply on American shipments from Duluth . Western Canadian grain products are , during the season of open Lake navigation , seven months of the year , withdrawn from the zone of neutral traffic to which they have always belonged and to which they still belong in the winter months , when equal all-rail rates apply from Fort William to all // American ports . The basis on which Lake-and-rail differentials on United States flour are defended is similar to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Middle West and the Northwest has a differential to Philadelphia and Baltimore , due primarily only to their greater nearness to the territory producing this flour . It is argued that Baltimore and Philadelphia should not be deprived of their geographical advantages because of the fact that this flour , during the season of open navigation , chooses a route which is rail-and-water , instead of all-rail . By Lake-and-rail , Baltimore and Philadelphia enjoy no advantage of distance over New York . In the case of such exports for all ports the flour follows the same route to Buffalo ; thence the distance to Philadelphia is 406 miles , to New York 399 , to Baltimore 397 . No justification of differentials on Canadian flour . Baltimore and Philadelphia can not claim an all-rail differential on western Canadian flour for export , on which to base a demand for a Lake-and-rail differ= ential , for the all-rail rate is 21.5 ? from Fort William to all United States ports . They can not claim greater nearness nor a long-established trade built on this rate advantage , for the rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differential territory , for Buffalo is east thereof ; all export rates from Buffalo are the same to all United States ports . Boston and New York have reason to institute a complaint before the Interstate Commerce Commission charging discrimination in the matter of Lake-andrail export rates on Canadian grain products to United States ports . This discrimination against Boston will grow more important , for the milling of Canadian // spring wheat for export is concentrating largely west of the Lakes . Eastern Ontario flour . The flour milled in eastern Ontario for export is primarily from western grain brought to Georgian Bay ( Lake Huron ) ports such as Port McNicoll , Tiffin and Goderich . From these points the grain moves on a milling-in-transit rate ; that is , it can be stopped at a point en route , milled into flour and forwarded , as if the movement had been a through one . Two of the principal milling centers en route are Peterborough ( Ontario ) and Montreal . The export milling-in-transit rate on this Georgian Bay grain is 12 ? per 100 pounds to St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the route and the rate on which the larger portion of Canadian export flour for Boston moves . There are no rates on this traffic to Baltimore or Philadelphia . Canadian flour through United States outlets . The growth of Canadian flour exports via United States outlets is seen in the following table : // Boston needs Canadian flour . It is well that the movement of Canadian flour through Boston has increased , for the differentials have seriously de-creased the movement through this port of United States flour , which dropped steadily from 862,000 barrels in 1907 to 238,000 barrels in 1913.1 Boston can view with satisfaction the growth of Canadian milling in eastern Ontario ; though unfortunately the center of export milling is shifting to the West . Boston will profit if Canadian wheat is eventually admitted free into this country and milled at Buffalo ; for though Baltimore and Philadelphia will have on such flour equal rates with Boston , the flour will not have the far lower inland rates to Montreal which the eastern Ontario product now enjoys , nor the lower rates to United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Boston steamship lines do not need lower inland rates than other United States ports ; they only need an equality . Canadian oatmeal in bond . The other largely exported Canadian grain product is oatmeal . The export business originates largely in eastern Ontario mills , principally Peterborough ; and is milled from both western oats via Georgian Bay and the large local oats crop of eastern Ontario . The Georgian Bay product moves on the same 12 ? milling-in-transit rate // as wheat flour for export . Boston gets an even larger share of oatmeal than of wheat flour : CHAPTER X CANADIAN GRAIN Canadian wheat all-rail . It is in the matter of Canadian wheat for export , particularly from Buffalo , that the principal discrimination against Boston lies . If Canadian wheat moved and overflowed through Canadian channels , Boston would profit from that overflow . But Canadian routes can not carry the traffic , and it is seeking the outlet of the least resist-ance ; namely , Buffalo . Wheat ex-Georgian Bay . Canada has several Buffalos at the eastern end of Lake Huron . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port south of Boston . For instance , during the past winter the rates have been , on wheat : Boston well off on Georgian Bay wheat . In years gone by , Boston has always had the same ex-Lake rates from Georgian Bay as St. John and Portland have had . The recent discrimination of 0.5 ? per bushel is no doubt a result of the attempt to force Canadian export traffic to move through Canadian ports . But , at any rate , Boston has been as well off as her North // Atlantic rivals in the matter of all-rail Canadian grain , and better off with regard to export grain from the lower Canadian Lake ports . How Canadian wheat moves . Canadian export wheat originates west of Winnipeg . The harvest is from two to four weeks later than in the United States Northwest , so the Canadian wheat is moved with all speed to the head of the Great Lakes , to Fort William ( Canadian Pacific and Grank Trunk Pacific ) and to Port Arthur ( Canadian Northern ) . There are two months and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from about September 15 to December 1 , when the Lakes close . Long before December 1 all the elevators at the lower Lake ports have been choked with grain , and the late arriving boats lie in the lower ports storing their grain until the elevators have been relieved , by shipments to the seaboard , and can accommodate more grain . Other freighters winter in the upper Lake ports , storing grain that has arrived after the Lakes were closed and has found the elevators full . Finally , the interior elevators in the West are held full during the winter . The export wheat moves during the winter out of the lower Lake elevators , which are then free to handle grain from the head of the Lakes when navigation opens . Small all-rail movement . The all-rail movement to the seaboard from the Canadian west is largely confined to wheat that can not be sent down the Lakes before the season of navigation is over , or that can not be held until that season opens again , about the last week of April . This all-rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the single track line of the Canadian Pacific . Insufficient Canadian elevator capacity east of // Lakes . Neither the elevator capacity of the lower Canadian Lake ports , nor that of the Canadian sea-ports is capable of handling this grain as fast as it is moved through the western elevators and down the Lakes . This is apparent from an examination of the storage capacity of the elevators in question . It will be remembered that when Montreal is open , Halifax , St. John and Portland are not ; and vice versa . Grain must overflow to Buffalo . It is perfectly natural that , when the rush of grain is heavy in the fall , the 22,500,000 bushel storage capacity of Buffalo should be sought , particularly in recent years when the capacity is less utilized by the disappearing exports of American wheat . Buffalo is a better place to store wheat for the winter than Georgian Bay , because it has ex-Lake rates to the ports and ocean services of Boston , New York , Philadelphia and Baltimore ; whereas there are ex-Lake rates from Georgian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fort William to Montreal . All-water . In the // spring , when navigation opens , no port can make any export bookings of Canadian grain from the elevators at the head of the Lakes until the capacity of Montreal liners is booked full . That is because of the cheap all-water route to Montreal via Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River . Over this route grain may move , in steamers drawing 14 feet , all the way from Fort William to Montreal ; or may move to Port Colborne ( opposite Buffalo ) in a larger steamer drawing 21 feet and carrying up to 400,000 bushels , and there be transhipped into a 14-foot steamer capable of passing through the locks of the Welland and St. Lawrence canals . In either case there is a summer rate aver-aging 5 ? or less per bushel . Transfer to the steamer at Montreal costs 0.25 ? . Insurance averages 0.6 ? per bushel . So the cost to put Fort William grain on board a Montreal steamer is about 5.85 ? per bushel . Fort William to Montreal . Lake-and-rail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgian Bay ports to Montreal of 5 ? per bushel , including elevation at the Lake port and at Montreal . This puts Fort William grain on board the steamer at Montreal for about the following cost : Fort William to Buffalo . This coming summer the ex-Lake export rate from Buffalo to New York or Boston is to be 5.5 ? per bushel . The cost of getting // Fort William wheat on board a Boston or New York steamer will be about as follows , per bushel : Limitations of Montreal . If there were an indefinite supply of 14-foot Lake steamers to carry grain to Montreal , if there were indefinite elevator capacity at that port , and if grain always moved abroad in cargo lots , tramps would be brought by the hundreds to Montreal , and all Canadian wheat in the summer would move through that port . Fortunately for the American North Atlantic ports , the limitations indicated operate at Montreal during the summer season . Then , late in November , when the movement of the new crop is just in full swing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of April . At all times there are liners at the ports from Boston to Baltimore which are seeking Canadian wheat to fill the space made empty by the disappearance of American wheat exports . Movement of Canadian wheat in bond . As a result , in spite of higher inland rates , Canadian wheat is seeking the outlet via United States ports to an increasing degree ; and seeking the outlet via Buffalo . Of 132,000,000 bushels of wheat shipped from Fort William and Port Arthur in the 1913 season of navigation , 68,000,000 were destined for American ports , nearly all to Buffalo . ' In the past two years the // exports of Canadian wheat via Canadian and United States ports have been as follows : Overflow via Buffalo bound to continue . It will be observed that the United States ports are getting more and more of the Canadian wheat exports . This tendency can not but proceed . In the days when American wheat was being exported at the rate of 200,000,000 bushels annually , the capacity of all ports , from Boston to Galveston , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose that the Canadian exports , which will soon reach and exceed this figure , can be forced through Montreal during seven months of the year ; and for five months through Portland and St. John // and Halifax . Hence the vital necessity to Boston of guarding the neutrality of Buffalo , the American out-let of this traffic . Buffalo not in differential territory . It will be recalled that Buffalo is not in differential territory , which does not begin until just east of Erie . Buffalo has always had rates to the seaboard lower than the other so-called trunk line termini : Pittsburgh , Wheel-ing , Salamanca , etc . This is because Buffalo has had the Erie Canal to compete with . Other trunk line termini have had rates to the seaboard 60% of the rates from Chicago ; Buffalo rates are 50% . Differ-ential territory begins with 60% points . As Buffalo is not in differential territory , there is no reason why traffic from or via Buffalo should be subjected to the port differentials , designed to affect only that com-petitive zone . Any differential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special justification . East of differential line non-competitive . The territory east of the differential line is regarded as non-competitive . This has always been taken for granted in the cases before the Interstate Commerce Commissioner Clark in his 1912 Decision on the Differ-ential Cases , p. 67 : There is a heavy movement of import and export traffic through the several ports which has destination or origin at the port or at points not situated in the differential territory . In making the differential agreement , it was apparently con-ceded that the territory east of the Buffalos-Pittsburgh line was largely non-competitive , and that the import and export traffic having destination or origin therein would and should find its way to the natural or most convenient port . // Buffalo is New York and Boston territory . His-torically , geographically and commercially , Buffalo is local New York and Boston territory . For decades it was dependent upon transportation on the Erie Canal and the following roads to New York : Lehigh Valley ; Delaware , Lackawanna &; Western ; Erie ; New York Central . It was not until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia ever got into Buffalo . In that year the Pennsylvania bought its way in ; no other Baltimore or Philadelphia road has gained an entrance since . In spite of the fact that Buffalo , and traffic via Buffalo , is naturally tributary to New York and Boston , concessions have been made to the southern ports on this traffic , with respect to American grain or grain products . Equal rates to all ports on local Buffalo exports . The basis for this has always been that that traffic originated in differential territory and , as there was an all-rail differential on it in favor of the southern ports , they deserved a differential even if it moved down the Lakes . The clearest expression of this principle is in the Lake-and-rail rates on grain products for export . This traffic moves on through rates , uniformly 2 ? per 1.00 pounds below the all-rail rates and carrying the full all-rail differentials . There was a time when there was a similar differential on flour milled at Buffalo and shipped thence locally for export . The reason was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory . In 1898 this export rate was 1 ? per 100 pounds lower to Philadelphia and Baltimore than to New York and Boston . ' By 1905 , this Buffalo flour differential had // been removed , the local character of the shipment from Buffalo preponderating over the consideration that the raw material for the flour originated in the West . By 1905 , and ever since , with the exception of ex-Lake grain , there were no rates from Buffalo for export that were not the same for all ports , Baltimore and Boston inclusive . On page 58 of the 1905 decision , Commissioner Prouty states : Buffalo is not in differential territory , and so far as we can learn , no differential rates apply to the various ports . The export rate structure from Buffalo , then , is an equalization of Baltimore , Philadelphia , New York and Boston , the equalization being really a concession to southern ports , as the Buffalo territory is not competitive . What is the reason why these southern ports should have a differential on ex-Lake grain ? Ex-Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This ex-Lake grain does not move from the West to the seaboard on a through rate or a through bill of lading . It moves on local or proportional rates from its western point of origin to a Lake port such as Duluth or Milwaukee or Chicago . There it is rebilled and moves east , at the current charter rate for Lake boats , to the Buffalo elevator , where it is stored and shipped locally , on the Buffalo " at-and-east " export rate , to the seaboard . No one can claim that this is a through movement , in view of the final decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission itself thereon . The 1911 Complaint of the Chicago Board of Trade de-manded that the carriers east of Buffalo should be // required to accept , as their at-and-east rate on exLake grain , their east-of-Buffalo proportion on allrail grain . Commissioner Prouty in his decision refused to grant the contention . He held that the divisions of through rates accepted by carriers on competitive traffic , were not a measure of a reasonable local rate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local rates . It obviously requires some exceptional justification to except ex-Lake rates from the uniform Buffalo export rate structure : one of equality to all ports . Ex-Lake based on all-rail grain differential . The justification put forward has already been mentioned . It is that this grain originates in United States differential territory and that the southern ports ought not to have their advantage of nearness to this territory , expressed in the all-rail grain differentials , defeated by a movement of the grain down the Lakes . The allrail rates have always been considered as expressing the rightful claim of the southern ports to the Middle West and all traffic originating there . Ex-Lake grain rates before .1898 . The 1882 decision of the Arbitration Commission made no mention of ex-Lake rates because the ex-Lake traffic in grain , by rail , was insignificant at that time . Prior to 1891 the railroads did not care to compete with the Erie Canal . In 1893 the question of ex-Lake differentials first arose . Off and on , the Baltimore and Philadelphia roads were granted differentials varying from 1/2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads continually opposed the application of this differential from Buffalo , whatever rates the Baltimore &; Ohio saw fit to give from its Lake port of Fairport , or the Pennsylvania from its Lake port of Erie . Whenever there was any traffic // moving , the New York roads cut their rates from Buffalo to meet the Fairport and Erie differentials . It has been seen that these New York roads considered ex-Lake grain to New York as intra-state traffic , not subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission or the maintenance of rates . From 1898 to the 1905 Case . In 1896 the Joint Traffic Association was formed . In 1896-1897 it published a 1 ? ex-Lake differential on wheat , corn and rye , to Philadelphia and Baltimore . The New York Produce Exchange protested strongly , and in 1898 the Joint Traffic Association published identical rates for all ports . The Association was dissolved by law in 1898 . In 1898-1903 , except for a short period in 1902 , there were equal rates to all ports . In 1902 the Baltimore &; Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baltimore , under the Buffalo-New York rates . The other roads protested , but the Baltimore &; Ohio had no facilities for doing any large business through Fairport , and the rate was not met . In September , 1903 , the Lehigh Valley issued a tariff giving equal rates to all ports , but providing in a footnote for a differential of 0.4 ? per bushel on grain delivered in Philadelphia to a steamship alongside the elevator ( Philadelphia &; Reading ) . The Pennsylvania soon filed a duplicate of this tariff , applicable both from Buffalo and Erie . The New York roads met these cuts and a rate war ensued , with the result that in January , 1904 , the ex-Lake rates got down to 0.2 ? per bushel . These low rates had no time to do great harm to railroad revenues , as they applied only during the early part of 1904 , when the roads were cleaning up the storage at Buffalo . With the approach of the opening of navigation and the rush of grain down the // Lakes , these rates were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Chairman of the Trunk Line Association , pending their final arbitration by the Interstate Commerce Commission , to whom the railroads referred the matter as part of the 1904-1905 Differential Case . It can be properly said that the first effective system of ex-Lake export grain differ-entials from Buffalo began as the result of that 1904-1905 Case . 1898 decision ties ex-Lake and all-rail differentials . In its 1898 Differential Case decision the Commission did not pass upon ex-Lake rates , for they were no part of the proceedings . However , Commissioner Prouty , on pages 684-685 of that decision , does mention them . This ex-Lake grain traffic originates at the same points as the all-rail traffic and is , therefore , properly regarded as competitive . If , therefore , our decision in reference to the all-rail differentials is correct , it seems to follow all the more that the ex-Lake differentials should not be disturbed by us . The 1899 all-rail reduction . Between 1898 and 1905 an event occurred indicating that the export grain differentials were too high . It will be recalled that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the all-rail grain differentials . It was admitted that there should remain a differential on berth or parcel lots , while in the case of cargo lots it was superfluous , charter rates out of all ports being the same . It was impossible to distinguish between grain carried for berth or cargo shipment , respectively ; so the roads assumed that either method moved about the // same volume of grain , and they cut the all-rail differ-entials in two as a compromise . 1905 decision , fixing present ex-Lake differentials . The 1904-1905 Case is the most important one in this connection , for it fixed the ex-Lake differentials , which have applied ever since . Commissioner Prouty , on page 56 of that decision , recognizes the justice of the Lake-and-rail differential on flour , because it origi-nates in the West and moves on a through rate . He states ( page 58 ) that the distances from Buffalo to New York , Philadelphia and Baltimore are almost exactly the same , about 400 miles each . ' He admits that Buffalo is not in differential territory and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But ( page 78 ) the origin of the grain ? all-rail or ex-Lake ? is the same in both cases and the traffic is strictly competitive . It should not be re-garded as originating in Buffalo , since it is only there temporarily , in transit . Yet , he says , when this grain arrives in Buffalo , there is no reason growing out of the greater proximity of Baltimore and Philadelphia to the grain fields which justifies or requires a lower rate to these ports . The cheapest way in many cases for grain to reach the seaboard , he says ( page 74 ) , is by Lake to Buffalo , thence rail to the seaboard . It is a natural advantage of New York to be located on this // route ; by this route the cost of transportation from Buffalo to New York is no greater than to Baltimore or Philadelphia . Page 74 . The question of ex-Lake grain was incidentally referred to in the former case ( 1898 ) but not much consid-ered . It was there said that this grain originated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the all-rail or the Lake-and-rail route , and that . . . . the same reason which would justify a differential in one case would apply in the other . It would follow from this reasoning , that the differ-ential in both cases ought to be the same . Further reflection shows that the position taken in that opinion is not altogether tenable . Page 69 . It has been seen that the purpose of the differ-ential is to distribute this competitive traffic between the different ports If this grain reaches the seaboard by the all-rail route , the advantage of Baltimore is taken away in favor of New York and Boston to the extent of 1.50 per 100 lbs. , l and we think that when the grain arrives in Buffalo it is proper for the same reason to take away something from the ocean advantage of New York in favor of Baltimore . Exact weight of all-rail in ex-Lake rates . As a result of these considerations , Commissioner Prouty fixed a differential of 0.3 ? per bushel on ex-Lake grain for export , except oats and barley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The important differential is the 0.30 per bushel , applying to wheat and corn . The 0.30 is gotten by halving the lower all-rail differential on wheat , that of Philadelphia , amounting to 1 ? per 100 pounds , 0.60 // per bushel . It is interesting to see that this halving of the lower all-rail differential indicates that the Commissioner considered as of exactly equal weight the contention of Baltimore and Philadelphia that the grain was from differential territory , and the contention of New York and Boston that it was a local shipment from Buffalo . There is no Baltimore and Philadelphia argument to balance the latter contention in the case of Canadian grain ; for it does not come from differential territory . 1912 decision re-affirms ex-Lake rates . In his 1912 decision , Commissioner Clark simply re-affirms the Prouty ex-Lake differentials . He meets the argument that New York is nearer to Buffalo than Philadelphia , and practically as near as Baltimore , with the words : This question can not be determined upon the basis of distance alone . If it were , Baltimore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The interests of all concerned and the matter of lawful and controlling competition must , as will appear , be considered . Baltimore 's claim to ex-Lake rates . Baltimore and Philadelphia interests have repeatedly stated that their claim to an ex-Lake differential was based on the fact that the ex-Lake grain came from territory with regard to which their natural advantage had been for thirty years testified by their all-rail differentials . In the 1904-1905 Hearings ( pages 1748 , 1754 , 1755 ) , Mr. Thayer , Vice-President of the Pennsylvania , makes just this claim . On pages 2606 seq. , Mr. Wight , Traffic Manager of the Baltimore &; Ohio , states the case more in detail : If we did not have an ex-Lake differential , we should ask for a lower rate all-rail , as we should not be able to carry any // grain to Baltimore in the season of navigation . Rail lines from Buffalo let us have a differential from Fairport , rather than have us reduce on all-rail rates to meet competition . A great deal of grain originating in Indiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Lakes at Chicago or Toledo , and thus by Lake to Buffalo . We claim a right to an ex-Lake differential on this grain ; we have a natural right to grain from this territory , Southern Ohio , Indiana and Illinois . Philadelphia 's claim . In the 1912 Case a Pennsylvania official , Mr. Bates , made the same plea for exLake differentials : I think the wheat or the grain moving through Buffalo originates in the western territory , the differential to Baltimore and Philadelphia applying on the all-rail grain , and the movement through Buffalo is more or less competitive and in the same category as wheat coming from the same points of origin in a general way . Minor differential object : to divide United States grain . This dependence of the ex-Lake on the all-rail differential has been emphasized because it is really at the bottom of the second justification of the ex-Lake differentials ; namely , the exigencies of competition and the division of export traffic . Once admit the purpose and propriety of parceling out the grain traffic of the Middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impossible not to justify a similar ex-Lake differential to parcel out this same traffic among the various ports . Baltimore has at times interjected a sentimental plea into her claim to differentials from the Middle West ; she has enumerated the sacrifices which Baltimore has made to make possible the building of the // Baltimore &; Ohio , and the intimate trade relations between Baltimore and the Middle West ever since Maryland and Virginia settled it . These justifications do not apply to Canadian grain . Obviously , none of this reasoning applies to Canadian grain via Buffalo . Canada can not be said to be naturally tributary to Baltimore or Philadelphia . These cities made no costly sacrifice to build railroads into the Canadian Northwest ; nor can they claim to have settled it or established with it bonds of trade which must not be disturbed . The Commission has never sanctioned the parceling out of Canadian grain among American seaports . The Commission is free to take any stand it chooses upon rates applying to this grain . Above all , the ex-Lake rates on Canadian grain were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-rail differentials are , as has been seen , the evidence and measure of the superior rights of the southern ports in American grain traffic . CHAPTER XI CANADIAN GRAIN ( CONCLUDED ) Equal all-rail rates to United States ports . Canada has always been considered essentially as Boston territory . Boston has , of all ports , the closest com-mercial relations with Canada , being dominant in the eastern part of the Dominion , particularly in the Maritime Provinces . Until 1912 the only all-rail route open for the exportation of Canadian grain via American ports was north of the Great Lakes , over the line of the Canadian Pacific . The export rates from Fort William ' were the same to all ports , St. John to Baltimore inclusive , 23 ? per 100 pounds , and such are the rates by this route today . Grain for Boston via this route is carried by the Canadian Pacific to New-port , Vt. , and there handed over to the Boston &; Maine . If destined to New York , Philadelphia or Baltimore , the Canadian Pacific Railroad can carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other carriers unite to get it to Buffalo , whence it proceeds to the seaboard by the usual routes . ' The Canadian Pacific Railroad obviously has the longest haul and the largest revenues when it carries this grain to Newport for Boston export . This is what is meant when it is said that Boston is the natural outlet for the overflow of CanaCANADIAN // dian traffic . In reality it is a concession for the Canadian Pacific Railroad to give as low rates to New York , Philadelphia and Baltimore as to Boston . Distances from Fort William to United States ports . The distances to the four American ports are almost the same and are as follows : Ex-Lake differentials on Canadian wheat pass unnoticed . All the while that this equality of all-rail rates was applying on all-rail wheat to United States ports for export , there were being applied from Buffalo , on Canadian grain carried by boat from Fort William , the regular ex-Lake differentials on American grain . That is , Baltimore and Philadelphia were being allowed to extend ex-Lake differentials ? based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic from a territory in regard to which they enjoyed no all-rail differentials . It was a serious oversight for Boston and New York to let this discrimination creep in ; but it is not too late to remedy it now . The presumption for equal ex-Lake export rates to United States North Atlantic ports on Canadian wheat via Buffalo was , therefore , established by the equal export rates all-rail from Fort William via the Canadian Pacific Railroad . In 1912 all-rail wheat overflows via United States outlets . In 1912 the Grand Trunk Pacific and Cana-dian Northern had completed extensive networks of railroads west of Lake Superior . The Grand Trunk Pacific took Fort William as its Lake Superior port , the Canadian Northern used Port Arthur . The Cana-dian Northern now also reaches Duluth over its own rails . In the fall of 1912 a large harvest was about four weeks late and navigation on the Lakes closed long before the usual quota of grain had been moved down.l Grain kept coming in from the West , but all the elevators at Fort William and Port Arthur were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Canadian Northern and the Grand Trunk Pacific had no rail lines east of Port Arthur and Fort William . They had no interest in handing the overflow over to their rival , the Canadian Pacific Railroad . The latter itself saw that it would not be able to handle , over its single track line , its own wheat that kept coming . Wheat runs into United States differentials . So all three Canadian roads opened this traffic to the Ameri-can outlets . They did it by applying the Fort William // basis from the West to Minneapolis and Duluth . From Minneapolis and Duluth the routes east are via Chicago , the rate being 10 ? from either of these points to Chicago , whence the regular American differentials automatically apply to the seaboard . The rates to the seaboard from Minneapolis , Duluth and Fort William , which have the same rates from western Canadian points , were as follows : United States all-rail routes and differentials temporary . The Buffalo ex-Lake export differentials precede these all-rail differentials via Chicago and so can not be based upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accidental and is probably temporary . It is not likely that the Canadian Pacific Railroad double tracking is being completed , or the Grank Trunk Pacific and Canadian Northern lines east from Winnipeg are being made ready for operation in the winter of 1914 , without the expectation of utilizing these rails to capacity carrying Canadian grain during the winter . The rapid increase of elevator capacity at the Canadian head of the Lakes ' // will make it necessary to move less volume all-rail . If the Canadian roads can handle this all-rail movement they will not open it to American routes as heretofore . Even if they keep American outlets open , they will adjust their rates east of Fort William and Port Arthur . With 23 ? rates applying out of these centers to all ports from New York to St. John , and 21.5 ? out of Minneapolis and Duluth to Baltimore , certainly none of the full-cargo business can move except via Baltimore . It does not look as if the Canadian Government , which has heavily subsidized the Canadian Northern and the Grand Trunk Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out via American roads ; or as if the Canadian roads would do this in the first place . If a 21.5 ? rate is applied to St. John and Portland , it will no doubt also be applied to Boston . That is , it is very unlikely that the present Baltimore and Philadelphia all-rail differentials on Canadian export grain will stand after the three Canadian roads all have their rail connections complete to the East . These present accidental differentials are not based on any advantage of nearness , railroad domination or close commercial relations applying to Baltimore or Philadelphia . Hence they are no justification for demanding an ex-Lake differential on Canadian grain . Canada called Boston territory . Surely there must be some territory , outside of New England , for which Boston may compete on equal terms . The port , as often as it appears in a Differential Case , is warned off differential territory . In his 1912 decision , Commissioner Clark , on pages 65 , 66 and 68 , reminds Boston of the disadvantage from which it suffers in having no trunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // to explain Boston 's small proportion of Lake-and-rail export flour : It would appear that this tonnage moved in quite equal volume to the ports of New York , Philadelphia and Baltimore . Obviously it would require some unusual condition or strong inducement to attract this business to Boston , especially in view of the fact that the main trunk lines reaching Baltimore and Philadelphia and New York have their own boat lines on the Lakes . On page 63 he states : It is urged that the all-rail differentials applying at Baltimore and Philadelphia , which are greater than the ex-Lake differentials , give Philadelphia and Baltimore a practical monopoly of the all-rail export grain as against Boston . It is to be noted , however , that substantially all of the all-rail export grain reaching Philadelphia or Baltimore is transported from points of origin or primary markets over the Pennsylvania or Baltimore &; Ohio systems , neither of which reaches Boston . On page 66 he implies that Canada is the territory in which Boston may have an interest . Every road desires to get the longest possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Boston &; Maine , the Grand Trunk and the Canadian Pacific naturally prefer to see the traffic moving through Boston . In the docket of the 1912 Case , page 1712 , Mr. Charles Wight , Freight Traffic Manager of the Baltimore &; Ohio , stated : Boston has a large territory , the New England territory as well as the Canadian territory , from which to draw , and should be satisfied therewith . // Boston has right to equal rates on Canadian traffic . Baltimore and Philadelphia have expressed surprise that Boston should ask equal export rates with them on steel from Pittsburgh , which they wish to regard as local territory . They should not be surprised to see Boston demand merely equal rates with them on traffic from territory which they admit is Boston 's own . If the ex-Lake rates on American grain are made to be in accord with American all-rail differ-entials , ought not the ex-Lake rates on Canadian grain accord with a Canadian all-rail export structure of equality to all ports ? How Canadian wheat is flowing through Baltimore . The real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the volume of Canadian wheat exports swells . In the 1911-1912 Hearings , Mr. Jack-son , a Baltimore grain exporter , testified as follows , speaking to the Boston counsel : There are four steamers to load from Baltimore in a few days with Canadian ex-Lake wheat , on which the differentials are so small that it could easily have been exported via Boston if the Boston exporters had been enterprising . Apparently the movement of Canadian wheat through Baltimore is a regular one , such as to attract steamship lines that operate through the entire year . The following is significant in the Report of the Baltimore Chamber of Commerce for the year 1912 , pages X-XII : Western hard winter wheats have moved through here freely for export and Canadian wheat has furnished over 68% of our exports , as there was an ample supply and a good demand for it in the spring and also in the late autumn . // Repeated efforts on our part with managers of various steamship lines have resulted in assurances of im-proved service from here in the near future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , as large quantities of Canadian grain will have to seek an outlet through Atlantic ports , even when our home crops are small , more frequent sailings will probably be arranged for than we have had in the past few years . Canadian wheat through United States Ports . The manner in which Baltimore and Philadelphia have gained upon Boston in the handling of Canadian wheat for export is shown in the following table : The case of Boston and New York . Canada is going the way of the Middle West ? to the differential ports . If action is to be taken , now is the time to take it . Boston and New York have ground for complaint before the Interstate Commerce Commission that they are being discriminated against in the matter of // differential Lake-and-rail export rates on Canadian flour from Fort William and Port Arthur , via Buffalo . They have cause for complaint of discrimination in the matter of ex-Lake grain rates from Buffalo on Canadian grain for export . The two ports should proceed jointly in the matter and claim that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to correspond to the general Buffalo export rate structure . Buffalo versus Erie and Fairport . The ex-Lake grain rates are the important matter . In regard to them , there are three difficulties to be met with . First , the differential must be abolished for all lower Lake ports . The Pennsylvania has a Lake port and elevators at Erie , Pa. , just west of the differential line . The Baltimore &; Ohio has an elevator at Fairport , Ohio . It and the Pennsylvania might claim that they had a right to take a differential on ex-Lake grain shipped from these ports in differential territory , even if the Commission were to equalize the ex-Lake rates from Buffalo to all ports . But the claim of Baltimore and Philadelphia has always rested on the origin of the traffic in question . If the origin , not the Lake port , is determining when differential traffic passes through a neutral port ( Buffalo ) ; then origin , not Lake port , must be determining when neutral ( Canadian ) traffic passes through a differential port . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1905 decision fixing ex-Lake rates . On page 75 of that decision , Commissioner Prouty says : This traffic may move through either Erie , Fairport or Buffalo . Fairport and Erie are in differential territory , so that rates from these points would be , upon the ordinary // basis , lower to Philadelphia and Baltimore than to New York . But it was said in testimony that with respect to this ex-Lake grain these three ports should be treated alike ; and such is our opinion . To apply a lower rate to Fairport or Erie would be unjust to Buffalo . The three ports will remain together . If the Commission prescribed equal ex-Lake rates on Canadian wheat from Buffalo , on the ground of neutrality of territory from which the traffic came , it is not likely that the Pennsylvania and the Baltimore &; Ohio would plead a technicality to justify them in starting a rate war to put Erie and Fairport on a different basis from Buffalo ; especially in these days when the railroads plead depleted revenues from unremunerative rates . Distinguishing between United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is : If Canadian wheat is admitted free into this country , will it be possible to distinguish between Canadian and American wheat ? It should be possible , for Canadian and American wheat are of different grades , the Canadian grades being higher and better . In the case of Canadian grain via Duluth there is some mixing with the American product . But most of the Canadian grain via Fort William and Port Arthur reaches the seaboard with its " identity preserved . " Hence it should not be difficult for the roads to ascertain whether the wheat is Canadian and could properly claim the Baltimore ex-Lake rate to Boston , or whether it is American and must pay 0.3 ? per bushel higher . Support of Boston roads . Finally , could the support of the Boston railroads be counted on ? In the last Differential Case they joined the Boston Chamber of Commerce in an attempt to gain an equalization // with Baltimore of all export rates , including those on ex-Lake grain . There is no reason to suppose that they feel differently now . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a freight port ; it is small compensation to them that it is rapidly developing as a transatlantic passenger port . In a very important item of traffic , and one that soon will be the most important one , Boston 's roads would have the equality with southern ports which they have sought . Earnings of the Boston railroads from the proposed reduced ex-Lake rates would be larger than they are at present on all-rail grain from the West . At present , for instance , the Baltimore rate on ex-Lake wheat is 5.2 ? , of which 0.5 ? is given to the Buffalo elevator , leaving 4.7 ? to prorate among the carriers east of Buffalo . The rate from Chicago on all-rail wheat is 13 ? per 100 pounds , 7.8 ? per bushel . Of this the carriers west of Buffalo get 48% , or 3.744 ? , leaving only 4.056 ? to be divided among the carriers east of Buffalo . To win tire case would solve Boston 's problem . If Boston can present arni win the case outlined , involving ex-Lake export @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is solved . It will load out of here the scores of tramps which must annually go to the differential or cotton ports seeking out-cargo . It will see its European services doubled in five years . It will supply liners with the cargo they seek and at inland rates such that they need make no sacrifice in ocean rates in order to bring traffic through Boston . On every 100,000 bushels of ex-Lake Canadian wheat the steamships took through Boston they could earn $300 more than at present . ( 100,000 x 0.30 . ) The foundation will be laid for the reconstruction of the Boston // export grain trade . It will be possible to do what a leader of the New York grain trade characterized as Boston 's need : " to colonize grain merchants in Boston . " Boston 's grain exporters , except one , did not disappear willingly ; it was because the old nominal differential rates on western grain hardened and were observed as real differentials , which cut the exporters off from the full-cargo business and handicapped them in the liner business at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these obstacles to handling through Boston the grain of the future . Summary . The outlines of the history of differential rates have been traced . It has been seen that they are of from thirty to thirty-five years standing , and are based on : 1 . The greater nearness of Baltimore and Philadelphia to the leading points in the Middle West ; 2 . The desire to distribute the exports of this Middle West and so keep all ports " in business . " In this latter connection it was felt that Baltimore and Philadelphia had an ocean disability which needed a rail advantage to compensate it . Much agitation and three legal attempts to break the differentials and institute equal rates to all North Atlantic ports , have been successful only in bringing about modifications in them ; namely , on flour , all-rail grain and steel . There is not much hope that the differential rate structure on American traffic will be changed , except possibly in the matter of more individual modifications . In the last differential case it was seen that Boston had the unexpected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West advanced to the New York level . As ocean rates on imports are the same // to all outports , the effect of this decision is to make the through rates lower via the other outports , Boston being marooned between Baltimore on the South and Portland , St. John and Montreal on the North ? all with Baltimore import rates , 3 ? under Boston . Boston 's chance of developing its volume of imports for the West is not good . However , statistics show that the development of New England can be counted on to provide inward cargo for ships ; there are now more ships brought to Boston than can be loaded out . For years the bulk of Boston 's imports have been for New England . The import rate decision was a blow to the Boston railroads rather than to the port . The latter has an export rather than an import problem . New England does not and can not supply the bulky freight necessary to fill ships . Regions outside New England must be drawn on for export cargo . Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect . Full cargo business is impossible via Boston . Liners are subsidized to take their out-cargo at differential ports for they can there earn on it an additional sum , over the Boston rates , equal to at least part of the differential . Most of the Boston services belong to great steamship companies with parallel services out of differential ports . In some cases liners , which bring to Boston imports for New England , proceed to differential ports to take their western out-cargo . When outward services are run from Boston , it is at the sacrifice , in the ocean rates , of part or a whole of the inland differential ? of the whole differential in the case of flour , for instance . As an offset to the effect of the freight differentials in decreasing the freight earnings , it was recommended // that the strongest effort be made to better the passenger earnings of Boston steamship lines . As a passenger port , Boston has peculiar advantages . It was suggested that an advertising campaign in the West be employed to induce a larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The present attractions of the port will continue to increase its popularity for third-class travel . It was stated that even when the Boston ocean lines shrink their ocean rates and equalize the differential , it is more difficult to fill the Boston boats with western cargo than those at the other out-ports . This is because of the total lack of Boston representation in the West , to educate and solicit the shippers for Boston . It was suggested that a second offset to the effect of the differential would be through a strengthening of distinct Boston representation in the West . To carry on the work of educating western and other shippers to use this gateway , and when possible Department would perform the larger function of aiding the Port Directors to formulate and pursue a consistent traffic policy to meet the traffic problem which confronts them . Each of the three Boston roads should at least put an Export Agent in Chicago . The Boston steamship lines have a right to this in view of the western solicitation which the roads serving all other ports give to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was seen that these offsets would only mitigate and not solve the problem . The problem is to find traffic on which the steamships can earn as // much out of Boston as out of other ports ; that is , traffic on which there is no rail differential against Boston . Three traffic sources were described as being properly in this category ; namely , New England , Buffalo and Canada . New England could not help much even if all its exports could be forced through Boston . It does not produce the tonnage . Buffalo , with equal export rates to all ports , is in position to help a great deal , and will do so as it develops its output of American grain products . The especial attention of the railroads and the Port Directors ' Traffic Department should be given to Buffalo . But Canada is the export traffic field of the future . The United States is having a smaller and smaller surplus of grain for export ; its export of flour is decreasing . The causes producing this will continue . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States foodstuffs abroad ; they will decline as it disappears . Those of them will prosper which are in shape to carry the substitute for this declining American movement ; that is , Canadian wheat and flour . It was shown that a larger and larger volume of Canadian exports of breadstuffs overflows , and is bound to overflow , to the American ports . In the matter of western Canadian flour moving Lake-and-rail for export , it was seen that Boston is subjected to a discrimination , in that the United States differentials are applied to this traffic , though it neither originates in differential territory nor passes through it . The weight of this discrimination will increase with the growing concentration of export milling west of the Lakes . Boston gets a considerable tonnage of Canadian flour milled east of Georgian Bay . On this flour there are as low rates to Boston // as to any other American port . Boston gets a good share of Canadian flour exported in bond , second to New York , but that is to be expected in view of the wider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter of ex-Lake export differentials on Canadian grain that the severest discrimination against Boston lies , and one that threatens the port 's future . Buffalo 's local export rates to all ports , Boston to Baltimore inclusive , are the same . Ex-Lake grain is a local movement . A special justification is required to uphold a differential on this grain . It was shown that the ex-Lake rates on American grain are , in the eyes of Baltimore and Philadelphia and the Commission , based on the all-rail differentials , which are an expression of the greater nearness of the southern ports to the Middle West . A purpose of the all-rail differentials being to distribute the export traffic of this Middle West to the various ports , the ex-Lake rates are shaped to supplement the all-rail rates . It was proven that ex-Lake differentials on Canadian grain existed before any all-rail differentials and so are not based on them . It was shown that the allrail rates to all United States ports from Baltimore north have been the same ; namely , 23 ? per 100 pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Canadian West grew faster than the all-rail lines of the three Canadian transcontinentals could be built east of Lake Superior ? this fact caused the Canadian wheat export to overflow all-rail via Minneapolis and Duluth , thence to Chicago , where it accidentally ran into the American differential rate structure . The fact that Canadian grain has been temporarily // forced into a channel with a differential designed to protect Baltimore and Philadelphia in the Middle West , is no reason for a differential on Buffalo ex-Lake grain from Canada that does not touch differential territory at all . There seem to be no serious difficulties to the application of equal ex-Lake export rates on Canadian grain while the ex-Lake differential remains on American grain . It was recommended that Boston and New York enter a formal complaint before the Interstate Commerce Commission charging that the present ex-Lake export differentials on Canadian grain are discriminatory against the two northern ports , as are the Lake-and-rail export rates on flour from Fort William and Port Arthur . It was shown that , as the result of these differentials on Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they did the Middle West . The statistics show Baltimore and Philadelphia overhauling Boston in the export of Canadian wheat . Canada was shown to be recognized as Boston territory . Therefore , no just opposition can be made to the claim that equal rates to all ports on ex-Lake wheat from this territory shall prevail , in conformity with other Buffalo export rates . Success in this case was represented as being substantially a solution of Boston 's port problem . D THE COASTWISE TRAFFIC SITUATION CHAPTER XII A LINE TO THE PACIFIC COAST Cheapness of water transportation . Roadbed . There are three fundamental advantages of coastwise water transportation over land transportation . It is cheaper because the water route has no expenditures for purchase , construction or maintenance of roadbed . The fixed charges for these items are responsible for a good percentage of the railroad rate that must be charged to bring a fair return on the investment in the road . The water route is over a natural highway ; it need only get a pier at either end of its line and its physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The waterway needs maintenance only at its terminals and this is provided by the United States Government . Operation . Operation is similarly cheaper on the water . For reasons having to do with comparative resistances , a given horse power in a boat propels a larger tonnage through the water than the same horse power in a locomotive can pull even over level rails . Everyone knows that rails are not level and that the heaviest grade limits the tonnage an engine can pull . There are no grades on the water , and no curves . Finally , the water route is quicker . Its freight moves over a roadbed of indefinite capacity and is halted by passing through no intermediate terminals . Limitation . Need of full cargo . There are two // leading limitations to the utilization of the principle of cheaper coastwise transportation . In the first place , the boat must be filled . Its size and operating cost are fixed and the same whether 5 or 5,000 tons are carried ; the boat services of regular lines are all scheduled and must run as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be left behind as the tonnage of a freight train can be reduced , or trains taken off , to meet the varying demands of trade . The boat can not be filled with port-to-port business ; most of its cargo must be from and to interior points beyond its water termini . The co-operation of the railroads must be had in collecting and distributing , in supplying the full cargoes . This alone will enable the individual trips of the boat line to pay , and enable the line to make frequent enough sailings so that it can be a real competitor of the all-rail route , in service . High terminal handling costs . This preponderance of rail-and-water shipments over pure port-to-port shipments is at the basis of the second limitation . Such traffic over the combined rail-and-water route is subject to four handlings : a loading into the car by the shipper , a transhipment into the boat by the water carrier , later a transhipment into the car by the water carrier , finally an unloading from the car by the consignee . If the car had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , undertaken by the shipper and the consignee . The part-water route is subject to two extra handlings at the ports , and expensive ones . ' They are really double handlings , // from the one carrier and to the other . It costs about twice as much to stow and unstow freight to and from a vessel 's hold as to handle it between a car and a platform flush with the door of the car . Advantage increases with length of route . The effect of this second condition is that the principal cost of water routes or land-and-water routes is in the handling of freight at the water termini , and is far larger than the freight handling costs of the all-rail route between the same points . ' If the water route is long enough , or the water portion of the land-and-water route is long enough , the greater cheapness per mile of water carriage can out-weigh the cheaper terminal handling costs of the rail route . That is , for short distances , rail is cheaper than water trans-portation , especially land-and-water transportation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both in rates and service , increases with the length of the water haul . Importance of coastwise routes to New England . The coastwise services occupy a place of peculiar importance in New England 's transportation system . This section is removed from the consuming center of the country in the Middle West , and from the rapidly growing markets in the Southwest and the Pacific Coast . This greater distance means a disadvantage with respect to the time in which New England freight can be delivered to the markets in question ; moreover , rail rates from distant New England are bound to be // higher than from near-by producers in the Middle West . Distance controlling in all-rail rates . For many years distance has largely been ignored in the making of rail tariffs . The principle has been to see that all producers are " kept in business " in all markets . Today the tendency is more and more to regard distance and penalize the distant producer . This tendency is encouraged and enforced by the Interstate Commerce Commission . It was this consideration of distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West up to the level of New York 's , where they had never been before . With rail-and-water rates the case is different . These rates put New England 's products in Atlanta and Montgomery and Texas cheaper than the products of Chicago , though Chicago is far nearer to these markets all-rail . In the same way all-water lines to the Pacific Coast will deliver New England products more cheaply than they can be carried from the Middle West by the transcontinentals . The railroads and the Interstate Commerce Commission recognize the inherent cheapness of coastwise transportation . They recognize the inherent right of communities , which can use the coastwise carriers , to have cheap rates to markets which the boats can help them reach . New England is heavily indebted to the coastwise lines for its present markets ; its future markets will depend still more upon the maintenance and extension of these coastwise services and the rate structures which they represent . Present coastwise services . The operating difficulties under which the coastwise lines labor , in their present Atlantic Avenue situation , will soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent coastwise connections with all ports from Halifax to Jacksonville . The frequency of these connections ( major lines only ) is as follows : Needs for the future . The principal needs of Boston , to complete its coastwise services , are a line to the Pacific Coast , as soon as the Panama Canal is opened , and , perhaps later , a line to Galveston , to serve Texas . The Pacific Coast . Old transcontinental rates . It is expected that the Panama Canal will result in a strengthening of the ability of Eastern Seaboard Territory to compete in the markets of the Pacific Coast . Years ago the all-rail rate from the eastern coast cities to the Pacific seaboard was lower than the rate to the same destination from the Middle West , on the ground that the coast-to-coast shipments were subject to the competition of water carriers via Cape Horn or via the Isthmus of Panama , while shipments from the Middle West were not . The rail rate to the western coast from the Mississippi Valley was higher // than from the eastern coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valley to the Atlantic seaboard . Similarly , the rail rate from the Atlantic seaboard to San Francisco and other ports was low because subject to , the water competition mentioned . The rail rate from the eastern coast to an inland western point like Reno was higher than the rail rate to San Francisco by the amount of the rate from San Francisco to Reno . This latter condition still exists ; that is , transcontinental rates in both directions are lower for San Francisco than Reno and other interior coast cities . Middle West equalized with seaboard . But in the eastern half of the country conditions have changed . The low transcontinental rates between the Atlantic and Pacific seaboards were extended to apply between the Pacific seaboard and all points on or east of the Missouri River . That is , all territory east of the Missouri was " blanketed " for this transcontinental traffic , in both directions . The so-called " transcontinental " roads end at the Missouri or Mississippi river , or at Chicago . They had not liked a rate policy which had tended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coast . When that traffic originated in the East the eastern trunk lines took 25% for hauling it to Chicago , 33%. for hauling it to Omaha . The " transcontinentals " were much better pleased to see the traffic originate at Chicago , St. Louis , St. Paul or Omaha , which gave these roads 100% of the rate . If a manufacturing population concentrated in the East consumed Pacific Coast fruits , the eastern lines again had to be paid 25% or 33% of the rate for delivering the cars carrying this traffic . The transcontinentals could far better afford to deliver // the cars for the same rate to a manufacturing popu-lation in Omaha or Chicago , retaining the whole 100% of the rate . Middle West gets better rates than seaboard . The first step , therefore , towards building up the Middle West was to " blanket " it with the East in the matter of transcontinental rates , in both directions . The second step went farther than this . Class rates in both directions were graded by zones that run east-ward from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher the rate . ' Most commodity tariffs eastbound were similarly graded . Westbound class tariffs were graded by zones of origin ; the westbound commodity tariffs are sometimes graded , sometimes blanketed for the whole territory east of the Missouri River . Advantage of Canal to Atlantic seaboard . The rate advantages thus given the Middle West , in trans-continental traffic , are accompanied by advantages it enjoys in point of service . Traffic from the eastern seaboard , particularly New England , must move through intermediate gateways before getting into the through trains of the transcontinental railroads . This means some delay compared with shipments from a middle western point , probably located at a terminal of a transcontinental . ' The Panama Canal promises
