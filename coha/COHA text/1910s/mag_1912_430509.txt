 | Human experience has never given hearty approval to the theory that conversation should be of things and not of people , for it has found that the practice of gossiping is a decidedly pleasant way of spending the hours of recreation , and that it is an unimproved agent for mental sanitation . He is generally a churl who rejoices not in the recital of personalities , in the exposition of those trivial characteristics of his neighbor which mark him an individual and seal his brotherhood with the rest of them that stand in the following of Adam . One has said that it would be profitable to investigate the appearance in the same literary generation of Pepys , Aubrey , Evelyn , Howell , Anthony a Wood and Thomas Fuller , those masters of the art of gossiping . This would indeed be an opportunity for much curious speculation , perchance for a war waged by thesis and dissertation . The reason for the lasting popularity of this group of Restorationists , is , however , more easily determined , for it is precisely because these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others than the antiquarian . It is because Fuller " rejected nothing as too mean for remembrance " that his books are warm with handling while the dusty volumes of more exact historians , better sermon writers , and more learned commentators remain untouched upon the upper shelves of a thou sand libraries . The Reverend Thomas Fuller , D. D. , stock-father and very image of the perfect priest and Christian gentleman , was born in the year 1608 of an ecclesiastical family , in the rectory of a Northamptonshire village . The lad Fuller was so precocious in the acquirement of learning that he received his bachelor 's degree from Cambridge in his sixteenth year , and in seven more years he had become Master of Arts , Fellow Commoner of Sidney Sussex College , and Prebendary of Salisbury Cathedral . After nearly a decade spent as rector ofaDorsetshire parish , he went in the year 1641 to London , where there awaited him a short but successful ministry as preacher of the historic Savoy Chapel . During the Civil War , as became a good Churchman , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lectureship in London and his prebendal stall by his  | page deleted  | hundred years to the pronouncement that " Fuller was incomparbly the most sensible , the least prejudiced great man of an age that boasted a galaxy of great men " . The full story of his active , sometimes dramatic , life may be read in any one of the several good biographies which have been written of him . By his own confession , Fuller was the greatest offender of his time in adding to what he calls the " numerosity of needless books " , but all of his thirty or more separate publications partake of the excellencies of style and matter which have made a few of them great . As he would have phrased it , the majority of them are less considered only because their subjects are less considerable . The principal ones of his writings are the Church History of Britain , the History of the Worthies of England , the Holy and Profane State , Good Thoughts in Bad Times , the History of the Holy War , a Pisgah Sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Innocence . The ecclesiastic says that of these the " Chuch History " is the greatest , and because it is made great and enjoyable by the same qualities that " entertain the reader with delight " in the " Worthies " , I for one shall not quarrel with the point of view that gives a second place to the secular history . Next to his mother , the Church , Thomas Fuller acknowledged allegiance to the King , and at the beginning of the Civil War so vigorous were his utterances on matters political that London became uncomfortable for him , and the royal camp at Oxford was enriched by one more whose conscience would allow no compromise between duty and interest . This recruit showed by enlisting as chaplain to the forces under Lord Hopton that his was more than pen-loyalty and lip-service . It is to the years of service that followed in the royal army that the world owes his book on the " Worthies of England " . During the course of several long campaigns within a small area , an army covers the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places that lie far from the coach road . Where went Lord Hopton 's force , there followed its chaplain , who , note book in hand , kept eye and ear alert for any indication of a curious fact , a significant date , or an interesting name or event which might appropriately find a place in the pages of his " darling project " , the history of the worthies of England . His contemporary biographer says that he made a sort of  | errantry of his search for those elusive fragments of information which are the soul food of the antiquarian , hastening from manorhouse to churchyard or vestry room , interviewing parish clerks , sextons or any aged persons who would be likely to know new things about old persons and places , enduring good-naturedlythe garrulity of grave diggers , and the peevishness of those church officers who demurred at bringing forth the parish records , a task which is notoriously distasteful to the keepers of these treasuries of past events and long forgotten names and dates . It was in this way , by every physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kindliness that the material for his book was brought together . As the national drama which was to end in front of Whitehall Palace drew towards its close , he had his unwieldy collection of facts systematized and the writing of his narrative well begun . Upon the execution of Charles , however , we find him brought to a stand . " What shall I write " , he asked sadly , " of the worthies of England , when this horrid act will bring such infamy upon the whole nation , as will ever cloud and darken all its former , and suppress all its future , rising glories " ? Before a year had gone , however , he was once more busy upon the correlation of his notes and references , and this time there was to be no interruption until that day twelve years later when , although physically ill , he insisted upon preaching , saying that often he had gone up into the pulpit sick in body , but had come down through God 's grace a well man . But this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good man Fuller was taken to his fathers , good men too . The History of the Worthies of England , endeavored by Thomas Fuller , D. D. , published in 1662 , had , we learn , five reasons for being . " Know then " , its author writes , " I propound five ends to myself in this Book ; first , to gain some glory to God ; secondly , to preserve the memories of the dead ; thirdly , to present examples to the living ; fourthly , to entertain the reader with delight ; and lastly ( which I am not ashamed publicly to profess ) , to procure some honest profit to myself . " The honest profit went to that " hopeful plant at Cambridge " , his son , who upon Fuller 's death was under the necessity of seeing the work through the press , but the other proposals of the author were made good to the letter .  | Generally it happens , with small loss to the reader , that the introduction of a book receives curt attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Worthies " he would be leaving out the sauce from his pudding , for since the beginning of books there has been no piece of writing indicative to a greater degree of a wise judgment , a well stored memory , a kind heart , and a surpassing literary skill than the chapters which Thomas Fuller prefixed to his great work . From this generalization , I do not except even " Democritus to the Reader " , and for my heresy I cry forgiveness of the lovers of Master Burton 's excellent " Anatomy of Melancholy . " Fuller 's introduction acquaints the reader with the " design of the ensuing work " and it contrives in some way to make known to him that honest , quizzical gentleman , its author . By an unusual gift of ingratiation , Fuller attracts to himself from the outset the sympathy of the reader , and that gained , affection for him is a sure consequence . He declares the plan of the " Worthies " to be a consideration of each of the counties of England with the view of setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufactures , buildings , wonders , proverbs , physical characteristics and memorable persons , a task much like that which the writer of a guide book sets himself . The difference is that Fuller is a great writer who enlivens a workaday subject by genial humor , and adds color to its grayness by the play of his fancy . One reading between the lines of the introduction sees that the writer assumes with zest the character of showman of legended castles , monasteries and churches , and that it is pleasant to him to be the herald of princes , popes , cardinals , great political lords , high sheriffs , judges , writers , philanthropists , soldiers , seamen and holders of a variety of offices and practisers of a score of arts and crafts . One of the chief sources for the writer on English history and antiquities is this inspired guide book of the England of Charles the Second . It is more , however , than a mine of information for the hungry writer of history , for because there shines through its pages the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most intimately beloved of the works of English writers . Anthony a Wood collected with unceasing diligence and collated with notable erudition that vast store of biographical and antiquarian data which  | makes him even today the first and last resource of the student of English history , but through the centuries he has come to us on all men 's tongues as " dull Anthony a Wood " , and by no use of rhetoric on the part of his admirers can he be made to appear undeserving of the adjeftive . He lacked the " incommunicable grace " of thought and expression which has made Fuller 's book one of superlative richness for any reader who has an eye for color , an ear for delicate and ingenious phrasing , sympathy for the whimsical and the trivial in the lives of men and appreciation of their praiseworthy deeds and their greatness . A great critic has said that one in three of Fuller 's sentences deserves to be quoted as a maxim . This was only an emphatic way of saying that of all English writing , none is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of epigram , simile , metaphor , antithesis or alliteration . I shall cite two or three sentences here to show as well as may be done his dexterity as a phrase maker , and when I sav that passages equally noteworthy in this respect occur on every page of his books , I do not overstate his skill in the art of expression . I remember Fuller 's chapter devoted in a general way to English music and musicians by its shortest paragraph , the gist of which is in this sentence : " I confess " , he writes , " there is a company of pretenders fo music , . . . . but these are no more a disgrace to the true professors of that faculty than monkeys are a disparagement to mankind " . Son of one clergyman , father of another and nephew of two bishops , Fuller is under obligation to refute that age old banality , concerning the invariable depravity of clergymen 's children . He does this in a virile piece of advocacy which takes up nearly three printed pages , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristic of his writing . " In a word " , he contends , " other men 's children would have as many eyesores , if they had as many eyes seeing them " . In his introduction , he precludes the possibility of adverse criticism by setting up and answering certain " exceptions to the style and matter of the author " . When an imaginary critic chides him for the omission from his book of maps and portraits , he gives several satisfactory reasons for their absence , concluding as follows : " Such new regraving them would be injurious to the  | owners of the old maps ; and I will not bottom my profit on another man 's prejudice " . Here are one or two shorter phrases of the sort that abound throughout the " Worthies " . Rosamund he describes as the " mistresspiece of beauty of that age " . Of a certain handsome prelate he writes that " the inn of his soul had a fair sign " ; and he says that by the excellent Latinity of Thomas Linacre , " Galen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek in the original " . It is not easy to say which of the many things it is that appeals most strongly to readers of Fuller . In a chapter on the " often altering of surnames , and the various writings thereof " , he concludes his dissertation with these words , " and however such diversity appeareth in the eyes of others , I dare profess that I am delighted with the prospect thereof " . Sometimes I think that next to that quality of style which the world has agreed to describe as " quaint " , it is this charafteristic of Fuller 's mind , this dislike for vapid uniformity in men and things , which charms his readers into paying continued homage to his genius . That is a broad sympathy which records in the " Worthies " the main fasts in the life of William Shakespeare , the master mind , and the wondrous feat of John Bray , who was so strong " that he carried upon his back , about the year 1608 , at onetime by the space well near of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckoning fifteen gallons to the bushel ; and upon them all the miller , a lubber of four and twenty years of age " . And it is a comprehensive mind that could set down in a serious history the deed of one surnamed Kiltour , who lay on his back in Launceston gaol and " threw a stone of some pounds ' weight over the tower 's top ( and that I assure you is no low one ) " . Charles Lamb was of the company of readers and writers whom Fuller has held in pleasant thralldom . He complains in one of his letters that his eyesight is nearly burned out by three days of reading in the closely printed folios , in which for many years the works of our author remained . He published from his commonplace book , with all too few notes , what extracts he found there from the various works of the Carolinian parson , and the passage which most excited his enthusiasm was this which I append , leaving the reader to judge of what he calls the " fine imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | it . The following paragraphs occur in the section devoted to the " memorable persons of Bedfordshire . " " Henry de Essex. ? He is too well known in our English chronicles , being Baron of Raleigh in Essex , and hereditary standardbearer of England . It happened in the reign of this king , ( Henry II ) there was a fierce battle fought in Flintshire , at Coleshull , betwixt the English and Welsh , wherein this Henry de Essex , . . . ( " betwixt traitor and coward cast away both his courage and banner together , " ) occasioning a great overthrow of the English . " But he that had the baseness to do , had the boldness to deny the doing of , so foul a fact ; until he was challenged in combat by Robert de Momford , a knight , eye-witness thereof , and by him overcome in a duel ; whereupon his large inheritance was confiscated to the king , and he himself , partly thrust , partly going into a convent , hid his head in a cowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blushed out the remainder of his life . " Probably the most valuable of the memorials of great men which Fuller has preserved in the " Worthies " is that sketch of Shakespeare , which , short as it is , yet seems to be one of the two or three straws which the Baconian can not pass without fetching a smart tumble . He admired the great dramatist unfeignedly , but it is amusing to find him free of the bondage to the name to which our age is subject . He loses no opportunity throughout his works to rate Shakespeare soundly for making Sir John Fastolfe , a worthy and courageous gentleman , the prototype of Sir John Falstaff , a " thrasonical puff and emblem of mock valour " , thus perverting the name and reputation of an honest knight into an " anvil for every dull wit to strike upon " . It is the fashion of an age justly weary of artificiality in life and letters to depreciate the mere stylist , but even if Fuller were no more than this , it would still be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he shows himself the master of every rhetorical use known of the grammarians . In description , narration , exposition and argument , he calls into service every figure of diction and figure of thought which rhetoric allows . He was free of that great vice of the Elizabethan and Stuart prose writer , the unreasoning use of certain forms of expression and figures of speech whereby writing was made inelastic and thought obscure and tenuous , yet in the constant employment of figurative language he outdid most of his contem- page deleted
