WHAT took place I can only guess at . for the courteous guide furnished by the Ministry of Education spoke English most tentatively . As for me , I knew just enough Japanese to enable me to lose my way in the , picturesque Seoul , streets , and not a single word of Korean . So if I tell this story vaguely , the confusion of tongues is to blame . it was in the Loyalty Room of a Japanese school in Korea . A large Tight room , with a dais on which stood the state chairs of Emperor and Empress , and on the walls emblems , pictures , and edifying diagrams . One diagram I remember particularly . It was a sort of statistical chart , with painted oblongs , suppo:zd to represent the duration of various dynasties ? Japanese , Chinese , British , French . The Japanese was much the longest , twenty-five inches , each inch representing a hundred years of uninterrupted rule . It caught the lesson that the divine ancestors of the divine Mikado had ruled over Japan long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that his descendants would doubtless continue to rule after these feverish peoples had forever disappeared . The United States , with its meager one hundred and forty years of independence , was represented by an oblong only an inch and a half high . " Ours is the baby nation , " I hazarded . My polite interpreter smiled , in the meanwhile sucking in his breath as the Japanese do when they wish to show deference . " Yes , " he replied , " but a very big baby . " What struck me in this Loyalty Room was the sedulous care with which these patient Japanese masters seek to indoctrinate the Koreans , whose unquiet independence they have abolished and whom they now wish to transform into patriotic Nipponese . To this purpose nothing , I imagine , could be better adapted than schools . I visited several of these and found them not badly directed , though few in number . They could not compare with the truly magnificent schools established by Americans in the Philippines , but they were better than nothing and better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both Japanese and Korean , maintained good discipline , and the methods of instruction seemed not inadequate . Unfortunately , most of these schools served Japanese residents of Korea rather than native Koreans , and even schools for the latter seemed to be taken up far too much with the inculcation of loyalty and subservience rather than with a preparation for the tasks of life . It is , of course , natural that Japan , having so recently absorbed Korea , should try by one means or another to conquer the wills and secure the adhe-sion of the natives . For Japan every-thing depends on Korea . The Korean peninsula lies nearest to Japan ; it is like a dagger pointed at Japan 's heart . It was through Korea that Japan first into into contact with the old culture of China . It was Korea that the hardy islanders , over two hundred years ago , overran and sought to conquer . For the mastery of Korea , Japan fought two great and victorious wars against China and Russia . Thereafter , Japan assumed a protectorate in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put an end to that independence . To-day Japan rules as absolutely in Korea as does Great Britain in Malta . KOREA ? AN EXPERIMENT IN DENATIONALIZATION 393 To lose Korea is to lose Japan 's causeway to Asia , to surrender all dominion over the continent , to sink again to the status of a small island power . If , on the other hand , the Koreans can be converted into loyal Nipponese , Japan will have straddled the sea and will have one foot planted firmly on the mainland . How is one to gain the loyalty of such a subject people . or , indeed , is such a thing at all possible ? Japan is trying in many ways , by repression , by education , by a show of force , by a display of superiority , by good works , by promises . A few days after I arrived in Korea I saw this steady Japanese propaganda proceeding in the criminal courts . Seated behind the judges ' bench , I was present when various petty criminals were tried by due process of law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and various small offenses . The scales of justice , I was told , were held rigidly even , and no favoritism was shown to rich or poor , yang-ban or tattered beggar , Japanese or Korean . For centuries the Korean had found nothing but venality and oppression in his courts of law . Surely , I thought , this even-handed , open-minded Japan-ese justice must reconcile Koreans to the loss of their old insecure liberties . At that moment they brought in a big , tight-muscled Korean accused of murder . The prisoner , meek , dumb , ox-like , stood there , listening uncomprehendingly to the reading of a document first in his own language and then in that of the judges . It appeared that a Japanese had come to the Korean 's house for some reason , good or bad ; I could not discover which , for the Korean spoke his own language , the official interpreter made it over into Japanese , and my own interpreter ( who was more interested in gaining than imparting knowledge ) translated it intermittently into scraps of English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese had been slain . Under such circumstances any trial might have seemed tame . After a long while nothing happened , except that I was urbanely conducted to an adjoining room , where the judges soon joined , me . I was never able to learn the ultimate fate of the Korean . I felt sure , however , that he was doomed . He , too , knew it . There had been that in his stolid expression as he looked into the faces of his alien judges that showed he had no hope . For justice must be done and Japanese supremacy maintained . After the trial I took morning tea with the judges . I liked them somewhat better off the bench , though there still clung to them an elusive , bureaucratic odor . These men were intelligent and faithful administrators , of the French rather than the British or American type . They asked me questions , which I answered confidently , concerning juvenile courts in America , and then they spoke soberly about the administration of justice in Korea . They said , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese came did the poor man of Korea understand that he had any rights in the courts . They told me of the improving administration , the temperingl of justice with clemency , the wise moderation of the judges . Yet , while they spoke , what I really thought of was the dumb prisoner who had killed the Japanese . I wondered whether by any chance the courts would he clement in his case . I wondered what in his stupid way he thought , and what his neighbors thought , of Japanese rule in Korea . One thing is certain : the Koreans are not at ease with their island conquerors . I went on an excursion into the country with an intelligent and subtle Japanese journalist . We arrived at a piggledy village , consisting of one street of thatched mud huts , sunning themselves in the leisurely afternoon . We called on the head official , the maire of the village . To my surprise , he was intimidated by our visit . ( Our rare automobile was in itself awe-inspiring . ) He knew no single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend knew no Korean , they conversed together with pencil and paper , for the Korean and Japanese languages have the same ideographs , the same characters for the same ideas , though the words are totally different . So the two men , one in the dark Japanese garb and the other in the white , flowing Korean robe , mutely talked in writing , like deaf and dumb men , leaning all the while over the wooden counter of the little mairie that looked for all the world like a land-surveyor 's office in a lazy Southern village , or like a little grocery-shop bereft of its groceries . At last we left amid mutual obeisances , but the tall Korean bowed lower than the Japanese , and he still looked at us with pathetic , frightened eyes and seemed relieved as we . moved out of the door to the waiting automobile . I had asked my journalist friend to inquire of the Korean how many Japanese lived in this village . I wanted to gain a picture of the extent to which the islanders were actually penetrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some three hundred thousand Japanese lived in the peninsula , but the Koreans numbered over seventeen millions and were breeding like rabbits . Would not the Japanese be swallowed up in the Korean flood ? Would not the Japanese influence , as far as blood went , he transient , external , and at most limited to the cities ? The great seaport Fusan was half Japanese , the capital , Seoul , had many Japanese , but what about the countryside ? I was soon to learn . In this village there was only one Japanese , the gendarme , feared and therefore respected by all , including his little Korean wife and his docile Korean children . Incidentally , and this is symptomatic of a possible future of the peninsula , the little Korean wife has never learned Japanese , whereas the gendarme speaks Korean bravely , if brokenly . I wondered whether Korea might not in the end absorb the scattered Japanese instead of the latter absorbing the Koreans . In this matter of population Korea has undoubtedly proved a disappointment to Japan . In proportion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries , if not the most densely populated , in the world . With an area about the size of California , Japan proper has a population of over fifty millions . Of its total land area only a very small part ( about twenty-five thousand square miles ) is at present arable . The farms are very small and the pressure of population , both in the agricultural districts and in the rapidly growing cities , intense . Moreover , the crowded Japanese population can not easily emigrate . The United States is practically forbidden ground , as are Canada and Australia , and in China the Japanese can not corn- pete with the low-waged natives . Had they been able , therefore , to migrate by the million to the less densely settled peninsula of Korea , the Japanese would have been in a fair way to solving their menacing population problem . When in the first flush of victory against Russia a real dominion over Korea was awarded Japan , it was commonly believed that here was to be found the long-sought home for these surplus Japanese millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dominions beyond the Sea , as Russia was peopling Siberia , as America had colonized the Middle West and the Far West . There would be farms and jobs for new millions . There would be a new Japan in the ancient Korean peninsula . There seemed to be good reason for optimism . Korea , with an area three-fifths as large as that of Japan , was supposed to contain only some twelve millions of people . She was rich in untouched mineral resources . If she could support twelve millions under her corrupt native rulers , how much more would she maintain under a scientific Japanese administration ? Two blades of grass would grow where one had grown before ; two men would live well where one had starved before , and of these two one would be a Japanese . To-day it seems improbable that this second man will be a Japanese . There is not much room in Korea for immigration , for the native population is larger than was imagined , and under Japanese rule it is growing rapidly . The immigrant workman from Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Japanese farmer , though more skilful than the Korean , does not wish to leave his native rice-patch . The Koreans are settled on the land , and on the land they will stay and breed . Fifty years from now the peninsula will be inhabited by the descendants of native Koreans , not by the descendants of Japanese immigrants . Japan can no more people Korea than Europe could people India . If , therefore , Japan succeeds in Japanizing Korea she will do so not by placing a Japanese population in the peninsula , nor by propaganda in Loyalty rooms . but by giving to Korea a just , wise , and beneficent administration , by making Korea a better place to live in and an easier place in which to make a living . Japan 's chief reliance should be on her capable industrial civilization and her excellent administrative ability . That Japan has vastly improved the economic and cultural conditions of Korea is obvious even to the most careless traveler . From the car window one sees the once bare mountains covered with young trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been built and improved , railroads constructed , agriculture extended and made more intensive , and splendid technical schools have been established . The Japanese are introducing science , method , and careful administration into the country . In the little trade schools , in the schools for seri-culture , in the agricultural experiment stations , Koreans are gaining a new insight into the art of making a living . Though taxes and prices are higher than before , the country is more prosperous and the lot of the average Korean has been improved . The city of Seoul has been transformed , Occidentalized . The taskof modernizing Korea has only begun , but the progress is already astonishing . From the point of view of this economic development , Japanese rule in Korea could hardly be more successful . Everything is done to improve conditions , and whether this is done primarily for Koreans or for Japanese makes little difference so long as the result is good . Of all the gifts of Japan to Korea , none has been better or more fruitful than security . The Korean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earns and saves will be taken from him . He knows that taxes , although heavy , will be definite and that there will be no illegal extortion . He can , therefore , afford to become a more efficient worker in agricultural and industrial arts . He can afford to improve his lot and advance . Koreans need no longer fear to be economically ambitious . This new security and new ambition of the Korean are illustrated by his changed attitude toward saving . In the old days the only true thrift consisted in taking no thought of the morrow . If a Korean became rich he was likely to be robbed by bandits , unofficial and official . The gentlemen of the capital who KOREA AN EXPERIMENT IN DENATIONALIZATION 397 ruled the country districts had a short and summary way of extracting surplus wealth from any one rash enough to accumulate it . Industrial organization being ineffective , there was no reason why a man should work harder than he was forced to , or save money in order that some one else might take it from him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beggar could be something of a gentleman so long as he did not soil his hands with labor . Su the white-clad Koreans worked in leisurely fashion , doing just enough to get their rice , and then smoking their long pipes and chatting during the idle hours . The Korean was a natural-born gentleman with native grace and dignity , and he knew how to live . All this was changed by the Japanese administration . It was not in Japan 's interest that the Koreans should cultivate their laziness too intensively , and so everything was done to uproot this inconvenient virtue . A campaign for the inculcation of thrift was begun , pamphlets were issued by the tens of thousands , and government representatives toured the country , lecturing the Koreans on the advantage of saving . At first the Koreans resisted . They believed that the Japanese wanted them to save merely in order to tax them more heavily . As for depositing their money with the distrusted government , that was an obvious absurdity . Nevertheless , saving has begun . and today there are over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The thrift campaign is a long step toward converting Korea into a capitalistic country . Yet it does not follow that even good administration and prosperity will make loyal Japanese out of Koreans . Undoubtedly the Koreans will make much of their new opportunities . They are naturally intelligent , the best linguists of the Orient , and , while not as quick , energetic , or ambitious as the Japanese , they nevertheless win along many lines , much as the tortoise won from the hare . True , they have not yet succeeded ? perhaps have not been permitted to succeed ? in large capitalistic undertakings , and the banks , the big retail stores , and big business generally are in Japanese hands . But the Korean mass advances and year by year it will demand greater economic as well as political recognition . The question is : Will Japan with her traditions know how to concede these rights promptly and gracefully ? Will she rake full account of Korean susceptibilities , grant freedom , and tolerate discussion ? Or will she use force ? On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuasion , repression rather than freedom . There has been , and there still is , a strict political censorship . The full measure of Japanese success in Korea could be more easily-ascertained and more readily acknowledged if there were greater freedom in the peninsula , were there not an official terrorism which covers up abuses and ruthlessly represses public opinion or free expression of discontent . Possessing only the official Japanese version of the progress in Korea , we are forced to accept all reports with a grain of salt , not disregarding the excellent work accomplished , but recalling at least that we have here a subject population , deprived of primary civil and political rights , unable to express disapproval , repressed and silent . If in such a situation one is grudging in praise , the fault lies with Japan 's military authorities , who in their wisdom have deprived us of the right to hear the evidence in the case . In some respects the Japanese record " in Korea has its bad side . This was especially true in the beginning , when Japanese intervention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In part those brutal methods were due to a militaristic policy and in part to the incapacity or unwillingness of the government to prevent the excesses of Japanese adventurers who preyed on the country and terrorized its inhabitants . Even today all evils have not been entirely eradicated . There remains a general odor of **25;358;TOOLONG exploitation about Japanese rule in Korea , as well as a sense of respectable commercial venality , an evidence of discrimination in favor of Japanese and against Koreans , a feeling that the government is not quite honest or straightforward or progressive , as is the American government in the Philippines . One leaves Korea with an unpleasant taste in the mouth , with a sympathy for the tall , gentle , wrong-headed Koreans , in their loose white clothes , their impossible shoes , and their curious bird-cage hats . One feels sorry for them in their servitude toward the efficient and rather pompous Japanese officials . This is the reverse of the excellent work of economic development in Korea in which Japan is succeeding so admirably and to which she has brought her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedantic formalism , and , above all , her unity . While she has faced the economic problem as a whole and faced it concretely , while she has cut clean through a mass of ignorant and venal obstruction , she has often erred on the side of violence and roughness and she has failed to take into account the susceptibilities of the subject people . Japan apan is wholly to succeed , however , it is exactly these susceptibilities that must be taken into account . If you are to change a population you must know what to change and what to leave alone . Great Britain has won the loyalty of the French Canadians by allowing diem to remain as French , as utterly on-English , as they were in the days of Champlain . If the seemingly gentle Korean is not to prove refractory , one must learn to lead and not drive him . If he is to be made Japanese he must be made more Korean than ever . In some respects all peoples change slowly ; it is proverbial that conservatism begins at home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house ; he will hardly ever change his dress , the cut of his beard -- if he has one ? his sumptuary prejudices and predilections , his attitude toward his wife and children . He will change his belief more readily than his ritual ; his form of government more easily than his method of drinking tea . The Prussian has never learned this , the British have learned it slowly , and the French seem to have known it by tact and instinct , and , as a consequence , India , Egypt , Tonking , and Algiers are ruled by respect for susceptibilities , the conquering nation deciding all questions which are important , while leaving the trivial , but to the native essential , mat-tens to native taste and tradition : The Japanese in Korea are learning this only by hard knocks and dubious experiences . At first these valiant little men , who had defeated Russia , were roughshod and brutal ; they were Prussian in their insistence upon things being done as they believed they should be done . And so they cut off the topknots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are likely to miss the enormity of this offense . What the pigtail or queue was to the Chinese , that and more is the topknot to the Korean . It is a twisted coil of hair worn on the top of the head and protected by a fine crinoline hat resembling a black bird-cage . Personally I do not like either topknot or bird-cage hat , as the Japanese did not , but this is a question of taste and tradition and neither my business nor that of the Japanese . The Korean youth wears twin plaits down his back until he is old enough to be dignified with the topknot ; thereafter he ceases to be " a half-man " and becomes a real man . If you and I do not like the topknot neither does the Korean , nor does the Chinese , like us red-faced , green-eyed barbarians . If you are to rule Korea , build schools and roads and courts of justice , but leave their topknots alone . Just what occurred after this battle of the topknots I have never been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outburst these hirsute trophies grew quietly up again . It was a triumph of nature and national pride over the irrational rule of force . The topknot , cut off at the roots and crushed to the scalp , rose again . The aftermath of this victory of the Koreans was revealed to me at the funeral of the prince . I forget the name of this particular Korean prince , but any one of a curious turn may at his leisure discover his true name and all his royal and divine titles . I can only identify him by stating that he died a few years ago , that he lay in state for a long time , waiting until the geomancers determined upon a propitious day for his funeral , and that he was finally interred on a cool , crisp spring day toward the end of March , 1917 . So much for the prince . I was little concerned with him as he lay unseen in the immense catafalque carried upon the shoulders of a hundred ragged men in brown sackcloth . I was much more interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sweating professional mourners ; in the picturesque , Oriental rag-tag of the procession ; in the tens of thousands of Koreans , men and women and pretty little saucer-faced babies , who lined the streets of Seoul . As far as impressions went , Japan might have been a million miles and a million years away . The i topknot was everywhere ; it stood aloft to proclaim that Korea possessed some rights that could not be destroyed . The scene was irredeemably Korean . The trim little Japanese ? women in their closely wrapped kimonos were lost in a sea of Korean women dressed in bright green and white coats , thrown over the head and with the sleeves empty . Everywhere was the white or dirty white long robe of the Korean man . There was no slightest trace of sorrow over the prince who had been dead long enough to be forgotten . It was a holiday , a spectacle . The Koreans were sunning themselves gloriously and happily while the prince 's little body lay somewhere in the huge ugly catafalque . This sort of street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquest of one people by another . The Japanese are teaching the Koreans to save , to work , to become clever artificers , to go to school , to learn Japanese . But they do not teach them to become Japanese . Here at this funeral the clean streets , the good order , the disciplined soldiery and police , were all signs of Japanese domination , but if you looked at the people it seemed as though this domination , on this sunny holiday , at least , was only skin-deep . Perhaps the Japanese policeman who stood near me was of the same pessimistic belief . He was a fussy little man resembling a rat with side-whiskers , and he was persistently gesticulating and pushing , and occasionally he struck an obstreperous Korean with his scabbard in his efforts to keep the " low people " front climbing up to the best positions on the sloping street . For " high people " like me and the Japanese and the Korean yang-bans , who are glorious , easy-stepping , noble Micawbets , it was permissible to occupy exalted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spectacle from an inferior level or else be pinched , pushed , and scabbarde.d . The royal prince , whatever else his history , may , at least , serve as a milestone . He was buried thirteen years after Japan invaded Korea in her war against Russia , and nine years after the formal annexation of Korea by Japan . In these thirteen years much has been accomplished economically , but little , I take it , has been changed in the matter of topknots , intrinsic culture , or the innermost souls of the Koreans . But thirteen years is as a day in national evolution . Will Japan finally succeed in converting these Koreans into Japanese ? Will she succeed in the long run in this process of denationalization and re-nationalization ? It would be effrontery for me to pass judgment on this question , and it is dangerous even to hazard a guess as to theoutcome . Perhaps one ought not even to approach the problem in this didactic spirit . It is a moving spectacle , a vast drama , and it is perhaps for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to criticize , not to hiss the villain or applaud the hero , but to look ? and learn . For what is now being tried in Korea , despite certain new circumstances , is no new thing under the sun . We have seen something like this before in Judea. in Persia , in Gaul , in Britain , in Ireland , India , Egypt , Alsace , and Poland . Yet one can not quite help guessing , and it is at least permissible to ask questions . And the one most significant and searching question seems to be this : Can you supersede a language , a civilization , and an ancient tradition in a compact , growing people like the Korean ? In another thirty years the Korean population will probably be doubled and children will be born faster than they can be taught Japanese . The school equipment must he vastly increased indeed if a real change of tongues is to be accomplished , and even then the language spoken at home will be Korean . What language the business men use is not significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Korean nationality be accomplished , therefore , in fifty years or in a hundred or in two hundred ? And time is an element in the problem . If Korea is to be a bulwark of Japan , it must be composed of loyal people . The chances are that with the growth of education , with new ideas of democracy and nationality seeping in from abroad , Korea , if it is to be forcibly Japanized , will be a source of weakness rather than of strength . Prussia , with a six-to-one population , failed to Prussianize Poland . Can Japan , with only a three-to-one ascendancy , Japanize Korea ? The crux of the problem will appear when , and if , Japan is in danger . Will the Koreans run to the Japanese colors ? Will they enlist as the Scotch enlist under an English king or the Hanoverians under a king of Prussia ? Or will they hold aloof ? Or will they revolt ? The question is not for us to decide . ? It will depend in part at least upon Japan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it will also depend upon the direction in which the whole world moves in this pregnant century .
