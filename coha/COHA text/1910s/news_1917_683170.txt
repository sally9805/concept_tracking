txt OUR WASTE IN HUMAN ENERGY . Will the War Teach Us to Bring the Best American Brains to Bear Upon National Problems ? The best thought of this country has for sonte time been directed toward the problem of how America is going to emerge from the European war a victor . Or , in other words , is it possible for us to gain anything from a supreme world catastrophe from which we have hitherto held aloof , but to which now we have committed ourselves ? as we ought to have done before in my opinion ? Is it true among nations , as it is among individuals , that experience is the only teacher ? The question is not one of our immediate material gain . We have already made too much money out of the war . Neither do I care to indulge in any ' Immediate speculations as to whether this Republic of ours is going to persist indefinitely under the same form of government which has held it together up to the present time . Upon the conclusion of peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must all brace ourselves for that . What concerns us most just now is whether our part In the European war Is going to jolt us into a higher standard of conduct , Is going to make us better and more capable of taking care of ourselves . To some of us America appears to be trembling over the brink of a deep abyss ; to others we are but going through a phase of our existence which is going to place us on the higher round of the ladder of civilization . I should like to point out briefly one of our most obvious weaknesses , and to suggest some considerations for improving our methods of government . The process must necessarily be slow . But at least a proper diagnosis is necessary to any improvement . That we are better than we were , at least from a superficial viewpoint , is evident . Our methods of conducting Presidential campaigns are cleaner and more orderly . There is a more general utilitarian awakening among our people than since the civil war . Our moral consciousness is more quickened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least they show which way the wind blows . Higher standards of conduct prevail . We are less vulgar than we were , more serious , more genuinely alive to our own shortcomings , more sensitive . This country is divided into various groups of people , usually in accordance with their position in the economic scale . Among them the men who are capable of doing this country the most good , everything considered , are the business men who have become so successful that they have leisure . I dismiss the professors , the literary workers , in fact of the so-called thinkers . They are necessary , of course , to the well-being and progress of the State . Many of them are wild animals . Many of them are inconsequential " highhrows . " Some of them are competent , a few of them are really worth while ? lofty minds ahead of their time . But the best raw material we have on hand to make our country a better one to live in is the successful business man . lie knows what drudgery means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive ability . He has acquired , in a very practical school , the kind of efficiency which produces the right results . Ile has not spent tits life in contact with men in a lecture room or a clinic , but . in a fierce struggle tor existence , lie has taken his own final measure and the measure of others . lie has learned to be shrewd and to be generous , when to risk and when to conserve . In short , in the greatest arena of endeavor the world has ever seen ho 1.9 a master spirit . Why is it , then , that the business men of America , take them as a whole , are not doing more for their country Why is it that their energies , once haylug acquired the personal object fot which they started out , are not directed snore into the channel of public eervicel Think of men in the brief past . like Jay Gould and Edwin H. Harriman , and the enormous waste of energy they reveal , It is doubtful whether a large fortune , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any real benefit . What helps most is ideas . Money does not make ideas . Indeed , the mere accumulation of money beyond a certain point i8 not attractive to big men . Large wealth usually comes of itself and is incidental to the kind of game the liarrimans and Goulds like to play . Of late years the energies of a proportion of our business men have no doubt been directed into public channels . The way they , are coming forward to help in this war is encouraging , although we must not forget that this is a crisis . We need these men most between times . Most of us know one or more of them who , having " made their pile , " have been spending their leisure trying to Make things better , But the men who are actively engaged in spending their leisure for the good of the State are still exceptions , and until it becomes generally recognized that It Is the duty of every successful business man to serve his country not only during crises but all the time we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At present we are quite largely governed by a set of men who have been successful at nothing else but the doubtful technique of the politician . The head of a large department store does not pass his time making speeches . If he were supplanted by the average Congressman the probability is that the shop would close its doors inside of a year . Wo all know this , but nothing definite Is being done shout it because The successful business man . who has nobody quite knows how to go about it , so to speak , " arrived . " is laboring under one serious disadvantage . All his life he has moved along the lines of least resistance , accomplishing ends without fuss and with no appeal to the gallery . As a rule , he has had no time to think about the problems of government or to become well versed in its history or procedure . He is unacquainted with parliamentary law . Aside from brief statements made at Directors ' meetings , he has not learned how to express himself on his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' the results that the American people are really looking for . But owing to the safeguards which the fathers of the Constitution and of our Government machinery were obliged to build around it , all these things are now an Inevitable part of this machinery , Inextricably mixed up with It . The consequence is that the business man with leisure on his hands stands abashed and awkward upon the threshold of a new career that might result in incalculable benefit to his country . lie feels . toward it much w as a man might feel ho determines In middle life to become an actor . If he overcothes his Instinctive lack of sympathy with so much of the incompetence displayed and makes up Ills mind , like a soldier in the ranks , to learn the " business " of the politician , he then discovers that his path has been purposely strewn with obstacles by those Who have intrenched themselves * ? lbin the sacred precincts of the Government domain . Sometimes he goes on and becomes a real power , and , rapidly mastering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important than it is ? he is able to bring the whole force of his previous practical training with crushing effect on the problems of the State . But , generally speaking , he turns back from the threshold in disgust , and thereafter devotes his time to sports , travel , and social pleasures . It is a great pity  --  this waste of o much pure practical ability , which ought to be diverted to tile benefit of the whole people . That 19 what we ought to learn from the war by a study of German methods , as Mr. Gerard recently pointed out . Germany has not been making this mistake . For many years , before the war broke out Germany was using her practical business men In precisely the way I have indicated . Germany will fail to win the war because the military idea Germany stands for can never be acceptable in a world of people who are coming more and more to a better understanding of the rights of man . What we should do , however , in to set before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency in admini8t ? a.tion . At the same time we should set out with all the power in us to develop that true nobleness of purpose , that ideal of the eventual brotherhood of man , which lies in the hearts of all of us who love the very fabric of our democracy  --  with all ? Its glaring faults . if we are to persist in the right way we must learn from Germany how to make use of our best men , and not let them go so largely to waste . Can we do this ? In helping to rid the world of autocracy can we graft on our democratic life the efficiency of autocracy ? 1 have hinted at the embarrassment which those feel when , being free at last from their labors and willing ' to lend a hand to the State , they make the attempt to be of service . Why should it take a national crisis to bring them all to the front ? America In a crisis in doing what England and France have done . But if we are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should learn this great fact : namely , that real progress upward depends upon voluntary initiative . It is not enough to watt until we are forced to act . if our Government is to persist and its machinery to be made better , we must be able to bring to bear upon it . in a steady pressure the highest practical intelligence we possess , and do this as much in time of peace as in war . ? It is our great fault that we are not able to do this . We only raise out standards of efficiency under enormous premiere . ' Any one who takes the trouble to examine the available material among our business men and to meditate upon it must be astonished at its quantity and quality . In every ' State in this union is a considerable grdup of successful men of affairs who have long ago solved the problem of their own bread and butter , who are sincerely anxious to pass the rest of their lives in helping others lead better lives , and who do n't know how to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are studying the problem of our Government . Most of them have decided opinions about it . A large proportion belong to sonic political organization , do their share of subscribing to campaign funds , and go through all the forms of being good citizens . Bet it is n't one fraction of what they ought to do . The singular part of all thin is that a large number of these men are extremely radical in their views ? fully as radical as our advanced Socialists , but in quite a different manner . There are certain practical , fundamental , human experiences which they have all had in common . , The main problem is how to get them together in such a manner that their combined abilities will be enlisted for the benefit of the State . Our common and indeed Inevitable mcthod of doing anything in this country when we wish to interest a lot of people is to start some sort of organization . - We can all of us call to mind civic leagues and numberless civic associations , . nil of them inaugurated for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people have a genius for this sort of thing . It is almost like a chronio ailment . As a rule , the moment an organization like this starts it begins to degenerate . Somebody has an axe to grind . One man is jealous of another man . Still another wants to domineer . Then we have our unhappy political methods repeated in which if any good thing is accomplished at all it is the result of a series of compromises . ? Many conventional attempts have been made to interest out ' business men , some of them fairly successful , but none of them what they ought to be . In my opinion , only those men themselves , Rating independently , taking the matter into their own hands , can accomplish for our Government what ought to be done . A few of them ought to get together to talk it over , just as quietly as if they yore stating some new enterprise ; they do n't need oratory or lobbying , or lawyers , or any political chicanery . All they need is their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery . Tile reason why government in not successful is because it Is n't subject continuously to competition : when a Goyeminent gets too bad a war is likely to come along and put it out of business when it is too late . Why should a Government he run on business principles when all the men in the country who know business principles etend aloof from it ? ' THOMAS L. MASSON , '
