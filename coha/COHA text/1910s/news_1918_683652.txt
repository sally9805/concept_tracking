Eisenman , who was put through a severe examination , defended his Own committee against any delinquency . He maintained that the Supply Committee , of which he is the active head , had carried out the work of parceling out contracts and hurrying the manufacture of equipment , but that the Quartermaster General 's Department had failed to get the equipment to the camps . Although sufficient blankets had been made to supply all the men in camp , Mr. Eisenman said , the Quartermaster General 's Department blundered in shipping too many blankets to some camps , while others had none . The department , he said , was also at fault in not having informed the Supply Committee as to exactly how many unifo.ans would be needed , this causing delay in getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to various members of the Supply Committee , the witness testifying that nearly all of them were engaged in supplying the Government with equipment for the army . Senator brought out that the Supply Committee members did not vote on contracts in which their firms were directly interested . Denies Evasion of Law . The Tennessee Senator pointedly asked Mr. Eisenman if the Supply Committee members had avoided voting so as to keep from violating Section 3 of the food law , which forbids " voluntary or paid agents " of the Government from participating in. any Government contract in which they are financially concerned . Mr. Eisenman let Senator know that ho resented the insinuation that the members were trying to " conveniently dodge the law , " as the Senator put it . He defended the Supply Committee against any suggestion of favoritism in the award of contracts to its members . . At one point in the evidence Mr. Eisenman became aroused over questions about why the army contracts had been allowed to lag . He said he felt that the Senators were unjustly insinuating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insinuations of Senators here are unfair and uncalled for , " he exclaimed , heatedly . " I do n't think it is fair to let such stuff go upon the record as has been given before this committee in the last few days . " The witness was led into an explanation of the activities of the Base Sorting Plant in New York , one of the Owners of which Is Ira I. Kaplan , brother of Samuel Kaplan , chief advisor to Mr. Eisenman on the Supply Committee . Mr. Eisenman insisted that the rag-sorting plant As not a " grafting " outfit , as had been intimated by witnesses before the committee , and that he had approved the contract under which it operated . Mr. Eisenman said the Supply . Committee bad made purchases for the army aggregating $600,000,000 . " What I 'd like to know , " interrupted Senator Hitchcock , " is why , with a country of such vast resources as ours , and such tremendous production , we have been unable to equip 1,300,000 men with clothing , overcoats , and shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been no shoe shortage , ' ' replied Mr. Eisenman . Shortage of Equipment . " Well , at least thousands of pairs of shoes supplied do n't fit the soldiers ' feet , " commented Senator Hitchcock . " It can not be denied that there has been a serious shortage In uniform and blanket equipment . Deaths have resulted in some of the camps and have been laid , by some , to lack of sufficient clothing in the severe weather . " " Well , when more men were called out for service than had been anticipated and they had to be equipped , something had to happen , and it did happen , " replied Mr. Eisenman . " A shortage had to come somewhere . If we had known last May that we would be called upon to equip an army of the size that was called , we would have done it without delay . " When were you informed how many men you would have to equip ? " asked Senator - Hitchcock . ' We were never officially Informed of it. - " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see that there was adequate equipment for even , soldier ? " demanded Senator Weeks . " Was n't that the job you had ? " " It was the job of the Quartermaster General 's Department , " was the reply . Senator Frelinghuysen remarked that the Supply Committee ought to have made sure that the men had adequate clothing and blankets . " Well , if the Quartermaster General has routed clothing and blankets to points of the greatest need there would not have been any shortage , " answered Mr. Eisenman . I do n't like to criticise the Quartermaster General , but that 's a responsibility I can not assume . In some camps there were as many as nine blankets to each man , while other camps had none . Now , there was something wrong with the shipments of those blankets  --  that 's , evident . " Senator wanted to know if Mr. Eisenman was financially interested in any contract for army supplies . The witness replied that the Cleveland Worsted Mills , of which he is a stockholder : had two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to El/seaman 's Firm . " I never advised the purchase of the wool from - that company and had no part in making the contracts , " explained Mr. Eisenman . " But the contracts were let by the Supply Committee to your firm ? Yes . that 's right . " You asitume responsibility : tor tic ? 41 ( contracts ? ; , t Senator asked . ? " Yes , but ' the Depot Quartermaster 's DePartment- at Cleveland had placed the orders with the firm before I knew anything about it , " replied the witness . " I had nothing to do with getting the contract . " The two contracts , the witness explained , called for 100,000 yards , each . oi ! suiting material . The profit to his firm was approximately $30,000 on the two orders . " Now , did you know that Congress passed a law at the last sessiop , prohibiting any agent of the Government from dealing with himself in Government contract work ? " demanded Senator . " I knew that very well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you permitted that contract to he made between your firm and the Government ? ? ' " The contracts were made by the Supply Committee . I have already explained that I took no part in them whatever . " " Well , how did you get around the law ? " There was no getting around ' about it . We let contracts of that character every day.7 " You de " " Oh , yes . " " Well , that 's what this committee wants to know about ; it 's quite important , " commented Senator . " I 'll tell you anything you want to know about it . " replied Mr. Eisenman . Senator asked if any contract for Government supplies had been let to Jacob H. Brown , woolen manufacturer and member of the Supply Committee . " Oh , yes , " replied Mr. Eisenman . A. L. Scott of the International Cotton M1118 , another member of the Sup ply Committee , Mr. . Eisenman said , had contracts to supply cotton duck to the army . Another member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Turner , the witness said ; he got orders for cotton duck . Mr. Eisenman testified that many of the contracts with members of the Supply Committee were let at prices 30 per cent . below what they could have got . in the open market . Senator Frelinghuysen interrogated Mr. Eisenman as to the character of cloth manufactured for army uniforms . He said he had been informed that because of a reduction in the weight of cloth American troops had been sent to France with uniforms 2 ? . per cent . Inferior to those worn by the British and French . " I felt all along that we ought to give them the best procurable material regardless of expense . " replied Mr. Eisenman . " General Pershing seemed satisfied with the uniforms supplied our men . The cloth ' we have been supplying has been of excellent quality . If we used all wool in making it we would run out of wool before we got all our army supplied with uniforms . And I want to suggest that attention be turned to our producing all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are going to need all we can get . " When Senator suggested that the Supply Committee ought to have seen that uniforms and blankets reached the training camps in adequate quantity , Mr. Eisenman put the blame on the Quartermaster General 's Department . " They did n't tell us how many were needed . " he testified . " We had to work in the dark . " " Well , it was your job to find out , " insisted Mr. . " That 's uncalled for and unfair , " replied Mr. Eisenman . " I want to tell this committee that I 'm not dealing in dry bones . ? I 'm dealing in flesh and blood facts . I 'm going . to give the committee some scenery . ' " We do n't care anything about the scenery , " rejoined Mr. . " Stick to facts . " " I 'll not be shut up ; I 'll tell the committee the whole thing , " Insisted Mr. Eisenman . ? " The witness is irascible and borders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weeks . ? - Both-  Eisenman and Sa fuel Kaplan ; : his Md .. Adviser , defend the operation of the base sorting plant in New York . Senator Wadsworth reminded Mr. Kaplan that the Quartermaster General 's Department had canceled the rag contract after Captain Pearless of that department had investigated the profit made at the 6-cent-a-pound price fixed in the contract last June . Mr. Kaplan asserted that his brother 's firm knew nothing of the investigation by the Quartermaster General 's Department and that its action in relinquishing all profit was purely voluntary . Clause Not in Contract . " it was part of the contract that , no matter if the price was 6 cents or what , the profit to be made was not to exceed ors cent a pound , " said Mr. Kaplan . When Senator asked Mr Kaplan to show such a clause in the contract , Mr. Kaplan turned to the docu ? ment , but the clause was not in it . Mr. Kaplan recalled then that a separate clause had been drawn up to that effect and sent ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quartermaster General had overlooked it . Senator developed that Samuel and Ira Kaplan , brothers of the witness , also were members of B. D. Kaplar &; Co. , a New York rag collecting firm . Senator inquired why alleged " dummies " formed the Base Sorting Company , and Mr. Kaplan disclaimed knowledge of the details . Mr. Eisenman will resume the witness stand tomorrow .
