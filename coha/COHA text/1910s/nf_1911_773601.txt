txt // account for an effect of which there is no doubt , any cause , however foolish , is made welcome , " it is impossible not to say " Thou sayest it " ; as also in another case , where he lays it down that " Were corporeal pleasures dignified over and above i.e. , beside the natural propensity which incites us to them with a place in a high class , they would infallibly disturb the balance of the mind by outweighing the social affections . This is a satisfactory final cause for refusing to these pleasures any degree of dignity . " 1 I am tempted to quote Kames 's philosophy of the use of tobacco 2 also , but the stuff and method of his first volume must be sufficiently intelligible already . The second , much more to the purpose , is considerably less interesting . A very long chapter deals with Beauty of Language with respect to Sound , Signification , Resemblance between Sound and Signification , and Metre . It is abundantly stocked with well-chosen examples from a wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingenious and sometimes both new and bold , as where at the outset Karnes has the audacity to contradiet Aristotle , by implication at least , and lay it down that " of all the line arts , painting and sculpture only are in their nature imitative. " 8 But it is not free from the influence of the idols of its time . Of such , in one kind , may be cited the attribution to Milton of " many careless lines " ; 4 for if there is one thing certain in the ' risky and speculative range of literary dogmatism , it is that Milton never wrote a " careless " line in his life . If his lines are ever bad ( and perhaps they are sometimes ) , they are bad deliberately and of malice . In another and more serious kind may be ranged the predominating determination to confuse the sensual with the intellectual side of poetry . This , of course , is Kames 's root-idea ; but that it is a root of evil may be shown sufficiently by the following passage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject he is as wrong as nearly all his contemporaries . He is talking of a pause between adjective and substantive.5 What occurs to him is that " a quality can not exist independent of a subject , nor are they separable even in imagination , because they make // part of the same idea , and for that reason , with respect to melody as well as to sense , it must be disagreeable to bestow upon the adjective a sort of independent existence by interjecting a pause between it and its substantive . " His examples are no doubt vitiated by the obsession of the obligatory " middle " pause , which makes him imagine one between adjective and substantive in " The rest , his many-coloured robe concealed , " where the only real pause , poetic as well as grammatical , is at " rest . " But his principle is clear , and it is as clearly a wrong principle . It ignores the great fact glanced at above , that the pleasure of poetry is double ? intellectual and sensual ? and that the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And in the second place , even on its own theory , it credits the mere intellect with too sluggish faculties . In the first line which Karnes suggests as " harsh and unpleasant " for this reason , i0 Of thousand bright inhabitants of air , " the pause at " bright " is so slight a one that some might deny its existence . But if it be held necessary , can we refuse to the subtilitas intellectus the power of halting , for the second of a second , to conceive the joint idea of number and brightness , before it moves further to enrich this by the notion of " inhabitants of air " ? The mere and literal Lockist may do so ; but no other will . The Figures enjoy a space which , without being surprised at it , one grudges ; and the Unities are handled rather oddly , while a digression of some fifty pages on Gardening and Architecture speaks for itself . The conclusion on the Standard of Taste is singularly inconclusive ; and an interesting appendix on " terms defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , one of the terms so dealt with has anything specially to do with literature or art at all . Nevertheless , though it is easy to be smart upon Karnes , and not very difficult to expose serious inadequacies and errors both in the general scheme and the particular execution , the Elements of Criticism is a book of very great interest and importance , and worthy of much more attention than it has for a long // time past received . To begin with , his presentation , at the very outset of his hook , of Criticism as " the most agreeable of all amusements " was one of those apparently new and pleasant shocks to the general which are , in reality , only the expression of an idea for some time germinating and maturing in the public mind . Even Addison , even Pope , while praising and preaching Criticism , had half-flouted and half-apologised for it . Swift , a great critic on his own day , had flouted it almost or altogether in others . The general idea of the critic had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmless , pedant . Karnes presented him as something quite different , ? as a man no doubt of learning , but also of position and of the world , " amusing , " as well as exercising himself , and bringing the fashionable philosophy to the support of his amusement . But he did more than this . His appreciation of Shakespeare is , taking it together ( and his references to the subject are numerous and important ) , the best of his age . His citations show a remarkable relish for the Shakespearian humour , and though he can not clear his mind entirely from the " blemishand-beauty " cant , which is ingrained in the Classical theory , and which , as we saw , infected even such a critic as Longinus , he is far freer from it than either Johnson or Blair . In his chapter on the Unities he comes very near to Hurd 2 ( to whom , as the Elements of Criticism preceded the Letters on Chivalry in time , he may have given a hint ) in recognising the true Romantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different interests work together , or contrast advantageously . He has a most lucid and sensible exposure of the difference between the conditions of the Greek theatre and ours . In short , he would stand very high if he were not possessed with the pseudological mania which makes him calmly and gravely write " Though a cube is more agreeable in itself than a parallelopipedon , 4 yet a large parallelopipedon set on its smaller base is by its elevation more agreeable , and hence the beauty of a Gothic // tower . " But this amabilis insania is in itself more amiable than insane . He wants to admit the Gothic tower , and that is the principal thing . Magdalen , and Merton , and Mechlin may well , in consideration of his slighting in their favour the more intrinsic charms of a cube , afford to let a smile flicker round their venerable skylines at his methodical insistence on justifying admiration of them by calling them large parallelopipeda set on their smaller ends . And the cube can console herself with his admission of her superior intrinsic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both , for the most part , absent , while much more than the merit of either , in method and closeness to the aim , is present , in the very remarkable Philosophy of Rhetoric 1 which Dr George Campbell began , and , to some extent , composed , as early as 1750 ; though he did not finish and publish it till nearly thirty years later ( 1777 ) . It may indeed be admitted that this piecemeal composition is not without its effect on the book , which contains some digressions ( especially one on Wit , Humour , and Ridicule , and another on the cause of the pleasure received from the exhibition of painful objects ) more excrescent than properly episodic . It is , moreover , somewhat weighted by the author 's strictly professional and educational design , in retaining as much of the mere business part of the ancient Rhetoric as would or might be useful to future preachers , advocates , or members of Parliament . Campbell , too , is a less " elegant " writer than Blair ; and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But here concessions are exhausted ; and the book , however much we may disagree with occasional expressions in it , remains the most important treatise on the New Rhetoric that the eighteenth century produced . Indeed , strange as it may seem , Whately 's , its principal formal successor in the nineteenth , is distinctly retrograde in comparison . The New Rhetoric ? the Art of Criticism ? this is what Campbell really attempts . He is rather chary of acknowlodging his own position , and , in fact , save in his title , seldom employs the term Rhetoric , no doubt partly from that unlucky contempt of scholastic appellations // which shows itself in his well-known attack on Logic . But his definition of " Eloquence " ? the term which he employs as a preferred synonym of Rhetoric itself ? is very important , and practically novel . The word " Eloquence , in its greatest latitude , denotes that art or talent by which the discourse is adapted to its end . " Now this , though he modestly shelters it under Quintilian 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also its exact correspondence with Cicero 's description of the best orator as he who dicendo animos delectact audientium et docet et permovet , is manifestly far more extensive than the latter of these , and much less vague than the former . In fact Rhetoric , new dubbed as Eloquence , becomes the Art of Literature , or in other words Criticism . It has been allowed that this bold and admirable challenge of the whole province ? for " discourse " is soon seen to include " writing " ? is not always so well supported . After an interesting introduction ( vindicating the challenge , and noting Karnes more especially as one who , though in a different way , had made it , before him ) , Campbell for a time , either because he is rather afraid of his own boldness , or to conciliate received opinions on the matter ( or , it has been suggested , because the book was written at different times , and with perhaps slightly different ends ) , proceeds to discuss various matters which have very little to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chapter , before referred to , on " The Nature and Use of the Scholastic Art of Syllogising , " he wrecks himself in a galley which he had not the slightest need to enter . The longer discourse on Evidence which precedes this is , of course , fully justified on the old conception of Rhetoric , but digressory , or at least excursory , on his own . The above-mentioned sections on Ridicule , and on the aesthetic pleasure derivable from painful subjects , are excursions into the debatable kinds between literature and Ethics , though much less extravagant than those of Kames , and perhaps , as excursions , not absolutely to be barred or banned ; while chapters vii. - x. , which deal with the " Consideration of Hearers , " &c.,; &c.,; are once more Aristotelian relapses , pardonable if not strictly necessary . But not quite a third part of the whole treatise is occupied by this First Book of // the three into which it is divided ; and not a little of this third is , strictly or by a little allowance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point without exception or digression oaf ' any kind , so that the Aristotelian distribution is exactly reversed . The titles of the two Books , " The Foundations and Essential Properties of Elocution , " and " The Discriminating Properties of Elocution , " must be taken with due regard to Campbell 's use of the last word . ' But they require hardly any other proviso or allowance . He first , with that mixture of boldness and straight-hitting which is his great merit , attacks the general principles of the use of Language , and proceeds to lay down nine Canons of Verbal Criticism , which are in the main so sound and so acute that they are not obsolete to the present day . There is more that is arbitrary elsewhere , and Campbell seems sometimes to retrograde over the line which separates Rhetoric and Composition . But it must be remembered that this line has never been very exactly drawn , and has , both in Scotland and in America , if not also in England , been often treated as almost non-existent up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Qualities of Style ? Perspicuity , Vivacity , Elegance , Animation , and Music ? Campbell may be thought to be not wholly happy . For the three middle qualities are practically one , and it is even questionable whether Music would not be best included with them in some general term , designating whatever is added by style proper to Perspicuity , or the sufficient but unadorned conveyance of meaning . As , however , is very common , if not universal , with him , his treatment is in advance of his nomenclature , for the rest of the book ? nearly a full half of it ? is in fact devoted to the two heads of Perspicuity and Vivacity , the latter tacitly subsuming all the three minor qualities . And there is new and good method in the treatment of Vivacity , as shown first by the choice of words , secondly by their number , and thirdly by their arrangement , while a section // under the first head on " words considered as sounds " comes very near to the truth . That there should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , as Campbell treats it , it is in no way objectionable . His iconoclasm as to logical Forms becomes much more in place , and much more effective , in regard to rhetorical Figures . One , however , of the best features of the work has hardly yet been noticed ; and that is the abundance of examples , and the thorough way in which they are discussed . To a reader turning the book over without much care it may seem inferior as a thesaurus to Karnes , because the passages quoted are as a rule embedded in the text , and not given separately , in the fashion which makes of large parts of the Elements of Criticism a sort of anthology , a collection of beauties or deformities , as the case may be . But this is in accordance with the singularly businesslike character of Campbell 's work throughout . And if it also seem that , he does not launch out enough in appreciation of Looks or authors as wholes , let it be remembered that English critieism was still in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in academic circles was not very satisfactory . It would not , of course , be impossible to produce from him examples of those obsessions of the time which we have noticed in his two compatriots , as we shall notice them in the far greater Johnson . But he could not well escape these obsessions , and he suffers from them in a very mild form . James Harris , ' author of Hermes ( and of the house of Malmesbury , which was ennobled in the next generation ) , is perhaps the chief writer whom England , in the narrower sense , has to set against Blair , Kames , and Campbell in mid-eighteenth century . But he is disappointing . It would not be reasonable to quarrel with the Hermes itself for not being literary , because it does not pretend to be anything but grammatical ; and the Philosophical Arrangements , though they do sometimes approach literature , may plead benefit of title for not doing so oftener . But the Discourse on Music , Painting , and Poetry , and the Philological Enquiries ? in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters " in the higher // sense ? hold out some prospects . The performance is but little . Readers of Boswell will remember that Johnson , though the author of Hermes was very polite to him , both personally and with the pen , used , to his henchman 's surprise and grief , to speak very roughly of Harris , applying to him on one occasion the famous and damning phrase , " a prig , and a bad prig , " and elsewhere hinting doubts as to his competency in Greek . That the reproach of priggishness was deserved ( whether with the aggravation or not ) nobody can read half-a-dozen pages of Harris without allowing , ? his would-be complimentary observation on Fielding 1 would determine by itself . But the principal note of Harris , as a critic , is not so much priggishness as confused superficiality . These qualities are less visible in the Dialogue ( which is an extremely short , not contemptible , but also not unimportant , exercitation in the direction of ' Esthetic proper ) than in the Enquiries , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt , owe something of their extraordinary garrulity to " the irreparable outrage . " This book begins , with almost the highest possible promise for us , in a Discussion of the Rise of Criticism , its various species , The Philosophical , Historical , and Corrective , &c.; It goes Philological on hardly less promisingly , if the mere chapter-headEnquiries. ings are taken , with discourses on Numbers , Composition , Quantity , Alliteration , &c.; ; the Drama , its Fable and its Manners , Diction , and , at the end of the second part , an impassioned defence of Rules . But the Third , which promises a discussion of " the taste and literature of the Middle Age , " raises the expectation almost to agony-point . Here is what we have been waiting for so long : here is the great gap going to be filled . At last a critic not merely takes a philosophic-historic view of criticism , but actually proposes to supplement it with an inquiry into those regions of literature on which his predecessors have turned an obstinately blind eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the aggravation of the disappointment . Harris 's first part , though by no means illplanned , is very insufficiently carried out , and the hope of goodness in the third is cruelly dashed beforehand by the // sentence , " At length , after a long and barbarous period , when the shades of monkery began to retire , " &c.; The writer 's mere enumeration of Renaissance critics is very haphazard , and his remarks , both on them and their successors , perfunctory in the extreme . lie hardly dilates on anybody or anything except ? following the tradition from Pope and Swift ? on Bentley and his mania for correction and conjecture . In the second part he gives himself more room , and is better worth reading , but the sense of disappointment continues . In ? fact , Harris is positively irritating . He lays it down , for instance , that " nothing excellent in a literary way happens merely by chance , " a thesis from the discussion of which much might come . But he simply goes off into a loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a good many examples in which the excellence of his precept , " seek the cause , " is more apparent than the success of his own researches . The rest is extremely discursive , and seldom very satisfactory , being occupied in great part with such tenth-rate stuff as Lillo 's Fatal Curiosity . As for Harris 's defence of the Rules , he does not , in fact , defend them at all ; but , as is so common with controversialists , frames an indictment , which no sensible antagonist would ever bring , in order to refute it . He says that " he never knew any genius cramped by rules , and had known great geniuses miserably err by neglecting them . " A single example of this last would have been worth the whole treatise . But Harris does not give it . Finally , " the Taste and Literature of the Middle Age " seem to him to be satisfactorily discussed by ridiculing the Judgment of God , talking at some length about Byzantine writers , giving a rather long account of Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Athens and Constantinople , introducing " the Arabians , " with anecdotes of divers caliphs , saying something of the Schoolmen , a little about the Provencal poets , something ( to do him justice ) of the rise of accentual prosody , ' and a very , very little about Chaucer , Petrarch , Mandeville , Marco Polo , Sir John Fortescue , and ? Sannazar ! " And now having done with the // Middle Age , " he concludes ? having , that is to say , shown that , except a pot-pourri of mainly historical anecdote , he knew nothing whatever about it ; or , if this seem harsh , that his knowledge was not of any kind that could possibly condition is judgment of literature favourably . In fact , no one shows hat curious eighteenth-century confusion of mind , which may be noticed frequently in other countries , better than Harris . He is , as we have seen , a fervent devotee of the Rules ? he believes l that , before any examples of poetry , there was an abstract schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Epigram , which you can not follow but to your good , and can not eglect but to your peril . Yet , on the one hand , he feels the philosophic impulse , and on the other , the literary and historical curiosity , before which these rules were bound to vanish . A few allusions , 2 in contemporaries of abiding fame , have kept half alive the name ? though very few , save specialists , are likely to be otherwise than accidentally acquainted with the work ? of John Brown of Newcastle , author of of the once famous Estimate of the Manners and Principles of the Times , ' and afterwards , when he had gained reputation by this , of a Dissertation on the Rise f Poetry and Music , 4 later still slightly altered , and rechristened History of the Rise and Progress of Poetry . ' The Jest lmate itself is one of those possibly half - unconscious pieces of quackery which from time to time put ( in a manner which somehow or other tickles the longer ears among their Contemporaries ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Denmark . There is not much in it that is directly literary ; the chief point of the kind is an attack on the Universities : it may be noted that quacks generally do attack Universities . The Dissertation-History is a much less // claptrap piece , but far more amusing to read . Brown is one of those rash but frank persons who attempt creation as well as criticism ; and those who will may hear how " Peace on Nature 's lap reposes why not vice versa ? Pleasure strews her guiltless roses , " and so forth . The difference of the two forms is not important . In the second , Brown simply left out Music , so far as he could , as appealing to a special public only . He believes in Ossian , then quite new . He thinks it contains " Pictures which no civilised modern could ever imbibe in their strength , nor consequently could ever throw out " ? an image so excessively Georgian ( putting aside the difficulty of imbibing a picture ) that one has to abbreviate comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wallows , in the naturalistic generalisation of his century . He begins , of course , with the Savage State , lays it down that , at religious and other festivals , men danced and sang , that then organised professional effort supplemented unorganised , and so poets arose . Then conies about a sort of Established Choir , whence the various kinds are developed . And we have the Chinese ? the inevitable Chinese ? Fow-hi , and Chaohao , and all their trumpery . Negligible as an authority , Brown perhaps deserves to rank as a symptom . But we must leave minorities , and come to him who is here o ecryas . There is no reason to doubt that Johnson 's critical opinions were formed quite early in life , and by that mixture of natural bent and influence of environment which , as a rule , forms all such opinions . There has been a tendency . to regard , as the highest mental attitude , that of considering everything as an open question , of being ready to reverse any opinion at a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have record of not many men who have proceeded in this way ; and it may be doubted whether among them is a single person of first-rate genius , or even talent . Generally speaking , the men whose genius or talent has a " stalk of Carle hemp " in it find , in certain of the great primeval creeds of the world , political , ecclesiastical , literary , or other , something which suits // their bent . The bent of their time may assist them in fastenbig on to this by attraction or repulsion ? it really does not lunch matter which it is . In either case they will insensibly , from an early period , choose their line and shape their course accordingly . They will give a certain independence to it ; they will rarely be found merely " swallowing formulas . " It is the other class which does this , with leave reserved to get rid of the said formulas by a mental emetic and swallow another set , which will very likely be subjected to the same fate . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson was in most things a Tory by nature , his Toryism being conditioned , first by that very strong bent towards a sort of transcendental scepticism which many great Tories have shown ; secondly , by the usual peculiarities of social circumstance and mental constitution ; and lastly , by the state of England in his time ? a state to discuss which were here impertinent , but which , it may be humbly suggested , will not be quite appreciated by accepting any , or all , of the more ordinary views of the eighteenth century . His view of literature was in part determined by these general influences , in part ? perhaps chiefly ? by special impinging currents . His mere birth-time had not very much to do with it ? Thomson , Dyer , Lady Winchelsea , who consciously or unconsciously worked against it , were older , in the lady 's case touch older , than he was ; Gray and Shenstone , who consciously worked against it in different degrees , were not much younger . ' The view was determined in his case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite inexplicable , but also by other things explicable enough . Johnson , partly though probably not wholly in consequence of his near sight , was entirely insensible to the beauties of nature ; he made fun of " prospects " ; he held that " one blade of grass is like another " ( which it most certainly is not , even in itself , let alone its surroundings ) ; lie liked human society in its most artificial form ? that provided by towns , clubs , parties . In the second place , his ear was only // less deficient than his eye . That he did not care for music , in the scientific sense , is not of much importance ; but it is quite clear that , in poetry , only an extremely regular and almost mathematical beat of verse had any chance with him . Thirdly , lie was widely read in the Latin Classics , less widely in Greek , still more widely in the artificial revived Latin of the Renaissance and the seventeenth century . ' Fourthly , he was , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ranged from Macrobius in youth to Parismus and Parismenus in age , and from Travels in Abyssinia to Prince Titi ? not very widely read either in medieval Latin or in the earlier divisions of the modern languages ; indeed , of these last he probably knew little or nothing . Fifthly , the greatest poet in English immediately before his time , and the greatest poet in English during his youth and early manhood , had been exponents , the one mainly , the other wholly , of a certain limited theory of English verse . Sixthly , the critical school in which he had been brought up was strictly neo-classic . Seventhly , and to conclude , such rebels to convention as appeared in his time were chiefly men whom he regarded with unfriendly dislike , or with friendly contempt . Nor can it be said that any one of the contemporary partisans of " the Gothick " was likely to convince a sturdy adversary . Walpole was a spiteful fribble with a thin vein of genius ; 2 Gray a sort of Mr Facing-Both-Ways in literature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson 's own , and whose dilettante shyness and scanty production invited ridicule . Both were Cambridge men ( and Johnson did not love Cambridge men , nor they him ) , and both were Whigs . Percy and Warton were certainly not very strong as originals , and had foibles enough even as scholars . But whether these reasons go far enough , or do not so go , Johnson 's general critical attitude never varies in the least.2 It was , as has been said , prob- // ably formed quite early ; it no doubt appeared in those but dimly known contributions to periodical literature which defrayed so ill the expense of his still more dimly known first twenty years in London . We have from him no single treatise , iii the cases of Dante and Longinus , no pair of treatises , as in he case of Aristotle , to go upon . But in the four great documents of The Rambler , Rasselas , the Shakespeare Preface , and e Lives , we see it ? in the two first rigid , peremptory , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last conditioned by differences which allow it somewhat freer play , nd at some times making a few concessions , but at others more pugnacious and arbitrary than before . The critical element in The Rambler is necessarily large ; but great deal of it is general and out of our way ) . Directly concerning us are the papers on the aspects ( chiefly formal ) of Milton 's poetry ? especially versification on which Addison had not spoken , with some smaller papers ti lesser subjects . The Miltonic begins at No. 86 . Johson is as uncompromising as the great Bysshe himself on nature of English prosody . " The heroick measures of the English language may be properly considered as pure or mixed . " hey are pure when " the accent rests on every second syllable rough the whole line . " In other words , " purity " is refused anything but the strict iambic decasyllable . Nay , he goes ruler ; this is not only " purity " and " the completest harmony possible , " but it ought to be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a ( verse ) paragraph . Nevertheless , for variety 's sake , the " mixed " measure is lowed ; " though it always injures the harmony of the line considered by itself , " it makes us appreciate the " harmonious " as better . And we soon perceive that even this exceedingly // grudging , and in strictness illogical , licence is limited merely to substitution of other dissyllabic feet for the pure iamb . In " Thus at their shady lodge arrived , both stood , ! loth owned , " the rigid Johnson insists on the spondaic character , " the accent is on two syllables together and both strong " ; while he would seem to regard " And when , " in the line " And when we seek as now the gift of sleep , " as a pyrrhic ( " both syllables are weak " ) . A trochee ( " deviation or inversion of accent " ) is allowed as a " mixture " in the first place , but elsewhere is " remarkably inharmonious , " as , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soft wings of peace cover him round . " The next paper ( SS ) passes , after touching other matters , to " elision , " by which he means ( evidently not even taking trisyllabic possibility into consideration ) such a case as " Wisdom to folly as nourishment to wind . " This licence , he says , is now disused in English poetry ; and adds some severe remarks on those who would revive or commend it . He even objects to the redundant ending in heroic poetry . In the third paper ( 90 ) he comes to Pauses ; and once more plays the rigour of the game . The English poet , in connecting one line with another , is never to make a full pause at less than three syllables from the beginning or end of a verse ; and in all lines pause at the fourth or sixth syllable is best . He gives a whole paper to Milton 's accommodation of the sound to the sense , and winds up his Miltonic exercitations , after a very considerable interval , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , partly on its general character as an Aristotelian tragedy ( he decides that it has a beginning and end , but no middle , poor thing ! ) and partly on details . These papers show no animus against Milton . There are even expressions of admiration for him , which may be called enthusiastic . But they do show that the critic was not in range with his // Author . Almost every one of his axioms and postulates is uestionable . Of the remaining critical papers in the Rambler it is very important to notice No. 121 , " On the Dangers of Imitation , and the Impropriety of imitating Spenser . " Johnson 's acuteness was not at fault in distrusting , from his int of view , the consequences of such things as the Castle of ndolence or even the Schoolmistress ; and he addresses a direct . huke to " the men of learning and genius " who have introduced the fashion . ' In so far as his condemnation of " echoes " goes he is undoubtedly not wrong , and he speaks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parrhesia 2 which , like many other things in him , shows his true critical power . Buton Spenser himself the other idols ? the idola specus rather than on ? blind him . In following his namesake in the condemnation of Spenser 's language he is , we may think , wrong ; yet this at least is an arguable point . But in regard to the Spenserian stanza things are different . Johnson calls it " at once difficult and unpleasing ; tiresome to the ear from its uniformity , and to the attention by its length , " while he subsequently goes off into the usual error about imitating the Italians . No truce is here possible . That the Spenserian is not easy may be granted at ce , but Johnson was certainly scholar enough to anticipate e riposte that , not here only , it is " hard to be good . " As for " unpleasing , " so much the worse for the ear which is not pleased by the most exquisite harmonic symphony in the long and glorious list of stanza-combinations . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . While as for the Italian parallel , nothing can probably be more to the glory of Spenser than this ; just as nothing can be more different than the pretty , not cloying , rhyme even of Tasso , nay , sometimes even of Ariosto , an d the endless unlaboured beauty of Spenser 's rhyme-sound. // It is no valid retort that this is simply a difference of taste . If a man , as some men have clone , says that Spenser is pleasing and Dryden and Pope are not , then the retort is valid . When the position is taken that both rhythms are pleasing , both really poetical , hut poetical in a different way , the defender of it may laugh at all assailants . The criticism of the English historians which immediately follows has an interest chiefly of curiosity , because it was written just at the opening of the great age of the department with which it deals . Prejudices of different kinds would always have prevented Johnson from doing full justice to Robertson , to Hume , and , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , he deals with nobody later than Clarendon , and merely throws back to Raleigh and Knolles . Very much the same drawback attends the criticism on Epistolary writing : for here also it was the lot of Johnson 's own contemporaries , in work mostly not , written , and hardly in a single case published , at the ( late of the Rambler , to remove the reproach of England . But the paper on Tragi-Comedy ( 156 ) is much more important . For here , as in other places , we see that Johnson , but for the combination of influences above referred to , might have taken high , if not the highest , degrees in a very different school of criticism . He puts the great rule Nec quartet loqui into the dustbin , with a nonchalance exhibiting some slight shortness of sight ; for the very argument he uses will sweep with this a good many other rules to which he still adheres . " We violate it , " he says coolly , " without scruple and without inconvenience . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unity of Time , while he blows rather hot and cold about tragi-comedy in the sense of the mixing of tragic and comic scenes . But the close of the paper is the most remarkable , for it is in effect the death-knell of the neo-classic system , sounded by its last really great prophet . " It ought to be the first endeavour of a writer to distinguish nature from custom , or that which is established because it is right from that which is right only because it is established ; that he may neither violate essential principles by a desire of novelty , nor debar himself from the attainment of beauties within his view by a needless fear // of breaking rules which no literary dictator had authority to enact . " " Oh ! the lands of Milnwood , the bonny lands of Milnwood , that have been in the name of Morton twa hundred years ; they are barking and fleeing , infield and outfield , haugh and holme ! " With this utterance , this single utterance , all the ruling doctrines of sixteenth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' The well-known " Dick Minim " papers in the Idler ( 60 , 61 ) are excellent fun , and perhaps Johnson 's chief accomplishment in the direction of humour . The growth of criticism in Dick , his gradual proficiency in all the critical commonplaces of his day ( it is to be observed that Johnson , like all true humourists , does not spare himself , and makes one of Minim 's secrets de Polichinelle a censure of Spenser 's stanza ) , his addiction to Johnson 's pet aversion , " suiting the sound to the sense , " and his idolatry of Milton , are all capitally done . Indeed , like all good caricatures , the piece is a standing piece to consult for the fashions and creeds which it caricatures . But it neither contains nor suggests any points of critical doctrine that we can not find elsewhere , and it is only indirectly serious.2 The Dissertation upon Poetry of Imlac in Rasselas ( chap . x. ) may be less amusing ; but it is of course much more serious . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Johnson 's self as he chose to put , and could put , in character : while it is at least possible that his sentiments are determined in some degree by the menacing appearances of Romanticism . Imlac finds " with wonder that in almost all countries the most ancient poets are reputed the best " ; that " early writers are in possession of nature and their successors of art " ; that " no man was ever great by imitation " ; that he must observe everything and observe for himself , but that he // must do it on the principle of examining , " not the individual , but the species . " He is to remark " general properties and large appearances . He does not number the streaks of the tulip or describe the different shapes in the verdure of the forest , " but must " exhibit prominent and striking features , " neglecting " rninuter discriminations . " In the same way his criticism of life must be abstracted and generalised ; he must be " a being superior to time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must by incessant practice of style " familiarise to himself every delicacy of speech and grace of harmony . " Surely a high calling and election ! yet with some questionable points in it . If the poet must not count the streaks of the tulip , if he must merely generalise and sweep ; if he must consult the laziness and dulness of his readers by merely portraying prominent and striking features , characteristics alike obvious to vigilance and carelessness ? then even Dryden will not do , for he is too recondite and conceited . Pope alone must bear the bell . Lady Winchelsea 's horse in twilight , the best part of a century earlier ; Tennyson 's ashbuds in the front of March , the best part of a century later , are equally " streaks of the tulip , " superfluous if not even bad . Habington 's picture of the pitiless northern sunshine on the ice-bound pilot , and Keats 's of the perilous seas through the magic casements , must be rejected , as too unfamiliar and individual . The poetic strangeness and height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? these are the keys to the poetical kingdom of heaven . The tenant of Milnwood has a fresh enfeoffinent ! The Shakespeare Preface is a specially interesting document , because of its illustration , not merely of Johnson 's native critical vigour , not merely of his imbibed eighteenth- century prejudices , but of that peculiar position of compromise and reservation which , as we have said and shall say , is at once the condemnation and the salvation of the English critical position at this time . Of the first there are many instances , though perhaps none in the Preface itself quite equal to the famous note on the character of Polonius , which has been generally and justly taken as showing what // a triumph this failure of an edition might have been . Yet oven here there is not a little which follows in the wake of Dryden 's great eulogy , and some scattered observations of the highest acuteness , more particularly two famous sentences which , though Johnson 's quotation is directed to a minor matter ? Shakespeare 's learning ? settle beforehand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurdity of the Bacon-Shakespeare theory ) . The rest , however , is , if not exactly a zigzag of contradiction , at least the contrasted utterance of two distinct voices . Shakespeare has this and that merit of nature , of passion ; but " his set speeches are commonly cold and weak . " " What he does best he soon ceases to do . " Johnson , here also , has no superstitious reverence for the Unities , and even speaks slightly of dramatic rules ; nay , he suggests " the recall of the principles of the drama to a new examination , " the very examination which Lessing was to give it . But he apologises for the period when " The Death of Arthur was the favourite volume , " and hints a doubt whether touch of our and his own praise of Shakespeare is not " given by custom and veneration . " " He has corrupted language by every mode of depravation , " yet Johnson echoes Dryden " when he describes anything you more than see it , you feel it too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In short , throughout the piece it is now Johnson himself who is speaking , now some one with a certain bundle of principles or prejudices which Johnson chooses to adopt for the time . It was with these opinions on the formal and substantial nature of poetry and of criticism that Johnson , late in life , sat The Lives of down to the Lives of the Poets , 2 one of the most the poets . fortunate books in English literature . In very few cases have task and artist been so happily associated . For " // almost all his authors , he had biographical knowledge such as no other living man had , and the access to which has long been closed . If , now and then , his criticism was not in touch with his subjects , this was rare : and the fact gave a certain value even to the assertions that result ? for we , do what we will , can not see Milton quite as Johnson saw him , and so his view is valuable as a corrective . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school and system of English poetry , a ' school and system with which the critic was at once thoroughly familiar and thoroughly in sympathy . And , lastly , the form of the work , with its subdivision into a large number of practically independent and not individually burdensome sections , was well suited to coax a man who suffered from constitutional indolence , and who for many years had been relieved from that pressure of necessity which had conquered his indolence occasionally , and only occasionally , earlier . No other man , it is true , has had quite such a chance : but he must indeed have a sublime confidence , both iii the strength of his principles and in the conflict epee of his talents , who thinks that , if he had the chance , he could do the task better than Johnson did his . The work , of course , is by no means equal throughout : and it could not be expected to be . Some was merely old stuff ; dating from a much less mature period of the writer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on subjects so trivial that good nature , or simple indolence , or , if any one pleases , an artistic reluctance to break butterflies on so huge a wheel , made the criticisms almost as insignificant as the criticised . Here and there extra-literary prejudice ? politicalecclesiastical , as in the case of Milton ; partly moral , partly religious , and , it is to be feared , a little personal , as in that of Swift ? distorted the presentation . And it is quite possible that a similar distortion , due to the same causes or others , was in the case of Gray intensified by a half-unconscious conviction that Gray 's aims and spirit , if not his actual poetical accomplishments , were fatal to the school of poetry to which the critic himself held . But make allowance for all this , and with how great a thing do the Lives still provide us 1 In that combination of biography // and criticism , which is so natural that it is wonderful it should be so late , , they are all but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are full of anecdote , agreeably and crisply told , yet they never descend to mere gossip : their criticism of life is almost always just and sound , grave without being precise , animated by the same melancholy as that of the Vanity of Human Wishes , but in milder mood and with touches of brightness . Their criticism of literature is all the more valuable for being the criticism of their time . When we read Johnson 's remarks on Milton 's minor poems it is foolish to rave , and it is ignoble to sneer . The wise will rejoice in the opportunity to understand . So when Johnson bestows what seems to . us extraordinary and unintelligible praise on John Pomfret 's Choice , 2 he is really praising a moral tract couched in verse not unpleasing in itself , and specially pleasing to his ear . When he speaks less favourably of Grongar Hill , he is speaking of a piece of nature-poetry , not arranged on his principle of neglecting the streak of the tulip , and availing itself of those Miltonic licences of prosody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the poetry is of the stamp which he recognises , he makes any mistake about its relative excellence : and we shall find that , in not a few cases , he is able to recognise excellence which belongs to classes and schools not exactly such as he approves . And , lastly , it has to be added that for diffused brilliancy of critical expression , subject to the allowances and conditions just given , the Lives are hardly to be excelled in any language . It is not safe to neglect one of them , though no doubt there are some six or seven which , for this reason or that , take precedence of the rest . The " Cowley " has especial interest , because it is Johnson 's // only considerable attempt at that very important part of criticism , the historical summary of the characteristics of a poetical period or school . And , though far from faultless , it is so important and so interesting in its kind that it ranks with his greatest Essays . Only that singular impatience of literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthew Arnold , and which not infrequently marred his own critical work , can have prevented him from including , inu his , lolinsonian points de repere , the Essay which launched , and endeavoured to make watertight , the famous definition of the " Metaphysical " School ? of the school represented earlier by Donne , and later by Cowley himself . The phrase itself 1 has been both too readily adopted and too indiscriminately attacked . Taken with the ordinary meaning of " metaphysical , " it may indeed seem partly meaningless and partly misleading . Taken as Johnson meant it , it has a meaning defensible at least from the point of view of the framer , and very important in critical history . Johnson ( it is too often forgotten ) was a scholar ; and be used " metaphysical " in its proper sense ? of that which " conies after " the physical or natural . Now , it was , as we have seen , the whole cardinal principle of his school of criticism that they were " following nature " by imitating it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dryden calls the " last Age " ? what we call , loosely but conveniently , " Elizabethan " poetry ? was that its ideas , and still more its expressions , went beyond and behind nature , substituted afterthoughts and unreal refinements for fact . It would be delightful to the present writer to defend the Metaphysicals here ? but it would not be to the question . Political and religious prejudice accounts , as has been said , for much in the Hilton . But it will not fully account for the facts . The at first sight astonishing , and already often referred to , criticisms on the minor poems show a perfectly honest and genuine dislike to the form as well as to the matter , to the manner as well as to the man . If Johnson * JOHNSON . 22 : ; calls Lycidas " harsh , " it is because he simply does not hear its music ; he can even call the songs in Comics " not very musical in their numbers . " When of the , no doubt unequal but often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best it can only be said that they are not bad , " he gives us the real value of his criticism immediately afterwards by laying it down that " the fabric of a sonnet , however adapted to the Italian language , has never succeeded in ours . " And when he has earlier stated that " all that short compositions can commonly attain is sweetness and elegance , " we see in this the whole thing . Milton is condemned under statute ( though the statute is hopelessly unconstitutional and unjust ) on certain counts ; on others his judge , though capable and perfectly honest , does not know the part of the code which justifies the accused . Johnson is listening for coupletmusic , or for stanzas with regular recurrence of rhyme , for lines constituted entirely on a dissyllabic , or entirely on a trisyllabic , basis . He does not find these things : and he has no organ to judge what he does find . With the lives of Dryden and Pope we are clear of all difficulties , and the critic is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticising occupy the same platform as he does ; they and Pope . have in fact been themselves the architects of that platform . There is no fear of the initial incompatibilities which , when aggravated by accident , lead to the apparent enormities of the Milton Essay , and which , even when not so aggravated , condition the usefulness , though they may positively increase the interest , of the Cowley . But there is more than this . In no instance , perhaps , was Johnson so well in case to apply his biographical and critical treatment as in regard to Dryden and Pope . With the latter he had himself been contemporary ; and when he first came to London the traditions even of the former were still fresh , while there were many still living ( Southerne the chief of them ) who had known glorious John well . Further , Johnson 's peculiar habits of living , his delight in conversation and society , his excellent memory , and his propensity to the study of human nature , as well as of letters , furnished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sympathy with both , on general literary sides , was not unhappily mixed // and tempered by a slight , but not uncharitable or Puritanic , disapproval of their moral characters , by regret at Dryden 's desertion of the Anglican Church , and at the half-Romanist , half-freethinking , attitude of Pope to religion . The result of all this is a pair of the best critical Essays in the English language . Individual expressions will of course renew for us the sense of difference in the point of view . We shall not agree that Dryden " found English poetry brick and left it marble , " and we shall be only too apt to take up the challenge , " If Pope be not a poet , where is poetry to be found ? " even if we think the implied denial , to which the challenge was a reply , an absurdity . And we may find special interest as well as special difference in the condemnation even of these masters for attempting Pindarics , because Pindarics " want the essential constituent of metrical compositions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a fresh instance of that Procrustean tyranny of suiting the form to the bed , not the bed to the form , which distinguishes all neo-classic criticism . But these points occur rarely . The criticism , as a whole , is not merely perfectly just on its own scheme , but requires very little allowance on others ; nor , in the difficult and dangerous art of comparative censorship , will any example be found much surpassing Johnson 's parallel of the two poets . In the Milton and the Cowley we find Johnson dealing with schools of poetry which he regards as out of date and imperfect ; in the Dryden and the Pope , with subjects which are not to him subjects of any general controversy , but which he can afford to treat almost entirely on their merits . In the Collins and the Gray we find a new relation between poet and critic ? the relation of decided , though not yet wholly declared , innovation on the part of the poets , and of conscious , though not yet quite wide-eyed and irreconcilable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this is further differentiated by the fact that Johnson regarded Collins with the affection of a personal friend , and the generous sympathy of one who , with all his roughness , had a mind as nearly touched by mortal sorrows as that of any sentimentalist ; while it is pretty clear , though we have no positive // evidence for it , that he reciprocated the personal and political dislike which Gray certainly felt for him . The result was , in the case of Collins , a criticism rather inadequate than unjust , and not seldom acute in its indication of faults , if somewhat blind to merits ; in that of Gray , one which can not be quite so favourably spoken of , though the censure which has been heaped upon it ? notably by Lord Macaulay and Mr Arnold ? seems to me very far to surpass its own injustice . Johnson 's general summing up ? that Gray 's " mind had a large grasp ; his curiosity ' was unlimited , and his judgment cultivated ; he was likely to love much where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please " ? is acute , just , and far from ungenerous . That on the Elegy ? " The four stanzas beginning , Yet even these bones , ' are to me original ; I have never seen the notions in any other place . Yet he that reads them here persuades himself that he has always felt them . Had Gray written often thus , it had been vain to blame and useless to praise him " ? is a magnificent and monumental compliment , said as simply as " Good morning . " He is absolutely right when he says that in all Gray 's Odes " there is a kind of cumbrous splendour that we wish away , " for there never was such an abuser of " poetic diction " ( to be a poet ) as Gray was . Yet undoubtedly the Essay is not satisfactory ; it has not merely , as the Collins has , blindness , but , what the Collins has not , that obvious denigration , that determination to pick holes , which always vitiates a critique , no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the probable reasons of this are interesting . It has been said that they were possibly personal in part . We know that Gray spoke rudely of Johnson ; and there were many reasons by Johnson might rather despise Gray , though he certainly should not have called him " dull . " On the whole , however , I have little doubt ? and it is this Bich gives the essay its real interest for me ? that one main reason of Johnson 's antipathy to Gray 's poetry was the same as that for which we like it . He suspected , if he did not fully rceive , the romantic snake in Gray 's classically waving grass . // And he had on his own grounds good reason for suspecting it . Gray might use Greek and Latin tags almost extravagantly . But he sedulously eschewed the couplet ; and , while preferring lyric , he chose lyrical forms which , though Johnson was too much of a scholar to dare to call them irregular , violated his own theories of the prompt and orderly recurrence of rhyme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as even as possible . The sense of nature , the love of the despised " prospect , " was everywhere ; even the forbidden " streak of the tulip " might be detected . And , lastly , Gray had too obvious leanings to classes of subject and literature which lay outside of the consecrated range ? early English and French , Welsh , Norse , and the like . It is no real evidence of critical incapacity , but of something quite the reverse , that Johnson should have disliked Gray . He spied the great Romantic beard under the Pindaric and Horatian muffler ? and he did not like it . On the whole , it may be safely said that , however widely a man may differ from Johnson 's critical theory , he will , provided that he possesses some real tincture of the critical spirit himself , think more and more highly of the Lives of the Poets the more he reads them , and the more he compares them with the greater classics of critical literature . As a book , they have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , one may think that they have . The peculiarity of their position as a body of direct critical appraisement of the poetical work of England for a long period should escape no one . But the discussion of them , which possesses , and is long likely to possess , prerogative authority as coining from one who was both himself a master of the craft and a master of English , admirable and delightful as it is and always will be , is not , critically speaking , quite satisfactory . Mr Arnold speaks of the Six Lives which he selected in very high terms : but he rather pooh-poohs the others , and , even iii regard to the chosen Six , he puts upon himself ? and in his amiable , but for all that exceedingly peremptory , way , insists in putting on his readers ? a huge pair of blinkers . We are to regard the late seventeenth and the whole of the eighteenth century as an Age of Prose : and we are to regard Johnson , // whether he was speaking of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokesman of an age of prose . Far be it from me to deny that there is an element of truth in this : but it is not the whole truth , and the critic must strive , though he may not boast , to " find the whole . " The whole truth , as it seems to me , about Johnson is that he was very much more than the critic of an age of prose , though he was not ( who has been ? even Longinus ? even Coleridge ? ) " The King who ruled , as he thought fit , The universal monarchy of wit " as regards poetic criticism . He saw far beyond prose , as in those few words of the concluding and reconciling eulogy of ( gray which have been quoted above . It is poetry and not prose which has the gift of putting new things so that the man who reads them ingenuously thinks that they are merely a neat stateiiient of what he has always thought . And Johnson was far more than merely a critic of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most noteworthy passage in the Jeambler ( No. 156 ) , which I have purposely kept for comment in this place , though it is delivered on the wrong side , shows us , as the great critics always do show- us , what a range of sight the writer had . In this he expresses a doubt whether we ought to judge genius merely by the event , " and , applying this to ' Shakespeare , takes the odd , but for an eighteenth-century critic most tell-tale and interesting , line that if genius succeeds by Divans which are wrong according to rule , we may think higher of the genius but less highly of the work . It is hardly necessary to point out that this is , though in no way a discreditable , $ transparent evasion of the difficulty which is pressing on the defenders of the Rules . " Show me , " one may without irreverence retort , " thy genius without thy works ; and I will show thee my genius by my works . " If Shakespeare shows genius in neglecting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortune , greater than all other things save Fate , will point out that the Rules are evidently not necessary , and , with something like the Lucretian Te sequar , will add , " Then for what are they : Accessary ? " But Johnson 's power is only a little soured and // not at all quenched by this . He has seen what others refused ? perhaps were mumble ? to see , and what some flatly denied , ? that a process of literary judgment " by the event " is possible , and that its verdicts , in some respects at any rate , can not ; be challenged or reversed . These great critical apercus , though sometimes delivered half unwillingly or on the wrong side , establish Johnson 's claim to a place not often to be given to critics ; but they do not establish it more certainly than his surveys of his actual subjects . It was an unfortunate consequence of Mr Arnold 's generous impatience of all but " the chief and principal things , " and of his curious dislike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept away the minor Lives . One may not care for Stepney or Yalden , Duke or King , much more , or at all more , than he did . But with a really great member of the craft his admissions and omissions , leis paradoxes , his extravagances , his very mistakes pure and simple , are all critically edifying . How does he apply his own critical theory ? is what we must ask : and , with Johnson , 1 think we shall never ask it in vain . his idea of English poetry was the application to certain classes of subjects , not rigidly limited to , but mainly arranged by , the canons of the classical writers ? of what seemed to him and his generation the supreme form of English language and metre , brought in by Mr Waller and perfected by Mr Pope , yet not so as to exclude from admiration the Allegro of Milton and the Elegy of Gray . We may trace his applications of this , if we have a real love of literature and a real sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Pomfret as in relation to Alexander Pope . We may trace his failures ( as we are pleased , quite rightly in a way , to call them ) , the failures arising from the inadequacy , not of his genius , but of his scheme , not less agreeably iii relation to Dyer than in relation to Dryden . We are not less informed by his passing the Castle of Indolence almost sub silentio than we are by that at first sight astounding criticism of Lycidas . This C ' sar never does wrong but with just cause ? to use the phrase which was too much for the equanimity or the intelligence of his great namesake Ben , // in the work of one whom both admired yet could not quite stomach . Now , this it is which makes the greatness of a critic . That Johnson might have been greater still at other times need not necessarily be denied ; though it is at least open to doubt whether any other time would have suited his whole disposition better . But , as he is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not those who , like , for instance , Christopher North and Mr Ruskin , are at the mercy of different kinds of caprice ? with whom you must be always on the qui vivo to be certain what particular watchword they have adopted , what special ide they are taking . It may even be doubted whether such a critic as Lamb , though infinitely delightful , is exactly " great " ( cause of the singular gaps and arbitrariness of his likes and dislikes . Nay , Hazlitt , one of the greatest critics of the world n the whole , goes near to forfeit his right to the title by the occasional outbursts of almost insane prejudice that cloud his vision . Johnson is quite as prejudiced ; but his prejudice is of in the least insane . His critical calculus is perfectly sound n its own postulates and axioms ; and you have only to apply leeks and correctives ( which are easily ascertained , and kept ready ) ) to adjust it to absolute critical truth . And , what is ore , he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left us a solid reasoned body of critical judgment ; has not judged literature in the exhausted receiver of mere t , and yet has never neglected the artistic criterion ; he has pt in constant touch with life , and yet has never descended mere gossip . We may freely disagree with his judgments , t we can never justly disable his judgment ; and this is the 1 criterion of a great critic . Johnson is so much the eighteenth-century orthodox critic in quintessence ( though , as I have tried to show , in transcendence also ) that he will dispense us from saying very much more about the rank and file , the ordinary or inferior examples , of the kind . If we were able to devote the whole space of this volume to the subject of the sent chapter , there would be no lack of material . Critical oreitations of a kind formed now , of course , a regular part of // the work of literature , and a very large part of its hack-work . The Gentleman 's Magazine devoted much attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the century two regular Reviews , the Critical and the Monthly , ' were recognised organs of literary censorship , and employed some really eminent hands , notably Smollett and Goldsmith . The periodicals which , now in single spies , now ( about the middle of the century ) in battalions , endeavoured to renew the success of the Tatler and Spectator , were critical by kind ; and dozens , scores , hundreds probably , of separate critical publications , large and small , issued from the press.2 But , with the rarest exceptions , they must take the non-benefit of the old warning ? they must merely " be heard by their foreman . " Something we must say of Goldsmith ; then we may take two contrasted examples , Knox and Scott of Amwell , of the critic in Johnson 's last days who inclined undoubtingly to the classical , and of the critic of the same time who had qualms and stirrings of Romanticism , but was hardly yet a heretic . And then , reserving summary , we may close the record . // Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pen was not much less prolific in this than in other departments . But the angel is too often absent , and Poor Poll distressingly in evidence . The Inquiry into the Present , ' qnte of Polite Learning in Europe is simply " prodigious . " It is admirably written ? Macaulay owes something to its style , which lie only hardened and brazened . The author apes the fashionable philosophastering of the time , and throws in cheap sciolism like the prince of journalists that he was . It is almost always interesting ; it is , where it touches life , not literature , sometimes excellently acute ; but there is scarcely a critical dictum in it which is other than ridiculous . So in the Citizen of the World the Author 's Club is of course delightful ; but why should a sneer at Drayton have been put in the mouth of Lien Chi Altangi ? And the miscellaneous Essays , including the Bee , which contain so much of Goldsmith 's best work , are perhaps t lie best evidences of his nullity here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goldsmith 's genius ( to find such an one I confess would cost more ) to write a literary parallel to the magnificent Reverie , which would be even finer , it is enough tai draw iron tears down the critic 's cheek . Goldsmith on Taste , Poetry , Metaphor , &c.,l; is still the Goldsmith of the Inquiry . His " Account of the Augustan Age , " 2 though much better , and ( unless I mistake ) resorted to by some recent critics as a source of criticism different from that mostly prevalent in the nineteenth century , has all the limitations of its own period . And the Essay on Versification , 3 though it contains expressions which , taken by themselves , might seem to show that GoldSmith had actually emancipated himself from the tyranny of the fixed number of syllables , contains others totally irreconcilable with these , supports English hexameters and sapphics , 4 and as a whole forces on us once more the reluctant belief that be simply had no clear ideas , no accurate knowledge , on the subject . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Period . A scholar and a schoolmaster , he had some of the advantages of the first state and some of the defects of the less gracious second , accentuated in both cases by the dying influences of a " classical " tradition which had not the slightest idea that it was moribund . He carries his admiration for Pope to such a point as to assure us somewhere that Pope was a man of exemplary piety and goodness , while Gay was " uncontaminated with the vices of the world , " which is really more than somewhat blind , and more than a little kind , even if we admit that it is wrong to call Pope a bad man , and that Gay had only tolerable vices . He thinks , in his Fourteenth Essay on the " Fluctuations of Taste , " that the Augustans " arrived at that standard of perfection which , " &c.; that the imitators of Ariosto , Spenser , and the smaller poems of Milton are " pleasingly uncouth " compare Scott , infra , on the metrical renaissance of Dyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused heap of splendid ideas " ; is certain that Milton 's sonnets " bear no mark of his genius , " and in discussing the versions of " the sensible2 Sappho " decides that Catullus is much inferior to ? Philips ! " The Old English Poets Essay Thirty-Nine are deservedly forgotten . " Chaucer , Gower , Lydgate , and Occleve " seem to have thought that rhyme was poetry , and even this constituent they applied with extreme negligence " ? the one charge which is unfair against even Occleve , and which , in reference to Chaucer , is proof of utter ignorance . Patriotism probably made him more favourable to Dunbar , Douglas , and Lyndsay , thotigh he groans over the necessity of a glossary in their case also . In fact , Knox is but a Johnson without the genius . Let it , however , be counted to him for righteousness that he defended classical education , including verse - writing , against its enemies , who even then imagined vain things . John Scott of Amwell , once praised by good wits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a poet of " glimmer- // ings . " In fact , I am not at all sure that he does not deserve to be promoted and postponed to the next chapter , as a representative of the rising , not the falling , tide . His Essays on poetry i exhibit in a most interesting way the " **28;54;TOOLONG " state of public opinion about the later years of Johnson . He defends Lycidas against the Dictator ; yet he finds fault with the " daystar " for acting both as a person and an orb of radiance , and admits the " incorrectness " of the poem , without giving us a hint of the nature or authority of " correctness . " He boldly attacks the consecrated Cooper 's Hill , and sets the rival eminence of Grongar against it , pronouncing Dyer " a sublime but strangely neglected poet , " yet picking very niggling holes in this poet himself . He often anticipates , and oftener seems to be going to anticipate , Wordsworth , who no doubt owed him a good deal ; yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most concise and just definition of Poetry . " In Grongar Hill itself he thinks the " admixture of metre its second , certainly , if not its first great charm rather displeasing to a nice ear " ; and though he defends Gray against Knox , he is altogether yea-nay about Windsor Forest , and attacks Thomson 's personifications , without remembering that Gray is at least an equal sinner , and without giving the author of the Seasons , and still more of the Castle of Indolence , any just compensation for his enthusiasm of nature . In fact , Scott is a man walking in twilight , who actually sees the line of dawn , but dares not step out into it . ' 235 INTERCHAPTER III . ENGLISH Eighteenth - Century criticism has a very notable advantage over Seventeenth and Sixteenth . In the earliest of the three , as we saw , criticism exists almost without a critic . Its authorities are either men of something less ( to speak kindly ) than the first rank as men of letters , or else they devote only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Seventeenth this is not quite so , for Dryden is a host in himself . But he is also a host almost by himself : a general without an army . In the Eighteenth the case is far more altered , in regard both to persons and to methods and opportunities of treatment . Addison , Johnsen , , , Pope , are all dictators of literature , whose fame and authority , in the case at least of the first and last , go far beyond their own country ? and they are all critics . Moreover , criticism has enormously ' multiplied its appearances and opportunities of appearance : it has , in a manner , become popular . The critical Review ? the periodical by means of which it is possible , and becomes easy , to give critical account of the literature , not merely of the past but of the present ? becomes common . The critic as such is no longer regarded as a mere pedant ; he at least attempts to take his place as a literary man of the world . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the contribution of England is specially interesting as working towards a reconstruction as well as a continuation of criticism . In consequence , very mainly , of Dryden 's own magnificent championship of Shakespeare and Milton , it was , by the beginning of the eighteenth century , felt in England that these two older writers at any rate had to be reckoned // with ; while Chaucer also had the same powerful recommendation , and Spenser had never lost the affection of the fit , though for a time they might be few . With these four to be somehow or other ? by hook or by crook ? taken into consideration , it was impossible for the worst harm to be done ; and the peculiarities of the English character , combined with the more vigorous condition of English creative literature , helped the compromise to work . It might have been dangerous if Johnson had written the Lives at the age which was Pope 's when lie wrote the Essay on Criticism ; but this danger also the Fortune of England ? kindest of Goddesses , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ? averted . Still , as we saw , Neo-Classicism is undoubtedly the accepted orthodoxy of the time . If that draft confession of Faith , which has been sketched in a former page , had been laid before an assembly of the leading men of letters , not many Englishmen would have refused to accept it . At the same time ? until , towards the later years of the century , the " alarums and excursions " of the Romantic rising recalled the orthodox to strictness ? a more searching examination would have revealed serious defections and latitudinarianisms . Pope was perhaps the most orthodox neo-classic , in criticism as in creation , of the greater men of letters of the time ; but Pope was fond of Spenser . Addison had never thoroughly cleared his mind up about criticism ; but many things in him point the Romantic way , and we know that some of the more orthodox thought him weak and doubtful . And we have seen how the great Dr Samuel Johnson , though he resisted and recovered himself , was at least once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the event , " over which , when a Classic once lets himself slip , he falls for ever and for ever through the Romantic void . But all these things were as the liberalities of a securely established orthodoxy , estated and endowed , dreading no disturbance , and able to be generous to others ? even to indulge itself a little in licence and peccadillo . Everywhere but in England the vast majority of men , and even in England ss all but a very small minority , had no doubt about the , general // prjnciples of the Neo-classic Creed . They still judged by Rules and Kinds ; they still had the notion that you must generalise , always generalise ; they still believed that , in some way or other , Homer and Virgil ? especially Virgil ? had exhausted the secrets of Epic , and almost of poetry ; and , above all , they were entirely unprepared to extend patient and unbiassed judgment to something acknowledged , and acknowledging itself , to be new . On the contrary , they must still be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them to be novel , on the score of their being so very like the old ? as we saw in the case of Blair and Ossian . The Nemesis of this their Correctness , as far as creation is concerned , in prose to some extent , but still more in verse , has been described over and over again by a thousand critics and literary historians . The highest and most poetical poetry they could not write at all ? except when they had , like Collins , Smart , Cowper , and Blake , a little not merely of furor poeticus , but of actual insanity in their constitution . In their own chosen way they could at best achieve the really poetical rhetoric , but at the same time the strictly rhetorical poetry , of Pope , and , in a lower range , of Akenside . For prose they had the luck to discover , in the Novel , a Kind which , never having been to any great extent practised before , was a Kind practically without rules , and so could make or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite so new , their performance gave striking instance of their limitations . The Periodical Essay was a thing of almost infinite possibilities : but because it had happened at first to be written in a certain form by persons of genius , they turned practice into Kind and Rule once more , and for nearly the whole century went on imitating the Spectator . In Criticism itself the effects were not wholly different , though of course to some extent apparently dissimilar . We have seen how , during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , the necessary and ineluctable set of the critical current towards full and free " judging of authors " seems to have been resisted by a sort of unconscious recalcitrance on the part of critics ; yet how they are drawn nearer and nearer to it , and , in Dryden 's // case at any rate , achieve admirable results . By the eighteenth , in all countries , the tendency becomes irresistible . The interest in literature , the bent and occupations of men of letters great and small , the new institution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of critical estimate , from the elaborate literary history to the brief review , begins to be written , and is written , ever more copiously . This was what criticism wanted ; and it could not but do good . Yet the results illustrated , as mere abstract treatises never could have done , the deficiencies of the common critical theory . The writers save themselves , as a rule , from the worst mistakes by simply ignoring that of which they are ignorant . But in regard to the things with which they do deal the inadequacy and the hamper of their theory are sufficiently apparent . Of course the deficiencies of Eighteenth-century criticism are to be easily matched with other , and sometimes opposite , deficiencies in other times . It takes considerably more pains to get at something like a real appreciation of its subject , something more tlian a bare reference to schedule , than had been the case , either in ancient times or in the two centuries immediately preceding . It is very much better furnished with a critical theory ( whether good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has usually been the case with Criticism from the early years of the nineteenth century to the early years of the twentieth . It is not even intentionally ignorant ? its ignorance only proceeds from a mistaken estimate of things as worth or not worth knowing ; and there is rarely to be found in it the bland assumption which has been not entirely unknown later , that " I like this , " or perhaps rather , " I choose to say I like this , " will settle everything . But it combines , in a fashion already perhaps sufficiently illustrated , the awkwardness of dogmatism and of compromise ; and it is certainly more exposed to those two terrible questions , " Why ? " and " Why Not ? " which are the Monkir and Nakir of all critics and all criticism , than the criticism of any other period . It is difficult to see how a critic such as Dennis could give any reasons for admiring Shakespeare at all , save ethical-ones ; and it is quite // certain that a persistent Te sequar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the stock eighteenth-century objections both to Shakespeare and to all other suspected persons . The anti-Shakespearians had the advantage over their own adversaries of being at least consistent . The theory not merely of the authades kallos , the " headstrong beauty , " but of the " monstrous beauty " ? the beauty which is beautiful but has no business to be so , the miracleworking power which does work miracles , but is to be forbidden as Black Magic , because it does not work them according to the rules ? may seem itself so monstrous as to be a patent reduction to the absurd . In fact it acted as such . Yet the logic of it is undeniable . It had all along been the unspoken word , but the word that ought to have been spoken , and had to be spoken some day . Nor need we grudge the admission that it was in a certain sense better than the practice ( which had been often resorted to before , and which has not seldom been resorted to since ) of denying the beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time , honestly unable to see it . At the same time , the merits of Neo-Classicism deserve another word or two . The chief perhaps is , that it provided all orthodoxy ? and that is never a wholly bad thing . Even if it is not as really orthodox , as really right as its opponents , it has merits which they can rarely claim . It has no temptations for the clever fool , who is perhaps on the whole the most pestilent , intellectually , of human beings . It demands a certain amount of self-abnegation , which is always a good thing . It does not perhaps really offer any greater temptation to the merely stupid than does the cheap heterodoxy of other times . Above all , it directly tends to a certain intellectual calmness ? to an absence of fuss , and worry , and pother , which is certainly not one of the least characteristics of the Judge . At all times the wise man would rather be orthodox than not ; and at most times , though not quite at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they have recognised that every opinion has some amount of truth in it , and that this truth , // plus the advantages of orthodoxy just mentioned , is greatest , and should prevail . This will be recognised by all fair-minded persons as a handsome allowance in any case ; it is surely a particularly handsome allowance when the arbiter happens not to be a partisan of the orthodoxy in question . And it is quite sincere . The present writer has emerged from the serious and consecutive examination of " classical " critics , necessary for the writing of this History , with a distinctly higher opinion of them generally , with a higher opinion in most cases in particular , than he held previously on piecemeal and imperfect acquaintance . Yet if we take the true reading of illud Syrianum , " Judex damnatur capitis cum innocens culpatur vel minime , " then the case of the criticism with which we have been dealing becomes somewhat parlous . It is all the worse because its worsening is gradual and continuous . The sins of the earliest Renaissance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a rule aggravated by commission ; while its merits are very great . We could have done nothing without it : at best we should have had to do for ourselves all that it has done for us . But the bad side of the matter betrays itself in the code-making of the seventeenth century ; it is but imperfectly and unsatisfactorily disguised in the compromises of the earlier eighteenth ; and it appears in all its deformity in its late eighteenth-century recrudescence , the worst faults of which were seen rather in France than in England , but which were not absent in such men as Knox or Gifford , or even in Johnson sometimes . And these faults came from the absence of a wide enough collection of instances from the past , and of an elastic and tolerant system of trial and admission for the present and future . The compiling , in however piecemeal and haphazard a way , of such a collection , and the construction , under whatever similar limitations , of such a system , were the necessary conditions precedent to what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Criticism . Both these terms may be much controverted : but the controversies are rather too // general for the present volume . We have already seen what its predecessor was , in general , and that in the usual general , gradual , incalculable way , opposition to it , conscious or unconscious , began to grow up at different times and in different places . This opposition was a plant of early though slow and fitful growth in England , but it does not follow that we can put the finger on this and that person as having " begun " the new movement . Such an opinion is always tempting to not too judicious inquirers , and there has been no lack of books on " Romanticism in the Classics , " and the like . The fact , of course , simply is that everything human exists essentially or potentially in the men of every time ; and that you may not only find books in the . running brooks but ( what appears at first more contradictory ) dry stones in them : while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the midst of the driest rock . Indagation of the kind is always treacherous , and has to be conducted with a great deal of circumspection . It would be difficult to find an author who illustrates this danger and treachery better than the case of Butler ( who for that reason has been postponed for treatment here ) on Dryden , Rymer , Denham , and the cavalier poet Benlowes . The author of Hudibras was born not long after Milton , and nearly twenty years before Dryden , who outlived him by the same space . His great poem did not give much room for critical utterances in literature ; but the Genuine Remains 1 are full of it in separate places , both verse and prose . Take these singly , and you may make Butler out to be , not merely a critic , but half a dozen ritics . In perhaps the best known of his minor pieces , the epartees between Cat and Puss , he satirises " Heroic " Plays , and is therefore clearly for " the last age , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Modern Plays precisely by the Rules of the Ancients , " which has been reasonably , or // certainly , thought to be directed against Rymer 's blasphemy of Beaumont and Fletcher , published two years before Butler 's death . The satirist 's references and illustrations ( as in that to " the laws of good King Howel 's days " ) are sometimes too Caroline to be quotable ; but the force and sweep of his protest is simply glorious . The Panegyric on Sir John Denham is chiefly personal ; but if Butler had been convinced that Cooper 's Hill was the ne plus ultra of English poetry he could hardly have written it : and though the main victim of " To a Bad Poet " has not been identified , ' the lines " For so the rhyme be at the verse 's end , No matter whither all the rest does tend " could scarcely have been written except against the new poetry . The " Pindaric Ode on Modern Critics " is chiefly directed against the general critical vice of snarling , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow suit . But if we had only the verse Remains we should be to some extent justified in taking Butler , if not for a precursor of the new Romanticism , at any rate for a rather strenuous defender of the old . But turn to the Characters . Most of these that deal with literature are in the general vein which the average seventeenth - century character - writer took from Theophrastus , though few put so much salt of personal wit into this as Butler . In " A Small Poet " the earlier pages might be aimed at almost anybody from Dryden himself ( whom Butler , it is said , did not love ) down to Flecknoe . But there is only one name mentioned in the piece ; and that name , which is made the object of a furious and direct attack , lightened by some of the brightest flashes of Butler 's audacious and acrid humour , is the name of Edward Benlowes ? Now , that Benlowes is a person // taillable et corveable et merci et a misericorde by any critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is as extravagant as Crashaw without so much poetry , and as Cleveland without so much cleverness . But he is a poet , and a " metaphysical " poet ( as Butler was himself in another way ) , and an example , though a rather awful example , of that " poetic fury " which makes Elizabethan poetry . Yet Butler is more savage with him than with Denham . The fact is that Butler 's criticism is merely the occasional determination of a man of active genius and satiric temper to matters literary . Absurdities strike him from whatever school they come ; and he lashes them unmercifully whensoever and whencesoever they present themselves . But he has no general creed : he speaks merely to his brief as public prosecutor of the ridiculous , and also as a staunch John Bull . If he had been writing at the time when his Remains were first actually published , it is exceedingly probable that he would have " horsed " Gray as pitilessly as he horses Benlowes ; if he had been writing sixty years later still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tartarly " to Keats and Shelley , or seventy years later , to Tennyson , as the Quarterly itself . This is not criticism : and we must look later and more carefully before we discern any real revolution in literary te . It is even very unsafe to attempt to discover much definite and intentional precursorship in Addison , who was born two full generations later than Butler . There is no need to repeat hat has been said of what seems to me misconception as to is use of the word Imagination : nor is this the point which is principally aimed at here . But the more we examine Addison 's ritical utterances , whether we agree with Hurd or not that hey are " shallow , " we shall , I think , be forced to conclude that y depth they may have has nothing to do with Romanticism . ddison likes Milton , no doubt , because he is a sensible man d a good critic , as a general reason . But when we come to vestigate special ones we shall find that he likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupil of Dryden , and a religious an ? nay , perhaps even because he really does think that // Milton carries out the classical idea of Epic ? than because of Milton 's mystery , his " romantic vague , " his splendour of diction and verse and imagery . So , too , the admiration of Chevy Chase is partly a whim or a joke , partly determined by the fact that at that time the Whigs were the " Jingoes , " and that Chevy Chase is very pugnacious and very patriotic . Nowhere , from the articles on True and False Wit to the Imagination papers , do we find any real sense of unrest or dissatisfaction with the accepted theory of poetry . There is actually more in Prior , with all his profanation of the Nutbrowne Maid and his distortions of the Spenserian stanza . And Dryden himself , Dryden whose method led straight to the Promised Land , and whose utterances show that he occasionally saw it afar off , came too early to feel any very conscious desire of setting out on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , readers will rarely find sharp and decided turns , assignable to definite hours and particular men . It is a part of the Neo-classic error itself to assume some definite goal of critical perfection towards which all things tend , and which , when you have attained it , permits you to take no further trouble except of imitation and repetition . Just as you never know what new literary form the human genius may take , and can therefore never lay down any absolute and final schedule of literary kinds , and of literary perfection within these kinds , so you can never shape the set of the prevalent taste , and you can never do much more than give the boat the full benefit of the current by dexterous rowing and steering . Indeed , as we have seen , the taste in criticism and the taste in creation unite , or diverge , or set dead against each other in a manner quite incalculable , and only interpretable as making somehow for the greater glory of Literature . Somewhere about the time to which we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries , or a little later , or much later , as the genius of different countries and persons would have it ? a veering of the wind , an eddy of the current , did take place . And it is of this and of its consequences we have now to give an account . 245 CHAPTER V. . WE have already , in the last chapter , said that in England , about the middle of the eighteenth century , the tables of criticism rned , and that a company of critics , not large , not as a rule ery great men of letters , began slowly , tentatively , with a groat deal of rawness , and blindness , and even backsliding , to grope for a catholic and free theory of literature , and especially of poetry . We are now to examine this group 1 more narrowly With the not quite certainly to be allowed exception of Gray // no one of them could pretend to the first rank in the literature of the time ; and most of them ( Hurd and Percy were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even at the extreme verge of life , the advent of the champions who were to carry their principles into practice . But they were the harbingers of the dawn , little as in some cases ( perhaps in all ) they comprehended the light that faintly and fitfully illuminated them beforehand . Three of the writers of this class whom it is necessary to name here have been alluded to already ; the others were Shenstone and the Wartons . As so often happens in similar cases , it is exceedingly difficult to assign exact priority , for mere dates of publication are always misleading ; and in this case , from their close juxtaposition , they almost of themselves give the warning that they are not to be trusted . How early , in his indolent industry at Cambridge , Gray had come to a Pisgahsight of the true course of English poetry ; Shenstone , in pottering and maundering at the Leasowes , to glimpses of the same ; Percy and Shenstone again to their design , afterwards executed by Percy alone , of publishing the Reliques ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side and Spenser on the other ; Hurd to his curious mixture of true and false apercus , ? it is really impossible to say . The lastnamed , judging all his work together , may seem the least likely , early as some of that work is , to have struck out a distinctly original way for himself ; but all , no doubt , were really driven , nolentes volentes , conscious or unconscious , by the Time-Spirit . The process which the Spirit employed for effecting this great change was a simple one ; indeed , we have almost summed up his inspiration in the oracular admonition , Antiguan exquirite matrem . For more than two hundred years literary criticism had been insolently or ignorantly neglecting this mother , the Middle Age ? now with a tacit assumption that this period ought to be neglected now with an open and expressed scorn of it . But , as usually // happens , a return had begun to be made just when the opposite progress seemed to have reached its highest point . Dryden himself had " translated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chase . But before the death of Pope much larger and more audacious explorations had been attempted . In Scotland ? whether consciously stung or not by the disgrace of a century almost barren of literature ? Watson the printer 1 and Allan Ramsay 2 had , in 1706 ? 11 and 1724-40 , unearthed a good deal of old poetry . In England the anonymous compilers of the Ballads of 1723 had done something , and Oldys the antiquary , under the shelter of " Mrs Cooper 's " petticoat , had done more with the Muses ' Library of 1737 . These examples 4 were followed out , not without a little cheap contempt from those who would be in t he fashion , and knew not that this fashion had received warning . But they were followed , and their most remarkable result , in criticism and creation combined , is the work of Gray . We have not so very many fairer figures in our " fair " herd than Gray , though the fairness may be somewhat like that of Crispa , 5 visible chiefly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , in proportion , scantier even than his poetical ; and the scantiness may at first sight seem even stranger , since a man can but poetise when he can , but may , if he has the critical faculty , criticise almost when he will and has the opportunity . That opportunity ( again at first sight ) Gray may seem to have had , as scarcely another man in our whole long history has had it . He had nothing else to do , and was not inclined to do anything else . He had sufficient means , no professional avocations , the knowledge , the circumstances , the locale , the wits , the taste , even the velleity ? everything but , in the full sense , the will . This indeed he might , in all // circumstances and at all times , have lacked , for Mr Arnold showed himself no philosophic student of humanity when the , said that at the date of Milton , or at the date of Keats , Gray would have been a different man . His work would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another matter . At all times , probably , Gray would have had the same fastidiousness , the same liability to be " put off " ; and if his preliminary difficulties had been lightened by the provision , in times nearer our own , of the necessary rough-hewing and first research by others , yet this very provision would probably have prevented him from pursuing what he would have disdainfully regarded as a second-hand business . We may ? we must ? regret that he never finished that History of English Poetry which he hardly began , that he never attempted the half-dozen other things of the kind , which he was better equipped for doing than any man then living , and than all but three or four men who have lived since . But the regret must he tempered by a secret consciousness that on the whole he probably would not have done them , let time and chance and circumstance have favoured him never so lavishly . Yet this very idiosyncrasy of limitation and hamper in him made , in a sense , for criticism ; inasmuch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which could be spared . There is the eager , strenuous , almost headlong critical disposition of a Dryden , which races like a conflagration ' over all the field it can cover ; and there is the hesitating , ephectic , intermittent temperament of a Gray , which directs an intense and all-dissolving , but ill-maintained heat at this and that special part of the subject . In what is called , and sometimes is , " originality , " this latter temperament is perhaps the more fertile of the two , and Gray has it in an almost astounding measure . Great as was his own reading , a man might , I think , be as well read as himself without discovering any real indebtedness of his , except to a certain general influence of literary study in many times and tongues . He knew indeed , directly or . indirectly , most of the other agents in the quiet and gradual revolution which was coming on English poetic and literary taste ; but he // was much in advance of all of them in time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think , cites Gravina , in whom there was something to put him on new tracks ; and though he was at least equally well read in French , and does cite Fontenelle , it is not for any of the critical germs which may be discovered in that elusive oracle . The one modern language to which he seems to have paid little or no attention was German , 1 where the half-blind strugglings of the Zurich school might have had some stimulus for him . Whatever he did , alone he did it ; and though the volume of his strictly critical observations ( not directed to mere common tutorial scholarship ) would , if printed consecutively , perhaps not fill twenty ? certainly not fifty ? pages of this book , its virtue , intrinsic and suggestive , surpasses that of libraries full not merely of Rymer but of ( critical ) Popes . From the very first these observations have , to us , no uncertain sound . In a letter to West , ' when the writer was about six-and-twenty , we find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority that " the language of the age is never the language of poetry except among the French , whose verse , where the thought or image does not support it , differs nothing from prose , " with a long and valuable citation , illustrating this defence of " poetic diction , " and no doubt thereby arousing the wrath of Wordsworth . Less developed , but equally important and equally original , is the subsequent description of our language as not being " a settled thing " like the French . Gray , indeed , makes this with explicit reference only to the revival of archaisms , which he defends ; but , as we see from other places as well as by natural deduction , it extends to reasonable neologisms also . In this ' respect Gray is with all the best original writers , from Chaucer and Lagland downwards , but against a respectably mistaken body of critics who would fain not merely introduce the caste system into English , but , like // Sir Boyle Roche , make it hereditary in this caste not to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's best-known criticisms , in his faint praise of Joseph Andrews and his warm appreciation of Marivaux and Crebillon . I am not quite certain that , in this last , Gray intended any uncomplimentary comparison , or that he meant anything more than a defence of the novel generally ? a defence which itself deserves whatever crown is appropriated to critical merit , inasmuch as the novel had succeeded to the place of Cinderella of Literature . However , both Fielding and Smollett were probably too boisterous for Gray , who could appreciate Sterne better , though he disliked " Tristram 's " faults . But the fact is that it is not in criticisms of his contemporaries , or indeed in definite critical appreciation at all , that Gray 's strength lies . For any defects in the former he has , of course , the excuse that his was a day of rather small things in poetry ; but , once more , it is not quite certain that circumstances would have much altered the case . We must remember that Mr Arnold also does not come very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second variety of the critical temperament which we have defined above is not conducive to enthusiasm . ' It is , of course , unlucky that Gray 's personal affection for Mason directed his most elaborate praises to a tenth-rate object ; but it is fair to remember that he does reprehend in Mason faults ? such as excessive personification ? which were not merely those of his friend , the husband of " dead Maria , " but his own . It is a thousand pities that , thanks to Mason himself , we have the similar criticisms of Beattie only in a garbled condition ; but they too are sound and sensible , if very merciful . The mercy , however , which Gray showed perhaps too plentifully to friends and relations he did not extend to others . That the " frozen grace " of Akenside appealed little to him is less remarkable than his famous pair of judgments on Joe " Warton and Collins . // The coupling itself , moreover , and even the prophecy that " neither will last , " are less extraordinary ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the firm perspective of the past ; " will err in this way , and Joseph 's Odes are , as his friend , Dr Johnson , said of the rumps and kidneys , " very pretty little things " ) than the ascription of " a bad ear " to Collins . This is certainly " a term inexplicable to the Muse . " It was written in 1746 . Five years later an undated but clearly datable letter to Walpole contains ( lxxxiv. , ed. cit. ) in a notice of Dodsley 's Miscellany , quite a sheaf of criticisms . That of Tickell ? " a poor short-winded imitator of Addison , who had himself not above three or four notes in poetry , sweet enough indeed , like those of a German flute , but such as soon tire and satiate the ear with their frequent return " ? is very notable for this glance backward on the great Mr Addison , though it would have been unjust to Tickell if ( which does not quite appear ) it had been intended to include his fine elegy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cadogan . ' Gray is quite amiable to The Spleen and The Schoolmistress , and London ; justly assigns to Dyer ( the Dyer of Grongar Hill , not of The Fleece ) " more of poetry in his imagination than almost any of our number , " but unjustly calls him " rough and injudicious , " and brushes most of the rest away , not too superciliously . A year later ( December 1752 , to Wharton ) he grants to Hall 's Satires " fulness of spirit and poetry ; as much of the first as Dr Donne , and far more of the latter . " In the elaborate " buckwashing " of Mason 's Caractacus ode , which occupies great part of the very long letter of December 19 , 1756 , there is a passage of great importance on Epic and Lyric style , which exhibits as well perhaps as anything else the independence , and at the same time the transitional consistency , of Gray 's criticism . He says first ( which is true , and which no rigidly orthodox Neo-Classic would or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with all its flights of fancy ornaments , heightening of expression , and harmony of sound , is in its nature superior to every other style . " Then he says that this is just the cause why it could not be borne in a work of great length ; then // that the epic " therefore assumed graver colours , " and only stuck on a diamond borrowed from her sister here and there ; then that it is " natural and delightful " to pass from the graver stuff to the diamond , and then that to pass from lyric to epic is to drop from verse to mere prose . All of which seems to argue a curious inequality in clearing the mind from cant . It is true , as has been said , that Lyric is the highest style . But surely the reason why this height can not be kept is the weakness , not of human receptivity but of human productiveness . Give us an Iliad at the pitch of the best chorus of the Agamemnon , and we will gladly see whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can pass from the dress to the diamond , why not pass from the diamond to the dress ? It is true that in Mason 's case the diamonds were paste , and bad paste ; but that does not affect the argument . When , in still a later letter ( clxii. ) to the same " Skroddles " 1 he lays it down that " extreme conciseness of expression , yet pure , perspicuous , and musical is one of the grand beauties of lyric poetry , " we must accentuate one of the . But there is a bombshell for Neo-Classicism in cvii. , still to " Skroddles . " " I insist that sense is nothing in poetry , but according to the dress she wears and the scene she appears in . " Gray 's attitude to Ossian is interesting , but very much what we should have expected . He was bribed by its difference from the styles of which he was weary ; but he seems from the very first to have had qualms ( to which he did some violence , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its genuineness . No intelligent lover of the classics , whose love is not limited to theca , can fail to regret that by very far the larger bulk of Gray 's critical Observations is directed to Aristo- phanes and Plato . The annotator is not incompotent , and the annotated are supremely worthy of his labours ; but the work was not specially in need of doing , and there have been very large numbers of men as GRAY . 253 well or better qualified to do it . Such things as this ? Aves , 1114 : " These were plates of brass with which they shaded the heads of statues to guard them from the weather and the birds " ? are things which we do not want from a Gray at all . They are the business of that harmless drudge , the lexicographer , in general , of a competent fifth-form master editing the play , in particular . But there was probably at that time not a single man in Europe equally qualified by natural gifts and by study to deliver really critical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes of English , and the like . Nor has there probably at any date been any man better qualified for this , having regard to the conditions of his own time and country . One can not , then , but feel it annoying that a life , not long but by no means very short , and devoted exclusively to literary leisure , should have resulted , as far as this special vocation of the author is concerned , in nothing more than some eighty small pages of Dissertation devoted to English metres and to the Poems of Lydgate . Let us , however , rather be thankful for what we have got , and examine it , such as it is , with care . In the very first words of the Metrum it is curious and delightful to see a man , at this early period , cutting right and left at the error of the older editors , who calmly shoved in , or loft out , words and syllables to make what they thought correct versification for Chaucer , and at the other error committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's syntax , accidence , and orthography were as precise as those of a writer in the school of the French Academy . Even more refreshing are , on the one hand , his knowledge and heed of Puttenham , and , on the other , his correction of Pattenham 's doctrine of the fixed Caesura , his admissions of this in the case of the Alexandrine , and his quiet demonstration that the admission of it in the decasyllable and octosyllable would make havoc of our best poetry . The contrast of this reasonable method and just conclusion , not merely with the ignorant or overbearing dogmatism of Bysshe half a century earlier , but with the perversity , in the face of light and knowledge , of Guest a century later , is as remarkable as anything in the history of English criticism . // Gray , of course , was fallible . He entangles himself rather on the subject of " Biding Rhyme " ; and though he , first ( I think ) of all English writers , notices the equivalenced dimeter iambics of Spenser 's Oak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he goes wrong by saying that this is the only English metre in which such a liberty of choice is allowed , and more wrong still in bringing Donne 's well-known ruggedness under this head . And he does not allow himself to do more than glance at the Classical-metre craze , his remarks on which would have been very interesting . His subsequent analysis of " measures , " with the chief books or poems in which they are used , is of very great interest , but as it is a mere table it hardly lends itself to comment , though it fills nearly twenty pages . The conclusion , however , is important , and , without undue guessing , gives us fair warrant for inferring that Gray would have had much ( and not a favourable much ) to say on the contemporary practice he describes if the table had been expanded into a dissertation . And the table itself , with its notes , shows that though his knowledge of Middle English before Chaucer was necessarily limited , yet he knew and had drawn right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Owl and the Nightingale , the early English Life of St Margaret , and the Poema Morale ? . His observations on " the pseudo-Rhythmus " ( which odd and misleading term simply means Rhyme ) , with the shorter appendices on the same subject , present a learned and judicious summary of the facts as then known . The criticism on John Lydgate which closes Gray 's critical dossier might have been devoted to a more interesting subject , but they enable us to see what the average quality of the History would have been . And they certainly go , in scheme and quality , very far beyond any previous literary history of any country with which I am acquainted . The article ( as we may call it ) is made up of a // judicious mixture of biography , account of books ( in both cases , of course , as far as known to the writer only ) , citation , exposition of points of interest in subject , history , manners , &c.,; criticisms of poetical characteristics in the individual , and now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject . In one place , indeed , Gray does.introduce Homer in justification of Lydgate : but no one will hesitate to do this now and then ; and it is quite clear that he does not do it from any delusion as to a cut-and-dried pattern , or set of patterns , to which every poem , new or old , was bound to conform . And to this we have to add certain facts which , if not critical utterances , speak as few such utterances have done ? the novelty of Gray 's original English poetry , and his selection of Welsh and Scandinavian originals for translation and imitation . These things were themselves unspoken criticism of the most important kind on the literary habits and tastes of his country , and of Europe at large . The , to us , almost unintelligible puzzlement of his contemporaries ? the " hard as Greek " of the excellent Garrick , and the bewilderment of the three lords at York races , establish 1 the first point ; as for the second , it establishes itself . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever previously ; 2 they were now not merely admitted to literary attention , but actually allowed and invited to exercise the most momentous influence on the costume , the manners , the standards of those literatures which had previously alone enjoyed the citizenship of Parnassus . Small , therefore , as is the extent of deliberate critical work which Gray has left us , we may perceive in it nearly all the notes of reformed , revived , we might almost say reborn , criticism . The two dominants of these have been already dwelt upon ? to wit , the constant appeal to history , and the readiness to take new matter , whether actually new in time , or new in the sense of having been hitherto neglected , on its own // merits ; not indeed with any neglect of the ancients ? for Gray was saturated with " classical " poetry in every possible sense of the word , with Homer and Virgil , as with Dante and Milton and Dryden ? but purely from the acknowledgment at last of the plain and obvious truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deduction from these two we note , as hardly anywhere earlier , a willingness to take literature as it is , and not to prescribe to - it what it should be ? in short , a mixture of catholicity with tolerance , which simply does not exist anywhere before . Lastly , we may note a special and very particular attention to prosody . This is a matter of so much importance that we must ' ourselves bestow presently some special attention upon it , and may advantageously note some other exercitations of the kind at the time or shortly afterwards . Of the rest of the group mentioned above , Shenstone 2 is the earliest , the most isolated , and the least directly affected by the mediaeval influence . Yet he , too , must have It it to have engaged , as we know he did , with Percy in that enterprise of the Reliques which his early death cut him off from sharing fully . From his pretty generally known poems no one need have inferred much tendency of the kind in him : for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burlesque as of discipleship in it . Nor are indications of the kind extremely plentiful in his prose works . But the remarkable Essays on Men and Manners , which give a much higher notion of Shenstone 's power than his excursions into the rococo , whether versified or hortulary , are full of the new germs . Even here , however , he is , after the prevailing manner of his century , much more ethical than literary , and shows deference , if not reverence , to not a few of its literary idols . The mixed character of his remarks // on Pope 1 ( which are , however , on the whole very just ) may be set down by the Devil 's Advocate to the kind of jealousy commonly entertained by the " younger generations who are knocking at the door " ; and his objection to the plan of Spenser is neo-classically purblind . But his remarks on Prosody 2 breathe ' a new spirit , which , a little later , we shall be able to trace in development . His preference for rhymes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cat " and " not " ; his discovery ? herald of the great Coleridgean reaction ? that " there is a vast beauty in emphasising in the eighth and ninth place a word that is virtually a dactyl " ; the way in which he lays stress on harmony of period and music of style as sources of literary pleasure ; and above all the fact , that when examining the " dactylic " idea just given , he urges the absurdity of barring trisyllabic feet in any place , and declares that a person ignorant of Latin can discern Virgil 's harmony , ? show us the new principles at work . Perhaps his acutest critical passage is the maxim , " Every good poet includes a critic : the reverse will not hold " ; his most Romantic , " The words ' no more ' have a singular pathos , reminding us at once of past pleasure and the future exclusion of it . " 8 Shenstone 's colleague in the intended , his executor in the actual , scheme of the Reliques was allowed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At no time , per haps , has Bishop Percy had quite fair play . In his own day his friend Johnson laughed at him , and his enemy // Ritson attacked him with his usual savagery . In ours the publication at last of his famous Folio Manuscript 1 has resulted in a good deal of not exactly violent , but strong language as to his timorous and eclectic use of the precious material ho had obtained , and his scarcely pardonable tamperings with such things as he did extract . Nobody indeed less one-sided and fanatical than Ritson himself , or less prejudiced than the great lexicographer , could ignore the vastness of the benefit which theReliques actually conferred upon English literature , or the enormous influence which it has directly and indirectly exercised ; but there has been a slight tendency to confine Percy 's merits to the corners of this acknowledgment . Yet there is much more , by no means always in the way of mere allowance , to be said for Percy than this . His poetic taste was not perfect : it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain not wholly contemptible faculty for producing as well as for relishing verse , and an itch for exercising this ; while he suffered , as everybody did till at least the close of his own life , from failing entirely to comprehend the late and rather decadent principle that you must let ruins alone ? that you must not " improve " your original . But a man must either be strangely favoured by the gods , or else have a real genius for the matter , who succeeds , at such a time and in such circumstances , in getting together and publishing such a collection as the Reliques . Nor are Percy 's dissertations destitute of critical as well as of instinctive merit . Modern scholarship ? which has the advantage rather of knowing more than Percy could know than of making a better use of what it does know , and which is much too apt to forget that the scholars of all ages are ? Priests that slay the slayer And shall themselves be slain " can find , of course , plenty of errors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ancient Drama , the metre of Piers Plowman , and the Romances ; and they are all unnecessarily adulterated with theories and fancies about origin , &c.; But this last adulteration has scarcely ceased to be a favourite // " form of competition " among critics ; while I am bound to say that the literary sense which is so active and pervading in Percy seems to have deserted our modern philologists only too frequently . At any rate , whatever may be his errors and whatever his shortcomings , the enormous , the incalculable stimulus and reagency of the Reliques is not now matter of dispute ; while it is equally undeniable that the poetical material supplied was reinforced by a method of historical and critical inquiry which , again with all faults , could not fail to have effects almost equally momentous on criticism if not quite so momentous on creation . The two Wartons and Hurd gave still more powerful assistance in this latter department , while Thomas Warton at least supplied a great deal of fresh actual material in his History . To none of the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been recently done ; while to one of them it seems to me that there has been done very great injustice . The main documents which we have to consider in the case of the two brothers are for Joseph , his Essay on Pope ( 1756-71 ) , and the numerous critical papers in The Adventurer ; for Thomas , the Observations . on The Faerie Queene ( 1754 ) , and of course The History of English Poetry ( 1774-81 ) . Warton 's Essay on Pope 1 ? vaguely famous as a daring act of iconoclasm , and really important as a document in the Romantic Revolt ? almost literally anticipates the jest of a . hundred years later on another document , about " chalking up No Popery ! ' and then running away . " It also shows the uncertainty of standpoint which is quite pardonable and indeed inevitable in these early reformers . To us it is exceedingly unlucky that Warton should at page ii . of his Preface ask , " What traces has Donne of pure poetry ? " Yet when we come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very nearly true statement that Boileau is no more poetical than La Bruyere , we see that Warton was thinking only of the satirist , not of the author of The Anniversaries and the " Bracelet " poems . // Further , Warton lays down , sans phrase and with no Addisonian liniitat ions , that " a poet must have imagination . " 110 is sure ( ice may feel a little more doubtful ) that Young , his dedicatee , would not insist on being called a poet on the strength of his own Satires . And he works himself up to the position that in Pope there is nothing transcendently sublime or pathetic , supporting this by a very curious and for its time instructive division of English poets into four classes . The first contains poets of the first rank on the **27;84;TOOLONG standard , and is limited to three ? Spenser , Shakespeare , and Milton . The second company ? headed by Dryden , but including , not a little to our surprise , Fenton ? has less of this poetic intensity , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The third is reserved for those ? Butler , Swift , Donne , Dorset , &c.?who,; with little poetry , have abundant wit ; and the fourth " gulfs " the mere versifiers , among whom we grieve to find Sandys and even Fairfax herded with Pitt and Broome . There is evidently , both in its rightgoings and its shortcomings , considerable matter in this for discussion , were . such discussion in place . But the main heads of it , which alone would be important , must be obvious to every one . In the body of the Essay , Warton , as was hinted above , rather " hedges . " He maintains his position that Pope was not transcendently a poet ; and indulges in much detailed and sometimes rather niggling criticism of his work ; but readmits him after a fashion to a sort of place in Parnassus , not quite " utmost , last , provincial , " but , as far as we can make out , on the fence between Class Two and Class Three . The book , as has also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also drifting . The Time-Spirit is carrying the man along , but he is carried half-unconsciously . Warton 's Adventurer essays are specially interesting . They were written early in 1753-54 , some years before the critical period of 1760-65 , and two or three before his Pope essay ; and they were produced at the recommendation , if not under the direct editorship , of Johnson . Further , in the peroratorical remarks which were usual with these artificial periodicals , Warton explains that they were planned with a definite intention .
