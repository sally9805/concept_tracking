txt The world is indebted to the United States for the great boon of cheaper cabling . And it is to be remarked that It comes as a gift from a combination which , before the application of the light of reason , was under suspicion of being a combination in restraint of trade , and is even now under prosecution in some jurisdictions . The point is worth remarking because , until the way was shown , the world did not know how easy it was and was struggling toward the same result in very different ways . At the present moment the British Empire is considering subsidizing an " all red " cable , for reasons of politics as well as commerce similar to those which animated the United States in building the Panama CanaL For long years Mr. Hulk:x=11 HEATON has sought to reduce cable tolls by Government ownership of all cables to be operated at lower rates in hope of profit , but regardless of monetary results . Now appears an American " trust " which solves the problem almost offhand , at its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a profit , which it is to be hoped it will be allowed to enjoy If realized . The chances would seem to be In its favor , so great is the waste of present methods of doing business . The capacity of the cables under the Atlantic is 800 , - 000,000 words , and only 12,000,000 are sent at the old rates . Some 130 , - 000,000 of people are directly tributary - to these cables , and an uncertain num ... ber of millions more are connected ! ' with the cables through the land lines . ' Vet not one family in one hundred cables on the average one word a year . This uncultivated field is now to be worked on the theory of the American trusts that total profits can be enlarged by diminishing the rate of profit . It is the utilizing of by-products which has enabled many large traders to operate at a profit where smaller traders are unable to live . The by-product of the telegraph business is the enormous and neglected field of unsent long-distance social business . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background there is a competitor , the Marconi wireless , doing a large business , with capacity for growth limited only by the imagination , and by the business sense which revolted at the consideration of an economic capacity only one-twelfth utilized . There is good feeling toward all these competitors for public favor , since each of them has deserved well of the public . Each of them is sure of patronage commensurate with the attractiveness of the terms on which it is sought . But neitlier law nor public favor will go so far as to protect any of them from economic results . It is hoped that the " war " will not be to the death , and that it will be conducted with all the amenities . A reduction of price , even an excessive reduction , is no ground for sympathy for the competitor who wishes later to raise rates . Just as railways defeated stage coaches , and Just as bridges In this neighborhood bankrupted the ferries , so the idea of reduction of cable tolls is entitled to be tried without impediment by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic grounds , and not on malice toward a rival . Important as cheap communication is , the issue of individualism against collectivism is more important , and is directly involved . Government intervention might have provided the new rates by a subsidy , that is by levying the cost on others than those who pay the bills . But that is a crude , costly way . It would not have stimulated the brain which produced the wireless system , nor would have it produced the combination of resources which makes it possible to conduct the business on its own revenue . State owned , State supported , or state operated enterprises have rarely justified themselves economically . The search for a profit ? not always in money  --  has given the world the greatest boons it has enjoyed , and on the justest terms , that is on the basis of payment by those who receive the benefit . We are now learning that cheapness may be induced , but can not be commanded , and that prosecution of combination merely because of combination , or because of alleged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wholesome in many ways , but it Is not the surest road to . a reduction of prices . Railway rates are the steadiest - prices we have , and it is the trust rates which are the weakest in the whole list . The case of the cable tolls epitomizes almost the entire philosophy of the anti-trust mania .
