HEN Abraham Lincoln went to Washington in 1861 , to be inaugurated as President , he took with him as secretaries two young men from Springfield , Illinois ? John G. Nicolay and John Hay . The latter had graduated at Brown University three years before with a reputation for literary talents . He had a quick observation , an alert and curious mind , and ' a winning nature . His sense of humor was keen , and he showed , even at the age of twenty-two , poise and reasonableness which stood by him through life . For four years John Hay was Lincoln 's daily companion . He lived in the White House . He not only helped Nicolay to conduct the official correspondence , but he shared the President 's confidences . For amusement , . when the rush of his work did not prevent him , he kept a diary , and this diary is the most intimate record ? a series of snap-shotsof Abraham Lincoln that posterity can ever have . It contains Lincoln 's words jotted down at the moment : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young secretary ; his oddities and humorous characteristics as well as his noble qualities , sketched by a sympathetic hand . In the following paper I have assembled from John Hay 's diary what Lincoln thought at the time of several of the Union generals during the Civil War , and 1 have added here and there Hay 's own views , because we may take it for granted that he told them to the President and so contributed to the stock of evidence on which Lincoln based his decisions . Among Hay 's many memoranda on generals , battles , and military gossip none are so important and none so interesting as those on McClellan . From July 26 , 1861 , the day when , at the President 's summons , McClellan reached Washington , he was the topic of conversation to which everybody turned . He immediately took charge of organizing into a fighting . army the volunteers who were pouring into the capital at the rate of a regiment a day . For that work he possessed uncommon ability , to which was added the knowledge gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular service , and from inspection of the European armies . He not only knew what was to be done , but he had the art of persuading everybody that he was the only man who could do it . His self-esteem , by nature abnormally developed , swelled at last into an elephantiasis of the ego . But among the hesitations , perplexities , and gropings of the summer of 186r the value of McClellan 's self-assurance was quite as great as that of his technical competence . The Army of the Potomac , mulded under his direction , felt for him an enthusiasm bordering on infatuation and proof against the disillusion of subsequent defeats . Truth to tell , from the day he came to Washington McClellan was in danger of being smothered by adulation . The North , frantic for a general to avenge its defeats and to put down secession , believed that in him it had the man . It imputed to him qualities he never possessed ; it magnified his undoubted points of excellence ; it sought for happy parallels and propitious signs to confirm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " Little Mac " ; Napoleon was young and self-reliant , so was " Little Mac " : what could be more logical than to continue the parallel until it led to a Marengo and an Austerlitz for " Little Mac " ? McClellan was a Democrat ; and this enhanced his importance , because it advertised to the world that the Northern Democrats would stand by the Union . President Lincoln welcomed McClelIan 's coming , and , besides giving him every aid in formit ; the army , deferred to his plans and methods . Hay , who had a young man 's impatience at too obtrusive conceit , was present at many of their interviews , and seems very early to have doubted " Little Mac 's " omniscience . On October 22 , 1861 , Hay writes that the President and the General talked over the death of Colonel Baker at Leesburg . McClellan says : " There is many a good fellow that wears the shoulder-strapsgoing under the sod before the thing is over . There is no loss too great to be repaired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President , you will put another man immediately in my shoes . " " I want you to take care of yourself , " said the President . McClellan seemed very hopeful and confident ? thought he had the enemy , if in force or not . During this evening 's conversation ' Hay adds ' it became painfully evident that he had no plan nor the slightest idea of what Stoner was about . In those early days the President used to call informally at McClellan 's office to inquire how the work was going or to make suggestions . At one of these casual calls , on October loth , McClellan said : " I think we shall have our arrangements made for a strong reconnoissance about Monday , to feel the strength of the army . I intend to be careful and to do as well as possible . Do n't let them hurry me is all I ask . " " You shall have your own way in the matter , I assure you , " said the President , and went home . That refrain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the burden of McClellan 's talk and despatches throughout his service . A few days later , traversing Senator B. F. Wade 's opinion that an unsuccessful battle was preferable to delay , since a defeat could easily be repaired by the swarming recruits , McClellan declared that he " would rather have a few recruits after a victory than a good many after a defeat . " Lincoln regretted the popular impatience , but held that it ought to be reckoned with . " At the same time , General , " he said , " you must not fight till you are ready . " " 1 have everything at stake , " said the General ; " if 1 fail , I will not see you again or anybody . " " I have a notion to go out with you , and stand or fall with the battle , " Lincoln replied . On November 1st McClellan succeeded Gen. Winfield Scott in command of the army . The President , in thanking him , said : " I should be perfectly satisfied if I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It is a great relief , sir ! I feel as if several tons were taken from my shoulders to-day . I am now in contact with you and the Secretary . I am not embarrassed by intervention . " " Well , " says the President , " draw on me for all the sense I have , and all the information . In addition to your present command , the supreme command of the army will entail a vast labor upon you . " " I can do it all , " McClellan said , quietly . Hay evidently felt that this sublime self-assertion spoke for itself . On November 1 rth he notes that McClellan promises to " feel " the rebels on the next day ? the first of many such promises . His entry for November 13th reads : I wish here to record what I consider a portent of evil to come . The President , Governor Seward , and I went over to McClellan 's home to-night . The servant at the door said the General was at the wedding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We went in , and after we had waited about an hour McClellan came in , and without paying particular attention to the porter , who told him the President was waiting to sec him , went up-stairs , passing the door of the room where the President and Secretary of State were seated . They waited about half an hour , and sent once more a servant to tell the General they were there ; and the answer came that the General had gone to bed . I merely record this unparalleled insolence of epaulettes without comment . It is the first indication I have yet seen of the threatened supremacy of the military authorities . Coming home I spoke to the President about the matter , but he seemed not to have noticed it specially , saying it was better at this time not to be making points of etiquette and personal dignity . At the end of the following January , Hay records that the President " stopped going to McClellan 's , and sent for the General to come to him . " In March , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to allow him to retain command of the Army of the Potomac , and thus to give " him an opportunity to retrieve his errors . " At the Cabinet council at which the President announced this purpose all the members present heartily concurred in wishing that McClellan might be got rid of altogether . Seward Hay says spoke very bitterly of the imbecility which had characterized the General 's operations on the Potomac . Here follow extracts from Hay 's brief notes to Nicolay , absent from Washington , to whom he wrote as confidentially as in his diary : March 31 , 1862 , ? Little Mac sails to-day for down-river . He was in last night to see Tycoon ' . He was much more pleasant and social in manner than formerly . He seems to be anxious for the good opinion of everyone . Thursday morning April 34 ? McClellan is in danger , not in front , but in rear . The President is making up his mind to give him a peremptory order to march . It is disgraceful to think how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , April 4 , . r862 , ? McClellan is at last in motion . He is now moving on Richmond . The secret is very well kept . Nobody out of the Cabinet knows it in town . April 9 , 1862 , ? Glorious news comes borne on every wind but the South Wind . While Pope is crossing the turbid and broad torrent of the Mississippi in the blaze of the enemy 's fire , and Grant is fighting the overwhelming legions of Buckner at Pittsburg , the Little Napoleon sits trembling before the handful of men at Yorktown , afraid either to fight or run . Stanton feels devilish about it . He would like to remove him , if he thought it would do . ? At last the time came when even Lincoln 's patience was exhausted . After McClellan 's long series of blunders on the Peninsula he was superseded by Pope , who at the end of August , 862 , prepared to strike the Confederate army . On August 3oth , when Jackson and Longstreet were thrashing Pope at Bull Run , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln . 1 One of Hay 's nicknames for President Lincoln . We talked he says about the state of things by Bull Run , and Pope 's prospect . The President was very outspoken in regard to McClellan 's present conduct . He said that really it seemed to him that McClellan wanted Pope defeated . He mentioned to me a despatch of McClellan 's in which he proposed , as one plan of action , to " leave Pope to get out of his own scrape and devote ourselves to securing Washington . " He also spoke of McClellan 's dreadful panic in the matter of Chain Bridge , which he had ordered blown up the night before , but which order had been countermanded ; and also of his incomprehensible interference with Franklin 's corps , which he recalled once , and then , when they had been sent ahead by Halleck 's order , begged permission to recall them again ; and only desisted after Halleck 's sharp injunction to push them ahead until they whipped something or got whipped themselves . The President seemed to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite are probably a better explanation of his present conduct . He is constantly sending despatches to the President and Halleck asking what is his real position and command . He acts as chief alarmist and grand marplot of the army . Halleck , on the contrary , the President said , had no prejudices . He " is wholly for the service . He does not care who succeeds or who fails , so the service is benefited . " Later in the day we were in Halleck 's room . Halleck was at dinner , and Stanton came in while we were waiting for him , and carried us off ' to dinner . A pleasant little dinner and a pretty wife as white and cold and motionless as marble , whose rare smiles seemed to pain her . Stanton was loud about the McClellan business . He was unqualifiedly severe upon IVIeClellan . He said that after these battles there should be one court-martial , if never any more . He said that nothing but foul play could lose us this battle , and that it rested with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly in Pope . So did the President , for that matter . How unanimously the Cabinet distrusted McClellan appears further in this hit of conversation which Hay had with Seward on September 5 , 1862 . " Mr. Hay , " said the Secretary of State , " what is the use of growing old You learn something of men and things , but never until too late to use it . I have only just now found out what military jealousy is . . . . The other day I went down to Alexandria and found General McClellan 's army landing . I considered our armies united , virtually , and thought them invincible . I went home , and the first news I received was that each had been attacked , and each , in effect , beaten . It never had occurred to me that any jealousy could prevent these generals from acting for their common fame and the welfare of the country . " I said it never would have seemed possible to me that one American general should write of another to the President , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own scrape his own way . " He answered : " I do n't see why you should have expected it . You are not oId . I should have known it . " He said this gloomily and sadly . Nevertheless , after Pope 's defeat at the second battle of Bull Run the President concluded that McClellan must be restored to the command of the Army of the Potomac . " He has acted badly in this matter the President admitted to Hay , but we must use what tools we have . There is no man in the army who can man these fortifications and lick these troops of ours into shape half as well as he . " I spoke of the general feeling against McClellan as evinced by the President 's mail . He rejoined : " Unquestionably he has acted badly toward Pope . He wanted him to fail . That is unpardonable . But he is too useful just now to sacrifice . " At another time he said : " IF he ca n't fight himself , he excels in making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " once more led the Army of the Potomac ; not for long , however , because after his virtual failure at Antietam ( September 17 , 1862 ) and his allowing Stuart to ride round the Army of the Potomac and raid Chambersburg , popular clamor demanded his dismissal . And Lincoln , the long-suffering , convinced that the time had come , relieved him . Two years later McClellan was the Democratic nominee for President . On September z5 , 1864 , Hay records that a letter had just come from Nicolay , who was in New York , stating that Thurlow Weed , the dominant Republican leader in New York State , with whom Nicolay was to confer , had gone to Canada . When Hay showed the President the letter he said : " I think I know where Mr. Weed has gone . I think he has gone to Vermont , not Canada . I will tell you what he is trying to do . I have not as yet told anybody . " And then Lincoln proceeded to unfold the following story of a remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to me ' on business of importance , ' he said . I fixed an hour and he came . His name is Smith . He is , though you would not think it . a cousin of Baldy Smith . ' Baldy is large , blond , florid . The Governor is a little , dark sort of man . This is the story he told me , giving Gen'l Baldy Smith as his authority : " When Gen'l McClellan was here at Washington in 186-2 B. Smith was very intimate with him . They had been together at West Point , and friends . McClellan had asked for promotion for Baldy from the President , and got it . They were close and confidential friends . When they went down to the Peninsula their same intimate relations continued , the General talking freely with Smith about all his plans and prospects , until one day Fernando Wood and one other Democratic politician from New York appeared in camp and passed some days with McClellan . " From the day this took place Smith saw , or thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reserve . After a little while he mentioned this to McClellan , who , after some talk , told Baldy he had something to show him . He told him that these people who had recently visited him had been urging him to stand as an opposition candidate for President ; that he had thought the thing over and had concluded to accept their propositions , and had written them a letter ( which he had not yet sent ) giving his idea of the proper way of conducting the war , so as to conciliate and impress the people of the South with the idea that our armies were intended merely to execute the laws and protect their property , etc. , and pledging himself to conduct the war in that inefficient , conciliatory style . " This letter he read to Baldy , who , after the reading was finished , said earnestly : General , do you not see that looks like treason , and that it will ruin you and all of us ? ' After some further talk the General destroyed the letter in Baldy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and friendly counsel . After this he was again taken into the intimate confidence of McClellan . " Immediately after the battle of Antietam , Wood and his familiar came again 1- Gen. William F. Smith , the eminent Union commander . and saw the General , and again Baldy saw an immediate estrangement on the part of McClellan . He seemed to be anxious to get his intimate friends out of the way and to avoid opportunities of private conversation with them . Baldy he particularly kept employed on reconnoissances and such work . One night Smith was returning from some duty he had been performing , and , seeing a light in McClellan 's tent , he went in to report . He reported and was about to withdraw when the General requested him to remain . After every one was gone he told him those men had been there again and had renewed their proposition about the Presidency : that this time he had agreed to their proposition , and had written them a letter acceding to their terms and pledging himself to carry on the war in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there to Baldy Smith . " Immediately thereafter B. Smith applied to be transferred from that army . At very nearly the same time other prominent men asked the same ? Franklin , Burnside , and others . " Now that letter must be in the possession of F. Wood , and it will not be impossible to get it . Mr. Weed has , I think , gone to Vermont to see the Smiths about it . " Hay continues : 1 was very much surprised at the story and expressed my surprise . 1 said I had always thought that McClellan 's fault was a constitutional weakness and timidity , which prevented him from active and timely exertion , instead of any such deep-laid scheme of treachery and ambition . The President replied : " After the battle of Antietam I went up to the field to try to get him to move , and came back thinking he would move at once . But when I got home he began to argue why he ought not to move . I peremptorily ordered him to advance . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river . It was nine days longer before he got his army across , and then he stopped again , delaying on little pretexts of wanting this and that . I began to fear he was playing false ? that he did not want to hurt the enemy . I saw how he could intercept the enemy on the way to Richmond . 1 determined to make that the test . if he let them get away I would remove him , He did so , and I relieved him . I dismissed Major K. for his silly , treasonable talk because I feared it was staff talk , and I wanted an example , The letter of Buell furnishes another evidence in support of that theory . And the story you have heard Neill tell about Governor Horatio Seymour 's first visit to McClellan all tallies with this story . " The Last reference to McClellan in this diary occurs on November II , 1864 , at the first meeting of the Cabinet after Lincoln 's overwhelming re-election . The President brought out a sealed paper , which he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Hay opened it they found it contained a brief memorandum in which Lincoln stated that , as it was extremely probable that he could not be re-elected , he intended " so to co-operate with the President-elect as to save the Union between the election and the inauguration . " " I resolved , " he now told his Cabinet , " in case of the election of Gen'l McClellan , .. . that I would see him and talk matters over with him . I would say , ' General , the election has demonstrated that you are stronger , have more influence with the American people than I. Now let us together ? you with your influence , and I with all the executive power of the government ? try to save the country . You raise as many troops as you possibly can for this final trial , and I will devote all my energy to assisting and finishing the war . Seward said : " And the General would answer you , ' Yea , yes ' ; and the next day , when you saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say , ' Yes , yes ' ; and so on for ever , and would have done nothing at all . " " At least , " added Lincoln , " I should have done my duty and have stood clear before my own conscience . " With that characteristic expression the record closes ? a record which reveals Lincoln as invincibly patient , fair , and considerate toward even the general who caused him and the upholders of the Union so many poignant disappointments . General Hooker was another commander toward whom his contemporaries and posterity have had their reserves . Since the military history of the war has come to be studied dispassionately , Chancellorsville has risen into front rank among the critical battles , and , as Hooker commanded at Chancellorsville and was beaten , his reputation has , logically , suffered in proportion to the giowing significance attached to that defeat . Hay , however , evidently liked Hooker ? " Fighting Joe " ? of whose talks he made several notes . On September 9 , 1863 , he dined with Wise , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in fine flow . . . . He says he was forced to ask to be relieved by repeated acts which proved that he was not to be allowed to manage his army as he thought best , but that it was to be manmuvered from Washington . He instanced Maryland Heights , whose garrison he was forbidden to touch , yet which was ordered to be evacuated by the very mail which brought his ( Hooker 's ) relief . And other such many . At dinner he spoke of our army . He says : It was the finest on the planet . He would like to see it fighting with foreigners .. . It was far superior to the Southern army in everything but one . It had more valor , more strength , more endurance , more spirit ; the Rebels are only superior in vigor of attack . The reason of this is that , in the first place , our army came down here capable of everything but ignorant of everything . It fell into evil hands ? the hands of a baby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nothing of the morale of the army . It was fashioned by the congenial spirit of this man into a mass of languid inertness , destitute of either dash or cohesion , The Prince de Join-vale , by far the finest mind I ever met with in the army , was struck by this singular and , as he said , inexplicable contrast between the character of American soldiers as integers and in mass . The one active , independent , alert , enterprising ; the other indolent , easy , wasteful , and slothful . It is not in the least singular . You find a ready explanation in the character of its original general . Hooker drank very little , not more than the rest , who were all abstemious , yet what little he drank made his cheek hot and red and his eye brighter . I can easily understand how the stories of his drunkenness have grown , if so little affects him as I have seen . He was looking very well to-night . A tall and statuesque form ? grand fighting head and grizzled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forming a strong contrast with Butterfield , who sat opposite ? a small , stout , compact man , with a closely chiseled Greek face and heavy black mustaches , like Eugene Beauliarnais . Both very handsome and very different , September roth , ? I dined to-night at Willard 's . . . . Speaking of Lee Hooker expressed himself slightingly of Lee 's abilities . He says he was never much respected in the army . In Mexico he was surpassed by all his lieutenants . In the cavalry he was held in no esteem . He was regarded very highly by General Scott . He was a courtier , and readily recommended himself by his insinuating manner to the General Scott , whose petulant and arrogant temper had driven of late years all officers of spirit and self-respect away from him . The strength of the Rebel army rests on the broad shoulders of Longstreet . He is the brain of Lee , as Stonewall Jackson was his right arm . Before every battle he had been advised with . After every battle Lee may be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little of a soldier . He naturally rests on Longstreet , who is a soldier born . When we recall that only four months earlier Hooker , having been beaten at Ch ancellorsville , boasted of successfully withdrawing his army across the river from Lee 's army , which was not pursuing , we shall find more humor in his depreciation of Lee than he intended . From the frankness with which Hooker and the others talked to Hay we may be justified in suspecting that they thought they might through him reach the President . Lincoln , who never failed to give a man credit for his good qualities , remarked to Hay , " Whenever trouble arises I can always rely on Hooker 's magnanimity . " Still another commander of the Army of the Potomac ? General George G. Meade ? comes in for some pertinent criticism in John Hay 's record . One generation remembers Meade as the resolute captain who , although appointed only three days , before , checked the invasion of the Confederate armies in the three-days battle of Gettysburg . Contemporaries , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chagrin that it failed to crush the rebellion . It is chiefly to this that Hay 's notes refer . News traveled with desperate slowness to those kept in suspense at the White House during this crisis . The battle of Gettysburg ended at dark on July 3 , 1863 ; and yet for more than a week following , doubt and hope alternated in Lincoln 's mind as to whether the Union general , Meade , would complete his victory by destroying Lee 's army . On Saturday , July 11 , 1863 , ? Hay writes : The President seemed in specially good humor to-day , as he had pretty good evidence that the enemy were still on the north side of the Potomac , and Meade had announced his intention of attacking them in the morning . The President seemed very happy in the prospect of a brilliant success . Sunday , 12th July , ? Rained all the afternoon . Have not yet heard of Meade 's expected attack . Monday , r3t1t , ? The President begins to grow anxious and impatient about Meade 's silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent the enemy from getting away by the Falling Waters if they were not vigorously attacked . . . . Nothing can save them if 11Ieade does his duty . I doubt him . He is an engineer were so cautiously and almost timidly worded ? talking about reconnoitering to find the enemy 's weak places , and other such . . . . About noon came the despatches stating that our worst fears were true . The enemy had gotten away unhurt . The President was deeply grieved . " We had them within our grasp , " he said ; " we had only to stretch forth our hands and they were ours . And nothing I could say or do could make the army move . " Several days ago he sent a despatch to Meade which must have cut like a scourge , but Meade returned so reasonable and earnest reply that the President concluded he knew best what he was doing , and was reconciled to the apparent inaction , which he hoped was merely apparent . Every day he has watched the progress of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has never been easy in his own mind about General Meade since Meade 's General Order in which he called on his troops to drive the invader from our soil . The President says : " This is a dreadful reminiscence of McClellan . The same spirit that moved McClellan to claim a great victory because Pennsylvania and Maryland were safe . The hearts of ten million people sank within them when McClellan raised that shout last fall . Will our generals never get that idea out of their heads ? The whole country is our soil . " r5th July , ? Robert Lincoln says the President is silently but deeply grieved about the escape of Lee . He said : " If I had gone up there I could have whipped them myself . " And Hay adds I know he had that idea . To picture Lincoln commanding at Gettysburg and crushing Lee 's army , and with it the rebellion , in the most significant battle of the nineteenth century , dazzles the imagination . More than one of the Union generals regarded Lincoln as possessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commander : but could he have compassed that ? On July 16th Gen'l Wadsworth came in . He said in answer to Abe 's question , " Why did Lee escape ? " " Because nobody stopped him , " rather gruffly . Wadsworth says that at a council of war of corps commanders , held on Sunday , the r2th , . on the question of fight or no fight , the weight of authority was against fighting . French , Sedgwick , Slocum , and Sykes strenuously opposed a fight . Meade was in favor of it . So was Warren , who did most of the talking on that side , and Pleasonton was very eager for it , as also was Wadsworth himself . The non-fighters thought , or seemed to think , that if we did not attack , the enemy would , and even Meade , though he was in for action , had no idea that the enemy intended to get away at once . Howard had little to say on the subject . Meade was in favor of attacking in three columns of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of doing as Stonewall Jackson did at Chancellorsville ? double up the left , and drive them down on Williamsport . I do not question that either plan would have succeeded . Wadsworth said to Hunter , who sat beside him : " General , there are a good many officers of the regular army who have not yet entirely lost the West Point idea of Southern superiority . That sometimes accounts for an otherwise unaccountable slowness of attack . " 19 July , Sunday , ? The President was in very good humnr ; . . . in the afternoon he and I were talking about the position at Williamsport the other day . He said : " Our army held the war in the hollow of their hand , and they would not close it . " Again he said : " We had gone all through the labor of tilling and planting an enormous crop , and when it was rife we did not harvest it ! " Still he added , ' I am very , very grateful to Meade for the great service he did at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln 's indefectible sense of justice ! Quite naturally , the spectacular figure of Benjamin F. Butler , the politico-military self- seeker whose acrobatic performances edified the American public during more than forty years , appears j and reappears in Hay 's journal . Hav-ing secured a commission as brigadier-general , he led the Eighth Massachusetts to Washington . On being stopped by the mob in Baltimore at the outset of the war , he lost no time in making his presence known . On April 25 , 1861 , Hay writes : " General Butler has sent an imploring request to the President to be allowed to bag the whole nest of traitorous Maryland legislators and bring them in triumph here . This the Tycoon , wishing to observe every comity , even with a recusant State , forbade . " A few months later , on November 8th , Hay copies into his diary " a cheeky letter just received " by the President . It reads as follows : MY DEAR SIR , ? Gen'l Wool has resigned . Gen'l Fremont must . Gen'l Scott has retired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , to be Major-General of the United States Army . Has anybody done more to deserve it ? No one will do more . May I rely upon you , as you may have confidence in me , to take this matter into consideration ? I will not disgrace the position . I may fail in its duties . Truly yrs. , BENJ . F. BUTLER . The President . P. S. ? I have made the same suggestion to others of my friends . Though Butler was not the first of the political warriors with whom the President had to deal , he was surpassed by none in the persistence with which he pushed his personal claims . In January , 1864 , Hay was sent by the President to South Carolina and Florida to administer the oath of allegiance to loyal Southerners . There he fell in with Butler . In the dusk of the evening he writes from Point Lookout Gen'l Butler came clattering into the room , where Marston and I were sitting , followed by a couple of aides . We had some hasty talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oath at Norfolk ; how popular it was growing ; children cried for it . . . . After drinking cider we went down to the Hudson City , the General 's flagship . His wife , niece , and excessively pretty daughter . were there at tea .... At night , after the ladies had gone off to bed ? they all said retired , but I suppose it meant the same thing in the end ? we began to talk about somequeer matters . Butler had some odd stories about physical sympathies . . . and showed a singular acquaintance with Biblical studies . At Baltimore we took a special car and came home . I sat with the General all the way and talked with him about many matters : Richmond and its long immunity . He says he can take an army within thirty miles of Richmond without any trouble ; from that point the enemy can either be forced to fight in the open field south of the city or submit to be starved into surrender .... He gave me some very dramatic incidents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confidence-men , testing his detectives , and matters of that sort . He makes more business in that sleepy little Department than any one would have dreamed was in it . Butler soon had his opportunity , but instead of taking Richmond he allowed himself , to quote General Grant 's indelible phrase , to be " bottled up , " thereby rendering his army useless . Lincoln 's estimate of Butler appears in this entry in Hay 's diary of May 21 , 1864 : Butler is turning out much as I thought he would ; perfectly useless and incapable for campaigning . .. I said to the President to-day that I thought Butler was the only man in the army in whom power would be dangerous . McClellan was too timid and vacillating to usurp ; Grant was too sound and cool-headed and unselfish ; Banks also ; Fremont would be dangerous if he had more ability and energy . " Yes , " says the American , ' " he is like Jim Jett 's brother . Jim used to say that his brother was the d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinite mercy of Providence he was also the d ? dest fool . " I close with a quotation in a very different key about a very different commander . On May 9 , 1864 , Hay re-ports : Received to-day the first despatches from Grant in the Wilderness . The President thinks very highly of what Grant has done . He was talking about it to-day with me and said : How near we have been to this thing before , and failed ! I believe if any other general had been at the head of that army , it would have ve now been on this side of the Rapidan . It is the dogged pertinacity of Grant that wins . ' Another of Hay 's familiar names For Lincoln .
