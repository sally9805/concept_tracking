From the time when on the hill of Ward , near Tara , in preChristian days , the sacrifices were burned and the Tuatha were thought to appear on Samhain , to as late as 1910 , testimony to actual appearances of the " little people " is to be found . " ' Among the usually invisible races which I have seen in Ireland , I distinguish five classes . There are the Gnomes , who are earth-spirits , and who seem to be a sorrowful race . I once saw some of them distinctly on the side of Ben Bulbin . They had rather round heads and dark thick-set bodies , and in stature were about two and one-half feet . The Leprechauns are different , being full of mischief , though they , too , are small .

In the seventeenth century the Irish peasants went about begging money and goodies for a feast , and demanding in the name of Columb Kill that fatted calves and black sheep be prepared . In place of the Druid fires , candles were collected and lighted on Hallowe'en , and prayers for the souls of the givers said before them . The name of Saman is kept in the title " Oidhche Shamhna , " " vigil of Saman , " by which the night of October 31st was until recently called in Ireland . There are no Hallowe'en bonfires in Ireland now , but charms and tests are tried . Apples and nuts , the treasure of Pomona , figure // largely in these . They are representative winter fruits , the commonest . They can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Hallowe'en gather-ing in the eighteenth century was milk in which crushed roasted apples had been mixed .

A ring is buried in it , and the one who finds it in his portion will be married in a year , or if he is already married , will be lucky . " They had colcannon , and the funniest things were found in it ? tiny dolls , mice , a pig made of china , silver sixpences , a thimble , a ring , and lots of other things . After supper was over all went into the big play-room , and dived for apples in a tub of water , fished for prizes in a basin of flour ; then there were games ? " TRANT : Hallowe'en in Ireland . A coin betokened to the finder wealth ; the thimble , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nut are baked in a cake . The ring of course means early marriage , the nut signifies that its finder will marry a widow or a widower . If the kernel is withered , no marriage at all is prophesied . In Roscommon , in central Ireland , a coin , a sloe , and a bit of wood were baked in a cake . The one getting the sloe would live longest , the one getting the wood was destined to die within the year . A mould of flour turned out on the table held similar tokens . Each person cut off a slice with a knife , and drew out his prize with his teeth . 1 After supper the tests were tried . In the last century nut-shells were burned . The best-known nut test is made as follows : three nuts are named for a girl and two sweethearts . If one burns steadily with the girl 's nut , that lover is faithful to her , but if either hers or one of the other nuts starts away , there will be no happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of a stick // hung parallel to the floor by a twisted cord which whirls the stick rapidly when it is let go . Care has to be taken not to bite the candle burning on the other end . Sometimes this test is made easier by dropping the apples into a tub of water and diving for them , or piercing them with a fork dropped straight down . Green herbs called " livelong " were plucked by the children and hung up on Midsummer Eve . If a plant was found to be still green on Hallowe'en , the one who had hung it up would prosper for the year , but if it had turned yellow or had died , the child would also die . Hemp-seed is sown across three furrows , the sower repeating : " Hemp-seed , I saw thee , hemp-seed , I saw thee ; and her that is to be my true love , come after me and draw thee .

" Red Mike " was a queer one from his birth , an ' no wonder , for he first saw the light atween dusk an ' dark o ' a Hallowe'en Eve . " When the cabbage test was tried at a party where Mike was present , six stalks were found to be white , but Mike 's was " all black an ' fowl wi ' worms an ' slugs , an ' wi ' a real bad smell ahint it .

When she had nearly finished , she expected the yarn would be held . She must ask " Who holds ? " and the wind would sigh her sweetheart 's name in at the window .

If one was turned from the door , guests or a marriage was prophesied ; if toward the door , a death . To have prophetic dreams a girl should search for a briar grown into a hoop , creep through thrice in the name of the devil , cut it in silence , and go to bed with it under her pillow . A boy should cut ten ivy leaves , throw away one and put the rest under his head before he slept . If a girl leave beside her bed a glass of water with a sliver of wood in it , and say before she falls asleep : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rescue me , " she will dream of falling off a bridge into the water , and of being saved at the last minute by the spirit of her future husband . To receive a drink from his hand she must eat a cake of flour , soot , and salt before she goes to bed . The Celtic spirit of yearning for the unknown , retained nowhere else as much as in // Ireland , is expressed very beautifully by the poet Yeats in the introduction to his Celtic Twilight . " The host is riding from Knocknarea And over the grave of Clooth-na-bare ; Caolte tossing his burning hair , And Niam calling : ' Away , come away ; " ' And brood no more where the fire is bright , Filling thy heart with a mortal dream ; For breasts are heaving and eyes a-gleam : Away , come away to the dim twilight " Arms are heaving and lips apart ; And if any gaze on our rushing band , We come between him and the deed of his hand , We come between him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host is rushing twixt night and day , And where is there hope or deed as fair ? Caolte tossing his burning hair , And Niam calling : ' Away , come away. ! " CHAPTER VIII IN SCOTLAND AND THE HEBRIDES As in Ireland the Scotch Baal festival of November was called Samhain . Western Scotland , lying nearest Tara , center alike of pagan and Christian religion in Ireland , was colonized by both the people and the customs of eastern Ireland . The November Eve fires which in Ireland either died out or were replaced by candles were continued in Scotland . In Buchan , where was the altar-source of the Samhain fire , bonfires were lighted on hilltops in the eighteenth century ; and in Moray the idea of fires of thanksgiving for harvest was kept to as late as 1866 . All through the eighteenth century in the Highlands and in Perthshire torches of heath , broom , flax , or ferns were carried about the fields and villages by each family , with the intent to cause 59 6o THE BOOK OF HALLOWE'EN good crops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunwise , to have a good influence . Brought home at dark , the torches were thrown down in a heap , and made a fire . This blaze was called " Samhnagan , " " of rest and pleasure . " There was much competition to have the largest fire . Each person put in one stone to make a circle about it . The young people ran about with burning brands . Supper was eaten out-of-doors , and games played . After the fire had burned out , ashes were raked over the stones . In the morning each sought his pebble , and if he found it misplaced , harmed , or a footprint marked near it in the ashes , he believed he should die in a year . In Aberdeenshire boys went about the villages saying : " Ge 's a peat t ' burn the witches . " They were thought to be out stealing milk and harming cattle . Torches used to counteract them were carried from west to east , against the sun . This ceremony grew into a game , when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and defended . As IN SCOTLAND 6i in the May fires of purification the lads lay down in the smoke close by , or ran about and jumped over the flames . As the fun grew wilder they flung burning peats at each other , scattered the ashes with their feet , and hurried from one fire to another to have a part in scattering as many as possible before they died out . In 1874 , at Balmoral , a royal celebration of Hallowe'en was recorded . Royalty , tenants , and servants bore torches through the grounds and round the estates . In front of the castle was a heap of stuff saved for the occasion . The torches were thrown on . When the fire was burning its liveliest , a hobgoblin appeared , drawing in a car the figure of a witch , surrounded by fairies carrying lances . The people formed a circle about the fire , and the witch was tossed in . Then there were dances to the music of bag-pipes . It was the time of year when servants changed masters or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy a holiday before resuming work . So they sang : // " This is Hallaeven , The morn is Halladay ; Nine free nichts till Martinmas , As soon they 'll wear away . " Children born on Hallowe'en could see and converse with supernatural powers more easily than others . In Ireland , evil relations caused Red Mike 's downfall ( q. v. ) . For Scotland Mary Avenel , in Scott 's Monastery , is the classic example . " And touching the bairn , it 's weel kenn 'd she was born on Hallowe'en , and they that are born on Hallowe'en whiles see main than ither folk . " There is no hint of dark relations , but rather of a clear-sightedness which lays bare truths , even those concealed in men 's breasts . Mary Avenel sees the spirit of her father after he has been dead for years . The White Lady of Avenel is her peculiar guardian . The Scottish Border , where Mary lived , is the seat of many superstitions and other worldly beliefs . The fairies of Scotland are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and streams and woods are of greater grandeur , and the character of the people more serious . It is unlucky to name the fairies , here as elsewhere , except by such placating titles as " Good Neighbors " or " Men of Peace . " Rowan , elm , and holly are a protection against them . " I have tied red thread round the bairns ' throats , and given ilk ane of them a riding-wand of rowan-tree , forbye sewing up a slip of witchelm into their doublets ; and I wish to know of your reverence if there be onything mair that a lone woman can do in the matter of ghosts and fairies ? ? be here ! that I should have named their unlucky names twice ower ! " SCOTT Monastery . " The sign of the cross disarmeth all evil spirits . " These spirits of the air have not human feelings or motives . They are conscienceless . In this respect Peter Pan is an immortal fairy as well as an immortal child . While like a child he resents injustice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of responsi64 THE BOOK OF HALLOWE'EN bility .

" BARRIE : Peter and Wendy . , The world in which Peter lived was so near the Kensington Gardens that he could see them through the bridge as he sat on the shore of the Neverland . Yet for a long time he could not get to them . Peter is a fairy piper who steals away the souls of children . " No man alive has seen me , But women hear me play , Sometimes at door or window , Fiddling the souls away ? The child 's soul and the colleen 's Out of the covering clay . " HOPPER : Fairy Fiddler . On Hallowe'en all traditional spirits are abroad . The Scotch invented the idea of a " Samhanach , " a goblin who comes out just // at " Samhain . " It is he who in Ireland steals children . The fairies pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady , The morn is Hallowday ; Then win me , win me , and ye will , For weel I wot ye may .

" Ballad of Tam Lin . i'and in the Highlands whoever took a threelegged stool to where three crossroads met , and sat upon it at midnight , would hear the names of those who were to die in a year . He might bring with him articles of dress , and as each name was pronounced throw one garment to the fairies . They would be so pleased by this gift that they would repeal the sentence of death . Even people who seemed to be like their neighbors every day could for this night fly // away and join the other beings in their revels . " This is the nicht o ' IHallowe'en When a ' the witchie may be seen ; Some o ' them black , some o ' them green , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A witches ' party was conducted in this way . The wretched women who had sold their souls to the Devil , left a stick in bed which by evil means was made to have their likeness , and , anointed with the fat of murdered babies flew off up the chimney on a broomstick with cats attendant . Burns tells the story of a company of witches pulling ragwort by the roadside , getting each astride her ragwort with the summons " Up horsie ! " and flying away . " The hag is astride This night for a ride , The devils and she together : Through thick and through thin , Now out and now in , Though ne'er so foul be the weather . // " A thorn or a burr She takes for a spur , With a lash of the bramble she rides now . Through brake and through briers , O'er ditches and mires , She follows the spirit that guides now . " HERRICK : The Hag . The meeting-place was arranged by the Devil , who sometimes rode there on a goat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they drank out of horses ' skulls , and danced , some-times back to back , sometimes from west to east , for the dances at the ancient Baal festi-vals were from east to west , and it was evil and ill-omened to move the other way . For this dance the Devil played a bag-pipe made of a hen 's skull and cats ' tails . " There sat Auld Nick , in shape o ' beast ; A tousie tyke , black , grim , and large , To gie them music was his charge : He screw 'd the pipes and gart them skirl , Till roof and rafters a ' did dirl. " 1 BuRNs : Tam o ' Shanter. // The light for the revelry came from a torch flaring between the horns of the Devil 's steed , the goat , and at the close the ashes were divided for the witches to use in incantations . People imagined that cats who had been up all night on Hallowe'en were tired out the next morning . Tam o ' Shanter who was watching such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Ayrshire , could not resist calling out at the antics of a neighbor whom he recognized , and was pursued by the witches . He urged his horse to top-speed , " Now do thy speedy utmost , Meg , And win the key-stane of the brig ; There at them thou thy tail may toss , A running stream they dare na cross ! " BURNS : Tarn o ' Shanter. but poor Meg had no tail thereafter to toss at them , for though she saved her rider , she was only her tail 's length beyond the middle of // the bridge when the foremost witch grasped it and seared it to a stub . Such witches might be questioned about the past or future . " He that dare sit on St. S within 's Chair , When the Night-Hag wings the troubled air , Questions three , when he speaks the spell , He may ask , and she must tell . " SCOTT : St. Swithin 's Chair . Children make of themselves bogies on this evening , carrying the largest turnips they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likeness of a fearsome face , with teeth and forehead blacked , and lighted by a candle fastened inside . If the spirit of a person simply appears without being summoned , and the person is still alive , it means that he is in danger . If he comes toward the one to whom he appears the danger is over . If he seems to go away , he is dying . An apparition from the future especially is sought on Hallowe'en . It is a famous time // for divination in love affairs . A typical eighteenth century party in western Scotland is described by Robert Burns . / Cabbages are important in Scotch superstition . Children believe that if they pile cabbage-stalks round the doors and windows of the house , the fairies will bring them a new brother or sister . " And often when in his old-fashioned way He questioned me , . . Who made the stars ? and if within his hand He caught and held one , would his fingers burn ? If I , the gray-haired dominie , was dug From out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BUCHANAN : Willie Baird . Kale-pulling came first on the program in Burns 's Hallowe'en . Just the single and unengaged went out hand in hand blindfolded to the cabbage-garden . They pulled the first stalk they came upon , brought it back to the house , and were unbandaged . The size and shape of the stalk indicated the appearance of the future husband or wife . // " Maybe you would rather not pull a stalk that was tall and straight and strong ? that would mean Alastair ? Maybe you would rather find you had got hold of a withered old stump with a lot of earth at the root ? a decrepit old man with plenty of money in the bank ? Or maybe you are wishing for one that is slim and supple and not so tall ? for one that might mean Johnnie Semple . " BLACK : Hallowe'en Wraith . A close white head meant an old husband , an open green head a young one . His disposition would be like the taste of the stem . To determine his name , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one 's stalk in the row noted . If Jessie put hers up third from the beginning , and the third man who passed through the doorway under it was named Alan , her husband 's first name would be Alan . This is practised only a little now among farmers . It has special virtue if the cabbage has been stolen from the garden of an unmarried person . Sometimes the pith of a cabbage-stalk was pushed out , the hole filled with tow , which // was set afire and blown through keyholes on Hallowe'en . " Their runts clean through and through were bored , And stuffed with raivelins fou , And like a chimley when on fire Each could the reek outspue . " Jock through the key-hole sent a cloud That reached across the house , While in below the door reek rushed Like water through a sluice . " DICK : Splores of a Hallowe'en . Cabbage-broth was a regular dish at the Hallowe'en feast . Mashed potatoes , as in Ireland , or a dish of meal and milk holds symbolic objects ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the cake are baked a ring and a key . The ring signifies to the possessor marriage , and the key a journey . / Apple-ducking is still a universal custom in Scotland . A sixpence is sometimes dropped into the tub or stuck into an apple to make the reward greater . The contestants must keep their hands behind their backs . // Y Nuts are put before the fire in pairs , instead of by threes as in Ireland , and named for a lover and his lass . If they burn to ashes together , a long happy married life is destined for the lovers . If they crackle or start away from each other , dissension and separation are ahead . " Jean slips in twa , wi ' tentie ' e'e ; Wha ' t was , she wadna tell ; But this is Jock , an ' this is me , She says in to hersel ; He bleez 'd owre her , an ' she owre him , As they wad never mair part ; Till fuff ! he started up the lam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see't that night .

' Chimney . // into the clean water , he would marry a maiden ; if into the dirty , a widow ; if into the empty dish , not at all . He tried until he got the same result twice . The dishes were changed about each time . This spell still remains , as does that of hemp-seed sowing . One goes out alone with a handful of hemp-seed , sows it across ridges of ploughed land , and harrows it with anything convenient , perhaps with a broom .

A Highland divination was tried with a shoe , held by the tip , and thrown over the house . The person will journey in the direction the toe points out . If it falls sole up , it means bad luck .

The number of divisions was the number sought . White of egg is held . with water in the mouth , like the grains of oats in Ireland , while one takes a walk to hear mentioned the name of his future wife . Names are written on papers , and laid upon the chimney-piece . Fate guides the hand of a blindfolded man to the slip which bears his sweetheart 's name . A Hallowe'en mirror is made by the rays of the moon shining into a looking-glass .

The wetting of the sark-sleeve in a southrunning burn where " three lairds ' lands meet , " and carrying it home to dry before the fire , was really a Scotch custom , but has already been described in Ireland . // " The last Hallowe'en I was waukin ' My droukit 2 sark-sleeve , as ye kin ?

Just before breaking up , the crowd of young people partook of sowens , oatmeal porridge cakes with butter , and strunt , a liquor , as they hoped for good luck throughout the year .

His ceremonies were similar to those paid to Saman in Ireland , but more picturesque . Ale was brewed at church from malt brought collectively by the people . One took a cupful in his hand , and waded out into the sea up to his waist , saying as he poured it out : " Shony , I give you this cup of ale , hoping that you 'll be so kind as to send us plenty of sea-ware , for enriching our ground the ensuing year . " The party returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candle burning on the altar was blown out . Then they went out into the fields , and drank ale with dance and song . The " dumb cake " originated in Lewis . Girls were each apportioned a small piece of dough , mixed with any but spring water . They kneaded it with their left thumbs , in silence . Before midnight they pricked initials on them with a new pin , and put them by the fire to bake . The girls withIN SCOTLAND 8 z drew to the farther end of the room , still in silence . At midnight each lover was expected to enter and lay his hand on the cake marked with his initials . In South Uist and Eriskay on Hallowe'en fairies are out , a source of terror to those they meet .

CHAPTER IX IN ENGLAND AND MAN MAN especially has a treasury of fairy tradition , Celtic and Norse combined . Manx fairies too dwell in the middle world , since they are fit for neither heaven nor hell . Even now Manx people think they see circles of light in the late October midnight , and little folk dancing within . Longest of all in Man was Sauin ( Samhain ) considered New Year 's Day . According to the old style of reckoning time it came on November 12 . " To-night is New Year 's night . Hogunnaa ! " Mummers ' Song . As in Scotland the servants ' year ends with October . New Year tests for finding out the future were tried on Sauin . To hear her sweet-82 // heart 's name a girl took a mouthful of water and two handfuls of salt , and sat down at a door . The first name she heard mentioned was the wished-for one . The three dishes proclaimed the fate of the blindfolded seeker as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several significant objects ? meal for prosperity , earth for death , a net for tangled fortunes . Before retiring each filled a thimble with salt , and emptied it out in a little mound on a plate , remembering his own . If any heap were found fallen over by morning , the person it represented was destined to die in a year . The Manx looked for prints in the smooth-strewn ashes on the hearth , as the Scotch did , and gave the same interpretation . There had been Christian churches in Britain as early as 300 A. D. , and Christian missionaries , St. Ninian , Pelagius , and St. Patrick , were active in the next century , and in the course of time St. Augustine . Still the old superstitions persisted , as they always do when they have grown up with the people . // King Arthur , who was believed to have reigned in the fifth century , may be a personification of the sun-god .

In Cornwall sloes and blackberries were considered unfit to eat after the fairies had passed by , because all the goodness was extracted . So they were eaten to heart 's content on October 31st , and avoided thereafter . Hazels , because they were thought to contain wisdom and knowledge , were also sacred . Besides leaving berries for the " , Little People , " food was set out for them on Hallowe'en , and on other occasions .

Such sprites did not scruple to pull away the chair as one was about to sit down , to pinch , or even to steal children and leave changelings in their places . The first hint of dawn drove them back to their haunts . " When larks ' gin sing , Away we fling ; And babes new borne steal as we go , And elfe in bed We leave instead , And wend us laughing , ho , ho , ho !

" SHAKSPERE : The Tempest . w The people of England , in common with those who lived in the other countries of Great Britain and in Europe , dreaded the coming of winter not only on account of the cold and loneliness , but because they believed that at this time the powers of evil were abroad and ascendant . This belief harked back to the old idea that the sun had been vanquished by his enemies in the late autumn . It was to forget the fearful influences about them that // the English kept festival so much in the winter-time . The Lords of Misrule , leaders of the revelry , " beginning their rule on All Hallow Eve , continued the same till the mor-row after the Feast of the Purification , coin-monlie called Candelmas day : In all of which space there were fine and subtle dis-guisinges , Maskes , and Mummeries .

They connect themselves thereby with those evil creatures who pursued Tam o ' Shanter , and were servants of the Devil . In 1892 in Lincolnshire , people believed that if they looked in through the church door on Hallowe'en they would see the Devil preaching qo THE BOOK OF HALLOWE'EN his doctrines from the pulpit , and inscribing the names of new witches in his book . The Spectre Huntsman , known in Windsor Forest as Herne the Hunter , and in Todmorden as Gabriel Ratchets , was the spirit of an ungodly hunter who for his crimes was condemned to lead the chase till the Judgment Day . In a storm on Hallowe'en is heard the belling of his hounds . " Still , still shall last the dreadful chase Till time itself shall have an end ; By day they scour earth 's cavern 'd space , At midnight 's witching hour , ascend .

The unfaithful lover 's nut cracks and jumps away , the loyal burns with a steady ardent flame to ashes . " Two hazel-nuts I threw into the flame , And to each nut I gave a sweetheart 's name .

The latch moved up , when who should first come in , But in his proper person ? Lubberkin . " GAY : Pastorals . Candles , relics of the sacred fire , play an important part every where on Hallowe'en . In England too the lighted candle and the apple were fastened to the stick , and as it whirled , each person in turn sprang up and tried to bite the apple .

These games grew later into practical jokes . The use of a goblet may perhaps come from the story of " The Luck of Edenhall , " a glass stolen from the fairies , and holding ruin for the House by whom it was stolen , if it should ever be broken . With ring and goblet this charm was tried : the ring , symbol of marriage , was suspended by a hair within a glass , and a narne spelled out by beginning the alphabet over each time the ring struck the glass .

Though Hallowe'en is decidedly a country festival , in the seventeenth century young gentlemen in London chose a Master of the Revels , and held masques and dances with their friends on this night . In central and southern England the ecclesiastical side of Hallowtide is stressed . Bread or cake has till recently ( 1898 ) been as much a part of Hallowe'en preparations as plum pudding at Christmas . Probably this originated from an autumn baking of bread from the new grain . In Yorkshire each person gets a triangular seed-cake , and the evening is called " cake night . " // " Wife , some time this weeke , if the wether hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeare . Remember you , therefore , though I do it not , The seed-cake , the Pasties , and Furmentie-pot . " TussER : Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandry , 1580 . Cakes appear also at the vigil of All Souls ' , the ' next day . At a gathering they lie in a heap for the guests to take . In return they are supposed to say prayers for the dead . " A Soule-cake , a Soule-cake ; have mercy on all Christen souls for a Soule-cake . " Old Saying . The poor in Staffordshire and Shropshire went about singing for soul-cakes or money , promising to pray and to spend the alms in masses for the dead . The cakes were called Soul-mass or " somas " cakes . " Soul ! Soul 1 for a soul-cake ; Pray , good mistress , for a soul-cake . One for Peter , two for Paul , Three for them who made us all . " Notes and Queries . // In Dorsetshire Hallowe'en was celebrated by the ringing of bells in memory of the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against this practice . In Lancashire in the early nineteenth century people used to go about begging for candles to drive away the gatherings of witches . If the lights were kept burning till midnight , no evil influence could remain near . In Derbyshire , central England , torches of straw were carried about the stacks on All Souls ' Eve , not to drive away evil spirits , as in Scotland , but to light souls through Purgatory . Like the Bretons , the English have the superstition that the dead return on Hallowe'en . " Why do you wait at your door , woman , Alone in the night ? ' I am waiting for one who will come , stranger , To show him a light . He will see me afar on the road , And be glad at the sight .

CHAPTER X IN WALES IN Wales the custom of fires persisted from the time of the Druid festival-days longer than in any other place . First sacrifices were burned in them ; then instead of being burned to death , the creatures merely passed through the fire ; and with the rise of Christianity fire was thought to be a protection against the evil power of the same gods . Pontypridd , in South Wales , was the Druid religious center of Wales . It is still marked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In after years it was believed that the stones were people changed to that form by the power of a witch .

Circling about the fire hand-in-hand they said their prayers and went to bed . In the morning each searched for his stone , and if he could not find it , he believed that he would die within the next twelve months . This is still credited . There is now the custom also of watching the fires till the last spark dies , and instantly rushing down hill , " the devil ( or the cutty black sow ) take the hindmost . " A Cardiganshire proverb says : " A cutty ' black sow On every stile , Spinning and carding Every Allhallows ' Eve . " November Eve was called " Nos-GalanGaeof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , the night before the first day of winter . To the Welsh it was New Year 's Eve . Welsh fairy tradition resembles that in the near-by countries . There is an old story of a Short-tailed. // man who lay down to sleep inside a fairy ring , a circle of greener grass where the fairies danced by night . The fairies carried him away and kept him seven years , and after he had been rescued from them he would neither eat nor speak . In the sea was the Otherworid , a " Green fairy island reposing In sunlight and beauty on ocean 's calm breast . " PARRY : Welsh Melodies . This was the abode of the Druids , and hence of all supernatural beings , who were " Something betwixt heaven and hell , Something that neither stood nor fell . " SCOTT : The Monastery . As in other countries the fairies or pixies are to be met at crossroads , where happenings , such as funerals , may be witnessed weeks before they really occur . ' At the Hallow Eve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apples roasted . A " puzzling jug " holds the ale . In the rim I04 THE BOOK OF HALLOWE'EN are three holes that seem merely ornamental . They are connected with the bottom of the jug by pipes through the handle , and the unwitting toper is well drenched unless he is clever enough to see that he must stop up two of the holes , and drink through the third . Spells are tried in Wales too with apples and nuts . There is ducking and snapping for apples . Nuts are thrown into the fire , denoting prosperity if they blaze brightly , misfortune if they pop , or smoulder and turn black . " Old Pally threw on a nut . It flickered and then blazed up . Maggee tossed one into the fire . It smouldered and gave no light . " MARKS : All-Hallows Honeymoon .

She returns later to find that her future husband has picked up the knife and thrown it into the center of the leek-bed . Taking two long-stemmed roses , a girl goes to her room in silence . She twines the stems together , naming one for her sweetheart and the other for herself , and thinking this rhyme : " Twine , twine , and intertwine . Let his love be wholly mine . If his heart be kind and true , Deeper grow his rose 's hue . " She can see , by watching closely , her lover 's rose grow darker . The sacred ash figures in one charm .

Instead of leaving stones in the fire to determine who are to die , people now go to church to see by the light of a candle held in the hand the spirits of those marked for death , or to hear the names called . The wind " blowing over the feet of the corpses " howls about the doors of those who will not be alive next Hallowe'en . - On the Eve of All Souls ' Day , twenty-four hours after Hallowe'en , children in eastern Wales go from house to house singing for " An apple or a pear , a plum or a cherry , Or any good thing to make us merry . " It is a time when charity is given freely to the poor . On this night and the next day , fires are burned , as in England , to light souls through Purgatory , and prayers are made for a good wheat harvest next year by the Welsh , who keep the forms of religion very devoutly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught by their priests that the soul is immortal . When the body died the spirit passed instantly into another existence in a country close at hand . We remember that the Otherworid of the British Isles , peopled by the banished Tuatha and all superhuman beings , was either in caves in the earth , as in Ireland , or in an island like the English Avalon . By giving a mortal one of their magic apples to eat , fairies could entice him whither they would , and at last away into their country . In the Irish story of Nera ( q. v. ) , the corpse of the criminal is the cause of Nera 's being lured into the cave . So the dead have the same power as fairies , and live in the same place . On May Eve and November Eve the dead and the fairies hold their revels together and make excursions together . If a young 107 to8 THE BOOK OF HALLOWE'EN person died , he was said to be called away by the fairies . The Tuatha may not have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who grew to godlike proportions as the years raised a mound of lore and legends for their pedestal . So they might really be only the dead , and not of superhuman nature . In the fourth century A. D. , the men of England were hard pressed by the Picts and Scots from the northern border , and were helped in their need by the Teutons . When this tribe saw the fair country of the Britons they decided to hold it for themselves . After they had driven out the northern tribes , in the fifth century , when King Arthur was reigning in Cornwall , they drove out those whose cause they had fought . So the Britons were scattered to the mountains of Wales , to Cornwall , and across the Channel to Armorica , a part of France , which they named Brittany after their home-land . In lower Brittany , out of the zone of French influence , a language something like Welsh or old British is still spoken , and many of the Celtic // beliefs were retained more untouched than in Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here especially did Christianity have to adapt the old belief to her own ends . Gaul , as we have seen from Caesar 's account , had been one of the chief seats of Druidical belief . The religious center was Caruutes , now Chartrain . The rites of sacrifice survived in the same forms as in the British Isles . In the fields of Deux-Sevres fires were built of stubble , ferns , leaves , and thorns , and the people danced about them and burned nuts in them . On St. John 's Day animals were burned in the fires to secure the cattle from disease . This was continued down into the seventeenth century . The pagan belief that lasted the longest in Brittany , and is by no means dead yet , was the cult of the dead . Cesar said that the Celts of Gaul traced their ancestry from the god of death , whom he called Dispater . Now figures of l'Ankou , a skeleton armed with a spear , can be seen in most villages of Brittany . z io THE BOOK OF HALLOWE'EN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prehistoric cairns of stones on hilltops , the ancient altars of the Druids , and dolmens , formed of one flat rock resting like a roof on two others set up on end with a space between them , ancient tombs ; and by the Bretons being cut off from the rest of France by the nature of the country , and shut in among the uplands , black and misty in November , and blown over by chill Atlantic winds . Under a seeming dull indifference and melancholy the Bretons conceal a lively imagination , and no place has a greater wealth of legendary literature . What fairies , dwarfs , pixies , and the like are to the Celts of other places , the spirits of the dead are to the Celts of Brittany .

An historian , Procopius , tells how the people nearest Britain were exempted from paying tribute to the Franks , because they were subject to nightly summons to ferry the souls of the dead across in their boats , and deliver them into the hands of the keeper of souls . Farther inland a black bog seemed to be the entrance to an otherworld underground . One location which combined the ideas of an island and a cave was a city buried in the sea .

" BoTREL : Songs of Brittany . V The harvest-time reminded the Bretons of the garnering by that reaper , Death . On November Eve milk is poured on graves , feasts and candles set out on the tables , and fires lighted on the hearths to welcome the spirits of departed kinsfolk and friends . / In France from the twelfth to the fourteenth century stone buildings like lighthouses were erected in cemeteries . They were twenty or thirty feet high , with lanterns on top . On Hallowe'en they were kept burning to safeguard the people from the fear of night-wandering spirits and the dead , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cemetery is the social center of the Breton village . It is at once meeting-place , playground , park , and church . The tombs that outline the hills make the place seem one vast cemetery . On All Souls ' Eve in the mid-nineteenth century the " procession of tombs " was held . All formed a line and walked about the cemetery , calling the names of those who were dead , as they approached their resting-places . The record was carefully remembered , so that not one should seem to be forgotten . " We live with our dead , " say the Bretons . First on the Eve of All Souls ' comes the religious service , " black vespers . " The blessedness of death is praised , the sorrows and shortness of life dwelt upon . After a common prayer all go out to the cemetery to pray separately , each by the graves of his kin , or to the " place of bones , " where the remains of those long dead are thrown all together in one tomb . They can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and rows of skulls at the sides of the entrance can be touched . // In these tombs are Latin inscriptions meaning : " Remember thou must die , " " To-day to me , and to-morrow to thee , " and others reminding the reader of his coming death . From the cemetery the people go to a house or an inn which is the gathering-place for the night , singing or talking loudly on the road to warn the dead who are hastening home , lest they may meet . Reunions of families take place on this night , in the spirit of the Roman feast of the dead , the Feralia , of which Ovid wrote : " After the visit to the tombs and to the ancestors who are no longer with us , it is pleasant to turn towards the living ; after the loss of so many , it is pleasant to behold those who remain of our blood , and to reckon up the generations of our descendants . " Fasti . A toast is drunk to the memory of the departed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the women apart , knitting or spinning by the light of the fire and one candle . The children play with // their gifts of apples and nuts . As the hour grows later , and mysterious noises begin to be heard about the house , and a curtain sways in a draught , the thoughts of the company already centred upon the dead find expression in words , and each has a tale to tell of an adventure with some friend or enemy who has died . The dead are thought to take up existence where they left it off , working at the same trades , remembering their old debts , likes and dislikes , even wearing the same clothes they wore in life . Most of them stay not in some distant , definite Otherworld , but frequent the scenes of their former life . They never trespass upon daylight , and it is dangerous to meet them at night , because they are very ready to punish any slight to their memory , such as selling their possessions or forgetting the hospitality due them . L'Ankou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffins are not lined with them to make a softer resting-place for the dead bodies . The lively Celtic imagination turns the // merest coincidence into an encounter with a spirit , and the poetic temperament of the narrators clothes the stories with vividness and mystery . They tell how the presence of a ghost made the midsummer air so cold that even wood did not burn , and of groans and footsteps underground as long as the ghost is displeased with what his relatives are doing . I ' Just before midnight a bell-man goes about the streets to give warning of the hour when the spirits will arrive . " They will sit where we sat , and will talk of us as we talked of them : in the gray of the morning only will they go away . " LE BRAz : Night of the Dead . The supper for the souls is then set out . The poor who live in the mountains have only black corn , milk , and smoked bacon to offer , but it is given freely . Those who can afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hot pancakes , and mugs of cider . After all have retired to lie with both eyes // shut tight lest they see one of the guests , death-singers make their rounds , chanting under the windows : " You are comfortably lying in your bed , But with the poor dead it is otherwise ; You are stretched softly in your bed While the poor souls are wandering abroad . " A white sheet and five planks , A bundle of straw beneath the head , Five feet of earth above Are all the worldly goods we own . " LE BRAZ : Night of the Dead . The tears of their deserted friends disturb the comfort of the dead , and sometimes they appear to tell those in sorrow that their shrouds are always wet from the tears shed on their graves . Wakened by the dirge of the death-singers the people rise and pray for the souls of the departed . Divination has little part in the annals of the evening , but one in Finistere is recorded . Twenty-five new needles are laid in a dish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Those who cross are enemies . In France is held a typical Continental celebration of All Saints ' and All Souls ' . On October 31st the children go asking for flowers to decorate the graves , and to adorn the church . At night bells ring to usher in All Saints ' . On the day itself the churches are decorated gaily with flowers , candles , and banners , and a special service is held . On the second day of November the light and color give way to black drapings , funeral songs , and prayers . CHAPTER XII THE TEUTONIC RELIGION . WITCHES THE Teutons , that race of northern peoples called by the Romans , " barbarians , " comprised the Goths and Vandals who lived in Scandinavia , and the Germans who dwelt north of Italy and east of Gaul . The nature of the northern country was such that the people could not get a living by peaceful agriculture . So it was natural that in the intervals of cattle-tending they should explore the seas all about , and ravage neighboring lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries just before and after Christ , and England from the eighth to the tenth centuries . Such a life made the Norsemen adventurous , hardy , warlike , independent , and quick of action , while the Celts were by nature more slothful and fond of peaceful social gatherings , though of quicker intellect and wit . // Like the Greeks and Romans , the Teutons had twelve gods and goddesses , among whom were Odin or Wotan , the king , and his wife Freya , queen of beauty and love . Idun guarded the apples of immortality , which the gods ate to keep them eternally young . The chief difference in Teutonic mythology was the presence of an evil god , Loki . Like Vulcan , Loki was a god of fire , like him , Loki was lame because he had been cast out of heaven . Loki was always plotting against the other gods , as Lucifer , after being banished from Heaven by God , plotted against him and his people , and became Satan , " the enemy . " " Him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky With hideous ruin and combustion down To bottomless perdition , there to dwell In adamantine chains and penal fire , Who durst defy th ' Omnipotent to arms . " MILTON : Paradise Lost . It was this god of evil in Teutonic myth who was responsible for the death of the bright beautiful sun-god , Baldur . Mistletoe // was the only thing in the world which had not sworn not to harm Baldur . Loki knew this , and gave a twig of mistletoe to Baldur 's blind brother , Hodur , and Hodur cast it at Baldur and " unwitting slew " him . Vali , a younger brother of Baldur , avenged him by killing Hodur . Hodur is darkness and Baldur light ; they are brothers ; the light falls a victim to blind darkness , who reigns until a younger brother , the sun of the next day , rises to slay him in turn . Below these gods , all nature was peopled with divinities . There were elves of two kinds : black elves , called trolls , who were frost-spirits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white elves , who lived in mid-heaven , and danced on the earth in fairy rings , where a mortal entering died . Will-o ' - the-wisps hovered over swamps to mislead travellers , and jack-o ' - lanterns , the spirits of murderers , walked the earth near the places of their crimes . The Otherworlds of the Teutons were Valhalla , the abode of the heroes whom death // had found on the battlefield , and Niflheim , " the misty realm , " secure from the cold outside , ruled over by Queen Hel . Valkyries , warlike women who rode through the air on swift horses , seized the heroes from the field of slaughter , and took them to the halls of Valhalla , where they enjoyed daily combats , long feasts , and drinking-bouts , music and story-telling . The sacred tree of the Druids was the oak ; that of the Teutonic priests the ash . The flat disk of the earth was believed to be supported by a great ash-tree , Yggdrasil , " An ash know I standing , Named Yggdrasil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come the dewdrops That fall in the dales ; Ever-blooming , it stands O'er the Urdar-fountain . " Voluspa saga . ( Blackwell trans. ) guarded by three fates , Was , Will , and Shall Be . The name of Was means the past , of // Will , the power , howbeit small , which men have over present circumstances , and Shall Be , the future over which man has no control . Vurdh , the name of the latter , gives us the word " weird , " which means fate or fateful . The three Weird Sisters in Macbeth are seeresses . Besides the ash , other trees and shrubs were believed to have peculiar powers , which they have kept , with some changes of meaning , to this day . The elder ( elves ' grave ) , the hawthorn , and the juniper , were sacred to supernatural powers . The priests of the Teutons sacrificed prisoners of war in consecrated groves , to Tyr , god of the sword . The victims were not burned alive , as by the Druids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned . From these sacrifices auspices were taken . A man 's innocence or guilt was manifested by gods to men through ordeals by fire ; walking upon red-hot ploughshares , holding a heated bar of iron , or thrusting the hands into redhot gauntlets , or into boiling water . If after I24 THE BOOK OF HALLOWE'EN a certain number of days no burns appeared the person was declared innocent . If a suspected man , thrown into the water , floated , he was guilty ; if he sank , he was acquitted . The rites of the Celts were done in secret , and it was forbidden that they be written down . Those of the Teutons were commemorated in Edda and Saga ( poetry and prose ) . In the far north the shortness of summer and the length of winter so impressed the people that when they made a story about it they told of a maiden , the Spring , put to sleep , and guarded , along with a hoard of treasure , by a ring of fire . One knight only could break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is the returning sun , and the treasure he gets possession of is the wealth of summer vegetation . So there is the story of Brynhild , pricked by the " sleep-thorn " of her father , Wotan , and sleeping until Sigurd wakens her . They marry , but soon Sigurd has to give her up to Gunnar , the relentless winter , and Gunnar can not rest until he has killed Sigurd , and // reigns undisturbed . Grimms ' story of Rapunzel , the princess who was shut up by a winter witch , and of Briar-Rose , pricked by a witch 's spindle , and sleeping inside a hedge which blooms with spring at the knight 's approach , mean likewise the struggle between summer and winter . The chief festivals of the Teutonic year were held at Midsummer and Midwinter . MayDay , the very beginning of spring , was celebrated by May-ridings , when winter and spring , personified by two warriors , engaged in a combat in which Winter , the fur-clad king of ice and snow , was defeated . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sacrificial feast held . Judgments were rendered then . The summer solstice was marked by bonfires , like those of the Celts on May Eve and Midsummer . They were kindled in an open place or on a hill , and the ceremonies held about them were similar to the Celtic . As late as the eighteenth century these same customs were observed in Iceland . 1 26 THE BOOK OF HALLOWE'EN A May-pole wreathed with magical herbs is erected as the center of the dance in Sweden , and in Norway a child chosen May-bride is followed by a procession as at a real wedding . This is a symbol of the wedding of sun and earth deities in the spring . The Maypole , probably imported from Celtic countries , is used at Midsummer because the spring does not begin in the north before June . Yule-tide in December celebrated the sun 's turning back , and was marked by banquets and gayety . A chief feature of all these feasts was the drinking of toasts to the gods , with vows and prayers . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the ninth before Christianity made much progress in Scandinavia . After King Olaf had converted his nation , the toasts which had been drunk to the pagan gods were kept in honor of Christian saints ; for instance , those to Freya were now drunk to the Virgin Mary or to St. Gertrude . The " wetting of the sark-sleeve , " that // custom of Scotland and Ireland , was in its earliest form a rite to Freya as the northern goddess of love . To secure her aid in a loveaffair , a maid would wash in a running stream a piece of fine linen ? for Freya was fond of personal adornment ? and would hang it before the fire to dry an hour before midnight . At half-past eleven she must turn it , and at twelve her lover 's apparition would appear to her , coming in at the half-open door . " The wind howled through the leafless boughs , and there was every appearance of an early and severe winter , as indeed befell . Long before eleven o'clock all was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( nothing was heard ) , except the cold wind which howled mournfully in gusts . The house was an old farmhouse , and we sat in the large kitchen with its stone floor , awaiting the first stroke of the eleventh hour . It struck at last , and then all pale and trembling we hung the garment before the fire which we had piled up with wood , and set the door ajar , for that was an essential point . The door was lofty and opened upon the farmyard , through which there was a kind of thoroughfare , very seldom used , it is true , and 1 28 THE BOOK OF HALLOWE'EN at each end of it there was a gate by which wayfarers occasionally passed to shorten the way . There we sat without speaking a word , shivering with cold and fear , listening to the clock which went slowly , tick , tick , and occasionally starting as the door creaked on its hinges , or a half-burnt billet fell upon the hearth . My sister was ghastly white , as white as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now half an hour had elapsed and it was time to turn . . . . This we did , I and my sister , without saying a word , and then we again sank on our chairs on either side of the fire . I was tired , and as the clock went tick-a-tick , I began to feel myself dozing . I did doze , I believe . All of a sudden I sprang up . The clock was striking one , two , but ere it could give the third chime , mercy upon us ! we heard the gate slam to with a tremendous noise . . . . " Well , and what happened then ? " " Happened ! before I could recover myself , my sister had sprung to the door , and both locked and bolted it . The next moment she was in convulsions . I scarcely knew what happened ; and yet it appeared to me for a moment that something pressed against the door with a low moaning sound . Whether it was the wind // or not , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . About two hours later , my father came home . He had been set upon by a highwayman whom he beat off . " BORROW : Lavengro . I Freya and Odin especially had had power over the souls of the dead . When Christianity turned all the old gods into spirits of evil , these two were accused especially of possessing unlawful learning , as having knowledge of the hidden matters of death . This unlawful wisdom is the first accusation that has always been brought against witches . A mirror is often used to contain it . Such are the crystals of the astrologers , and the looking-glasses which on Hallowe'en materialize wishes . From that time in the Middle Ages when witches were first heard of , it has nearly always been women who were accused . Women for the most part were the priests in the old days : it was a woman to whom Apollo at Delphi breathed his oracles . In all times it has been women who plucked herbs // and concocted drinks of healing and refreshment . So it was very easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic power under the guidance of the now evil gods . If they were so directed , they must go on occasions to consult with their masters . The idea arose of a witches ' Sabbath , when women were enabled by evil means , to fly away , and adore in secret the gods from whom the rest of the world had turned . There were such meeting-places all over Europe . They had been places of sacrifice , of judgment , or of wells and springs considered holy under the old religion , and whither the gods had now been banished . The most famous was the Blocksberg in the Hartz mountains in Germany . " Dame Baubo first , to lead the crew ! A tough old sow and the mother thereon , Then follow the witches , every one . " GoETHE : Faust . ( Taylor trans . ) In Norway the mountains above Bergen were a resort , and the Dovrefeld , once the home of the trolls . // " It 's easy to slip in here , But outward the Dovre-King 's gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archer trans . ) In Italy the witches met under a walnut tree near Benevento ; in France , in Puy de Dome ; in Spain , near Seville . In these night-ridings Odin was the leader of a wild hunt . In stormy , blustering autumn weather " The wonted roar was up among the woods . " MILTON : ComuS . Odin rode in pursuit of shadowy deer with the Furious Host behind him . A ghostly huntsman of a later age was Dietrich von Bern , doomed to hunt till the Judgment Day . Frau Venus in Wagner 's Tannlcauser held her revels in an underground palace in the Horselberg in Thuringia , Germany . This was one of the seats of Holda , the goddess of spring . Venus herself is like the Christian conception of Freya and Hel . She gathers about her a throng of nymphs , sylphs , and // those she has lured into the mountain by intoxicating music and promises . " The enchanting sounds enticed only those in whose hearts wild sensuous longings had already taken root . " Of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it seems to him only one day . Already he is tired of the rosy light and eternal music and languor , and longs for the fresh green world of action he once knew . He fears that he has forfeited his soul 's salvation by being there at all , but cries , " Salvation rests for me in Mary 1 " WAGNER : Tannhauser . At the holy name Venus and her revellers vanish , and Tannhauser finds himself in a meadow , hears the tinkling herd-bells , and a shepherd 's voice singing , " Frau Holda , goddess of the spring , Steps forth from the mountains old ; She comes , and all the brooklets sing , And fled is winter 's cold . * * * // Play , play , my pipe , your lightest lay , For spring has come , and merry May ! " Tannhiiuser . ( Huckel trans. ) praising the goddess in her blameless state . vBy the fifteenth century Satan , taking the place of the gods , assumed control of the evil creatures . Now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their names in his book , and were carried away by him for the revels by night . A new witch was pricked with a needle to initiate her into his company . At the party the Devil was adored with worship due to God alone . Dancing , a device of the pagans , and hence considered wholly wicked , was indulged in to unseemly lengths . In 1883 in Sweden it was believed that dances were held about the sanctuaries of the ancient gods , and that whoever stopped to watch were caught by the dancers and whirled away . If they profaned holy days by this dancing , they were doomed to keep it up for a year . At the witches ' Sabbath the Devil himself // sometimes appeared as a goat , and the witches were attended by cats , owls , bats , and cuckoos , because these creatures had once been sacred to Freya . At the feast horse-flesh , once the food of the gods at banquets , was eaten . The broth for the feast was brewed in a kettle held over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seat of Apollo 's priestess at Delphi . The kettle may be a reminder of the one Thor got , which gave to each guest whatever food he asked of it , or it may be merely that used in brewing the herb-remedies which women made before they were thought to practise witchcraft . In the kettle were cooked mixtures which caused storms and shipwrecks , plagues , and blights . No salt was eaten , for that was a wholesome substance . The witches of Germany did not have prophetic power ; those of Scandinavia , like the Norse Fates , did have it . The troll-wives of Scandinavia were like the witches of Germany ? they were cannibals , especially relishing children , like the witch in Hansel and Grethel . From the fourteenth to the eighteenth conTHE // tury all through Europe and the new world people thought to be witches , and hence in the devil 's service , were persecuted . It was believed that they were able to take the form of beasts . A wolf or other animal is caught in a trap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lives alone in the woods is found suffering from a similar wound . She is then declared to be a witch . " There was once an old castle in the middle of a vast thick wood ; in it lived an old woman quite alone , and she was a witch . By day she made herself into a cat or a screech-owl , but regularly at night she became a human being again . " GRImm : Jorinda and Joringel . " Hares found on May morning are witches and should be stoned , " reads an old superstition . " If you tease a cat on May Eve , it will turn into a witch and hurt you . " CHAPTER XIII WALPURGIS NIGHT WALPURGA was a British nun who went to Germany in the eighth century to found holy houses . After a pious life she was buried at Eichstatt , where it is said a healing oil trickled from her rock-tomb . This miracle reminded men of the fruitful dew which fell from the manes of the Valkyries ' horses , and when one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wedding-day of Frau Holda and the sun-god , the people thought of her as a Valkyrie , and identified her with Holda . As , like a Valkyrie , she rode armed on her steed , she scattered , like Holda , spring flowers and fruitful dew upon the fields and vales . When these deities fell into disrepute , Walpurga too joined the pagan train that swept the sky on the eve of May first , and met 136 // afterwards on mountain-tops to sacrifice and to adore Holda , as the priests had sacrificed for a prosperous season and a bountiful harvest . So this night was called Walpurgis Night , when evil beings were abroad , and with them human worshippers who still guarded the old faith in secret . This is very like the occasion of November Eve , which shared with May first Celtic manifestations of evil . Witches complete the list of supernatural beings which are out on Hallowe'en . All are to be met at crossroads , with harm to the beholders . A superstition goes , that if one wishes to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , and creep backward to a crossroads , or wear wild radish , on May Eve . On Walpurgis Night precaution must be taken against witches who may harm cattle . The stable doors are locked and sealed with three crosses . Sprigs of ash , hawthorn , juniper , and elder , once sacred to the pagan gods , are now used as a protection against them . // Horseshoes are nailed prongs up on the threshold or over the door . Holy bells are hung on the cows to scare away the witches , and they are guided to pasture by a goad which has been blessed . Shots are fired over the cornfield . If one wishes , he may hide in the corn and hear what will happen for a year . Signs and omens on Walpurgis Night have more weight than at other times except on St. John 's Day . " On Walpurgis Night rain Makes good crops of autumn grain , " but rain on May Day is harmful to them . Lovers try omens on this eve , as they do in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , you will find on May morning in the toe a hair the color of your sweetheart 's . Girls try to find out the temperament of their husbands-to-be by keeping a linen thread for three days near an image of the Madonna , and at midnight on May Eve pulling it apart , saying : // " Thread , I pull thee ; Walpurga , I pray thee , That thou show to me What my husband 's like to be . " They judge of his disposition by the thread 's being strong or easily broken , soft or tightly woven . Dew on the morning of May first makes girls who wash in it beautiful . " The fair maid who on the first of May Goes to the fields at break of day And washes in dew from the hawthorn tree Will ever after handsome be . " Encyclopedia of Superstitions . A heavy dew on this morning presages a good " butter-year . " You will find fateful initials printed in dew on a handkerchief that has been left out all the night of April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cuckoo ! cuckoo ! on the bough , Tell me truly , tell me how Many years there will be Till a husband comes to me. " // Then they count the calls of the cuckoo until he pauses again . If a man wears clothes made of yarn spun on Walpurgis Night to the May-shooting , he will always hit the bull's-eye , for the Devil gives away to those he favors , " freikugeln , " bullets which always hit the mark . On Walpurgis Night as on Hallowe'en strange things may happen to one . Zschokke tells a story of a Walpurgis Night dream that is more a vision than a dream . Led to be unfaithful to his wife , a man murders the husband of a former sweetheart ; to escape capture he fires a haystack , from which a whole village is kindled . In his flight he enters an empty carriage , and drives away madly , crushing the owner under the wheels . He finds that the dead man is his own brother . Faced by the person whom he believes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wretched man is ready to worship him if he will protect him . He finds that the seeming Devil is in reality his guardian-angel who sent him this dream that he might learn the // depths of wickedness lying unfathomed in his heart , waiting an opportunity to burst out . Both May Eve and St. John 's Eve are times of freedom and unrestraint . People are filled with a sort of madness which makes them unaccountable for their deeds . " For you see , pastor , within every one of us a spark of paganism is glowing . It has outlasted the thousand years since the old Teutonic times . Once a year it flames up high , and we call it St. John 's Fire . Once a year comes Freenight . Yes , truly , Free-night . Then the witches , laughing scornfully , ride to Blocksberg , upon the mountain-top , on their broomsticks , the same broomsticks with which at other times their witchcraft is whipped out of them ; then the whole wild company skims along the forest way , ? and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fulfilled . " SUDERMANN : St. John 's Fire . ( Porter trans . ) ONLY the Celts and the Teutons celebrate an occasion actually like our Hallowe'en . The countries of southern Europe make of it a religious vigil , like that already described in France . In Italy on the night of All Souls ' , the spirits of the dead are thought to be abroad , as in Brittany . They may mingle with living people , and not be remarked . The Miserere is heard in all the cities . As the people pass dressed in black , bells are rung on street corners to remind them to pray for the souls of the dead . In Naples the skeletons in the funeral vaults are dressed up , and the place visited on All Souls ' Day . In Salerno before the people go to the all-night service at 142 // church they set out a banquet for the dead . If any food is left in the morning , evil is in store for the house . " Hark ! Hark to the wind ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all souls come back from the far away ? The dead , forgotten this many a day ! " And the dead remembered ? ay ! long and well ? And the little children whose spirits dwell In God 's green garden of asphodel . " Have you reached the country of all content , O souls we know , since the day you went From this time-worn world , where your years were spent ? " Would you come back to the sun and the rain , The sweetness , the strife , the thing we call pain , And then unravel life 's tangle again ? " I lean to the dark ? Hush ! ? was it a sigh ? Or the painted vine-leaves that rustled by ? Or only a night-bird 's echoing cry ? " SHEARD : Hallowe'en . // In Malta bells are rung , prayers said , and mourning worn on All Souls ' Day . Graves are decorated , and the inscriptions on tombs read and reread . For the poor is prepared an All Souls ' dinner , as cakes are given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of decorating graves with flowers and offering flowers to the dead comes from the crowning of the dead by the ancients with short-lived blooms , to signify the brevity of life . In Spain at dark on Hallowe'en cakes and nuts are laid on graves to bribe the spirits not to disturb the vigils of the saints . I/ In Germany the graves of the dead are decorated with flowers and lights , on the first and second of November . To drive away ghosts from a church a key or a wand must be struck three times against a bier . An All Souls ' divination in Germany is a girl 's going out and asking the first young man she meets his name . Her husband 's will be like it . If she walks thrice about a church and makes a wish , she will see it fulfilled . Belgian children build shrines in front of // their homes with figures of the Madonna and candles , and beg for money to buy cakes . As many cakes as one eats , so many souls he frees from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead returned , and were grieved at the lamentations of their living relatives . The same belief was found in Brittany , and among the American Indians . " Think of this , 0 Hiawatha ! Speak of it to all the people , That henceforward and forever They no more with lamentations Sadden souls of the departed In the Islands of the Blessed . " LONGFELLOW : Hiawatha . " The Chinese fear the dead and the dragons of the air . They devote the first three weeks in April to visiting the graves of their ancestors , and laying baskets of offerings on them . The great dragon , Feng-Shin , flies scattering blessings upon the houses . His path is straight , unless he meets with some building . Then he turns aside , and the // owner of the too lofty edifice misses the blessing . At Nikko , Japan , where there are many shrines to the spirits of the dead , masques are held to entertain the ghosts who return on Midsummer Day . Every street is lined with lighted lanterns , and the spirits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with lanterns , and floated down the river . To see ghosts in Japan one must put one hundred rush-lights into a large lantern , and repeat one hundred lines of poetry , taking one light out at the end of each line ; or go out into the dark with one light and blow it out . Ghosts are identified with witches . They come back especially on moonlit nights . " On moonlight nights , when the coast-wind whispers in the branches of the tree , 0-Matsue and Teoyo may sometimes be seen , with bamboo rakes in their hands , gathering together the needles of the fir . " KINDER : Great Fir-Tree of Takasago . There is a Chinese saying that a mirror is // the soul of a woman , A pretty story is told of a girl whose mother before she died gave her a mirror , saying : " Now after I am dead , if you think longingly of me , take out the thing that you will find inside this box , and look at it . When you do so my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When she was lonely or her stepmother was harsh with her , the girl went to her room and looked earnestly into the mirror . She saw there only her own face , but it was so much like her mother 's that she believed it was hers indeed , and was consoled . When the stepmother learned what it was her daughter cherished so closely , her heart softened toward the lonely girl , and her life was made easier . By the Arabs spirits were called Djinns ( or genii ) . They came from fire , and looked like men or beasts . They might be good or evil , beautiful or horrible , and could disappear from mortal sight at will . Nights when they were abroad , it behooved men to stay under cover . // " Ha ! They are on us , close without ! Shut tight the shelter where we lie ; With hideous din the monster rout , Dragon and vampire , fill the sky . " HUGO : The Djinns .

Ballads were sung and ghoststories told , for the dead were thought to return on Hallowe'en . " There was a young officer in Phips 's company at the time of the finding of the Spanish treasure-ship , who had gone mad at the sight of the bursting sacks that the ( livers had brought up from the sea , as the gold coins covered the deck .

Henry Hudson and his fellow-explorers haunted as mountain-trolls the Catskill range . Like Ossian and so many other visitors to the Otherworld , Rip Van Winkle is lured into the strange gathering , thinks that he passes the night there , wakes , and goes home to find that twenty years have whitened his hair , rusted his gun , and snatched from life many of his boon-companions . " My gun must have cotched the rheumatix too . Now that 's too bad . Them fellows have gone and stolen my good gun , and leave me this rusty old barrel . " Why , is that the village of Falling Waters that I see ? Why , the place is more than twice the size it was last night ? I // " I do n't know whether I am dreaming , or sleeping , or waking . " JEFFERSON : Rip Van Winkle .

" LoNGFELLow : Giles Corey of the Salem Farms . Men and women who had enemies to accuse them of evil knowledge and the power to cause illness in others , were hanged or pressed to death by heavy weights . Such sicknesses they could cause by keeping a waxen image , and sticking pins or nails into it , or melting it before the fire . The person whom they hated would be in torture , or would waste away like the waxen doll . Witches ' power to injure and to prophesy came from the Devil , who marked them with a needle-prick . Such marks were sought as evidence at trials . // " Witches ' eyes are coals of fire from the pit . " They were attended by black cats , owls , bats , and toads . Iron , as being a product of fire , was a protection against them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power when in the shape of a horseshoe . " This horseshoe will I nail upon the threshold . There , ye night-hags and witches that torment The neighborhood , ye shall not enter here . " LONGFELLOW : Giles Corey of the Salem Farms . The holiday-time of elves , witches , and ghosts is Hallowe'en . It is not believed in here except by some children , who people the dark with bogies who will carry them away if they are naughty . " Onc't they was a little boy would n't say his prayers ? An ' when he went to bed at night , away up-stairs , His mammy heerd him holler , an ' his daddy heerd him bawl , An ' when they tur n't the kivvers down , he was n't there at all ! // An ' they seeked him in the rafter-room , an ' cubby-hole , an ' press , An ' seeked him up the chimbley-flue , an ' ever ' - wheres , I guess ; But all they ever found was thist his pants an ' roundabout ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't watch out ! " RILEY : Little Orphant Annie . Negroes are very superstitious , putting faith in all sorts of supernatural beings . " Blame my trap ! how de wind do blow ; And dis is das de night for de witches , sho ! Dey 's trouble going to waste when de ole slut whine , An ' you hear de cat a-spittin ' when de moon do n't shine . " RILEY : When de Folks is Gone . While the original customs of Hallowe'en are being forgotten more and more across the ocean , Americans have fostered them , and are making this an occasion something like what it must have been in its best days overseas . /All Hallowe'en customs in the United States are borrowed directly or adapted from those // of other countries . All superstitions , everyday ones , and those pertaining to Christmas and New Year 's , have special value on Hallowe'en . it is a night of ghostly and merry revelry .

I do hope they 'll not put the gate up on the shed as they did last year . " WRIGHT : Tom 's Hallowe'en Joke . Bags filled with flour sprinkle the passers-by . Door-bells are rung and mysterious raps sounded on doors , things thrown into halls , and knobs stolen . Such sports mean no more at Hallowe'en than the tricks played the night before the Fourth of July have to do with the Declaration of Independence . We see manifested on all such occasions the spirit of " Free-night " of which George von Hartwig speaks so enthusiastically in St. John 's Fire ( page 141 ) . // Hallowe'en parties are the real survival of the ancient merrymakings . They are prepared for in secret . Guests are not to divulge the fact that they are invited . Often they come masked , as ghosts or witches . The decorations make plain the two elements of the festival . For the centerpiece of the table there may be a hollowed pumpkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harvest , or a pumpkin-chariot drawn by fieldmice . So it is clear that this is a harvestparty , like Pomona 's feast . In the coach rides a witch , representing the other element , of magic and prophecy . Jack-o ' - lanterns , with which the room is lighted , are hollowed pumpkins with candles inside . The candlelight shines through holes cut like features . So the lantern becomes a bogy , and is held up at a window to frighten those inside . Cornstalks from the garden stand in clumps about the room . A frieze of witches on broomsticks , with cats , bats , and owls surmounts the fireplace , perhaps . A full moon shines over all , and a caldron on a tripod holds fortunes 1 56 THE BOOK OF HALLOWE'EN tied in nut-shells . The prevailing colors are yellow and black : a deep yellow is the color of most ripe grain and fruit ; black stands for black magic and demoniac influence . Ghosts and skulls and cross-bones , symbols of death , startle the beholder . Since Hallowe'en is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other sentimental tokens are used to good effect , as the Scotch lads of Burns 's time wore love-knots . Having marched to the dining-room to the time of a dirge , the guests find before them plain , hearty fare ; doughnuts , gingerbread , cider , popcorn , apples , and nuts honored by time . The Hallowe'en cake has held the place of honor since the beginning here in America . A ring , key , thimble , penny , and button baked in it foretell respectively speedy marriage , a journey , spinsterhood , wealth , and bachelorhood . " Polly was going to be married , Jennie was going on a long journey , and you ? down went the knife against something hard . The girls crowded round . You had a hurt in your throat , // and there , there , in your slice , was the horrid , hateful , big brass thimble . It was more than you could bear ? soaking , dripping wet , and an old maid ! " BRADLEY : Different Party . The kitchen is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the stems of the apples which are to be dipped for may be tied names ; for the boys in one tub , for the girls in another . Each searcher of the future must draw out with his teeth an apple with a name which will be like that of his future mate . A variation of the Irish snap-apple is a hoop hung by strings from the ceiling , round which at intervals are placed bread , apples , cakes , peppers , candies , and candles . The strings are twisted , then let go , and as the hoop revolves , each may step up and get a bite from whatever comes to him . By the taste he determines what the character of his married life will be , ? whether wholesome , acid , soft , fiery , or sweet . Whoever bites the candle is twice unfortunate , for he must pay 1 58 THE BOOK OF HALLOWE'EN a forfeit too . An apple and a bag of flour are placed on the ends of a stick , and whoever dares to seize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Apples are suspended one to a string in a doorway . As they swing , each guest tries to secure his apple . To blow out a candle as it revolves on a stick requires attention and accuracy of aim . The one who first succeeds in threading a needle as he sits on a round bottle on the floor , will be first married . Twelve candles are lighted , and placed at convenient distances on the floor in a row . As the guest leaps over them , the first he blows out will indicate his wedding-month . One candle only placed on the floor and blown out in the same way means a year of wretchedness ahead . If it still burns , it presages a year of joy . Among the quieter tests some of the most common are tried with apple-seeds . As in England a pair of seeds named for two lovers are stuck on brow or eyelids . The one who sticks longer is the true , the one who soon falls , the disloyal sweetheart . Seeds are used    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
