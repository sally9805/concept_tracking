txt Directors of the Baltimore &; Ohio have issued a circular to stockholders asking their approval at a special meeting November 16 of a plan to authorize a new mortgage covering the enure system and subsidiary lines . Total amount of bonds issuable will be limited 10 $600,000.000 unless the stockholders shall expressly authorize issues in excess of that amount , but in no case is the amount outStanding under the new mortgage , together with the outstanding prior issues , to exceed three times the capital stock of the company . President Willard 's circular to the stockholders states that the general refunding and improvement mortgage will provide in a comprehensive way for present needs and future financial requirements . Mr. Willard calls attention to the various Baltimore &; Ohio mortgages now existing , includng those of the prior lien bonds , $75,000,000 ; the first mortgage for $81,000.000 ; Southwestern division bonds . $45,000,000 ; Pittsburgh . Lake Erie S. West Virginia refunding bonds , $43,441,100 ; the convertible issue of $63,250,000 , and various other issues , all aggregating $334,697,780 . The circular continues : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the recent past , it became necessary for the company to issue short time notes for its requirements ; the issue of such notes at pre , ent out-standing amounts to $35,000.000 , maturing June 1 , 1013 . " With the exception of the first mortgage , which provides for a further issue of $1,000.000 of bonds each year for nine years . the several mortgages of the company afford no provision for future requirements . Consequently there has been under consideration for some time past a plan for making a mortgage covering the entire system and subsidiary lines , under which bonds may be issued to retire existing indebtedness as it matures , and to provide funds needed from time to time for additions to and extension of the company 's railroad and property , necessary for the further development of the important territory occupied by your lines and to care for the constantly expanding traffic . " " The stockholders will be asked to consider a plan to meet the financial requirements of the company as above indicated , and if approved , to authorize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines , under which bonds may be issued in series from time to time for refunding and other corporate purposes . Each series as issued will boar such rate of interest and generally be in such form as to best meet then existing conditions ; but all will be equally secured by the same mortgage . It is proposed to limit the amount of bonds which may be issued under the mortgage to $600,000 , - 000 , unless the stockholders should later give further consent to additional issue , but at no time shall the amount outstanding , together with all prior debts , exceed three times the capital stock of the company . " At the special meeting , in Baltimore , Monday , November 16 , another plan contemplating the acquisition . of direct ownership or merger with respect to properties in the state of Ohio will be submitted for approval . This will be similar to what the Baltimore &; Ohio has already done with its properties in West Virginia and Pennsylvania . There will be no increase of investment , the only effect being to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been included in those of the system . The company 's annual meeting will be held November 16 , and the special meeting on the same day , immediately following it . Commenting on the plan to create a new refunding and improvement mortgage for the B. 0 . , President Willard said : " This is a matter that we have been at work upon continuously ever since my connection with the road began . There were reasons why we could not do it before , chiefly because we had something like 200 corporations in our system . These have now been cut down to about forty . " I have been against raising money by the sale of notes , which we have been forced to resort to , and I want to get away from the necessity of selling 6.50,000,000 or $60,000,000 of securities at one time . This mortgage will enable us , under favorable circumstances . to avoid the use  --  of notes and to sell two , five or ten millions of bonds at a time , according to our needs . " We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which arc either free of mortgage or on which we own practically all the bonds . These will at once become Orst lien security under the new mortgage . Most of our prior mortgages mature or are in 192 : ; or before . that in a comparatively short time , us such things go , we will have a first mortgage on the entire system , representing our whole funded debt and capable of being used for all our improvements and additions for as far ahead as we can calculate . " This does not mean , of course , that v. e shall not use stock for financing as the opportunity presents itself . " ?
