IT was a somnolent afternoon in May . There was a grass-cutter on the college lawn outside , and a persistent oriole in the elms . We were on Browning ; " Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came " was the lesson . As the application to life and idealism became clear , the mystery of the poem began to stir the men before me . In spite of the drowsy noises and the warm sleepiness of the air , I could see interest awaken in their faces , and feel their minds stretch to take in the thought of the poet . When I reached " Dauntless the slug-horn to my lips I set , and blew . Childe Roland to the Dark Tower came , " I could pause in a tense silence , and say , " That 's all for to-day , " with quite a pleasant glow of successful achievement . They picked up their hats and most of them scurried for the ball-game . But a row gathered in front of my desk . " What is my mark , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimistic mood . " Am I going to be warned this month ? " said another . " Are we going to have this in the examination ? " a third pleaded . Then up stood , then out stepped , then in struck , amid all these , a fourth with a cold , hard-sauled look to him . " What is there Practical in all this literature , Professor ? " he queried , obstinately ; and might have added , ! ' Your answer wo n't interest me . " I went into my office , and sat down to think it out . I remembered a phrase of my old teacher : " The astonishing power of the undergraduate mind to resist the intrusion of knowledge . " I remembered the multitudinous articles , essays , letters , reports I had been reading on the failure of the colleges ; the shot and hail which ( in papers they never read , and speeches they never hear ) had been pouring on these boys ; and , thinking not so much of the disappointment of this last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered if it were not all true . Then I began to take stock . And as I thought over my years in college and my years of teaching , and the misunderstandings and the blindnesses of them , and the charming boys I had known , and the wasted energies , and all the mistakes to be made in dealing with plastic but incalculable life , I found myself coming out at a door quite different from the one by which I had entered . I felt as great an impatience with the howl and outcry against the colleges and the undergraduate as with the story-tellers who have been romanticizing college life until they have distorted it . The saying of gentle Traherne came into my mind , " Prize what you have , " and I began to wonder if before we accept the growing condemnation of college life , and the failure of the college to educate , it would not be well to understand and to appreciate the undergraduate . It is not an easy thing to do . On the one hand , there is sentimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the other , there is the business man who says he is untrained , the literary man who calls him illiterate , and the educator who asserts that he is unwilling . There is his own personality , which is in a transition stage , and so doubly hard to comprehend . And there are his poses , many and various , which must be discounted before we can begin . Nevertheless , it is a dull observer who can not be certain that three estimable virtues ? conrtesy , energy , and loyalty ? flourish in the colleges . The word " undergraduate " ? in certain periodicals ? has always an adjective linked to it , such as " uncouth , " " boisterous , " " noisy , " " ill-mannered . " We who live with him wonder why . Noisy and boisterous he is , but usually on highly proper occasions . He cheers at the theater instead of clapping ; personally I like it ; and the actors seem to like it , too . He improvises scratch quartets between lectures , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be occasionally when , in the presence of his elders , especially the women , he remembers that , after all , he is little more than a boy , and stumbles over a chair or pronounces with difficulty . Ill-mannered he certainly is not . The old days , when tutors were stoned in their rooms and bulldogs set on the lecturers , have gone , at least in the colleges with which I am familiar . Courtesy is as much a part of college custom as cleanliness ; the politeness of one 's class is a wall through which it is difficult to break . An insulting answer in a recitation-room is nearly as rare as a burst of tears . If a piece of chalk should hit me when my back was turned ? and in the old days they did not stop with chalk ? I should believe that it was an accident , and probably be right . It is true that courtesy is only a by-product of education , to use Dr. Wilson 's happy phrase . But there is more of it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is an old reproach against the college student that he is idle and lazy . Our present race of undergraduates are energetic beyond belief . Besides study ? and , in spite of the current opinion , all of them de study ? they are busy in a hundred directions . It was only recently that the faculty extorted an unwilling promise from the workers of the Yale News not to carry on their competition after midnight ! Football , baseball , the crew , mean hours every day of hard labor ( not fun , mind you ) for half the year at least . Fraternity campaigning leaves the men exhausted in mind and body at the end of the " rushing season ! ' The Y. M. C. A. , business managerships for the many organizations , to say nothing of the hundred activities by means of which the needy support themselves , make college life a whirl of action , in which only the negligible and the despised hang back . You must make an appointment , as with a corporation president , if you wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these efforts are well directed , that this is the ideal of academic leisure , I do not contend . But energy is certainly not a vice . CXXVI. ? No. 754. - 74 No one ? except the fat monks of the English monasteries ? criticized the Northmen for their energy . And there is even more energy in our colleges than in American life . But the great and shining virtue of the undergraduate is loyalty . At least one eminent philosopher thinks that in this word the greater virtues are summed . However that may be , wherever college life is sounded , in athletics , in friendship , in devotion to the college , in many regions Iess obvious , it seems to be compacted of loyalties . This it is , I believe , that makes our boys seem more earnest , while less serious , than the English student ; that makes them seem naive in contrast with older men who have lived in a world where ends are followed less blindly . The difference is not to their discredit . Once there came into my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken part in the revolution , and escaped with just his life and his revolutionary ardor . At first the contrast between this desperate idealist , who knew how to use weapons , manage men , risk lives for a cause , and these well-fed youngsters who had never conceived of any social order but their own , was almost ludicrous . When he spoke in his quirk , sharp voice , they squirmed uneasily in their seats . It seemed unfair that ideas ( for he had them ) should assail them on their unprotected rear ! But as I thought them over , the difference lessened . Their blind loyalty to one another , to their captains , to their college and its spirit , differed , after all , only in object and in maturity from his ; in its way was just as fine . I do not mean that the loyalty of the undergraduate appears in the form of emotion or sentimentality . Talk about " the dear old college " and " my old chum " has been given the expressive epithet " rah rah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the more sophisticated institutions . The undergraduate , indeed , has become a man of the world . He hides his feelings except et the football games ; his talk is , half of it , badinage ; and he is wonderfully successful at seeming to take life with no seriousness whatsoever . Furthermore , there are the cynics. and the prematurely mature , who wonder very rightly . like a character in a recent college novel , whether the college is n't there to serve them , and not they the college . Nevertheless , this subterranean loyalty flows under the whole college structure , and wells up in the most surprising persons and places . To act against the " spirit " of the place is the unpardonable sin . " He has a pretty poor spirit " is the current anathema . Not to come out for a team , or an editorial board , or a musical club , if one has the ability , is damning ? and almost incomprehensible . To be snobbish is to he unpopular ? not on moral grounds , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " being civil to one 's classmates " ) , which every American college believes that it alone conserves . To be lazy , to be over-studious , to be dissolute , to be spendthrift , all offend in some subtle or obvious fashion the spirit of loyalty . Loyalty unites itself in the subconsciousness with the desire for social honors ? the Mammon of our colleges -- and is an inextricable part of the ' motives of those whose chief ambition is to make this society or that . It accounts for much of the strength of college friendshifs . It is a powerful lever to keep a man up in the world after graduation , and many among us have been kept moving ahead by the old college feeling that one must be loyal to the expectations of one 's friends . In stories of broken - ribbed quarter-backs and water-logged crews the thing has been sentimentalized until it is hard to make it appear the simple fact of college life and the ail-pervading force that it is . But however we may dislike some of the results , or deplore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is folly and destruction to attack it , or depreciate in the least degree its remarkable value for American life . The energy and the loyalty of the undergraduate are like the waters of a mountain stream . Running wild , they are wasteful and dangerous , though , to complete the figure , highly picturesque . Dry them up , or fight them back , and you do no good to any one ; harness or direct them , and you will have a tremendous power at your command . But how ? I am not so rash as to attempt a final answer to that question . I am content at this point to maintain that until we prize what we have it is useless to criticize the undergraduate . And I hope to make clear that even then we must carry our criticism beyond an analysis of faults . These are said to be many and black . To begin with , it must be admitted , even by those who are most in sympathy with him , that much of his splendid energy is undeniably wasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is mere pedagoguery to suppose that all effort not directed toward intellectual development is wasted . Nevertheless , far too much of this college energy is burned as incense for the lesser gods . Interpret education as broadly as you will , even then it is difficult to reconcile the mad endeavor to do something and be something in the estimation of the little college community with any true function of the college . It is the approval of their classmates that our undergraduates seek , the approval and the material reward of approval : an election to a society , which means in this college world comfortable self-respect and an assured position , and in the next , the outer world , valuable friendships , useful connections that one does not have to wait for graduation to appreciate . Not that this approval is undesirable . You wish it for your son ? and no one can blame you . But a student body which seeks social recognition as an end is likely to be somewhat uncritical of the things which public opinion approves . It is hard enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of estimating their value . It is much easier to plunge along blindly , do what is expected of you , and drown your critical faculties in busyness , than to reason out the true serviceableness of your efforts for the college or yourself . They waste much of their energy , some of the best of these undergraduates , because their range of sympathies , of interests , of ambitions , is too narrow . No one expects a boy of seventeen , just entering college , to be especially broad-minded ; but though the vision of the Freshman and the Sophomore and the Junior grows clearer and truer , it broadens very slowly , and sometimes not at all . This last statement would be ludicrously - untrue of individuals . Of the majority of college students it is true . They are narrow in their sympathies ; and under existing conditions this is also not unnatural . Who expects the average youth of , say , twenty , to be thoroughly sympathetic with art , literature , music , research ; or with economies , politics , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have scarcely touched him at home ? As a thoughtful Senior once said : " In summer , when I go home , it seems as if no one outside cared about the things you try to interest us in here . " Fortunately we are on the eve of a " growing-up " of our student body . A great and important change has begun in our universities in the past ten years . One 's classes " feel " differently . They respond , however irregularly , to the intellectual , the scientific , the esthetic appeal . The symphony concerts , the good plays , the " outside lectures " have a larger and larger following . In the little Elizabethan Club just started at Yale , where for the first time ( here at least ) graduates and undergraduates meet updn an equal basis of club membership , the talk is various and good ; and the best talk , I think , comes from the boys . The undergraduate 's vision is narrow , but it is narrow because his sympathies are too often dormant ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideals that , with more justice , one complains of ? their ideals which the very blindness of their loyalty prevents them from estimating truly . I was present not long ago at a class meeting where certain leaders were urging the men to get out and do something worthy of their class . An eager youth jumped to his feet , ran his hands through his hair , and burst forth : " Look here , you fellows , there 's the Y. M. O. A. That 's a college activity . You ought to go to the meetings . You fellows that are n't out for the teams or the musical clubs ought to see whether you ca n't do something there . It 's a good thing , anyhow , and religious and all that ; but what I 'm saying is that it 's a college activity and ought to be supported . Where 's your spirit , anyhow ! " As I listened , I saw in imagination the spirit of the elder Dwight recoiling in horror from this profanity ; of the reverend president . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proclaim the blasphemer preordained to damnation . But it was not blasphemy.lily youth was speaking according to his lights . Supporting the college , as he understood it , was a duty beyond which he could not see . It is scarcely necessary to point out the effect of this uncritical loyalty upon the undergraduate 's attitude toward the curriculum . The results have often been described ? although often with more vehemence than truth . Let me say , however , as emphatically as I can say it . that the current idea of the student who never studies , never is interested in his work , is nonsense . A very respectable quantity of honest studying is accomplished in our American colleges . The observers who think differently are often deceived by the fashionable pose which dictates that a man shall say to his fellow , " Do n't know a thing about the lesson , " no matter bow hard he may have worked the night before . Neither in England nor in Germany ( at least in the universities ) are there so few men who get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for quality , that is a different question . Intellectual broadening , mental training , culture , and all that a college in its strict sense is designed to achieve , get just the loyalty and enthusiasm to which their place among the various " college activities " entitle them . They have a place . Only the men who do not count neglect them . But they stand below the extra-curriculum activities . They are overshadowed by the lesser gods . Again this applies to the mass only . Individuals , hundreds of them , do not come into the scope of this criticism . I could pick at a moment 's notice groups of men from this college to meet any objection ? whether of educator , esthete , man of the world , scholar , or business man ? which might be brought against college life and college education . Individuals , the student Dogberrys , whose ridiculous themes get into print , whose spellings are hawked about for the amusement of their elders , who write letters to the papers and sign themselves , " Yours respectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptions . They are the product not of the college , but of defective schools , or , more frequently , defective homes . Nevertheless , the immature , the dangerously narrow ideals are there , and they strongly affect , if they do not make , the public opinion of the undergraduate world . You can not blink them away , and they control and direct too much of the energy , too much of the loyalty , in itself above praise . Who is to blame ? First and foremost , only in small part , the undergraduate . He is a creature of his environment , past and present . The faculty , then ? In some measure , of course . Given a faculty of mighty teachers , men of intense personality , of real intellectual eminence , and we would send our false gods scurrying . They do retreat in every college before the attacks of this man or that who succeeds in making literature or economics as vital ( and this is difficult ) as baseball or a senior society . But a faculty made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? every man a potential general . It ca n't be done ? especially at the price we are willing to pay for them . Furthermore , many a professor enlisted for peace , not for war ; and when one considers what is expected from modern scholarship , who can blame him for disliking to spend all his energies in battle with those who do not care to learn ? Let us not excuse the faculty , however , but rather hold them in reserve for another discussion . Who else is to blame ? The schools ? Their problem is quite certainly the same as that of the colleges . We change the venue without settling the case by calling them into question . The parents and the home ? Here we seem to reach one terminal , at least . What did you send your son to college for ? To be educated , of course . But , in all honesty , what is the meaning of college education for you ? Were you not content to have him take a degree , without too close questioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the other hand , eager that he should live to the full the much-vaunted college life , achieving his part of popularity and social success ? Be sure that your half-expressed desires will become guiding principles for him . He knows and fears two public- opinions , his school 's and yours . If , in your guidance , a little conventional talk about doing well in his studies ( easily said and easily seen through ) fails to hide a far greater desire that he shall " make a society " and be popular in his class , how in any justice can you complain if the intellectual influences of the college pass over him and do no more than wet his plumage ? In your capacity of bank president or superintendent or lawyer , you ask for men who have been trained to think , who are mentally better and broader for their education . In your capacity of father , do you not send your boys to college with the well-understood agreement that they shall be straight , energetic , and socially successful ( admirable aims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall do nothing to prevent the faculty from educating them ? But no one was ever educated by merely consenting to the operation . The will to believe may be an end in itself ; the will to be educated is only the first step in the process . I do not wish to seem sourly pedagogical , or opposed to the joy of living which should be in the blood of every man in college , Nor would I minimize the enduring pleasure of college life , which , though a sentimental glamour may have been thrown upon it by the lime-Tight of romantic fiction , is certainly one of the most picturesque and most likable features of American life . If it came to a question between efficiency and happiness in college , I for one should hesitate . it is not a little thing to have felt the Falstaffian joy : " Gallants , lads , boys , hearts of gold , all the titles of good fellowship come to you ! What , shall we be merry ! " And it is not necessary to be Falstaff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not come to such a question . There is no fear that intellectual interests will make joyless , sallow bookworms of our undergraduates . As a figure in argument , the " grind " has been overworked . He exists , of course , but his real activity is in the mind of the bluffer , the shirker of intellectual labor , who , imagining a soulless engine quite different from the mild and plodding original , shudders at what he has escaped . There is no danger of suppressing the fun in college life . It is unsuppressible . One wonders if there might not be even a little more if the competition for teams and crews were less killing : if there were more time for the imagination to play . The successful men in college do not seem to be very happy . Most of them ? especially the athletes ? are overworked ! It is a concerted attempt by faculty and parents that we need . A model curriculum will not do it . We have altered and systematized our curriculums , since the break-up of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency should have increased fifty per cent . Teaching in nearly all subjects has had energy poured into it , until one expects every year to see some result commensurate with the expenditure of devotion , and in no satisfying way discovers one . In truth , we have to work harder at our teaching than in the days when more students were eager to be taught ? and that we have kept the colleges from going backward is at least not discreditable . But in so far as all this regards methods and systematization , it is just machinery , effective and laudable , but machinery . We have splendid devices for leading the horse to water ? but he must wish to taste of the Pierian spring before we can make him drink . It is upon the aims and the ideals of the boy that we must work . Send him to college believing that you believe in broadening the intellect , in training the mind , in deepening the appreciation of life , and it will be relatively easy ( for no healthy animal likes the preliminary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the colleges , see to it that your boys respect the fruits of education when they arrive . And yet it is unjust to fall into the scolding vein and charge our fathers and mothers with conditions for which they are only partly responsible . The final explanation of our difficulty is to be found in the peculiar social and intellectual circumstances of American life in this generation ; and this is at the same time the most encouraging and the most discouraging feature of the situation . No need to repeat at length what has often been said . Bred of democracy , fostered by the best in our national ambitions , a passionate desire to educate every one first built up our school system , and then burst upon the colleges . This was good ; but it has been followed and accompanied by an equally passionate desire on the part of a prosperous generation to set the mark of gentility upon its sons . And the easiest , because the most recognized way , has been to send them to college . To criticize the desire is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so often ? it has been blind ; when the college has been regarded as a finishing-school , and the nature of the desired finish determined upon grounds in which real intellectual training and true culture have had small part , then the results are what T have been trying to outline in the previous paragraphs . It is an error not unlike that of the undergraduate : an admirable ambition , prompted by loyalty to the American spirit , backed by praiseworthy energy , directed toward a goal over which our educational leaders shake their heads . Well , it is not so black a business as the excited rhetoric into which a teacher naturally falls ( and here apologizes for ) would make it appear . God 's in His heaven , a great deal of excellent education is squeezing somehow or other into the pores of an awe-inspiring number of fine young fellows . If it were not that the days of easy success were passing ; if it were not that the English , the French , and the German competition was beginning to mean something ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our country , are finding that we do not yet know how to live in it , why , then there would be little sense in all this sound and fury . But all these things are true , and soon will be pressing . What is the remedy ? In principle , it is very simple ; in detail and practice , excessively difficult ; and it is quite beyond my power or my purpose to turn it into a formula to fit the manifold conditions of our many colleges . Surely the remedy is to guide the current instead of fighting against it . Bergson has convinced many of us that the Clan vital , the life-force , is far too subtle to be comprehended by the mathematical laws of science . And the boy is the clan vital ! We must realize that these waves of misguided enthusiasm which beat through our colleges are part of the national life , and can not be made to run backward . We must swing their energy toward some worthy purpose . It is a weary thing for the tired teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business and scientific energy of the country ( for it is just that which the undergraduate displays in his blind and immature fashion ) . We must intellectualize it as a century ago the colleges intellectuaiized the professional and theological energy . And we must teach the student how to live , not the life of Greece or Rome or Victorian England , but the life his time and his country allow him . In comparison , it is relatively easy to make the undergraduate feel that the things of the mind are at least as interesting as the things of the body . But to do this we must have teachers of the first water ; we must have , above all , the influences of the home back of us . We must have time and intelligent support . In the meanwhile ? even though the Pharisees rage ? do not be too severe upon our strenuous , lovable undergraduate . Do not minimize college life ; rather help us to vitalize it . Along toward the end of Senior year they begin to come out to see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be fond of . And after a cigarette or two , and a preliminary skirmish on the prospects of the crew , or last summer in Switzerland , or some new book , out comes the real difficulty . They are nervous about next year . They feel hopelessly incapable , untrained , ignorant . The things they have learned to do well have lost their price . Of course they joke about it , and so do you , but the feeling is there underneath . It is then that you realize most keenly their mistakes and your own ; then that you feel what a delicate mechanism a man is , and how difficult to throw into gear . And it is only when they are leaving , only when they begin to wake up to what will be required of them , that they reach the mood for education , the mood in which even we blundering professors could make education a success ! This is what I regret .                  @ @ @
