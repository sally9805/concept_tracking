As a Realist Sees It Of Human Bondage , by W. Somerset Maugham . New York : George H. Doran Co. $1.50 net . S in retrospect of a great book the mind L. / falters , confused by the multitude and yet the harmony of the detail , the strangeness of the frettings , the brooding , musing intelligence that has foreseen , loved , created , elaborated , perfected , until , in this middle ground which we call life , somewhere between nothing and nothing , hangs the perfect thing which we love and can not understand , but which we are compelled to confess a work of art . It is at once something and nothing , a dream , a happy memory , a song , a benediction . In viewing it one finds nothing to criticise or to regret . The thing sings , it has color . It has rapture . You wonder at the loving , patient care which has evolved it . Only recently I finished reading Mr. W. Somerset Maugham 's " Of Human Bondage . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down . In recent years , and quite definitely , we have been getting on in a literary way . Despite our complaints ay to the intolerance of a philistine age , many interesting things are being done . In England particularly in the last few years ( though France has produced " Jean Christophe " ) we have had George Moore , all of him ; " The New Machiavelli " of Wells , " Fortitude " by Hugh Walpole , " The Old Wives ' Tale , " by Arnold Bennett , " Sinister Street " by Compton Mackenzie , " The New Grub Street " by Gissing , " Joseph Stahl " by J. D. Beresford , and also such minor volumes as " The Rat Pit " by Patrick MacGill , and " Mushroom Town " by Oliver Onions . ( What a name 1 ) In America , on the other hand , we have lagged . There have been " Predestined " by Stephen French Whitman , " Quicksand " by Hervey White , " The Story of Eva " by Will Payne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " With the Procession " by H. B. Fuller , and " Me-Teague " by Frank Norris , but all of these , transcendent as are their narrative merits , are lacking somehow in that vast undercurrent of which these newer and more forceful writers seem cognizant . Here is a novel or biography or autobiography or social transcript of the utmost importance . To begin with it is unmoral , as a novel of this kind must necessarily be . The hero is born with a club foot , and in consequence , and because of a temperament delicately attuned to the miseries of life , suffers all the pains , recessions , and involute self tortures which only those who have striven handicapped by what they have considered a blighting defect can understand . He is a youth , therefore , with an intense craving for sympathy and understanding . He must have it . The ' thought of his lack and the part which his disability plays in it soon becomes an obsession . He is tortured , miserable . In pursuit of his ideal from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pathetic way , a truly moving spectacle . The story begins at the home of his mother in or near London . She is dying , and among the last things she does is to feel the deformed foot of her son , with what thoughts we may well imagine . ' Later in the home of his uncle , William Carey , vicar of Blackstable in Kent , we find him suffering for want of sympathy and concealing his shyness and desire behind a veil of assumed indifference . By Carey and his wife he is fostered in a somewhat stern way until his schooldays at Tercenbury begin . There he is tortured by unfeeling playmates , unconscious of the agony which his deformity causes him , until he is ready to leave for a higher school , and presumably prepare himself for the ministry . Study , and an innate opposition to the life , decide him to leave and go to Heidelberg , Germany , where apparently he remains for a year and rids himself of all his early religious beliefs . A little later he returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office of a chartered accountant in London , for which privilege he pays . If anyone has ever given a better description of English clerkly life I am not aware of it . After a year he gives this up , finding himself unsuited to it , and essays art , the suggestions and enthusiasms of certain friends impelling him to it . Two years of the Latin Quarter , Paris , and the fierce discussions which rage around the newer movements in art make it clear to him that he is unsuited for that field , and with sense of defeat he gives it up . A few months later he enters a medical school in London with a view to becoming a physician . It is here that his loneliness and his passion for sympathy drive him into a weird relationship with a waitress in an A B C restaurant in London which eventually eats up the remainder of his small fortune of twelve hundred pounds . Finally , penniless and destitute , sleeping on park benches for days , he is compelled to enter a London shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found . " Those who place so much faith in the intellectual supremacy of the English and their right to lead the world on to Elysian fields of perfection might study the picture which he gives of underworld clerk life with profit . There is no more degrading form of wage slavery practised by any nation , civilized or uncivilized . Two years of this and then the vicar of Blackstable dies , leaving him a competence of six hundred pounds wherewith he is able to restore himself to his medical studies . In four years more he has acquired his diploma , and is now ready to become a general practitioner . Curiously the story rises to no spired climax . To some it has apparently appealed as a drab , unrelieved narrative . To me at least it is a gorgeous weave , as interesting and valuable at the beginning as at the end . There is material in its three hundred thousand and more words for , many novels and indeed several philosophies , and even a religion or stoic hope . There are a series of women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case may be ? who lead him through the mazes of sentiment , sex , love , pity , passion , a wonderful series of portraits and of incidents . There are a series of men friends of a peculiarily inclusive range of intellectuality and taste , who lead him , or whom he leads , through all the intricacies of art , philosophy , criticism , humor . And lastly comes life itself , the great land and sea of people , England , Germany , France , battering , corroding , illuminating , a Goyaesque world . Naturally I asked myself how such a book would be received in America , in England . In the latter country I was sure , with its traditions of the Athenaeum and the Saturday Review , it would be adequately appreciated . Imagine my surprise to find that the English reviews were almost uniformly contemptuous and critical on moral and social grounds . The hero was a weakling , not for a moment to be tolerated by sound , right-thinking men . On the other hand in America the reviewers for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Need I say , however , that the New York World finds it " the sentimental servitude of a poor fool " ; or that the Philadelphia Press sees fit to dub it " futile Philip " or that the Outlook feels that " the author might have made his hook true without making it so frequently distasteful " ; or that the Dial cries , " a most depressing impression of the futility of life " ? " No brilliancy of style , " mourns the Detroit Times . " Young folks are warned off , " urges the Portland Oregonian . ( As if that young person could be induced to examine so profound and philosophic a work ! ) - " Certainly the story can not be said to be in any sense a wholesome one , and it would require a distinctly morbid taste for one to enjoy it thoroughly . " ( Note the " thoroughly " ) . This from the New Orleans Times-Picayune . " One longs after reading these novels where spineless men and women yield without a struggling to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . It is too trite . You must judge for yourself how the reviewer on the Saturday Evening Post of Burlington , Ia. , felt about it . Despite these dissonant voices it is still a book of the utmost import , and has so been received . Compact of the experiences , the dreams , the hopes , the fears , the disillusionments , the ruptures , and the philosophisings of a strangely starved soul , it is a beacon light by which the wanderer may be guided . Nothing is left out ; the author writes as though it were a labor of love . It bears the imprint of an eager , almost consuming desire to say truly what is in his heart . Personally I found myself aching with pain when , yearning for sympathy , Philip begs the wretched Mildred , never his mistress but on his level , to no more than tolerate him . He finally humiliates himself to the extent of exclaiming , " You do n't know what it means to be a cripple ! " The pathos of it plumbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sixteen-year-old mother in the slum , of Cronshaw , and the rambling agonies of old Ducroz and of Philip himself , are perfect in their appeal . There are many other and all equally brilliant pictures . No one short of a genius could rout the philosophers from their lairs and label them as individuals " tempering life with rules agreeable to themselves , " or could follow Mildred Rogers , waitress of the London A B C restaurant , through all the shabby windings of her tawdry soul . No other than a genius endowed with an immense capacity for understanding and pity could have sympathized with Fannie Price , with her futile and self-destructive art dreams ; Or old Cronshaw , the wastrel of poetry and philosophy ; or Mons. Ducroz , the worn-out revolutionary ; or Thorne Athelny , the caged grandee of Spain ; or Leonard Upjohn , airy master of the art of self advancement ; or Dr. South , the vicar of Blackstable , and his wife ? these are master-Pieces . They are marvelous portraits ; they are as smooth as a Vermeer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving as a Rembrandt . The study of Carey himself , while one sees him more as a medium through which the others express themselves , still registers photographically at times . He is by no means a brooding voice but a definite , active , vigorous character . If the book can be said to have a fault it will lie for some in its length , 3oopoo words , or for others in the peculiar reticence with which the last love affair in the story is handled . Until the coming of Sallie Athelny all has been described with the utmost frankness . No situation , however crude or embarrassing , has been shirked . In the matter of the process by which he arrived at the intimacy which resulted in her becoming pregnant not a word is said . All at once , by a slight frown which she subsequently explains , the truth is forced upon you that there has been a series of intimacies which have not been accounted for . After Mildred Rogers and his relationship with Norah Nesbit it strikes one as strange . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it now , much as old Cronshaw in the story felt about the rug which was to clarify for Carey the meaning of life : As the weaver elaborated his pattern for no end but the pleasure of his aesthetic sense , so might a man live his life , or , if he was forced to believe that his actions were outside his choosing , so might a man look at his life , that it made a pattern . There was little need to do this or there was little need to do that . It was merely something that he did for his own pleasure . Out of the manifold events of his life , his deeds , his feelings , his thoughts , he might make a design , regular , elaborated , complicated or beautiful ; and though it might be no more than an illusion that he had the power of selection , that did not matter ; it seemed and so to him it was . In the vast warp of life , with the background to his fancies that there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a personal satisfaction in selecting the various strands that worked out the pattern . . .. What happened to him now would be one more motive to add to the complexity of the pattern , and when the end approached he would rejoice in its completion . It would be a work of art and it would be none the less beautiful because he alone knew of its existence , and with his death it would at once cease to be . And so it is , Mr. Maugham , this life of Philip Carey as you have woven it . One feels as though one were sitting before a splendid Shiraz or Daghestan of priceless texture and intricate weave , admiring , feeling , responding sensually to its colors and tones . Or better yet it is as though a symphony of great beauty by a master , Strauss or Beethoven , had just been completed and the bud notes and flower tones were filling the air with their elusive message , fluttering and dying . Mr. Maugham , as I understand it , has written eleven conventional books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , as the paragraph quoted suggests , he has lived willing that the large knowledge which this book reveals should remain unseen and even perish with him . For all of that he is none the less a great artist . Vicariously , it seems to me , he has suffered for the joy of the many who are to read after him . By no willing of his own he has been compelled to take life by the hand and go down where there has been little save sorrow and degradation . The cup of gall and wormwood has obviously been lifted to his lips and to the last drop he has been compelled to drink it . Because of this we are enabled to see the rug , woven of the tortures and the delights of a life . We may actually walk and talk with one whose hands and feet have been pierced with nails .
