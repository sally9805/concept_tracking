txt // men had thrown out under the dead-line pieces of mouldy bread and cake . This man had one hand on the dead-line , and was reaching under to obtain some of those pieces of mouldy bread or cake to eat , and was fired on by the guard and shot through the head . He was killed instantly . He was on the north side of the stockade ; his body lay partly under the dead-line after he was shot . In the other case I did not see the man shot , but I saw him immediately after he was shot . He was brought to the hospital ; he had been shot by one of the guard , it was said . I did not see him shot . I did not see him on the ground before he was taken up ? not until he was taken to the hospital . I have seen a pack of hounds at that prison . I have seen Captain Wirz and a man named Turner bring them down to the hospital and start them round it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any prisoner who had escaped during the night previous . I never saw them attack any prisoner ? I never saw any person who had been bitten by them . As a general thing I thought that Captain Wirz was rather overbearing , and very profane and abusive in his language toward our men , on the slightest provocation . I never saw him buck any man ? 1 have seen men bucked by his orders . I heard the orders given . I have heard orders given for men to be bucked . Dr. F. G. Castlen , a rebel surgeon on duty at the prison , testified I saw one man who had been bitten by the dogs . I saw the dogs bite him . I saw the dogs running down the swamp below my camp .

He came down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there with the hounds . The prisoners were being removed to Savannah in August or September . I do n't know which . It was the last part of August , or the first part of September , I think . The prisoners , at the time of this assault , were standing in fro , t of Captain Wirz 's headquarters . There was not a large crowd around the prisoners . I did not see a large crowd ; there were a good many prisoners . There was no disturbance that I saw , except this man falling out of ranks . I was at that spot half an hour , I suppose . Captain Wirz struck the man with his right hand . I do not know whether Captain Wirz was or was not to blame for the awful condition of the prison . I never saw any other acts of violence by Captain Wirz , excepting what I have described . I never knew of any other . It was about the first of August that I saw Captain Wirz pursue a prisoner with the hounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prison . I did not see him set those dogs on that man . I do n't know who set them on . I did not see him in the water up to his knees trying to prevent the dogs from biting that man . I did not see him making any attempts to keep the dogs from biting that man . I did not see him seize that dog . I was from twenty to thirty feet from him , I suppose . It was woody in the swamp , but not outside . The man was in the swamp . When he came down from the tree the dogs seized him , and they bit him after he came out of the swamp . I do not know that Captain Wirz set the dogs on him after he came out . I do not know that the biting of the dogs was // accidental . I just saw them bite him . The dogs were common fox-hounds .

I do not know what his duties were officially at Andersonville . I saw acts of cruelty committed by Captain Wirz on one or two occasions . At one time the prisoners were being removed , I think to Savannah . One prisoner was out of the ranks ; Captain Wirz jerked and struck him , I think , once or twice ; do n't remember how many times , but I think once or twice . TESTIMONY OF ANDREW J. SPRING . Andrew J. Spring , private in the 16th Connecticut Volunteers , was taken to Afidersonville in May , 1864 . He testified : 1 I saw the hounds exercised ; I saw them several times when they were taking men 's trails , but I saw them one time when they caught a man ; I think it was about the last of August or the first of September that I saw a man who had been brought in by Captain Wirz , and this man Turner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitten very badly . Captain Wirz went over the hill . The man was brought around by the bakery . I was well acquainted with the guard , at least by sight , and I asked him where the man was caught . He said he was caught over here by Captain Wirz and Turner , the man who had charge of the hounds ; that the man was in a tree and was shaken down out of it . I saw a chain-gang there ; I have seen them every day ; there were thirteen of them in it at one time ; they were in two ranks ; each man had a chain and shackle around each ankle , a chain going from the front side of the ankle to the next one before him , both legs shackled so that they could step but eight or ten inches at a time . The men had to keep step with each other . Each man had a small ball ( I do not know the weight of it ) outside the leg , which he had to carry in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball to every four men . There was a large shackle around the neck with a large chain , much larger than that fastened to the legs , around their necks , reaching around the circle . I have known one man to be reduced so low that he was taken from there and sent to the hospital ; I can not tell his name ; I can not tell what date ; he was taken to the hospital and soon after died . I should think this was some time about the middle of August . These men were put in the chain-gang for trying to make their escape . I saw a man shot there . I never saw the prisoner give orders to shoot men . There was one man shot there on the 15th of May , from the first sentry-box next the south gate . The man who was shot was inside the dead-line , or I suppose he was . I saw the man shot and I saw him after he was shot . I was on the north side of the stockade . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The man lay inside the dead-line . About the time I got over there Captain Wirz was in the sentry-box with the guard . Directly after that Captain Wirz came inside the stockade . He drew out his revolver and swore he would shoot all the men there if they did not get away from the gate , and the men scattered . 1 do not know that I saw any communication between Captain Wirz and the // sentinel . When he stood in the sentry-box he was close to the sentinel ; the sentry-box was not more than four feet square . I saw another man shot there . A short time after that ? perhaps six or eight days ? there was a man who was asleep under his blanket in the middle of the day . The stockade being so crowded , he had to lie near the dead-line . This man , while he was asleep rolled over under the dead-line . As soon as he rolled under it he was shot . That was in May , I think , from the 20th to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him instantly . I do not think he knew what hurt him . I do not know his name . I did not see the prisoner at that place then . The ball struck the first man I spoke of in the temple and went down into his breast . He was taken off to the hospital , which was then inside the stockade , and he died on his way to the hospital . He was not a sound man ; he was a cripple , a one-legged man . I have seen our darky prisoners hauled up there and receiving from fifty to seventy-five lashes a number of times ; to the Court : I mean our negro soldiers . I can speak of one of them in particular ; one of them was sick and refused to go to work . The man who had charge of the gang at that time ? I forget his name ? reported the matter to Captain Wirz . Captain Wirz came along and ordered the negro to be taken up to the stocks and whipped ; I forget the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . I believe that the man who whipped him was named Humes ; he was generally called quartermaster , but was nothing but a private soldier , as I understood , to issue rations from the bakery to our men in the stockade . He used to go in with the wagon and issue the rations . TESTIMONY OF NAZARETH ALLEN . Nazareth Allen , a rebel soldier on duty at Andersonville , testi-fied:1 I have seen the stocks , and seen men in them ; I have seen several put in the stocks , and some ten or twelve in the chain-gang ; I know that one prisoner died in the chain-gang or stocks ; I wo n't be certain which , but I think in the stocks ; I think it was some time in August , 1864 ; I do not know what his sickness was ; he appeared to be sick when I saw him ; I saw him only once or twice , and afterwards I saw him dead ; I do n't recollect how long afterwards ; I was passing there almost every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was confined in the stocks ; there were several in the stocks ; I do not know why this man was placed in the stocks ; I think it was for trying to escape . The stocks were between Captain Wirz 's headquarters and the stockade , on the road you would take in going to the stockade . Once I saw a prisoner step out from the ranks to speak to Captain Wirz for an exchange into a mess , when they were counting them out ; he had made an agreement with one of his fellow prisoners to go into the other mess . He lacked one or two of getting to him , and he stepped out to speak to him . Captain Wirz ordered him back and threatened to shoot him . He did not shoot him ; he threatened to shoot and he cursed him . // I do n't know how many hounds there were ; I have seen about eight at a time . They were common plantation hounds ; they are hounds trained to run people ; I guess these dogs were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not see them trained ; they were common-sized dogs , about half as high as this railing about four feet high . They were common hounds , such as you find on all the plantations of the South ; I think they were nothing more or less . They did not appear to be particularly ugly or savage , more than a common hound , so far as I saw . I never saw them pursuing any one ; I have heard them at it ; heard them crying in the woods . They made a noise like a hound ; I can not exactly imitate it . I have seen a hound pursue game . I have never heard them cry in the same way when they were not pursuing game as they do while pursuing it . There is a particular sound when they are pursuing ; I can not describe that particular sound ; it is a more ferocious sound than when they are pursuing in sport . I never saw a man bitten by those dogs . TESTIMONY OF CAPTAIN IIEATII . John F. Meath , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macon , Georgia . I have been in the Confederate service . In 1861 I was in the 20th regiment Georgia Volunteers . I was commissary , with the rank of captain . In April , 1864 , I was in the Georgia Reserve Corps . I was on duty at Andersonville from May till October , 1864 . I know the prisoner ; I have seen him at Andersonville . I understood that he commanded the prison at Andersonville . I never received any orders from him directly . I was never on duty at the prison but one day . There were thirteen prisoners sent over from headquarters to be ironed . I think it was in August ; I was officer of the day . They were sent over to me from the provost marshal 's office , to have them ironed ; they were not ironed on that day ; I think on the second or third day afterwards twelve of them were ironed . The men were sent over under guard , with an order from Captain Wirz . There was one man chained in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was chained . I could not say to my certain knowledge what became of him . I know that I saw him several days afterwards very sick ; every man who was chained with him objected to it . The man had the diarrhoea ; I should judge so from the looks of his clothes , and he was very lousy ; I could see from a distance the lice crawling over him . His comrades objected to being chained with him , because of his condition . Their objections were not heeded ; he was chained with them . I do not know that their complaint ever went to Captain Wirz ; they objected to being chained by the side of such a man . He was the last of them I think that was chained . They had to all travel at the same time and for all purposes . I can not say to my certain knowledge what became of the sick man . I think this took place in the month of August , 1864 . At the time that these thirteen men were to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him " Little Frenchy " ; a hound was put , upon his track . I ran down 10 the little swamp , between a quarter and a half mile off . Just as I got to the swamp T heard a shot from a pistol , and I saw the man in a tree . Captain Wirz cane up and ordered the man to come down . The man begged the dogs should not lin Iot hurt : him . He made the man come down , and with that the // dogs rushed at him . I could see the dogs run up and grab him by the legs . Captain Wirz did not try to keep the dogs off from the man ; he could have done so . I do not know who fired the pistol ; I only heard the report . The prisoner was sent with a gang two days before to be chained . He was not chained afterwards . I saw him two or three days afterwards in the guard quarters , without the chains upon him ; I saw him sitting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not notice his wounds ; I was not near enough to him to see whether he had wounds or not . I have seen Captain Wirz kick two or three prisoners . I can not tell for what reason , except that he got a little excited . At one time , I think it was when they were moving from Andersonville , I saw him kick a prisoner . To the best of my recollection it was the case of a man who was trying to get out of a squad to which he did not belong . I think it was in September , 1864 . TESTIMONY OF WILLIAM DILLARD . William Dillard , a rebel soldier on duty at Andersonville , testified : 1 I guarded twelve prisoners in the chain-gang one day and night . One of them was sick and very low , and had to run out every five or ten minutes , and the others were wanting him turned out of the gang because he wanted to run out so much . I think he was taken out about dark . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know he was in from the morning when I went on guard . He was in a sick condition all that day . I can not say what sort of a day it was . It was in August . I can not say what became of the prisoner , except from hearsay . I do not know where he was taken after he was released from the chaingang . It was all the man could do to stand alone when he was taken away from there . I never saw him after that . I heard what became of him from some of the boys next day . Hounds were kept there to catch prisoners trying to make their escape and our own men also . I saw them catch a man called " Frenchy . " I was walking my post and I suppose some 300 yards off . I saw Captain Wirz and Reid , the provost marshal , and the man with the dogs , hunting up and down before they started on the man 's track .

I could not say whether the man was hurt by the dogs only from hearsay . I saw the dogs running down the branch before they treed him . I did not see them when they were at him at all . I have seen several men in the stocks . I have seen some fastened by their feet and lying exposed to the heat of the sun and to the rain . I saw one man fastened by the neck and with his arms extended , who had no hat on ; I do . not know how long he was in there . I never saw any one in the stocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footnote 1 Record , p. 124. // TESTIMONY OF CALVIN HUNEYCUTT . Calvin Huneycutt , a rebel soldier , testified : 1 I reside in Bibb County , Georgia ; I was in the Confederate service from April , 1864 , till April , 1865 ; I was on duty at Andersonville about five months , I reckon ; I went there in May , 1864 , and stayed until September or October , I believe . I know Captain Wirz ; I have heard him abuse the prisoners and draw his pistol to shoot them ; but I never saw him shoot any one . I have seen him kick them , in July , I believe , for not standing up in ranks , when Captain Wirz was counting them off ; the man was sick ; he looked like it ; I do not know what was the reason he did not stand up only that ; he was not trying to escape . I have heard Captain Wirz threaten to shoot prisoners at the time he drew his pistol ; it was when they were brought there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them off . There was one who did not stand up in the ranks , and the captain drew his pistol and said he would shoot him if he did not stand upright ; he kicked him a little , not much ; the soldier looked sick ; I do not know what was the matter with him . I recollect the man they called " Frenchy " trying to escape ; he was caught by the hounds ; I saw him after he was caught ; he was torn by the hounds pretty badly , in the leg ; I think it occurred in August ; I do not know whether he was put in irons ; I saw him when he was brought up to Captain Wirz 's headquarters . Captain Wirz was with him , as well as I can recollect , and the man who kept the hounds ; I saw where the hounds tore the man ; it had the appearance of a dog-bite . I guarded the prisoners in the chain-gang for one or two days and nights ; I do not know how long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they were in there every time I saw them ; I do not know that they were exactly the same men ; I do not know how long any one man was kept in the chain-gang ; I have no idea ; they were kept there while I was on guard ; I was on guard twice a day and a night at a time ; they were in there during that time ; they were not changed during the time ; I know of an instance where one of them became very sick in the chain-gang ; I know that the rest of the men who were chained to him complained of his being sick and wanted him loosed , he bothered them so much in going out ; I do not know how long he was kept in the chain-gang , nor what became of him . I did not see the chains taken off ; I do not recollect any others confined in the stocks or chain-gang who were sickly ; I think that one of them had six men in it and the other had twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off one prisoner and he got away one night and he escaped , but they caught him and brought him back ; I mean the man himself cut off the chains ; I do not know of any instance when the rebel authorities had to cut off the chains by reason of their affecting the prisoner . I saw one of the prisoners whipped ; I did not count the strokes , but to the best of my knowledge it was about twenty-five or thirty . I do not know who it was that was whipped ; he was a white man , a prisoner of war ; I saw a man cone from ( ' aptain Wirz 's headquarters , who took him out and whipped him ; // I do not know his name ; he was an officer ; the whipping commenced right straight away after he came out ; the officer walked down and carried the man off with a couple of guards ; I did not hear the officer say anything at the time .

The prisoners who died were buried in a trench , side by side , with the dirt thrown over them , with no covering , without any box ; I should judge the trench was about two or three feet deep ; I was standing on post one day when they were taking bodies out ; they had been there so long that when they were brought out and put in the wagon they burst , something broke inside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very badly . TESTIMONY OF JAMES MOHAN . James Mohan , a rebel soldier , testified I have been in the Confederate service only as a private . I was afterwards elected a second lieutenant in the 3d Georgia Reserves . I was on duty at Andersonville for about five months ? May , June , July , August , September , and up to , I believe , the 13th of October , 1864 . I was not much around the stockade . I was appointed assistant provost marshal for a time , and my business was with my own men , running up and down the trains , examining passports , etc . I had nothing to do with the prison except sending over prisoners that arrived there , and prisoners that had escaped and were caught and brought to the provost marshal 's office . I would send my guard over to Captain Wirz 's headquarters with the prisoners by order from the provost marshal . I did not receive any orders at all in regard to the treatment of prisoners . The disposition of them was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sole charge of them . I received orders on that subject from the provost marshal . He was under General Winder . Captain Wirz was then commander of the inner prison ; he had charge of all the prisoners that came down there . I had something to do with putting chains on prisoners . The prisoners were brought from Captain Wirz 's headquarters to the provost marshal 's office by a guard . The provost marshal ordered me to take charge of the guard up to the blacksmith 's shop . T went up there with the prisoners to take charge of the guard , and to see also that the prisoners got their irons on . There was a verbal order on that subject . A sergeant of Captain Wirz came over with the prisoners from his office . It was to see that these men had balls and chains put on them and linked together with a sort of a collar around their neck and a chain attached to it . T took over thirteen men . The collars were not ready that day and I sent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told a lieutenant under me to take them over and to state to Captain Wirz that the irons were not ready . Those were // the orders I received from the foreman of the shop ? to tell Captain Wirz that the irons were not ready . The next day the men were sent over there , but I did not take them . I saw them coming down the hill with balls and chains on them , linked together . When I was sending the prisoners over to Captain Wirz 's headquarters a young man whom they called " Frenchy " escaped . He was not put in the gang afterwards . The gang consisted of twelve men . In the evening " Frenchy " was recaptured . When this lieutenant who was under me carried the men over it was found that there were only twelve men . Wirz got on his horse and rode over . He said : " that damned Frenehy has escaped again ; send for the dogs . " The dogs came and got on the trail of him and recaptured him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stockade . Captain Wirz did not ride off with the dogs ; he got off his horse and walked . He went alongside the dogs ; that is , when the dogs got down across the stream , the dogs went one way and he went another , along with Captain Reed , the provost marshal , searching for this man . I was standing on a platform at the depot and I saw where he stood , and heard the howling of these dogs around the tree . It seemed as if the prisoner was up there . I did not see him . I looked around again to see where Captain Wirz was and I heard the report of a pistol and saw the flash . I should judge the flash came from Captain Wirz . After firing , they captured the prisoner and took him to the guard tent . I know that he was injured . I saw him a day or two afterwards . His pantaloons were torn on the leg and he looked sickly . I do n't know whether his flesh was torn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why he was not put in the chain-gang . I heard he was badly bitten from some of my brother officers there , after the affair happened , when we were talking about it . The dogs were common hounds . I believe there were a couple of them called catchdogs ; the others were hounds . The technical name is fox-hound . They call some of them track-hounds there . I believe there are track-hounds and catch-dogs ; I am not much acquainted in the dog line . One is very vicious by nature . I do n't think the other is very dangerous . The catch-dog is vicious . I very frequently heard Captain Wirz remark that he wished the prisoners were all in hell and he with them . Sometimes they would offend him or something like that in his office ? he would say it if any prisoners would make him angry around his quarters or around the stockade , or anywhere else where he was . There were a large lot of paroled prisoners outside ? four or five hundred , I presume . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was officer of the guard when I first went down there . That was before my assignment as assistant provost marshal . I received instructions from Captain Wirz 's adjutant at the stockade . He read the instructions to the guard and turned the papers over to me , or when I was relieved the next morning , to the officer who relieved me . The instructions in regard to the dead-line were that we were not to allow any of the prisoners to cross it ; that if they crossed it they were to be fired on by the sentinels . That was the substance of the instructions . I did not have occasion to observe the condition of the prison very well while I was on duty there ; it was a place I never liked to go into . // TESTIMONY OF O. S. BELCHER . O. S. Belcher , private 16th Illinois Cavalry , was a prisoner from March until September . He testified : 1 I heard Captain Wirz say that he could kill more Yankees there than they were killing at the front . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men who had said something to him . He got so at the last that he dare not come over on our side of the prison at all . He could not come unless he had 300 or 400 men with him . I saw men shot on the dead-line or crossing it ; I have seen a number of men shot . I have seen 25 or 30 killed in that way , shot in different places around the stockade ; some were over the dead-line , and some were shot who were not near it . TESTIMONY OF JAMES K. DAVIDSON . James K. Davidson , 4th Iowa Cavalry , was a prisoner at Andersonville from March , 1864.2 Many prisoners died in the stockade . The hospital was then within the stockade ; the dead men were carried on stretchers out to the gate , and from there they were hauled to the graveyard in wagons . Part of the time I was employed outside the stockade chopping wood , and part of the time driving a wagon from the hospital to the graveyard ; I drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; not two weeks , I think ; there were two teams of us driving ; we would each have from 50 to 75 men per day ; we would throw them in the wagon just as we would wood ; sometimes there were 20 or 25 at a load ; we drove the same wagons back to the stockade loaded ? sometimes with wood for the prisoners , sometimes with rations . We would go by way of the depot sometimes and get rations in the same wagon in which we carried dead bodies ; those were the orders , I believe , from the quartermaster or the man who had charge of the teams ; I believe his name was Duncan ; I think he was an officer ; he had charge of the cook-house . I have heard Captain Wirz say that he was killing more damned Yankees there than Lee was at Richmond . That was said in August ; he was in my wagon at the time ; I had been to the graveyard with the dead men . I have seen men who were starved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I saw men eating food that they took from the ground ; I have seen men pick up and eat undigested food that had passed through other men ; they would find it all through the camp ; it came from men who were not able to go to the slough , and they would find it all through the camp . I saw the chain-gang ; I have seen from twelve to fourteen men in the chaingang ; it was a common thing to see the men in the chain-gang ; I never saw men in the chain-gang under a tent ; they were kept out in the hot sun ; I saw one man die in the chain-gang ; I believe he was buried with the iron collar round his neck ; this was in August , I think , the first part of the month ; T do not know the man 's name . // I saw hounds there ; there were six to nine that I saw every morning ; they were used for catching prisoners , I suppose ; they had them after teem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hound and the catch-dog , as he was called ; I guess he was a bull terrier or something of that kind ; he resembled that somewhat ; I do n't know why he was called a " catch-dog .

I saw two men shot there by the guards ; I do not know the names of either of them ; it was down on the east side of the stockade near the branch ; the man had been washing his clothes and was hanging them on the guard line to dry ; one of the garments blew over the dead-line ; he reached through to pick it up , when the guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last of March or the first of April , 1864 .

The other man was killed instantly ; he was shot in the breast ; the second man was shot in the head ; I do not know his name ; I heard shots fired of which I did not see the effects ; I suppose the shots were fired by the sentinels ; it was a very frequent occurrence . No conversation at all led to the remark that he was killing more Yankees than Lee . I believe that same morning he had been out with the hounds and caught a man . He told me he was killing more damned Yankees than Lee was killing at Richmond . That was all that was said . I did not make any reply . I did not say anything before he made that remark . I do not recollect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark . It was just a sudden outbreak on his part . TESTIMONY OF P. V. HALLEY . P. Vincent Halley testified : 1 I have been in the military service of the United States , in the 72d New York Volunteers . I was taken prisoner . I was at Andersonville . I arrived there the first or second of March , 1864 . I heard orders about putting prisoners in the stocks or the chain-gang . At one time when some prisoners who had escaped were taken to Captain Wirz 's headquarters ? I was there at the time ? he ordered the men to be taken to the forge and irons put on their feet . I heard Captain Wirz threaten to shoot a man . I think it was in May . Captain Wirz was in the stockade , and one of the men did not fall in quick enough , and Captain Wirz drew his revolver and threatened to shoot any man who ( lid not fall in when ordered ; sometimes he used his right hand .

TESTIMONY OF EDWARD S. KELLOGG . Edward S. Kellogg testified:1 I was in the military service of the United States . I was in the 20th New York Regiment . I was captured . I was taken to Belle Island . From thence I was taken to Andersonville . I arrived there the 1st of March , 1864 . I saw the cripple they called " Chickamauga " shot ; he was shot at the south gate.i He was in the habit of going off , I believe , to the outside of the gate to talk to the officers and the guard , and he wanted to go off this day for something or other . I believe that he was afraid of some of our own men . He went inside the dead-line and asked to be let out .

After Captain Wirz rode out of the gate the man went inside the dead-line , and Captain Wirz ordered the guard to shoot him , and he shot him . The man had lost his right leg , I believe , just above the knee . They called him " Chickamauga . " I think he belonged to the Western army and was captured at Chickamauga . I think that was in May . I will not be certain as to the time . I saw other men shot while I was there . I do not know their names . They were Federal prisoners . The first man I saw shot was shortly after the deadline was established . I think it was in May . Ile was shot near the brook , on // the east side of the stockade . At that time there was no railing ; there was simply posts stuck along where they were going to put the dead-line , and this man , in crossing , simply stepped inside one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to kill him , but wounded him . I do n't know his name . I saw a man shot at the brook ; he had just come in . IIe belonged to some regiment in Grant 's army . I think this was about the first of July or the latter part of June . He had just come in and knew nothing about the dead-line . There was no railing across the brook , and nothing to show that there was any such thing as a dead-line there . He came into the stockade , and after he had been shown his place where he was to sleep he went along to the brook to get some water . It was very dark , and a number of men were there , and he went above the rest so as to get better water . He went beyond the dead-line , and two men fired at him and both hit him . He was killed and fell right into the brook . I do not know the man 's name . I saw other men shot . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a common occurrence . I saw sanitary stores there . While I was in the hospital I saw some blankets and some pants and shirts ; I think very few . They were issued to the men in the hospital ? our own men . I saw them on other men than our own men . I saw a pair of pants on a rebel at one time ; his name was Dance . I was in the hospital . I went into the hospital August 6 , 1864 , and remained there until February 1 , 1865 . I was bucked six hours at one time while there . There was a man escaped from my ward . I was steward of the 17th ward , and I failed to report the man who escaped . Sergeant Smith came round and called me outside the gate and said that Captain Wirz had ordered him to buck me till dark . This was about nine o'clock in the morning . He proceeded to buck me , and I was left there till three o'clock in the afternoon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was William S. Wood , belonging to the 120th , and master of the ward . He was bucked by Captain Wirz 's order . When they bucked me they took a string and tied my wrists together in the first place ; they sat me down on the ground next , put my hands over my knees and put a stick over my arms and under my legs , my hands being tied together . I never saw a man bucked in our army , and I have been in the service four years . I have heard of it . I had no squad . I was steward of the 17th ward in the hospital . The time I was bucked one man got away . Several others got away afterwards . They failed to escape , and were brought back . I did not consider it my duty to report them , but it was the rule . I did not comply with the rule , and for non-compliance I was punished . There were very few in the hospital that were able to run away . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOSEPH R. ACHUFF . Joseph R. Achuff testified 1 . have been in the military service of the United States three years and nine months . I was a prisoner at Andersonville about six months . I was taken there on the 28th of March , 1864 , and kept there until about the middle of August , 1864 . I was taken from Andersonville to Charleston , South Carolina , in August , 1864 . I attempted to make my escape while at Andersonville . I // was recaptured by the hounds . Three of us got one rebel to take us out for wood . We gave him twelve brass buttons to take us out . When we got out about a quarter of a mile from the stockade I jumped on his back and the other boys took his gun from him , and off we went . We went to the Flint River , and crossed it five times , and then rowed down the river a piece . We did not know the hounds were after us until we heard them yell . Then we scattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I noticed there were five hounds upon me ; seven rebels , armed , came up on horseback . They were in sight at the time the hounds came on . They never took off the hounds for about fifteen minutes , and I had to fight the hounds with my fist . I had not even a club , or a chance of getting one . I had no clothes on but a pair of pants made out of two rebel meal sacks . I was bareheaded and barefooted . I fought the hounds with my fists about fifteen minutes . They tried to catch me by the throat , but I kept them off . They caught me by the legs , and I carry the marks there to-day . One of the men on horseback blew a horn , which called the hounds off , and I was marched back afoot . I was taken to Captain Wirz . He ordered me into the stocks . I was put into the stocks with my head fastened by a board , and my arms stretched out . They pretended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept in the broiling hot sun . For thirty-six hours I had nothing to eat , and but two drinks of water out of that dirty creek . When I appealed to Captain Wirz about it he told me to dry up , or he would blow my damned brains out , that I deserved to be bung . After I was taken out of the stocks , I was ironed . I had shackles fastened around each leg , an iron ring , and a bar of iron between my legs . This kept my legs separated about eighteen inches , so that I had to shuffle along . There was nothing done to cure my legs . Scurvy fell into the wounds , but still I was kept in irons . Parties going into the stockade with each other would become separated and lose sight of each other . We would go in there , and when the " nineties " would not be full the men would be scattered among them to fill up these " nineties . " That is the way we came not to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They would be carried off to the hospital or carried off somewhere else and we would never see them again . The stockade was the filthiest place that could be imagined . The filth was fully six inches deep . When I went in there it was in the night and was raining . The men were sitting around fires that were no bigger than a spittoon . Maybe there would be a dozen men crouching over such a fire . We thought they were all negroes . They were half naked , with no shelter and with nothing to eat . Some of the men were lying out doors and some were lying in shelter tents on the ground . If they had a blanket they were fortunate ; if not , they lay on the ground without any . The water that ran through that stockade a horse would not drink . It was the filthiest stuff , with grease upon it . I complained to Captain Wirz and asked him if he could not stop the grease from the cook-house from being allowed to flow in there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made that complaint about the latter part of June . I am not sure about the month . // TESTIMONY OF DANIEL W. BUSSINGER . Daniel W. Bussinger testified : 1 I have been in the military service of the United States . I was in the 10th Pennsylvania Reserves . I was captured on the 21st of May , 1864 , at Spottsylvania Courthouse . I was taken to Libby Prison , and from there to Andersonville , Georgia . I arrived at Andersonville on the 7th of June , 1864 . Captain Wirz was in command of the prison when I went there . The weather was very warm when I got there . We were counted off in front of Captain Wirz 's headquarters . It was very warm weather and we were forced to stand out for four hours while the sergeant called the roll and took our names . Some of the boys were sun-struck and fell down and we volunteered to carry them into the shade . Captain Wirz gave orders to the guards that if any man stepped out of the ranks he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in want of water , but they would not give us any . I asked some from one of the guards , and Captain Wirz gave orders to the guards that any man who asked for water would be shot . He said they were damned Yankees and did not need any water . When the men fell down and fainted , Captain Wirz said that if it lay in his power he would make the victory complete ; that the men who fell down there and fainted deserved to die there . I heard shots fired into the stockade very frequently . I have heard shots fired over the stockade by men outside of the guards , I suppose . They were not fired at any person , but were fired over the stockade . I never heard Captain Wirz give any orders as to firing into the stockade . I have seen men shot there . In the early part of July one man was shot down there at the run . That was the first case . In the middle of July a man was shot belonging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give his name . I saw him shot . He was shot at the run getting water . He was killed . Captain Wirz was not present . The man was not on the dead-line ; he was getting water . The water that came into the stockade was very greasy , and the man wanted to get the best water he could , and in doing so he approached too near to the dead-line and was shot . That was the first instance I saw . The man was carried to the south gate after he was shot . He remained there about two hours and was then carried off to the dead-house . The prisoner was at the stockade while the man lay there . I did not hear him say anything . I saw a man shot on the 18th of July , in the northeast part of the stockade . I do not know his name . He belonged to the 118th Pennsylvania . He was shot through the hip ; he was lying in his tent at night when he was shot . He was carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him lying there waiting for his turn to be carried out . He was not dead . I am not able to state whether he died or not . I did not see Captain Wirz there . I maw another man shot by the dead-line . I can not say at what time . The prisoner was not present . Captain Wirz was present when the first one was brought up to the south gate to be carried out . I did not hear him make any remarks . The men were very emaciated . I have seen them- searching for food that passed through men , not digested , down in the sink and in the marsh . I have seen them searching in the filth that was thrown away ; they would pick up // anything dropped from the wagon that brought the rations , bits of corn bread , or any scraps thrown from the raiders ' tents ; anything in the way to be eaten was picked up by such men . I have seen them eat this undigested food . They would wash it and eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men began to go away . There was one dead man who lay in the barracks about four days . He became putrid and was not carried out . Whose fault it was I do not know . He was buried there . Another man was buried there very near the raiders ' tent ; I saw his grave . I am not able to state why these men were buried inside the stockade . I suppose the one who died up at the barracks would have been carried out if the men had not gone away . That was the only way we could get wood , and when the men began to go out the wood became plenty . The man was not in a condition to be carried out when he was buried ; his body was decayed . I mean by the raiders ' tent , the tent of the desperadoes who infested the camp there , plundering their comrades of rations , or anything else they could find . They were some of the men who were afterwards hanged . There was an organized band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. TERRELL . Horatio B. Terrell testified : 1 1 was in the United States service ; in the 72d Ohio Infantry . I was taken prisoner on the 12th of June , 1864 , and was taken to Andersonville on the 19th of June , 1864 . I have often heard the prisoner use violent language to prisoners when they were being counted off . He said that if more than four damned Yankees got into a rank , he would make four out of them very quick . I remember that he came into the stockade one clay during the winter and one of the men showed him his rations of corn bread , and asked him politely if he could not give us a little more . Captain Wirz turned around , drew his pistol and said " God damn you , I will give you bullets for bread . " I do not recollect in what hand he held his pistol . I presume he held it in his right hand from the fact that if he used his left hand , I should have remembered it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days altogether when I was at Andersonville , not continuously . They were stopped about the 4th of July , I think for two days . A good many sick men were not able to go to the swamp , and had their comrades dig boles for them by the side of their tents . In this way a good deal of the ground along the edges of the tents were soon perforated with these holes . This made it unhealthy and spoiled the water to some extent which was in our wells . The whole ground in the swamp was perfectly poisonous from the filth and urine that had accumulated there , and any prisoner having the least scratch on his foot and going there , would get it poisoned , so that his foot would swell up and would gangrene in a short time . Frequently they lost their limbs and sometimes their lives . The dead-house was at the hospital during the first part of the time I was there . I carried out two men at different times and brought in wood on my re- // turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stockade , so that we only had to take the dead just outside the south gate , and that cut off the supply of wood . I counted forty-six corpses one day in the dead-house at the hospital . After they moved the dead-house nearer the stockade I saw what I should judge to be from seventy-five to one hundred dead men lying there in the sun . I have seen them carried away in wagons . We could see them plainly from the interior of the stockade when they took them away . About every day they would take them away . One man would go to the heels of a corpse and the other to the head , and they would swing him into the wagon . They would pile them in just like dead hogs from the slaughterhouses . I suppose there were eighteen or twenty to a load . I never saw any articles of value taken from the prisoners at Andersonville . I know of money being taken by the guards for permitting prisoners to go out . There was money taken about the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed upon . The rebel sergeants came in , and Selman , the rebel sutler , and Mr. Barr , the rebel quartermaster , and they told the boys that if they would give so much money , they should be the first to go out , and those who gave money were the first men who were taken out for exchange . Some that I know of paid twenty dollars and some paid less . These persons were under Captain Wirz 's command . They were in every day to call the roll . These propositions were tolerably open . They did not stand up and proclaim it , but they went to a good many who they supposed had money and told them of it . I know of men who gave money , and I know of men who gave a lot of brass buttons to get out . I do not know of the prisoner having received any for that purpose . TESTIMONY OF FRANK MADDOX . Frank Maddox testified : 1 I belong to the 35th United States ( negro regiment ) . I was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there about eleven months . I was taken there April 1 , 1864 . I left there February 2 , 1865 . When I was taken there I was put in the stockade and stayed there about two months , until my wounds got well enough to allow me to work . I was then taken out and put to work . I was wounded in the hip and foot . I was wounded at Olustee , Florida . When they took us out of the stockade , they put us to work , pulling up stoops around the stockade , cutting wood , and doing first one thing and then another . We were in and out until the 2d or 3d of September . We were then taken out and put to burying the dead . I did not assist in building the fortifications . We helped to enlarge the stockade . We commenced on that , I think , the 1st of June . I know Captain Wirz . I heard Captain Wirz make threats as to what he would do with us . One morning , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swamp t , ditch . It was very cold , and the boys did not want to go . Captain Wirz told the sergeant in charge , if we did not go , to take a club , and kill the last " damned one of us , and let the buzzards eat us . " I am speaking of the colored meJn1 My wounds hurt me while T was at work ; they had not healed up . I did not complain . I saw no use in complaining . Those who did complain did not get // anything done for them . I heard men complain to Captain Wirz about their sufferings from cold . When I was there in April it was very cold and we had no wood and nothing to lie upon , except the ground . One morning the sergeant asked him to let us out and get some wood . He said he was not going to do it ; that he did not care a damn if we all died . The sergeant intimated to its that Captain Wirz gave the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yankee . He would never treat us boys as Captain Wirz wanted him to trea us . He wanted him to be whipping us and knocking us about , and he did not do it . Captain Wirz ordered him to do it . I have seen him many times when he gave the orders . I looked right at him when the words came out of his mouth . 1 never saw colored men put in the stocks or the chain-gang . When they wanted to punish them , they put them across a log and whipped them half to death and put them back to work . . . . Captain Wirz never inflicted any punishment of any kind on me but he did on others . One he had whipped . I was up at his office in the morning to get an order for rations for the boys who would be out at work . He thought I was the man and commenced to curse me . The sergeant told him I was not the man , and called up Isaac Hawkins and asked him what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wirz hauled back and knocked him to the side of the tent , and told Turner to take him , strip him , and give him five hundred lashes , calling him " a daunted Yankee son of a bitch . " They gave him two hundred and fifty lashes , and the sergeant who was boss over us , and counted them , told Turner that he had given him five hundred , when he had only given him two hundred and fifty . The man was then loosed , and taken to the blacksmith shop , and had about two feet of chain put on him , and was sent to the graveyard to work , being told that if he stopped five minutes during the day , he would get two hundred and fifty more . The man was whipped on the bare back . He was stripped naked and put across a log , and they whipped him from his feet up to his head , across his back . They whipped him all over . He was whipped with a leather strap about as wide as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long . I know of a white man coloring himself and trying to escape . The man came out in the morning when we did . He had blackened himself and intended to get out to work where we were , so that he could get a chance to get away . They found him out , and Captain Wirz told the sergeant to take him , strip him , and give him thirty-nine lashes on his naked back , and he did so . He then ordered the man to be put in the stocks . Captain Wirz said the man had blacked himself to be a nigger , and , God damn him , he would give him a nigger 's law . That was thirty-nine lashes . Ile was whipped , but I do n't know whether they put him in tht stocks or not . I went off to work . I saw twelve men in the chain-gang for about a week . They had iron collars on their necks , and the chain connecting them all together , a ball and chain on their feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // TESTIMONY OF JOSEPH ADLER . Joseph Adler testified : 1 I was in the military service of the United States two years and nine months ; I was a prisoner at Andersonville ; I was there from about the middle of March to the 8th of September , 1864 ; I know Captain Wirz ; when I was captured there were seventy-one of us , including a young negro boy ; all that is left is about a dozen out of the seventy-one . I was part of the time in the hospital in the capacity of nurse ; I can not state exactly how long ; I think it was two or three months ; I went into the hospital in the month of June , and came out of there about three or four weeks before we left Andersonville ; I left Andersonville on the 8th of September ; while there I had opportunities of observing , from time to time , what was going on outside the stockade ; I should judge the sick were treated pretty badly ; the majority of the sick men had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no blankets ; they had nothing to lie on and nothing to cover themselves with ; they had hardly any clothing to cover their bodies with , and most of the time the food furnished them was unfit for them to eat , and consequently they had to go without anything to eat . It rained twenty-four days in June , if I am not mistaken ; I know it rained twenty days in succession ; at that time there were about 200 men lying out under the open sky without any shelter whatever , without any bedding or blankets , and some of them had nothing on but a shirt and a pair of drawers , and there was no medicine at the time to be given them , and they had no attendance whatever ; they had only a little water , and all they had to eat was a little corn-bread and rice soup , that I would not give to a dog . I do not recollect ever seeing Captain Wirz strike or kick any of the sick or anything of that kind ; I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost a friend while I was attending the hospital there . I made a request of Captain Wirz on that occasion . There was a man by the name of Stevenson , who belonged to the 2d Massachusetts Cavalry , Company A , the same company that I belonged to . He died there . He had respectable clothes on , and seeing that he was a friend of mine whom I had known for a long time , I did not , as I usually did , take off his clothes and give them to the living , but I left them all on his body , and requested Captain Wirz to let the clothes remain on the body , and he told me he would ; after the body was carried out of the hospital , Captain Wirz went with the wagon , and two Confederate soldiers took the clothes off the man and they buried him stark naked , without anything , not even a shirt on his body , Captain Wirz did not make use of any expressions at that time , that I can recollect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the condition of the rations and other things . Before T was detailed to go into the hospital , I went to see a friend of mine who was in another part of the stockade . IIe was almost dead with di ; u ? rhma , in fact so weak that he could hardly get up alone . He had very little clothes on , only a shirt and a pair of drawers , and he had to lie on the ground with his drawers down . He was not able to go to the place where we went to do our business . I and seven other persons had dug a tunnel in // rder to make our escape if we could . There was another man , a Union prisner , who had found out that we had dug the tunnel and were ready to start that veiling ; he went to Captain Wirz and told Wirz if he would give him someing to eat he would tell him some good news . The captain said he would , nd then he told the captain . The captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunnel . After the tunnel was filled up he went out of the Cockade and came right back again on a gray horse . He had a loaf of corn read in his hand , and as he went past the sick man that I was with the sick Ian saw him and got up as well as he could and said , " Captain , please give me ) mething to eat , a piece of that bread ; I am hungry ; I have had nothing to eat or two days ; I was too sick to go and get my rations , and there was no one to et them for me . " The captain had a little riding whip in his hand , but the nd of it was rather thick , and he turned round and struck the man over the ead with it . The man fell right on the ground and swooned away , and it was n hour before he came to himself again . The next day he was carried to the ospital , and two days after I heard he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital , I tried to find him out but could not . I was told he ras dead .

The order was to leave him in till Captain Wirz ordered im taken out . The captain was nowhere to be found , and the guards did not are to take him out , and he lay five or six hours in the stocks senseless until girz came and they took him out . He was in there for trying to make his scape . I heard Captain Wirz give orders to the guards in regard to the dead-line. ) ne day I went down to the brook to wash myself all over .

The sentry put up his musket , aimed at tie nan , and shot him right in the right breast . The man fell into the water , and ve dragged him out and took him up to his quarters . That was some time in he month of July , 1864 . I do n't know what day . I am certain I recognized ; aptain Wirz by the sentry . I heard his voice ; I do not know what the result f the wound was .

Captain Wirz would not let him , so he went inside the dead-line and some of us tried to get him out of . it by speaking to him , but he would not come and we dared not go inside because we were afraid we would be shot too .

I can not state exactly what , time it was because sometimes we would not know one date from another there.l TESTIMONY OF W. H. JENNINGS .

I saw the prisoner standing near him . I should consider from the motion that he had struck the man , and the man was recovering from the effects of the blow . Captain Wirz was still cursing him , telling him that , if he did not stand up , and stand still , he would shoot him . At that time , or soon after , another man had fallen out of the ranks , being unable to stand from the effects of the heat , and Captain Wirz ordered him to get up and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly , and Captain Wirz ordered one of the guards to shoot him . The guard raised his musket , but the man got back in the ranks . When he threatened to shoot his man if he did not stand up in the ranks , he drew his revolver . I am certain that he used his right hand , because if he had used his left I should have noticed it . It was during the fore part of August that I saw those men in the chain-gang . I do n't think I saw them after the tenth . I saw the chain-gang also in July , after the tenth . Sometimes they were the same men , but in different numbers . I saw them nearly every day from some time about the 10th of July to the 10th of August . They were near the southwest corner of the stockade , outside , not near the hospital , ? between the hospital and Captain Wirz 's headquarters . I have not heard the description of other witnesses as to where they were . I have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by other witnesses . I have noticed changes in the chain-gang ; a difference in the number . I have seen as many as twelve , perhaps more . I can not tell what day it was that I saw twelve . TESTIMONY OF ALEXANDER KENNEL . Alexander Kennel testified : l I was in the military service of the United States from September 26 , 1862 , till June 24 , 1865 , in the 7th Ohio Cavalry . I was a prisoner at Andersonville from February 27 , 1864 , till September 7 , 1864 , and from December 25 , 1864 , till April 19 , 1865 . I know the prisoner , Captain Wirz . I have seen men who were balled and chained , and also men who were bucked and gagged by his orders ; I have seen them put in the stocks . One special act which I know of occurred last February . In that case a man was taken out of the stockade in the evening about 4 o'clock , and kept in the stocks all night . He was turned into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he died in less than eight hours . He died in the stockade . Ile was apparently as healthy as any of the prisoners in the stockade . Ile was kept all night in the stocks , which were outside the stockade . It was supposed that he died from the effects of the stocks . It was a very cold night . // I talked with him an hour before he died . He was impressed with the belief that he was chilled to death that night in the stocks . He did not expect to live , from his conversation . He did not eat anything after he came into the stockade . He told me that he was kept in the stocks from the time he was taken out until about eight o'clock in the morning . He was chilled so thoroughly that he was insensible . I helped to carry him to the gate after he died . I did not know his name ; I never inquired it . He belonged to a Pennsylvania regiment . I am certain that it occurred about the 15th of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation with a man in the hospital who had been taken out of the chain-gang , and I saw his body carried to the dead-house three days after I had the conversation with him . He told me in that conversation that he had not been able to walk since he had been taken out of the chain-gang . He died in the hospital . That was in August , 1864 . I can not tell how long after he had been taken from the chain-gang that he died . It was about the 13th of August when I had this conversation . The man was very much emaciated , and was sore in the ankles where the ball had been put on . There were no other marks on his person , that I saw . I can speak of no other instances , except of men whom I have seen confined in the stocks for some time . TESTIMONY OF L. S. POND . L. S. Pond testified : 1 I was in the military service of the United States ; in the 2d New York Heavy Artillery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about four months ? from the 28th of June , 1864 . I saw the prisoner commit acts of cruelty towards sick men . He came into the stockade one day , I think it was in the month of August ( I had a memorandum of every circumstance that happened , but I lost it ; I never tried to commit them to memory ) . The men were ordered to fall into ranks to be counted off . We were playing what we used to call " roots " with them . That is , we used to go into three or four different squads if we could , so as to get an extra ration . There was a very sick man there who could not stand upon his limbs , and Captain Wirz ordered him to fall in to be counted off . The man could not fall in , and he told him so . Captain Wirz kicked him three or four times , and said : " I will learn tt damned Yankee who tries to play roots ' upon me . " TESTIMONY OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the military service of the United States . I was in the 14th Connecticut when I was taken prisoner . I was taken to Andersonville . I was there from the 23d of May , 1864 , to the end of September , 1864 . I know Captain Wirz . On the 7th of September , 1864 , I saw him knock a man down with a revolver . I do not recollect in which hand he held the revolver . The soldier was taken back inside the stockade , and I never saw him since . It was the day the prisoners were taken to Savannah . I belonged to the eighty-ninth detachment , and tried to get out with some of the first ones , and went outside for // that purpose . I " flanked " out . There I heard this remark from Captain Wirz , that the first flanker he would catch he would shoot him . A flanker means a man going into a wrong detachment . This soldier who was knocked down with a pistol was out there with a detachment to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was left out , his name not being on the roll . Captain Wirz knocked him down and told him he was a flanker , and he was sent back to the stockade . Complaints were made about our rations and treatment . I have signed one letter myself , and sent it , stating that we suffered a great deal . It was dropped in the letter-box . There was no notice taken of it . We never received any answer . I never heard Captain Wirz make use of any language with reference to it . I never spoke to him myself . I saw prisoners who were shot by sentries . I have seen a man shot going for water , leaning over the dead-line . I have seen the sentries fire , and I afterwards saw the man carried from the place wounded . I have heard sentries say that they got thirty days ' furlough for shooting prisoners . My tent was right close by the dead-line , and I asked the sentry once if it were so , that they got furlough for shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' furlough . Almost every time a man was shot the sentry was relieved and taken from his post . The corporal of the guard would come up and inquire what the firing was about , and would bring another man and would relieve the sentinel . I saw Captain Wirz at sick-call . I have seen him standing once at the gate when the sick men were crowding and pushing at the dead-line . Captain Wirz said to one of the guards , " Give them the bayonet , the damned Yankees . " The sentinel did not charge bayonet on them . At that time I saw a sentry shoot one of the sick men at the gate . It was in August , 1864 ; I can not state the date . The sick men behind were pushing the men in front , and some of them got over the dead-line . The sentinel stepped back one step and aimed . One man thought the sentinel aimed at him , and he took the gun to prevent him shooting him ; at the same time the sentry fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time hit another man in the hip . I did not see Captain Wirz there . No warning was given to prisoners about the dead-line . On the 23d of May we were drawn up in line in front of Captain Wirz 's office , and had to wait there for about three hours in the sun until he came to count us off . All that time the rebel soldiers would not dare to give us water . We asked for water , and they said they had orders not to give us any . Captain Wirz came and made us fall in and counted us off in detachments . I never was told about the dead-line , and when I saw it I thought it must be just a pleasure walk for the prisoners to exercise in . I was not there half an hour before I was told what it meant . TESTIMONY OF WILLIAM CROUSE . William Crouse testified : ) I have been in the military service of the United States ; in the 7th Pennsylvania Reserves . I was taken prisoner on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lynchburg , where I stayed two weeks , and from Lynchburg to Andersonville , where I arrived on the 20th of May , 1864 . I stayed there till the 15th of September , 1864. footnote ' Record , p. 217. // I knew the prisoner there . I saw him knock a man down . 1 can not tell the man 's name . That was in July , 1864 . Captain Wirz knocked him clown , that is all . I did not hear him say anything . He just knocked him right down . That man was a Union prisoner . That is all I know about it . I saw men in the stocks . I saw them in July and August , 1864 . I saw a man die the day after he came out of the stocks . I do not know his name . It was about July , 1864 . I should judge he had been in the stocks about two weeks . I saw him die . He died in the next tent to me . I do not know of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix the date of that man dying , who had been in the stocks . I remember seeing six men hung there . They were hung on the 13th of July , 1864 . It was two or three days before that . TESTIMONY OF JAMES E. MARSHALL . James E. Marshall testified : 1 I have been in the military service of the United States , in the 42d New York . I was a prisoner at Andersonville from the latter end of February , 1864 , up to September , 1864 . I often saw Captain Wirz while I was there . I suppose I know him . I know of prisoners being shot by the guards . The first instance I saw was at the northeast corner against the hospital . It was at the time the dead-line was being marked out , but it was not then finished . I saw a man shot there . It was in the early part of April . I saw the man shot by the sentry . The mark of the dead-line was there , but the rail was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything at the time . The man died afterwards in the hospital . He was a sick man in the hospital then . He was not a German . I recollect an instance where a German was killed . He passed me , and when he had got about five yards from me he was shot by the sentry . That was at the northeast part of the stockade , in the month of May , 1864 , I believe . The man had laid his left hand on the dead-line , and stooped on his knee to pick up a piece of mouldy bread that was within the dead-line , when the guard shot him.The ball passed through his back . It killed him dead . The sentry said something about a furlough . hen the man fell he was not outside of the dead-line , and some of us made the remark in the camp that that guard would get a furlough for shooting the man . The sentry said he would damned soon have another one ; that he would shoot some more . Captain Wirz came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the firing of the gun he would often come up . He told the sentry to make the prisoners go away from there ; they had gathered around the man after he was shot . The sentry was relieved . When Captain Wirz first came to take charge of the camp he was forming the men into detachments , and they did not fall into ranks properly according to his wishes . He stopped the rations that day . They had not had rations since the day previous . That was in the early part of April , when Captain Wirz first came to the camp ; the first time I saw him . I saw the dogs at Andersonville . They were kept for hunting men who escaped from the prison . I know of their hunting men . T saw one man who was torn . footnote i Record , p. 252. // His leg was torn . He afterwards died in the hospital . That was in May , 1864 . I can not state the day of the month . It was some time in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bitten by the dogs , because I and several others looked at his leg . IIe was taken to the hospital . I afterwards saw the man , but he was dead when I saw him . He died from the wounds . He died some twenty days after he was bitten . He died some time in the early part of June , in the hospital . TESTIMONY OF W. M. PEEBLES . William M. Peebles , a rebel soldier at Andersonville , detailed as a clerk : Some of his testimony has already been quoted . Ike testified further I saw several men in the stocks . I did not learn their names . They were Federal prisoners . I was passing around one day during a hard rain , and I saw a prisoner in the stocks . He seemed to be near drowning . I rode up and put an umbrella over him . I passed up to Captain Wirz 's headquarters and told him that the prisoner was there and might drown . He remarked , " Let him drown , " using an oath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were " Let the damned Yankee drown ; I do n't care . " In a few minutes some one from his headquarters went down and released the prisoner ? took him out from the stocks . It was during a very hard rain . The man 's head was kind of erect , and it was raining down in his face . He looked as though he would drown . That was what caused me to make the report . TESTIMONY OF W. W. CRAND ALL . W. W. Crandall , private in the 4th Iowa Infantry , testified : 2 I saw hounds used about there . They were not what I would call fox-hounds ; they were rather heavier , I should think , but I am not well posted enough in dogology to tell you what kind of dogs they were . They were called hounds ; there were two kinds , however . I saw there three different packs . One or two in each pack , l think , they were more of a bulldog . They called them catch-dogs . I have seen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Some of the men were bitten considerably . I saw one man with the calves of his legs torn badly . He was a Union prisoner . I can not now recollect his name . He belonged to the same detachment as I , but not to my ninety . He was brought in there and a hall and chain put upon each foot . He was kept in that condition several weeks . He was kept there until I went to Captain Wirz and pleaded with him to take the balls off . He said to me that he could not do it . I then watched for the surgeons , and when one of them came in one morning to examine the sick I asked him to take the balls off . He went with me and examined the man . The man 's leg had become badly swollen and very blue . It had a bluish putrified look . I told the surgeon that I thought the man would die unless the balls were taken off . He said he could not conscientiously take off but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The man finally died , as I supposed . I buried a man whom I thought I recognized as the same man , but he was so badly emaciated that I might be mistaken , but I think I was not . The man escaped , I think , about the 1st of // May . He was brought back the next day , I think ; it may have been the next day but one . Those balls and chains were put on at once and kept on him for perhaps three weeks , then they took one ball off . He retained the other when I was taken outside , on the 23d of June . Then about the middle of July ( it might have been the last of July ; 1 can not fix the date , but it was some time from the middle to the last of July , ) I buried a man whom I recognized , or thought I recognized , as the same man . I examined the body particularly because several of us were acquainted with him , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead at Andersonville . I assisted in burying the dead from June 23 , 1864 , until September 8th . I was detailed for that duty . It would be pretty hard to tell the number of prisoners that I buried who had been shot , because it became so common a thing that we did not fix the number . I should say at least thirty , possibly forty , and it may be more . I can not tell the exact number . I am speaking of the period from June 23d to September 8th . The bodies would be brought in and the remark would be made , " Here is another man shot . " It became so common an occurrence that I did not take any notice , so that I can not speak as to the number . I would see , during those months , all that were shot , that were buried . I might not hear of them . The duty I was doing was covering up the dead . I became so accustomed that I paid little attention , and unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not see them . I know of a man being put in the stocks for asking to see his brother . His name was Austin ; he was paroled in the same squad I was . I was on the banks of the railroad when a lot of prisoners came in . This man Austin made the remark , " There is a brother of mine ; I am going to see him . " He went down to the squad , and I saw him a short time afterwards in what we call the " spreadeagle stocks . " He was there from two to four hours . That was in the latter part of July . I asked another man who was there what it was for , and was told it was for asking to see his brother . The man had told me that was what he was going for . I do not know who ordered the man to the stocks , no further than what I have stated . The stocks in which that man was placed were just above the south gate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were two kinds of stocks there , but they were both near together . There were what we called the foot stocks , and also , as the boys termed them , the " spread-eagle " stocks , which held a man by his ankles , his neck , and his hands . TESTIMONY OF JOHN FISHER . John Fisher ( colored ) testified:I I am a soldier in the United States army . I am in the 8th United States Regiment . I was a prisoner at Andersonville . I was taken on the 20th of February , 1864 , and taken there in May , 1864 . I received very bad treatment there . I was bucked and gagged , and whipped with thirty-nine lashes . I was bucked because I would not go to work . Captain Wirz ordered me to be whipped ; so the man said who was in charge of the squad . He went to see Captain Wirz , and when he came back he said Captain Wirz ordered me to be whipped . IIe gave me thirtynine lashes . This was in October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time . That was the only time . I have seen the prisoner there many a time . 1 // saw him draw a pistol to shoot a prisoner named George Brown . He was going after some shovels , and could not run as fast as Captain Wirz wanted him . Captain Wirz drew his pistol and said if he did not run he would shoot him . I saw no others whipped there . I saw others after being whipped . They were Isaac Hawkins , Abe Woodward , and George Washington . That was in September . Two of them were whipped at the graveyard . I was not present when they were ordered to be whipped . I did not see them while they were being whipped . I just saw them after they were whipped . They had marks upon them of the strap with which they had been whipped . They were not badly whipped ; the blood was not drawn . TESTIMONY OF J. II . GOLDSMITH . John H. Goldsmith testified : 1 1 have been in the military service of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was taken prisoner on the 4th of October , 1864 , at Atwood , Georgia ; I arrived at Andersonville on the 11th day of October , and remained there until the 18th day of March , 1865 . Captain Wirz was in command of the prison all the time I was there . On or about the 1st of March , 1865 , Captain Wirz put me in charge of the rations to be issued to the prisoners inside of the stockade , and to the paroled men outside . I had charge of the rations up to the time I left the prison . The rations consisted of half a pound of meal of very poor quality , half a pound of beef , half a pound of peas and two gills of molasses . The ration of molasses was on each alternate clay , and of beef the same day . When they took the beef and molasses together , there was one quarter of a pound of beef and one gill of molasses . The beef was very poor ; some called it " jackass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once or twice a week . It was poor meal , with cob and grain all ground together . The sample of meal produced by De la Baume was here shown the witness . That is just the quality of meal , as a general thing . Captain Wirz used to give me the orders always for drawing rations , when I had charge of the rations . He used to make out tickets for me to draw from Captain Armstrong . I drew what he made out the tickets for . The ticket specified the articles and the quantity ? it limited the rations . The rations issued to our prisoners was just one-half the quantity issued to the rebel troops . There were three days there that he increased the rations of meal and of peas to one-fourth pound per day . At the end of three days he put the ration back to the old standard again . He said the Yankees were getting too damned saucy , and that he would bring them to their milk . I was out on parole most of the winter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I left . My duties outside the stockade were writing for Captain Wirz . Part of the time I attended to the death list , making out the records of the prisoners . I had no particular duties assigned to me , but to assist in writing . The death list was the list of those who died each day in prison . I was engaged in that duty every morning . I recorded the names of those who were shot . I did not keep the causes of death there , but merely stated the day they died , without stating the disease . I have had to write out orders for Captain Wirz to punish men ? orders to the guard to fire upon them in case any of them attempted to speak to the guard . // There were orders issued for the discipline of the prison , warning men not to attempt to speak to the guard , as they had got orders to fire upon them if they did so . I have heard verbal orders given to rebel sergeants to punish those who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any man that was missing . They were to be punished by being placed in the stocks or by being eked and gagged . I have heard Captain Wirz say he was doing more good there than if he were .. ifr  --  the field , and that he could whip more men than Johnston 's army could . He did not make that statement more than once that I recollect . That was made about the latter part of January , 1865 . I can not recollect his saying " killing " ; he said he could whip more men . I have seen orders signed by the prisoner in relation to furloughs . I made out a furlough once for a man who killed one of our own men ; he received a furlough for thirty days . His name was Scott ; he belonged to the 4th Georgia Reserves . The man he killed was Henry Lochmire , belonging to some Pennsylvania regiment , I can not recollect what regiment . It was in the latter part of February , 1865 . TESTIMONY OF JASPER CULVER . Jasper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wisconsin Infantry . I was captured at Chickamauga and taken to Richmond and Danville , and afterwards to Andersonville . I arrived at Andersonville on the 16th of March , 1864 . I know the prisoner . I saw him frequently . When I first arrived at the prison it was in charge of a man named Selman . At least I saw him counting off squads and seeming to have a great deal to do there . Soon after I went there Captain Wirz came there and took charge . I first saw him come into the stockade with Selman in the evening . Selman gave his orders to the men to fall in the next morning in four ranks . Next morning they beat roll-call and we fell in as he directed . Captain Wirz came and counted us off in detachments of 270 men , and divided these into nineties , appointing a sergeant over each ninety . He then gave his orders not to break ranks , to remain in ranks until he got through counting the prisoners . We did not stay in ranks , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through . I was down towards the gate afterwards , about noon , and heard Captain Wirz going about using rough language . He said we should not receive any rations , and he would learn us to stand in ranks as we were ordered , and we did not receive rations that day . That was the first day that he took command . I saw him shortly afterwards when he was counting off . I was standing near by and happened to be looking towards him . A man seemed to be walking past him , and Captain Wirz turned around and struck him three or four times and knocked the man down . I saw the man afterwards . He seemed to be quite sickly and delicate . He could hardly walk . Some time after that rations were stopped from the northern side of the stockade . That was some time in April , 1864 , I think . Next day he came over and said he would give us rations , ( I was on the south side , ) but that the fellows on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do as he had ordered them to do . He said that they had broken ranks , and he would not give them any rations ; and he did not . // I was not kept in the stockade all the time I was there . I was put on duty in the bakery on the 29th of June , 1864 . That was the bakery on the stream just above the stockade . My duties there were to unload the meal that came there and carry it into the bakery , and also to load the bread into the wagons for the stockade . The meal was generally very coarse , as if it was ground cobs and all . Other sacks seemed to be very good meal . A great many sacks came there in which the meal was mouldy and wet , as if it had been stored in a damp place . Some of it would come in large mouldy chunks of meal . Sometimes it could not be used at all . It was not used . It was just thrown out by those who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ De la 13aume was here shown to the witness . That is a fair sample of a large portion . There were sometimes some sacks better than that , but very seldom . It was generally of that quality . I have sometimes noticed sacks coarser than that . I used to help in loading the bread into the wagons . The bread was baked in cakes about eighteen inches long , ten inches wide and two inches thick , made of this meal . Ten of those loaves or " cards " were sent out to a detachment of two hundred and seventy men for one day . There was some baked in larger pans , about two and a half feet long . fifteen inches wide and two inches thick , made of this meal . There were four or four and a half of them sent to each 270 men . They were generally very poorly baked . The center of them was almost always raw . They never could be baked properly . Those large " cards " that were baked in the night and sent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became stringy from the sour dough and the heat of the bread , and it was impossible to eat it . I saw the chain-gang . When I first went outside of the stockade on the 29th of June , 1864 , I saw twelve men in the chain-gang chained together under guard . Next morning they came down to the bakery to wash . I gave them some water and pails to wash and also carried their rations to them from the bakery . I saw them almost every day for over a month or six weeks that they were together . They were placed in two files with a thirty-two pound ball chained to each outside leg of the file on the right side and on the left leg of the left file . Then they were chained with what seemed to be two 100-pound balls , at least they called them 100-pounders . There were three men of each file with chains attached to each one of these 100-pound balls . They had also a band of iron riveted around each man 's neck , and a chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were kept . I believe there were six men in each file . The file leaders were not attached to the other file . If one man moved the whole twelve had to move . One of the file leaders was very poorly and seemed as though he could hardly carry himself without carrying ball and chain ; those in the gang with him complained about his being sick . He caused a great deal of trouble by reason of his having diarrhrea , and they all had to go with him whenever he was called . I afterwards saw this sick man out of the chain-gang , but he had the ball upon his legs , also the band upon his neck . He afterwards died in the guard-house . I saw our men who were on parole take the irons off hint after he was dead . He was taken from the chain-gang , hut the 32-pound ball was left upon his leg and the band upon his neck , and they were left upon him until he died . I think he died three or four days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he died some time in // July . I do not know his name or his regiment . I never made inquiries about it . I think the same occurrence was testified to by one witness . I think I heard a different one testified to , although I do not recollect of any other occurrence of a man dying in the chain-gang but this one . I heard these men complain to us who had been out on parole that he was a great trouble to then . I have often seen men in those stocks that are spoken of . I have seen men in them very frequently . I never knew of men dying in the stocks . It was a common occurrence to see men standing in those stocks , and also men lying down in the stocks that were made to hold men in that way . They had to lie upon their backs with their feet about a foot from the ground ; they lay in that position all day in the sun . I know of one man in particular ; he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that drew rations into the stockade . He also used to help draw the dead with the same team . This man , for something or other , was put in there . I saw him lying on the ground all of one day in the sun . I can not think of his name , although I did know it . I do not recollect " Chickamauga 's " name . I recollect hearing them say he bebelonged to the 96th Tllinois . I was at my tent and saw a crowd around the gate . I walked down towards the gate and saw Captain Wirz on his gray horse inside the gate . I walked up towards the crowd . Just as I got there Captain Wirz came to the gate and I asked him what the trouble was , and he said that the boys were having some fun with " Chickamauga . " I turned around to go back towards my tent , when I heard the report of a gun and saw the guard just drawing back his musket and I saw the smoke of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead-line , and saw this cripple lying just inside the dead-line . He seemed as if he was not quite dead ; he was writhing in the agonies of death . I turned with some of the boys who took him up and were conveying him to the hospital . I walked along with them and looked at him . After I got some distance away , I looked around and saw Captain Wirz upon the sentry-box with the sentry . I did not hear anything said or any remarks made by him to the sentinel . I went off to my tent pretty thoroughly disgusted . I heard Captain Wirz make a remark with reference to what he was doing there . He was just inside the gate one day ; there was quite a crowd there talking . I heard one of the boys making the remark that he would rather be at the front with Sherman or Grant than to stay there . Captain Wirz made the remark that he was doing more for the Confederate government there than any general in the field , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was just inside the gate . TESTIMONY OF J. L. YOUNKER , John L. Younker testified : 1 I was in the military service of the United States , in the 12th United States Infantry . I enlisted March 31 , 1862 , for three years . I was a prisoner at Andersonville from June 16 , 1864 , to September 12 , 1864 . I know about the use of hounds there for pursuing and capturing prisoners . There was a man , I suppose about fifty years of age , who was in charge of twelve bloodhounds ; whenever he was on duty he always rode on a mule . He // generally went round the stockade every morning , and if he found the track of any prisoners he went in pursuit . There was one man , belonging to an Indiana regiment , who was taken sick and sent to the hospital . From the hospital he tried to make his escape ; he was recaptured by the bloodhounds and sent back to the stockade in the evening . He had an acquaintance in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost off ; he was bitten in several places in the legs . He was all scratched , and had hardly any clothing on . I took a piece of my old dirty shirt and helped to tie up his wounds . Then he gave up to a friend of his a likeness of his mother which he had , and said that he should send her this if he should never recover , because he believed he would die . The next morning he was dead . He gave this picture to one of my comrades . He was a resident of the northern part of Ohio , and he said that the man should deliver the picture to his mother , as he should never recover , that he should die . In that same conversation he said something as to how he had been injured . We questioned him , and he replied in a feeble voice that he had got about thirty-five or forty miles , and was strongly pursued by the hounds ; that , as he was very weak , coming out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but was pulled down by one of the dogs , and so disabled that he could proceed no further . We had to stir him up once in a while , give him a regular shake , so that he might answer a few more questions , because he was expiring . I saw him after he was dead . That was a few days before the six raiders were hung , which was on the 11th of July . That bloodhound affair struck my mind . Shortly afterward , I was taken out on detail into the graveyard , and I one day met the old bloodhound man , and I asked him , " Why in the world are you committing such cruelties against us Yankees ? " " Why , " said he , " it is the order of Captain Wirz . I would not do it , but he told me to fetch back one of you Yankee sons of  --  . " I was on duty as a grave-digger . The prisoners were buried in trenches 180 feet long , 7 feet wide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had from Captain Piggot , superintendent of the graveyard . They were laid side by side on their backs ; and we generally covered them with some pine slabs or puncheons as they were called , until these got so scarce that we could not get enough to cover the bodies , so we just put them in without anything covering them but the ground . The bodies when they came there for interment were about half mortified . We could hardly touch them to pull them out of the wagons onto the old stretcher without their skin remaining in our hands ; and they were full of vermin of all descriptions . Two teams , drawn by four mules each , were employed in bringing the dead to the graveyard . They were covered wagons like our army wagons . They were hauling steadily from morning till night almost . The dead were placed right on top of each other in the wagons . They had hardly any clothes on . The first act of cruelty which I saw committed by Captain Wirz was on the day of my arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his headquarters , which consisted of an old log cabin . He was most noted to me by the revolver which he carried in his belt , and the foreign accent with which he spoke the English language . I and about fifteen more were on the extreme left of the line . We were counted out , as I was told by the guard , to fill up old detachments , and the rest of the men were all counted in nineties . Captain Wirz fussed around there , threatening and cursing . I thought he was a pretty rough customer . After // the other men were all marched into the stockade we were marched in front of his headquarters and remained there . Captain Wirz and several other rebel officers went inside . One of the guards seemed to be a little friendly to me , and he told me the condition of the prisoners in the stockade ; that they had no shelter or anything . I had been robbed in Richmond of everything I had . I saw an old piece of tin under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profession , I thought I might make myself a pan out of that tin if I had it . I reached for it . At the same moment Captain Wirz came out . He commenced cursing and said to the guard , " Why do n't you shoot that Yankee son of ? . I will keep you in line . Damn you , I will put you in the stockade , and let you rot like a great many have done before . " So I did not get the tin . I went in without it . My rations were stopped . Whenever Captain Wirz wanted to find out something in regard to tunneling , or if a man was absent from roll-call ? some poor fellow who might have gone to the sink in the center of the stockade where the little brook was , and become unable to return ? our rations were stopped . On the 4th of July , 1864 , we did not get a bite . I have seen men in the stocks . The stocks were of various kinds . Some just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , so that the man could either sit or lie down , exposed to all kinds of weather . Others held a man round the neck with his arms stretched out . As a man stood there in that way it appeared to me ( I can find no other expression for it ) just like the image of Christ crucified . TESTIMONY OF WILLIAM BULL . William Bull testified : 1 I have been in the military service of the United States , in Company A , Means 's Independent Loudon Rangers , from the State of Virginia . They were loyal . I was a prisoner at Andersonville . I arrived there the 3d of June , 1864 . When I got there I was put in the stockade , where I remained eight months . I then got out on parole , and was out three months and twenty-three days . I left the stockade the 24th March , 1865 . I saw several men shot on the dead-line . For the whole eight months I was there , I think I saw in the neighborhood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the names of any of them . The first man I saw shot was the afternoon that I entered the stockade ? the third of June , 1864 , at the north gate . Captain Wirz came in at the head of the detachment . He put three guards on the stoop , and ordered them to fire at the crowd to make them keep back . As we came along in he kept telling them to keep back , and he told the guard to fire . At last one of the guards did fire and shot a man . The ball struck him in the stomach . The sentry was not fifteen feet from him when he fired . There were three sentries together ; only one sentry fired . The next man I saw shot was about two months after that . Ile was inside the stockade , at the stream which ran through it . I think the man had come in the same day . He went down to the brook to get water , stooped over to get a drink , and was killed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went in at the right ear and came out at the other side . I do not know that man 's name or regiment . I do not know by whose orders he was shot . // All the orders I ever heard given there were given by Captain Wirz . I heard none given at that time . There was no one on the post but the sentinel . The next man I saw shot was in September , 1864 . I was lying in the stockade about six feet from the dead-line , asleep . I lay right next him , within three or four feet of him . It was the habit at night to call out the hour . This guard was asleep , and when it came round to him to call the hour the guard below him kept hallooing to him to wake up . He woke up and fired right down into the camp , and shot a man through the knee . The man died two or three days afterwards . I do not know his name ; he belonged to an Illinois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of September . The next man I saw shot was about the 15th of July about three or four days after the execution of these men at the south gate . It was doctor 's call in the morning , and the crowd was rushing up . The orders from the doctor were to fire on the crowd if they did not keep back . This man was so sick that he fell over on the guard , who fired at him and shot him through the right shoulder . I do not think he died . I recollect one being shot back of the hospital , inside the ptockade . He was a crazy man . He was shot right through the head . He ran over the dead-line and asked the guard to shoot him . That was in January , 1865 , a few days before I came out on parole . He was killed instantly . I did not see Captain Wirz present at the time . I do not recollect , now , seeing any other men shot . On the 3d of June , 1864 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn up in a line . A young fellow named Doherty , belonging to my company , started after some water . Captain Wirz was counting at the head of the men , and the young fellow asked Sergeant Smith , who was standing right by , if he could go and get some water . Smith said he had no objection . Captain Wirz came along and asked where that damned Yankee was going . He caught hold of him , kicked him three or four times , and put him back in the ranks . I do not know any other incident of that character . TESTIMONY OF J. H. BURNS . Jas . H. Burns testified : 1 I was in the military service of the United States , in the 10th Connecticut , Company I. I was a prisoner at Andersonville for nearly eight months , from February 23 , 1864 , to the 7th of September . I saw Captain Wirz while I was there . I have known him ill treat prisoners in his custody . I saw him order the guard to shoot a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was put in the stocks once myself , under his orders , for trying to make my escape . I heard him order the guard to put me there . I was kept there twentyfour hours or thereabouts , with nothing to eat or drink . That was either on the 13th or 14th of July , 1864 . I saw Captain Wirz come in there one morning to call the roll ? one morning in July , 1864 . He came in and knocked some of my comrades around , and used harsh language to them . He drew his revolver upon me one morning , but he did not use it . I. have known him fire into a crowd of prisoners . One morning a stone or brick was thrown at him as he came into the camp , riding on his horse . He // immediately drew his revolver and fired into the crowd of prisoners in the stockade . I never heard any complaints made to him to my knowledge . I remember no instance of death resulting from shooting or otherwise by Captain Wirz . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suffered down there . He stopped the men 's rations once on the 3d or 4th of July ; at least it was said that it was he who stopped them . Next day the meat was brought in in a condition not to be used . That was said to be under his orders . I was in prison at the time a shot was fired over it . There was a solid shot fired over the camp one day . The prisoners had rushed down near the gateway to see some new prisoners who were coming in . There was a solid shot fired over the camp , going toward the northwest corner of the camp . I do not know the date , but I should judge it was in July , 1864 . The guns pointed toward the stockade . All the artillery that we could see was turned toward the camp . I saw eight pieces to my knowledge bearing on the camp . I saw them in that position for three months . I heard Captain Wirz tell the guard , " Shoot the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the kind . The more we shoot the less we will have to feed or fight . " That was one morning that I was going after wood . It was in the month of June . TESTIMONY OF A. G. BLAIR . A. G. Blair testified 1 was in the military service of the United States , in the 122d New York . I was taken prisoner on the 23d of May , 1864 , at the battle of the Wilderness . I was taken to Libby Prison first , and from that to Andersonville , where I arrived about the first of June . Captain Wirz was in command of the prison when I arrived there . I have heard a great many questions asked Captain Wirz about rations whenever he would come into the camp , His reply was generally an oath , saying that we would get all the rations we deserved , and that was damned little . Q. Did he ever say he would not give you rations if he could ? A. I never heard him make that exact remark . Q. Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fore part of my imprisonment there we had no rations . The report came from good authority that he was the cause of it , be being in charge of the camp . Interrupted by counsel for the accused . Question repeated . A. I have not heard those words from his mouth . Q. Did you hear any similar language used by Captain Wirz to that which I repeated to you ? If so , state what the language was . Objected to by counsel for the accused on the ground that witness had already answered in the negative . After deliberation the objection was overruled . A. On one occasion when he was asked by several of the prisoners who had not had any rations for twenty-four hours , when they were to have any , he made the // remark that if the rations were in his hands we would not get any . That was in the beginning of July , 1864 , just before or after the 4th . I have seen him stand at the gate when sick men were carried out . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the shade , and they would rush out to a small passage-way made in the large doors coining out , to suit him . I have seen him shove the well , and the sick who were being carried , over on their backs ; or sometimes he would order the guards to do it . The condition of the men taken out of camp into the hospital was hopeless ? all that I ever saw taken out . I escaped from Andersonville in. the latter part of July or the fore part of August , and got about thirty miles from the stockade when I was captured and brought back to the camp . I was kept over night , and then was put in the stocks . The first day that I was taken out of the stocks I was not put in the stockade that night . I was put in the stocks the next day , and then was returned to the prison with three other comrades . I do not recollect the exact number of hours I was kept in the stocks ; I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give any orders in reference to your being put in the stocks ? A. Just before I was put in the stocks I saw him give some orders from his headquarters , and I supposed that those were the orders . I saw prisoners shot on or near the dead-line , on several occasions . I was down , in the fore part of my imprisonment , to get water at the creek . That was the only resource for obtaining water , except you had a right in one of the wells . The crowd was very great there . It was absolutely necessary sometimes either to get over the dead-line or to thirst . I have seen men on five or six occasions either shot dead or mortally wounded for trying to get water under the deadline . I have seen one or two instances where men were shot over the dead-line . Whether they went over it intentionally , or unconsciously from not knowing the rules , I can not say . I think that the number of men shot during my imprisonment ranged from twenty-five to forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their names . I did know them at the time , because they had tented right around me , or messed with me , but their names have slipped my mind . Two of them belonged to the 40th New York Regiment . Those two men were shot just after I got there , in the latter part of June , 1864 . Q. Did you see the person who shot them ? A. I saw the sentry raise his gun . I hallooed to the man . I and several of the rest gave the alarm , but it was too late . Both of these men did not die ; one was shot through the arm ; the other died ; he was shot in the right breast . I did not see Captain Wirz present at the time . I did not bear any orders given to the sentinels , or any words from the sentinels when they fired ; nothing more than they often said that it was done by orders from the commandant of the camp , and that they were to receive so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those twenty-five or forty men were shot from the middle of June , 1864 , until the 1st of September . There were men shot every month . I can not say that I ever saw Captain Wirz present when any of these men were shot . I had no chance of seeing him unless he was in the stockade . The majority of those whom I saw shot were killed outright ; expired in a few moments . Q. Can you give a detailed description of those you saw killed and of the dates ? A. In regard to the dates I can not give you any detail . I lost dates there , and // did not know when Sunday came . I came very near being shot myself . A very large crowd had gathered at the stream of water , and I was reaching over the dead-line in order to get some water . I could not get it anywhere else , as I had no right to the wells . A bullet came , I should judge , within two or three inches of my right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortally wounding another . These men were in their tents , unoffending . Q. Were all these twenty-five or forty men shot by the sentries for crossing the dead-line or being near it ? A. Some were across it , and others not . I saw a man shot who was three feet inside the dead-line . I saw one shot on the 10th of July , just the day before the men whom we called the raiders were hung . Q. Describe the circumstances that led to the men being shot . A. I do not know , except from the great desire of sentries to get furloughs . Q. Did you ever hear any order given by the prisoner in reference to firing grape and canister on the prisoners in the stockade ? A. He gave an order ; I did not hear it ; but there was an order given  --  ( Interrupted by counsel for the accused : ) Q. What order did you ever hear him give ? A. Captain Wirz planted a range of flags inside the stockade , and gave the order , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hundred ( that was the number ) should gather in any one spot beyond those flags and near the gate , he would fire grape and canister into them . " Captain Wirz gave this order I was speaking of to the crowd of prisoners around the gate . He merely told them he would fire upon them if they gathered there . I did not hear him give the order to the men outside . IIe warned us that if we gathered there in numbers he would fire upon us . Q. Then it was not an order , but simply a warning ? A. Yes , sir . TESTIMONY OF J. B. WALKER . John Burns Walker testified : 1 I was in the military service of the United States , in Company G , 141st Pennsylvania Infantry . I was a prisoner at Andersonville from June 16 , 1864 , till May 26 , 7.865 . I was wounded on the evening of May 28 , 1864 , at Hanover Junction , Va. , and was taken to Richmond on the 30th ; from there to Danville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the 16th of June . . . . I know the name of a prisoner who was shot by a sentry and killed . I have a memorandum from which I can state it with certainty . On the 4th of September , 1864 , a prisoner belonging to the 7th Indiana Infantry , whose name was Morris Prendiville , was asleep in his tent about 10 o'clock in the evening . His quarters were near mine . I heard the report and went out . There was a little commotion at the quarters where the prisoner was shot . When I got opposite the tent I found something under my feet , and on looking down I found the man 's brain and blood on the path . His feet were toward the dead-line , about three feet from it ; his head was toward the path . He had been wounded in // battle and afterwards brought to Andersonville . He had been there only a few days when he was shot . I reported the case next morning to Captain Wirz . I left a report at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was shot in the head , the ball scattering his brains about . I know the man 's name was Prendiville , because I wrote it on a paper and pinned it on his breast ; I wrote the cause of his death ? that he was shot by the guard ? and I pinned the paper on his shirt bosom . I made a memorandum at the time for myself , and I have it here . I wrote this on the morning after the man 's death . Witness produced the memorandum , which was read , as follows : " Morris Prendiville , Company H , 7th Indiana Regiment , infantry ; shot through the head on the night of the 4th of September , 1864 , by the rebel guard . He was asleep in his tent , directly opposite the post . The guard had no cause to commit the crime . " THE JUDGE ADVOCATE : I desire to call the attention of the court to the following extract from the hospital register : " 11,230 , Prendiville , M. , private 7th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September 6th ; died September 6th ; died in quarters . " WITNESS continued : I do not know the names of any others who were killed . On the 5th of August , 1864 , five men were shot . I did not take their names . Four of them were shot at the branch , and one of them near the northeast corner , inside the stockade . Three of them were shot at one time ; one was killed and two were wounded . Such shooting was a frequent occurrence at that place . My rations were stopped while I was at Andersonville ; on the 3d of July the sergeants came in and told us that we were going to have a fine time on the 4th of July , that we would have an extra ration . The 4th of July came and we had no rations at all . The rations were frequently stopped . The crime of any man not being able to report , or any sergeant not being able to report the number of men , was considered a sufficient cause for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those whom I could not account for . Sometimes it was not possible for all the men to be present . Sick men had to leave and go to places where it was necessary for them to go , and they would not be able to get back in time . I generally found men from other squads who had been counted , and filled up the vacancies with them . We were not doing anything when the sergeant came in on the 3d of July and spoke to us in regard to our rations . We had not been attempting to break out that day . I used to hear about a plan to break out , but I never could find any organization . Such an attempt was not the cause for stopping our rations . I never knew of any organization to break out ; I knew of some tunneling . I guess the rations were not stopped because there had been tunneling . I do not know ; I know that we had the promise of a good day on the 4th , and we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time anything about tunneling out . TESTIMONY OF C. II . RUSSELL . Chas . II . Russell , recalled for the prosecution , testified : 1 I saw acts of cruelty committed at Andersonville by a man named Duncan ; I believe his name was James Duncan . I understood that he was a rebel quarterfootnote Record , p. 366. // master . He used to come in with the wagon bringing in the bread . He issued it out to the sergeants of detachments . . . . I saw Duncan in this courtroom ; I see him now . Witness pointed out the man to whom he referred . I About the 10th day of June , 1864 , he came in with some bread , and I with six other men of my detachment was detailed to go down and help him to bring up the bread . A fellow belonging to my 100 ? I do n't know his name ; he belonged to a Tennessee regiment ? came down with me , and while we were getting the bread , or rather while we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece of crust broke off and this man stooped down to pick it up ; as soon as he did so , Duncan jumped out of the wagon and struck him , and kicked him twice or three times severely . The man died three or four days afterwards in a tent in the stockade . Before that occurred he was just as healthy as I was , and I thought his chance of getting out was fully as good ; he had as good a tent as mine was . Another instance was three or four days afterwards , about the 13th of June . My tent was close to the gate where the wagon stopped and where the bread was issued . This Duncan was issuing bread again . A poor fellow , about half-witted , who stayed on the north side of the stockade , came over there . He went to get some bread . I did not see the commencement of the affair , and could not tell whether he wanted to steal some or not ; at all events , I saw Duncan jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . The man jumped up and Duncan knocked him down again , then picked him up and threatened to throw him inside the dead-line and let the guard shoot him . The man went away and that was the last I saw of him . The first occurrence which I have narrated occurred about the 10th of June . I do not know the man 's name whom I saw Duncan kick ; he belonged to a Tennessee regiment . I do not know the name of the second man . I saw him about the camp , but I never knew his name ; he was a half-witted fellow . That is all I know about acts of cruelty committed by Duncan . TESTIMONY OF W. W. CRANDALL . W. W. Crandall , recalled for the prosecution , testified I knew a man at Andersonville named Duncan . That pointing him out in court is the man . Ite had charge of the cook-house there . During the first time I was there he used to come into the stockade with rations . During the latter part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first days of October , 1864 , I was in the ball-and-chain-gang . I saw him and another man named Barr bring a man to put in the stocks . His name was James Armstrong . IIe belonged to an Ohio regiment ; the number of the regiment I can not tell . They put him in what they called the " spread-eagle stocks , " and after putting him in they took from him his money and a picture . I heard Armstrong plead with Duncan for the picture , saying either that it was a picture of his sister or of his mother . He did not get it . He was left there three or four hours , when Duncan came back alone and took him out , saying that he was // going to send him away on the cars . I heard Armstrong at the time ask Duncan if he could not give him back that picture . The answer was , " You may consider yourself damned fortunate to get away at all , and that you are not put in the ball-and-chain-gang with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he took except the money and picture . I do not know how much money . The man told me the amount while he was still in the stocks . I think he stated the sum was about eight or nine dollars in greenbacks . I do not know of any other special acts of cruelty by Duncan . TESTIMONY OF S. M. RIKER . Samuel M. Riker testified : 1 I have been in the military service of the United States , in the 8th New Jersey Volunteers . I was taken prisoner the 22d of June , 1864 . I was taken first to Richmond and from there to Andersonville , where I arrived on the 10th of July . I saw the prisoner the day I arrived there . I went there with some six hundred Union prisoners , and was taken immediately to Captain Wirz 's headquarters . We were compelled to stand there under the burning sun , without shade , and without water , between three and four hours . The men were formed in four ranks and were ordered to remain so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if possible , from boys passing with canteens for soldiers . They were cautioned frequently not to do it . One man who stepped out was struck on the head with the butt of a gun by one of Captain Wirz 's sergeants , whose name I do not know . The man was insensible for some time . Many of the men standing there fainted away from exposure and the heat of the sun . It would probably be called sun-stroke . They were carried and laid under trees , and were not taken into the stockade with us . Soon after we were all turned into the stockade . Next day raw rations were issued to us . We had no wood to cook them , and of course were hungry for a long time before we got enough used to the ways of the stockade to obtain wood and materials for cooking . . . . I know of two cases of shooting in the stockade . The men were not acquaintances of mine , not men that I knew . I kept a diary while there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so blurred and rubbed out that I can not read it , and can not give the names . The men were shot in July , near the place where they used to get water to drink from the stream . The persons shooting them were younger men , who were on guard . The first man I saw shot was shot in the breast . 1 saw him after he was carried away . He died a few minutes afterwards . He was shot by a mere boy , probably not more than fourteen years old . That was about the middle of July , soon after I was taken into the stockade , which was on the 10th of July . It was on the 11th that the six raiders were hung . I saw the next man shot in the latter part of July . It was at the same place as the other , or very near it , where he was getting water . footnote'Record , p. 368. // TESTIMONY OF C. E. SMITH . Charles E. Smith testified I am in the service of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4th United States Cavalry . I went to Andersonville on the 2d of May , 1864 , and remained till the 12th of September . I. saw four men shot in the stockade . I saw three shot together , the one ball taking effect on the three of them . One of them was killed instantly , another died in about an hour , and the third died in about two days afterwards . I think that was about the 10th of June . I do not know the men 's names . They were shot at the creek by the sentinel on post . Only one sentinel fired . I saw a man shot on the north side of the stockade . He was reaching under the deadline to pick up a piece of bread which some other man had thrown out of his haversack . The sentinel shot him from his post . I think this was about the 10th of May . I got there a very few days before . The man died instantly . I think the man was in his right mind , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first shooting . The man was stooping at the dead-line for water , when Captain Wirz told the sentry to fire at him . The sentinel hesitated and would not do it . Captain Wirz drew his own revolver and said to the sentinel that if he did not shoot them damned Yankees he would shoot him . It was after that remark , by Captain Wirz , that the sentinel fired and hit these three men . I heard Captain Wirz order men to be vaccinated . He came in one day with the doctor . They had been vaccinating three or four days . He came to our detachment that morning and gave the sergeant orders that every man should be there and vaccinated . They went in to vaccinate , and they vaccinated most of the ninety . I was vaccinated myself , and I went to the brook and washed it , and sucked the blood out of my arm and stopped it . Other men who were vaccinated at the same time came near losing their arms , and I do not know but what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big sores in the arms where the matter was put in , and the flesh rotted away , and there came big sores under the arms . I can not say that I saw any cases where the sores did not spread in that manner . I saw mostly all of them with very large sores , bigger than a silver half-dollar . I never saw them get well while I was there , except they did the same thing that I did to get it out of their blood . Captain Wirz said that any man who would refuse to obey his orders would have a ball and chain put on . That order was carried out . There was one man named Shields , belonging to the 2d Iowa Infantry , who refused to be vaccinated . They took him out and put a ball and chain on him until he consented to have the matter put on his arm . I saw him after he was vaccinated . He went and washed it out , and got well shortly afterwards . I know very well that the prisoner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comrades were digging a tunnel , when he and some more of the rebels found it out , and came in with prodding irons to find out where it was . They confiscated our blankets and what little meal we had , and took all away from us . I know he could use his right arm very well then . footnote 1 Record , p 369. // Our rations were stopped there for the 3d , 4th , and 5th of July ; we got no rations at all . I have seen men , in a starving condition , on the bank of the swamp picking up beans which had passed through men , and go wash and eat them . TESTIMONY OF CHARLES T. WILLIAMS . Charles T. Williams testified : 1 I was in the 1st New Jersey Cavalry . I arrived at Andersonville Marsh 12 , 1864 , and remained in the stockade till August 30th of the same year . I was then taken out to the hospital , and stayed there till March 25 , 1865 . Dr. White was in charge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stevenson , after him Dr. Clayton .

I can not tell by whose order . I have heard Captain Wirz order men into the stocks , and seen the sergeant on the way to put them in . It was on March 25 , 1865 , when we were down to Captain Wirz 's headquarters , being about to arrive there . One of the men did not answer to his name . Captain Wirz ordered the sergeant to go and put the man in the stocks . His name was Darling . I do n't know bow long he remained in the stocks . I never saw him afterwards . I have seen the chain-gang . I was in the stockade at the time , and was not very near them . I do not know why the men were put in the chain-gang . I saw the hounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made their escape . I saw men who had been caught by them . I have seen them brought back by them . I never saw any men bitten by them . There was one catch-dog , and the others were what they call plantation dogs . The catch-dog was a sort of bull-dog , and the others were more of a hound . I was at Andersonville station three or four times . I was there in March , 1865 , just before leaving , and also last December . Never prior to that . I saw a storehouse there . I should judge it was about 125 feet long , and thirty or thirty-five feet wide . I saw men shot by the sentinels . I saw two men shot in the stockade , and one in the hospital . I can not give any exact date . I can not tell what month it was ; it was such a common occurrence that I never took the dates or months . I saw one man shot at the south gate , as we called it , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I saw one man shot at the north side . This man shot at the gate was a cripple ; they called him " Chickamauga . " The next case , the man , I do n't know his name , was shot at the dead-line on the north side of the stockade . I do not know in what month . The man was killed . Captain Wirz was not present at the time the man was shot at the north side . I did not hear anything said by the person who shot him as to why the man was shot . He was shot because he reached over or under the dead-line to get a piece of bread that lay there . He died . I saw one roan shot in the hospital . He went up to the fence to speak to the guard . He wanted to do some trading . The guard fired at him . I do not know whether any one ordered the guard to shoot . I do n't know his name . IIe was a cripple afflicted with scurvy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
