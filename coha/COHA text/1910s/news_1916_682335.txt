txt The Chairman of the Committee On Military Affairs of the United States Senate has reported a bill " making further and more effectual provision for the national defense , " and for other purposes . In so far as It concerns the increase and more perfect organization of the regular army it is an admirable instrument , probably because the committee had the benefit of the experience of Senator Henry A. du Pont of I Delaware . one of its members , who graduated at the head of his class at the United States Military Academy at West Point and was a. distinguished and gallant officer of artillery in the ! great war of the rebellion which is now for politeness ' sake called the " war , " although it is said by those who were in it that it was very uncivil . That part of the proposed bill , however , ' which undertakes to make the militia of the United States a second line of defense is doomed to utter failure ; first , because many of its provisions are unconstitutional . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as experience has shown , meet with no practical response . Another bill , introduced in the House of Representatives , while providing for an increase in the regular army , contains provisions as to using the militia equally unconstitutional and objectionable as those in the Senate bill . Governors of States and members of the State Legislatures and the people of the country generally are not aware of , some of the provisions of these bills , and it has been intimated in the press ' that the throwing aside of the proposition of the late Secretary of War Garrison , based . it is said , upon the recommendation of the General Staff of the Army and the Army War College , is due to the persistent and energetic ' efforts of a small National Guard officers ' eing , which , having no political influence , has , nevertheless , for several years been determined to have partial support from Federal pay . That the country should be adequately prepared for national defense , as distinguished from military aggression , is undeniable , but , within a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hysteria on the subject of haste , due to a condition of unpreparedness that all know . The Army and Naval Journal , which for more than half a century has been a valued exponent on this subject , in its latest issue says : The latest returns from the War Department show a nominal total for the Guard ( meaning organized militia ) of 8,705 officers and 120,693 men , 129.398 in all . We doubt whether , taking the country as a hole , more than 50 per cent , of these could be depended upon to be mustered In as volunteers after deducting the physeallY unfit men and married men with families depending upon them . ? ? ? The strain now is getting ton great for many officers who are active in business . This illustrates the difficulties attending the attempt to make use of the National Guard ( meaning organized militia ) under present conditions . Mr. Stimson , Secretary of War under President Taft , and the late Secretary of War Garrison , and now Secretary of War Baker , all express opposition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forty-eight States . and in addition Major Gen. Wood and the General Staff of the ' Army , it is said , do not favor it . In a report of the Chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs to the House of Representatives are some very specious quotations , one from Patrick Henry of Virginia , in which the orator in the Virginia State Convention was , with all his eloquence and strength , opposing the Federal Constitution , and the other quotations from Presidents Washingtc re Madison . and Monroe , who , while lauding the desirability or an efficient militia , did not touch upon the points now to be discussed . The Framers of the Constitution of 1757 had in view indestructible States in an Indestructible Union , and , while they gave authority to the President in three Instances only to use the militia , those organizations were intended as State torees , a home guard for home purposes . Almost all the rights of the individual in the American form of government are under the States , which are sovereign for certain purposes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national purposes , in their relation to foreign powers , and for regulation of commerce between the States of the Union and for jurisdiction over its territories , and for a. national Post Office system and kindred subjects . The Constitutional Convention of 1787 had in view a Federal Government so arranged that the several States of the Union could not be oppressed and should have power to execute their own laws and to have an adequate militia . So important were these considerations that because one subject had been omitted in the Constitution , Immediately afterward , among the nine amendments , was inserted this clause as Article 2 : A wen regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free State , the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be Infringed . and the Supreme Court of the United states has held that this clause was a restriction upon the power of Congress alone against interfering with the right of the people to keep and bear arms . The tenth article of amendment declared that : The powers not delegated to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . The Constitution is very significant in the powers granted to Congress upon this subject . One of them is to declare war and grant letters of marque and reprisal . A second is to raise and support armies , but no appropriation of money for that use shall be for a longel term than two years . In other words , they did not intend to give the Commander in Chief permanent , absolute authority . That power to raise and support armies " is a plenary Federal power and Congress may make " rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces . " When we come to the militia , the class of powers is different , so as not to interfere with the State authority . The first is to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union . to suppress insurrection and repel invasion . In other words , Congress provides , by law , how and in what manner they shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that the authority over the militia , thus limited , is of a local character , and that the militia can not be ordered out of the United States by the Commander in Chief in case of a foreign war . President saw this in the Spanish-American six months ' war and I undertook to turn the militia into volunteer regiments , with new enlistments and new commissions for the officers . Thus , under the plea of " raising troops , " to deprive the States of their ' local protection , and in New York state ; it is said , nearly all its organized militia were thus taken away , leaving the State defenseless in case of invag sion , insurrection , tumult , riot . oe breach of the peace , or imminent danger thereof . The power of Congress over the Is not the same as " to raise and support armies . " It is " to provide for organizing , arming , and disciplining the militia , and for governing such pate . of them as may be employed in the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectively , the appointment of the officers , and the authority of training the militia according to the disciWine prescribed by Congress . " In a report of the Chairman of the Committee oil Military Affairs to the House of Representatives is a specious argumenta said to be prepared by the Military Council of the State of Midsouri , and believed to be an emanation of the so-called National Guard As-. sociation . In looking at this clause in the Constitution concerning the militia , it is significant from the language used that Congress is not given power to organize the militia like the porter given to raise troops , but merely , by law , to enact a form of organization for the militia , so that it shall be uniform in the several States throughout the United States , and then only to govern such parts of them as may be employed in the service of the United States . " Employed ' ' means for a limited purpose , which the Constitution has fixed in another clause , not enlisted for a fixed period but only employed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurrection or repel invasion or to execute the laws of the Union , and the theory submitted to the House of Representatives by its Committee on Military Affairs , that Congress may organize the militia the same as it may raise troops , is a most dangerous and unconstitutional one under our theory of Government If the convention of 1787 had intended Congress should have the power to organize the militia , it would have said so , just as it gave it power " to raise troops , " but that question is settled by a century and a quarter of precedent during which Congress has from time to time enacted how the militia of the several States , for sake of uniformity , should be organized in order to be efficient , but never undertook or Ventured to undertake by Federal authority to infringe on the right of the several States to organize their militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress . In a report submitted to the House of Representatives these specious sentences are Tound : " But it is contended that the General Government has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has prescribed . " Surely , if Congress has the power under the Constitution to prescribe certain things , It roust have the power to enforce what it prescribes . If It has such powers . it also has the power to prevent the defeat or its laws enacted la pursuance of those powers . In Houston vs . Moore ( e Wheaton 1 ) the United States Supreme Court Itscussed this question as to the power of Congress to provide for organizing , arming , and disciplining the militia , and remarked that Congress " had provided for all these subjects in the way which that body must have supposed the best calculated to promote the general welfare , and to provide for the national defense . " The court further said : The manner in which the militia is to be organized , armed , disciplined , and governed is fully prescribed : provisions are made for drafting . detaching , and calling forth the State quotas when required by the President . These provisions of the Militia Act of Congress of May 8 , 1792 , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court solely with reference to when they are called into the service of the United States for one or other of the three purposes where the President could command them . Nevertheless , in the report as to the " Power of the Federal Government , over the Militia under the Constitution , " it is boldly claimed , alluding to this decision , that " save and except the appointment of officers reserved to the States but one power remains In the States , and that is to train the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress . " In other words , the States are practically to be bereft of their own militia  --  and it Is to be wholly a Federal affair . In answer , however , to this . the Constitution gives no such plenary authority . The President , by the Constitution , " shall be Commander in Chief of the Militia of the several States , when called into actual service of the United States , " for one of the three purposes only , where he may command the militia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Commander in Chief over the militia , except in such instances . certainly no lower Federal authority can by an Act of Congress be authorized to command them . When the Constitution was adopted in 1789 , every one of the thirteen States had its militia organized under its laws , and the Governor in each State , then and ever since , has been Commander in Chief of its militia , except when called into the actual service of the United States , and , under Article N .. of the Amendments to the Constitution , the Powers not delegated to the United Stales by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the States are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . The power to provide for governing the militia is only given to Congress for such part as may be employed in the service of the United States . Congress can not , therefore , constitutionally provide for governing any part of the militia not employed in the service of the United States . That authority Is reserved to the States , and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Therefore , as Congress can only provide , by proper enactment , for organizing , arming , and disciplining the militia and the government over them in time of ordinary peace is not a granted power , but rests in the several States , their respective Legislatures may prescribe military offenses and modes and kinds of punishment and whatever they May deem necessary , not Congress , for governing their militia . As if more strongly to emphasize this authoritYAof the States , the Constitution reserves lb the States " the appointment of the officers and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress . " The reserved authority to appoint the officers shows that they are State officers , commissioned by the State and a State force , a ? Home Guard , for its own local purposes , under the Governor as Commander in Chief . Thin has always been the theory of our Government . illustrated in many statutes , State and national , and it is too late now to attempt to encroach On reserved rights .
