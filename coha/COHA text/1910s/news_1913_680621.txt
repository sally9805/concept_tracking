txt Ungentlemanly Smokers . One point stands out very prominently in the current comment on the abuse of tobacco . The effect of nicotine is to dull the sensibilities . It is a powerful depressant of good manners , rendering its victims heedless of the discomfort they inflict upon other people . Thus it comes to pass that courtesy and chivalrous politeness have become lost arts among us . A man who deliberately denies himself a pleasure for a. brief interval of the day lest he prove a public nuisance is regarded as effeminate . Any man who lights a cigarette or a pipe or a cigar in any house other than his own without first obtaining the consent of the rightful occupant thereof is a boor , no matter what degree of culture he may possess . And one who smokes In a public conveyance or place of meeting , whdther conscious or not that others present only refrain from protesting against his rudeness because they hate a scene , is a hog , in spite of any fancied title to gentility.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
