txt With their experience in 1907 reasonably fresh in mind New York bankers-were not surprised that the reports of condition of national banks showed that it was interior institutions which were hoarding money and not the banks of this city . In regard to Secretary 's criticism of these intitutions , they accordingly have little more to say than that the Secretary might have known long ago the habits of many interior institutions in times of stress . Recognition of the New York banks as the banks which dip into reserves and exercise patriotic functions in parlous times would he better appreciated if not so belated . The situation in respect to the reserves of New York and interior banks was similar in 1907 . Then , as was established by figures published long after the panic . hundreds of interior banks held reserves far above the legal requirements , while the New York banks paid our their reserves to a much greater extent than has been at all necessary this year . All through that 1907 panic , interior banks complained that they could not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was their excuse for refusing to extend credit . The country at large believed the excuse was valid . As a matter of fact , these banks held millions of cy above reserve requirements.  - -   - -  -   --   - -  As an instance of the difficulties under which New York banks then labored there is recalled the experience of one of the largest banks with a large bank of an important interior center . Coming to New York at the height of the panic , the president of the interior bank declared he absolutely must have currency . Conditions in his section . he said , were deplorable. - There was no money to move the crops , and businees of all kinds was at a standstill because of the lack of currency . If that 's se , " the banker v-as told , " you mall fare all the money you need . " But the New York bank was suspicious and told this interior banker to come back in an boar . Ineeneffine. get .

" The account remains closed to this dayBoth that bankers and other interior bankers were needlessly alarmed in 1907 . Many interior bankers have been needlessly ale rmod this year , though the alarm has not permeated many of the large interior banks . It is just as well , bankers think , that the Treasury Department recognizes at least the real conditions- They recall that not long ago Mr. called for a special : report from New York banks on the ground that they were curtailing credits and that they then said such report would be useful if taken as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interiorIt is believed that Secretary Me.A.doo 's action will go a long way to clear up whatever stringency exists in the money market , and will be particularly beneficial in the steps now being taken by the Federal Reserve Board , In conjunction-with the New York city banks , to satisfy our foreign chligations . Bankers declare that in the crisis of 1907 , a number of country bankers boasted of having a 50'i , to 75% reserve , while their New York correspondents had to pay . a premiere for gold- It is pointed out that the Comptroller 's statement of the condition of national banks , on December 3 , 1907 , showed that while the central reserve ' city banks had a deficit in their reserves of 532,397,690. ! and the reserve city banks had a deficit of $3,503,000. the country banks were carrying a surplus of $103,752,000 on that occasion- No doubt the reports now corning in , in response to the Comptroller of the Currency 's call for condition on September 12 , is disclosing the same state of affairs . Washington  --  Secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that the investigation conducted by the Comptroller of the Currency disclosed that many national hanks in various sections o ' country were boarding money , holding reserves in cases as high as 75'a , and charging interest rates highs : than conditions justified . The Secretary wilt withhold the second instalment of crop moving money , which would have been sent to reserve cities at this time . The threat is made that there will be issued daily a list of those banks who are guilty of hoarding in order to attract attention of the public to the policy of these national banks . The following telegram was sent by the Secretary of the Treasury to ten national banks in four reserve cities in the South : " 1 have decided not to deposit the second instalment of crop moving funds with your banks at this time . You can , however , if you desire , withdraw one-half of the securities deposited by you and use them as security for the issue of additior.al currency if you make application therefor . -I am informed that many banks in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes , and that in many cases good loans are rejected or unreasonable rates of interest are asked . I am also informed that many banks which have taken out additional currency are refusing to use it in spite of great demands for money . " I trust you are not doing . this . I shall withdraw all Government deposits from banks charging excessive rate ; of interest , or which refuse reasonable accounts , and I shall refuse to issue so-called emergency currency to banks which are not making use of it on reasonable terms for the benefit of the business community . It is essential , in the present situation that all pull together in an - unselfish spirit for the good of the country . " I , of course , expect the banks to make a reasonable charge for accommodations . My point is that the charge must be reasonadle , as the co-operation and help of the Treasury will not be extended on any other basis . " The /epee ts national bauee now going receives by the Comptroher of the Currency : n response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 , indicate an exeraordinary hoarding of money by many rational banks in various sections of the country . I am astonished that so many of the national banks are pursuing a course so contrary to the public interest and so indefensible front any point of view . l'nere is neither occasion nor necessity for it . " Full reports have not yet been received by the Comptroller , but they ate coming : n daily . I intend to begin issuing daily a list of the banks which are hoarding money by maintaining excessive reserves /n order that the country may know bow they are performing their public duties . " The reports of national banks are public property anyway , and while they have been published in their respective communites the significance of their statements : is not generally understood . The public does not know now to analyze them .
