SOUTHEAST in Ireland lies the County Wex ford , a fair , serene sur face that covers rich treasury of the sorrow and romance of the many different peoples who chase it for a home , fought to keep it , and died yearning and dispossessed , or triumphant but insecure . At first blush the county is like some fine per sonality , inconspicuous from its very perfection of harmony . It lacks the bold headlands of the north and west of Ire land , and the desolate loveliness of the bog . Its beauty has a softer , more in sinuating quality ; its lures get into one 's blood , and then one understands why the ancient peoples built their great raths and towers and churches on Wexford sod , and gave her a fierce and loving testimony of birth and living and death . The old peoples coming in from the sea to take Wexford must have been struck by its emphatic definition , its pos sibilities as a theater for partisan war fare . Its undulating surface , which measures in miles fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south by the sea . On the west stands Mount Leinster , which has always marked the boundary of the province , while north , to break the back of the winter winds , rise the Black Stairs mountains , the three sharp pinnacles of which are known as the Leaps of Ossian 's Greyhounds . Within , the beautiful river Slaney di vides the land into two unequal parts . On the side of a well-wooded hill is the town of Wexford , which for untold cen turies has stood to the fierce races who wooed the land as a symbol of their might . A thousand years ago the race then in power built a magnificent city wall to keep out all invaders , and ever since then the old streets of Wexford have been so narrow that two vehicles can not pass without special arrange ment . It was there that in the early days the great fair for all Leinster was held , when there was buying and selling , and sports and games , while the chiefs and brehons debated in council . It was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses and the narrow streets echoed to them riding to the hunt or driving in their splendid coaches to the county halls . It was after the Anglo-Norman came that the face of Wexford took on its present appearance . Up to that time there had been old memorial stones and raths , and some forts and castles , but the stout new-comers meant that no one should take from them what they had taken from others , and as a farmer sows his seed , so they sowed Wexford with castles , forts , and abbeys . The county is divided into ten baronies , and in four of them alone there remain one hundred and twenty castles and towers . There are fifty-nine on a surface of less than sixty-three square miles . The castles were very heavily built , with thick masonry and deep windows . They were generally characterized by a single square tower , at one corner of a square battlemented courtyard . From this tower a warden could see from two to six castles ; a beacon signal could soon be spread . These homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flesh of the inhabitants to the eagles . And if there are many ruins about which any Wexford gossoon can tell you the legends , there are others of which nobody knows anything . One is per ? haps driving along a road where the honeysuckle and wild roses arc delicately struggling for mastery , and one sees sud ? denly a square tower rising gaunt and high from a grazing-meadow . On ap ? proaching , one sees the marks of the moat ; one steps through the arched , open doorway and looks up at the roof ? less structure . The stones rise higher and higher ; the blue , serene sky shows above and through the deep , narrow windows ? and on the broken floor is tethered a cow , who gazes blankly at the intruder . Another case of usurpation , and no one can tell whose was the castle , and no one is concerned with the many centuries of living , quiet and stormy , which went on inside these walls . Old-fashioned people are apt to la ? ment the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has degen ? erated . The landholder complains that , with the rents going down and the in- come tax rising , people of his class have much ado to keep going ; that young men of good families are forced to emi ? grate to America , like any gossoon who expects to work with his hands ; that though the rents go down , the laborers and tenants who have always depended on the big house for certain supplies do so still . He will say that the farmers , since their rents have been lowered and they are buying land , are becoming so prosperous that they no longer have the old feudal feeling , but educate their chil ? dren above themselves ; that the com ? mon people in general are no longer as respectful as they were , and that while home rule will ruin the country , still it would not be surprising if it came . The farmers say that home rule is not going necessarily to be good for them , with the income tax increasing , and with England no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show their real feeling for fear of boycott from their laborers and the tradesmen . It is true that they may eat more nowadays than bacon and cabbage and potatoes ; and they can have houses with tiled instead of thatched roofs . But look at the difficulty of getting laborers ! Nowa ? days a government board will build a poor man a cottage on an acre of ground for which he will pay a weekly rent of from eight pence to a shilling ? neat little cottages without a taste of mud about them ! When a laborer can live in a place like that , and has a child or two in America to send him home money , he is not going to work unless he feels like it ; and his son will only work till he has earned enough money to buy a bicycle and a suit of new clothes with which to impress the girls . Until something less than a hundred years ago the inhabitants of Forth and of Bargy spoke a language different from that spoken in the rest of Wexford or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a language that Chaucer and Spenser would have understood . To this day some of the old words still survive , such as " let " for " hindered , " " kennen " for " known , " " math " for " meadow , " " fash " for " shame , " " ractsomc " for " fair , " " redcsman " for " adviser , " " chour " for " giant , " " lewd " for " ashamed . " An angry person will still say , " I 'll make gobbets of you ! " Other Wexford expressions , rarely to be heard in other parts of Ireland , are " re ? negged , " meaning " changed of mind " ; " coknowsure " for a knowing person , " ramshogues " for " foolish stories , " " shandrumdandy " for " broken down , " " sharoose " for " displeased . " Wexford conservatism further shows in the keeping up of many of the old customs . In sonic quarters the match ? maker is still an important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a spinster or widow ? has a long memory for the marriageable girls and boys among the peasantry of the county , and even of adjoining counties . The young people are not at first consulted ; the parents of both are approached , and the talk is not at all of the in ? clinations of those who are to marry , but of how much dower is to go with the girl , and what the young man 's father %Nill allow him . For all their warm hearts , the Irish are practical enough ; they have to be . There is plenty of innocent love-making which never leads to marriage , because the chances for a living in Ireland are lim ? ited , and a couple must have a little degree of certainty about the future . Sometimes a young man cares so much for some particular girl that he breaks through custom and finds a way of mar ? rying her . One youth of the barony Forth loved the daughter of a Wicklow farmer who had two hundred acres and corresponding high ideals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare acres and a bare cottage . He appealed to the sym ? pathies of his neighbors , who straight ? way lent him cows and horses and sheep , carts and machines and furniture , so that when the Wicklow farmer came down to look over the claims of his pro ? spective son-in-law , he saw such shining prosperity that he gladly yielded the daughter . But in general the parents are very keen about the settlements . More than once all negotiations have been stopped because one father would not set a heifer against the feather-bed of the other father . There arc not , as in America , wide , hopeful horizons which promise sufficient heifers and feather-beds . The young people , knowing this , are content to leave the settlement of their marriage to older heads . The story goes that once a hearty , managing dame of Wex ? ford came out to the paddock where her daughter was milking the cow . Worn out with negotiations which had not been entirely to her advantage , she looked sourly at the girl , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be put up to-morrow . You 'll be married in three weeks ' time . " " Who to , mother ? " asked Maureen , timidly . Upon which her mother snapped , " What 's that to you ? " Doubtless Maurecn 's family gave a great dinner , with the priest sitting at the head of the table , and , at the end of the meal , blessing and cutting the bride-cake , each guest giving him some money for taking a slice . Then dancing and drinking would follow far into the night , and perhaps the cost of this hospitality would cripple the bride 's family for a year . Nowadays , if young men or women do not like the marriages which have been arranged , they can borrow from sympathetic friends and slip away to America . Almost invariably these practical marriages turn out well . The young people are pleased to be giventheir own speck of land and their own little cottage ; they are true to each other , and their habit of daily compan ? ionship soon grows into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given up the old custom of the brown shroud . When a Wexfordian is about to die he has brought to him from his own special chest this shroud of brown cloth , usually made by the nuns , and which has already been Messed by the priest . If be is so poor that he does not own one , a neigh ? bor lends him the garment . If he is too near the end to put on the whole gar ? ment , some one guides his arm into a sleeve and helps him hold a lighted can ? dle while the prayers for the dying are said over him . In this way he hopes to escape the pains of purgatory . Almost equally impressive is the curse . An Irishman feels a wrong keenly , but it must go very deep indeed before he will put a curse upon one who has in ? jured him . The harm wrought must have been so heavy that there is no remedy and no chance of personal retali ? ation ; the matter must lie in God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has done the harm fears the curse , feeling it , at least temporarily , almost as much as the man whom he has made suffer . One would not care to witness twice such a scene ? the wronged person , trembling with emotion , on his knees on the green sod , calling down with passionate , vibrant voice this age-old curse upon another who cowers , who can not but dread : " May the grass grow at your door and the fox build his nest on your hearthstone . May the light fade from your eyes , so that you never see what you love . May your own blood rise against you , and the sweetest drink you take be the bitterest c u p of sorrow . May you die without bene ? fit of clergy ; may there he none to shed a tear at your grave , and may t h e hearthstone of hell be your best bed for ever ! " There are some Wexford people who will tell you that the fairies went away when Parnell was thrust out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they blame Parnell . The young people do not believe in fairies any more , but many of their elders do . They know that if the hot ? ter does not come they have done something to offend the Good Little People , such as throwing our water after sundown , or blessing themselves when they put their foot on a rath where fairies live , for these fear a blessing like red-hot iron . The old men and women , if they sneeze , say , " God between me and harm , " to keep the fairies from getting power over them . Any young man or woman who is very beautiful or is a good dancer , it is said , is liable to be stolen by the Good Little People . There ale many stories such as the one about John Fitz James , who dropped dead as he kissed his bride in the church , and for years the knowledge ? able persons who are called fairy doctors tried to bring him back from fairyland , but they never succeeded , for his beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairy changeling is put in the cradle in the place of a new-born child . He is to be rec ? ognized because he is old-looking and ill to please , with wise , watch ? ing eyes . Then a fairy doctor should be called in , who will fill a cup of oatmeal , and saying over rt.a prayer in Irish , and cover ? ing it with a cloth , he will apply it to the back , heart , and sides of the changeling . If it be a fairy , half the meal disap ? pears , and the rest is made into three small cakes , and baked for the mother to cat , one each morning . On the third morning the spill is broken , and the changeling goes hack to fairyland , leaving the rightful child in its place . Sometimes these doctors give a prospective mother a pishogue , or charm , to keep the fai ? ries out for the fi st nine days after the baby 's hirrh . Nowhere in Wexford could you find a laborer who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old forts made by the prehistoric peoples . These round or square mounds often occupy a good many square yards of space , and the use of them is coveted by the landlords , who know this unused land is especially rich and do not like to sec it wasted . But they can not contend against the many stories of men who dug into raths and were blinded by some sharp thing the fairies threw into their eyes , or who put down the spade and went home to sicken and die . It is not safe to work near land where the fairies have been offended . The Good Little People will never be dispossessed in Wexford . Many other superstitions still linger . People no longer light fires on May ? day in the milking-yards and jump over them , afterward driving the cattle through the flame , following an old cus ? tom which is supposed to have had some relation to the Druid fire-offerings to Baal . Even now some people watch their cattle carefully about May-time , or even inclose them in a paddock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ por ? tion in the name of the devil , there would be little butter for a twelve ? month . People do n't like to meet a red ? headed woman in the morning , for that betokens an ill journey . They often count magpies , for one means sorrow ; two , luck ; three , a wedding ; and four a death . It is said that the blood of a black cat 's tail , laid on a wound with a raven 's feather , will effect a cure , and that the milk of a white cow drawn by a maiden 's hand will ease heartache . Nine hairs plucked from the tail of a wild colt and bound the ninth day after birth around a baby 's ankle will make him sure and swift of foot . A hen that crows should be killed . The cock 's warnings should he heeded ; if one rises early to start on a journey , and the cock crows , that means it will be unlucky to go so soon . One should never fill up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will come back . It is bad luck to stumble in a graveyard or fall from a car at a funeral , and a mother should never go to the grave of her first child . Moreover , coffins should be un ? screwed , so that the dead may rise easily on the last day . When an old proprietor dies , the birds and the bees always desert the place . The will-u ' - the- wisp is the spirit of a man who was banished from heaven and hell because he had offended both God and the devil . It is well to have pity on a frog in the road , for once frogs were Christian people . On Shrove Tuesday they still practise pancake tossing in Wexford . The eldest daughter of the man of the house begins . Upon her success in tossing depends her luck for the year . If she fails to toss the pancake high in the air , and turn it neatly , she can have no chance of mar ? riage for a twelvemonth . On St. Stephen 's Day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunt the wren , because it was the bird which be ? trayed Christ ; they impale the little bodies on holly bushes . They keep many feast-days still ; at Christmas and Easter time especially they have long holidays . In addition there is Twelfth Night , St. Bridget 's Day , St. Patrick 's Day , the Feast of the Invention of the Cross ; St. John 's Day , when they still light fires on the hills ; the Feast of St. Luke the Evangelist ; the Feast of Our Lady , and St. Martin 's Day . And they still have " pattern days , " when they pray at the holy wells . The Wexford people , like all the Irish who live in the country , have marked spiritual qualities . Long , solitary hours of walking by the roads that lead to the sea , and past their many empty towers and castles , eloquent of other years and other men ? gone , who knows whither ? ? have brought them near to unseen powers , religious and traditional . They are as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night . " Ah , then , " says old Mogue , the " dark fiddler , " perhaps a descendant of one of the old bards so reverenced by the Wexford people , " you are asking me why I smile , sitting by my lone in the doorway , with only the warmth of the sun on my face to tell me there is light at all . I am smiling because I heard a lovely thing ? the voice of our blessed Lord 's mother . Grander it was than the whispering of the Little People I hear sometimes hark beyond in the rath . " All the inhabitants have a deep love for their home . It is perhaps because their ancestors fought so fiercely for every rod of the land that their descendants are loath to leave their country . The scenes when our emigrant says farewell to his home and his neighbors are distressing in the extreme . Sometimes , indeed , the call of the sod is too strong for the prospective exile . " Your Michael did n't go to America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose son had a ticket for New York . " Ah no , ma'am ; the yellow clay held his feet , and his mother 's milk got about his heart , and he could n't go . " Michael gives various un ? sentimental reasons why he remained , but he finally says , " Sure , I could n't Faye my mother alone with a long , soft family to bring up ; and her heart was in me , and sure it 's hard to draw the heart of a woman back . " " Ah , well , " says Mrs. Mur ? phy , with vague religious flavor in her tone , " there 's many a thing falls out be ? tween the milking of the cow and the print of butter com ? ing to the table . " But the Wexford people are not all compact of ten ? derness and spirituality . They are many-sided . At their markets , when they are haggling about prices , they show the most perfect acting of in ? dignation , despair , surprise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach their neighbors . They have keen , hard heads and long memories . When in an expressive mood , they can talk by the hour on all sorts of subjects , from folk-lore two thousand years old to the current local affairs of the parish , and their talk reveals shrewd observation and a high , critical faculty , sarcastic humor , exaggeration , and even personal attack . Let half a dozen of them meet around the fire after a nipping day , with a slight grievance against some neigh ? bor who has offended by having secured a widely desired appointment from the county council , and the fortunate lis ? tener will hear some vivid remarks . They do n't mean what they say , and they would do any amount of kindness for the neighbor , but they can not resist giving play to their tongues . " I saw Tim Dugan - coming up the street just now , " says one . " He was not drunk , but he had drink taken , and he had a face on him would frighten a horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asks a listener , though every one knows Tim Dugan has never been suspected of murder . " Sure , he 'd not stir a finger to lift a red herrin ' off a gridiron , but he 'd ask your ? self to lift the rock of Gibraltar . " " Ah , " puts in a third speaker , with mock sympathy , " sure the poor crather spends his strength running about giv ? ing advice to his neighbors . He 's so generous with his absence from his own field that he 's out of his gates twenty times for once he comes in . And I would n't say he tosses his little finger too high drinks too hard ; sure he never drinks except when he 's alone or with a friend . " This is appreciated , and then some one says : " I 'd not be after calling him a liar , exactly . Sure , he was complimenting Mr. Carew on the speech he made , and says Mr. Carew , ' Tell me , then , Tim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And says me bold Tim , ' Sure , it was n't a particular part , so to speak , but your perservarance , the way you went over it and over it . ' " After the laughter subsides , the same man continues : " That one , if he was courting , would tic many a knot with his tongue he could n't untie with his teeth , and if he had to follow the track of his own words , it 's a grand hunt he 'd give himself . I 'm thinking ' t is a fine thing for his wife he 's single . " " Sure , " answers a former speaker , " I 'm thinking marriage is on his mind . For says I to him , thinking I 'd incense him into a little law , him being so above himself with his new office , says Ito him , Tim , what is the penalty for bigamy ? ' and he says back to me , ' Two mothers ? in aw . ' " Nor are smuggling stories lacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? holder of Barony Forth with more en ? terprise than money . He and his de ? voted tenantry decided to cheat the excise . He got a ship , and began a trade with Holland in tobacco and gin . When his ship would arrive at night on the Wexford coast he would go out with a trusty man or two to meet it in a small boat , some of his tenants guarding the store with stones in their hands to repel all intruders . Others were standing in their peat-carts , ready to carry away the merchandise . The landlord , once the wares were landed , stood on an up ? turned cart and sold on the spot to likely peasants , who , in their turn , would dis ? pose of the tobacco and liquor to dealers throughout the county . The authori ? ties made the greatest efforts to trap this business-like gentleman , but he was never caught . They searched every ? body who came off his place except the people in the funeral processions , who bore coffins full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloaks . On the occasion when the gaugers stormed the cottages of the peasants they found the whole community ap ? parently ill with smallpox , and they fled , leaving the landlord to make prosperity for himself and his tenants . But despite old stories , Wexford is ceasing to live in the past . Looking out of some old window in Wexford town , it might not seem so , as one sees the irregular sky - lines , made of drooping roofs and sagging chimneys , and , beyond , the broken towers on seacoast and hill , while near by the little gardens creep inside walls , whence the stones and mor ? tar are falling . About the town , in such a glance , there scents an air of crumbling decay . It is almost as if the people inside are holding together their narrow , bleak-faced old houses . The little alleys and streets shrink together , as if it were of no use to go very far , as if it would be safer to stop inside those bounds still marked by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the quay ? on that long , well-built water-front where the ships used to anchor ? there seems at first glance again an atmosphere of decay . An old hulk lies in a water-nook . A few aged men talk in couples ? their work , too , past . But then , it is seen that the old men are not merely idle ; they are waiting for something . A little sloop comes in and begins unloading . A boat puts up a sail and scuds across the wide breast of the river Slaney . Over the long Wexford bridge above the green waters pass the young men and women , going to and from their work in Wexford town . In those young faces there is no sign of crumbling age , no looking backward . It is they who put life in the old sagging houses ; it is their hope and spirit that goes marching up and down the narrow , twisting streets .
