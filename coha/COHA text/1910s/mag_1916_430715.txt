 |p511  AS a pert paragrapher has remarked , the Federal Rural Credit Bill will get nothing for the man who has got nothing for himself . It is not a wizard 's trick of pulling a fat goose out of an empty hat ; it is not a miracle-working plan of making wealth out of poverty it is not a good fairy to give a farm for the wishing . Nor is it , as a smug New York editor has declared , " a crazy Socialistic experiment ; " nor is it , as the New York Chamber of Commerce implies , an exceptional or unwarrantable or dangerous employment of governmental power for the benefit , of a class . - As in most cases of excited contention , the truth lies midway between these extremes . I speak particularly of the pending Federal legislation because that is now a matter in the public mind , and because it is , in prospect , a somewhat epochal effort of the National Government to stabilize ? and by stabilizing to cheapen -- land credit in the United States . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill and the House another . They differ in detail , but they are substantially the same in principle and in policy . They are variations and revisions of the original Hollis-Bulkeley Bill of the last session . They provide for the appointment of a farm loan board of three to five members to establish and supervise twelve district farm loan banks with a capital of $500.000 to 5750.000 each , with power to issue farm mortgage bonds or debentures in twenty times the amount of the capital stock , and for the organization of local borrowing associations to be members of the district bank , somewhat after the form of the organization and relation of the Federal Reserve banking system . The capital of the district banks is to be offered to the public , and the Government is to subscribe such part of the capital as the public does not subscribe ? precisely as provided for the capitalization of the twelve Federal Reserve banks . Assuming that the public will subscribe none of the capital , the Government will invest twelve times $500,000 or $750.000 , but this investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bills provide that the local borrowing associations must subscribe to the stock of the district bank in proportion to its loans from the bank , and that the individual borrower must subscribe to the stock of the local association in proportion to his loans . The bills provide for both limited and unlimited common liability forms of organization of the local association , so that the borrowers of each group may elect whether they will use one or the other . Thus , in due course of development , if the system succeeds , the Government 's stock in the banks will be replaced by the stock of the local borrowing associations , as the stock in the Federal Reserve banks is owned by the member banks . The bills provide also for joint stock land banks without membership in the district banks , and for lending directly to individuals where there are no local associations ; but these and other details of accommodation , adaptation , and safety need not be discussed in this brief review of the broad problem which Congress is endeavoring to solve . and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers . I am careful to add in this connection that it would be almost a miracle of legislative wisdom if the law which is presently to emerge from the two houses of Congress should be perfect in every detail . It is a new subject ; it is an experiment ; but it is a composite of the conclusions of the ablest economists and of intelligent statesmen who have labored industriously for about three years . I would have written a different bill so perhaps would every man who has studied the subject but this is the best that can be obtained ; it is a start in the right direction , and a year or two of experience will exhibit its defects for amendment . This has been the way of interState commerce regulation , and of all important measures of economic reform . As to its paternalism , I challenge a comparison with the Federal Reserve banking system , which puts the Government 's credit behind commercial paper and makes the Government a partner with the Reserve bank in the profits of the institution . As to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger than the powers of the Federal Reserve Board , and we may fairly assume that the farm loan board will be as discreet as the Federal Reserve Board . As to the invoking of Government stimulation and regulation of land credit , I submit that the  |p512  same service has been rendered for commercial credit . I have great respect for bankers . but it will be acknowledged that the bankers of the United States made such a sorry mess of commercial finance , with recurring panics and wildly fluctuating rates , that they were persuaded reluctantly to accept the Federal Reserve device of a college professor , and now they boast it as if it were their own invention . The banker is a slave of habit and custom to him what is is right and change is dangerous . It is well that he is so constituted , for if he were adventurous he would not be a safe conservator of credit . Let us weigh his counsel in order that we may wisely make haste slowly , but let us not wait too long upon his hesitant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need for rural credit legislation . Consider first the bald fact that dependable farmers in the West and South are paying 9.6 to 15.6 per cent , and distressed farmers 20 to 40 per cent for short-time operating credit , and land borrowers are paying 8 to 10.5 per cent for five-year loans with burdensome commissions for renewals . No industry can pay such rates and prosper . Farmers are not prospering except in rare cases of genius , or under methods of niggard selfdenial . The profits on agricultural lands in the last few years have consisted mainly of enhanced values due to increasing population and corresponding demands for farms . The cause for high-priced agricultural credit is twofold . First , and probably foremost , is inefficient and uneconomic farming . But at the worst that is not altogether the farmer 's fault . As a people , we have neglected the business of farming ; in our thinking we have put it to one side as a matter rather distinctively , if not exclusively , within the jurisdiction of Providence . The Department of Agriculture and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the science of agriculture , for increasing the yield of the land and combating plant and animal diseases , but little until very recently for the business of farming . To increase the yield may or may not be to increase the profit , for even in normal times a big crop usually sells for less gross money than a small crop , so that the more the farmers produce the less they receive . Without reciting experiences or piling up illustrations , it is sufficient to say that farming is rated as an unsafe or undesirable credit risk . Second ? and fully as consequential as inefficient farming ? are American conditions and habits which heretofore have made speculative adventures and industrial enterprises so enticing to investors and creditors . Railroading , mining , town-building , and high finance of one sort or another have absorbed the most of our available capital . Upon top of that the failure of a lot of wildcat land debenture companies in the late eighties gave a bad name to land loans . Money-lenders are just about as human as other folk . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unproved productive value , and , like sheep , they follow their bell-wethers in running away from the present rich pastures of proved productive value . Land loans are not in the fashion , and your custodian of trust funds is a man of scrupulous conventionality . This premise . must be accepted by every thinking man as true : Farming land is the source of all food and raiment ; it is the prime means of all human sustenance . By all the rules of economic philosophy it should be the safest basis of credit . Readers of rural credit literature have been told repeatedly that before the European war land loans in Germany commanded a lower rate of interest than Imperial Government bonds . The most eminent of the German rural economists three years ago gave me a reason , in words to this effect : " Governments sometimes fail ; they may be compelled to repudiate their debts . Land on the average of the years , under intelligent cultivation , will not fail , because nature never repudiates or wholly defaults . " How much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain that the European governments at the close of the war must repudiate in some degree , at least to the extent of a compulsory reduction of the interest charges they are now paying . Mr. Jacob Schiff says : " We bankers know that debentures based on farm mortgages can not be as readily sold as bonds of industrial concerns or bonds of railroads . " That is true at present , but it is a fact due to circumsfances , conditions , and habits , and not to economic truth , as the German economist 's philosophy plainly proves . The purpose of rural credit legislation is to institute a reform which will square credit practice with economic truth . This brings us to the crux of the whole matter , to the point of promise and the point of difficulty in American rural credit legislation . European land credit began a long time ago among the impoverished landowners who pledged their wasted farms severally and collectively for long-time loans to be paid on the amortization or sinking fund plan , like mu-tual or industrial bonds . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted in other European countries . The Raiffeisen rural bank , or short-time credit society , began later among the lowly peasants who grouped themselves together in a compact of unlimited liability on the principle of life insurance , as thus described by Leone Wollemborg , of Italy , whom I regard as the greatest of modern rural economists : Suppose you have before you one hundred small working farmers ; they all possess the qualities of honesty , industry , and labor capacity ; this is their only capital . Now , a capitalist having a hundred such men before him might with safety , under certain conditions , make them a loan of 50 francs each . The conditions with which the capitalist has to reckon are these : Of these one hundred men , some will certainly be afflicted with sickness , death , or lack of employment . It is a well-known fact that some of these men will certainly suffer from these causes , but it is impossible to say which man it will be ? whether the tenth , fiftieth , or hundredth man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual of the group will be incapacitated and thus rendered incapable of repaying his loan . But one thing is certain : it will not be the whole group ? only a certain proportion . Past experience indicates that out of one hundred two individuals are likely to be incapable of repaying their loan , while the others will be able to meet their obligations . Now , in order to meet the liability , the group must undertake to become responsible for the two members who are likely to be unable to pay ; they must become , in short , severally and collectively responsible for the total loan made to the group . There will thus be ninety-eight mein to repay the loan made to the one hundred . They will thus be able to assume responsibility for a loan of 49 francs each instead of 50 , for they will have to assume responsibility for the two per cent who will be unable to pay , and , by making themselves collectively responsible for the loan , they will be able to make it for 49 francs multiplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formula on which these banks are able to secure their capital is nothing more than an application of the same principle which governs insurance . Therefore this principle of unlimited liability is the first principle underlying the rural banks . Both systems were stimulated by Governmental aid in money , credit , or other favor , but they originated in the necessities and were wrought out in the thinking of the people most concerned . In this country we are by legislation anticipating , with the hope of averting or ameliorating , the dire distress which was , as it were , the birth-pangs of rural credit in Europe . To change the figure of speech , the European system was an evolution . We are endeavoring to fashion a system out of hand . The European land credit system was two hundred years in the making , the rural credit society some seventyfive ; we are trying to reach the same end in less time ? that is all . The danger is that we will neglect the important factor of education ; our people are habituated to individualism ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may work together as groups , with limited common liability , and yet retain their personal freedom of business conduct . The process will be slow and doubtless beset with much blundering , but I confidently believe we will make much faster progress than the Europeans made . The Federal Farm Loan Act is designed to establish standards of agricultural land value and to give deliberate official appraisal of land securities . It will economize the process of land-borrowing by bringing the borrower and the lender closer together . It will require the several States to revise , simplify , and standardize their land registration statutes . Most important of all , each borrower , in becoming a member of a local association in which he owns stock , becomes thereby a lender as well as a borrower . As a lender he will have a personal interest in making safe the loans of his association by seeing to it that the land is not appraised too highly , that the loan is used for productive and not for speculative purposes , and that the land behind the loan is conserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the borrower and the lender is clearly set forth by Wollemborg as follows : It is a well-known fact that public opinion is nearly always inclined to side with the weak as against the strong , and as , rightly or wrongly , the debtor is generally considered the weaker party , he usually has public opinion on his side . But in the case of the rural bank the situation is reversed . The heads of families in the village constitute the membership of the rural bank , and , as they are all interested in seeing that the loans for which they are severally and collectively responsible are paid , public opinion in this case is on the side of the creditor and not of the debtor.  |p514  If there are those who fear that : h Federal system will put private money-:coders and mortgage companies out of business , they are reminded that the total capitalization of the system will not exceed $9.000,000 ; the bond-issuing limit will be twenty times that , or $180.000,000 : outstanding farm mortgages in the United States amount to nearly $4,000.000.000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than set the pace for private capital to follow , as has been the case throughout Europe . Assuming that the States by State legislation will multiply such organized resources tenfold , there will remain ample opportunity for private initiative and enterprise . But , after all . is this a National problem ? Is its solution a Governmental duty ? In the sense that government is only a policeman , the answer is , No . " But I think we have got beyond that narrow conception . Farming is feeding and clothing the Nation . Surely that is a National concern . But to say that is to state only a small part of the problem . It is sociological and political as well as economic . Thirty-seven per cent of the American farmers are tenants ; in my State , Texas , the percentage is more than fifty , and I think the percentage is as much in several of the Western States . Between 1900 and 1910 the ratio of tenants to farm-owners increased sixteen per cent . Presently the farmowners will be a minority . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are there fears of Socialism ? Of communism ? Of revolution in property rights ? Let us beware of a majority of voters who despair of acquiring homes or who have lost the homestead sentiment . I could name States with a preponderating industrial population congested in seething centers . I could name countries where landlordism and tenantry evolve aristocracy and serfdom . To name either is but to recall civil strife or political desperadoism or both . It is sheer conceit for us to assume that we can defy the teachings of history and the passions of human kind . Friction kindles fire ; discontent foments upheaval . The farmers know that they are creating most of the Nation 's wealth ; they are accumulating but little of it . However much of the fault may be theirs . much of it is due to the neglect of the body politic and the body economic , to the mass of us who have given no proper thought to the means whereby we live , but have pursued our toll-taking ways by taking as much as we could and giving only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prosperity without fairly considering the sweat or the wage of the man who treads the winepress alone . There is in this observation nothing of the delusion of making men prosperous by law or of creating security values by fiat of government . The poor and the ; andless we will have with us always , but when it comes to the point that the average man of industry can not prosper it is time for the Nation to study the portents . Show me a ' prosperous farm-owner , and I will show you a thought ful , patriotic citizen who will cheerfully give his time , his talents , and his life , as occasion may require , for his country and its free institutions . Show me a despairing tenantry ; and I will show you a powder magazine inviting explosion by any spark of agitation that may fly from the forge of hammering industry . The period of the Republic 's greatest achievements in social welfare , in general comfort , in sane statesmanship , in spiritual elevation , in genuine culture ? in all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a majority of our people were homeowning and prosperous country folk . The American farmer was then a country gentleman , from whose loins came our greatest statesmen , warriors , philosophers , preachers , and poets . The farmer nowadays is derided as a " jay " or cajoled as a simpleton . As we speak in the language of the street and the newspaper paragraph , so we think in our hearts . To a considerable degree we cause things to be what we think them to be . It is time to face about , to begin thinking of farming as man 's earliest , and noblest vocation , and of the country as the garden which the Lord commanded Adam to " keep and to dress , " which may be properly interpreted as to conserve and to beautify . Thus we may cause it again to become what it should be , what it was ordained to be -- man 's natural abiding-place and ' the means of sustenance to which cities in their proper relation are only market-places for the exchange of commodities , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the useful servants . But sentimentalizing will not work the reform . Rhapsodizing will not materialize its blessings . Country life will revive when we make agriculture pay .
