txt The Swedish Iron and Steel Company of New York and New Orleans is determined to discover the identity of two men who have been swindling manufacturers by using its name to obtain orders , and then raising the ' orders by one means or another George Parsly Toby has been making a secret investigation of these operations , and is anxious to get definite information of the swindlers from their victims , some of whom seem reluctant to admit that they have been swindled . With this in vie* the steel company will send out circulars to-day all over the country of which this is a copy : ; 5,000 REWARD . For evidence that will convict the parties who have been selling steel throughout the country , using the name of the undersigned without our authority . Their methods vary , but one is to solicit orders for small quantities of samples , then dlctate to some assistant of the purchaser an order on the purchaser 's forms for a large quantity , and by various methods to induce the purchaser to sign without careful examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . we ask full particulars of those who may have been victimized . SWEDISH IRON AND STEEL COMPANY . 12 Platt Street . New York , N. Y. : 42S Race Street , New Orleans , La . The investigation disclosed that crooked transactions aggregating at least $500,000 had been perpetrated in the steel trade in the last seven years . For about five Years the scheme was worked intermittently by two Frenchmen , operating in the names of French companies . The recent activities have been in the names of domestic companies , and whether they emanate from the same sources or are the work of imitators is a matter of conjecture . The Frenchmen represented themselves as a Count and his secretary . The Count was seeing the country , and as his father was President of a big French steel company he naturally interested himself in factories here . He admired the ingenuity of American manufacturers , but candor compelled hint to say that the quality of American steel was unequal to the gest French product . This led up to an offer to have a sample of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bookkeeping it was necessary to have a formal order . The order was given for a small quantity . Subsequently a much larger shipment of steel , usually of inferior grade , was delivered through some jobber . The jobber hod the order in writing for the amount delivered , and there was nothing for the manufacturer to do but pay fur le As a rule , when he saw how he had been victimized , he also decided to say nothing , about the transaction ' : The orders were raised in various ways . If it called for a certain number of bars , those delivered were eighteen feet in length and built in proportion , instead of eighteen inches , as the manufacturer expected . As the dimensions were not specified in the order , no exception could be taken to it . In another case similar to the one reported to the Swedish iron and Steel Company , the Count dictated the order to one of the factory 's stenographers , and engaged the purchasing agent in conversation while he perfunctorily signed it without reading it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Swedish Iron and Steel Company by the receipt of this letter , under date of July 18 , 1911 : Gentlemen : We wired you to-day as follows : - On account of mistake in our order given your Mr. ? yesterday cancel entire order , " which we now confirm . Mr. ? , in company with his brother , called on us yesterday as your representatives , soliciting orders for steel . Our Superintendent dictated a sample order to them as follows : " One bar three-eighths of an Inch , one bar half an inch , one bar three-quarters of an inch . and one bar seven-eighths of an inch , " which Mr. ? presumably entered in his book . Mr. afterward said Ile preferred to hare the order on our letterhead . While his brother was ' , discussing the remarkable quality of the steel with our Superintendent Mr. ? had a young man in our Superintendent 's office copy the order on our letterhead as follows : Three bars each , size 12 to 35 feet long of inch .

' How on earth Mr. ? made the mistake of making our order as given by our Superintendent for about forty pounds of steel into an order of nearly a ton is something we can not understand . It was not noticed until the gentlemen had left , and we were unable to locate them . The victims chosen were always of first financial rating . Sometimes they used only small quantities of steel in machine shops that were merely adjuncts to their business . Their names include candymakers , furniture firms , automobile manufacturers , weavers and spinners , mining companies , the tool trade , machine shops and countless others In New England , ( especially Providence , R.
