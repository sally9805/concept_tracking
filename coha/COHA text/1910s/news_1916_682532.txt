txt Th , plans of the Democratic leaders went all agley today . The Republican appropriation Chicago of the American flag and the Americanism issue had been viewed with resentment and some alarm , and it had been determined to meet the attempted abduction of the Stars and Stripes by outdoing the Republicans , by making Americanism the keynote of the Democratic Convention front start to finish , by so emphasizing it in every act and utterance that the Republicans would be forced to the defensive . The order went forth that the demonstrations must all hinge on this , that everyspeech must hang around it , that e'en the band must subordinate " and the other favorite Democratic songs to the national songs , that there be terrific outbursts of spontaneous thusiasm at every step and universal singing every time , the band played . The convention did burst out into spontaneous and electrifying enthusiasm at its opening session , but it was over the Question of peace .

His line of argument was totally unexpected ; the convention was not looking for any such thing , and it went into a frenzy . Whenever he attempted to drop the subject and go on to something else it would stop him and yell that he must give it more of that . Sometimes when he had made an ' especially able rhetorical demonstration that there were many cases in which a nation might well be too pruud to fight , it would make him go back and repeat . the sentence , even the whole paragraph , and often it would chant his own pet sentences back at him in a delirium of delight . Whenever he got back to Americanism , on which all the great applause of the convention was intended to hang , the convention lost all its ardor and gave him the dull , perfunc , ory , mechanical clapping of listless hands be -- fore apathetic faces for the required number of minutes . Convention Greedy for More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the leaders , and they were stupefied . It was one of the most dramatic scenes in the history of national conventions . Glynn himself was tally unprepared for it , so much so that he had intended to omit large parts of this section of his speech , thinking it would be uninteresting to hear and ' could as well be left tor perusal in the newspapers . The convention detected his , intention and forced him by yelling and shouting to give them the parts he wastrying to glide over . William J. Bryan , as a newspaper correspondent in the press stand , wept - with , emotion as Glynn pictured the victories ' of peace , but he laughed with the crowd when a Texas delegate , interrupting Glynn , leaped to his chair and cried : : " And do n't forget that policy also is satisfactory to William Jenninisi Bryan !

On the Other hand , whenever h ? . struck the note of Americanisni his disl : conifiture over the flat , dry , mechanicak response was . plain . The plans which went so wrong wore those of President Wilson himself . The must careful preparation had been made The plan was for a great dernonstra ; tion , the start of which was to be tile singing of " The Star-Spangled Ban-i ; tier by the convention and the audience . Tomorrow the some thing was . to be repeated with " The Red , White , and Blue , " and next day with soinOi other national air . Printed copies , a " The Star-Spangled Banner " were clisi ; tributed throughout the convention for the purpose . Every mention of Amer- : ica or of the flat ; was to cc greeted with cheers , and in case the convention was slow to remember its duty at any of . these times Sergeant at arms John . J ; Martin was to stand behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor Glynn 's speech had been re- ' vised and re-revised and he had ranged to leave out all the parts whiell did not relate to the question of AMeri , canistn , and merely have them printed . ac part of the speech . He did leaveiouti , a:I except the citation of precedent:1 ; ln which the ' United States had endiired Provocations to war , and those he was not permitted to leave out : the convention compelled him to go on with them . The singing of " The Star , Spangled Banner " was a routine affair , without life , the mention of America was received with dutiful applause at every point , the magic name of the President himself called forth only a manufactured and souleless demonstration , and the great unscheduled outburst of joy was over the subject of peace under provocation . Delight and Astonishment . The behavior of the convention when Glynn gave it , unexpectedly to it and himself , its chance to cheer , vas compounded of delight and astonishment . The impression created by it was that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that they were not sure this was a heroic attitude . When Mr. Glynn told them that not only was it true Americanism to bear with provocation and settle disputes without war , - but that it had been the almost invariable policy of our Government throughout its whole existence , the effect was simply electric . He identified in their own minds the cause of pacifism with that of Americanism , and made the two identical . It was probably the first time in the ? history of conventions that one of them ever . became frantic with joy over a mere recital of diplomatic precedents . the effect of which the orator himself doubted so seriously that he intended to skip over them . It was certainly the , first time that a convention which had not only been ordered to cheer for one , Issue , but really intended to do so , changed its mind in the course of a temporary Chairman 's speech and cheered instead for another . Whatever " Americanism " may mean , it got no cheers except made-to-order cheers ; . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which squinted , however slightly . in the direction of pacifism . The argument of Chairman Glynn , so far as that part which brought about the demonstration is concerned , was that disputes with other nations should be settled by negotiation instead of War , and that this was the historic and almost unbroken policy of the United States . Save where the liberties , the territory , or the substantial rights of the United States are invaded and assaulted . " he said , " it is the duty of this nation to avoid war by every honorable means . The policy of neutrality is as truly American as the American flag . Where is the American hardy enough to challenge a policy so firmly fixed in the nation 's traditions ? " He declared that Washington refusing to go to war in the last years of his administration was a more inspiring figure than Washington crossing the Delaware or Washington receiving Cornwall 's sword at Yorktown . Peace Better Than Slaughter . " Wealth has come to us , " he said . " power has come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintained for ourselves and for our children a nation dedicated to the ideals of peace . rather than to the gospel of selfishness and slaughter. ? ? He told how the Spaniards had shot the crew of the Virginius. but we had not gene to war over it ; how the Chileans had killed and wounded seventeen of our sailors , but without ? a resulting war : how foreign countries had violated our rights in the civil war ; how Confederate sympathizers from Canada hart raided Vermont : how the Alabama had been let loose upon our commerce , all without war . This was the joint at which he intended to slide over what he imagined would he a dull and uninteresting recital of bare facts . lie started to say so . and instantly the entire convention , which had been hanging on his words With an expression of mingled delight and amazement at his historic proofs that it was really on the patriotic sine . rose spontaneously to its feet , shouting tempestuously : " No , no : Go on : Give us more . more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " At first Glynn seemed to think this was a mere compliment . and a deprecating smile appeared on his face . but as he began to realize that it was in intense earnest . the smile disappeared and he stood there with his eyebrows going up and down and his face fixed in a look of astonishment and perplex:ty . At last he grasped the situation . readjusted his ideas and made a signal that he would yield to their wishes . But the crowd was alert for any future attempt to put in asterisks. and whenever Glynn aroused its suspicions that he was about to do SO the same scene was repeated . Cites More Precedents . He went on to how that in Pierce 's administration Great Fnatain violated our neutrality , but that there was no war ; that when Van Buren was Presidept . Canadians attacked an American ship , killed some of her crew , and sent her adrift over Niagara Falls . all without war . Each of these instances was rapturously eheered. as all the other instances of our peacefulness under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case in which the British ship Leopard fired upon the chesapea ke , killed several of her sailors , and took three American citizens off the ships and hanged one of them In Halifax . This is the case to wli ? h Arnerfean histories refer as the supreme evidence of American weakness and many of them describe as cowardice , and Mr. Glynn approached that case with evident misgiving , as if he were not quite sure how a reference to it might be received : It was received with a great roar of cheers . What did we do ' ! " yelled delegates from all over the hail , and It was taken up in an exultant . joyous chant , " What did we do ' : What did we do ? " " We did n't go to war , " answered Glynn , and there was another roar of joy . Men jumped up in their seats and danced about the aisles and waved American flags , shout ing like F , honlboys and screaming like steam sirens . If Mr. Glynn had any doubts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smile of contentment , no longer mixed with that puzzled expression it had worn at the first outburst , and he went on with confidence to the time when France had " extended her seizures . searches . and confiscations to the very waters of the l'nited States themselves . " and there was another Whoop of delieht . But that was not all . He beat the applause down with his hand to show that he was not through . and went on : " American Ambassadors who sought to adjust these wrongs were refused recognition and openly insulted at tile r2ench Court . " " What Did We Dot What Did We Dot " " ' What did we do ? " came the yell again . and again the chant began around the hall . ? ? What did we do ? What did We do ? " We jild not go to war , " answered the Chairman , and again the American flags waved madly over the heads of the cheering delegates half mad with joy On he went , telling how in Washing- ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea . how American crews and passengers sere thrown into prison and deprived of legal rights . He told how Genet " fitted out privateers jp our harbors and flouted our officials . ' lie told how " up in Qtfebec Lord Dorchester promised Canadian Indians the pleasure of burnisig American homes and scalping American citizens . " And around the hall went ringing the shout , " What did we do ? What did we do ? " And the same uproarious ha . gri of approval greeted Glynn 's inv &Fiable; answer , " We did n't go to " Are they willing . " he cried . " to brand Grant as a coward because he kept us at peace with Spain* : " And again the big hall trembled with shouts and stamping feet . The stone which the builders had rejected had become the head of the corner . The part of his speech which Glynn and the leaders regarded so lightly that he and they had intended to omit all but a few paragraphs of it had taken the convention by storm . The eloquence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which had been the subject of so many conferences and revisions had produced only polite applause ; what had set the convention mad was a plain , matter-offact recital of dry precedents from our diplomatic history , such as most convention orators omit from their speeches if they can because they are expected to have a. deadening and dampening effect . A Henson for Their Faith . But there was no mystery about it to those who watched the faces of the delegates . What was going on In their Minds was as easily read as if it had been printed . When Glynn first began to deal with the historic instances there was an expression of dawning bewilderment , which speedily changed to half-incredulous joy and then to raptitre , ? It was plain to.see that they had been supplied with a reason for their faith . Pacifism has been jeered at . made to seem in opposition to Americanism , until they had come to feel almost apologetic about it . Now they weretold that they had been right all the time , that one could be patriotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to submit to great provocation and historically un-American to go to war over it : and they could not contain themselves . " What did we do ? " was born on the instant  --  the jubilant and unterrified war cry of a hitherto none-too-jubiliant and just-as-littleterrified party . Tried to Check the Stampede . The situation by this time had thrown the leaders into utter dismay . Those who had labored hardest to keynote Americanism and had succeeded found their work crumbling away and vanishing before the stampede of pacifism . Senator John Walter Smith of Maryland came running up on the platform in the wildest agitation and concern and held a conference with Chairman McCombs of the National Committee . He declared that something must be done to check the stampede , or , if that could not be done , at least to have something said that would mitigate the effect of it and remove the impression that the Democrats were anxious not only for peace , but for peace at any price . Chairman McCombs was himself of the same opinion and just as much worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glynn had fixed the position of the Democratic Party irrevocably as a party too proud to ' fight . McCombs wrote on a sheet of paper the words : " But we are willing to fight if necessary. - He signed his name to it and passed it over to Glynn , who was standing waiting for the delirium to subside . Glynn read it , nodded and called back . " I 'll take care of that . " So McCotnbs and Smith expected him to say something that would put the party right , that would moderate or mitigate to some extent at least , the effect of that pacifist stampede . But Glynn never fulfilled his promise and went on to rouse the paficists to wilder and wilder flights of frenzy . Sometimes . when he finished some sentence that particularly struck their fancy , they would yell , " Say it again , say it again ! " Glynn would repeat it , and they would cheer again . One such sentence he had to repeat three times . Mr. Glynn went on to argue that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a definition of his own , which again supplied the delegates with cause for a burst of joy . He defined national honor as " the composite sentiment , the composite reason of a whole people , feeling the emotions of nature and following the dictates of God. - And again the delegates , supplied with a patriotic reason for pacifism , shouted with gladness . The speaker attacked the opponents of the Democracy . " They proceed , " he cried , " on the theory that the noisest man in the land is the best patriot . " Would n't Name Roosevelt , " Name him , name him : ? ? shouted the convention , and there was a cataclysmic yell that stopped the proceedings for a few moments . All over the hall men were on their feet with their mouths open , waiting for a shout of scorn when he should utter the name of Roosevelt . But the ex-Governor did not care to thaw the contrast any plainer than he had made It . He deliberated for a moment , smiled , shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they stop short of pressing a point too far in the witness boxes . " Fearful within , blustering witnout . " Mr. Glynn went on , " the coward whistle 's to keep up courage and hopes the world will read in his face what was not in his heart . " With this the convention had to he content , though there were still shouts of " Name him ! ? ' The chairman went on to declare . amid scenes hike those that had gone before , that " the genius of this country is for peace , " and that " we have built our greatness on the resources of nature and the peaceful toil of our people . The ring of the anvil , not the rattle of the sabre . " he said , " the song of the reaper . not the shock of the soldier . the clatter of the shuttle . not the crack of the rifle , have won us the place we occupy today in the councils of the world . " No Fervor for Preparedness . Sentiments like these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now t , lynti had to approach the subject of preparedness . He said that " we have been carried too close to the rocks of war during the past two years to believe that those rocks do not ? xist. " and he briefly and sketchily deu it with the subject . praising the Administration for what It hart donr- t ? 1 prepare us for defense . The moment he tackled this subject the mond of exaltation was gone , gone the tumult . What he had to say in favor of pa redness was applauded , but with none of the fervor that had turned the eonvention into a human storm while he was talking about pacifism . The speaker cut remorselessly and without protest from the delegates those parts of his speech dealing with the tariff and other subjects unrelated to the dominant topic of the hour . He left nut nearly the whole of that part dealing with the tariff . which may he read in the printed speech , hut was not spoken . There were no mere shouts of " Go on , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The enthusiasm oozed steadily away . Mr. Glynn hurried en to the name of ti ilson. hoping to revive it . When he began to eulogize the President there was applause . hut it was of the perfunctory. cut-and-dried order . He employed all the tricks of voice and manner known to the experienced orator . and brought out Wilson 's name at last at the top of his voice . Demonstration Short-Lived , But the cheer for it was brief and casual . It began at 2:30 ; at 2:al there was a dead silence , not a voice being raised . Officially the " demonstration " was still nn , for the Chair made no effort to proceed with business ; bra the noise was all that of persons moving about the floor and taiking to each other . The hand was signaled , and it burst forth In a medley of patriotic airs ? " Yankee Doodle . " " The Red . White . and Blue . " and others . This brought forth a few cheers . Processions of delegates ambled through the aisles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . A number whistled the airs as an accompaniment to the band . There was no other noise . At : 1:34 the Chair stopped the " demonstration . " President Wilson 's Flag Day proclamation was then produced and read . This was in line with the program to make Americanism the keynote of the day and was expected to produce a demonstration , but it produced none . It was listened to in dead silence and there were only a few handclaps at its close . Mr. Glynn lihnself , standing on the platform in full view of the crowd , tried . to lead the applause , but hardly any one followed him . While the reading was going on . a band outside the hall Was playing " Rally ' Round the Flag , " and the music mixed with the steady sound of the reading clerk 's voice telling off the President 's sentences . Then there was some routine business of no consequence , and the first session of the convention adjourned to meet tomorrow at Ii o'clock .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
