txt FULL CREW LAW CONDEMNED . Absurd to Require Extra Men on " Light " Engines . There were , and still are , many objections to the full crew law recently put into effect . Of all the burdensome provisions , however , the most asinine is the one requiring even a " light " engine to carry a conductor and brakeman . " Light " engines run under definite orders . If it becomes necessary to change the latter . it is a very simple matter to have the nearest operator flag them . Under such conditions it must be obvious that the two extra men have nothing to do but view the scenery and get In the way of the engineer and fireman . The amount of space in the cab of even it very large locomotive is necessarily limited , and it is a serious mistake to pack it with useless men . Comment on this situation may he acrimonious or humorous , according to cne 's mood . I can not refrain , however , from suggesting the advisabilty of adding an expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve a glass of champagne to the fireman between " scoops " of coal . I have entertained high regard and respect for railroad men from childhood , and would not attempt to be waggish on an occasion like this but for tho , reason that the full crew law is fraught with grotesque absurdities .
