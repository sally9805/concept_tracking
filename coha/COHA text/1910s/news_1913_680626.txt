txt With a smiling manner that changed to occasional bursts of hearty laughter at his own desperate expedients , David Lamar , the New York stock broker who is known in Wall Street as " The Wolf , " told the Senate Lobby Committee to-day that in an effort to rehabilitate Edward Lauterbach with the Morgan group and the Union Pacific officials , he had impersonated a half score of public men in telephone conversations with the financial leaden : of New York , He admitted that as Representative Daniel J. Riordan of New York he hr called up Judge Robert S. Lovett , Chair man of the Executive Committee of the Union Pacific ; Maxwell Evarts , couns. for Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. , and John D ' - Archbold of the Standard Oil . As Rep , resentative A. Mitchell Palmer of Pennsylvania he frequently had called up Lewis Cass Ledyard and promised the co-operation or threatened the hostility of Speaker Clark , Chairman Underwood , and Senator Stone of Missouri . He said he had warned Mr. Strooks of the United Cigar Stores that unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progressive tax on tobacco production would be imposed upon tobacco sales . Finally in what he called a fit of " malicious mischief " he called up Charles D. Hilles , Chairman of the Republican National Committee , and under the name of W. F. McCombs , Chairman of the Democratic National Committee , begged Mr. Hilles to help him straighten out the tangle in tile Democratic ranks in Washington . Those threats and promises made under various names Mr. Lamar characterized as " all rot , " and members of the committee generally expressed the opin , ion that - his declarations reflected on nobody except himself . But disclosures of a more serious sort were made regarding Edward Lauterbach 's active participation in all this . while Mr. Lamar reluctantly admitted under oath that he had first threatened and finally drafted the resolution that resulted in the Stanley investigation of the Steel Trust . The draft , he said , he had handed to Henry D. Martin , Secretary of the Anti-Trust League , and that Mr. Martin gave it to Mr. Stanley of Kentucky , who introduced it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a result of these disclosures the committee promptly directed Mr. Martin to appear to-morrow to explain his part in tile matter . At the same time Edward Lauterbach , who swore that he was in complete ignorance of the efforts being made in his behalf , will be con , fronted with inadvertent admissions by Lamar and by the sworn testimony of Mr. Ledyard to the effect that Mr. Lauterbach not only was cognizant of the efforts being made in his behalf , but had himself offered to prominent New York financiers the co-operation of Speaker Clark through the intermediation of Senator Stone . and nearly every other Democrat of prominence in Washington . One of the sensational incidents of a day that was crowded with chapters that would have fitted into any romance sufficiently lurid came when Mr. Lamar , without any preliminary transition , charged that in 1901 the Union Pacific assets had been forged " to the tune of $82,000,000 " and that these fraudulent assets had been used in making the great fottunes of E. H. Harriman , Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performed by the President of the board or the office boy , " he did not know which , but it had consisted in simply erasing from the debit side an entry of ** offsetting a similar entry on the credit side . Mr. Lamar 's vivid account of this transaction , which he said he had learned first front Thomas Gibson , a New York economic analysist , called for the strongest language of the day . Paul D. Crava th , who , with Mr. Ledyard and Mr. Evarts , listened to ail Mr. Lamar had to say , followed him on the witness stand and begged to make a statement . He swore that for a week or more Union Pacific officials had heard that Lamar was trying to obtain the publication of a " hear " article referring to the alleged forgery . The fraudulent nature of the story was so palpable , he said , that the newspapers would not print it , and that Lamar had then told his friends that he would soon tell the story in such a way that the newspapers would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " way " he meant . All of Mr. Lamar 's testimony , said Mr. Cravath , was a confession that Lamar was the most unconscionable of liars , and his statements concerning the Union Pacific were no exception . Next to the spectacular statements of Lamar , - which he gave with the air of one recounting the proud moments in his life , one of the most interesting features of to-daws testimony was that tending to supply a motive for the gigantic conspiracy centring around Mr. Lauterbach and Mr. Lamar . Stack Market Scheme . Senator Cummins of the Investigation Committee always has expressed the belief that the whole thing , instead of being for the insignificant purpose of rehabilitating Edward Lauterbach or getting a fee for him , was part of a great stock market Manipulating- scheme . To-day his suspicions got much tangible support . Judge Lovett , when he testified , said that it had not occurred to him to believe a stock jobbing scheme was on foot , and Mr. Lamar to-day swore that he had been actuated by the most disinterested motives . Of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one sort that hurt him . That was the sir , - geslion bluntly put by Mr. Ledyard that the whole conspiracy was a piece of childish foolery . Nobody could have thought , he said , that a Congressman was- making the preposterous offers made by Mr. Lamar under the name of , various Congressmen . Mr. Lamar seemed to wilt under this aspersion ' and did not regain his composure until another reference was made to his audatity . Hint of Prison Scared ? Him . At times , too , in spite of the debonaire attitude he assumed , Mr. Lamar plainly was frightened . References to the penitentiary made him momentarily serious , though New York lawyers agreed that SO ' far he seemed to have kept himself outside the reach of the law . His alarm was visible when Senator Stone , whose name he . had used so often as Speaker Clark 's intermediary with the capitalists of NewYork , stalked into the room to demand information as to exactly how his name had been brought in . Mr. Lamar seemed relieved when the committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feelings by saying that nobody believed that he had been inculpated in the lcast.
