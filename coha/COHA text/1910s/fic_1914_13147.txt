The stage represents a studio , used as living and dining room in an upper story , Washington Square South . Through an immense north window in the back wall appear tree tops and the upper part of the Washington Arch . Beyond it you look up Fifth Avenue . There are rugs , bookcases , a divan . Near the window is a big table , loaded at one end with serious-looking books and austere scientific periodicals . At the other end are architects drawings , blue prints , dividing compasses , square , ruler , etc . There is a door in each side wall . Near the one to the spectator 's right stands a costumer with hats and coats masculine and feminine . There is a breakfast table set for three but only two seated at it  --  namely Henrietta and Stephen Brewster . As the curtains withdrawn Steve pushes back his coffee cup and sits dejected . HENRIETTA It is n't the coffee , Steve dear . There 's nothing the matter with the coffee . There 's something the matter with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter with my stomach . HENRIETTA ( Scornfully . ) Your stomach ! The trouble is not with your stomach but in your sub-conscious mind . p. 3 STEPHEN Subconscious piffle ! ( Takes morning paper and tries to read . ) HENRIETTA Steve , you never used to be so disagreeable . You certainly have got some sort of a complex . You 're all inhibited . You 're no longer open to new ideas . You wo n't listen to a word about psychoanalysis . STEPHEN A word ! I 've listened to volumes ! HENRIETTA You 've ceased to be creative in architecture  --  your work is n't going well . You 're not sleeping well  --  STEPHEN How can I sleep , Henrietta , when you 're always waking me up in the night to find out what I 'm dreaming ? HENRIETTA But dreams are so important , Steve . STEPHEN There 's nothing wrong with me . HENRIETTA You do n't even talk as well as you used to . STEPHEN Talk ? I ca n't say a thing without you looking at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trail of a complex . HENRIETTA This very irritability indicates that you 're suffering from some suppressed desire . STEPHEN I 'm suffering from a suppressed desire for a little peace . p. 4 HENRIETTA Dr. Russell is doing simply wonderful things with nervous cases . Wo n't you go to him , Steve ? STEPHEN ( Slamming down his newspaper . ) No , Henrietta , I wo n't ! HENRIETTA But , Stephen  --  ! STEPHEN Tst ! I hear Mabel coming . Let 's not be at each other 's throats the first day of her visit . ( He takes out cigarettes . ) ( Enter Mabel from door left , the side opposite Steve , so that he is facing her .  --  She is wearing a rather fussy negligee and breakfast cap in contrast to Henrietta who wears " radical " clothes . Mabel is what is called plump . MABEL Good morning . HENRIETTA Oh , here you are , little sister . STEPHEN Good morning , Mabel . ( Mabel nods to him and turns , her face lighting up , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she leans against her . ) It 's so good to have you here . MABEL It 's so good to be here  --  with you . HENRIETTA I was going to let you sleep , thinking you 'd be tired after the long trip . Sit down . There 'll be fresh toast in a few minutes and ( rising from her chair ) will you have  --  p. 5 MABEL Oh , I ought to have told you , Henrietta . Do n't get anything for me . I 'm not eating any breakfast . HENRIETTA ( At first in mere surprise . ) Not eating breakfast ? ( She sits down , then leans toward Mabel and scrutinizes her . ) STEPHEN ( Half to himself . ) The psychoanalytical look ! HENRIETTA Mabel , why are you not eating any breakfast ? MABEL ( A little startled . ) Why , no particular reason . I just do n't care much for breakfast , and they say it keeps down  --  that is , it 's a good thing to go without it . HENRIETTA Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MABEL Oh , yes , I slept all right . Yes , I slept fine last night , only ( laughing ) I did have the funniest dream ! STEPHEN S  --  h ! S  --  t ! HENRIETTA ( Moving closer . ) And what did you dream , Mabel ? STEPHEN Look-a-here , Mabel , I feel it 's my duty to put you on . Do n't tell Henrietta your dreams . If you do she 'll find out that you have an underground desire to kill your father and marry your mother . p. 6 HENRIETTA Do n't be absurd , Stephen Brewster . ( Sweetly to Mabel . ) What was your dream , dear ? MABEL ( Laughing . ) Well , I dreamed I was a hen . HENRIETTA A hen ? STEPHEN ( Solemnly . ) A hen . MABEL Yes ; and I was pushing along through a crowd as fast as I could , but being a hen I could n't walk very fast  --  it was like having a tight skirt , you know ; and there was some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how mixed up dreams are  --  and it kept shouting after me and saying , " Step , Hen ! Step , Hen ! " until I got all excited and just could n't move at all . HENRIETTA ( Resting chin in palm and peering . ) You say you became much excited ? MABEL ( Laughing . ) Oh , yes ; I was in a terrible state . HENRIETTA ( Leaning back , murmurs . ) This is significant . STEPHEN She dreams she 's a hen . She is told to step lively . She becomes violently agitated . What can it mean ? p. 7 HENRIETTA ( Turning impatiently from him . ) Mabel , do you know anything about psychoanalysis ? MABEL ( Feebly . ) Oh  --  not much . No  --  I  --  ( brightening . ) It 's something about the war , is n't it ? STEPHEN Not that kind of war . MABEL ( Abashed . ) I thought it might be the name of a new explosive . STEPHEN It is . MABEL ( Apologetically to Henrietta , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  we do not live in touch with intellectual things , as you do . Bob being a dentist  --  somehow  --  our friends  --  STEPHEN ( Softly . ) Oh , to be a dentist ! ( Goes to window and stands looking out . ) HENRIETTA Do n't you ever see anything more of that editorial writer  --  what was his name ? MABEL Lyman Eggleston ? HENRIETTA Yes , Eggleston . He was in touch with things . Do n't you see him ? p. 8 MABEL Yes , I see him once in a while . Bob does n't like him very well . HENRIETTA Your husband does not like Lyman Eggleston ? ( Mysteriously . ) Mabel , are you perfectly happy with your husband ? STEPHEN ( Sharply . ) Oh , come now , Henrietta  --  that 's going a little strong ! HENRIETTA Are you perfectly happy with him , Mabel ? ( Steve goes to work-table . ) MABEL Why  --  yes  --  I guess so . Why  --  of course I am ! HENRIETTA Are you happy ? Or do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ought to be ? MABEL Why , Henrietta , I do n't know what you mean ! STEPHEN ( Seizes stack of books and magazines and dumps them on the breakfast table . ) This is what she means , Mabel . Psychoanalysis . My work-table groans with it . Books by Freud , the new Messiah ; books by Jung , the new St. Paul ; the Psycho-analytical Review  --  back numbers two-fifty per . MABEL But what is it all about ? p. 9 STEPHEN All about your sub , un , non-conscious mind and desires you know not of . They may be doing you a great deal of harm . You may go crazy with them . Oh , yes ! People are doing it right and left . Your dreaming you 're a hen  --  ( Shakes his head darkly . ) MABEL ( Hastily , to avert a quarrel . ) But what do you say it is , Henrietta ? STEPHEN ( Looking at his watch . ) Oh , if Henrietta 's going to start that ! ( He goes to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sharpens a lead-pencil . ) HENRIETTA It 's like this , Mabel . You want something . You think you ca n't have it . You think it 's wrong . So you try to think you do n't want it . Your mind protects you  --  avoids pain  --  by refusing to think the forbidden thing . But it 's there just the same . It stays there shut up in your unconscious mind , and it festers . STEPHEN Sort of an ingrowing mental toenail . HENRIETTA Precisely . The forbidden impulse is there full of energy which has simply got to do something . It breaks into your consciousness in disguise , masks itself in dreams , makes all sorts of trouble . In extreme cases it drives you insane . p. 10 MABEL ( With a gesture of horror . ) Oh ! HENRIETTA ( Reassuring . ) But psychoanalysis has found out how to save us from that . It removes the obstruction , brings into consciousness the suppressed desire that was making all the trouble . In a word psychoanalysis is simply the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From his table . ) It is also the latest scientific method of separating families . HENRIETTA ( Mildly . ) Families that ought to be separated . STEPHEN The Dwights , for instance . You must have met them , Mabel , when you were here before . Helen was living , apparently , in peace and happiness with good old Joe . Well  --  she went to this psychoanalyzer she was " psyched , " and biff !  --  bang !  --  Home she comes with an unsuppressed desire to leave her husband . ( He starts work , drawing lines on a drawing board with a T-square . ) MABEL How terrible ! Yes , I remember Helen Dwight . But  --  but did she have such a desire ? STEPHEN First she 'd known of it . p. 11 MABEL And she left him ? HENRIETTA ( Coolly . ) Yes , she did . MABEL Was n't he good to her ? HENRIETTA Why yes , good enough . MABEL Was n't he kind to her ? HENRIETTA Oh , yes  --  kind to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HENRIETTA Oh , Mabel ! Left her good , kind husband ! How naive  --  forgive me , dear , but how bourgeoise you are ! She came to know herself . And she had the courage ! ! MABEL I may be very naive and  --  bourgeoise  --  but I do n't see the good of a new science that breaks up homes . ( Steve clasps hands , applauding . ) STEPHEN In enlightening Mabel , we must n't neglect to mention the case of Art Holden 's private secretary , Mary Snow , who has just been informed of her suppressed desire for her employer . MABEL Why , I think it is terrible , Henrietta ! It would be better if we did n't know such things about ourselves . p. 12 HENRIETTA No , Mabel , that is the old way . MABEL But  --  but her employer ? Is he married ? STEPHEN ( Grunts . ) Wife and four children . MABEL Well , then , what good does it do the girl to be told she has a desire for him ? There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old institutions will have to be reshaped so that something can be done in such cases . It happens , Mabel , that this suppressed desire was on the point of landing Mary Snow in the insane asylum . Are you so tight-minded that you 'd rather have her in the insane asylum than break the conventions ? MABEL But  --  but have people always had these awful suppressed desires ? HENRIETTA Always . STEPHEN But they 've just been discovered . HENRIETTA The harm they do has just been discovered . And free , sane people must face the fact that they have to be dealt with . MABEL ( Stoutly . ) I do n't believe they have them in Chicago . HENRIETTA ( Business of giving Mabel up . ) People " have them " wherever the living Libido  --  the center of the soul 's energy  --  is in conflict with petrified moral codes . That means everywhere in civilization . Psychoanalysis  --  p. 13 STEPHEN Good God ! I 've got the roof in the cellar ! ( Holds plan at arm 's length . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychoanalysis could undo . ( To Mabel . ) Is it any wonder I 'm concerned about Steve ? He dreamed the other night that the walls of his room melted away and he found himself alone in a forest . Do n't you see how significant it is for an architect to have walls slip away from him like that ? It symbolizes his loss of grip in his work . There 's some suppressed desire  --  STEPHEN ( Hurling his ruined plan viciously to the floor . ) Suppressed hell ! HENRIETTA You speak more truly than you know . It is through suppressions that hells are formed in us . MABEL ( Looking at Steve , who is tearing his hair . ) Do n't you think it would be a good thing , Henrietta , if we went somewhere else ? ( They rise and begin to pick up the dishes . Mabel drops a plate which breaks . Henrietta draws up short and looks at her  --  the psychoanalytic look . I 'm sorry , Henrietta . One of the Spode plates , too . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Do n't take it so to heart , Henrietta . p. 14 HENRIETTA I ca n't help taking it to heart . MABEL I 'll get you another . ( Pause . More sharply as Henrietta does not answer . ) I said I 'll get you another plate , Henrietta . HENRIETTA It 's not the plate . MABEL For heaven 's sake , what is it then ? HENRIETTA It 's the significant little false movement once in a while . MABEL Well , I suppose everyone makes a false movement once in a while . HENRIETTA Yes , Mabel , but these false movements all mean something . MABEL ( About to cry . ) I do n't think that 's very nice ! It was just because I happened to think of Mabel Snow you were talking about  --  HENRIETTA Mabel Snow ! MABEL Snow  --  Snow  --  Well , what was her name , then ? HENRIETTA Her name is Mary . MABEL Well , Mary Snow , then ; Mary Snow . I never heard her name but once . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 HENRIETTA ( Gently . ) Mabel dear  --  mistakes like that in names  --  MABEL ( Desperately . ) They do n't mean something , too , do they ? HENRIETTA ( Gently . ) I am sorry , but they do . MABEL But I am always doing that ! HENRIETTA ( After a start of horror . ) My poor little sister , tell me all about it . MABEL About what ? HENRIETTA About your not being happy . About your yearnings for another sort of life . MABEL But I do n't . HENRIETTA Ah , I understand these things , dear . You feel Bob is limiting you to a life which you do not feel free  --  MABEL Henrietta ! When did I ever say such a thing ? HENRIETTA You said you are not in touch with things intellectual . You showed your feelings that it is Bob 's profession  --  that has engendered a resentment which has colored your whole life with him . p. 16 MABEL Why  --  Henrietta ! HENRIETTA Do n't be afraid , little sister . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not like that . I wanted you to come for this visit because I had a feeling that you needed more from life than you were getting . No one of these things I have seen would excite my suspicion . It 's the combination . You do n't eat breakfast ; you make false moves ; you substitute your own name for the name of another whose love is misdirected . You 're nervous ; you look queer ; in your eyes there 's a frightened look that is most unlike you . And this dream . A hen  --  Come with me this afternoon to Dr. Russell ! Your whole life may be at stake , Mabel . MABEL ( Gasping . ) Henrietta , I  --  you  --  you always were the smartest in the family , and all that , but  --  this is terrible ! I do n't think we ought to think such things , and  --  ( brightening . ) Why , I 'll tell you why I dreamed I was a hen . It was because last night , telling about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad as a wet hen . HENRIETTA ( Superior . ) Did you dream you were a wet hen ? MABEL ( Forced to admit it . ) No. p. 17 HENRIETTA No . You dreamed you were a dry hen . And why , being a hen , were you urged to step ? MABEL Maybe it 's because when I am getting on a street-car it always irritates me to have them call " Step lively . " HENRIETTA No , Mabel , that is only a child 's view of it  --  if you will forgive me . You see merely the elements used in the dream . You do not see into the dream ; you do not see its meaning . This dream of the hen  --  STEPHEN Hen  --  hen  --  wet hen  --  dry hen  --  mad hen ! ( Jumps up in a rage . ) Let me out of this ! HENRIETTA ( Hastily picking up dishes , speaks soothingly . ) Just a minute , dear , and we 'll have things so you can work in quiet . Mabel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She goes out with both hands full of dishes . ) STEPHEN ( Seizing hat and coat from the costumer . ) I 'm going to be psychoanalyzed . I 'm going now ! I 'm going straight to that infallible doctor of hers  --  that priest of this new religion . If he 's got honesty enough to tell Henrietta there 's nothing the matter with my unconscious mind , perhaps I can be let alone about it , and then I will be all right . ( From the door in a low voice . ) Do n't tell Henrietta I 'm going . It might take weeks , and I could n't stand all the talk . ( Exit desperately . ) Enter Henrietta . p. 18 HENRIETTA Where 's Steve ? Gone ? ( With hopeless gesture . ) You see how impatient he is !  --  how unlike himself ! I tell you , Mabel , I am nearly distracted about Steve . MABEL I think he 's a little distracted , too . HENRIETTA Well , if he 's gone  --  you might as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bookshop , and will have to leave you to yourself for an hour or two . ( As she puts her hat on , her eye , lighting up almost carnivorously , falls on an enormous volume on the floor beside the work table . The book has been half hidden from the audience by the wastebasket . She picks it up and carries it around the table toward Mabel . ) Here , dear , this is one of the simplest statements of psycho-analysis . You read it and then we can talk more intelligently . ( Mabel takes volume and staggers back under its weight to chair rear center , Henrietta goes to outer door , stops and asks abruptly . ) How old is Lyman Eggleston ? MABEL ( Promptly . ) He is n't forty yet . Why , what made you ask that , Henrietta ? ( As she turns her head to look at Henrietta her hands move toward the upper corners of the book balanced on her knees. ) p. 19 HENRIETTA Oh , nothing . Au revoir . ( Exit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slides to the floor . She starts ; looks at the book , then at the broken plate on the table . ) The plate ! The book ! ( She lifts her eyes , leans forward elbow on knee , chin on knuckles and plaintively queries . ) Am I unhappy ? Curtain @x The stage is set as in Scene I except that the breakfast table has been removed and set back against the wall . During the first few minutes the dusk of a winter afternoon deepens . Out of the darkness spring rows of double street-lights almost meeting in the distance . Henrietta is disclosed at the psychoanalytical end of Steve 's worktable . Surrounded by open books and periodicals she is writing . Steve enters briskly . STEPHEN What are you doing , my dear ? HENRIETTA My paper for the Liberal Club . STEPHEN Your paper on  --  ? HENRIETTA On a subject which does not have your sympathy . STEPHEN Oh , I 'm not sure I 'm wholly out of sympathy with psychoanalysis , Henrietta . You worked it so hard . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . HENRIETTA ( Loftily . ) I talked it because I knew you needed it . STEPHEN You have n't said much about it these last two weeks . Uh  --  your faith in it has n't weakened any ? HENRIETTA Weakened ? It 's grown stronger with each new thing I 've come to know . And Mabel . She is with Dr. Russell now . Dr. Russell is wonderful . From what Mabel tells me I believe he is going to prove that I was right . Today I discovered a remarkable confirmation of my theory in the hen-dream. p. 21 STEPHEN What is your theory ? HENRIETTA Well , you know about Lyman Eggleston . I 've wondered about him from the first . I 've never seen him , but I know he 's less bourgeois than Mabel 's other friends  --  more intellectual  --  and ( significantly ) she does n't see much of him because Bob does n't like him . STEPHEN But what 's the confirmation ? HENRIETTA Today I noticed the first syllable of his name . STEPHEN Ly ? HENRIETTA No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Mabel dreamed she was a hen . ( Steve laughs . ) You would n't laugh if you knew how important names are in interpreting dreams . Freud is full of just such cases in which a whole hidden complex is revealed by a single significant syllable  --  like this egg . STEPHEN Does n't the traditional relation of hen and egg suggest rather a maternal feeling ? HENRIETTA There is something maternal in Mabel  --  love , of course , but that 's only one element . p. 22 STEPHEN Well , suppose Mabel has n't a suppressed desire to be this gentleman 's mother , but his beloved . What 's to be done about it ? What about Bob ? Do n't you think it 's going to be a little rough on him ? HENRIETTA That ca n't be helped . Bob , like everyone else must face the facts of life . If Dr. Russell should arrive independently at this same interpretation I shall not hesitate to tell Mabel to leave her present husband . STEPHEN Um  --  um ! ( The lights go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks out . ) How long is it we 've lived here , Henrietta ? HENRIETTA Why , this is the third year , Steve . STEPHEN I  --  we  --  one would miss this view if one went away , would n't one ? HENRIETTA How strangely you speak ! Oh , Stephen , I wish you 'd go to Dr. Russell . Do n't think my fears have abated because I have been able to restrain myself . I felt I must on account of Mabel . It would n't do for her to hear you discrediting it while she was being analyzed . But now , dear  --  wo n't you go ? STEPHEN I  --  ( He breaks off , turns on the light , then comes and sits beside Henrietta . ) How long have we been married , Henrietta ? p. 23 HENRIETTA Stephen , I do n't understand you ! You must go to Dr. Russell . STEPHEN I have gone . HENRIETTA You  --  what ? STEPHEN ( Jauntily . ) Yes , Henrietta , I 've been psyched . HENRIETTA You went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what did he say ? STEPHEN He said  --  I  --  I was a little surprised by what he said , Henrietta . HENRIETTA ( Breathlessly . ) Of course  --  one can so seldom anticipate . But tell me  --  your dream , Stephen ? It means  --  ? STEPHEN It means  --  I was considerably surprised by what it means . HENRIETTA Do n't be so exasperating ! STEPHEN It means  --  you really want to know , Henrietta ? HENRIETTA Stephen , you 'll drive me mad ! STEPHEN He said  --  Of course he may be wrong in what he said . p. 24 HENRIETTA He is n't wrong . Tell me ! STEPHEN He said my dream of the walls receding and leaving me alone in a forest indicates a suppressed desire  --  HENRIETTA Yes  --  yes ! STEPHEN To be freed from  --  HENRIETTA Yes  --  freed from  --  ? STEPHEN Marriage . HENRIETTA ( Crumples . Stares . ) Marriage ! STEPHEN He  --  he may be mistaken , you know . HENRIETTA May be mistaken ! STEPHEN I  --  well , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was only your great confidence  --  HENRIETTA Stephen , are you telling me that Dr. Russell  --  Dr. A. R. Russell  --  told you this ? ( Steve nods . ) Told you you have a suppressed desire to separate from me ? STEPHEN That 's what he said . HENRIETTA Did he know who you were ? p. 25 STEPHEN Yes . HENRIETTA That you were married to me ? STEPHEN Yes , he knew that . HENRIETTA ( Rising . ) And he told you to leave me ? STEPHEN It seems he must be wrong , Henrietta . HENRIETTA And I 've sent him more patients  --  ! ( Catches herself and resumes coldly . ) What reason did he give for this analysis ? STEPHEN He says the confiding walls are a symbol of my feeling about marriage and that their fading away is a wish-fulfillment . HENRIETTA ( Gulping . ) Well , is it ? Do you want our marriage to end ? STEPHEN Well , it was a surprise to me that I did , Henrietta  --  a great surprise . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . HENRIETTA ( Flaming . ) What did you tell Dr. Russell about me ? What did you tell him to make him think you were not happy ? STEPHEN I never told him a thing , Henrietta . He got it all from his confound-clever inferences . I  --  I tried to refute them , but he said that was only part of my self-protective lying . p. 26 HENRIETTA And that 's why you were so  --  happy  --  when you came in just now ! STEPHEN Why , Henrietta , how can you say such a thing ? I was sad . Did n't I speak sadly of  --  of the view ? Did n't I ask you how long we had been married ? HENRIETTA ( Rising . ) Stephen Brewster , have you no sense of the seriousness of this ? Dr. Russell does n't know what our marriage has been . You do . You should have laughed him down ! Confined  --  in life with me ? Why did n't you tell him that I believed in freedom ? STEPHEN I very emphatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . HENRIETTA But you accepted them . STEPHEN Oh , not at all . I merely could n't refute his arguments . I 'm not a psychologist . I came home to talk it over with you . You being a disciple of psychoanalysis  --  HENRIETTA ( Whirling . ) If you are going , I wish you would go tonight ! STEPHEN Oh , my dear ! I  --  surely could n't do that ! Think of my feelings . And my laundry has n't come home yet . HENRIETTA I ask you to go tonight . Some women would falter at this , Steve , but I am not such a woman . I leave you free . I do not repudiate psychoanalysis , I say again that it has done great things . It has also made mistakes , of course . But since you accept this analysis  --  ( She sits down and pretends to begin work . ) I have to finish this paper . I wish you would leave me. p. 27 STEPHEN ( Scratches his head , goes to the inner door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . ( Exit . ) ( Henrietta 's face betrays her outraged state of mind  --  disconcerted , resentful , trying to pull herself together . She attains an air of bravely bearing an outrageous thing . Mabel enters in great excitement . ) MABEL ( Breathless . ) Henrietta , I 'm so glad you 're here . And alone ? ( Looks toward the inner door . ) Are you alone , Henrietta ? HENRIETTA ( With reproving dignity . ) Very much so . MABEL ( Rushing to her . ) Henrietta , he 's found it ! HENRIETTA ( Aloof . ) Who has found what ? MABEL Who has found what ? Dr. Russell has found my suppressed desire . HENRIETTA That is interesting . MABEL He finished with me today  --  he got hold of my complex  --  in the most amazing way ! But , oh , Henrietta  --  it is so terrible ! p. 28 HENRIETTA Do calm yourself , Mabel . Surely there 's no occasion for all this agitation . MABEL But there is ! And when you think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made in order to bring the suppressed hell out of me and save me from the insane asylum  --  ! HENRIETTA The insane asylum ! MABEL You said that 's where these complexes brought people ? HENRIETTA What did the doctor tell you , Mabel ? MABEL Oh , I do n't know how I can tell you  --  it is so awful  --  so unbelievable . MABEL Henrietta , who would ever have thought it ? How can it be true ? But the doctor is perfectly certain that I have a suppressed desire for  --  ( Looks at Henrietta unable to go on . ) HENRIETTA Oh , go on , Mabel . I 'm not unprepared for what you have to say . MABEL Not unprepared ? You mean you have suspected it ? HENRIETTA From the first . It 's been my theory all along . MABEL But , Henrietta , I did n't know myself that I had this secret desire for Stephen . p. 29 HENRIETTA ( Jumps up . ) Stephen ! MABEL My brother-in-law ! My own sister 's husband ! HENRIETTA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Henrietta , are n't these unconscious selves terrible ? They seem so unlike us ! HENRIETTA What insane things are you driving at ? MABEL ( Blubbering . ) Henrietta , do n't you use that word to me . I do n't want to go to the insane asylum . HENRIETTA ( Stonily . ) What did Dr. Russell say ? MABEL Well , you see  --  oh , it 's the strangest thing ! But you know the voice in my dream that called " Step , Hen ! " Dr. Russell found out today that when I was a little girl I had a story-book in words of one syllable and I read the name Stephen wrong . I used to read it S-t-e-p , step , h-e-n , hen . ( Dramatically . ) Step Hen is Stephen . ( Enter Stephen , his head bent over a time-table . ) Stephen is Step Hen ! STEPHEN I ? Step Hen ! p. 30 MABEL ( Triumphantly . ) S-t-e-p , step , H-e-n , hen , Stephen ! HENRIETTA ( Exploding . ) Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Step Hen ! Step Hen ! For that ridiculous coincidence  --  MABEL Coincidence ! But it 's so childish to look at the mere elements of a dream . You have to look into it  --  you have to see what it means ! HENRIETTA And do you mean to say that on account of that trivial , meaningless play on syllables  --  on that flimsy basis  --  you are ready  --  ( Wails ) O-h ! STEPHEN What on earth 's the matter ? What has happened ? Suppose I am Step Hen ? What about it ? What does it mean ? MABEL ( Crying . ) It means  --  that I  --  have a suppressed desire for you ! STEPHEN For me ! The deuce you have ? ( Feebly . ) What  --  er  --  makes you think so ? MABEL Dr. Russell has worked it out scientifically . p. 31 HENRIETTA Yes . Through the amazing discovery that Step Hen equals Stephen ! MABEL ( Tearfully . ) Oh , that is n't all  --  that is n't near all . Henrietta wo n't give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd go to the insane asylum than be unconventional . HENRIETTA We 'll all go there if you ca n't control yourself . We are still waiting for some rational report . MABEL ( Drying her eyes . ) Oh , there 's such a lot about names . ( With some pride . ) I do n't see how I ever did it . It all works in together . I dreamed I was a hen because that 's the first syllable of Hen-rietta 's name , and when I dreamed I was a hen , I was putting myself in Henrietta 's place . HENRIETTA With Stephen ? MABEL With Stephen . HENRIETTA ( Outraged . ) Oh ! ( Turns in rage upon Stephen who is fanning himself with the time-table . ) What are you doing with that time-table ? STEPHEN Why  --  I thought  --  you were so keen to have me go tonight  --  I thought I 'd just take a run up to Canada , and join Billy  --  a little shooting  --  but  --  p. 32 MABEL But there 's more about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob  --  dear old Bob  --  your good , kind husband ? MABEL Oh , Henrietta , " my good kind husband ! " HENRIETTA Just think of him out there in Chicago , working his head off , fixing people 's teeth  --  for you ! MABEL Yes , but think of the living Libido  --  in conflict with petrified moral codes ! And think of the perfectly wonderful way the names all prove it . Dr. Russell said he 's never seen anything more convincing . Just look at Stephen 's last name  --  Brewster . I dream I 'm a hen , and the name Brewster  --  you have to say its first letter by itself  --  and then the hen , that 's me , she says to him : " Stephen , Be Rooster ! " Henrietta and Stephen both collapse on chair and divan . MABEL I think it 's perfectly wonderful ! Why , if it was n't for psychoanalysis you 'd never find out how wonderful your own mind is ! STEPHEN ( Begins to chuckle . ) Be Rooster , Stephen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you ? p. 33 STEPHEN Well , what 's to be done about it ? Does Mabel have to go away with me ? HENRIETTA Do you want Mabel to go away with you ? STEPHEN Well , but Mabel herself  --  her complex  --  her suppressed desire  --  ! HENRIETTA Mabel , are you going to insist on going away with Stephen ? MABEL I 'd rather go with Stephen than go to the insane asylum ! HENRIETTA For Heaven 's Sake , Mabel , drop that insane asylum ! If you did have a suppressed desire for Stephen hidden away in you  --  God knows it is n't hidden now . Dr. Russell has brought it into consciousness  --  with a vengeance . That 's all that 's necessary to break up a complex . Psychoanalysis does n't say you have to gratify every suppressed desire . STEPHEN ( Softly . ) Unless it 's for Lyman Eggleston . HENRIETTA ( Turning on him . ) Well , if it comes to that , Stephen Brewster , I 'd like to know why that interpretation of mine is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! STEPHEN But Be Rooster ! ( He pauses , chuckling to himself . ) Step-Hen B-rooster and Henrietta . Pshaw , my dear , Doc Russell 's got you beat a mile ! ( He turns away and chuckles . ) Be rooster ! p. 34 MABEL What has Lyman Eggleston got to do with it ? STEPHEN According to Henrietta 's interpretation , you , the hen , have a suppressed desire for Lyman Eggleston , the egg . MABEL Henrietta , I think that 's indecent of you ! He is bald as an egg and little and fat  --  the idea of you thinking such a thing of me ! HENRIETTA Well , Bob is n't little and bald and fat ! Why do n't you stick to your own husband ? ( Turns on Stephen . ) What if Dr. Russell 's interpretation has got mine " beat a mile " ? ( Resentful look at him . ) It would only mean that Mabel does n't want Eggleston and does want you . Does that mean she is to have you ? MABEL But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not as much like her as you think  --  substituting your name for hers ! The cases are entirely different . Oh , I would n't have believed this of you , Mabel . I brought you here for a pleasant visit  --  thought you needed brightening up  --  wanted to be nice to you  --  and now you  --  my husband  --  you insist  --  ( Begins to cry . Makes a movement which brushes to the floor some sheets from the psychoanalytical table. ) p. 35 STEPHEN ( With solicitude . ) Careful , dear . Your paper on psychoanalysis ! ( Gathers up sheets and offers them to her . ) HENRIETTA ( Crying . ) I do n't want my paper on psychoanalysis ! I 'm sick of psychoanalysis ! STEPHEN ( Eagerly . ) Do you mean that , Henrietta ? HENRIETTA Why should n't I mean it ? Look at all I 've done for psychoanalysis  --  and  --  what has psychoanalysis done for me ? STEPHEN Do you mean , Henrietta , that you 're going to stop taking psychoanalysis ? HENRIETTA Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen what it does to people ? Mabel has gone crazy about psychoanalysis ! ( At the word " Crazy " Mabel sinks with a moan into the armchair and buries her face in her hands . ) HENRIETTA I 'm done with it ! STEPHEN ( Solemnly . ) Do you swear never to wake me up in the night to find out what I 'm dreaming ? HENRIETTA Dream what you please  --  I do n't care what you 're dreaming . p. 36 STEPHEN Will you clear off my work table so that the Journal of Morbid Psychology does n't stare me in the face when I 'm trying to plan a house ? HENRIETTA ( Pushing a stack of periodicals off the table . ) I 'll burn the Journal of Morbid Psychology ! STEPHEN My dear Henrietta , if you 're going to separate from psychoanalysis , there 's no reason why I should separate from you . ( They embrace ardently . Mabel lifts her head and looks at them woefully . ) MABEL ( Jumping up and going toward them . ) But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppressed desire ? STEPHEN ( With one arm still around Henrietta , gives Mabel a brotherly hug . ) Mabel , you just keep right on suppressing it . ( END OF PLAY. )
