The Diary of , Tames K. Polk During His Presidency , 1845-1849 . Edited by Milo M. Quaife ; with an introduction by Andrew C. McLaughlin . Chicago : A. C. McClurg &; Co. 4 vols. $20 net . The conditions under which Polk became President made it difficult for him to fill the office successfully . As a Jackson man he had the opposition of Calhoun , and as the one who took the prize from Van Buren , he could not have hearty support from the New Yorker . He thus had two Democratic factions against him at a time when the Whigs needed but a few votes to control the Senate . Besides Calhoun , three powerful party leaders were to be conciliated . Benton , strong with and his pride , and did not easily submit himself to leadership . He never supported Polk heartily . Buchanan and Cass , both aspirants for the Presidency , were too busy with their own prospects to unite cordially with the President for a party policy . Altogether , the situation was too complex for a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness to his perplexity . The first trouble was in connection with the Oregon question . By the Democratic platform , which he accepted , he was pledged to demand fifty-four degrees forty minutes . Cass and the Northwest supported the demand . The extreme Southerners were willing to take less , some of them favoring the Columbia River . Polk , ever a nationalist , had to reconcile the two sides ; for he could get no bill passed without the consent of both . Fifty-four degrees forty minutes meant war with England , and war could not be declared or fought without the consent of the South . Polk took a practical position , and renewed Tyler 's offer of the forty-ninth parallel to Puget Sound . It was rejected with scorn . He then recommended Congress to give the necessary year 's notice for ending the joint occupation of Oregon and taking steps to establish our sole Jurisdiction there He thought that if England saw we were in earnest , she would settle the matter amicably . The plan required unity and promptness , but the disaffected men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more than five months , until England doubted if'Polk 's plan would succeed at all . In the meantime , some important nominations were defeated in the Senate , through a combination of Whigs and insurgent Democrats Buchanan gave most trouble . Although Secretary of State , he constantly desired compromise and was overruled by the President . At last it was evident that England would accept the offer she rejected the preceding summer . Polk now took the dignified position that the proposition come from the other side . Buchanan thought we should renew our offer . He was exceedingly anxious to get the affair off the political stage Polk overruled him , but found it necessary to exercise the most careful scrutiny of the dispatches lest the Secretary of State should give the intimation of retraction which England might make a basis for renewing the negotiation . At last , he forced that Power to accept a treaty which proved satisfactory to all but the Northwest . It was charged later that he sacrificed Oregon in the interest of the South . His " Diary " shows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy with England . The " Diary " throws little new light on the Mexican war , but it proves that Polk was not an ardent pro-slavery man . He was of the school of Jackson , opposed to Calhoun and loyal to the Union He was an expansionist and a nationalist . He wanted California to complete our Pa. cific coast-line . He would purchase it , if he could , and fight for it if he must . In the same way , he desired Cuba . But he says nothing to show that his motive was chiefly to extend slavery . On the contrary , that desire is not mentioned , and it seems to have been incidental merely . Like other expansionists , ancient and modern , he was not scrupulous in his methods . He thought the Wilmot Proviso a political trick to discredit certain Presidential aspirants , and he regretted the serious manner in which some Southerners took it . He even pronounced their action selfish and malicious He opposed the meeting to protest against the opposition to slavery in the District of Columbia The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the South was to maintain the Democratic party as a national organization . Let the meeting , if it must be , appeal to the sense of fairness in the sober men in the North , let it express confidence in them and not indulge in threats or recrimination . Calhoun 's resolutions , he thought , tended to disunion through their influence on the people of the South . The best thing in the book is the revelation of the man who wrote it . He had industry , patience , capacity in detail , good Judgment , fairness to his associates , and loyalty to party- He was an excellent husband , a faithful churchgoer , with Methodist inclinations , and a gentleman in both public and personal affairs . Courage , or pertinacity , was his strongest quality . He was not mentally broad , he knew not how to dominate others , and he shows little magnanimity . He had the ordinary human virtues , and the ordinary human failings . He was President through accident , but in the period from Jackson to Lincoln , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government . Polk gives us a useful picture of Cabinet proceedings . He submitted to his advisers all kinds of business . They passed on the selection of a new Cabinet member as well as on a policy of state . He repeats with fulness what he said to his associates , but says little about their replies From this report , they seem to have been a complaisant group , all but Buchanan , who is presented as caprinions , selfish , and inconsistent . " Mr. Buchanan , " we read , " is an , able man , but is in small matters without judgment and sometimes acts like an old maid . " The most persistent note in the narrative is the complaint against office-seekers . From the beginning to the end of the Administration he was beset by applicants . " Lazy loafers " and " my old customers , " he called them ; and it was a good day when he did not have to give two hours to their requests Probably the patronage was then at its lowest plane . Partisanship was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slightest notion what they wanted or what they could do . One applicant had heard that some treaties were to be made and thought he would be a good hand at making one . The hunger of the office-seekers , said Polk , was our greatest political danger . It disorganized parties , defeated important measures , and impaired the civil service . He vowed that after his retirement he would write an exposition of the evil for the enlightenment of the people . Unfortunately , he died before he could perform the vow . It is natural to compare him with other prominent American diarists . He is more subjective than John Quincy Adams and not so versatile ; but lie wrote when public men seem smaller and less cultured . He is as straightforward as Adams and less given to personal antipathies. as a record of Cabinet activity , the " Diary " is very valuable , but in this respect , it is perhaps excelled by that of Gideon Welles , now being published . Polk tells what the President said in Cabinet , Welles tells what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covers the period from August 26 , 1845 , to June 2 , 1849 . Thirteen days after it ceased , the author died of cholera . For the years included , it is an important source of information . Several recent writers have used it in manuscript . Its publication extends its area of usefulness . The publishers are to be commended for using good paper and handsome type ; but the index is inadequate and most of the editor 's notes are perfunctory . CURRENT FICTION . Burning Daylight . By Jack London . New York : The Macmillan Co . In " Martin Eden " this brilliant short-story teller produced a novel which , however fantastic , was not of the sort to be laid down half-read , or forgotten on the instant of its completion . " Burning Daylight " has some points in common with it . Elam Harnish is an Alaskan pioneer who foresees , and makes a fortune out of , the gold strike at the Yukon . Having proved himself the best man on the frontier , he leaves it , with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in civilized life . There takes place no such while-you-wait conversion into a man of brilliant accomplishments and profound culture as fell to the experience of Mr. Martin Eden . Mr. Elam Harnish ( known throughout Alaska as " Burning Daylight " ) acquires the tailoring and superficial manners of the cities , but remains himself . By nature a gambler , the only question he asks is what game he shall play . All business presents itself to him as gambling , and he quickly makes up his mind that the players are a far less " square " lot than his old antagonists at the Klondike . A supposed friend robs him of half a million ; and three Eastern financiers lure him on to New York with the express intention of stripping him bare . They do get his fortune , whereupon he gets it back by a delightfully ( if impossibly ) direct Western method . He goes back to the Pacific Coast hardened and sharpened as a player at the money game . His days are given to battle , and his evenings to the drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain , and so finally wins him sleep before the next day 's fight . He constitutes himself the enemy of the big operators , the owners of corporations , and the manipulators of trade . In short , it is his professed purpose to rob those who rob the poor ; but he is really more anxious to heat them than to protect their victims . He becomes steadily coarsened , loses the splendid physical strength which has made him the hero of the Northwest , and is on the road to the gross estate of the money-hog , when the love of woman saves him . He suddenly wakes to the situation , tosses away his millions , and flees with his bride to a ranch in the hills , where he earns a sufficient living by his own labor , wins back his old strength of body and youth of spirit , and becomes more than ever a man . The remarkable thing is that , as Mr. London tells the story , not one reader in fifty will be disposed to regard Daylight 's act as anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melodrama is supplied at the last moment by Daylight 's discovery of a marvellous vein of gold on his ranch , his momentary excitement , and his final concealment of the fact , even from his wife . But this is by all odds the most interesting , as well as most wholesome , long story Mr. London has written . The Rosary . By Florence L. Barclay . New York : G. P. Putnam 's Sons . If cleanliness is the sole requisite in a novel  --  and there are novels which make one think so  --  then " The Rosary " is entitled to unmixed praise . Besides being clean , it is single-minded and highsouled . It tells a tale of faithful love and self-denial . It enters as an expert into the experiences of the blind It pictures men , women , places , and a parrot with a touch both light and sweet , and sometimes humorous It is definitely religious in tone without cant . Thus much is but justice to the story Justice to the reader requires mention of the gush , mush , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is gush musical centring in one song and one hymn which sound throughout the book ; gush medical , matrimonial , Platonic . Much gush over Jane , the plain , massive , gentlemanly-lady heroine . She wears thoroughly described and perfectly fitting clothes . She is triumphantly athletic . Her " large capable hands " figure so often in the story that one receives the impression of a lady Briareus in golf skirts . She is proverbially plain , but highly captivating and atmospherically admonitory to boy-kind . She calls her friends " Boy , " or " Dear Boy , " or  --  to her subsequent sorrow and chastisement ? " Mere Boy " In her capable , tailor-made way she has inspired all the good deeds of the story Orderlies , doctors , and soldiers in Africa would have given their right hands for her . The flagging tennis player at the sound of " that dear voice " saying , " Play up , Dal ! " smiled , and with a lightning-like serve won game and set . With one singing of a song she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exaltation over her so that he exclaims in a low voice , vibrant with emotion ? " My God ! Oh , my God ! " Yet this same lover three years later can be deceived into thinking for weeks that the voice of the nurse who is ministering to his blindness is not his Jane 's , and that that voice proceeds from the supposed low altitude of a " little dainty person " and not from Jane 's five feet eleven inches Possibly three years of battening on two articles of musical diet had blunted his ear . At the wedding we have sentiment sandwiched with vaudeville , the old Scotch nurse following the ceremony audibly , the English duchess giving her niece away with a short comic speech . For those who like five lumps of sugar in their music and their emotions it is the very book . Freda . By Katherine Tynan . New York : Cassell &; Co .

Bailey . New York : Brentano 's . The French Revolution continues to present itself to the ardent romancer as a fruitful field for his more or less ingenuous activities The " Tale of Two Cities " did not exhaust the possibilities of the scene or the action of that spectacular drama . Many later stories of the Revolution have hung more closely to the fact  --  not a few of them far too closely , after all , since a romance is not a monograph in disguise . Mr. Bailey 's instinct has led him to avoid the greater revolutionary figures as puppets for his action . And in choosing a hero like his Vicomte de Jan he has given an " up-to-date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jan , indeed , is the whimsical , indecisive , irresponsible hero of this present hour  --  a Septimus or Senhouse with sword and queue . He is the son of a noble who has fled from the Vendee to England . The Vicomte is summoned to play his part in that beggarly Grand Army of the Vendee which is making unreasonable headway against the republican forces . The vicomte drifts vaguely into the thick of the conflict , to find himself disgusted with the brutality and banality of it all . He declines the post of honor which is offered him at the head of his fellowVencleans , and expresses his opinion of ttaem very frankly . But there is a girl of good blood among their leaders , who scorns him for his indifference to the cause . Of course , she is really attracted to him and he to her . To rescue her , he presently finds himself fighting : they are ' both captured by the republicans , and condemned to death . Needless to say , they escape , to suffer manifold adventures , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion of the youth and the maiden since romance began . The story is told with unusual buoyancy , and the Vicomte de Jan and his ally , Mr. Wild , are not less witty than their prototypes ( for that is the , word to use ) in current fiction . The Meddlings of Eve . By William John Hopkins . Boston : Houghton Mifflin Co . The meddlings of Eve and her some what consciously quaint chronicler , Adam , with the love affairs of certain acquaintances , give this book whatever substance it may be said to have . The " clammer " here maintains his sprightliness , if with perhaps a trace of effort . The setting is the familiar one , that idyllic abode of Adam and Eve , fronted with Adam 's clam-bed and , beyond , with an incidental ocean ; and flanked by the magnificence of " Old Goodwin . " Old Goodwin plays his whimsically benevolent part in the present leisure:y action , the most blameless ogre that ever gnashed his teeth in print . To him Eve owes that balmy background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where would be the peculiar piquancy in the relation of the paradisiacal pair if she were the daughter of another clammer , professional or amateur ? We here find their existence in continued oscillation between clam-bed and motor-car , love in a cottage and love a la mode . The latter species of passion , to be sure , directly concerns other persons , but they themselves are delightedly involved in its conduct . Of course , everything comes out according to Eve 's moving and Adam 's seconding . There seems to be no reason why Mr. Hopkins should not go on indefinitely with the mild adventures of this ingen-ious pair . But it is not well that a work of whimsical sentiment should have too many sequels . " Sentimental Tommy " came to a timely end ; and the " Bachelor " fortunately did not carry his reveries beyond their second series . The Siege of the Seven Suitors . By Meredith Nicholson . Boston : Houghton Mifflin Co . A. witty and wise gentleman whose business it is to cure smoky chimneys goes out to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County to deal with a flue that has fallen into inexplicably bad habits . The old lady has with her a niece whom she is determined to marry after a crotchety scheme of her own , which is the occasion of the seven suitors and of the chimney-man 's surprising adventures . The besieged niece , by the way , has a sister who has a share in the adventures and in the adventurer 's fate . The interest of the tale is in the fantastically whimsical manner that Mr. Locke has made so popular . Mr. Nicholson 's humor is a trifle thin if compared with that of " The Beloved Vagabond " and " Septimus , " and will , we suspect , meet with very different acceptance from different readers . Those who take up the book in the right mood and bring to it a proper and docile fancy of their own , will find it charming and refreshing . Some of them may even be tempted to hunt for the mysterious Asolando caf ? somewhere just off Fifth Avenue , though that haunt of virgin wsthetes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's imagination . Mr. Nicholson 's style  --  and style is everything in this sort of writing  --  would profit if , out of deference to Lindley Murray , he would learn not to say , " It was ordered . . . that you become . " That is the first sentence in the book , and it is not the only example of false sequence of tenses . DR . JOHNSON . Six Essays on Johnson . By Walter Ra-leigh . New York : Henry Frowde . If , as the saying goes , to abuse Boileau porte malheur , it is equally true , and for somewhat the same reason , that to praise Dr. Johnson brings good luck . There is a tronic quality in his wisdom and in his intellectual veracity which saves the critic from the pitfalls that waylay him when dealing with more imaginative writers . Professor Raleigh always has himself pretty well in hand , even when he writes under the spell of the Wordsworth cult , but he is particularly sound in these six essays which treat various aspects of Johnson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism in the opening essay , which was delivered as the first Leslie Stephen lecture at the University of Cambridge . " A commonplace , I take it , " he there says , " is an oft-repeated truth which means nothing to the hearer of it . But for the most perfect kind of commonplace we must enlarge this definition by adding that it means nothing also to the speaker of it . . . . Almost every number of the Rambler contains reflections and thoughts which cease to be Commonplace when the experiences that suggested them are remembered . " There is , perhaps , a hitch in Professor Raleigh 's logic as it is set down , but at bottom he answers a question which every reader of Johnson must have asked himself many times . The Rambler and , to a less extent , Johnson 's other works are filled with solemn reflections on the oldest and tritest of themes  --  on death and time and the vanity of life and the deceitfulness of the human heart and the consolations of religion . There is no attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applications , and the language is often slow and sometimes overweight-ed . Why , then , do these commonplace reflections on man and the world have to the true Johnsonian a meaning and a power of conviction that make the cleverness of England 's modern school of essayists seem like the crackling of thorns under an empty pot ? Professor Raleigh suggests the true answer . It is because , however they may sound to the inexperienced reader , they were not commonplaces to Johnson himself , but the fruit of vivid personal experience . His philosophy might be described as the sublime of the commonplace . So it is that Dr. Johnson has " come to be regarded as a kind of Chairman to humanity , whose business it is to cry ' Order , Order , ' an embodiment of corporate tradition and the settled wisdom of the ages . " There is much else to commend in Professor Raleigh 's essays , as he takes up the discussion of Johnson 's style and other topics of the kind . His estimate Of the " Lives " is admirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the- critic of Shakespeare . After comparing two statements from Johnson and Coleridge and showing that the earlier critic has not been superseded , Professor Raleigh , who has shown himself in his other books to be in no wise blind to the virtues of the romantic movement , continues : He has been neglected and depreciated ever since the nineteenth century brought in the new esthetic and philosophical criticism . The twentieth century , it seems likely , will treat him more respectfully . The romantic attitude begins to be fatiguing . The great romantic critics , when they are writing at their best , do succeed in communicating to the reader those thrills of wonder and exaltation which they have felt in contact " with Shakespeare 's imaginative work . This is not a little thing to do ; but it can not be done continuously , and it has furnished the workaday critic with a vicious model . There is a taint of insincerity about romantic criticism , from which not even the great romantics are free . They are never in danger . from the pitfalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling upward , as it were , into vacuity . They love to lose themselves in an 0 altitudo . From the most worthless material they will fashion a new hasty altar to the unknown God . When they are inspired by their divinity , they say wonderful things ; when the inspiration fails them their language is maintained at the same height , and they say more than they feel . You can never be sure of them . On one or two points we might take issue with Professor Raleigh . In his zeal for the great Cham he even questions Boswell 's account of Johnson 's voracity . Now , Macaulay 's paraphrase of Boswell , which represents Johnson as " tearing his meat like a tiger and swallowing his tea in oceans , " is  --  just a bit of Macaulay 's rhetoric . But there is too much confirmation of Boswell 's picture  --  by Chesterfield , for instance , whom , perhaps as an enemy of Johnson , Professor Raleigh does not mention  --  to suppose it is not true . It is a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raleigh falls when he compares the attitude of authors toward pay for their work with the attitude of men in business . " Yet iron-founders and cotton-brokers , " he exclaims in a fit of strange excitement , " do not , in discussing the operations of their profoundly beneficent trades , express themselves wholly in terms of genius and virtue . " Quite true , and neither , for that , does the self-respecting author . But it is a fact , nevertheless , that the relation of a business man 's work to his reward in money is totally different from that of an artist 's or author 's . The former is working in a field where ability and success are measured directly in pecuniary quantities , whereas with the artist pecuniary success can afford no such measure . We do not believe that Dr. Johnson would have countenanced the deductions made by his present critic from his famous remark on writing for pay . Introduction to Political Science . By James Wilford Garner , Professor of Political Science of the University of Illinois . New York : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is intended as a text-book for students , covers a wider range than is usual in treatises of the kind . After defining the scope and the methods of political science , it treats of the nature , form , constitution , and the essential elements of the state , and of the various theories propounded as to its origin and proper functions . It also includes chapters on the distribution of the powers of government , on the legisative , executive , and judiciary departments , besides also treating of citizenship , nationality , and the electorate . A bibliography of the best ' literature in English , French , German , and Italian is placed at the head of each chapter , and many additional authorities are cited in the footnotes . It is evident that a thorough discussion of all these subjects would be impossible . The author frankly confesses that he makes no pretension to having covered the field in an exhaustive manner . We notice , however , sonic omissions which should have been supplied . While there is a full discussion of the representative system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct legislation , while the referendum , the initiative , and the right of recall are dismissed with a few words and without reference to the form in which they exist at the present time . No mention is made of the official recognition of parties and the regulation of their primaries , which is one of the most characteristic features of American public law . Where the author discusses the distinction between bureaucratic and popular government , from the standpoint of the organization and spirit of the administrative service , there is nothing said of the civil-service reform , by which it is sought to secure the efficiency of bureaucratic government while avoiding its dangers . The author expresses his dissent from those who , without regard to the actual facts , would solve political problems by the application of abstract conceptions . In discussing the theory of state functions he comes to the conclusion that no a priori solution of their relation can be found , and that the comprehensive ground of general expediency is alone common to them . Yet when he undertakes to discuss the doctrine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important topics , if not quite the most important , in political science , he is a doctrinaire of the doctrinaires . Sovereignty he regards as unthinkable unless it is unlimited and undivided . Even the limitations prescribed for making changes in a state 's own constitutional organization are merely instances of self-limitation and not legal restrictions , since " it is a matter of common knowledge that such provisions have in the past been time and again set aside for other methods . " But as the author himself says in another part of his book , this is " ignoring the fundamental distinction between power legally exercised and power usurped and illegally exercised . " Unless we go back to the theory , repudiated by the author , of the existence of a sovereignty of the people , independent of and superior to the constitn , tion , it is difficult to say why such limitation is not a limitation in the true sense of the word . The importance of this point is perhaps merely academic . But his theory that there is no sovereignty unless it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admits that text-writers and also the Supreme Court of the United States have unanimously held to the theory of the existence , under our Constitution , of a dual sovereignty , yet he cites with approval the statement of Willoughby , in his book on the " Nature of the State , " to the effect that under our system the States " are not States but administrative districts with larger powers of autonomy than are given others . " He adds that this is " legally an absolutely correct statement of the status of the so-called States of the American Federal Republic . " But he does not adopt the view that the central government is sovereign . There is , according to him , somewhere a power over and above both which can redistribute the powers of government between them , and " wherever it is , there is the sovereign . " He complains that the task of " running the sovereign to cover " is not easy , and " that it is difficult to say whether the sovereignty resides in the people of the country at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , or either . " The difficulty would be increased if he had remembered the provision of the Constitution that no State can be deprived , without its own consent , of its equal representation in the Senate . To us it should seem that there can be a question of seeking where th , e sovereignty in a state resides , only after it has first been established that we have to deal with a sovereign state . Such a search , if we agree with the conclusions of the author , that in this country we have no sovereign governmental organization at all , must be futile . Nor do we see how a concept , which has been repudiated by the Supreme Court of the United States and every court since the Constitution went into effect , can be said to be an absolutely correct statement of the law . It may be that , in the course of evolution , the change which seems to be in accord with the wishes of the author will take place ; that the nation , as a whole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative divisions with a certain amount of autonomy . But when the author asserts that they are so now , merely because they do not come up to his abstract definitions of sovereignty , he is guilty of the same dogmatism which he rightly condemns in others . Romantic California . By Ernest Peixotto . New York : ? Charles Scribner 's Sons . $2.60 net . Ten years ago Charles Dudley Warner wrote a delightful book on Southern California which he called " Our Italy , " because of climatic and other similari ties . He also referred to that region as " Our New Italy without malaria , " and for this lack and divers other reasons seemed to prefer it to Italy itself . Not a few Italians have apparently shared this preference ; California has appealed to them because of its soft breezes , its blue sky and sea , its oranges and figs , and also because of its being a land of gold ? " a bit of his own Latin land , and an adventurer 's land , too . " It is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his latest volume ; he searches out the veritable bits of the motherland to be found on Californian soil , and tells his readers what he has seen in these colonies that retain traditions intact , live the picturesque life of the old country , cultivate their patches of basilic ? for the minestra , dry their strings of garlic on the roof-tops , ' and mend their brown nets in the sunlight by the sea . He also takes us to the Italian quarter in San Francisco , one of the first to be rebuilt after the great &re,; a region with genuine Italian trattoria and theatres , but with a language now getting mixed , like " Pennsylvania Dutch , " as illustrated by a sign advertising apartments to rent and concluding with the information , " La chiave al janitor in rear . " Having paid his visits to the Italians , our author calls upon the Spaniards , inspecting the old missions , which are now benefiting by the spirit of conservation which has begun to sweep over the land ; indulging in souvenirs of the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retain the romantic charm of the Spanish occupation  --  towns whose thick-walled adobe houses are still roofed with pottery tiles , while the streets are cooled by alamedas of pepper trees and tall files of eucalypti . His next excursion is throligh Bret Harte 's country , and in this chapter he seeks to confute those critics who maintain that that story-writer did not , correctly portray the life of the early mining days . Jimtown , to be sure , is now Jamestown , and can be reached comfortably by the recently constructed Sierra railway ; but Angels is still as much a mining camp as ever , and what one sees there and in other places shows that the embroidery Bret Harte put on his stories " is but a varnish over cold fact . " Romantic California is further illustrated , in word and picture , by an exploration of the coast , and finally by a few days ' sojourn among the seals and birds of the Farallones , thirty miles at sea from the Golden Gate  --  islands on which blow at times storms of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their hands and knees . The fact that the Farallones can be visited only by special permit , difficult to obtain , will fortunately preserve them from the unhappy fate of Santa Ca. - Latina , off Los Angeles , which has become a fashionable summer resort . Even if the 219 pages of reading matter in this volume were less alluring , the profuse illustrations would make it a strong ally of the tourist maxim , " See America first . " There are no fewer than sixty-eight of them , mostly in this artist 's happiest vein , and no one , surely , can look at pictures like Strange Groves of Cypress Point , In the Gaviota Pass , Point Lobos , San Francisco Bay , Los Farallones de los Frayles , Cormorants on their Nests , Shasta , without developing an eager desire to visit these romantic spots . The History of Gruffydd ap Cynan : The Welsh text with translation , introduction , and notes . By Arthur Jones , M.A. Manchester : University Press . It is a satisfaction to receive from the press of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school of Celtic studies , established there by the late Prof. John Strachan . A volume by Tomas ( ) Waffle on the language of the " Annals of Ulster , " begun under Strachan 's supervision , is announced to appear in the - university punlications , and the work now under review , together with another that is promised on the legal vocabulary of the " Black Book of Chirk , " testifies to the activity of Manchester students on the Brythonic side of Celtic philology . Mr. Jones 's book is a useful , though hardly a distinguished , piece of work . The " History of Gruffydd ap Cynan " deals with an important figure in the national life of Wales during the early Norman period , and while it is by no means to be regarded as a trustworthy narrative , its testimony on many points , as Mr. Jones shows , can not be left out of account . The material , at all events , is historical , rather than legendary , and its composition , perhaps in an earlier Latin form to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following Gruffydd . ThiS possibility gives the document a special claim on the attention of the historian , and at the same time connects it with a period of great interest to the student of Welsh literature  --  with the century of Geoffrey of Monmouth . The " History of Gruffydd " has very little in common , however , with the legendary narrative of the " Historia Regum Britannia . " It is rather to be associated , as a piece of eulogistic biography , with the numerous poems of praise written by the contemporary bards for the kings or tribal chiefs under whom they served . It makes a kind of prose counterpart to these most representative products of the Welsh poetry of the time . Such is the interest of the document , which has been accessible hitherto only in late and inferior texts . Mr. Jones 's ' chief service consists in having made an edition and translation from the thirteenth century MS . Peniarth 17 , and supplied in his introduction and notes valuable explanatory material drawn from other histories and chronicles . He has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His translation , so far as we have examined it , is careful and trustworthy , and , in point of English style , it is better , oddly enough , than the introduction , in which the author had a freer hand at composition . The ineptness and occasional obscurity of Mr. Jones 's language suggest an inexperienced writer or one not quite familiar with English idiom . The Welsh text of the " history , " we have , of course , not been able to collate with its source . We have found no reason in reading it to doubt its accuracy , though it departs in trifling details from the excerpts of the same manuscript printed by Mr. Gwenogvryn Evans for the Historical Manuscripts Commission . But the typographical errors which disfigure other parts of the book ( such as the omission of " been " ( ' ? ) on p. 25 , and the misprints 1908 for 1098 on the same page , conym for eoram on p. 22 , Gogadh for Cogadh on p. 186 , and Earchmarcach for Eachmarcach on p. 77 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not control . The Intimate Life of Alexander Hamilton . Based chiefly upon original family letters . By Allan McLane Hamilton . New York : Charles Scribner 's Sons . $3.50 net . While this volume of varied interest makes no pretence of throwing a great amount of new light upon either the public career or the private life of Hamilton , it does much to complete the picture of both . We get a fresh and firmer conception , for example , of the unflinching labor which went along with Hamilton 's genius in achieving what he did in the law and in statesmanship . It is made pretty plain that he had given more time , and earlier , to his legal studies than had been supposed , so that it could hardly be said , in the phrase of one of his latest biographers , Oliver , that he " began at the top of his profession . " ? The specimen briefs and outlines of legal arguments here printed show with what care of preparation Hamilton entered ' court . For the rest , Dr. Hamilton draws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relating to his grandfather 's courtship and ' marriage , early housekeeping ( specimen entries show that the high cost of living troubled people even in 1791 ) , income from professional earnings , and so on . Particular attention is given to the duel with Burr , the conflicting testimony of the seconds being set forth fully , and the medical reports being , as is natural , carefully weighed . In the matter of Hamilton 's parentage , the facts are printed without either mystery or exaggeration , so that the reader is put in a position to understand what and how little force there was in the charge that he was illegitimate . Nearly thirty illustrations and facsimiles add to the value of the book , which is handsomely printed with full appendices and an index . The author 's style is adequate to the matter , but a little loose at times . Thus , in referring to Hamilton 's affairs with women , his grandson speaks , with a severity which we presume was not intended , of his Zilches .
