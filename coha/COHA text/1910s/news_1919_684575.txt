txt Utah Copper Co. declared a quarterly dividend of $1.50 a share , Chino 75 cents , Ray Consolidated 50 cents , and Nevada 371k cents a share . These are the same as three months ago and are payable June 20 to stock of record June 16 . The action of the directors of the porphyry copper companies in continuing the quarterly dividends did not come in the nature of a surprise , on account of the increasing optimism regarding the copper outlook . Reports in thefirst quarter showed a big loss in operations , due to the fact that production was curtailed , little metal was sold , and , furthermore , the basis on which earnings . were computed , was under actual production cost . On the other hand , costs per pound showed a healthy reduction , compared with he last quarter of 1919 , and it is expected that operatii.g charges in the three months period to end June 30 will be materially reduced from the level prevailing in the lirzt quarter . While copper sales are not of very big proportions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing . This applies to domestic business . Authorities look forward to substantial export orders after the peace treaty is signed . Everything considered , it would seem as if 17 to 20 cents a . pound for copper through the rest of the year , and a further reduction in costs , may make it possible for these companies to contirme current disbursements through 1919 , provided , of course , demand shows a consistent expansion , and output is not materially increased .
