 | The present paper is the second part of a striking eulogy of Jackson which was written by Judge Daniel Bedinger Lucas about 1869 and partially printed in the Southern Metropolis . In it the author shows characteristic courage and loyalty by paying high tribute to Jefferson Davis in the days of defeat and adversity . Readers will find the first part of the essay in the January QUARTERLY of the present year under the title " Stonewall Jackson : The Christian Warrior . " The introduction to the paper in the January number contains a brief sketch of the distinguished career of Judge Lucas . Through the kindness of Miss Virginia Lucas , the daughter of Judge Lucas , the QUARTERLY has been able to obtain this eloquent oration on Jackson for publication. ? THE EDITORS . General Lee 's dispatch of the 3rd of May 1863 , announcing the battle of Chancellorsville , commenced auspiciously , " Yesterday General Jackson penetrated to the rear of the enemy , and drove him from all his positions , from the Wilderness to within one mile of Chancellorsville . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its concluding sentence , that " General Jackson was severely wounded . " The enthusiastic had believed he bore a charmed life . The glad notes of victory were soon hushed to silence by the announcement of the danger in which his life now hung suspended . Finally , on Tuesday , the tenth of May , the inquiries of the city were but too sadly answered by the dispatch of the faithful Pendleton ? a name ever associated with Jackson 's in the hearts and memory of his countrymen ? saying " General Jackson died at fifteen minutes past three this afternoon . His remains will go to Richmond tomorrow . " And on the morrow they came , and were conveyed to the mansion of the Governor of Virginia . The next day all business was suspended ; the grief of the people was solemn ; silent , deep , unutterable ? such as it has remained to this day ? a great volume of tideless grief like the Baltic Sea , which knows neither flux nor reflex . A new flag  | was folded about the coffin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ensign ? length 24 feet , width twothirds of the length , union two-thirds of the width , saltier eighteen inches wide , wide edging two and a quarter inches , stars fifteen inches from point to point and placed twenty inches apart from centre to centre , bending six inches in width . Such was the new ensign which coming to a nation without a flag , was destined to become a flag without a nation . Its first office was now typical ? its cross and white field emblematic of the faith and spotless character of the dead captain whom it shrouded . I heard no bells , nor other sound in token of the dead , save the boom of the signal cannon at the foot of Virginia 's monument to her immortal sons . Here again , and for the last time , the deep-mouthed cannon was sounding out this noise ? Jackson , but the hero 's form was as mute , as motionless as the statues above him , doubly imperishable , in glory and in bronze ! Every hero has his Eternal Attitude ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earth to assume in the Pantheon of Fame . There was Washington with sword and index finger ? the father of his country and the monitor of the future ; there was Henry in the grand climax of St. John 's Church ; there was Jefferson with a scroll in his hand , involving the principles which both nations professed to reverence , but the benefit of which each stubbornly refused to accord to others ; there was George Mason , in a posture of warning eloquence , deprecating the delegation of that sovereignty on the part of Virginia which it was now costing her so much blood and treasure to resume ; and there were some vacant niches which Virginia shall not hesitate to fill , in that day when our children shall build up the tombs of the prophets whom their fathers slew . Jackson , too , for whom this cannon booms , practiced here on her soil his eternal attitude , and did not die before the study was complete . Napoleon , in front of his flag , surmounted by the brazen eagle , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms folded above his breast ? revolving the destiny of empires ; Caesar at the tomb of Achilles , or pausing on the Thessalian stream ,  | brought to a stand by that doubt with which history still knits her brow ; Nelson , on the prow of the Victory at Trafalgar , giving out those sublime words to Englishmen ; Columbus on the beach of a new world ? all these have their eternal attitudes , and , the moment I mention their names , they stand out in round projection before you . But in the Temple Jackson is standing too ; and I dare to say that not Napoleon with brow and frontal scope moulded like the imperial globe ; not Alexander , with the divine light of Empire in his eyes , for whom Mt . Athos was to be hewn a statue , with a city in the right hand and a far-sweeping river in the left ; not Julius " foremost man of all this world , " whose empire was bounded by the ocean and his fame by the stars ; not Gustavus Adolphus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards stood as a marble lion , with sword and helmet , in the heart of the German Empire for two centuries ? none of these will be a figure more imperishable than that in a faded suit of grey , with the soiled and weatherbeaten cap , seated on his horse , overlooking the field of battle , his hand outstretched to the sky , his face upturned to Heaven , underwritten by the finger of Fame : " Jackson on the field of battle , supplicating God for victory ! " It was of this figure that this cannon beneath Virginia 's monument spoke to those vacant niches on this sad 12th of May , 1863 . I saw the procession , and noted its members and order as it filed through the main street of the devoted capital . The Chief Marshal was General George W. Randolph , a grandson of Thomas Jefferson . Had the procession been divided into three parts , with the hearse at the front attended by its guard , and the Governor of Virginia with the city authorities in the rear , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on whose features were stamped unmistakable traces of great sorrow . A man with erect , military figure , clad in neat grey , was at this period to be seen once or twice a day traversing the capitol square . His was a head on the classic model , and his features to my observation had somewhat of the poetic cast ; the expression thoughtful and careworn , the cheeks thin and deeply furrowed , the nose not small , but delicate and Grecian , the mouth beautifully chiseled , with an upper lip of  | firmness and the lower one swelling under it with a fine touch of sentiment ? neither the warrior 's nor the diplomat 's mouth , but rather that of the prophet , or of some sweetly-balanced orator . " A live dog is more to be dreaded than a dead lion . " There is a dead lion now , less to be dreaded than many living dogs who are baying at him . And yet there was a time when this man-lion walked the Southern land calling for his rights as the Libyan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called and thousands of mailed warriors responded ? but in vain . Therefore , he is now an obsolete hero ? obsolete to all the purposes of his former career . There is nothing left him now but to die with a dignity worthy of , his life . He has fulfilled his mission , as had Jackson in whose honor , and with great grief , he was there present on that sad twelfth of May , eighteen hundred and sixty-three . If the principles for which both contended are true , as I verily believe , then their lives forfeited in their defense were perhaps the best defense of them of which the present day is capable ; and he is but a poor philosopher and worse Christian who believes that Truth can ever die , or that the pressure of external force can ever settle , in the sense of justly deciding , fundamental moral principles . It is impossible for me to speak of Jackson 's life without adverting to the Cause for which he imperilled and , in the end , sacrificed it . And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true representative Leader of that Cause , I deem it more appropriate to answer the question of its justice . We are told by the politicians that the South appealed to war , and the issue has been decided against her , and therefore she must bury the dead issue . Now , I know of no proposition more at variance with the truth in its premises , or more illogical in its conclusion . The South did not appeal to war ; the North appealed to war , and the South to God . War has decided the issue in one way ; God perhaps in another . One war bears the same relation to the contest for a principle that one battle does to a war ; and the first Manassas no more decided the struggle against the North , than has the first war decided the principle of self-government , for which she contended , against the South . I do not say that the principle must of  | page deleted  | the end teach both you and your enemies that this principle is right , and must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I am ignorant that the war was not waged on account of Slavery . The true issue is eliminated by simply placing in juxta-position two historical utterances . Said Mr. Lincoln in his first inaugural : " We do not fight to abolish Slavery , but to restore the Union . " Said Jefferson Davis to the semi-official Commission who sounded him as to the amicable adjustment of the controversy : " We do not fight for slavery , but for Independence . " Here then was the issue ? the right of each State to govern itself . Jackson thought Virginia had this right ; and , in vindication of the justice of his view , it would only be necessary to place side by side two other historical documents : the one the ratification by the people of Virginia of the Constitution of the United States on the 25th day of June , 1788 , and the other the repeal and abrogation of the same act by the ordinance of April 17th , 1861 ; the one the delegation of specific powers by an admitted Sovereign , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other the resumption of those powers in the case contemplated and provided for by the very act of delegation ! If these passages from history do not make a platform broad and strong enough to support a man who believed himself right , then Jackson must fall . The intelligence of this present time has decided in his favor ; and there is little danger of this verdict 's being set aside in the future . Rather shall it be confirmed by posterity , and ratified by history ; so that Jackson shall not only be spoken of always , but shall be always well spoken of ? his name itself a benediction throughout all ages . Thus much for the Cause in which he perished . Yet all men should distinguish between duties and rights . The one may be waived , the other can not be neglected or omitted . Duty may permit , may demand the waiving or even relinquishment of a right ; but she must ever protest against that base apostasy which forswears the truth and consents to brand with infamy the brave who have dared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consistently have acquiesced in and consented to a permanent union under the Hanoverian dynasty ; but it  | page deleted  | tue . It was only when conquered that Phoenicia carried light and letters into Greece ; it was only when conquered that Jerusalem gave Christianity to Rome ; and only when conquered that Rome gave laws to the world ! Thus do conquered nations conquer their conquerers ! . . . . These , dear , darling dead of ours have not died in vain ! . . . They shall rise again ; and Jackson rising with them , like some Magnificent Builder , shall bound the empire of Fame , as Hadrian , Trajan and Antoninus , the three noblest of the Caesars , encompassed that of Rome ? with a Stonewall ! And with them shall rise too the man whom I saw in the procession weeping for Jackson ? the Great Unpardoned , who still with soul erect and all undismayed asks absolution from none but God ! He , the leading character in the great Drama the first act of which is over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear him witness that from prologue to epilogue he , at least , was an Actor worthy of his part . His mission is full ? his career finished , and there is nothing left him now but to close the book and fold his hands and sit him down and die . This is all for this day and time ; but embalmed in memory , he shall live coevally with the principles he represented and impersonated . and with which he is but buried to survive forever in their resurrection . Hector was slain , Socrates condemned , Caesar assassinated , Dante banished ; Charles I executed ; Napoleon exiled ; Christ crucified ; yet a second Ilium more mighty than the first returned in triumph to the Achaian shores when the Greeks were scattered , Socrates taught again in Plato ; when the conspirators had perished by violence , Caesar revived triumphant in Augustus ; though Dante died in exile , broken-hearted , his countrymen a century afterwards came and begged back his body from the strangers , and the strangers would not give it up ; when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marston Moor ; though the Bourbons are banished , Napoleon reigns still in the son of Louis ; though the Jews are outcasts from Jerusalem , Christ crucified hath risen from the dead and sitteth on the right hand of God in the glory of the Father ! Then the history of the world teaches us that , in whatever form , on whatever day , and by  | whatever means , President Davis , clothed in the youth of an eternal principle , shall have his Resurrection too . His term is immortality ! They who have ears to hear , may hear the Spirit of God saying unto the angel of our political church , as plainly as in Patmos to the Angel of the Church of Smyrna : " Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer . Behold the Devil shall cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried ; and ye shall have tribulation ten periods . Be thou faithful unto death , and I will give thee a crown of life !
