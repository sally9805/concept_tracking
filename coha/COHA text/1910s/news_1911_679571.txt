txt An electric storm of unusual energy and brilliancy from the northwest hit New York at 10 o'clock last night , and before it had ceased driving holiday crowds to shelter and upsetting traffic another storm , just as intense , swept across the city from the south , causing death and widespread damage . Just as the twelve large tents in the five-block inclosure at Parsons and Franconia Avenues , Flushing , where the Flushing Society Circus has been holding forth since Wednesday night , for the benefit of the Flushing Hospital , were crowded to their capacity with several thousand men , women , and children , in ' eluding the best-known people in Flushing , the storm burst with a brilliant electrical display and roars of thunder , followed almost immediately by a tornado of wind end rain . In less than three minutes after the breaking of the storm the wind had lifted every tent , blown the canvas walls ana roofs down , and buried most of the thousands present beneath them in pitchy darkness . In the midst of the noise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children came crashes of falling trees and the rending of canvas . The cries of animals , imprisoned in the fallen tents , mingled with the confusion , making the din indescribable . While the storm roared around the wrecked circus tents all telephone service was broken off and all trolley service on the New " York &; Queens County electric line , passing the entrance at Parsons Avenue , was stopped , making it impossible for aid to reach . the squirming mass of humanity struggl'ng under tilts heavy tents . In the centre of the confusion , in the large hippodrome tent , where alone some 2,000 persons had been housed , Squadron A and a company of Boy Scouts had been performing when the storm broke . The horses of the squadron stampeded under the fallen tent , one of them crashing over the Boy Scouts as , equally blind and panic-stricken , they stumbled in the darkness under the horses ' legs and over each other .

In the main circus tent , just next to the hippodrome tent , where 3,000 persons had been crowded when the storm broke , three large elephants , lent by the Hippodrome I for the occasion , were thrown into panic , and struggled with frightened trumpetings under the fallen ' tent . it was all their keepers could do to confine their stampede to what they believed to be the centre of the tent , while the spectators plunged to the edges of the inclosure and fought their way out under the canvas sides . From the fallen Hippodrome tent and from every booth  --  all of which were either blown away bodily or blown on the spectators  --  men , women , and children fought their way out into the storm . There their panic grew , for in the noise and uproar and brilliant flashes of lightni'ig they did not know where to turn .

Lawrence and Johnson , who had been the official physicians on the circus grounds , could do to attend the bruised and injured , and to revive the women who were brought into the hospital . Everywhere in the hospital and the surrounding grounds mothers were clamoring for their children and children for their parents , lost in the darkness and storm . 4 , Wild Boys " Shared the Panic .

The boys , who were grunting and squealing and roaring in play when the storm broke out , roared t nd screamed in good earnest a moment later , while the roof of the ten was blown from over them and went soaring away , leaving them caged and terrified amid a trernerdous downpour of rain and te:rifie din . It was nearlwy half an hour before the last of the little fellows had been rescued from his cage . Many of them were carried out fainting . One company of refugees was taken to the hospital under the escort of James J. Corbett , who had been the feature of one of the side shows . Corbett at the outset , when the walls of his tent fell , burying 600 , Spectators , managed to calm them , ? assuring all in the place that he would see them to a place of safety if only they would " keep their heads. - Their confidence in the prowess of the ex-champion saved them from injury .

None of them ups thought to be dangerously hurt , however . The company of Boy Scouts , who had made their headquarters day and night In their tent , were left without shelter for the night when the tent was blown down .

There were thousands of dollars ' worth of fancy ' wares in the World 's Fair tent alone , and this , like all the other tents , was blown away and its contents scattered to the wind  --  little of them to be recovered afterward . Clarence M.

In the darkness that came suddenly 12,000 men , women , and children struggled in a panic to find their way to the exits . They found the surface cars stopped , and a mad scramble through bushes and over unfamiliar country in the search of shelter followed . The storm tied up the , surface cars on laroadway for fifteen minutes , as it was found necessary to cut off the current . So much water was driven into the SubWay through the open kiosks and the addewalk ventilator screens that for a time it was feared the tunnel would- be lflooded at the end of son-le of the inclines to such a depth as to interfere with the ' traffic .

A terrific crash of thunder followed , and then some one shouted that the electric power house just north of the scenic railroad had been struck . For about three minutes the crowd in the darkness good-naturedly listened to the attendants shouting that there was no danger . Then came the rain in sheets , and with it the wind , that came tearing ' across country out of the northwest . A child cried out in terror , and that cry seemed to move the people to sudden : movement , The rush for places of shelter soon became a stampede . The electric Mashes fortunately served to keep the , crdwd moving in the general direction ' Where the trolley cars were waiting .

After a delay they got lanterns lit and brought ladders . These were put up , and those In the stalled cars climbed or were carried to the ground . As the park emptied there was a desperate fight to get places in the waiting trolley cars . The few cars waiting soon to more than standing . room only . Those repulsed from the cars were forced either to stand in the drenching tain or to stumble off in the darkness in search pf shelter . Many of them were women carrying babies or dragging drenched and terror-stricken children by the arms . /t was a half hour before the cars began to run , and the hysterical , battered , soaked crowd to reach the ferry and crowd the ferryboats coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island was taken unawares by the storm .

The temporary structures erected on the fire site began to go . The tents went first , and then as the flimsy frame structures began rattling down board by board there was a general desire on the part of those - within to cross Surf Avenue and get under more substantial structures . an Ferrari 's Animal Show , playing un'der canvas , ** had just finished an act with a group of lions , when the storm began tearing at the tent stays . The animals were forced back in their , cages . Then the whole canvas structure , ' the roof flapping and tearing and the side , wall whipping and staggering , began to go .

Men and women fought for the exits or climbed through the windows , but , so far as could be learned , no one was seriously injured . Outside it was raining in torrents , and while some sought shelter in near-by houses , most of the frightened passengers crowded under the roof of the Parkville station .

He ran to the building , and assisted in quieting some of the more excitable tenants , who wanted to cart their houseld belongings out into the rain .
