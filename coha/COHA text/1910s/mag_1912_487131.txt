Science " The New Book of Golf " is among Long -- mans , Green &; Co. ' s announcements . It con-sista of contributions from various hands and is edited by Horace G Hutchinson The day of the elephant folio has pass-. - ed , but the portfolio still persists , as in the work before us , " Studies of Birdlife in - Uganda " ( London : John Bale , Sons , &; Danielsson ) . It has little to recommend - it except as an edition-de-lure presentation work , and its - authors , R. A. L. and V. , G. L. van Someren , would have been wiser to publish their pictures in some other form They have selected twenty-five photographs of wild birds and have beautifully reproduced them as enlarged photogravures 12x16 inches in size The subjects include woodpeckers , herons , darters , chats , shrikes , ? and kingfishers , all excellent but not remarkable . Five or six are mere duplicates showing the bird in slightly different pose , and a number have lost greatly in the process of enlargement . The plates are marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refer to a printed list Here , however , only very indefinite names are given , such as " Sandpiper at Nest , " " Cormorants on Trees , " which necessitates still further search through an eighteen-page text in which the confusion is accentuated by omission of the plate numbers The scientific value which the authors claim for their pictures would be more real if these were differently set forth . We fail to discover the " darkest secrets " which the writers have " wrested from Nature ! ' George A. Lindsay has made an interesting summary of annual rainfall and temperature in the United States . Twenty-eight manuscript maps , covering the fourteen years 1891-1904 , inclusive , were obtained from the office of the Weather Bureau of Washington Half of these indicated the precipitation in inches per year , and the other fourteen the mean annual temperature The total rainfall in cubic miles falling upon the State of Missouri during ten years , was within 2 per cent . equal to the discharge of the Mississippi River at St Louis during that interval , So it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or snow never reaches the sea through the medium of drainage , but is evaporated from the land If all precipitation went into rivers , and should be conducted back to the sea , we should have enormous streams of water which would entirely dwarf our present ones . After the precipitation for each State had been computed , the amounts were summed up in five districts ; the Northeast , the Southeast , the North Central , the South Central , and the Western In 1896 the total rainfall in the Northeast section was 98.9 cubic miles ; in tke Southeast , 199.7 , in the North Central , 363 ; in the South Central , 308.8 , and in the Western , 326 , making a total for the United States of 1.296 4 cubic miles With fourteen years taken as a basis , the average annual temperature of the United States , excluding the outlying parts , is 52 9 degrees F , the annual precipitation 1,308 cubic miles Frequent attempts to show a periodic variation of the temperature and rainfall have been made , and to connect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spots Whilethere seems a tendency , especially in the first part of the fourteen years , for a minimum of temperature and rainfall to occur at a maximum of sun spots , the latter part of the Period embraced is erratic in both the temperature and precipitation curves The fluctuation is a large fraction of the general periodic change which coincides fairly well with the sun-spot period . The most that may be said is that there are not enough data , or perhaps , better , not enough work has been done on the vast amount of data already accumulated , to show with any certainty , or even probability , that any celestial phenomena govern the variation of ' temperature and precipitation from year to year The remarkable thing is that the yearly variation is so small , considering the great storms and great variations of temperature extending over short periods . This very uniformity is perhaps more wonderful than the discovery of some celestial cause for the variation . The Life of the Plant , " by Professor Timiriazeff , of Moscow , has been agreeably translated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripe thought of an exceptional man , the book may be read by the intelligent farmer with much profit . Recognized as the foundation of agriculture , horticulture , and forestry , the study of the physiology of plants presents to the general reader topics of absorbing interest . Professor Timiriazeff shows what the plant takes from soil and air , the influence of warmth and light upon it , how it converts the absolutely useless into those materials which nourish man and the rest of the animal world , how the green plant stands between man and starvation . When all this becomes generally known and applied , larger crops and diminishing danger of a hungry world will result . Dr. George Montgomery Tuttle , one of the best-known gynecologists in this country , died last week in New York , at the age of fifty-six . After graduating from Yale in 1877 , and in 1880 from the College of Physicians and Surgeons , he began an apprenticeship at the hoepitals in New York , and from 1884 until the time of his death was attending gynecologist at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
