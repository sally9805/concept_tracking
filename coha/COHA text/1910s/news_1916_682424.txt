txt For a Law Against Hawkers . A little baby suffering all night with its teeth , and perhaps the heat , falls into a troubled sleep , and Its tired mother seeks a little rest . A stentorian voice calling out various kinds of green groceries comes rasping down the street , and all thought of slumber is promptly banished by every one .
