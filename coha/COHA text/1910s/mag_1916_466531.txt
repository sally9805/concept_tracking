WO years ago , if any one had foretold that we should be engaged in a life-and-death strug-gle with the greatest military power in the world , and that Europe would be an armed camp bristling witfr all the latest inventions for the destruc-tion of human life , and that the fate of the world was in the balance. , he would have been considered a dreamer and false prophet , and yet , while life goes on apparently little changed in our insular security , the greatest tragedy in the world 's history is being enacted only a hundred miles from our shores . The possibility of a war with Germany was discussed only to be dismissed by this country , long habituated to peace or to only the small wars which from time to time broke out to remind us of the widening responsibilities of our great empire . Yet to-day the hitter struggle goes on and the issues are still uncertain , and we are paying the largest price and suffering the bitterest anguish in the toll of those who have fallen , fighting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baneful and horrible in its acts ? a tyranny of cruelty and oppression which almost makes that of the Middle Ages pale before its intensity and brutality . In England we are always optimistic , but when the stern reality that we must face the inevitable and fight for thefreedom so precious to us , we waited with breathless anxiety for the decision of the Government , and when it came it was received with the keenest acclamation . Our small army seemed like David fighting against Goliath , but it had to go and emulate and sustain the record of former English armies . It has always been affirmed that the hour supplies the man , and there never was a moment in the history of our country which so absolutely justified that saying . The army , small as it was , was there ? but who was to guide the counsels of the nations and direct and form the larger forces which would be necessary if the struggle were long and obstinate ? The country never hesitated in its choice , and the few days which elapsed before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the community at large , of agonizing anxiety and suspense . As soon as his appointment was announced the country with absolute confidence sternly faced the situation . It was a magnificent call to him , and a recognition of how thoroughly all his ife 's work had been appreciated . The tension of the ten days between the declaration of war and the curt announcement that the English army had been landed in France " without any accident or the loss of a single life " ? days of silence and anxiety , during which not one word was said by the press , and an impenetrable veil of mystery surrounded everything ? can never be described , but the information at last vouchsafed only increased the conviction that the man on whom the hopes of England rested had justified her choice . And so on through all the days of uncertainty , of almost disaster , the country never wavered ; and when Lord Kitchener made his appeal for men , again and again came the ready , heartfelt response generously- and magnificently to his call . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiastic acquiescence to so great a sacrifice as the one which his inspiration awoke among his countrymen . It was necessary ? he asked it , he called on them , and that was enough ? and they came in their millions . He created a new army in every sense of the word ? an army proud of the traditions of its predecessors , but a better and finer army than has ever fought in the history of the world an army educated as no army has ever been , drawn from the best of England 's sons , with high courage and conscious of the great responsibilities of its imperial heritage ? men who are soldiers not to fight from instinctive combativeness , but because they have an ideal before them , and because the freedom and liberty they enjoy arc too precious to be endangered or lost . To the outside world Lord Kitchener was something of a mystery ; they knew little of him personalty , he shunned publicity , he was not a seeker after popularity . Though he had few personal friends , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare . He was shy and reserved about the deep things of life , but a charming companion in ordinary ways ? very amusing and agreeable . He had a great sense of humor , and his rapid intuition gave him a wonderful insight into character , and he soon arrived at a just estimate of people , and of the motives of those with whom he came into contact . He did not make many new friends , and the people who knew him well , and with whom his holidays or hours of relaxation were passed , were confined to those he had known for many years . He always impressed one with a deep sense of decency in conversation and conduct ; one felt in talking to him how impossible it would be to drift into the easy-goingdiscussion of questions and problems of our modern life , and it seemed impossible to imagine his taking a silent acquiescence in the jokes and insinuations which are not considered now extraordinary or unpleasant . He owed a good deal in life to the frankness of his character , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitated to tell home truths . In i89i , four years after we had evacuated the Sudan , the question arose who should be appointed Sirdar of the Egyptian army after Sir F. Grenfell 's resignation . The Cabinet , like all politicians at that time , strongly opposed the reoccupation of the Sudan ; and as the suspicion that Kitchener belonged to the forward party was considerably against him , it was generally thought that the appointment would be given to some other officer . Lord Salisbury , then Prime Minister , wished to make his acquaintance , and he invited him to dinner in Arlington Street . Afterward a conversation was overheard in which Colonel K. said to Lord S. , " It is no use , lord S. ; we have got to get back to Khartoum ; it 's for you to say when , and for me to find the means . " Most people thought such a speech would have sealed his fate , but Lord Salisbury realized he was dealing with a real man and insisted on his appointment , and he ever afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the climate of Suakim was , and the five years he passed there involved the greatest patience and self-denial . Suakim is one of the hottest places on earth ; for months the plague of flies which reign there make life almost unbearable ? and they have to be swept off the plate be- , tween each mouthful . Lord Kitchener 's strength lay in the fact that his views broadened as he wenton in life . Aslong ashe was confined to Egypt and had to carry out his task with the minimum of force and expenditure , he was careful even to penuriousness , and his subordinates groaned under his exacting economy ; but he was justified in his care by the wonderful development of the country devolving from his unsparing activity . When he went to South Africa with a great staff and unlimited funds , he took a new departure . He worked himself unceasingly , and exacted the same from those around him , but he recognized inevitable limitations and was most considerate . It has always been accepted as a fact that Lord K. was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as another . His principal friends were undoubtedly men , but he had a real regard and friendship for a few women , and they on their part recognized and reciprocated the chivalrous attitude he adopted toward them . His profession and career was what he lived for , and they filled his life , and as his responsibilities and power increased he thought of nothing else ; every other consideration w a s subordinated to whatever task he had undertaken . The fact that he had only bachelors on his staff gave color to the story . He did not think that a soldier on active service should be married , because no one with home ties and responsibilities could fail to have anxieties which might prevent his exclusive devotion being given to his profession ; but though one of his staff disregarded the edict , and Lord Kitchener regretted it , it made no difference either to the confidence he continued to give him , or in the whole-hearted service he gave to his chief . He inspired all those who served him with a passion for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with the same untiring energy and ceaseless activity . I do not think he ever had an idle moment in his day , and whileon his travels and long journeys he was always occupied and always absorbed in some subject , and he inspired his staff in a like manner . One of his staff wrote from the Red Sea , in 19oz , on Lord K. 's journey to India to take up the post of commander-in-chief . As full of energy as ever , Lord K. begins the day by working at Hindustani for 13 ? hours before breakfast in the morning and has another go between breakfast and lunch . He walks about with the book in his pocket all day and is continually firing off something he has learned and is very proud of his progress . We have had a tremendous morning 's work unpacking old cases of plate and silver that have been lying at the Bank for 6 or 7 years , and for the last two days we have helped him to go through all his old despatch boxes and papers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous lot of the unimportant papers , and filed the remainder . his in the Red Sea , where the heat has been overpowering , but we shall he out of it to-night . A little later he writes : The Chief 's brain never can rest , and although I am sure since he has been in India he has brought about as many important reforms as previous Commanders-in-Chief have done in double or treble that time , besides devoting quite special attention to the French and Russian questions ? he has still not nearly enough of work to keep him properly occupied . He is also now personally engineering and superintending the new buildings at Snowden and the transformation of the old ones . He had taken a small house near Simla called Wild Flower Hall , where he went for week-ends , and while making it internally comfortable and homelike he devoted a certain amount of his time to laying out a garden , and spent as many hours of that short leisure up there as he could spare . This same writer continues : The Chief and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving Simla at 6.1s A.M. , and put in a tremendous day 's gardening , with only two breaks of y. ; hour each for breakfast and lunch . We had r6 coolies working under us , and we transplanted 17 good-sized trees , besides planting 21 large basket-loads of periwinkle and wild raspberries . I am sure he gets more out of these coolies in one day than any one else would in a month , and it is most awfully hard to get him to knock off work in the middle of the day . It is quite , useless , besides being very had policy ever to raise difficulties when he proposes tasks even bordering on the impossible , for he merely says , You will find you can do it , " and somehow or other one generally does . He had instinctively good taste and love of beauty , and he had some opportunities of carrying out his ideas in the many houses he had occupied in all parts of the world . When he went to India as commanderin-chief in 1903 , he found his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he remodeled the building and made additions which improved and made it one of the finest in India . The official allowance for repairs , etc. , was only Soo rupees , but , as one of his aides writes , His instinct for remodeling and improving is so grafted in him that sooner than not being able to carry out his schemes he does them at his own expense . His improvements here Simla have changed the house beyond all recognition , both as regards the exterior and the comfortable rooms which make one almost forget one is in India . Since I was last here he has built a magnificent library with wood paneling . carved fireplaces and ceilings , and plenty of places for china . The only thing that was missing were books , but since we arrived he has managed to collect over soo volumes . Above the library are four new bedrooms ; he has raised the roof over four feet so as to make the upper rooms higher . He has made a new staircase leading into the ballroom , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by building out over the valley , revetting the sides till they have become almost perpendicular ; at the end of the lawn you now have an almost sheer drop of 1,000 feet . Lord Kitchener 's journey to the Pamir and Chitral was full of incident and most successful , and the letters are full of his wonderful energy and untiring activity . The Ovis Poll had no desire to encounter the commander-in-chief , and left him in solitary possession of their country , through which it is needless to say we bear that he did the journey in and out in two days less than it was supposed possible to do it . We do over 5o miles a day . The general routine is Reveille 5 A.M. We start at 6 , but the Chief has never started later than 5.45 . The Chief has generally done breakfast before any one else turns up and gets into camp hours before any one else . The same untiring energy characterized his crossing the Hindu-Kush , over the Takht Pass and the Daskt Glacier , 15,200 feet high , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the solemnity of Eastern ceremonial , and took part at once , on arriving , in a polo-match to make up the game , as the Yashis played six a side . The chief 's sidc was beaten , and , according to the custom of the tribe , the defeated side must dance before the victors . The chief got out of this duty with some difficulty by suggesting , as it appeared indispensable that some one should dance , that the conquerors should , which verdict they accepted . Some time later there came an unexpected cessation of Lord K. 's physical activities , for he broke his leg riding through a tunnel on his way back to Simla , and lay for some hours before assistance came . The treatment was long and very painful , and the enforced idleness which followed was very irksome to Lord Kitchener , for , beyond attending to the vast amount of routine business , he had every other occupation cut off . He had a huge almanac made and hung opposite his bed so that he could mark off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play bridge in the evening , and his staff who were unable to play set to work to make themselves fairly efficient in record quick time . Lord Kitchener , at his next visit to England , had to consult specialists about his kg , which gave him a great deal of trouble , and it was arranged that he should have two months to undergo treatment which would necessitate the resetting of the bone . When he was told that it was considered unwise to do anything to it , he was annoyed at finding out that the two months which it was supposed the treatment would require , and for which he had made arrangements , was no longer necessary and he had that amount of time at his disposal for which he had made no o t her provision . It was a real grievance to him having to find out how best he could dispose of it , which he finally did after a great deal of grumbling . One of the most interesting events of his time in India was the visit of the Amir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great success of the " week . " With the exception of three people , all the fifty-four guests were soldiers , a fact which appealed greatly to the Amir , who liked to be considered a soldier king . Lord Kitchener made a speech in which he said that the Amir had since his arrival in India shown such genuine interest in and such a masterly grasp of all military questions even of the most technical nature that it was not so much as a king but as a brother-in-arms that the British officers welcomed him that night . Lord Kitchener , with his insight into character and his knowledge of Easterners , appealed deeply to the Amir , who , in his reply , with deep emotion , let him-self go in a way his sirdars said they had never seen him do before . He said what a delight it had been to him to see the thirty thousand troops at the Runn on the previous day , and to notice how efficient they wereand how ready for service . Continuing , he said that he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training , but that even if he were looked on as a traitor to his country , he would , on his return to Afghanistan , never rest till he had introduced British training and methods to such a degree as to make his army worthy to fight shoulder to shoulder alongside the troops of his friends . He said much more which was never allowed to be published , and which was the most eloquent tribute to the deep impression the commander-in-chief had made on him in that short visit . A curious little touch of how much Lord Kitchener had impressed him is told by one of his staff , who was in one of the butts with the Amir during a great tiger-hunt at Gwalior , where he went to visit the Maharajah . He writes : I told him that the Chief had had a nasty fall at Poona , his horse tumbling down an embankment . He immediately asked fur a piece of paper and wrote a telegram of sym-pathy in Persian . He handed it to Sir Henry MacMahon and asked him to send it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English , but when he came to the sentence " to hear of your fall from your horse , " the Amir instantly corrected him , saying : " No , no . Not from your horse ? ccidi horse in Afghanistan ? big difference , " The same ceaseless activity characterized his work in Egypt , when he went there after failing to he appointed Viceroy of India , which most of his friends anticipated , and which he would have accepted . Perhaps Egypt was a disappointment after the wider sphere India presented , but nothing ever prevented him from doing what came to him to do and giving his best to it , When he returned there , the question of infant mortality and the unhygienic condition of Egyptian women during childbearing , from the neglect and ignorance of the most elementary measures , came under his observation , and he was deeply interested in devising means of providing medical treatment for them , and of training native women in midwifery and all that would conduce to improving the conditions under which they lived . He enlisted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Englishwomen in Egypt , and carried out a scheme which in itself was a wonderful example of what his interest and driving power could accomplish . These women whose help he enlisted could tell endless stories of the task he set them to do and his tacit refusal to listen to any difficulties that arose in carrying it out . A number of trained English nurses were despatched to Egypt and sent to different localities , where they gave training to a large number of native women in midwifery and kindred subjects . The scheme was a great success , and the benefit it has been to thousands of native women is indescribable , as regards both their general treatment and the care of themselves and their children at birth . Little was known about the subject in England , and much less about all that was done to mitigate the evil ; but it was a wonderful piece of administration , though perhaps not one that appealed specially to him ; and when some one , knowing what had been achieved , congratulated him on his success and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristic reply was : " I am told I have saved the lives of ten thousand babies . I suppose that is something to have done . ' At that time , only a fortnight before the prospect of war seemed possible , he was talking with the keenest interest of his return to Egypt and of what he had still to do there . There are incidents in life which leave lasting impressions , and one of a large dinner at Lord French 's about the same time , at which Lord K. , Lord Haldane , and others were present , comes to my mind ; probably no one there but those three men had an idea of the threatening cloud which broke in so short a time over England , and the important part two of them would take in it . Lord K. , as the world knows , was on the point of returning to Egypt ; in fact , he had started when he was recalled , almost on board the steamer at Dover . The two questions which moved the soul of the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part the country was going to take when it was realized that warwas inevitable , and , after that , who was to preside at the War Office . There might have been hesitation on the one point ; on the other there was none , and the silent , deep determination with which the people waited to be told that Lord Kitchener was to be Secretary of State for War can only be realized by those who went through those anxious days . There was never a doubt or hesitation in the mind of the country that Lord K. was the only person who could satisfy its requirements , and the acclamation with which the news flashed through the country when he was appointed Secretary of State for War was overwhelming , while those who were thrown into contact with him give a marvelous ac-count of the cool , rapid , and soldier-like i way in which he accepted the great position . He quickly installed himself at the War Office , even to sleeping there , so that he was ever at the call of his office , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gardens , close by , at his disposal . Later on the King offered him St. James 's Palace , and those neighbors who rose early enough saw him daily start off on his morning walk to his office , where he remained all day . Lord K. was not a well-known per-sonage in England . He had a small circle of intimate friends , but to the outside public he was the stern , simple soldier , a great martinet . In some ways that very isolation added to his power . To be popular with the crowd and the masses is the aim of most public persons , and in a democratic country like ours a friendly demeanor is the fashion of the moment , but that Lord K. never aimed ator wished for . To have a nickname which the country and press could adopt had become a habit , and was supposed to indicate a sympathy between men and their rulers ? and friendship between the leaders of political parties was also the rule , not the exception . Nearly all our great public men have enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone maintained all his life the distinction of bearing his great name unsullied by popular abbreviation , and in some ways Lord Kitchener , though he had his own name among his friends , was always spoken of as " Lord K. " by the proletariate . To the soldiers he was always " K. of K. , " and while the English army exists he will never be known by any other name . His influence was greatly augmented by the power and dignity of his silence and his well-known dislike of anything that appeared to appeal to the whim of the moment , which won the confidence of the country in a manner hardly understood or expected . To the crowd he was the silent , serious-looking soldier whose face seldom relaxed for them into the smile his friends knew so well ; but to the army he was the man who , when he undertook , " always came out top , " and the unbroken , victorious record of his career made him a military idol . The feeling of the army was also greatly influenced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his having had no accidents of birth or military connections to help him . He was a hard man , and he set almost impossible tasks for those who served him . He knew no fatigue himself , and he worked unceasingly ; he was a hard but a just taskmaster , and if he expected miracles of achievement , he asked no more than he knew from personal experience was possible . The tribute of the men and officers who worked with him in Egypt and South Africa were all alike in their testimony to his unfailing justice . You could not love him , but there was something about him that inspired a savage passion for him , and his army would have followed him to the gates of hell . Such are the words of an officer who had served for many years under him , from whose letter I quote . Perhaps during the last few months of his life , when his gigantic task was well-nigh accomplished , he looked forward to a release from the toils of office and the misunderstanding and the complications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , to the days when he could go to his muchcared-for home at Broome and finish the work which he had taken in hand there and illustration in some ways was a wonderful Illustration of the variety of his activities . He had bought an old , uncared-for estate and house with some possibilities , but in his hands he had built himself a home worthy in every respect to be his , and after transforming it he was filling it with all the treasures he had accumulated during his long and eventful life . He had always been a great collector , and though it would not be true to say he had made no mistakes , still he had learned discrimination as time went on , and his collection of plate , pictures , china , Eastern carpets and treasures was a most remarkable one . He had the courage to " weed it " out as he learned more , and he made latterly few mistakes . He was insatiable in his determination to possess anything he really valued , and he rarely lost it from any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His taste was really good , and any one who knows the cabinets which surround the walls ? father distinguished soldiers will realize that Lord K. , like the late King , accepted nothing unless it was in good taste . He had perhaps the finest collection of modern and old plate made during the last twenty-five years , and in doing so he broke down one of the most time-hallowed customs of his country . On the return of a distinguished Englishman from his official life or after any great public service he is always invited to visit the large towns of Great Britain , to receive the highest reward they can bestow ? an address of welcome and a gold casket containing the address and the parchment conferring the freedom of the city on him . Lord K. gave it to be understood that the gold casket did not appeal to him , and that a piece of plate which he could always associate with each town would be much more acceptable . His suggestion was at once adopted , and the substitute he received in the shape of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horror of forms and ceremonies , and only the knowledge that it would be ungracious ever reconciled him to the inevitable functions in which he had to participate . Lord Kitchener bore the hero-worship which was inevitable with great philosophy ; he did not let it interfere with his usual life , and in society , though he was 17- ' 6- ripandu , he only went where he knew he would not be bored and where he felt at home . He was in reality a shy man , and never really quite overcame this even in the days when he was one of the most prominent men in the world and had made the acquaintance of the greatest men in every part of the world . Those who knew him when he first came to London as Captain Kitchener well remember how silent and shy he was , and what an effort it was to him to go out into society ; and even later on , when he had achieved a reputation and an acknowledged position , it was very irksome to him , and he shunned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one occasion in the early ' nineties seeing him at a small dance where he had quite unexpectedly found himself , having come on from the Athenaeum Club where a dinner had been given to Lord Morley on his receiving the 0 . M. A crowd of young people insisted on his dancing the Lancers . He protested that he had never danced anything in his life , but he was dragged into the room and a partner found fur him ; he took it quite cheerfully , and was amused to realize how few of the dancers knew it better . No mention of Lord Kitchener , however slight , could pass over one fact in his life ? that devoted band of soldiers who served on his staff in Egypt , India , South Africa , and in England . They were a wonderful band , all of them able , capable , and first-rate soldiers , attached to their chief in a remarkable way and willing to do his bidding and serve him to their life 's end . There was no work too arduous or impossible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they did not joyfully carry nut . Hard and strenuous as it was , they loved their work ; they loved their chief , and the main object of their life was loyally and joyfully to carry uut his orders . It would be impossible to have given more whole-hearted , more enthusiastic VOL . CXXXIII. ? No. 797. - 62 service , and he inspired them with an almost superhuman enthusiasm . Some of them still survive , others have followed him into the land of silence . Watson Pasha still lives , and Maxwell , V.C. , to mourn their chief . Victor Brooke , one of the first English officers who died in France , Marker , and Hamilton have followed him ; and FitzGerald , who , after the long days of stress and struggle of the last two years , died as he would have chosen , by the side of his beloved master ; and he must have had the consolation , even in those terrible last moments , of knowing what he had been to Lord Kitchener and how he cared for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how deep were their feelings of affection and devotion to their master , and what wholehearted , loving service they gave him . The last two crowded years of Lord Kitchener 's life , full of their anxieties and responsibilities , had not changed him ; but though he had aged , and the constant strain had told on him . he had altered outwardly but little . The office life was irksome , and the want of exercise to a man of his active habits very trying , for he hardly ever left London except for an occasional week-end at Broome . His intended visit to Russia was not known , and , like so many of his visits to France and the army at the front , were only made public after his return . Those who saw him that last week and knew of his going , tell how he longed for the change and how eagerly he looked forward to his holiday . The last few months , with the controversies over conscription , had harassed him . He was not a keen believer in the conscript @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a voluntary army by the response he had received on his appeal to the manhood of England . There was a wonderful completion of the task he had undertaken in those last few days . He had raised his millions , and the country had accepted the inevitable imposition of compulsion , and with it that chapter of his life was finished . He had met the House of Commons , and , uncertain as the result of that conference was , like all he did , it was one of his greatest successes . He had no indecision when it was proposed to him that he should meet the Commons , and , as was always the case , the result was never in doubt . What passed has never been divulged , but he left an impression on the two hundred members who were present which was perhaps one of the best tributes ever paid him . After his farewell to the King , his last visit to Broome and to Sir John Jellicoe and the Grand Fleet , he set sail for the shore he never reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most perfect end of such a life ? a life full of high endeavor and completion . The service he had rendered his country by raising herarmies and foreseeing the probable duration of the war could not have been performed by any other living man . If , as his critics say , he depended too much on his own individual endeavors , he was not to be blamed when we read day by day of the glorious deeds of the armies he had created . The country staggered under the blow of his death , and one can never forget the silent grief and dismay of that dreadful day with its horrible tragedy . The grief was universal and personal , and the tributes to his work and memory were spoken from the heart by the great leaders of both parties . No more touching and pathetic tribute was ever said than the speech made by Lord Derby in the House of Lords on the resolution in reference to his death . There is not one word to be altered from beginning to end , but the concluding words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Kitchener said good-by to the nation at a moment when he left the whole of the machinery of the great armies that he had created in running order , and when it only required skilled engineers to keep going his work . It was really as if Providence in its wisdom had given him the rest he never would have given to himself . With the memory of a great naval battle fresh in our minds we must all realize how rich a harvest of death the sea has reaped . We in these islands from time immemorial had paid a heavy toll to the sea for our insular security , but , speaking as the friend of a friend . I can say that the sea never executed a heavier toll than when Lord Kitchener , coffined in a British man-of-war , passed to the Great Beyond
