STATUTORY LAW . Popular Law Making . By Frederic Jessup Stimson . New York : Charles Scribner 's Sons . $2.50 net . This book attempts to give a summary of the statutory law in the United States on property , and on personal , racial , and political rights ; it also reviews the corporation , labor , pure food , and Trust legislation . The author , while regretting the tendency to pass statutes on every conceivable subject , even when , according to him , it would be covered much better by application of the principles of the common law , recognizes that at the present time , to the average man , " statutes have assumed the main bulk of the concept of law as we formulate it to ourselves . " His object , therefore , is to show both what has been accomplished by law-making in the past and what is now being adopted or even proposed , and in this manner to give some idea of the problems of the times which are confronting legislation to-day . Although the primary object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , the book is not merely a dry enumeration . Mr. Stimson undertakes to criticise as well , not hesitating at times to express harsh censure , as when he justly condemns the freakish legislation which so often disgraces our statute books , and the slovenly way in which so many of our laws are drawn Not all the views held by the author will , to be sure , meet with assent . His absolute condemnation of the tendency to confer power on commissions and of the regulation and recognition of political parties seems to run counter to the general trend of political opinion . Nor should the Sherman Act be repudiated because it dispenses with a jury and throws upon the court " the burden of determining a complicated and voluminous mass of fact . " The very circumstance that the facts to be determined are complicated and voluminous would justify the exclusion of the jury , and our ancestors would not have been shocked at this so much as the author would have us believe . So it may well be doubted ( and the decision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to justify such doubt ) whether the maxim that no one shall be compelled to incriminate himself is at the present time of such fundamental importance that its abolition would result in the destruction of our entire social structure . Exception might , also , be taken to the view that the notion of law as a custom is purely Teutonic . Commentators like Savigny and the historical school in general have shown how great a part customary law played in the development of Roman law . In France , up to the time of the promulgation of the Civil Code , the law of a great part of the country was custom . ary in its nature . The thought which underlies the book and which is expressed on numerous occasions is the necessity of holding fast to the fundamental principles of the common law in regulating the labor and Trust problems , and its great superiority , as to all matters relating to personal and political liberty , to the Continental system . A careful reading of the chapter in which the author reviews the English statutes which preceded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law as it was adopted in this country , will justify the doubt whether this mass of crude and undigested legislation , enacted at a time when social and economic conditions were completely different from those existing now , is as safe a guide for the regulation of our complex business relations as the author thinks . The same may be said of the great superiority claimed for the common law in matters relating to personal liberty or safeguarding the individual against abuse of power of public officials . The author refers , for instance , to the rule that , under common law , labor contracts can never be specifically enforced , and contrasts this with the law of Continental Europe as he understands it . In the first place , it may be said that , while contracts for personal labor are not specifically enforced , in many cases virtually the same object is attained by enjoining the defendant from working for anybody else But a complete answer is that the doctrine of specific performance is entirely unknown , at least to French law ; that in it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act " is fundamental , and that damages are the only remedy where any contract is broken . He refers again and again , in support of his view , to the right given by the common law to sue public officials , and claims that such liability is as good as unknown to any other system . The principle is not unknown either in France or Germany , and has been greatly extended in the former country under the present Republican regime . In this country and England such remedy , which is generally of doubtful practical value , is the only one available to the party aggrieved ; the state itself can not be sued , even on its contracts , and is not responsible for the acts of its officials unless there is an express statute to the contrary . This principle has been extended so as to apply to cities or other subordinate political divisions when they act in a governmental capacity . - Under this rule a person run over by an ambulance of the Health Department , or injured in an elevator controlled by the Police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a poor consolation to him to be told that he is at liberty to bring an action against the ambulance driver or the person operating the elevator . The contrary rule prevails under the Continental system . In France , for instance , the state is liable like any other employer , and the only question is whether the action is to be brought before the ordinary or administrative courts . A striking application of this principle occurred recently in Holland , where the owners of gambling houses , which were closed by executive order and without legal process , at once brought an action for damages against the state , and won their suit . But while we may differ with the author on these and many other points , there can be no question of the value of his work ; he certainly has attained his object to make suggestions which will awaken the interest of his readers to the importance of the subject . In the Footprints of Heine . By Henry Janes Forman . With illustrations by Walter King Stone . Boston : Houghton Mifflin Co. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holiday tramp through the Harz depends upon its youthful and ingenuous quality . People were glad to take up with the author . Waiters , innkeepers , and strolling artisans told him ghost and fairy stories . On the top of the Bracken , in lieu of a Walpurgis night , he enjoyed a tolerable substitute in the kneipe of a university corps . There also intervened a Fraiilein with most amiable parents . Mr. Forman 's hazards of the road are not exciting in themselves , and he refrains from adding rhetorical allurements , to a plain tale . He does you scenery with a certain deftness , but where he is most successful is in enjoying and conveying the sense of that gracious Gemdthlichkeit which persists in the unprussian ized remnant of old Germany . Those who love this most specific of German qualities will find Mr. Forman an excellent travelling companion , always tactful and quietly humorous , more inclined to hint than to expatiate . Note in this regard the entrance of the Fraiilein . A diligence is standing in the inn court of Heiligenstock as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knapsack the lady in the mail-coach suddenly leaned forward to the window , and with that fleeting glance I had of her high-bred , delicate face I experienced the curious sense of vague familiarity we sometimes have on meeting strangers . Either I had seen her or met her before , or something within me leaped to meet her now . But in a moment she was again hidden in the obscurity of . the coach . The postillions had finished their repast and with horsehair plumes waving in the breeze they clambered up to the box . The coach was a public conveyance , and going to Klausthal , my destination . I had a quick impulse to take passage in it and thus become the travelling companion of the beautiful lady . But conscience bred of New England education reminded me that my plan was to walk . Consideration for the lady did the rest . The coach rolled away and I remained at the table , like the bridegroom in Lochinvar , dangling " bonnet and plume , " and hoping that we might meet again . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title , it has substantial merits of its own . From the fustian and pretentiousness that infect its genre it is refreshingly free . Interpretations of Horace . By the late William Medley . Edited by John Green Skemp and George Watson Mac-alpine . New York : Henry Frowde . Lovers of Horace will enjoy this book and find it profitable . In it , each beautifully printed ? and followed by a commentary which deserves the name of interpretation it bears , are nineteen of the best odes . There is none of the usual excess baggage of learning that ( perhaps necessarily ) cumbers text-books of Horace . The author ? of the interpretations takes for granted the desirable syntactical , linguistic , and other special knowledge , and treats his literature in true humanistic fashion . Each interpretation , after an apt parallel passage or poem , begins with a paragraph in appreciation of the whole , and is then continued in a running exposition consisting sometimes of comment ; sometimes of paraphrase , and sometimes of translation , which is everywhere sane , sympathetic , and illuminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal interpretation . To use the interpreter 's own words : " Much of these informal lectures may be fitly described as the lecturer 's thinking aloud with his class . " It is full of life and vigor , and makes the reader feel as if he were sitting under a teacher with broad knowledge of the best in life and letters . The interpreter was professor in a denominational college which trains for the ministry , and scriptural parallels are used with fine effect ; but his Christianity never interferes with a just appreciation of the pagan poet 's most pagan ideas , and the poems here collected range from the Pyrrha ode to Delicta majoram immeritus hues . If the Horace of the interpretations is a trifle more dignified and austore than the Horace of popular imagination as fixed by Eugene Field , it is because Horace was really possessed of austerity to the point of being himself something of a preacher , and his interpreter 's appreciations are those of a scholarly mind . A quotation or two from the work will communicate its flavor . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A Roman Lady Vere de Vere " : Verses 1-13 : The tone is given to the picture and the interpretation suggested , sharply and at once , by the first word , guts , repeated in the cui of verse four . Each word stings : " Who . . . for whom ? " There have been many ; there will be more ; who is it now ? Then she descends from her chamber to the gratum antrum  --  not " some pleasant cave , " as Milton has it , but the pleasant grotto attached to a lordly house . It is a cool and shady nook , with its statues of Venus , its fountain , and its ferns . GI-atm , it is in itself , but yet more for its sweet associations , in the wooer 's mind , with blissful meetings . Here often of late has he been received . Again , from Parcus deorum , entitled " Conversion " : But see , here is a day serene ; the sky is clear , purism. ; no veil of cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crash from that pure sky , and the flame cleaves the air . . . . To this trembling soul the thunder storm out of a clear sky is a veritable theophany : The voice of the Lord is upon the waters ; The God of Glory thundereth , Even the Lord upon many waters . The voice of the Lord is powerful ; The voice of the Lord is full of majesty . The voice of the Lord cleaveth the flames of fire . It is Jehovah himself who speaks ; the thunder is His voice . It is characteristic of the interpreter that in this poem he sees , not the record of an experience of the poet himself , nor a bit of atheistic banter , but a type ? of experience  --  the conversion of an Epicurean . The character of these interpretations will be better appreciated after a reading of the editor 's introduction .

He was a man of deep personal quality as well as broad and sound scholarship . Rarely to a dead scholar and teacher is accorded the high and enthusiastic praise here given . The impression left by the introducLon adds to and explains that left by the interpretations ; one enjoys the disciples ' glowing exposition of the teacher 's character as much as the teacher 's glowing interpretation of Horace , and understands each better for having read the other The book ought to stimulate good literary teaching and editing of Horace .

Time and Free Will : 4n Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness . By Henri Bergson . Authorized translation by P. L. Pogson . New York : The Macmillan Co. $2.75 net . Not the least of the services rendered to Anglo-American philosophy by William James consisted in his employment of his great influence to draw attention to that movement of French thought of which M. Bergson is the best-known representative  --  a movement having close affinities with James 's own doctrines , yet developed in an entirely distinctive way . A school so much talked about at home was doubtless certain , sooner or later , to gain a hearing abroad ; but its vogue among us has unquestionably been much accelerated by its finding as one of its earliest champions so eminent a figure and so vigorous a fighter as Professor James . To the interest which he aroused must in large part be ascribed the zeal of publishers this year to bring out translations of Bergson ; it appears that all three of this philosopher 's principal writings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present volume is a rendering of the latest edition of Berg-son 's earliest work , his these de doetorat , published first in 1889 under the less expressive title of " Essai sur les donnees immediates de la conscience . " The English title , it is true , indicates the subject-matter of only two of the three chapters composing the volume . But those chapters are the important part of the book ; the brief first chapter , on the notion of intensity as applied to mental states , though not unrelated to the principal theme , is rather loosely related , and scarcely essential to the argument . The rest of the volume , dealing with the problem of freedom in the light of the conception of " real duration " as a unique characteristic of inner states , constitutes an extremely lucid presentation of the Jade mere of Bergson 's entire philosophy . What is called Bergsonism is not entirely a doctrine without recognizable ancestry . The germ of some of it is discernible in an important little book , " De la contingence des lois de la @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Boole Normale , Emile Boutroux , who has recently visited America . Some of it also may be found  --  combined with much else  --  in the philosophy of a notable French thinker , too little lead outside of France , Renouvier , who exercised likewise a considerable influence upon the formation of James 's metaphysical ideas . Bergson is very far from merely repeating doctrines of these older contemporaries of his ; but he represents the same general tendency of French thought , and part of his work has consisted in developing further certain conceptions found in one or the other , or in disengaging these conceptions from their former contexts to recombine them with one or two other familiar motives of nineteenth-century speculation . Yet the outcome of this process has as high a degree of originality as is often found in philosophical reasonings ; and the principal argument of " Time and Free Will " may be regarded as an essentially novel contribution to metaphysics . Time , as Kant had observed , is " the form of inner experience , " as space is of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contended  --  giving up as barren and incomprehensible Kant 's supra-temporal ego behind both series of phenomena  --  properly means that succession and duration and becoming are of the very essence of the reality that is inwardly and directly known to us . But precisely what , Bergson asks , is the nature of our time-consciousness , and what is its relation to our spatial imagery ? The Cubtle analysis which he bringp to bear upon this question leads him to the conclusion that there is in mankind a strong disposition to think time under forms borrowed from , and properly applicable only to , space , to assimilate the idea of duration to that of extension ; and this , he finds , is the source of a host of errors in philosophy , including the error of determinism . All the perplexities of the ancient puzzle of the freedom of the will " come back , without our suspecting it , to the following question : ' Can time be adequately represented by space ' ? " Berg-son 's answer is a decided " No . " Time past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ categories alien to its original nature ; but time in actual flow has a nature unique and irreducible Space we think of in terms of quantity , and as having all its points simultaneous with one another and external to one another , their true relations inter s ? ; being unmodified by change . We can ideally pass through it in any direction , can repeat the same course , can come back to the same point . Now our ideas of causal uniformity  --  derived largely from our experience of physical objects in space  --  though they refer to temporal sequences , are yet , so to say , woven upon a spatial warp . By " the same cause " we mean a set of conditions to which we can revert , which can be reconstituted without being significantly modified by the mere lapse of time . But time itself ? the pure duration of inner experience ? is , says Bergson , not a homogeneous and measurable quantity at all ; it is , moreover , a one-directional flow whose successive moments imperceptibly inter-penetrate , which permits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later phase , merely because it is later , must be different from and incommensurable with every earlier one . Thus our temporal inner life is a kind of existence to which the principle that " the same cause must always be followed by the same effect " is irrelevant , since the required " sameness " can there never be wholly realized . Future time , again , is not , to one actually involved in the temporal process , " contained in " present or past ; and to say that the entire content of the future is completely preformed in , the present or past , that With earth 's first clay they did the last map knead , is simply to treat succession as if it were simultaneity , to abandon the point of view of real temporal experience , where the future always appears as in process of production through and part- , ly by means of the present . The easy triumph of the old determinist arguments over the old freedomist arguments was due , Bergson holds , to the , failure of the freedomist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways of thinking reality . Both parties , for example , " pictured the deliberation preceding choice under the form of an oscillation in space , while it really consists in a dynamic process in which the self and its motives , like-real living beings , are in a constant state of becoming . " These reasonings can hardly be justly expounded , and they certainly can not be-adequately discussed , in brief compass . It may be remarked , however , that in his determination to make a complete severance between the temporal and the spatial categories , Bergson goes so far - as to defeat his own purpose . To say that duration is pure quality with no . quantitative aspect , and that its moments , though successive , are " without reciprocal externality , " is itself a way of reducing time to simultaneity . Berg- - son 's pages on this point at times singularly resemble the arguments by which Professor Royce has ingeniously-sought to show that experience as a , whole  --  the " Absolute Experience " ? must be timeless . The translation is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathetic preface by the translator and an admirably comprehensive bibliography of articles about Bergson 's philosophy in several languages . The first presentation of this important contemporary to our public has been so well done that all readers of the book must lament the sudden death of the young Oxford scholar to whom we owe the service . Medieevai Italy . By Prof. Pasquale Villari . Translated by Costanza Hulton . New York : Charles Scribner 's Sons . $3.75 net . The coronation of Charlemagne , the last event treated in " The Barbarian Invasions of Italy , " forms the point of departure in Professor Villari 's new work , which follows the fortunes of the peninsula to the time of the death of Henry VII . The book is written for the general reader , and offers a straightforward narrative , free from controversy and show of erudition , and based on thorough knowledge of the sources and on criticism of the results of modern investigation The whole territory is constantly held in view . Southern Italy and Sicily are accorded  --  for the first time in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The orderly-control of the many intereelated series of events is admirable . The book grows in interest and value toward the end The concluding chapters clarify notably the events and the personalities of the late thirteenth century . Professor Villari deals almost exclusively with men and arms . The whole period , in his presentation , Is dominated by individual men , builders of states that disintegrate at the builder 's death , politicians - whose policies lapse into oblivion when the controlling mind is gone . Institutions appear externally continuous , but devoid- of vital growth ; Papacy and Empire hold power or sink into insignificance according as the men who wear the tiara or the iron crown are strong or weak . One could wish that more attention had been paid to non-military matters . The intellectual and religious life of the Middle Ages , the condition of the people , the development of commerce , even matters of such political importance as the feudal system and the conflict of the investiture , are treated hurriedly and with far less clearness than the general reader has a right to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franciscan orders ( p. 267 ) they are differentiated only as being respectively bloodthirsty and tenderhearted . The implication ( p. 266 ) that the " De imitatione Christi " was written in the time of St. Francis is unfortunate Dante 's " De monarchia , " treated ( p. 368 ) as of the time of the descent of Henry VII into Italy , was almost ' certainly not written before the last years of Dante 's life . The comparison of Pope and Emperor to sun and moon , attributed ( p. 259 ) to Innocent III , goes back at least to Gregory VII . The translation has the prime virtue of accuracy . The only serious error is an arrangement of relative clauses which attributes to Sylvester II instead of to Otho III denial of the authenticity of the Donation of Constantine ( p. 114 ) .

The Italian phrases on pp. 5 and 158 have no textual value , and should have been translated . The difficult matter of the anglicization of proper names is in general well-handled .

The typesetter is presumably responsible for the dates " 1909 " ( instead of 1009 ) on p. 130 , and for " 1,506 " and " 1,528 " on p. 348 , for " sunt " instead of wain on p. 198 , and for " civitatis " instead of eivitas on p. 341 .

It is distinctly refreshing , too , because of the angle from which it was written . The author of these memoirs did not go to Samoa to hang upon the lips of Tusitala As shopkeeper , dealer in real estate , local politician , and chairman of the Board of Works he was  --  is still  --  in the island on his own account . His plain , unvarnished tale proceeds from an interest which was rather neighborly than literary  --  we infer from some passing remarks that he is unacquainted with his neighbor 's essay on Burns . Their relations , none the less , as the " Vailima Letters " and this book bear witness , were of the friendliest intimacy . They exchanged yarns and discussed local celebrities together , " generally in the evenings , as we sat in our pajamas on the balcony " ; they conspired together against the German president of the municipal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Footnote to History " ; and Moors says , with a suggestion of pleasure in the reminiscence , that at one time Stevenson owed him above twelve thousand dollars . These are vital points of contact ; Moors 's opinion of his friend should be of some weight . He finds it hard to believe in the canonized Stevenson proclaimed in the pulpits . The man he knew went to church only from deference to his mother , regarded the prayers at Vailima as something of a nuisance , was more himself in a paper-chase than in a Sunday-school on the Lord 's day , looked upon the wine when it was red in the Tivoli Hotel , and was " surprised more than once in Bohemia " ? whatever that may mean . Moors therefore cites with manifest delight the following brief but pointed epistle : My dear Moors I hope to get down to-day , but the weather does not yet seem bordered up . We had a hell of a time yesterday ; I wish the man who invented open eaves had been with us ? I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever R. L. S. All that this some-what trivial testimony amounts to is that Stevenson , being neither a moral , intellectual , or social snob , was able to mix familiarly with all sorts of men on their own ground , and make them feel that he was no better than they. , The defect of the critics who , like the late W. E. Henley , insist on the " real Stevenson " is their unwillingness to recognize his many-sidedness  --  their failure to understand that a man of letters may give to the wide world some sincere and precious part of himself which he can not give to his nearest friends . The most touching passage in this book is the chapter entitled " A Plan that Failed . " Mr. Moors writes of the Political troubles in Samoa from an inside view , but of the ladies at Vailima , we trust , from the outside . He could not help feeling that they were a little queer : for example , " the whole family ? I except Stevenson 's mother  --  worshipped at the shrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse , he thought , there was too much literary collaboration at Vailima . He felt a certain jealousy of the influence exerted by the women over the master of the house ! And with the talent of a conspirator he bought a little island , and in 1893 secretly proposed to carry Stevenson off where he might work undisturbed and " accomplish something worth attempt-ing " ? The important gziestion was how to keep the ladles away from our island retreat , but he said he would manage it somehow . Meanwhile , I had myself visited Nassau , and had set a party of islanders to work . . . . Stevenson , longing for the peace and quiet of such a spot , evinced a lively interest in my account of these labors ; and when we left the tower where Moors had unfolded the plot and rejoined our friends we drank a quiet toast to our future happiness in Elysian fields . This little dream of a literary paradise freed from the annoyances of Eve and her daughters was abruptly terminated by death . One may regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious additional testimony pointing to that " other Stevenson " with the singular power of exciting personal devotion frequently verging on sheer idolatry.
