txt The Grand Jury investigation into the.I murder of Barnet Baff , who was killed In the West Washington Market on Nov. 24 , led yesterday afternoon to the indlotment of Joseph Cohen and his brother Jacob , both of whom had worked in the market for many years . The Cohens were indicted for assault on A. T. Pearson last September and not fur the murder of Baff , but Acting District Attorney Delehanty told Judge Malone in the Court of General Sessions that their indictment had been " found necessary " in the course of the Baff investigation . At his request the Judge fixed the bail of each of the prisoners at $25,000 , so that their presence might be assured if they were needed in the Haft case . The brothers were locked up in the Tombs . In the opinion of tile District Attorney 's office , the assault on Pearson Lad the same inspiration and motive as the murder of Baff , and was similar to the murder in every way except that Mr. ' Pearson was not killed . The brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moore , who was arrested on Wednesday as the actual assailant of Mr. Pearson , had turned State 's evidenc , .. and said that the twos Cohens had hired him to attack Mr. Pearson . Moore was the principal wit- , ness before the Grand Jury yesterday . Moore and fh:e others were locked up last night as material witnesses in the Baff case . One of the five who was confined in the House of Detention was Harry Cohen , known as " Kid Griffo , " a brother of the two men under indictment . He is a Poultry Inspector in the market . It was rumored that he , as well as Moore , had turned State 's evidence , but this was denied by his lawyer , Alfred J. Gilchrist , of Neu , Gilchrist &; Spedick. 25 Court Street , Brooklyn . Secrecy Sought by Police . One of the other material witnesses held was Benjamin Lewis of 224 Throop Avenue , Williamsburg . He is a chicken handler in the Washington Market and , according to the police , was released from Sing Sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was said , of Abe Lewis , a notorious gangster . Every effort was made by the police and District Attorney 's office to keep secret the fact of his apprehension . , ' The three other material witnesses behind the bars were among those taken into custody on Wednesday night and early Thursday morning . They were David Rubin Kloiny , known as " Klondike " and " Little Dave " ; Isidore Switzsky , known as " Big Izzy , " and Moses Rosenstein , known as " Chicken Moe . " Klodny and Switzsky were arrested as suspected persons , and Rosenstein was arrested and charged with passing a forged check on a Coney Island shop-keeper . He was arraigned on this charge in the Coney Island Court yesterday and discharged when the complainant against him failed to appear . but he was retaken into custody immediately as a material witness In the Haft case and returned to Manhattan . The day 's quick succession of developments was planned on Thursday night in conference by Police Commissioner Woods , Guy H. Scull , his ' secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Assistant District Attorneys Murphy and Deuel . This conference was held in Police Headquarters and lasted until late at night . At 15 o'clock in the morning the police rounded up the three Cohen brothers and Lewis . Moore. , Rosenstein , Switzsky- , and Klodny already were In custody , and it was said that the information that made the arrest of the others pos1 sible came from one or more of them . Detectives Hagen and Golden found Harry Cohen at his home at 1,258 Thirty-eighth Street , Brooklyn , and Detectives L'Heureux , Birmingham , Noonan , and Peeples took Joseph and Jacob Cohen from their home at 105 Penn Street , Brooklyn . Detectives Behan , Reis , Brown , and Hemendinger found Lewis in his home at 225 Throop Avenue , Williamsburg . Moore Under Examination . None of these four men was taken to any police station or Headquarters and " booked , " but all were kept under cover throughout the day . The rumor that they had been taken into custody spread until it gained general acceptance , but no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , who were not technically prisoners until after the Grand Jury adjourned late in the afternoon . Moore was with Inspector Faurot and Mr. Delehanty a good part of yesterday morning and early in the afternoon , and , it was thought , gave them his full story . It seemed that little progress was being made with him when the Grand Jury was dismissed until Monday shortly after luncheon time and no indictments had been found . Mr. Delehanty , however , finished his last conference with Moore early in the afternoon , and at once asked Judge Malone to recall the Grand Jurors . He did so , and the jury reassembled in the Criminal Court Building at 4 o'clock . Mr. Pearson , the poultryman who was the complainant in the assault case , was one of the first witnesses , and Moore followed him . Six other witnesses whose names were not given out were called . and at 5:20 the Grand Jury handed up the indictments of the two Cohen brothers . Bench warrants were issued , and within five minutes the prisoners were arraigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lewis had been taken secretly to the Criminal Court Building to be held pending the action of the Grand Jury . Joseph Cohen said he wished to engage counsel before pleading to the indictment , and Judge Malone granted an adjournment until Monday morning . Mr. Delehanty then addressed the court . Although these men are charged with assault in the first degree , " he said " the indictments , against them were found necessary in the course of the investigation of the murder of Barnet Baff by the December Grand Jury . It is of the highest importance to the State that these men be held in such bail as will insure their presence at any time they may be wanted while this investigation is going on , and I , therefore , ask you to fix bail for each of them in the sum of $23,000 . " Bail Fixed at 825,000 . " I recognize the importance of the investigation . " Judge Malone replied , " and think the crime that provoked it is of sufficient magnitude to justify the bail you ask . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prisoners . " The brothers were asked whether they had anything to say and both nodded negatives . Senator Gilchrist admitted he expected to be retained by them as counsel . He said he had known the three Cohen brothers for many years and had represented Harry Cohen when he was arrested about two weeks ago on an old assault charge and subsequently dismissed . A friend of the Cohens , who had been unable to find them while the police had them hidden away , had urged him to take a hand in the case , he explained . Senator Gilchrist said he was sure neither Joseph nor Jacob Cohen could be connected criminally with the Miff murder . I have not gone into the case thoroughly . " he said . " but I have known the Cohen boys , and am more or less familiar with conditions in the West Washington Market out of which the murder of Baff grew . Since this murder none ' of the Cohen brothers has made any attempt to hide or get away , but on the contrary they have gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that the police have had them under surveillance , but this was useless , for they had nothing to fear and had no intention of fleeing . I do n't th nk they had any connection with either the assault on Pearson or the murder of Baff . " Regarding Harry Cohen , who has retained me as his counsel , I intend to take action tomorrow . I will have him released on a writ of habeas corpus , fur he is being held in the House of Detention illegally . No charge has been made against him and he has not been arraigned before any one . By tomorrow morning he will have been in custody twenty-four hours without arraignment . end this is positively against the law Resides getting him out of jail I do n't know what I shall do , but , if he desires it , I may bring a suit for heavy damages on the grounds that he has been denrived of his liberty ' ? Mr. Gilchrist was told of the report that Harry Cohen had given valuable information to the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remain in custody , but the lawyer refused to accept this as the truth . He said that , as far as he knew , Harry Cohen had given no information and the police were not justified in holding him without arraignment . Harry Cohen had told him that he knew nothing about the killing of Baff or the assaulting of Pearson . No One appeared who intended to seek the release of James Moore , and it was said at the District Attorney 's office that he decidedly did not want his immediate ? elertee , it being inferred that he was not ? anxious to be turned unguarded on the streets . ' Where he was ronfined Mr. Delehanty would not tell . He said the six witnesses were being kept apart so that all possibility of their getting together and " framing - a common story might be avoided . Grand Jury Programme . Moore will go before the Grand Jury again on Monday and complete his story . Others of the six will be called after tarp and then witnesses not in custody will be heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Mr. Delehanty . " We have now material that will keep the Grand Jury busy all day Monday , and perhaps all of the two days following . Also , our material is being supplemented half hourly , so that there is plenty of work ahead of us . Subpoenas have been issued for from forty to fifty witnesses , and Washington Market will be searched with a fine-toothed comb . for evidence bearing on the murder of Baff . " ? Mr. Delehanty admitted he felt " more cheerful . " about the . Baff case than at any time previous .. He would fnake. no predictions or boasts , but it was evident from his manner that he expected the . complete solution of the murder mystery . It was reported last night that the new development in the Bait murder started in the Coroner 's Court on Tuesday afternoon , when Michael J. Aseltta , a saloon keeper , of 327 West Forty-first Street , who was held for the Grand Jury by Coroner Feinberg for the killing of , a negro " Kid " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go lighter with him if he told who committed the Baff murder . Coroner Feinberg called Assistant District Attorney Deuel , Detective Flood of the District Attorney 's oftice , and the prisoner to the bench . ? Aseltta was told , without any promise , that any assistance he gave in the Baff case would be explained to the Judge before whom he would be arraigned for the lulling of Jones He then told according to Coroner Feinberg , the first names of two men , and said ' he did not know their last names , but that both were chicken handlers well known at - the market by the names he gave . Taken to Prosecutor'e Office . Aseltta. was taken to the District Attorney 's office and questioned . Coroner Feinberg said he did not know what details were learned from Aseltta there . The activities of the Cohen brothers in the West Washington Market and their connections with both chicken handlers and retail buyers have made them subject to pol.ce surveillance ever since Baff was murdered . Joseph Cohen , the eldest of the three , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market years ago as a boss truckman and made a good living renting horses to . the poultrymen . His first quarrel . with Barnet Baff occurred when Baff , after several of his horses had been poisoned , discontinued the use of horses and substituted automobiles . He thus set an example that , if followed , would depr.ve Cohen of his living , and , according to report , Cohen became bitter against Baff as a result . But Cohen extenued his business until , at present , he is called a contractor , for he not only supplies trucks , but is practically the boss of the laborers who handle the incoming poultry in the Hoboken freight yards and unload it in the market . He has contracted to supply labor in the market and has been known to be able to Control a large number of men . Harry Cohen , the second brother , was a poultry Inspector in the employ of the New York Live Poultry Dealers ' Protective Association , . an . organization of retail buyers who were bitter business enemies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to inspect each crate of poultry received in the market to see whether sand had been led to any of them to increase their weight . For this inspection Cohen charged the receivers of the poultry , Bale Pearson . and others , a crate , and bad blood arose between him and the two men named when they balked at paying this fee , calling it " blackmail ' and " graft " for Cohen 's benefit . Jake . the youngest . of the brothers , worked , when employed . as a poultry handler in the Hoboken freight yards . He was known in the market as the representative of his ' brothers on many occasions and is said to have kept them in touch with conditions and sentiments amour the men with whom he worked . Two Not Called to TeatifY ? Because of his influence and his ability to give employment to many , Joseph Cohen bad many prot ? g ? s , and among them was " Big Izzy " Switzsky . Switzsky was sentenced to Sing Sing some years ago for the assault for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he applied for parole recently Joseph Cohen appeared as his sponsor . He promised the parole Board to give " Big Izzy " permanent employment and . as far as possible . keep - him out of trouble . He did give Switzsky employment as a ' chicken . puller . Although- Switzsky and - Klodny were held as " material witnesses " as- far as could be learned , they were not interrogated as witnesses . They have not been taken before the Grand Jury , and it was said in the District Attorney 's ! office that perhaps they would not be taken before that body . A report spread that the District Attorney did not want them to gain immunity by testifying . . " Chicken Moe " Rosenstein waited for the Grand Jury to act ip.the Coney Island Police Court , a free man , but held in the court by notice to appear when called or forfeit , $1,500 bail . He we , s arrested an Wednesday night on a warrant charging him with passing a forged check , and on Thursday night he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bedford Avenue Brooklyn . The Magistrate released ' him ' in $1,500 bail , pending . examination in the Coney ' Island Court - yesterday , and he went to his home , watched closely by Detectives Flynn and Finn . - When court opened at Coney Island Rosenstein was on hand , but his case was not called .. Every other case on the docket was disposed of , and still Rosenstein sat in the courtroom . Magistrate Steers retired to his chambers and still Rosenstein waited , for court had not been adjourned , and the defendant was told that be certainle would be called before the adjourn- I ment . He did not know that the machinery was working in Manhattan and that the police were not quite ready to arrest him as a material witness . Finally , at 5 o'clock , Rosenstein was Called to the bar . Answering the charge of forgery , he said that he had received the check in question from another man and had simply asked the Coney Island shopkeeper to cash it . When he found that it was no good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $20 she had given him , , he actually had given her $11.50 . Before Magistrate Steers gave his decision he asked the man what he knew of the Baff murder , and Rosenstein denied any knowledge of the crime . He said he had known Baff very well and liked him . " Haft used to call me ' Sonny , ' " he said , " and I used to call him ' Dad . ' I was awful . sorry when I heard he - was killed . " The Magistrate discharged Rosenstein. and immediately Detectives Flynn and Finn took him in custody as a material witness in the Baff case . Mr. Delehanty would not give out the names of any of the witnesses who had been subpoenaed to testify before the Grand ' Jury on Monday , but it was learned that Harry Baff , son and business partner of the slain man , will be among them .
