SCENE : The studio in Pendleton 's apartment . A large room , with sky-light in center wall , doors right and left , table set for breakfast ; a vase with red flowers decorates the table . Center back stage , in front of sky-light , modeling stand upon which is placed a rough statuette , covered by cloth . To one side of this is a large screen . The furnishings are many hued , the cushions a flare of color , and the pictures fantastically futuristic . At Rise : Mrs. Abbey , a benevolent looking , middle-aged woman , in neat clothes and apron , is arranging some dishes on the table . Margaret , a very modern young woman , is exercising vigorously . She is decidedly good-looking . Her eyes are direct , her complexion fresh , and her movements free . Her brown hair is " bobbed , " and she wears a picturesque Grecian robe . MRS . ABBEY Breakfast is ready , ma'am . Margaret sits at table and helps herself . Exit Mrs. Abbey , left . MARGARET @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PENDLETON from without . I 'll be there in a moment . Margaret glances through paper ; Pendleton enters , door right . He is tall and thin , and of aesthetic appearance . His long blond hair is brushed loosely over his forehead and he is dressed in a holitrope-colored dressing gown . He lights a cigarette. p. 3 MARGARET I thought you were going to stop smoking before breakfast . PENDLETON My dear , I ca n't possibly stand the taste of tooth paste in my mouth all day . Pendleton sits at table . Enters Mrs. Abbey with tray . Pendleton helps himself , then drops his knife and fork with a clang . Mrs. Abbey and Margaret are startled . MRS . ABBEY Anything the matter , sir ? PENDLETON Dear , dear ! My breakfast is quite spoiled again . MRS . ABBEY concerned . Spoiled , sir ? PENDLETON pointing to red flowers on breakfast table . Look at those flowers , Mrs. Abbey . Not only are they quite out of harmony with the color scheme in this room , but they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horror of red . MRS . ABBEY But you like them that color sometimes , sir . What am I to do when you 're so temperamental about ' em . MARGARET Temperamental . I should say bad-tempered . MRS . ABBEY soothingly . Oh no , ma'am . It is n't bad temper . I understand Mr. Pendleton . It 's just another bad night he 's had , that 's what it is. p. 4 PENDLETON sarcastically polite . Mrs. Abbey , you appear to have an intimate knowledge of how I pass the nights . It 's becoming quite embarrassing . MRS . ABBEY You must n't mind an old woman like me , sir . The sound of a piano hopelessly out of tune , in the apartment upstairs , is heard , the player banging out Mendelssohn 's Wedding March with unusual insistence . PENDLETON There ! That confounded piano again ! MARGARET And they always play the Wedding March . There must be an old maid living there . MRS . ABBEY They 're doing that for a reason . MARGARET What reason ? MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks if she keeps on a-playing of the Wedding March , p'raps it 'll give you an ' Mr. Pendleton the idea of getting married . She do n't believe in couples livin ' to-gether , like you an ' Mr. Pendleton . MARGARET No ? MRS . ABBEY And I just said you an ' Mr. Pendleton had been living together so long , it was my opinion you might just as well be married an ' done with it . MARGARET angrily . Your opinion is quite uncalled for , Mrs. Abbey . p. 5 PENDLETON Why should n't Mrs. Abbey give us her opinion ? It may be valuable . Look at her experiences in matrimony . MRS . ABBEY In matrimony , and out of it , too . MARGARET sitting . But Mrs. Abbey has no right to discuss our affairs with other people 's maids . MRS . ABBEY I 'll be glad to quit if I do n't suit the mistress . MARGARET angrily . There ! Mistress again ! How often have I asked you not to refer to me as the mistress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'd better see if there 's any mail , Mrs. Abbey , and take those flowers away with you . MRS . ABBEY Very well , sir . Exit Mrs. Abbey door center . MARGARET What an old-fashioned point of view Mrs. Abbey has . Pendleton takes up paper and commences to read . MARGARET Pommy , why do you stoop so ? PENDLETON Am I stooping ? MARGARET I 'm tired of telling you . You ought to take more exercise . Pendleton continues to read. p. 6 MARGARET One reason why the Greeks were the greatest of artists was because they cultivated the body as carefully as the mind . PENDLETON Oh ! Hang the Greeks ! Enter Mrs. Abbey right , with letters . MRS . ABBEY There are your letters , sir . Coldly . And these are yours , ma'am . Exit Mrs. Abbey left . MARGARET who has opened her letters meanwhile . How delightful ! Tom Del Valli has asked us to a party at his studio next Friday . PENDLETON opening his letters . Both of us ? MARGARET giving him letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PENDLETON Both of us ? MARGARET picking up another letter . Yes , and here 's one form Bobby Watson for Sunday . PENDLETON Both of us ? MARGARET Yes . PENDLETON Really , Margaret , this is becoming exasperating . Holds up letters . Here are four more , I suppose for both of us . People keep on inviting us out together time after time as though we were the most conventional married couple on God 's earth . p. 7 MARGARET Do you object to going out with me ? PENDLETON doubtfully . No , it is n't that . But we 're having too much of a good thing . And I 've come to the conclusion that it 's your fault . MARGARET indignantly . Oh ! it 's my fault ? Of course you 'd blame me . Why ? PENDLETON Because you have such an absurd habit of boasting to people of your devotion for me , when we 're out . MARGARET You surely do n't expect me to quarrel with you in public ? PENDLETON It is n't necessary to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're utterly , almost stupidly in love with one another , what can you expect ? MARGARET You said once you never wanted me to suppress anything . PENDLETON That was before we began to live together . MARGARET What could I have done ? PENDLETON up right . Anything just so we could have a little more freedom instead of being tied to one another the way we are . Never a moment when we 're not together , never a day when I 'm not interviewed by special article writers from almost every paper and magazine in the country , as the only successful exponent of the theory that love can be so perfect that the marriage contract degrades it . I put it to you , Margaret , if this is a free union it is simply intolerable ! p. 8 MARGARET But are n't we living together so as to have more freedom ? Think of what it might be if we were married . Did n't you once write that " When marriage comes in at the door , freedom flies out at the window " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treating us as though we were living together to prove a principle ? MARGARET Well , are n't we incidently ? You said so yourself . We can be a beautiful example to other people , and show them how to lead the pure natural lives of the later Greeks ? PENDLETON Damn the later Greeks ! Why do you always throw those confounded later Greeks in my face ? We 've got to look at it from our standpoint . This situation must come to an end . MARGARET What can we do ? PENDLETON It rests with you . MARGARET With me ? PENDLETON You can compromise yourself with somebody publicly . That 'll put an end to everything . MARGARET How will that end it ? PENDLETON It 'll break down the morally sanctified atmosphere in which we 're living . Then perhaps , people will regard us as immoral and treat us like decent human beings again . p. 9 MARGARET But I do n't want to compromise myself . PENDLETON If you believe in your own ideas , you must . MARGARET But why should I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy for you . MARGARET Why ca n't we both be compromised ? That would be better still . PENDLETON I should find it a bore . You , unless my memory fails me , would enjoy it . MARGARET You need n't be cynical . Even if you do n't enjoy it , you can work it into a novel . PENDLETON It 's less exertion to imagine an affair of that sort , and the result would probably be more saleable . Besides I have no interest whatsoever in women , at least , in the women we know . MARGARET For that matter , I do n't know any eligible men . PENDLETON What about Bob Lockwood ? MARGARET But he 's your best friend ! PENDLETON Exactly  --  no man ever really trusts his best friend . He 'll probably compromise you without compunction . MARGARET I 'm afraid he 'd be too dangerous  --  he tells you all his secrets . Whom will you choose ? p. 10 PENDLETON It 's a matter of complete indifference to me . MARGARET I 've heard a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? PENDLETON firmly . Margaret , I do n't mind being party to a flirtation  --  but I draw the line at being the victim of a seduction . MARGARET Why not leave it to chance ? Let it be the next interesting woman you meet . PENDLETON That might be amusing . But there must be an age limit . And how about you ? MARGARET takes cloth off statuette and discloses figure of Apollo in rough modeling clay . Me ! Why not the new model who is coming to-day to pose for my Apollo ? PENDLETON Well , if he 's anything like that , you ought to be able to create a sensation . Then , perhaps , we shall have some real freedom . MARGARET Pommy , do you still love me as much as you did ? PENDLETON How you sentimentalize ! Do you think I 'd be willing to enter into a flirtation with a strange woman , if I did n't want to keep on living with you ? MARGARET And we wo n't have to break up our little home , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the home . Catches himself . My God ! If any of my readers should hear me say that ! To think that I , Pomeroy Pendleton , should be trying to save my own home . And yet , how characteristically paradoxical . MARGARET interrupting . You are going to philosophize ! Give me a kiss . She goes to him , sits on his lap , and places her arm on his shoulder ; he takes out cigarette , she lights it for him . PENDLETON brought back to reality . I have some work to do  --  I must go . MARGARET A kiss ! PENDLETON kisses her carelessly . There let me go . MARGARET I want a real kiss . PENDLETON Do n't be silly , dear , I ca n't play this morning . I 've simply got to finish my last chapter . A bell rings , Mrs. Abbey enters and goes to door . MRS . ABBEY There 's a lady to see Mr. Pendleton . MARGARET Tell her to come in ! PENDLETON But , Margaret ! MARGARET Remember ! Significantly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abbey enters with Baroness de Meauville . Exit Mrs. Abbey. p. 12 BARONESS speaking with a pronounced English accent . Good morning , Mr. Pendleton , I 'm the Baroness de Meauville ! PENDLETON recalling her name . Baroness de Meauville ? Ah , the costumiere ? BARONESS Not a costumiere , Mr. Pendleton , I am an artist , an artist in modern attire . A woman is to me what a canvas is to a painter . PENDLETON Excuse me for receiving you in my dressing gown . I was at work . BARONESS I like to see men in dressing gowns  --  yours is charming . PENDLETON flattered and pleased . Do you like it ? I designed it myself . BARONESS looking seductively into his eyes . How few really creative artists there are in America . PENDLETON modestly . You flatter me . BARONESS Not at all . You must know that I 'm a great admirer of yours , Mr. Pendleton . I 've read every one of your books . I feel I know you as an old friend . PENDLETON That 's very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes jeweled cigarette case from reticule and offers Pendleton a cigarette. p. 13 BARONESS Will you smoke ? PENDLETON Thanks . Pendleton lights her cigarette , then his own . He draws his chair up to the couch . An atmosphere of mutual interest is established . BARONESS Mr. Pendleton , I have a mission in life . It is to make the American woman the best dressed woman in the world . I came here to-day because I want you to help me . PENDLETON But I have no ambitions in that direction . BARONESS Why should you have ambitions ? Only the bourgeoisie have ambitions . We artists have inspirations . I want to breathe into you the spirit of my great undertaking . Already I have opened my place in the smartest part of the Avenue . Already I have drawn my assistants from all parts of the world . Nothing is lacking to complete my plans but you . PENDLETON Me ? Why me ? BARONESS endearingly . Are you not considered one of the foremost men of letters in America ? PENDLETON modestly . Did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you not the only writer who has successfully portrayed the emotional side of American life ? p. 14 PENDLETON decidedly . Yes . BARONESS Exactly . That is why I have chosen you to write my advertisements . PENDLETON aghast . But , Baroness ! BARONESS You 're not going to say that . It 's so ordinary . PENDLETON But , but , you want me to write advertisements ! BARONESS Please do n't disappoint me . PENDLETON Yes , I suppose that 's so . But one has a sense of pride . BARONESS Art comes before Pride . Consider my feelings , an aristocrat , coming here to America and engaging in commerce , and advertising , and other dreadful things , and all for the sake of Art ! PENDLETON But you make money out of it ! BARONESS Only incidentally . Just as you , in writing my advertisements , would make , say ten thousand or so , as a sort of accident . But do n't let us talk of money . It 's perfectly revolting , is n't it ? Art is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake . That 's why I 'm a success . PENDLETON Indeed ? How interesting . Please go on . BARONESS When a woman comes to me for a gown , I do n't measure body , why should I ? I measure her mind . I find her color harmony . In a moment I can tell whether she ought to wear scarlet , mauve , taupe , magenta , or any other color , so as to fall into her proper rhythm . Every one has a rhythm , you know . Pendleton sits on sofa . But I do n't have to explain all this to you , Mr. Pendleton . You understand it intuitively . This heliotrope you are wearing shows me at once that you are in rhythm . p. 15 PENDLETON thinks of Margaret . I 'm not so sure that I am . What you say interests me . May I ask you a question ? BARONESS Yes , but I may not answer it . PENDLETON Why do you wear heliotrope and the same shade as mine ? BARONESS with mock mystery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all curiosity . BARONESS Curiosity is dangerous . PENDLETON Supposing I try to find out ? BARONESS That may be even more dangerous . PENDLETON I 'm fond of that kind of danger . BARONESS Take care ! I 'm very fragile . PENDLETON Is n't heliotrope in rhythm with the faint reflection of passion ? BARONESS How brutal of you to have said it . PENDLETON coming closer to her . I , too , am in rhythm with heliotrope . BARONESS with joy . How glad I am . Thank God you 've no desire to kiss my lips . PENDLETON Only your finger-tips . They exchange kisses on fingertips. p. 16 PENDLETON Your fingers are like soft , pale , waxen tapers ! BARONESS Your kisses are the breathings that light them into quivering flame ! PENDLETON Exquisite  --  exquisite ! BARONESS withdrawing her hands.That was a moment ! PENDLETON We must have many such . BARONESS Many ? That 's too near too much . PENDLETON feverishly . We shall , dear lady . BARONESS How I adore your writings ! They have made me realize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man for one woman at a time . Let us have such a union , you and me . PENDLETON taken back . But I live in such a union already . BARONESS rising in amazement . And only a moment ago you kissed me ! PENDLETON Well  --  what of it ? BARONESS Do n't you see what we 've done ? You are living in one of those wonderful unions you describe in your books  --  and I 've let you kiss me . I 've committed a sacrilege . p. 17 PENDLETON You 're mistaken . It is n't a sacrilege . It 's an opportunity . BARONESS dramatically . How can you say that  --  you whose words have inspired my deepest intimacies . No , I must go . Makes for the door . I  --  must  --  go . PENDLETON You do n't understand . I exaggerated everything so in my confounded books . BARONESS Please ask her to forgive me . Please tell her I thought you were married , otherwise , never , never , would I have permitted you to kiss me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BARONESS One often believes what one hopes . PENDLETON You take it too seriously . Let me explain . BARONESS What is there to explain ? Our experience has been complete . Why spoil it by anti-climax ? PENDLETON Am I never to see you again ? BARONESS Who knows ? If your present union should end , and some day your soul needs  --  some one ? Exit door center , her manner full of promise . PENDLETON with feeling . Good-by  --  long , pale fingers . Enter Margaret , door right. p. 18 MARGARET Did you get a good start with the scandal ? PENDLETON Not exactly . I may as well admit it was a failure through no fault of mine , of course . And now , I simply must finish that last chapter . He exits . Margaret rings . Mrs. Abby enters . MARGARET You may clear , Mrs. Abbey . MRS . ABBEY Very well , ma'am . She attends to clearing the table . MARGARET Mrs. Abbey , have you worked for many people living together , like Mr. Pendleton and myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've worked in nearly every house on the south side of Washington Square . MARGARET Mr. Pendleton says I 'm as domestic as any wife could be . Were the others like me ? MRS . ABBEY Most of them , ma'am , but some was regular hussies ; not only a-livin ' with their fellers  --  but havin ' a good time , too . That 's what I call real immoral . Bell rings . Mrs. Abbey opens door center and passes out . Conversation with Fenton without is heard . Mrs. Abbey comes back . MRS . ABBEY A young man wants to see you , ma'am . p. 19 MARGARET That 's the new model . I 'll get my working apron . Exit Margaret , door right . Mrs. Abbey calls through door center . MRS . ABBEY You c'n come in . Enter door left , Charles P. K. Fenton , dictionary salesman . He is a strikingly handsome young man , offensively smartly dressed in a black and white check suit , gaudy tie , and white socks . His hair is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He carries a black bag . His manner is distinctly " male . " MRS . ABBEY points to screen . You can undress behind there . FENTON Undress ? Say , what 's this ? A Turkish bath ? MRS . ABBEY Did you expect to have a private room all to yourself ? FENTON looking around . What am I to undress for ? MRS . ABBEY The missus will be here in a minute . FENTON Good night ! I 'm goin ' . Makes for door . MRS . ABBEY What 's the matter ? Ai n't you the Missus ' new model ? FENTON A model ! Ha ! Ha ! You 've sure got the wrong number this time . I 'm in the dictionary line , ma'am . p. 20 MRS . ABBEY Well , of all the impudence ! You a book agent , and a-walkin ' in here . FENTON Well , you asked me in , did n't you ? Ca n't I see the missus , jest for a minute ? MRS . ABBEY good-naturedly . Very well . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove that Spearmint from your mouth , if you want to sell any dictionaries in this house . FENTON placing hand to mouth . Where shall I put it ? MRS . ABBEY You 'd better swallow it ! Fenton tries to do so , chokes , turns red , and places his hand to mouth . MARGARET to Fenton . I 'm so glad to see you . Fenton is most embarrassed . Mrs. Abbey , in surprise , attempts to explain situation . MRS . ABBEY But , ma'am  --  MARGARET You may go , Mrs. Abbey . MRS . ABBEY But , but , ma'am  --  MARGARET severely . You may go , Mrs. Abbey . Exit Mrs. Abbey in a huff . I 'm so glad they sent you up to see me . Wo n't you sit down ? Fenton finds it a difficult matter to handle the situation . He adopts his usual formula for an " opening , " but his speech is mechanical and without conviction . Margaret adds to the embarrassment by stepping around him and examining him with professional interest. p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sales Co. , the largest publishers of dictionaries in the world . MARGARET continuing to appraise him . Then you 're not the new model ? FENTON No , ma'am . MARGARET What a pity ! Never mind , go on . FENTON As I was saying , ma'am , I represent the Advertising Globe Publishing  --  I mean the Globe Publishing Sales Publishing Co. , the largest publishers of dictionaries in the world . For some time past we have felt there was a demand for a new Encyclopaedic Dictionary , madam , one that would not only fill up a good deal of space in the book-shelf , making an attractive addition to the home , but also containing the most complete collection of words in the English language . MARGARET who has taken a pencil and is measuring Fenton while he speaks ; Fenton 's discomfort is obvious . He attempts to rearrange his tie and coat , thinking she is examining him . Please go on talking , it 's so interesting . FENTON Statistics show that the Woman of Average Education in America , Madam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictionary , Madam , Produces book from bag. will give you command of over eight hundred and fifty thousand . p. 22 MARGARET archly . So you are a dealer in words  --  how perfectly romantic . FENTON warming . Most of these words , madam , are not used more than a dozen times a year . They are our Heritage from the Past . And all these words , to say nothing of the fact that the dictionary fills five inches in a book-shelf , making an attractive addition to the library , being handsomely bound in half-cloth  --  all these are yours , ma'am , for the price of one dollar . He places dictionary in her hand . She examines it . FENTON If you have a son , madam , the possession of this dictionary will give him an opportunity of acquiring that knowledge of our language which made Abraham Lincoln the Father of our Country . Madam , opportunity knocks at the door only once and This is your opportunity at one dollar . MARGARET meaningly . Yes , this is my opportunity ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me your name ? FENTON pocketing dollar . My name is Charles P. K. Fenton . MARGARET Mr. Fenton , would you mind doing me a favor ? p. 23 FENTON looking dubiously towards the screen . Why , I guess not , ma'am . MARGARET I want you to take off your coat . FENTON puzzled . You 're not trying to kid me , ma'am ? MARGARET I just want to see your development . Do you mind ? FENTON removes coat . Why , no , ma'am , if that 's all you want . MARGARET Now , bring your arm up , tighten the muscles . Fenton does as she bids ; Margaret thumps his arm approvingly . Splendid ! You must take lots of exercise , Mr. Fenton . FENTON Not me , ma'am . I never had no time for exercise ; I got that workin ' in a freight yard . MARGARET I suppose you think me rather peculiar , Mr. Fenton . FENTON You said it , Miss . MARGARET You see I 'm a sculptress . Points to statuette . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's great . Examines statuette . Just like them statues at the Metropolitan . MARGARET That figure is Apollo , Mr. Fenton . p. 24 FENTON Oh , Apollo . MARGARET I was to engage a professional model for it , but I could never hope to get a professional as fine a type as you . Will you pose for it ? FENTON aghast . Me ? That feller there without any clothes . Dubiously . Well , I do n't know . It 's kind of chilly here . MARGARET If I draped you , it would spoil some of your lines . Seeing his hesitation . But I will if you like . FENTON relieved . Ah , now you 're talking . MARGARET So , you 'll really come ? FENTON How about this evening ? MARGARET Splendid ! Sit down . Fenton does so . Mr. Fenton , you 've quite aroused my curiosity . I know so few business men . Is your work interesting ? FENTON Well , I ca n't say it was , until I started selling around this neighborhood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got personality , Miss . That 's the thing , personality . If a feller has n't got personality , he ca n't sell goods , that 's sure . p. 25 MARGARET Well , it 's what sells the goods . I do n't know how else to explain it exactly . I 'll look it up in the dictionary . Takes dictionary and turns pages . Here it is , ma'am . Per  --  per  --  why , it is n't in here . I guess they do n't put in words that everybody knows . We all know what personality means . It 's what sells the goods . MARGARET I adore a strong , virile , masculine personality . FENTON I do n't quite get you , madam . MARGARET The men I know have so much of the feminine in them . FENTON Oh , " Cissies " ! MARGARET flirtingly . They lack the magnetic forcefulness which I like so much in you . FENTON I believe you are kidding me . Does that mean you like me ? MARGARET That 's rather an embarrassing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me speak to you this way . MARGARET archly . Never mind whether I like you . Tell me whether you like me ? FENTON feeling more at home . Gee ! I did n't get on to you at first . Sure I like you . p. 26 MARGARET Then we 're going to be good friends . FENTON You just bet me are . Say , got a date for to-morrow evening ? MARGARET No . FENTON How about the movies ? There 's a fine feature film at the Strand . Theda Bara in " The Lonesome Vampire , " five reels . They say it 's got " Gloria 's Romance " beat a mile . MARGARET I do n't know that I 'd care to go there . FENTON How about a run down to Coney ? MARGARET Coney ! I 've always wanted to do wild Pagan things . FENTON Say , you 'll tell me your name , wo n't you ? MARGARET Margaret Marshall . FENTON Do you mind if I call you Margie ? MARGARET If you do , I must call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of Margie . Some class to that . MARGARET I 'm glad you like it . FENTON moving nearer . And some class to you ! MARGARET coyly . So you really like me ? p. 27 FENTON You bet . Say , before I go , you 've got to give me a kiss , Margie . MARGARET Well , I do n't know . Are n't you rather " rushing " me ? FENTON Say , you are a kidder . He draws her up from her chair , and kisses her warmly on the lips . MARGARET ecstastically . You have the true Greek spirit ! They kiss again . If only Pommy would kiss me that way ! FENTON Pommy ? Who 's Pommy ? MARGARET Pommy is the man I live with . FENTON Your husband ! MARGARET No , we just live together . You see , we do n't believe in marriage . FENTON pushing her away in horror . I thought there was something queer about all this . Does he live here ? MARGARET Yes . Points to door . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I 'm goin ' . Looks for hat . MARGARET speaking with real anguish . You 're surely not going just on that account . p. 28 FENTON taking hat and bag . Is n't that enough ? MARGARET emotionally . Please do n't go . Listen , I ca n't suppress my feeling for you ; I never do with anybody . I liked you the moment I saw you , I want you , as a friend , a good friend . You ca n't go now , just when everything 's about to begin . FENTON severely . Fair 's fair , Miss . If he 's keeping you , you ca n't be taking up with me at the same time . That puts the finish on it . MARGARET But he does n't keep me . I keep myself . FENTON Wait a minute . You support yourself , and live with him of your own free will . Then you 've got no excuse for being immoral ; ' tis n't like you had to make your living at it . At door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's no use , Miss . Even though I am a salesman , I 've got a sense of honor . I sized you up as a married woman when I came in just now , or I never would have made love to you at all . MARGARET Oh  --  wait ! Supposing I should want to buy some more dictionaries . FENTON returning . Your 've got my card , Miss . The ' phone number is on it . Bryant 4253 . Sees Margaret hang her head . Do n't feel hurt , Miss . You 'll get over these queer ideas some day , and when you do , well , you 've got my number . So long , kid . Exit Fenton , door , center. p. 29 MARGARET taking his card from table and placing it to her lips soulfully . My Apollo , Bryant 4253 ! PENDLETON Did you get a good start with your scandal . Margaret hangs her head . It 's no use ; I 'm convinced we 're in a hopeless muddle . MARGARET I heartily agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MARGARET I have my reasons . PENDLETON The fact is , Margaret , that so long as we live together we 're public figures , with everybody else as our jury . MARGARET But lots of people read your books and respect us . PENDLETON The people that respect us are worse than the people that do n't . MARGARET If they would n't always be bothering about our morals ! PENDLETON If we continue living together , we shall simply be giving up our freedom to prove we are free . MARGARET faltering . I suppose we ought to separate . PENDLETON I believe we should . MARGARET We 'll have to give up the studio . p. 30 PENDLETON regretfully . Yes . MARGARET It 's taken a long time to make the place homelike . PENDLETON We 've been very comfortable here . MARGARET I shall miss you at meals . PENDLETON I shall have to start eating at clubs and restaurants again , no more good home cooking . MARGARET We 're kind of used to one another , are n't we ? PENDLETON It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MARGARET And there are mighty few studios with as good a light as this ; I do n't want to separate if you do n't . PENDLETON But , Margaret .

PENDLETON Yes , marry , and do it at once . That 'll end everything . MARGARET Let 's do it right away and get it over with ; I simply must finish my Apollo . p. 31 PENDLETON I 'm going to buy you a new gown to get married in , a wedding present from Baroness de Meauville 's . MARGARET I do n't know that I want a De Meauville gown . PENDLETON Please let me . I want to give you something to symbolize our new life together . MARGARET Very well .

You can take it from me , ma'am , you 'll find that respectability pays . MARGARET at ' phone . Bryant 4253 ? Sweetly . Is that Mr. Fenton ? Pause.
