txt The eight million people that still hold the center of the stage in war , peace , finance and problems of civilization and are counted as London , divide into many cities and in a sense every part is a foreign part . Thousands daily work " in the City " or financial district and know nothing of the West End or Westminster . But in the halls of Westminster , the representative of " the City " has been there for a generation and what is going on in Parliamentary circles , at the Treasury , and before the Cabinet , is closely followed by the leaders in finance . Although England recognizes the rising power of the Labor Party , the foundations of the Empire in finance and in trade are nowhere attacked as in the United States . The Englishman is for law and order every time , although he will patiently listen to all sorts of proposals to improve the conditions of labor and join in demands for better housing conditions and better industrial conditions . PROTECTING ' MEN AND M oxr.v Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England today for improved conditions of labor than one hundred years ago when Robert Owen stood before Parliament and demanded reforms for the poor and the down-trodden in England 's industrial system , when babes went from the workhouse to labor in practical servitude at five years of age and the English agricultural laborer was little better than a serf . Everybody now sees more clearly that a nation exist ; in its people and not in its wealth , and there is a better understanding of the American protective system which has raised the wages of labor and protected " the home market " in which labor spends its higher wages , and effects a broad general prosperity to the despair of the theoretical free trader . The protection that the United States formerly threw around labor , the British Government is today throwing . ' round finance and the protection of her " City " interests . It is to protect finance , the value of the pound sterling , the gold basis of England , and maintain her international discount market that England 's decrees go forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the goods at low prices . It is not that England would protect : ter home market . It is that England must protect her financial base . IN THE CITY OF LONDON England is not attempting to protect the labor of the ' hundreds of bill brokers who still wear their top hats in the " City " Summer and Winter and eat their noon luncheon on the same spot and at the same minute as for twenty years past . England is endeavoring to protect that trade which is the bulwark of the island and whose shipways between foreign ports and English warehouses are greased from the English discount market . The simplicity of the machinery here is heiroglyphic to the outside world . The strongest endorsement is " eminently respectable . " The strongest condemnation is " look sharp . " Every man selects his bills for the investment of surplus funds and is never asked why he buys a certain line and always rejects a certain other line . Whenever there is a dereliction in the city , a piece of sharp practice , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune may rise , where lack of integrity has been shown , the action will arise twenty or forty years afterward as a bar to association . SD IN DUES There is one thing that makes the " City " men warm under the collar at the present time and that is the quotation at about 82 of the 30 . Exchequer bonds due in 1930 . They quote them in the " City " by the name of " Swindles . " England has stood behind English exchanges and war credits . When the Russian treasury bills , nine millioa pounds sterling . became due a year ago . the British Goverrment , which had asked the " City " folks originally to grant this credit , concluded it could not allow a default , but that it could propose a compromise . It gave the holders the 3% Exchtquer bonds . Altogether there was fifteen million pounds sterling in the transaction and the " City " men exclaimed : " The Government could give five hundred million sterling for munitions , but to have three million , it spoiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is offered to us now are just swindles . " And " Swindles " they became in the parlance of the " City . " BRITISH SUBJECTS One realizes the unity and power of Great Britain when in distant quaiters he hears the command : " British subjects pass this w* " and it is obeyed quietly and withcut question . The Englishman is proud of the words " British " and " subjects . " The man from America may proclaim himself a citizen , but will deny that he is a subject to anything under Heaven . Yet there can be no nation and no citizenship unless all citizens are subjects under the law . Orders are still given and executed in England with a quietness that is still astonishing . An American friend of mine noticed in the elevators connecting with the Underground Railways the " No Smoking " sign ; penalty 40 shillings . He was astonished to see pipes , cigars and cigarettes in the mouths of the people in the elevators , and pointed out the situation to his English friend as an evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law and order . His friend responded : " Look again , and tell me who is smoking . " And my American friend Nt as astonished to find that there was never a smoke in the elevator . Everybody held his pipe quietly in his mouth . Every man effectively obeyed the law in the quietest possible - nannei , kept his pipe in hi= month , but emitted no smoke in the elevator ; and the same was true at the Underground station where people pass from train to stairway or elevator . The law was obeyed in the spirit in good faith . marrisw FOB LI I. ? . On both sides of the ocean , and among all the Allies , it should be well understood that England in fighting : 4 tremendous battle , not only for English civilization , but for the maintenance of her Empire . and she must not permit disintegrating forces in her trade and credit rela ? Lions , so far as she con protect them . And we Yankees should remember that any assaults at the present time open the trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in bad form . " We are building ships to help the world and to bring clown freight rates that are tenfold too high and not to incept , or interrupt , the trade lines of our Allies . We must give our European friends full time to get the millions that tbey have put into the battle for freedom back to the home base . By the same rule under which tie should not allow Germany with stolen machinery to jump into a trade contest with Belgium and northern France , we should not we the strong financial position which the United State. ; hac attained in the war as a leverage against the trade of our Allies . GOLD CURRENCY I asked an English banker and expert in exchange what i might expect if I appeared at the Bank of England with sonic five-pound notes and asked for gold . He replied : " You would probably get the gold , for the Bank has not yet refused it . But your name and address would be taken and it would be perfectly proper to inquire the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ' record and your action would be inquired into to determine if you were really a friendly ally . And you might have less trouble than most people are having in England to get passage out of the country . Probably no attention would he paid to a few freak gold pieces , such as those with which you surprised , on your trip last year , the children here who were not old enough to remember the time when gold was current coin , and paper one-pound notes and paper ten shilling pieces had not been invented .
