txt Boston News Bureau says : We understand another eleventh hour hitch has occurred between preferred and common stockholders ' committees of the International Mercantile Marine . The preferred committee takes position that in their reorganization proposals they have conceded very much more than they were called upon to do in their anxiety to arrive at a readjustment to all security interests . They will go no further . Common stockholders are still dissatisfied , notwithstanding it was agreed to waive their assessment , and preferred stockholders are now de%rmined to fight it out to a finish and preserve their full legal rights . Foreclosure of bonds will be immediately sought and common stockholders will undoubtedly seek to prevent such foreclosure . Those who have been following affairs of company bare wondered at generosity of preferred stockholders ' committee in agreeing to accept in reorganization but 50% of their accrued dividends , agreeing to take new common stock for their claims and on top of it all to wait five years for a final settlement . Whatever now transpires would seem to be in direction of securing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and earnings of the new company .
