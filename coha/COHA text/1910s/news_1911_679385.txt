Souder said , Mr. Arnold and Mr. Keith told him they had received information that an automobile with a girl that may have been Miss Dorothy had arrived here about that time . This and other information received , they told the local chief of detectives , convinced them that a search of this city for the missing girl would be a wise move . Capt . Souder met Messrs .

He says there was every evidence that the trip was prearranged . Beyond the above statements Capt . Souder was not willing to be quoted . He did say , however , that lie was afraid that Mr. Arnold was taking the Phila. clelphia story too seriously . I do n't think that you fellows need worry about Miss Arnold being found to-1 night . anyway . " said Capt . Souder. - for I am certain she will not be found tonight , at least in Philadelphia .

" When they left Capt . Souder 's office , which is on the fifth floor of Police Head- ' quarters , Messrs . Arnold and Keith and the detectives did so by a side door , and ran as fast as they could to the private elevator , which was waiting for them . Two minutes later they were speeding away in their automobile . The locality where a girl resembling Miss Arnold was seen was North Eighteenth and Mount Vernon Streets . Capt . Souder remained in his office until 11 o'clock , and said when he left that he would not be back to=night ' unless something happened .
