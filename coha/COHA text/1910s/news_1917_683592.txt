The correspondent can recall no previous time when army . engineers have undergone such varied and thrilling experiences as yesterday . The latest reports say that several Americans why were actually captured by the Germans escaped after a few hours and made their way back to the British line . How many of them spent agonizing hours lying in shell holes . with the enemy all about it is impossible to state , but there were a large number .

But even in the stress of this moment the British officers sized up the situation , and , before starting to shoot , signaled to their allies to lie flat on the ground : The engineers dropped where they stood , and in another instant a steady stream of rifle and machine gun bullets was whining over them . The British pushed forward far enough to enable the engineers to join their ranks , and thus saved them . But these engineers and others repaid the score , for they touit their . place ' in the fighting line and battled like tigers .

The engineers themselves have had little to say about the affair . For the Most part they merely smiled and admitted that they had been in an engagement and then changed the conversation .

" All Practical Railroad lien . Special to The Now York Times . WASHINGTON , Dec. ** American engineers who acted so gallantly near Gouzeaucourt were doubtless members of the regiments organized in this country early in the war and . sent to France 1.0 assist in constructing railroads leading to the front . These regiments are composed almost entirely of practical railway men . Each is commanded t.y an officer of the Engineer Corps of the United States Army , but most of the subordinate . officers were employes of railroad companies or practicing the profession of civil engineering up to the time they were commissioned . Several brigades of railroad regiments were organized , . and their work in France was so valuable that the War Department is now organizing an even larger force . The work of organization was and is being conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Western Railroad Company , who established headquarters in Washington and has ' given up his time to the exclusion of his regular professional duties to carry on the work . The first brigades were organized with , remarkable quickness . Some of the regiments or parts of them were formed in New York , Pittsburgh , Chicago , St. Louis , and Atlanta . Practical railroad men , from operating officers and civil engineers down to track workmen , were incited to join , the entire membership being composed of volunteers . Practical shop workmen were commissioned and placed in charge of repair shops behind the lines with skilled mechanics under them , all in khaki with the double cantle of the Engineer Corps on their collars . The enlisted men of the field forces were largely track workmen .

Dec. ** Barclay Parsons of New York , one of the three men who formulated the $250,000 fraction and subway report for Chicago last Spring- , was probably one of the American engineers caught in the German turning movement . Some weeks back Lieut . Col. Parsons wrote a Chicago friend that he and others were working within a mile and a half of the German line and in front of the British guns .
