txt United Alloy Steel Corporation has no war orders on its books and it is not in the market for any . The remarkable growth of this company since its organization in 1904 to a capacity of 780,000 tons as of January 1 next has been made entirely on domestic business and has been due principally to the phenomenal development in the automobile industry with its large demand for alloy steel .
