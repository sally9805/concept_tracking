The Brain of the Army HE is President of the Panama Railroad , responsible head of the Bureau of Railroad , Affairs , of the Philippine Commission , and of the government of Porto Rico . He ts Chairman of the Council of National De- iefnse ? But let us think of him only as Secretary nt War . Is there any other executive in the World who at this moment is in immediate charge ? 7 , so many important undertakings ? President 1 , , " iilsoo lays out the route of the car and makes t hellihig comments on the landscape . Mr. Baker The French the wheel and directs the mechanician. he French and British Ministers of War are ' 111w roaring along the course in finely adjusted : acers , 1918 model . They are just keeping pace with Hindenburg . Mr. Baker started in , 11 antique runabout , and as he travels he has to tinker it , part by part , into something which can g ? fast and far . He can not stop by the roadside the rebuild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will depend largely on him . His friends understand " aderstand that he can not remodel everything at bnee , but they know how pressing is the necessity ntil for thoroughness and for speed . They know That six months from now , if anything important goes Wrong , his enemies will blame him for it . And I1 of that , everything important must go right tthe Last week Mr. Hard showed that Mr. Baker hq made a good beginning by putting the brain of the army , the General Staff , where it belongs , at the head of the army . But he also showed that Somehow or other the Staff has not made close bnnection with the nervous system . It seems to 5 ? remote that hands and feet often jerk along e " ePe dependently . Is there anything else the matter , the that the War College is three miles " down river " ? No one can know much about such a q uestion without L on out having access to all the informa-on and experience tumbling in on Mr. Baker , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to com4.e the American organization with those of our w hich certain of the features information about ? 1 is accessible in published reports . The first duty of the American Chief of Staff time tar ' the law is to be military adviser to the Secre- itj , ? f War . He can and does advise on large tw'ers , but he is a busy man , he must often be e.4437 from his office , and , like most executives , he hislinot be cognizant of all details without consulting A , . subordinates . Only a few of these are in the nveear bepartment building . Yet Secretary Baker 's d for detailed military information is constant and pressing . Many who consult him must have prompt and accurate decisions . Mr. Baker 's own time would be saved if there were trustworthy and informed military advisers at his elbow . Suppose the American Secretary of War , like most of the European War Ministers , had a personal military staff , composed of trained officers who had access to every paper and every man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , they might even at times catch the General Staff in a delay or a mistake . They could help him as no officer could who has other duties besides that of gathering information for the Secretary 's personal use . The main duty of our General Staff is to plan and to coordinate and supervise the work of the line and bureaus of the army . It should , according to the ruling of Secretary Baker , " pursue the execution of policy through the various bureaus . " The European Staffs have approximately the same functions . But a study of the governments , notably in England and . France , shows that the Staffs are equipped in a different way for all these duties . In the first place , the Chief of Staff of almost any of our Allies is a member of the supreme war council ? the body which roughly corresponds to our Council of National Defense . The European councils contain the men who have the information and authority to decide the large questions of Policy , and they do decide these questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not contain the Secretary of State , the Secretary of the Treasury , the chairman of the Shipping Board , the chairman of the War Trade Board or the Food Administrator . We have no executive officer of any sort in control of the manufacture of all munitions and supplies . The Council has recently developed into a conference by the inclusion of Mr. McAdoo , Mr. Hoover and Mr. Hurley . It merely confers , however ; it does not decide anything as a body . That may be because of the absence of the President ( the Premier of England and the President of France are members of the respective councils ) . At any rate , because the typical European council decides , and because the Chief of Staff is a member of it , he has real authority in the army . He can deliver the decisions of the council to the commanders in the field . He can plan the work of his own staff . It is different with us . When General Pershing thinks of our Chief of Staff , he thinks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other war bodies . General Bliss never confers , for instance , with Mr. Hurley of the Shipping Board , and none of his subordinates ever does . When Pershing wants to find out how many troops he can have by a certain date he has to refer to a program made up in the War Department . He can not be sure whether anyone ever asked the Shipping Board upon what expectation of transports and supply ships that program is based . He can not be sure whether the program for the requisite munitions has taken into account the steel that must be used for building those ships . He can not be sure that either program has been checked up with the labor supply . If circumstances arise which must alter the program , the chances are that nobody knows it , or that nobody remembers to tell everybody concerned until the physical scarcity of ships or labor obtrudes itself . The remoteness of the General Staff from the conduct of the war naturally disinclines the army to regard it as other than an aloof and secret body which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baluchistan , but is not to be consulted about large , immediate problems . In the second place , the European General Staffs present a strong front to the War Office . They have committees to study questions of organization , equipment , instruction , transportation and operation of the forces . These committees , under the Chief of Staff , make the decisions in military policy . The policies are then carried out in detail by the various bureau chiefs . There is , for instance , a Chief of Artillery who is responsible for the organization and instruction of the artillery branch and for the distribution of supplies to it . There is attached to him , among others , a member of the General Staff , who keeps him informed about the artillery policy of the Staff , and keeps the Staff informed about the work and needs of the Chief . of Artillery . There are similar Chiefs of Infantry , Signal Corps , Engineers and so on , and each chief is linked with the General Staff by a Staff officer . But no such simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Staff , to be sure , has its committees . . We have Chiefs of Signal Corps , Engineers and Coast Artillery . But no General Staff officers are attached to them . We have no chiefs of the main branches of the service ? Infantry , Cavalry and Field Artillery . We have a Chief of Ordnance , who is in charge of designing , purchasing and distributing guns and ammunition . But he is not in charge of the artillery 's organization and training . We have a Quartermaster General , in charge of buying and distributing to everybody general supplies and equipment . The executive work of the three main branches of the service is mostly done by the Adjutant General ? an officer who nominally is appointed to preside over the records . No representative of the General Staff is attached to the Chief of Ordnance , the Quartermaster General , or the Adjutant General . Just as the War College is physically remote from the War Department , so the General Staff is mentally remote from the bureau and division heads . One man is supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions from the Chief of Stan to the rest of the army ? the Adjutant General ; He existed before the General Staff was createa , and at times has held great administrative power ' The tradition of that power still lingers about the War Department . The decisions of the Chief 0t Staff are transmitted to the Adjutant General for distribution to the line and bureau chiefs . Our tions arising within the line or the bureaus inolv ing general policy are sent in to the Adjutant General , and it is within his discretion either t ? pass them up to the Chief of Staff , or to decide the ? 1 himself . Perhaps it is this uncertainty in the delegation of authority that causes some of the fusion , both in his office and elsewhere . In the European system the General Staff equipped to do the major planning , the coOrdiaat-ing and the following up . The bureau chiefs are equipped to do the work of executive detail that sort of work which Congress felt a vague need of keeping away from our General Staff when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our system , while the General Staff may or ma do the planning , it can not do the coordinating or the following up without cutting across the iivutti of the Adjutant General or of one of the hutea chiefs . On the other hand , it frequently attempts to do detailed work which might better be done by an executive trained in his special job . Two instances will make this clear . The Geri ; eral Staff makes a decision , let us say , W cha , re the number of cavalry units from 17 to 27 ? 101 , Quartermaster Corps hears of this change an i But mediately alters its buying to suit 27 units . 1 ; he the Ordnance Bureau does not take note uf decision for weeks , and goes on supplying 17 ? S , , Ilhe things have happened . Whose fault is it ? - the law says the General Staff must coordinate ? st bureaus , and Secretary Baker writes that it mu . arl ' pursue the execution of policy through the ous bureaus . " But the General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with either the Ordr13 , 0t Bureau or the Quartermaster Corps . It does ' of even contain in its membership a representative , he any of the purchasing bureaus . It notifies ' Adjutant General of its decision . It can co d0 more . The other instance is of a contrary xi ' rse , Should promotions be decided by seniority lection , and should the practice differ in December 22 , 1917 respect at home and abroad ? A ruling was the duty of the General Staff . But the drawing up of the complicated regulations was the duty of a specialized executive chief . Nevertheless the War College painfully and at length worked out a series of regulations ? which proved to be so imperfect that they had to be revised several times by the Adjutant General 's office . It is this sort of thing which makes officers , hesitant to send questions down the river . " It explains why many divisions never hear of the General Staff except when it issues orders that no officer may wear a " Sam Brown belt " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gilt bar on the shoulder . It would be a mistake , of course , slavishly to f ? 110w any European example . Perhaps our gov-'rninent can devise a new and better system . But it is interesting to see how well fitted the European ? rganizations are to give scope to the General Staff tctr the performance of the very duties We our General Staff is by law directed to perform . We 205 may remember , too , that England and France are democracies , that their armies are worthy of emulation , and that the American army is fighting in France beside them . The great and noticeable difference , however , between our War Department and both the British and French War Ministers is in the method of purchasing munitions . The French and British have both been forced , during the war , to take this duty away from the artillery chief and place it in a separate ministry . Neither wished to do so ; they were forced to do so by the inadequacy of the military arm to handle immense business problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch can satisfactorily distribute materials , without buying them , its capacity will be taxed to the utmost . Perhaps our problem is simpler than theirs . Perhaps we have better ordnance chiefs . Perhaps the Ordnance Bureau is now doing well enough . That subject must be discussed in another article . GEORGE SOULE . Politics in South Africa II - 'EXT to the native problem , the most impor-. , tarn , and at the moment by far the most urgent , question for South Africa is that of her future relations to the British empire . The question itself , of course , is common to all the members , ? , , t. the British " Commonwealth of Nations . " What is peculiar to . South Africa is the solution dWetnanded by the newly-formed and rapidly in-crea , sing " Nationalist " party . The nationalism of the other members of the empire is directed to-Iv 1,1.1cis the improvement of their political status ithin the empire . Egypt and India aim at in- ternal self-government . Canada and Australia , ai reacly self-governing , demand to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i.e. , the Avefaee-and-war policy of the empire . In South riea. alone the Nationalist movement aspires to separation from the empire . It seeks to secure r South Africa international recognition as a reign republic . of The movement may be described as a revival the national aspirations which the Boers sur-rendered in the Treaty of Vereeniging . The steps of revival , and the modification of these as- pir rations under the pressure of events , form the most interesting chapter of recent political history go South Africa . As soon as the grant of self- , , vernment , and the formation of the Union , had Put the Dutch in political control of the whole of united South Africa , two tendencies manifested themselves among the irreconcilables , ' who found a spokesman and leader in the Free State General , J. M. B. Hertzog . On the one hand , they sought to whittle down the obligations of South Africa to the empire . They raised an acrimonious discussion on the question ( then , apparently , purely academic ) whether South Africa had the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a European war . They put forward a doctrine of limited partnership or neutrality at will . On the other hand , they set themselves by a kind of racial segregation to preserve the Dutch race , language , and religion , and resist all assimilation to British ways . " The people , " on their lips , meant exclusively the Dutch inhabitants of South Africa , as distinct from " alien immigrants " ( the British ) and " colored trash " ( the native races ) . Whereas Botha was laboring to bring the two white races together , Hertzog strove to keep them apart . To Botha 's policy of " conciliation , " he opposed the doctrine of " two streams , " i.e. , of Dutch and British living side by side , each jealously guarding its national characteristics . Instead of the identification of imperial and South African interests , Hertzog preached up and down the veld that South Afrca should come first , and her interests ahvays be put before those of the empire . This direct challenge to Botha 's policy led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he organized his adherents into the Nationalist party . Had it not been for the European war , this
