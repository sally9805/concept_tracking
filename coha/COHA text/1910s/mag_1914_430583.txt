THE first experiment which a baby makes is connected with the force of gravity . It is born with an instinctive or ancestral dread of the unrestrained action of that force upon its own body ; and it is said to be able to cling with tenacity to a stick or branch of a tree . Later on it takes pleasure in dropping miscellaneous objects to see them fall ; perhaps to see if they all fall alike . And a very remarkable fact it is which is thus being observed ; the most familiar of all material facts , and one of the least understood ? least understood , that is , of all the simple physical facts which must surely be well within the limits of human comprehension . For if a philosopher is asked why all bodies tend to move toward the earth , and why they all fall with steady , equal acceleration unless retarded or checked somehow , he has to reply that he does not know . The idea that this familiar force of attraction is due in some way to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an idea became inevitable to any thinking naturalist who was aware that the earth is spherical , for the adverb " down " has then no other significance ? it can only mean toward the earth . It need not be ? indeed , it is not ? accurately toward the center , but it is along a plumb-line ? i.e. , along a vertical ; and that points very nearly to the center of the earth . Kepler was familiar with the force of gravity , and many of the Greeks must have realized that there was some sort of attraction between the earth and the things on it ; perhaps they guessed that that is what held the atmosphere on to it ; although the knowledge must have flickered and wavered - into extinction from time to time until permanently rekindled by Galileo . He it was who made the first careful experiments on falling bodies , showing that their velocity increased regularly with the time of fall ? in other words , that the acceleration was constant , and that it was independent of size and material . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so ultimately of clocks , put a powerful instrument of exact research into the hands of his successors . By means of pendulums with bobs of various kinds Newton tested and accurately verified the law that the acceleration of every kind of matter was identical in magnitude : a very remarkable fact , whose rationale remains to be discovered . It is commonly expressed by saying that weight is proportional to inertia or mass ; or it may be expressed by saying that the static measure of gravity corresponds to the kinetic measure . This means that whether forces are compared by the stretch they produce in a hit of elastic or a spring , or whether they are compared by the momentum they can generate or destroy in a given time , or by the masses in which they can produce the same acceleration , all the comparisons correspond . Yet one is a static method depending on the elastic properties of matter , the others are kinetic measures depending on Newton 's second law of motion . What is called " Hooke 's Law " governs the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " governs the second , or momentum , method ; and uniformity of experience by both methods gives confidence in the laws . Another simple , not to say babyish , experiment may here again be introduced . Take a number of similar marbles , and add one to a scale-pan hanging from a spiral spring or a piece of elastic . Note the stretch . Then add two . The stretch will be found to be double . Three will treble it , and so on . This  |p674  simplest possible relation between stress and strain is called " Hooke 's Law , " because in a great number of cases it was experimentally established by Robert Hooke in the seventeenth century . It holds for all elastic substances within certain limits of strain ? the limits beyond which they experience " a permanent set " ? i.e. , fail to recover completely when the load is removed . The fact gives us an easy and convenient static measure of force ? meaning by force always that which could be exerted by means of our muscles . Force , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct sensation and are primarily conscious . The other measure of force ? the kinetic method ? depends on the experimental fact that when different forces measured statically are applied successively to one and the same body , the acceleration it experiences is proportional to the force in each case . In other words , the ratio between force and acceleration , which is called the mass , or inertia , of any given body , is constant . The most accurate way of verifying this is to observe the isochronism of large and small vibrations of a body oscillating within the elastic limits . The fact that the rapidity of vibration of an elastic body is independent of the amplitude or range of its excursion must be practically familiar to all musicians ? indeed , to every listener to music ; for the pitch of a note does not depend on its loudness . A string gives the same note whether it be struck hard or gently . This fact really , though not obviously , verifies the law that force and acceleration are proportional . Thus , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a given piece of matter . Weights are commonly compared by a statical method , as by a spring balance : they are usually , indeed , compared merely by balancing one against another , either with or without leverage , as in various forms of balance and steelyard . The kinetic method of measuring force , when that is applied to the force of gravity , merely shows that it is exactly proportional to the inertia of the body acted on , and independent of everything else , for the acceleration produced by gravity in all bodies and every kind of matter is found to be the same , when properly tested ? i.e. , when disturbing causes are eliminated . It may be well to put this part of the doctrine in simpler fashion . It means merely that all things fall or tend to fall at the same rate . Many people are unaware that this is so , and are inclined to doubt it , though they can easily make the experiment for themselves . Take a pencil and a coin , or a book and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? or indeed any two objects as different as you please ? hold them up a little above the head and drop them together . They will ' fall and strike the ground together . That roughly verifies the law that weight and inertia are proportional to each other , or that weight is proportional to mass . In trying this experiment you may go out of your way to select things badly , things which are more subject to disturbing causes than others . Ordinarily , and unless you can try the experiment in a vacuum , aerial friction is a disturbing cause ; and if one of the things dropped has a lot of surface , like a bit of cotton-wool or a feather or a piece of paper , the fair fall under gravity is plainly interfered with . It will be all right in a vacuum , but in air the spreadout things will be retarded ? the undiluted effect of gravity will not be seen . But , then , this is only natural . Gravity would be interfered with still more if you dropped things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not fall at all , but would float . Even in air this happens with extremely light bodies , like a soap-bubble filled with coal-gas , or a hot-air balloon . But we need not thus confuse the issue by purposely introducing disturbing causes . Ordinary solid bodies are not much disturbed ; they do not greatly feel the obstruction offered by the atmosphere , unless they are dropped from a great height . At high speeds , aerial resistance becomes quite important . It is this which retards the speed of trains , and which every bicyclist encounters . The resistance experienced will depend upon  |p675  the amount of surface exposed to the friction ; and as wing-feathers are specially constructed to offer great resistance to moving quickly through the air , it is only natural that feathers and down are among the worst things for tests concerning falling bodies ; though , when the perturbing effect of the air is removed , and the experiment tried in a vacuum , the equal fall of a sovereign and a feather is an interesting and striking sight . In science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the art of the experimenter consists in eliminating all those which for the time he does not wish to attend to or be troubled with . In that way the complexity of nature can be lessened , and the abstract or selected statements called laws can be formulated , being thus either discovered or verified . Sometimes they are really arrived at by experiment de novo , or dissected out of observations , but more usually they are the result of hypotheses which must be submitted to experimental verification . People who decry hypotheses as a working method in science do not know what they are talking about . When Newton in a celebrated passage wrote concerning a definite case that he was not making hypotheses , but was establishing a proposition , there are people who imagine that he was guilty of the absurdly false statement that hypotheses were things which he never made ! One of the hypotheses which Newton made was that the familiar force of gravity which pulled down apples from a tree might be the very centripetal force which , in his system , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to regulate and account for the revolution of the moon around the earth . It took him some fourteen years to verify the actual truth of this hypothesis , by quantitative calculation and ascertained agreement with known results ; the delay was caused by imperfections in the data then available : the size of the earth was only approximately known . Meanwhile he worked out in extraordinary detail how gravity would act astronomically if it extended to the heavens and applied to heavenly bodies as it applies to terrestrial ones . Incidentally he succeeded in showing how the mass of the sun , and of any planet which possessed a satellite , could be measured in terms of that of the earth , if gravity were omnipresent ? i.e. , if universal gravitation were true . On the same principle he discovered theoretically the oblate shape of the earth , though it was a long time before that was verified . He went further and explained for the first time the long-known " Precession of the Equinoxes , " and the mysterious mechanism of the tides , all in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similarly with the perturbations and irregularities of lunar and planetary motion , and a multitude of other things -- treating them all with extraordinary , indeed almost superhuman , power . Ultimately , quantitative verification of his gravitational hypothesis became possible in the case of the moon ; and he perceived that ordinary familiar gravity applied universally to all matter and extended throughout the depths of space . The Principia could now be written on a firm vantage-ground of fact . But still , anything which confirmed his remaining hypotheses ? any experiment which could prove that gravity acted on every kind of matter equally , without regard to anything except its mass , became extremely important , and Newton took pains to verify this fact as exactly as possible by accurately timing the swing of pendulums made of various materials . Not only is the force of gravity , which we call weight , dependent simply on the mass of a body , without regard to its nature or chemical composition , but it is independent also of its physical state of aggregation . That is to say , a given quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be ascertained by exact experiment ) whether it be in the solid or liquid or gaseous state ; whether it be heated or cooled , boiled or frozen ; whether it be decomposed or burned , or whatever may be done to it : there seems literally no way of changing the force with which the earth attracts  |p676  it , except by either removing it farther from the earth or lowering it down a pit into its interior , in either of which cases the force diminishes in a perfectly simple and easily calculated manner . The weight of a body diminishes , whether it be taken up above the surface or be lowered beneath it . The latter diminution of weight is because some of the earth 's crust is now above the body and pulls it up instead of down . A thing weighs most at the earth 's surface . That a body should weigh a little less at the top of a mountain or in a balloon seems obvious enough , but that it should weigh rather less in a coal-pit is not so obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smaller earth ? an earth with a film of skin virtually removed . For Newton showed that inside the hollow of a uniform concentric spherical shell there would be no force at all , except what might be generated by pieces of matter inside that hollow . The best-known variation of weight is that caused by carrying a body from pole to equator , for that is equivalent to carrying it a little farther away from the main bulk of earth , because of its oblate shape . At any given place the weight of a given quantity of matter under all conditions is constant . The constancy of weight at a given place is a fact of vital importance as regards the nature of this universal force . It shows clearly that gravity is a property appertaining to atoms , and not to any molecular aggregation of atoms ; and we are beginning to suspect that it applies not only to atoms , but actually to the electrons of which ? on one prevalent hypothesis ? the atoms are in some sort composed . It certainly seems as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever that is . If an electron is a knot or straincenter in the ether , then in order to explain gravitation we must assume that the tying of that knot , or the production of that strain ? a thing at present entirely beyond our power ? sets up an extremely small but absolutely permeating state of strain , extending in every direction to infinity , its intensity varying inversely with the distance from the nucleus or center of force . A state of strain or tension thus set up , by every ultimate unit of matter in the act of its formation , would account for gravity . But , then , we have at present no other reason to suppose that such a strain would occur beyond the fact that things do attract one another . There must be some explanation of that fact ; and the - direction in which many are looking at the present time is to seek what is the real nature of an electron , and how it is related to the unaltered portion of the ether of space . When the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubted that it will some day be discovered , although the problem is very difficult ? the fact that its existence involves an attempted rarefaction of extremely small amount in the perfectly unrareliable and incompressible ether of space may be perceived . At any rate , that is what I , for one , expect . A mere guess or speculation of this kind is of course no explanation , but it indicates the direction toward which some at least are looking for an explanation , when the time is ripe . Meanwhile it may be interesting to realize how excessively small and residual such an effect need be in order to account for gravitation . The force exerted by one gram of matter on another gram , or , for that matter , by one ton upon another ton , is excessively small . Two ton-masses one yard apart attract each other with a force equal to the weight of one-eighth of a grain . That is an accurate statement , based upon what is known as " the Cavendish experiment , " whereby the attraction between a cannon-ball and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very delicate torsion arm , and after screening it from every kind of disturbing influence ? no easy matter ? measuring the microscopic shift in its position of equilibrium caused by the neighborhood of the cannon-ball , first on one side and then on the other , no other change of any kind being made . A - determination of this Newtonian gravitation constant ? i.e. , the force with which two known bodies attract each other at a given distance ? is also called " weighing the earth " ; because that which we ordinarily call " weight " is  |p677  really the force of attraction between two such bodies , of which one is the earth . Hence if the force with which a ton attracts a ton is measured and found to be one-eighth of the weight of a grain when the distance between them is a yard ; and if the force with which the earth attracts a ton is 2240 x 7000 x 8 times as much when the distance between them is 4,000 miles ? which is the average distance of the bulk of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the mass of the earth in tons can readily be calculated . It comes out just about **29;506;TOOLONG tons , the number of naughts being twenty-one . It is owing to this immense mass that the weight or force with which the earth attracts ordinary pieces of matter is so considerable . The force of attraction of a pound on a pound is small enough ? too small to observe without exceeding skill ? but the force of attraction when the vastness of a planet is involved may become something tremendous , so that all ordinary forces , like cohesion and the strength of materials , are hard put to it to hold their own . Much of civil engineering is concerned with successful utilization of and opposition to this great terrestrial attraction . When both masses are of astronomical magnitude the force of mutual attraction is still greater . The mutual pull between earth and moon , for instance ? far apart as they are ? is equivalent to what we , on the earth 's surface , call the " weight " of twenty thousand million million tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging from it would have to be of a preposterous thickness , reckoned in hundreds of miles . But on the other hand the force with which a pound of lead attracts a pound of iron or of clay or anything , at a distance of a yard , is only the fortymillionth part of the weight of a grain . If one of these pound-masses were fixed and the other left absolutely free to fall toward it , under the influence of their mutual attraction and subject to no other force whatever ? which would be a difficult experiment to carry out by reason of the multitude of disturbing causes ? the time taken to travel over the yard which separates them would be six and a half hours ; whereas under the attraction of the earth the same distance is traversed from rest in about half a second . But although so different in magnitude ? more different than the muscular pulls of a cheese-mite and an elephant ? the force and the motion in the two cases are essentially the same , and are due to the identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided up , and the movement examined from instant to instant , all the essential details of the motion in the two cases would be found the same . Whatever distance was traveled in the first instant , three times that distance would be traveled in the next , five times in the next , seven times in the next , and so on . The readiest way to observe this , in the case of the earth 's gravitation , is to arrange so that only a fraction of the weight is effective ? which can be done by many kinds of mechanical device , the simplest of which is an inclined plane . Mark off , therefore , successive distances , 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , etc. , by pegs on a long gently inclined plane or groove , and roll a billiard-ball down it . Then with some care adjust a metronome to tick as each peg is passed , allowing the ball to start exactly at one of the ticks . The times of travel over the increasing intervals will be exactly the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if carefully performed , gives good results ; and it can be used by a teacher to initiate a junior class into some idea of the law and order which is so universal throughout nature , but which superficial observation is apt to miss . Attempts to explain or discover the cause of gravitation have been numerous , and , while most of them are worthless , a few are ingenious and some important . The best known is that of Le Sage , of rushing through space and battering masses together . It may seem strange that such a hypothesis can possibly account for the apparent attraction of bodies ; but it  |p678  does , up to a certain point . It gives the law of inverse square and corresponds with other facts , but the difficulty is to show that the force would be proportional to the mass of the body and independent of its state of aggregation . Indeed , on this theory it would seem plausible that a flat body exposed edgeways to the stream should be differently affected from one exposing its full face ; so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weigh less than when it lies flat ? a thing never yet observed , nor likely to be observed , however precisely the weighing is done . It is just the way in which screening has to be worked out which constitutes the weak point of this theory . Bodies must screen one another to some extent in order to be beaten together by the bombardment of their exposed sides ; but on the other hand , bodies must screen one another very little , else other bodies in their neighborhood or between them would not be acted on , for they would be in a gravity shadow . A gravity shadow , so far as we know , is nonexistent ? so all observation shows ? and yet there must be screening enough to explain mutual attraction . This is a fundamental difficulty , only partially surmounted by the admitted extreme porosity of matter to small enough corpuscles ; and it seems fatal to every modification of Le Sage 's theory , such as the one urged by Mr. S. Tolver Preston on a basis of the kinetic theory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having particles of long free path rushing in all directions . To show how strenuously the difficulty of explaining gravity has been felt by natural philosophers , how urgent the need was for some explanation , and to what strange lengths they have been prepared to go in order to get a clue , we may instance Lord Kelvin 's theory , wherein he showed that if material bodies were immersed in an ocean of incompressible fluid , which fluid they kept on generating and emitting at a steady rate dependent on their mass , the surplus constantly flowing off to infinity ; or , conversely , if they were always absorbing and annihilating a similar fluid which was continually being supplied from infinity for their consumption then , in either of these cases they would be attracted toward one another with a force varying inversely as the square of the distance ; whereas if one body generated and another absorbed the fluid , they would repel one another . That seems to come out all right : but then it can not be said that creation and annihilation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has attracted a good deal of attention , and which is , on the face of it , more plausible , seeks to explain gravitation by waves in a medium . Robert Hooke , living in the Newtonian period , initiated this idea , because he found that bodies floating on the surface of water were gradually drawn toward a wave-center of disturbance . Many experimenters have noticed that a tuning-fork in vibration can attract pieces of paper . Lord Kelvin has investigated this also and has shown generally that wherever the motion of a fluid is greatest there the pressure is least . This may be regarded as a natural consequence of the conservation of energy ; for if kinetic energy goes up in value , potential energy must , go down . The law holds manifestly in the case of water or air rushing along a pipe of varying bore . At the narrow places , where the stream is rapid , the lateral pressure is less than in the wide places where the stream is sluggish ? just the opposite of what might popularly be expected . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream has often to flow against the pressure . ) Carrying this to extremes , we get the means-of producing a partial vacuum by a jet of air and so sucking up water . This device is applied in the ordinary spray-producer , as well as by steam engineers in Giffard 's injector . In illustration of this action it will be found that blowing vigorously with the mouth quite close to a flat piece of paper tends to lift or attract the paper or make it adhere to the mouth . Blowing through a tube ending in a flat disk , something like a stethoscope , shows the effect much better . Any one who protrudes the lips and tries to blow away a piece of paper held lightly against them will fail , until the distance is allowed to become great enough for the impetus of the wind to overcome the diminished  |p679  pressure . There is a vibratory theory of gravitation extant , therefore ; and it is sometimes illustrated experimentally by small hollow chambers , like elastic capsules , immersed in water and kept rapidly pulsating by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But to me it appears that vibration is not a sufficiently fundamental and unalterable property of matter to constitute a likely explanation of so extraordinarily fixed and permanent an effect as gravitation : that must surely depend on something constitutional and deeply imbedded in the very existence of the ultimate unit of matter . So we are driven back to the idea of a tension in the ether , set up at the moment when an electron came into existence ! But how an electron can be brought into existence , or what an electron is , we do not know , though we may not always remain ignorant . Newton himself , however , perceived that such a tension ? if it could be deduced as an inseparable consequence of matter , or if its existence could be otherwise demonstrated ? would do what was wanted . For in his " Optical Queries " ? those interesting suggestions in the interrogative form which are appended to editions of his Optics issued late in life ? he shows that if the pressure of this medium is less in the neighborhood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies will be drawn toward one another ; and that if the diminution of pressure is inversely as the distance from the dense body , the law will be that of gravitation . " The next step , as he points out , is to account for this inequality of pressure in the medium ; and as he was not able to do this , he left the explanation of the cause of gravity as a problem to succeeding ages . " So says Clerk-Maxwell . The problem is just as biting now as it was when that was written , and perhaps its difficulty is intensified rather than alleviated by the enormously stronger electric attractions and repulsions which are now known to occur between electrons and between electrically charged atoms ? the latter being the forces of chemical affinity . For between the smallest material units the electric attraction is , so to speak , infinitely stronger than any- gravitation attraction ; we are not really sure that electrons gravitate at all . Their gravitation , if it exists ? as I think it probably does ? must be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to sign . It is singular that there is no known gravitational repulsion , that it is all attraction : that there is not a principle of " levity " as well as a principle of " gravity " ! Some have surmised that in the course of ages all the matter which repelled our kind has absented itself and gone into the uttermost parts of infinity . But surely some might have been mechanically entangled or entrapped for our edification . Most likely , however , no such general repulsion exists . Electrical repulsion exists , of course ? an electrostatic force depending on the first power of electrostatic charge and therefore depending on the sign of that charge ? but in addition to this large effect there may be a minute residue or surplus depending on some even power of the charge , a residue excessively , hopelessly minute . We can reckon that the gravitational force between two electrons , at any distance apart , is to their electrical attraction or repulsion at the same distance in the ratio of 1 to 1,000,000,000 , - 000,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being fifteen . Yet if such an almost infinitesimal but unalterable uniform constant residue of stress should ever be shown to be produced in the , ether by the very existence of the singularity in it which we call an electron ? or whatever the unit of matter may turn out to be ? then the whole business of astronomy can be worked , and the gigantic forces between sun and planets will be accounted for . For electrical forces , however relatively enormous , cancel out in the aggregate because they are of opposite sign ; but the ridiculously small gravitational residue goes on piling itself up ? nothing interfering with it or diminishing any part of it ? until the mutual force of planetary gravitational attraction becomes millions of millions of tons .  |p680
