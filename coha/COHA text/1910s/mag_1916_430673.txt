A LTHOUGH the end of the war is entirely conjectural , various writers are already speculating about its aftermath . Some of the economists predict that the process of rehabilitation will bring great industrial activity and that a period of general prosperity will then ensue . While commercial writers hold conflicting views , they take it for granted that the impetus gained by the United States will ensure our prosperity for some years to come . Germany 's future depends upon her ability to regain her foreign mar kets and overcome the antipathy of her present opponents by appealing to their " enlightened self-interest " ; in other words , by underselling her competitors . The actual property damage done by the war is perhaps relatively small , but the waste of human life is enormous , and the effect on the labor markets of the world may be serious . One of the results will probably be a check to the development of new lands and to colonial expansion . In the field of Art and Literature , it is confidently expected that educated people will turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading of books , and that there may be a Renaissance somewhat similar to that which marked the peace of Europe in the Sixteenth Century , only that it will be much greater in proportion to the great numbers of people in all civilized countries who have been given cultural rudiments through popular education . Some thinkers prophesy a general religious revival on the theory that the war has turned the thoughts of men to the serious issues of life and death ; that millions of stricken families crave the consolation of the church ; and in those countries which have been engrossed in the war , living has become simpler and more natural than before , and there is an earnestness which is preparing the ground like a fallow field for the seed the preacher sows . If history is any guide ,  | however , the world 's great wars have brought a rationalistic trend which is likely in this age to be marked by a growing impatience with unessential dogma , and with the meddlesome interference with those habits of men and women that are not in themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men in the ranks of the fighting nations upon the social structure and to what extent , in those nations where they are articulate , will they be a political factor ? One recalls the dominating influence of the Grand Army of the Republic for at least twenty years after the Civil War in the United States . Men in camp learn the value of discipline , but they learn also the power of organization and co-operation , and in modern warfare they acquire habits of self-reliance . The very attrition of their intimate contact with all sorts and conditions of men who are their comrades may have a clarifying effect upon sectarian institutions of the narrower sort , and possibly upon political partisanship . May we not anticipate that religious teaching will tend towards something more masculine and robust than it is today , at least in those Protestant Churches which claim the greatest numerical strength ? Is not the continued hold of the Catholic Church upon its men due in some part to the fact that it understands the lives of the masses and does not try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three years ( at least ) of army life make men less intellectually submissive and , in some respects , more tolerant than they were before ? Democracy itself is on trial in this gigantic struggle , though none of the nations at war which boasts of adherence to democratic standards presents the appearance of a democracy today . Each looks forward eagerly to the day when peace will permit the resumption of the old ways . Yet it may be doubted whether the old system will ever be restored in whole anywhere . The war has certainly revealed in a striking way the value of solidarity , and when the last shots shall have been fired it is entirely likely that democratic ideals will be discussed in the light of a new knowledge and that the peoples of the war-ravaged lands will think and act much  | more from the community standpoint than before , finding perhaps a truer and larger liberty in providing first for the welfare and comfort of all . Not only in economic operations , but also in social observances is this likely to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a result of the war , will come more searching analyses of all social situations and more accurate and efficient systems of regulation . All of these questions are important in attempting to forecast the probable developments of the next decade in the handling of the " drink " problem . Even in this country we are learning to " think in continents , " and there is an increasing and wholesome disposition to learn what other nations are doing . Let us take up first of all the war measures in relation to alcohol : Russia prohibited vodka for mobilization purposes , with bitter memories of the drunkenness which marked the opening of the Russo-Japanese War , but the movement has been accepted with an unexpected acquiescence , or at least without any very marked resentment , so far as one can learn at this time , and in the rural districts it is said to be really popular . But political leaders seem to fear that after the war is over there will be a reaction . The increase in illicit distilling has already become so widespread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Duma is , however , considering constructive plans which will stimulate the native wine industry and encourage the use of light beers . It seems to be taken for granted that the government will not revive the vodka monopoly , though it is feared that the complete prohibition of spirits will not work , and that some vent must be found which will keep the sale of them under strong control without attempting their absolute suppression . Possibly this may take the form of a limited sanction for hotels , restaurants and bona fide clubs , which would still keep vodka out of the hands of the laboring class . At the present time , local communities are given the optional right to permit the sale of fermented beverages , and the Minister of Commerce recommends that the sale of beer and wine containing not more than rz per cent of alcohol be permitted .  | In the German Empire and throughout Austria Hungary the output of the breweries has been cut down arbitrarily to conserve the barley supply , though at the saute time the brewers are compelled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army . The German military authorities evidently feel that a regular supply of beer is essential to the welfare of their troops . Certainly no one can claim that it has interfered with their efficiency ! France and Italy have not made any drastic changes in their liquor legislation since the war began , the fighting men being given a regular ration of wine wherever it can be conveniently transported . The leaders of the temperance movement in France are seeking to secure discrimination both through taxation and legislation in favor of what they call " the hygienic beverages , " which include wine , beer , cider and perry . One of the most serious and difficult problems in France is the enormous extent of household distillation . Any household may make five gallons for home use free of taxes , but the supervision is lax , and in the rural places thousands of persons manufacture spirits for sale illegally . Recent British developments are of great significance to the United States . In no country has more drastic action been taken along the line of industrial socialization . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the government , but the mines , the munitions works and the workers themselves are now either publicly operated or are under governmental control . The main motive is to speed up the manufacture of munitions , and it is this motive alone that is back of the creation by the government of a public commission to control the liquor business in the " munitions areas , " a term which is apparently elastic enough to cover all manufacturing centers . The initial efforts of the Board of Control were directed to the reduction of the hours of sale in public houses , the abolition of the treating system , and in general a stricter supervision of all licensed premises . The latest developments indicate that it is the purpose of the government to secure complete control of the manufacture nil sale of all alcoholic beverages in certain specified places , ul soine of the leaders in the temperance movement are even talking of complete nationalization of the retail sale of Iuors . The Temperance Legislation League , of which Messrs . Rowntree and Sherwell are the moving spirits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removing the obstacle of private financial interests . " This is to be brought about by state purchase , which implies reasonable compensation for the present license ho olders . In a recent article , Mr. Arthur Sherwell says that " st ; a t e purchase , in the view of the League , is a means to an end the consequences from which could , and in this country would , be controlled and determined by the force of public opinion . The nation , for the first time since the Sixteenth Century , would be free to adapt its licensing arrangements to public convenience and demand . " Whatever the result of the Board of Control 's experiments may be , there is no substantial sentiment for prohibition in Great Britain , though there is a rapidly growing sentiment for changes in the character of the drinking places so that the sale of strong drinks may be only incidental to the public house instead of being its entire raison d'etre . A body of noted men in England organized what is known as the Public House Trust , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common sense busitness lines . Their standpoint is that the licensed house is a practical necessity , and that it ought always to be a place to which all classes and all the people can resort without reproach . This organization has secured the control of some 3(x) licensed houses , where during the past ten years it has been computed that more than i r , 000,000 persons have been served , and not a single prosecution for drunkenness or any other evil has resulted . The system assumes the indispensability of the licensed house in some shape or form for the purpose of reasonable refreshment , rest , recreation and social intercourse . The trust houses are run under " disinterested management , " which means that the manager is not interetited financially in pushing the sale of alcoholic drinks and  | the company is limited to a profit of 5 per cent on its invest bent . In European countries that are not engaged in the wa r a number of practical measures have been adopted which are designed to divert the consumption to the mildest ale ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ) en mark , and Sweden , beer containing 2% per cent of alcohol by weight ( equal to 2.86 by volume ) is free from taxation . Little Iceland , which is under absolute prohibition , forbids the manufacture , importation and sale of all spirituous drinks containing more than 2% weight per cent of alcohol . The Norwegian Alcohol Commission ( which is an official body under the chairmanship of Prof. Dr. Axel Hoist ) , after four years of investigation , issued its report last year . The majority of the Commission urged the advisability of fighting against the misuse of alcoholic beverages instead of forbidding all use of them . They find that conditions may be improved by other means than total prohibition , which , they say , is likely to increase home distillation and to stimulate the illicit traffic . The Swedish Temperance Commission , which is also an official body , has recently recommended legislation which would put the entire monopoly of the retail traffic , except in the sale of 2j4 per cent beers , in the hands of the Bolags . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for spirit selling , but their profits are liiii ited to the ordinary rate of interest on the capital invested . Norway has a progressive class system of taxing beer , according to its strength , in three groups : i . The 2% per cent beers , which are in a privileged class and are practically tax free . 2 . The beers which run up to 33/4 per cent and are taxed moderately . 3 . The beers which run between 3% per cent and 5 ' ; per cent alcohol and are taxed quite heavily . Each bottle as it is sold must have its class marked o m it , and the system provides a simple and cheap control which follows the article from its origin to its consumption all over the cnuntrv . " I'he object of the system is gradually to move the consumption of alcohol from the strongest to the lightest drinks . The next step will be to adopt the same system as to all other alcoholic beverages.  |p464  It is impossible within the limits of a magazine article to go into more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who are leading the temperance movement in the principal European countries realize that prohibition is impractical and that the sane thing to do is to encourage the sale of mild beers and light wines as much as possible , and to keep the sale of spirits under the strictest possible restriction and control . Along with this is a well developed movement to change the character of what we should call the saloon from that of a mere drinking place to a public resort for both sexes , where cheap and satisfying food is served as well as all sorts of beverages . The moderate use of light beers and wines is not regarded as injurious , but , on the contrary , is generally considered beneficial . There is a common sense distinction between the beverage-use of such articles as beers and light wines which are freely and commonly taken with meals and the stronger drinks which are frequently used as aperitifs or " bracers . " ( Of course it is true that many men take their whiskey highly diluted in the form of highballs with their meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this practice is certainly not general among the mass of the people . ) In some of the largest continental factories an industrial canteen is maintained , where beer is furnished with lunch on the factory premises at noontime . Is there not a lesson in all this for lawmakers and reformers in this country ? No attempt has been made by them to discriminate between liquors according fo their : dro holic contents , and so great is their rancor that iii several prohibition States it is unlawful to make or sell any milt beverage , even though it is so dealcoholized as to have no alcohol in it ! If the question has been one of taxation or the imposition of license fees , their guiding principle has simply been what the traffic will stand ! In a word , the motive of legislation has been either purely fiscal or one of suppression . There are some curious anomalies in recent prohibitory laws .  |p465  Several States which have prohibited the manufacture or sale of all malt and vinous beverages refuse to allow the sale of a dealcoholized malt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has been made sacro-sanct by Mr. Bryan 's benediction ! The average American beer contains 3/ per cent of alcohol by volume . No doubt the percentage might be lessened , but it is doubtful if a thoroughly first class beer of very much lighter gravity can be made which will stand the test of shipping to distant points and keep perfectly palatable under all sorts of storage conditions and climatic changes . At any rate , the so-called " near-beers " do not satisfy habitual drinkers , and fail therefore to divert the consumption from " hard drinks , " as real beer does . The saloons in our large cities must do a large trade to pay their overhead expenses , which probably average fully four thousand dollars a year . Their customers , who are very numerous , seem fairly well satisfied with the existing conditions , and it is doubtful if they would welcome any radical change such as the exclusion of spirits . Obviously a saloon which sold only certain beverages would be at a disadvantage in competition with the place where the customer can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " will ever lift itself by its own bootstraps and introduce any startling changes by its own voluntary action is doubtful . The leaders in all branches of the liquor business realize that , except in the manufacturing centers , there is a , strong sentiment against the standing bar saloon as it is generally conducted at present . Probably 90 per cent of the saloons are decently conducted today , and it would be an easy matter to close the others if the authorities were in earnest about it , but ? this would not solve the problem . Profiting by experience in some of the European countries I have mentioned , would it not be possible to make a number of demonstrations in those States that are now dry , which have already gone through the costly tearing-down process , and are in a position to start all over again ?  |p466  Is it futile to dream of a place where the beer pump and the soda fountain shall be so close together that one man can work them both ? The best field for experimentation is undoubtedly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cities in prohibition territory are thoroughly dissatisfied with the present conditions . Though they may be opposed to the saloon , they are eager to put a stop to the present illicit traffic and are ready for a reasonable remedy . Most of them would welcome legislation which would permit the sale of beer and light wines in restaurants ( including bona fide clubs and reputable hotels ) . Care should be taken to avoid overstimulation of the business by so limiting licenses that they will be determined solely by the reasonable convenience of the public . Under such a system the State would naturally be committed to the principle of local self-government by giving each community the right to determine the matter for itself . In re-establishing this plan , however , it would be wise to provide that no change should be made by any local community unless 6o per cent of the vote was cast in favor of it . Under such a plan the individual would still have the right to have any beverage shipped to him from outside the State for his personal use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the State . The successful operation of this plan in several States would be so widely commented upon that the movement would soon spread , and it would pave the way for radical reforms of a general nature in many other States . Such a plan would lend itself easily to other experiments along the line of the Public House Trust Companies of England , or even to municipal restaurants . People are beginning to realize the futility of national prohibition and the staggering police problem which it would involve . If it takes ioo , 000 troops to police the Mexican frontier against bandits , how many would it take to police all our frontier and coast lines against whiskey smuggling ? It is well known that the State authorities have done practically nothing in the prohibition States in the South to put down moonshining , which , from a sporadic affair between  |p467  neighbors , has now , under the impetus of prohibition , be come an organized traffic . Uncle Sam 's revenue officers are the only police force that the moonshiner fears , and they rely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor whites for the sake of the reward the govern ment gives . Our prohibition legislation has resulted in stimulating the illegal traffic beyond the bounds of control . The time is ripe for constructive measures , but the various temperance bodies in the United States seem to vie with each other in their bitter radicalism , and it is evidently futile to look to them for any practical remedy . The Anti-Saloon League , which has absorbed the activities of the older bodies and claims ? with some truth ? to monopolize the prohibition cause , has no program except destruction . On the other hand , the liquor trade ( in spite of its group of enlightened leaders ) is not ready yet to make sacrifices involved in drastic licensing reforms , and it is obvious that any legislation which bears the tag of an " interest " is foredoomed to defeat . Mr. Fabian Franklin has recently pointed out the monstrous falsity of the opinion " that nobody is concerned in the matter except the prohibitionists on the one hand and those who make money out of liquor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American people are temperate in their habits , and are so thoroughly alive to the importance of the liquor prob lem that they are ready and waiting for leadership which promises definite results . Thoughtful men , the men of vision , who must be relied on to mould public sentiment , will have a great opportunity and responsibility in dealing with this world problem after the war is over .  |p468
