txt Oklahoma 's State Warrants . I have just read your editorial article on the City of Atchison . Kan. , bond situation . It reminded me that I have some Oklahoma State warrants , payment on which has been refused , and upon which no interest has been paid for two years . Before buying same I took the precaution to write to the State Treasurer asking if they were good . His deputy replied that they were , and that they would be paid within eight or ten months with Interest at 6 per cent . This was two years ago . The Senator front Oklahoma seems to be the Chief Mogul in molding our new Currency bill . This seems to me like a joke . Let us hope that the currency he proposes to give us will be better than his State warrants .
