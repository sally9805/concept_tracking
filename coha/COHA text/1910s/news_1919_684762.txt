txt PERSHING 'S UNMILITARY CRITICS . To the Editor of The New York Times : Representative Bland , Republican , of Indiana , is quoted as saying , " If . General Pershing did n't know more about the disposition of sugar than he did about the front line , it would be useless to plc him , I found . him 200 miles from the front on July 10 , 1915 , when the battle of Chateau-Thierry was at its height . " Such a slurring remark as the foregoing as to the whereabouts of the C. in C. of the American forces in France is entirely uncalled for and shows very plainly how narrow-minded and unpatriotic some of our public servants are . If General Pershing was 200 miles in the rear , it may be taken for granted that his presence was required there . No one point of the line required his personal attention any more than the hundreds of others . What can it matter if he was 200 miles or 2,000 miles in rear of the line if he had proper communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stray shell had " sent him west , " would anything have been gained ? I would suggest that in the next war a few of the gentlemen from Washington get up near the front and direct operations where the Generals are afraid to go . Also that credit be given to whom it Is due and that unnecessary remarks and criticisms be left unsaid . GERALD F. mcGiatISEY . Mount Vernon , N. Y. , Oct. 28 , 1919 . SAVE MONROE 'S HOUSE . To the Editor cf The New York Times : The appeal contained in your editorial article of Oct. 25 for the preservation of the James Monroe house In New York City should receive the support not only of patriotic and historical societies but of all who realize the true value of our rapidly vanishing landmarks . The loss of these memorials , many of which are of ? distinct architectural interest , as , for example , St. John 's Chapel , lately destroyed , is too apt to be disregarded in the absence of such timely expressions of appreciation and warningas your editorial contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings possess not merely a sentimental value , but where they have some direct association with historical events or personages they can exercise an important educational influence , especially when situated , as is most frequently the case , in the older sections of our cities now given over largely to our foreign-horn population . Properly restored and maintained , they may thus be made object lessons in American history and in teaching the principles and ideals upon which our Government is founded . The purchase of the Octagon house at Washington by the American Institute of Architects guarantees the preservation of that monument where the Treaty of Ghent was signed during its occupancy by President James Madison , and it would be to the credit of New York if the home of Madison 's successor , President Monroe , could , as you suggest , be secured and maintained in commemoration of the times and events with which his name is associated . HORACE WELLS SELLERS . Philadelphia , Oct. 29 , 1919 . A LACK OF ARMY STORES . To the Editor of The New York Times : Regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good old U. S. A. discriminate against the soldier who served her in France and cater to the Man who did n't go ? The latter class was amply forewarned by the Government that the country was going " dry " and was given every opportunity legally to supply himself for the desert we all must cross , and was protected by law in having same in his possession and using It . Having served as a . Captain in the A. E. F. , and having landed in America and been discharged after wartime prohibition went into effect , the writer finds himself in the former clans , which comprises a few hundred thousand men who risked their all for the preservation of America 's ideals of liberty . They , however , were not permitted to supply themselves , and were therefore denied the right of having in their possession something the other man was protected by law in having in his possession . WILLIAM R. TURNER . Norwich , N. Y. , Oct. 29 , 1019 . THE MOST EXPENSIVE CITIES . To the Editor of The New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports that my capital , Stockholm , is the most expensive city in which to live . These statements are , however , to my mind , considerably exaggerated . Prices here are about the ' same . At the present rate of exchange I get in Sweden for SI four Swedish croars , and here for four Swedish crowns $1 . In New York I get a good room at a hotel for $3.50 and in Stockholm at a fine hotel for twelve to fourteen crowns . In New York restaurants I get an ordinary lunch for about t ; .1 and in Stockholm for about four crowns . In the show windows I see the prices are about the same . I can get a pair of ordinary shoes for $10 and in Stockholm for forty crowns . Perhaps prices here are a little higher than in Stockholm . but there is a great exception , that of street car fares .
