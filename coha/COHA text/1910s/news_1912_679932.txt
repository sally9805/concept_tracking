txt Mayor Gaynor , the principal speaker at the dinner last night of the new American Society for Promoting Efficiency , held at the Aldine Association , startled his audience by declaring that " the judiciary of this country is the worst department we have , " and by prophesying the speedy " recall " of some recent Court of Appeals decisions . The Mayor said that the delays of modern judicial decisions and the technicalities on which they rested have become so notorious as almost to keep the general public of this . State have tried to have passed in the last four years , and which have been declared " unconstitutional " by the Court of Appeals because they deprived the workman of their " liberty " without due process et law . Mayor Gaynor then proceeded to explain his view of what the word " liberty " in the Constitution really means , He said : " These absurd decisions of the Court of Appeals , which talk about a laborer 's ' property right to work . ' and working women 's ' property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down soon like a pack of cards . Enlightened public opinion in this country is n't going to stand for them much longer . I prophesy that these Court of Appeals decisions are going to be recalled by the representatives of the people at the very next Constitutional convention . " Eight hundred and fifty corporation officials , college professors , statisticians and sociological experts assembled here from all over the country , organized the new society yesterday . Its officers say It is going to carry on a nation-wide campaign " to promote efficiency In every activity of man . " The eight hundred and fifty efficiency seekers held morning and afternoon sessions in the Engineering Societies building in West Thirty-ninth Street , during the course of which a constitution was adopted for the society and several papers were read by the heads of various corporations on how greater industrial efficiency may be obtained . In the evening there was a dinner at the Aldine Association , at which letters urging greater efficiency in public life were read from President Taft and Gov . Dix , and speeches were made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ von L. Meyer of the Navy , Herbert Knox Smith , U. S. Commissioner of Corporations , and Dr. Frederick A. Cleveland , director of President Taft 's efficiency commission . President Taft 's Letter . This letter from President Taft to James G. Cannon , Chairman of the Organization Committee of the Efficiency Society , was read by Dean Joseph Franch Johnson of the School of Commerce : The White House , Washington . March 15 , 1912 . My Dear Mr. Cannon : - I regret very much that a previous engagement prevented my attending the meeting of your society on the evening of the 18th . I am in hearty accord with the purpose of the new-born American Society for the Promotion of Efficiency . I understand that effort will be made to outline improvements In Government business , as well as in the different varieties of private enterprises . Such a movement , spread over the whole United States , can not fail to improve the efficiency and contribute materially to the general welfare . Every ounce of our productive power which Is saved should contribute to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It realizes even a small per cent . of its ideals , will prove of the greatest value to the Nation , and I tender my hearty good wishes to the society and its membership for their success . Sincerely yours , WILLIAM H. TAFT . Mr , James G. Cannon , Chairmanship American Society for Promoting Efficiency , New York City . Praise from Gov . Dix . Gov . Dix 's le-.ter , also read aloud by Dean Johnson , was in part as follows : I am keenly disappoin.ted at my inability to attend the inaugural meeting of the American Society for Promoting Efficiency . From the receipt of your first communication in December last , I had anticipated the pleasure of personally participating in the organizing of a society along the lines stated in your letter . It has long been apparent to me that one great need of modern times in our American life is to augment the efficiel cY of human endeavor by conserving and intelligently directing the energies of men as applied to opportunity . Whether In the realm of Government . or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agriculture , there has been a prodigal waste of effort and material which constitutes a tremendous National loss . I believe that a society ' inch as you are to-day organizing can be made a State and National asset Of immeasurable value . The wonderful potential forces in our Nation  --  in its transportation Interests , its financial , industrial , commercial , and agricultural possibilities  --  demand the application of an intelligent citizenship directed along wellorganized channels of enlightenment and education . We have too long stood before the world as an example of inefficiency through the waste of effort and resources . This waste and National loss has expressed itself in numberless ways , and in none more strikingly than in ruthless and ruinous competition and in destructive conflicts between employers and employes . Loss in Efficiency Decrease . In the conduct of governmental affairs ? whether National , State , or municipal  --  there is appalling loss to the people , through decrease of efficiency bred by the lack of proper systems of co-ordination and of organization and management . The great function of efficiency is to transform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order are the handmaidens which will bless mankind by making " two blades of grass grow where but one grew I before . " I predict for the American Society for Promoting Efficiency a future full of honor to the pioneers in its organization and freighted with benefit to the people of our State and Nation . Mayor Gaynor began his speech by taking what the diners seemed to think was a rap at Col. Roosevelt 's . Presidential boom . " The pest of this country . " he said , " can be summed up in the statement . : hat every American citizen thought he knew everything and that he was efficient in all directions . The starting of this society shows that some of us ? are getting over th1.1 idea , but , judging from what is going on just now in America , others of 115 have n't mended very much . Men have no hesitancy in coming out and announcing themselves candidates for Mayor or Governor or President . Its ludicrous that they ca n't sit down and let you and I announce Lheir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for themselves . If they are so fit for those places we ought to be able to see their fitness . I hope from now on they 'll be silent . Those of us who ask nothing for ourselves can at least ask that , ca n't we ? Gaynor 's Mayoralty Aims . " But that is the way all public offices used to be filled , and the problem of getting efficiency in public office is also hampered by the newspaper editors , who think they know everything , and that no one else knows anything . My one great object when I became Mayor was to take the twenty-six bureaus to which the Mayor appoints the heads , and , in spite of political and partisan dissatisfaction , to select some one for each of the twecty-six offices with particular efficiency . I think in some measure I succeeded . it You only read the Hearst rag-bag newspapers you 'll probably think that I turned the city over to a lot of vagabonds . But twenty-two of my twenty-six department heads are graduates of great colleges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all twenty-six are gentlemen and scholars . I see , however , that I am to speak on the subject of ' Efficient Methods in Legal Procedure and Practice , ' and I want to state quite frankly that the judiciary of this country is the worst department we have . The trials are not only long , but the uncertainty of results almost deter people from going into court . There is no excuse for all this delay of the law , in my opinion . In the courts of London a case comes up one month and is literally tried and disposed of the next month . That is because the English Judges are so trained and so efficient . " But here the delay of the law has long been a grievance , both in this community and elsewhere . The decisions are technical , delayed , uncertain . Even when You get a judgment there is the appeal , which Is a regular tug of war . There is the splitting of hairs by the higher courts , the Judges of which form their opinions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jury too much , ' and such theories . Judges Do n't Understand . " As for the technicalities of the criminal courts , they are appalling . The Judges themselves and most of the people at large do n't understand that the legal Phrases on which these modern harmful technicalities are based really grew out of merely the good intentions of the Judges of several centuries ago , who wanted to avoid giving prisoners the extreme penalties of the old laws . " Larceny , for example , in England was once punishable by death . So the Judges in England got into the way of inventing excuses to be lenient , not wishing to condemn a poor petty thief to death . A man once stole a dog : In those days of the old English law , aria a humane Judge , not believing that a man should die for a. dog , ruled that a dog was not property , because a dog was a wild animal . So now even to this day it is a great question in law as to whether a dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , where law Is understood and efficiently administered , all these old legal technicalities have been swept away . But our forefathers brought them over here from England and we have them all still . American *Judges of the higher courts will now reverse a decision on a technicality of the law even if they think and confess to each other that the technicality Is " ' It seems to us trivial , ' they have actually been known to say to each other , ' but we ca n't tell what effect the knowledge of this technicality may have had on the Judge and Jury in the lower court . ' ? ' AB though the Judges and Juries in the lower courts were fools . Of late years the judiciary of this country has also caused much inefficiency in the other departments of  --  the Government . The fact that some of these Judges are about TO years old may have had something to do with this . Benevolent persons several years ago went to the east side of this city and saw children falling ill because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes . The benevolent persons caused a law to be passed by the State Legislature prohibiting the manufacture of cigars in tenements . The Court of Appeals , however , declared this humanitarian law unconstitutional . That word , unconstitutional ! How often it is said , arid so few understand what it means . Court of Appeals Eloquent . " The Judges of the Court of Appeals said that the humanitarian law was unconstitutional because it interfered with the ' liberty ' of the tenement folk in preventing them from doing what they wanted in their own homes . They grew quite eloquent , those Judges did . We 'll show that we know all about those words about liberty and due process of law in the Constitution , ' they said . Butthose Judges did n't apparently know that the word liberty in our Constitution was taken from the Magnas-Charta which some Bishop whose name I 've forgotten drew up hundreds of years ag ' ,  --  " The Bishop meant by the word liberty only physical liberty . But the Court of Appeals issued a sort of constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is the mistake that is constantly being made . More recently other benevolent people found that the east side bakeries were insanitary , that the bakers worked in extreme heat , breathed flour , and so forth . The benevolent people passed a law regulating the hours and sanitary conditions of the bakery business . " But the highest court in the State declared this law unconstitutional because it interfered with the bakery employes ' property right to work . ' " Enlightened public opinion is n't going to stand for it . Recently the Legislature shifted the responsibility for unremovable risks in the employers ' liability law from the workmen to the employers . And the Court of Appeals again decided to_the teach us how wise they were . They declared this statute unconstitutional because it takes away liberties without due process of law . " The only relief the general public has against such decisions is to enact the laws It wants as constitutional amendments . Constitutional amendment is the real power of ' recall ' which the people have . I prophesy that all these Court of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutional convention . " Mayor Gaynor was followed by Secretary of Navy Meyer , who described the efforts he has made to place the Navy Department on a higher plane of efficiency . He said in part : " Navy yards can not be scientifically managed to the greatest advantage so long as the Secretary is hampered by lack of power to use the moneys appropriated to the best advantage . The yards must be organized and managed so as to promote military efficiency , and it is necessary that the yards produce results which will increase the military value of the fleet , for the fleet is the navy .
