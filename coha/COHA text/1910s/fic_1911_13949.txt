The scene shows a comfortable living-room in an old house . The furniture was brought to America by PETER GRIMM 'S ancestors . The GRIMMS were , for the most part , frugal people , but two or three fine paintings have been inherited by PETER . A small , old-fashioned piano stands near the open window , a few comfortable chairs , a desk with a hanging lamp above it , and an arm-chair in front of it , a quaint old fireplace , a Dutch wall clock with weights , a sofa , a hat-rack , and mahogany flower-pot holders , are set about the room ; but the most treasured possession is a large family Bible lying on a table . A door leads to a small office occupied by PETER 'S secretary . Stairs lead to the sleeping-rooms above . Through the window , hot-houses , beds of tulips , and other flowers , shrubs and trees are seen . " Peter Grimm 's Botanic Gardens " supply seeds , plants , shrubbery and trees to the wholesale , as well as retail trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An old Dutch windmill , erected by a Colonial ancestor , gives a quaint touch to the picture . Although PETER GRIMM is a very wealthy man , he lives as simply as his ancestors . As the curtain is raised , the room is empty ; but CATHERINE is heard singing in the dining-room . JAMES HARTMAN , PETER 'S secretary , opens his door to listen , a small bundle of letters in his hand . He is a well set up young man , rather blunt in his manner , and a trifle careless in his dress . After a pause , he goes back into the office , leaving the door ajar . Presently CATHERINE enters . In spite of her youth and girlish appearance , she is a good , thrifty housekeeper . She wears a simple summer gown , and carries a bunch of gay tulips and an old silver pitcher , from which she presently pours water into the Harlequin Delft vase on PETER GRIMM 'S desk . She peeps into the office , retreating , with a smile on her lips , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James ? p. 3 HARTMAN On the threshold . No indeed . CATHERINE Do you like your new work ? HARTMAN Anything to get back to the gardens , Catherine . I 've always done outside work and I prefer it ; but I would shovel dirt rather than work for any one else . CATHERINE Amused . James ! HARTMAN It 's true . When the train reached the Junction , and a boy presented the passengers with the usual flower and the " compliments of Peter Grimm "  --  it took me back to the time when that was my job ; and when I saw the old sign , " Grimm 's Botanic Gardens and Nurseries "  --  I wanted to jump off the train and run through the grounds . It seemed as though every tulip called " hello " to me . CATHERINE Too bad you left college ! You had only one more year . HARTMAN Poor father ! He 's very much disappointed . Father has worked in the dirt in overalls  --  a gardener  --  all his life ; and , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent than most of our college professors . CATHERINE I understand why you came back . You simply must live where things grow , must n't you , James ? So must I. Have you seen our orchids ? p. 4 HARTMAN Orchids are pretty ; but they 're doing wonderful things with potatoes these days . I 'd rather improve the breed of a squash than to have an orchid named after me . Wonderful discovery of Luther Burbank 's  --  creating an edible cactus . Sometimes I feel bitter thinking what I might have done with vegetables , when I was wasting time studying Greek . CATHERINE Changing suddenly . James : why do n't you try to please Uncle Peter Grimm ? HARTMAN I do ; but he is always asking my opinion , and when I give it , he blows up . CATHERINE Coaxingly . Do n't be quite so blunt . Try to be like one of the family . HARTMAN I 'm afraid I shall never be like one of this family . CATHERINE Why not ? I 'm no relation at all ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do my best to agree with him . Offering his hand . It 's a promise . They shake hands . CATHERINE Thank you , James . HARTMAN Still holding her hand . It 's good to be back , Catherine . It 's good to see you again He is still holding her hand when FREDERIK GRIMM enters . He is the son of PETER 'S dead sister , and has been educated by PETER to carry on his work . He is a graduate of Amsterdam College , Holland , and , in appearance and manner , suggests the foreign student . He has managed to pull through college creditably , making a specialty of botany . PETER has given him the usual trip through Europe , and FREDERIK has come to his rich uncle to settle down and learn his business . He has been an inmate of the household for a few months . He poses as a most industrious young man , but is , at heart , a shirker. p. 5 FREDERIK Where 's Uncle ? HARTMAN Good-morning , Frederik . Your uncle 's watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after them again . FREDERIK I can hardly keep my eyes open . Uncle wakes me up every morning at five  --  creaking down the old stairs . Eyeing CATHERINE admiringly . You 're looking uncommonly pretty this morning , Kitty . CATHERINE edges away and runs upstairs to her room . FREDERIK Hartman ! HARTMAN Yes ? FREDERIK Miss Catherine and you and I are no longer children  --  our positions are altered  --  please remember that . I 'm no longer a student home for the holidays from Amsterdam College . I 'm here to learn the business which I am expected to carry on . Miss Catherine is a young lady now , and my uncle looks upon her as his daughter . You are here as my uncle 's secretary . That 's how we three stand in this house . Do n't call me " Frederik , " and hereafter be good enough to say , " Miss Grimm . " HARTMAN Amiably . Very well . FREDERIK James : there 's a good opportunity for a young man like you in our Florida house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 HARTMAN Why do you wish to ship me off to Florida ? FREDERIK I do n't understand you , Hartman . I do n't wish to ship you off . I am merely thinking of your future . You seem to have changed since  --  HARTMAN We 've all grown up , as you just said . JAMES has laid some mail on the desk , and is about to leave the room , when FREDERIK speaks again , but in a more friendly manner . FREDERIK The old man 's aging ; do you notice it ? HARTMAN Your uncle 's mellowing , yes ; but that 's only to be expected . He 's changing foliage with the years . FREDERIK He 's growing as old-fashioned as his hats . In my opinion , this would be the time to sell . HARTMAN Astonished . Sell ? Sell a business that has been in his family for  --  why , it 's his religion ! FREDERIK It 's at the height of its prosperity . It would sell like that ! Snapping his fingers . What was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rochester , Jim ? HARTMAN Noticing the sudden friendliness  --  looking at FREDERIK , half-amused , half-disgusted . Ca n't repeat correspondence , Mr. Grimm . Amazed . Good heavens ! You surprise me ! Would you sell your great , great grandfather ? I learned to read by studying his obituary out in the peach orchard : " Johann Grimm , of Holland , an upright settler . " There is n't a day your uncle does n't tell me that you are to carry on the work . p. 7 FREDERIK So I am , but it 's not my religion . Sarcastically . Every man ca n't be blessed like you with the soul of a market gardener  --  a peddler of turnips . HARTMAN Thinking  --  ignoring FREDERIK . He 's a great old man  --  your uncle . It 's a big name  --  Grimm  --  Peter Grimm . The old man knows his business  --  he certainly knows his business . Changing . God ! It 's an awful thought that a man must die and carry all that knowledge of orchids to the grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I must attend to the mail . PETER GRIMM enters from the gardens . He is a well-preserved man of sixty , very simple and plain in his ways . He has not changed his style of dress in the past thirty years . His clothing , collar , tie , hat and shoes are all old-fashioned . He is an estimable man , scrupulously honest , gentle and sympathetic ; but occasionally he shows a flash of Dutch stubbornness . FREDERIK I ran over from the office , Uncle Peter , to make a suggestion . GRIMM Yes ? FREDERIK I suggest that we insert a full-page cut of your new tulip in our mid-summer floral almanac . GRIMM Who has hung up his hat on his own particular peg , affably assenting . A good idea ! p. 8 FREDERIK The public is expecting it . GRIMM You think so , my boy ? FREDERIK Why , Uncle , you 've no idea of the stir this tulip has created . People stop me in the street to speak of it . GRIMM Well , well , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FREDERIK I 've had a busy morning , sir , in the packing house . GRIMM That 's good . I 'm glad to see you taking hold of things , Fritz . Humourously , touching FREDERIK affectionately on the shoulder . We must n't waste time ; for that 's the stuff life 's made of . Seriously . It 's a great comfort to me , Frederik , to know that when I 'm in my little private room with James , or when I 've slipped out to the hothouses ,  --  you are representing me in the offices  --  young Mr. Grimm . James , are you ready for me ? HARTMAN Yes , sir . GRIMM I 'll attend to the mail in a moment . Missing CATHERINE , he calls according to the household signal . Ou  --  oo ! He is answered by CATHERINE , who immediately appears from her room , and comes running downstairs . Catherine , I have news for you . I 've named the new rose after you : " Katie  --  a hardy bloomer . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 9 CATHERINE Thank you , Uncle Peter , thank you very much . And now you must have your cup of coffee . GRIMM What a fine little housewife ! A busy girl about the house , eh , Fritz ? Is there anything you need to-day , Katie ? CATHERINE No , Uncle Peter , I have everything I need , thank you . GRIMM Not everything ,  --  not everything , my dear . Smiling at FREDERICK . JAMES , ignored , is standing in the background . Wait ! Wait till I give you a husband . I have my plans . Looking from FREDERIK to CATHERINE . People do n't always know what I 'm doing , but I 'm a great man for planning . Come , Katie , tell me , on this fine spring morning , what sort of husband would you prefer ? CATHERINE Annoyed ,  --  with girlish impatience . You 're always speaking of weddings , Uncle Peter . I do n't know what 's come over you of late .

There , I must n't tease her . But I leave it to Fritz if I do n't owe her a fine husband  --  this girl of mine . Look what she has done for me ! p. 10 CATHERINE Done for you ? I do you the great favour to let you do everything for me . GRIMM Ah , but who lays out my linen ? Who puts flowers on my desk every day ? Who gets up at dawn to eat breakfast with me ? Who sees that I have my second cup of coffee ? But better than all that  --  who brings youth into my old house ? CATHERINE That 's not much  --  youth . GRIMM No ? We 'll leave it to Fritz . FREDERIK , amused , listens in silence . What should I be now  --  a rough old fellow  --  a bachelor  --  without youth in my house , eh ? God knows ! Katie has softened me towards all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my old pictures . Points to pictures . And I was growing hard  --  hard and fussy . CATHERINE Laughing . Ah , Uncle Peter , have I made you take a liking to all the rest of the ladies ? GRIMM Yes . It 's just as it is when you have a pet : you like all that breed . You can only see your kind of kitten . HARTMAN Coming down a step , impressed by PETER 'S remark  --  speaking earnestly . That 's so , sir . The others are surprised . I had n't thought of it in that way , but it 's true . You study a girl for the first time , and presently you notice the same little traits in every one of them . It makes you feel differently towards all the rest . p. 11 GRIMM Amused . Why , James , what do you know about girls ? " Bachelor " is stamped all over you  --  you 're positively labelled . HARTMAN Good-naturedly . Perhaps . Goes back to the office . GRIMM Poor James ! What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order a three-rib roast , who 's to eat it ? I never had a proper roast until Katie and Frederik came to make up my family ; Rubbing his hands. but the roasts are not big enough . Giving FREDERIK a knowing look . We must find a husband . CATHERINE You promised not to  --  GRIMM I want to see a long , long table with plenty of young people . CATHERINE I 'll leave the room , Uncle . GRIMM With myself at the head , carving , carving , carving , watching the plates come back , and back , and back . As she is about to go . There , there , not another word of this to-day . The ' phone rings . JAMES re-enters and answers it . HARTMAN Hello ! Turns . Rochester asks for Mr. Peter Grimm to the ' phone . Another message from Hicks ' greenhouses . p. 12 GRIMM Ask them to excuse me . HARTMAN Bluntly . You 'll have to excuse him . Listens . No , no , the gardens are not in the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Tc ! James ! Ca n't you say it politely ? JAMES listens at ' phone . FREDERIK Aside to PETER . James is so painfully blunt . Then changing . Is it  --  er  --  a good offer ? Is Hicks willing to make it worth while ? Catching his uncle 's astonished eye  --  apologetically . Of course , I know you would n't think of  --  CATHERINE I should say not ! My home ? An offer ? Our gardens ? I should say not ! FREDERIK Mere curiosity on my part , that 's all . GRIMM Of course , I understand . Sell out ? No indeed . We are thinking of the next generation . FREDERIK Certainly , sir . GRIMM We 're the last of the family . The business  --  that 's Peter Grimm . It will soon be Frederik Grimm . The love for the old gardens is in our blood . FREDERIK It is , sir . Lays a fond hand on PETER 'S shoulder . p. 13 GRIMM Struck . I have an idea . We 'll print the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a yawn . Yes , yes , a very good idea .

FREDERIK Very interesting , indeed . CATHERINE " To him Queen Anne furnished one square , one rule , one compass , two whipping saws and several small pieces . To him was born  --  " GRIMM Interrupting . You left out two augurs . CATHERINE Reads . Oh , yes  --  " and two augurs . To him was born a son  --  " GRIMM Who knows the history by heart , has listened , his eyes almost suffused  --  repeating each word to himself , as she reads .

GRIMM And now we are depending upon you , Frederik , for the next line in the book . To CATHERINE  --  slyly  --  as she closes the book . If my sister could see Frederik , what a proud mother she would be ! HARTMAN Turning from the ' phone to PETER . Old man Hicks himself has come to the ' phone . Says he must speak to Mr. Peter Grimm . FREDERIK I 'd make short work of him , Uncle . GRIMM At the ' phone . How are you , my old friend ? How are your plum trees ? Listens . Bad , eh ? Well , we can only pray and use Bordeaux Mixture . No Nonsense ! This business has been in my family for seven generations . Why sell ? I 'll see that it stays in the family seven generations longer ! Echoing . Do I propose to live that long ? N  --  no ; but my plans will . Looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good-morning . Hangs up the receiver . HARTMAN Sorry to disturb you , sir , but some of these letters are  --  FREDERIK I 'm off . p. 15 GRIMM Who has lifted a pot of tulips to set it in the sun  --  standing with the pot in his hands . And remember the saying : A twinkle in his upraised eyes . " Thou , O God , sellest all good things at the price of labour . " Smells the tulips and sets them down . FREDERIK Goes briskly towards the door . That 's true , sir . I want to speak to you later , Uncle  --  Turning , looking at JAMES. on a private matter . He goes off looking at his watch , as though he had a hard day 's work before him . GRIMM Looking after FREDERIK . Very capable young fellow , Frederik . I was a happy man , James , when I heard that he had won the prize for botany at Amsterdam College . I had to find out the little I know by experience . HARTMAN Impulsively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than  --  Catching a warning glance from CATHERINE , he pauses . GRIMM What ? HARTMAN Nothing , sir . I  --  CATHERINE Tugging at PETER 'S coat  --  speaking to him apart , as JAMES busies himself at the desk . Uncle Peter , I think you 're unfair to James . We used to have him to dinner very often before he went away . Now that he 's back , you treat him like a stranger . p. 16 GRIMM Surprised . Eh ? I did n't know that I  --  Petting CATHERINE . A good , unselfish girl . She thinks of everybody . Aloud . James , will you have dinner with us to-day ? HARTMAN Pleased and surprised . Thank you , sir  --  yes , sir . GRIMM It 's a roast goose  --  cooked sweet , James . Smacks his lips . Fresh green herbs in the dressing and a Figaro pudding . Marta brought over that pudding receipt from Holland . MARTA an old family servant , has entered with the air of having forgotten to wind the clock . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attends to the old clock , and passes off with CATHERINE . PETER sits at the desk , glancing over the mail . GRIMM Katie 's blossoming like a rose . Have you noticed how she 's coming out lately , James ? HARTMAN Yes , sir . GRIMM You 've noticed it , too ? Picks up another letter , looking over it . HARTMAN Yes , sir . GRIMM Pausing , taking off his eye-glasses and holding them on his thumb . Philosophically . How prettily Nature accomplishes her will  --  making a girl doubly beautiful that a young man may yield his freedom the more easily . Wonderful ! During the following , he glances over letters . A young girl is like a violet sheltered under a bush , James ; and that is as it should be , is n't it ? p. 17 HARTMAN No , sir , I do n't think so . GRIMM Surprised . What ? HARTMAN I believe people should think for themselves  --  not be GRIMM Go on . HARTMAN  --  er  --  GRIMM Well ? HARTMAN Remembering his promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HARTMAN I mean swallowed up . GRIMM Swallowed up ? Explain yourself , James . HARTMAN I should n't have mentioned it . GRIMM Certainly , certainly . Do n't be afraid to express an honest opinion . HARTMAN I only meant that you ca n't shape another 's life . We are all free beings and  --  GRIMM Free ? Of course Katie 's free  --  to a certain extent . Do you mean to tell me that any young girl should be freer ? Nonsense ! She should be happy that I am here to think for her  --  I ! We must think for people who ca n't think for themselves ; and a young girl ca n't . Signing an answer to a letter after hastily glancing over it . You have extraordinary ideas , James . p. 18 HARTMAN Excuse me , sir ; you asked my opinion . I only meant that we ca n't think for others  --  any more than we can eat or sleep for them . GRIMM As though accepting the explanation . Oh I see what you mean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its nature to lead its own life  --  that it may be a free being . Evidently I did n't make my meaning clear . Giving PETER another letter to sign . GRIMM Free ? Happy ? James , you talk like an anarchist ! You surprise me , sir . Where do you get these extraordinary ideas ? HARTMAN By reading modern books and magazines , sir , and of course  --  GRIMM I thought so . Pointing to his books . Read Heine . Cultivate sentiment . Signing the letter . Happy ? Has it ever occurred to you that Katie is not happy ? HARTMAN No , sir , I ca n't truthfully say that it has . GRIMM I imagine not . These are the happiest hours of her life . Young in love soon to be married . HARTMAN After a long pause . Is it settled , sir ? p. 19 GRIMM No , but I 'll soon settle it . Anyone can see how she feels towards Frederik . HARTMAN After a shorter pause . Is n't she very young to marry , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not when I am in the house  --  Touching his chest. to guard her  --  to watch over her . Leave it to me . Enthusiastically . Sit here , James . Take one of Frederik 's cigars . JAMES politely thanks him , but does n't take one . It 's a pleasure to talk to some one who 's interested ; and you are interested , James ? HARTMAN Yes , sir , I 'm much more interested than you might think . GRIMM Good . We 'll take up the mail in a minute . Now , in order to carry out my plans  --  CATHERINE Sticking her head in the door . Ready for coffee ? GRIMM Er  --  a little later . Close the door , dear . She disappears , closing the door . In order to carry out my plans , I have had to use great diplomacy . I made up my mind to keep Katie in the family ; being a rich man  --  everybody knows it  --  I 've had to guard against fortune-hunters . However , I think I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Katie has n't a penny  --  does n't it , James ? p. 20 HARTMAN Yes , sir . GRIMM Yes , I think I 've made that very clear . My dream was to bring Catherine up to keep her in the family , and it has been fulfilled . My plans have turned out beautifully , for she is satisfied and happy . HARTMAN But did you want her to be happy simply because you are happy , sir ? Do n't you want her to be happy because she is happy ? GRIMM If she 's happy , why should I care ? Picks up the last letter . HARTMAN If she 's happy . GRIMM Losing his temper . What do you mean ? That 's the second time you 've said that . Why do you harp on  --  HARTMAN Rising . Excuse me , sir . GRIMM Angrily . Sit down . What do you know ? HARTMAN Nothing , sir . GRIMM You must know something to speak in this manner . HARTMAN No , I do n't . You 're a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the greatest respect for your opinion ; but you ca n't mate people as you 'd graft tulips . And more than once , I 've  --  I 've caught her crying and I 've thought perhaps . . p. 21 GRIMM Pooh-poohing . Crying ? Of course ! Was there ever a girl who did n't cry ? You amuse me with your ideas of life . Ha ! Have n't I asked her why she was crying ,  --  and has n't she always said : " I do n't know why  --  it 's nothing . " They love to cry . Signs the last letter . But that 's what they all cry over  --  nothing . James , do you know how I happened to meet Katie ? She was prescribed for me by Doctor MacPherson . HARTMAN Taking the letter . Prescribed ? GRIMM As an antidote . I was growing to be a fussy bachelor , with queer notions . You are young , but see that you do n't need the Doctor , James . Do you know how I was cured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had business in the city , the Doctor went with me , and before I knew what he was at  --  he had marched me into a home for babies Katie was nearest the door  --  the first one . Pinned over her crib was her name : " Catherine Staats , aged three months . " She held out her little arms so friendless  --  so pitiful  --  so alone  --  and I was done for . We brought her back home , the Doctor , a nurse and I. The first time I carried her up those stairs  --  all my fine bachelor 's ideas went out of my head . I knew then that my theories were all humbug . I had missed the child in the house who was to teach me everything . I had missed many children in my house . From that day , I watched over her life .

HARTMAN To me , sir , it 's not a question of sentiment  --  of where her children shall play , so long as they play happily . GRIMM What ? Her children can play anywhere  --  in China if they want to ! Are you in your senses ? A fine reward for giving a child all your affection  --  to live to see her children playing in China . No , sir ! I propose to keep my household together , by your leave . Banging his clenched fist on the desk . It 's my plan . Cleans his pipe , looking at JAMES from time to time . JAMES posts the letters in a mail-box outside the door . PETER goes to the window , calling off . Otto !

Pats WILLIAM on the shoulder . p. 23 WILLIAM The Doctor says I 'm well now . GRIMM Good ! Then you shall take flowers to the church . Calls off . A big armful , Otto ! MARTA has entered with a neatly folded , clean handkerchief which she tucks into WILLIAM 'S breast pocket . GRIMM In a low voice , to JAMES . There 's your example of freedom !

HARTMAN Mr. Grimm , I  --  I wish you would transfer me to your branch house in Florida . GRIMM What ? You who were so glad to come back ! James , you need a holiday . Close your desk . Go out and busy yourself with those pet vegetables of yours . Change your ideas ; then come back sane and sensible , and attend to your work .

FREDERIK When I look back and remember him as a barefoot boy living in a shack behind our hot-houses  --  and see him now  --  in here with you  --  GRIMM All the more credit , Frederik . FREDERIK Yes ; but these are the sort of fellows who dream of getting into the firm . And there are more ways than one . GRIMM Do you mean to say  --  He would n't presume to think of such a thing . FREDERIK Oh , would n't he ! The class to which he belongs presumes to think of anything . I believe he has been making love to Catherine .

Tell me tell me GRIMM Has James ever  --  CATHERINE Taken back and rather frightened  --  quickly . No . GRIMM What ? How did you know what I FREDERIK gives her a shrewd glance ; but PETER , suspecting nothing , continues . I meant has James shown any special interest in you ? CATHERINE As though accepting the explanation . Oh Flurried . Why , Uncle Peter ! Uncle Peter ! whatever put this notion into your head ? GRIMM It 's all nonsense , of course , but  --  p. 26 CATHERINE I 've always known James . We went to school together .

Slaps FREDERIK on the back . You 're satisfied now , I hope ? FREDERIK No , I am not . If she has n't noticed what he has in mind , I have . When I came into this room a few moments ago ,  --  it was as plain as day . He 's trying to make love to her under our very eyes . I saw him . I wish you would ask him to stay in his office and attend to his own business . JAMES now re-enters on his way to the gardens . GRIMM James , it has just occurred to me  --  that  --  James pauses .

I never meant to say a word to her . I understand , sir . GRIMM James ! Come here here ! Bringing JAMES up before him at the desk . Get your money at the office . You may have that position in Florida . Good-bye , James . HARTMAN I 'm very sorry that Good-bye , sir . FREDERIK You are not to tell her that you 're going . You 're not to bid her good-bye .

Shakes hands with JAMES , who leaves the room too much overcome to speak . p. 28 MACPHERSON Who has entered , saying carelessly to JAMES as he passes him . Hy 're you , Jim ? Glad Jim 's back . One of the finest lads I ever brought into this world . The DOCTOR is a man of about PETER 'S age , but more powerfully built . He has the bent shoulders of the student and his face is exceedingly intellectual . He is the rare type of doctor who forgets to make out his bills . He has a grizzled grey beard , and his hair is touched with grey . He wears silver-rimmed spectacles . His substantial but unpressed clothing is made by the village tailor . GRIMM Good-morning , Andrew . FREDERIK Good-morning , Doctor . MACPHERSON Casts a quick , professional glance at PETER . Peter , I 've come over to have a serious word with you . Been on my mind all night . Brings down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Frederik FREDERIK , who is not a favourite of the DOCTOR 'S , takes the hint and leaves the room . Peter , have you provided for everybody in this house ? GRIMM What ? Have I  --  MACPHERSON You 're a terrible man for planning , Peter ; but what have you done ? Casually . Were you to die ,  --  say to-morrow ,  --  how would it be with  --  Making a gesture to include the household.  --  the rest of them ? p. 29 GRIMM What do you mean ? If I were to die to-morrow . . MACPHERSON You wo n't . Do n't worry . Good for a long time yet , but every one must come to it  --  sooner or later . I mean  --  what would Katie 's position be in this house ? I know you 've set your heart upon her marrying Frederik , and all that sort of nonsense , but will it work ? I 've always thought ' t was a pity Frederik was n't James and James was n't Frederik . GRIMM What ! MACPHERSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frederik , but supposing she does not . Peter , if you mean to do something for her  --  do it now . GRIMM Now ? You mean that I  --  You mean that I might die ? MACPHERSON All can and do . GRIMM Studying the DOCTOR 'S face . You think . . MACPHERSON The machinery is wearing out , Peter . Thought I should tell you . No cause for apprehension , but  --  GRIMM Then why tell me ? MACPHERSON When I cured you of that cold  --  wet flowerbeds  --  two days ago , I made a discovery . Seeing CATHERINE enter , he pauses . She is followed by MARTA , carrying a tray containing coffee and a plate of waffles . Coffee ! I told you not to touch coffee , Peter . It 's rank poison . p. 30 CATHERINE Would n't you like a cup , Doctor ? GRIMM Yes he 'll take a cup . He wo n't prescribe it , but he 'll drink it . MACPHERSON Horrified . And hot waffles between meals ! GRIMM Yes , he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another plate and more waffles , and CATHERINE follows her . Now , Andrew , you ca n't tell me that I 'm sick . I wo n't have it . Every day we hear of some old boy one hundred years of age who was given up by the doctors at twenty . No , sir ! I 'm going to live to see children in my house ,  --  Katie 's babies creeping on my old floor ; playing with my old watch-dog , Toby . I 've promised myself a long line of rosy Grimms . MACPHERSON My God , Peter ! That dog is fifteen years old now . Do you expect nothing to change in your house ? Man , you 're a home worshipper . However , I  --  I see no reason why  --  Lying. you should n't reach a ripe old age . Markedly , though feigning to treat the subject lightly . Er  --  Peter , I should like to make a compact with you that whoever does go first  --  and you 're quite likely to outlive me ,  --  is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settle the question . Splendid test between old neighbours  --  real contribution to science . p. 31 GRIMM Make a compact to  --  stuff and nonsense ! MACPHERSON Do n't be too sure of that . GRIMM No , Andrew , no , positively , no . I refuse . Do n't count upon me for any assistance in your spook tests . MACPHERSON And how many times do you think you 've been a spook yourself ? You ca n't tell me that man is perfect ; that he does n't live more than one life ; that the sould does n't go on and on . Pshaw ! The persistent personal energy must continue , or what is God ? CATHERINE has re-entered with another cup , saucer and plate which she sets on the table , and pours out the coffee . CATHERINE Interested . Were you speaking of  --  of ghosts , Doctor ? GRIMM Yes , he has begun again . To CATHERINE . You 're just in time to hear it . To DR . MACPHERSON . Andrew , I 'll stay behind , contented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , and you shall die and return with your  --  ha !  --  persistent personal whatever-it-is , and keep the spook compact . Every time a knock sounds , or a chair squeaks , or the door bangs , I shall say , " Sh ! There 's the Doctor ! " CATHERINE Noticing a book which the DOCTOR has taken from his pocket , and reading the title . " Are the Dead Alive ? " p. 32 MACPHERSON I 'm in earnest , Peter . I 'll promise and I want you to promise , too . Understand that I am not a so-called spiritist . I am merely a seeker after truth . Puts more sugar in his coffee . GRIMM That 's what they all are  --  seekers after truth . Rubbish ! Do you really believe such stuff ? MACPHERSON I know that the dead are alive . They 're here  --  here  --  near us  --  close at hand . PETER , in derision , lifts the table-cloth and peeps under the table  --  then , taking the lid off the sugar-bowl , peers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day are of the same opinion . GRIMM Bah ! Dreamers ! They accomplish nothing in the world . They waste their lives dreaming of the world to come . MACPHERSON You ca n't call Sir Charles Crookes , the inventor of Crookes Tubes ,  --  a waster ? Nor Sir Oliver Lodge , the great biologist ; nor Curie , the discoverer of radium ; nor Doctor Lombroso , the founder of Science of Criminology ; nor Doctors Maxwell , deVesm , Richet , Professor James , of Harvard , and our own Professor Hyslop . Instead of laughing at ghosts , the scientific men of to-day are trying to lay hold of them . The frauds and cheats are being crowded from the field . Science is only just peeping through the half-opened door which was shut until a few years ago . p. 33 GRIMM If ever I see a ghost , I shall lay violent hands upon it and take it to the police station . That 's the proper place for frauds . MACPHERSON I 'm sorry , Peter , very sorry , to see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most important thing in life . Hyslop is right : man will spend millions to discover the North Pole , but not a penny to discover his immortal destiny . GRIMM Stubbornly . I do n't believe in spook mediums and never shall believe in them . MACPHERSON Probably most professional mediums cheat  --  perhaps every one of them ; but some of them are capable of real demonstrations at times . GRIMM Once a swindler , always a swindler . Besides , why ca n't my old friends come straight back to me and say , " Peter Grimm , here I am ! " When they do  --  if they do  --  I shall be the first man to take off my hat to them and hold out my hand in welcome . MACPHERSON You ask me why ? Why ca n't a telegram travel on a fence instead of on a wire ? Your friends could come back to you if you could put yourself in a receptive condition ; but if you can not , you must depend upon a medium  --  a sensitive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eh ? He has all the names for them . Yesterday it was " apports "  --  flowers that fell down from nowhere and hit you on the nose . He talks like a medium 's parrot . He has only to close his eyes and along comes the parade . Spooks ! Spooky spooks ! And now he wants me to settle my worldly affairs and join in the procession . p. 34 CATHERINE Puzzled . Settle your worldly affairs ? What do you mean , Uncle Peter ? GRIMM Evasively . Just some more of his nonsense . Doctor , you 've seen a good many cross to the other world ; tell me  --  did you ever see one of them come back  --  one ? MACPHERSON No . GRIMM Sipping his coffee . Never have , eh ? And never will . Take another cup of poison , Andrew . The DOCTOR gives his cup to CATHERINE , who fills it . PETER passes the waffles to the DOCTOR , at the same time winking at CATHERINE as the DOCTOR takes another . MACPHERSON There was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them back . But in my own family , I have known of a case . GRIMM A part to CATHERINE . He 's off again . CATHERINE Eager to listen . Please do n't interrupt , Uncle . I love to hear him tell of  --  MACPHERSON I have known of a return such as you mention . A distant cousin died in London and she was seen almost instantly in New York . p. 35 GRIMM She must have travelled on a biplane , Andrew . MACPHERSON If my voice can be heard from San Francisco over the telephone , why can not a soul with a God-given force behind it dart over the entire universe ? Is Thomas Edison greater than God ? CATHERINE Shocked . Doctor ! MACPHERSON And they ca n't tuck it all on telepathy . Telepathy can not explain the case of a spirit-message giving the contents of a sealed letter known only to the person that died . Here 's another interesting case . GRIMM This is better than " Puss in Boots , " is n't it , Katie ? More  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CATHERINE Listening eagerly . Uncle , please . MACPHERSON Ignoring PETER , speaking directly to CATHERINE , who is all attention . An officer on the Polar vessel , the Jeannette , sent to the Artic regions by the New York Herald , appeared at his wife 's bedside . She was in Brooklyn  --  he was on the Polar sea . He said to her , " Count . " She distinctly heard a ship 's bell and the word " Count " again . She had counted six when her husband 's voice said , " Six bells  --  and the Jeanette is lost . " The ship was really lost at the time she saw the vision . p. 36 GRIMM A bad dream . " Six bells and the "  --  Ha ! Ha ! Spirit messages ! Suet pudding has brought me messages from the North Pole , and I receive messages from Kingdom Come after I 've eaten a piece of mince pie . MACPHERSON There have been seventeen thousand other cases found to be worth investigation by the London Society of Psychical Research . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cross over "  --  I believe that 's what you call dying ,  --  that I did want to come back to see how you and the little Katie and Frederik were getting on , how do you think I could manage to do it ? MACPHERSON When we hypnotize subjects , Peter , our thoughts take possession of them . As we enter their bodies , we take the place of a something that leaves them  --  a shadow-self . This self can be sent out of the room  --  even to a long distance . This self leaves us entirely after death on the first , second or third day , or so I believe . This is the force which you would employ to come back to earth  --  the astral envelope . GRIMM Yes , but what proof have you , Doctor , that I 've got an  --  an astral envelope . MACPHERSON Easily . De Rochas has actually photographed it by radio-photography. p. 37 GRIMM Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! Ho ! Ho ! MACPHERSON Mind you  --  they could n't see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See it ? Ho ! Ho ! MACPHERSON It stood a few feet away from the sleeper , and was located by striking at the air and watching for the corresponding portion of the sleeper 's body to recoil . By pricking a certain part of this shadow-self with a pin , the cheek of the patient could be made to bleed . The camera was focussed on this part of the shadow-self for fifteen minutes . The result was the profile of a head . GRIMM After a pause . You believe that ? MACPHERSON The experiment has been repeated again and again . Nobody acquainted with the subject denies it now . GRIMM Spook pictures taken by professional mediums ! Turning away from the table as though he had heard enough . MACPHERSON De Rochas , who took the pictures of which I speak , is a lawyer of standing ; and the room was full of scientists who saw the pictures taken . GRIMM Hypnotized  --  all of them . Humbug , Andrew ! MACPHERSON Under these conditions , it is quite impossible to hypnotize a room full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? In similar circumstances , says Lombroso , an unnatural current of cold air went through the room and lowered the thermometer several degrees . Can you hypnotize a thermometer ? p. 38 CATHERINE Impressed . That 's wonderful , Doctor ! GRIMM Yes , it 's a very pretty fairy story ; but it would sound better set to shivery music . Sings . Tol ! Dol ! Dol ! Dol ! Rising to get his pipe and tobacco . No , sir ! I refuse to agree to your compact . You can not pick the lock of heaven 's gate . We do n't come back . God did enough for us when he gave us life and strength to work and the work to do . He owes us no explanations . I believe in the old-fashioned paradise with a locked gate . He fills his pipe and lights it . No bogies for me . MACPHERSON Rising . Peter , I console myself with the thought that men have scoffed at the laws of gravitation , at vaccination , magnetism , daguerreotypes , steamboats , cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Showing feeling . I 'm very much disappointed that you refuse my request . GRIMM Laying down his pipe on the table . Since you take it so seriously  --  here  --  Offers his hand . I 'll agree . I know you 're an old fool  --  and I 'm another . Now then  --  Shakes hands. it 's settled . Whichever one shall go first  --  He bursts into laughter  --  then controlling himself . If I do come back , I 'll apologize , Andrew . p. 39 MACPHERSON Do you mean it ? GRIMM I 'll apologize . Wait Taking the keys from the sideboard. , let us seal the compact in a glass of my famous plum brandy . MACPHERSON Good ! GRIMM As he passes off . We 'll drink to spooks . CATHERINE You really do believe , Doctor , that the dead can come back , do n't you ? MACPHERSON Of course I do , and why not ? CATHERINE Do you believe that you could come back here into this room and I could see you ? MACPHERSON You might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . CATHERINE Could you talk to me ? MACPHERSON Yes . CATHERINE And could I hear you ? MACPHERSON I believe so . That 's what we 're trying to make possible . CATHERINE , still wondering , passes off with the tray . From the cellar , PETER can be heard singing lustily . GRIMM " If you want a bite that 's good to eat , ( Tra , la , ritte , ra , la , la , la ! ) Try out a goose that 's fat and sweet , ( Tra , la , ritte , ra , la , la , la ! " ) During the song , MRS . BATHOLOMMEY has given a quick tap on the door and entered . She is about forty years of age . Her faded brown hair is streaked with grey . She wears a plain black alpaca costume . p. 40 MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Agitated . Good-morning , Doctor . Fortunate that I found you alone . MACPHERSON Dryly . Hy 're you , Mrs. Batholommey ? The REV . HENRY BATHOLOMMEY now enters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frock coat , high waistcoat and square topped hat of a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church . BATHOLOMMEY Hy 're , Henry ? The REV . MR . BATHOLOMMEY bows . WILLIAM has returned from his errand and entered the room ,  --  a picture-book under his arm . He sits up by the window , absorbed in the pictures  --  unnoticed by the others . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Closing the door left open by PETER , shutting out the sound of his voice . Well , Doctor She pauses for a moment to catch her breath and wipe her eyes . I suppose you 've told him he 's got to die . MACPHERSON Eyeing MRS . BATHOLOMMEY with disfavour . Who 's got to die ? MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Why , Mr. Grimm , of course . MACPHERSON Amazed . Does the whole damned town know it ? p. 41 MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Oh ! BATHOLOMMEY Easy , Doctor . You consulted Mr. Grimm 's lawyer and his wife told my wife . MACPHERSON He gabbed , eh ? Hang the professional man who tells things to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I greatly grieve to hear that Mr. Grimm has an incurable maladv . His heart , I understand . Shakes his head . MACPHERSON He 's not to be told . Is that clear ? He may die in twenty minutes  --  may outlive us all  --  probably will . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Pointing to REV . MR . BATHOLOMMEY . It seems to me , Doctor , that if you ca n't do any more , it 's his turn . It 's a wonder you Doctors do n't baptize the babies . BATHOLOMMEY Rose ! MRS . BATHOLOMMEY At the last minute , he 'll want to make a will  --  and you know he has n't made one . He 'll want to remember the church and his charities and his friends ; and if he dies before he can carry out his intentions , the minister will be blamed as usual . It 's not fair . BATHOLOMMEY Sh ! Sh ! My dear ! These private matters  --  p. 42 MACPHERSON I 'll trouble you , Mistress Batholommey , to attend to your own affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who flattened her nose  --  sticking it into other people 's business ? BATHOLOMMEY Doctor ! Doctor ! I ca n't have that ! MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Let him talk , Henry . No one in this town pays any attention to Dr. MacPherson since he took up with spiritualism . BATHOLOMMEY Rose ! He motions to her to be silent , as PETER , coming up the stairs from the cellar , is heard singing . GRIMM " Drop in the fat some apples red , ( Tra , la , ritte , ra , la , la , la ! ) Then spread it on a piece of bread , ( Tra , la , ritte , ra , la , la , la ! ) " He opens the door , carrying a big bottle in his hand ; hailing the BATHOLOMMEYS cheerfully . Good-morning , good people . He puts the jug on the sideboard and hangs up the key . The BATHOLOMMEYS look sadly at PETER . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY in the foreground tries to smile pleasantly , but can only assume the peculiarly pained expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rising to the occasion  --  warmly grasping PETER 'S hand . Ah , my dear friend ! Many thanks for the flowers William brought us , and the noble cheque you sent me . We 're still enjoying the vegetables you generously provided . I did relish the squash . p. 43 GRIMM Catching a glimpse of MRS . BATHOLOMMEY 'S gloomy expression . Anything distressing you this morning , Mrs. Batholommey ? MRS . BATHOLOMMEY No , no . I hope you 're feeling well  --  er  --  I do n't mean that  --  I  --  BATHOLOMMEY Cheerily . Of course , she does ; and why not , why not , dear friend ? GRIMM Will you have a glass of my plum brandy ? MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Stiffly . No , thank you . As you know , I belong to the W. C. T. U. GRIMM Pastor ? BATHOLOMMEY Tolerantly . No , thank you . I am also oposed to er  --  GRIMM We 're going to drink to spooks  --  the Doctor and I. MRS . BATHOLOMMEY With a startled cry . Oh ! Lifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And at a time like this . The very idea  --  you of all people ! GRIMM Coming down with two glasses  --  handing one to the DOCTOR . You seem greatly upset , Mrs. Batholommey . Something must have happened . p. 44 BATHOLOMMEY Nothing , nothing , I assure you . My wife is a trifle nervous to-day . We must all keep up our spirits , Mr. Grimm . GRIMM Of course . Why not ? Looking at MRS . BATHOLOMMEY  --  struck . I know why you 're crying . You 've been to a church wedding . To the DOCTOR , lifting his glass . To astral envelopes , Andrew . They drink . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY With sad resignation . You were always kind to us , dear Mr. Grimm . There never was a kinder , better . sweeter man than you were . GRIMM Than I was ? BATHOLOMMEY Rose , my dear ! MRS . BATHOLOMMEY What will become of William ? Weeps . GRIMM William ? Why should you worry over William ? I am looking after him . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone too far . I only meant  --  it 's too bad he had such an M  --  GRIMM An M  --  ? MRS . BATHOLOMMEY In pantomime  --  mouthing the word so that WILLIAM can not hear . Mother Annamarie. p. 45 GRIMM Oh ! MRS .

S-c-o-u-n-d-r-e-l  --  whoever he is ! Calls . William . WILLIAM looks up from his book . You 're very contented here with me , are you not ? WILLIAM Yes , sir . GRIMM And you want to stay here ? WILLIAM Yes , sir . At that moment , a country circus band  --  playing a typical parade march  --  blares out as it comes up some distant street . There 's a circus in town . GRIMM A circus ? WILLIAM Yes , sir . The parade has started . Opens the window and looks out towards left . Here it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? WILLIAM Pointing . There ! p. 46 GRIMM As delighted as WILLIAM . You 're right . It 's coming this way ! Here come the chariots . Gestures to the BATHOLOMMEYS to join him at the window . The music comes nearer and nearer  --  the parade is supposed to be passing . WILLIAM gives a cry of delight as a clown appears at the window with handbills under his arm . THE CLOWN As he throws the handbills into the room . Billy Miller 's big show and monster circus is in town this afternoon . Only one ring . No confusion . Seeing WILLIAM . Circus day comes but once a year , little sir . Come early and see the wild animals and hear the lions roar-r-r ! Mind ! Holding up his finger to WILLIAM . I shall expect to see you . Wonderful troupe of trained mice in the side show . Sings .

GRIMM Putting his hand in his pocket . We 'll go . You may buy the tickets , William  --  two front seats . FREDERIK re-enters with a floral catalogue . p. 47 MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Apart to REV . MR . BATHOLOMMEY  --  looking at PETER . Somebody ought to tell him . WILLIAM Getting the money from PETER . I 'm going ! I 'm going ! Dances . Oh , Mr. Grimm , there ai n't anyone else like you in the world . When the other boys laugh at your funny old hat , I never do . Pointing to PETER 'S hat on the peg . GRIMM My hat ? They laugh at my hat ? WILLIAM We 'll have such a good time at the circus . It 's too bad you 've got to die , Mr. Grimm . There is a pause . PETER stops short , looking at WILLIAM . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect of WILLIAM 'S revelation . FREDERIK does n't know what to make of it . There is an ominous silence in the room . Then MRS . BATHOLOMMEY , whose smile has been frozen on her face , takes WILLIAM 'S hand and is about to draw him away , when PETER lays his hand on WILLIAM 'S shoulder . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY steps back . GRIMM Kindly . Yes , William , most people have to . What made you think of it just then ? p. 48 WILLIAM Points to the DOCTOR . He said so . Perhaps in twenty minutes . BATHOLOMMEY Quietly but very sternly . William ! WILLIAM now understands that he should not have repeated what he heard . GRIMM Do n't frighten the boy . Only children tell the truth . Tell me , William  --  you heard the Doctor say that ? WILLIAM is silent . He keeps his eyes on the CLERGYMAN who is looking at him warningly . The tears run down his cheeks  --  he puts his fingers to his lips  --  afraid to speak . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILLIAM His voice trembling . Y  --  es , sir . GRIMM Looks round the room  --  beginning to understand . What did you mean , Andrew ? MACPHERSON I 'll tell you , Peter , when we 're alone . GRIMM But MRS . BATHOLOMMEY shakes her finger threateningly at WILLIAM who whimpers . Never mind . It popped out , did n't it , William ? Get the circus tickets and we 'll have a fine time just the same . WILLIAM goes for the tickets . p. 49 BATHOLOMMEY I  --  er  --  good-morning , dear friend . Takes PETER 'S hand . Any time you ' phone for me  --  day or night  --  I 'll run over instantly . God bless you , sir . I 've never come to you for any worthy charity and been turned away  --  never . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Suddenly overcome . Good-bye , Mr. Grimm . In tears , she follows her husband . The DOCTOR and PETER look at each other . MACPHERSON Cigar in mouth  --  very abruptly . It 's cardiac valvular  --  a little valve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder . There 's my ' phone . As a bell is heard faintly but persistently ringing across the street . I 'll be back . Catches up his hat to hasten off . GRIMM Just a minute . MACPHERSON Turning . Do n't fret yourself , Peter . You 're not to imagine you 're worse than you are . Angrily . Do n't funk ! GRIMM Calmly . That was n't my reason for detaining you , Andrew . With a twinkle in his eye . I merely wanted to say  --  p. 50 MACPHERSON Yes ? GRIMM That if there is anything in that ghost business of yours , I wo n't forget to come back and apologize for my want of faith . The DOCTOR goes home . FREDERIK stands looking at his UNCLE . There is a long pause . PETER throws up both hands . Rubbish ! Doctors are very often wrong . It 's all guess work , eh , Fritz ? FREDERIK Thinking of his future in case of PETER 'S death . Yes , sir . GRIMM However , to be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plum brandy . Then thinking aloud . Not yet Not yet I 'm not ready to die yet . I have so much to live for . When I 'm older When I 'm a little old leaf ready to curl up , eh , Fritz ? He drains the glass . Goes up to the peg , takes down his hat , looks at it as though remembering WILLIAM 'S words , then puts it back on the peg . He shows no sign of taking DR . MACPHERSON 'S verdict to heart  --  in fact , he does n't believe it . Frederik , get me some small change for the circus  --  enough for William and me . FREDERIK Are you going after all ? And with that child ? GRIMM Why not ? p. 51 FREDERIK Suddenly showing feeling . That little tattler ? A child that listens to everything and just told you He should n't be allowed in this part of the house . He should be sent away . GRIMM Astonished . Why do you dislike him , Frederik ? He 's fine little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and goes to the piano , running her hands softly over the keys  --  playing no melody in particular . PETER sits in his big chair at the table and picks up his pipe . FREDERIK , with an inscrutable face , now strikes a match and holds it to his uncle 's pipe . PETER thoughtfully takes one or two puffs ; then speaking so as not to be heard by CATHERINE . Frederik , I want to think that after I 'm gone , everything will be the same here just as it is now . FREDERIK Yes , sir . Sitting near PETER . GRIMM Just as it is FREDERIK nods assent . PETER smokes . The room is very cheerful . The bright midday sunshine creeps through the windows ,  --  almost causing a haze in the room  --  and resting on the pots and vases and bright flowers on the tables . CATHERINE Singing .

CATHERINE " The bee must gather its store ; The cat must watch the mouse-hole ; The dog must guard the door . " GRIMM As though he had a weight off his mind . We wo n't speak of this again . It 's understood . Smokes , listening with pleasure as CATHERINE finishes the song . CATHERINE Repeats the chorus . " The cat must watch the mouse-hole ; The dog must guard the door.La la , La la , " &amp;c . At the close of the song , PETER puts down his pipe and beckons to CATHERINE . p. 53 GRIMM Give me the Book . CATHERINE brings the Bible to PETER as the garden bell rings outside . FREDERIK Noon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  points to the closely written page . Under my name I want to see this written : " Married : Catherine and Frederik .

Will you ? CATHERINE I I do n't know . GRIMM Taking the rose and her hand in his own . I know for you , my dear . Make me happy . CATHERINE There 's nothing I would n't do to make you happy , Uncle , but  --  FREDERIK You know that I love you , Kitty . GRIMM Yes , yes , yes . That 's all understood . He has always loved you . Everybody knows it . CATHERINE Uncle GRIMM Make it a June wedding . We have ten days yet .

He goes quickly to PETER and listens to his heart . CATHERINE and FREDERIK on either side of him . The DOCTOR with tender sympathy takes CATHERINE in his arms . WILLIAM Rushes in with two tickets in his hand , leaving the door open . The circus music is faintly heard . Mr. Grimm ! MACPHERSON Sh ! A pause as though breaking the news to them all . He 's gone . FREDERIK Questioningly  --  dazed . Dead ? CATHERINE is overcome . WILLIAM At PETER 'S side  --  holding up the circus ticket. @x SCENE .

His pipes and jar of tobacco are missing . A number of wedding presents are set on a table , some unopened . The interior of the room , with its snapping fire , forms a pleasant contrast to the gloomy exterior . The day is fading into dusk . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY is at the piano , playing the wedding march from " Lohengrin . " Four little girls are grouped about her , singing the words to the air . " Faithful and true:We lead ye forth , Where love triumphantShall lighten the way . " " Bright star of love , Flower of the earth , Shine on ye bothOn Love 's perfect day . " MRS . BATHOLOMMEY That 's better . Children , remember that this is to be a very quiet wedding . You 're to be here at noon to-morrow . You 're not to speak as you enter the room and take your places near the piano . Miss Staats will come down from her room ,  --  at least I suppose she will  --  and will stand Thinks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop when I look at you . Watch me as though I were about to be married . She takes her place at the foot of the stairs and the children repeat the song until she has marched across the room and stationed herself in some appropriate corner . As FREDERIK appears from the hall , where he leaves his raincoat and umbrella , MRS . BATHOLOMMEY motions the children to silence . That will do , dears , thank you . Hurry home between showers . The children go as she explains to FREDERIK . My Sunday-school scholars I thought your dear uncle would like a song at the wedding . I know how bright and cheery he would have been  --  poor man . Dear , noble , charitable soul ! p. 57 FREDERIK In a low voice . Where 's Catherine ? MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Taking up her fancy work , seating herself . Upstairs . FREDERIK With that sick child ? Tc ! MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Catherine finds it a pleasure to sit beside the little fellow . William is very much better . FREDERIK Taking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be off to Europe . I 've just had a telegram to say a cabin has been reserved for me on the Imperator . To-morrow , thank God , we shall take the afternoon train to New York . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY I must confess that I 'm very glad . Of course , I 'm happy to stay and chaperone Catherine ; but poor Mr. batholommey has been alone at the parsonage for ten days ever since your dear uncle Pauses , unwinding yarn , then unburdening her mind . I did n't think at first that Catherine could persuade herself to marry you . FREDERIK Sharply . I do n't understand you , Mrs. Batholommey . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY I mean she seemed so averse to  --  to an immediate marriage ; but of course it was your uncle 's last request , and that influenced her more than anything else . So it 's to be a June wedding , after all ; he has his wish . You 'll be married in ten days from the time he left us . Remembering . Some more letters marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put them in the drawer  --  Points to desk. with the rest . It seems odd to think the postman brings your uncle 's letters regularly , yet he is not here . p. 58 FREDERIK Looking towards the door of the office . Did Hartman come ? MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Yes . He seemed rather surprised that you 'd sent for him . FREDERIK Did you  --  er  --  tell him that we intend to leave to-morrow ? MRS . BATHOLOMMEY I spoke of your wedding trip ,  --  yes . FREDERIK Did he seem inclined to stay ? MRS . BATHOLOMMEY He did n't say . He seemed very much agitated . MARTA enters , carrying a night lamp . We 'll pack Miss Catherine 's things to-night , Marta . She notices the lamp . The night lamp for William ? Looks up towards the door of his room . Go in very quietly . He 's asleep , I think . MARTA goes up the stairs and into WILLIAM 'S room . By the way , Mr. Batholommey was very much excited when he heard that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're anxious to hear it read . FREDERIK , paying no attention to her words , is glancing at the wedding presents . We 're anxious to hear it read . HARTMAN Entering . Did you wish to see me ? p. 59 FREDERIK Offering his hand to JAMES . How do you do , Hartman ? I 'm very glad you consented to come back . My uncle never went into his office again after you left . There is some private correspondence concerning matters of which I know nothing ; it lies on your old desk . I 'm anxious to settle everything to-night . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY leaves the room . HARTMAN Very well . I have no doubt but that I can get through with it by midnight . FREDERIK If you care to remain longer with the firm , I  --  er  --  HARTMAN No , thank you . FREDERIK I appreciate the fact that you came on my uncle 's account . I have no ill-feeling against you , Hartman . HARTMAN I 'm not refusing to stay because of any ill-feeling . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your uncle 's cold in his grave . I do n't care to stay to see the old place change hands . FREDERIK I ? Sell out ? My intention is to carry out every wish of my dear old uncle 's . HARTMAN I hope so . I have n't forgotten that you wanted him to sell out to Hicks of Rochester on the very day he died . Exit into the office . &gt;CATHERINE comes from WILLIAM 'S room , simply dressed in white  --  no touch of mourning . FREDERIK goes to the foot of the stairs and calls softly . p. 60 FREDERIK Kitty ! Here is our marriage license . I have the cabin on the Imperator . Everything is arranged . CATHERINE Coming downstairs . Yes . I meant to speak to you  --  again . FREDERIK To-morrow 's the day , dear . CATHERINE Very subdued . Yes . FREDERIK A June wedding  --  just as Uncle Peter wished . CATHERINE As before . Yes Just as he wished . Everything is just as he . With a change of manner  --  earnestly  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go away . I do n't want to go to Europe . If only I could stay quietly here in  --  Tears in her voice as she looks round the room.  --  in my dear home . FREDERIK Why do you want to stay in this old cottage  --  with its candles and lamps and shadows ? It 's very gloomy , very depressing . CATHERINE I do n't want to leave this house . I do n't want any home but this . Panic-stricken . Do n't take me away , Frederik . I know you 've never really liked it at Grimm 's Manor . Are you sure you 'll want to come back to live here ? p. 61 FREDERIK As though speaking to a child . Of course . I 'll do anything you ask . CATHERINE I  --  I 've always wanted to please After a slight pause , finding it difficult to speak his name . Uncle Peter . I felt that I owed everything to him . If he had lived if I could see his happiness at our marriage  --  it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm afraid we 're making a mistake . I do n't feel towards you as I ought , Frederik . I 've told you again and again ; but I want to tell you once more : I 'm willing to marry you but I do n't love you  --  I never shall . FREDERIK How do you know ? CATHERINE I know I know . It seems so disloyal to speak like this after I promised him ; but  --  FREDERIK Yes , you did promise Uncle Peter you 'd marry me , did n't you ? CATHERINE Yes . FREDERIK And he died believing you ? CATHERINE Yes . FREDERIK Then it all comes to this : are you going to live up to your promise ? p. 62 CATHERINE That 's it . That 's what makes me try to live up to it . Wiping her eyes . But you know how I feel . You understand . FREDERIK Perfectly ; you do n't quite know your own mind . Very few young girls do , I suppose . I love you and in time you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILLIAM 'S room and closing the door comes down the stairs and passes off . What are we to do with that child ? CATHERINE He 's to stay here , of course . FREDERIK The child should be sent to some institution . What claim has he on you  --  on any of us ? CATHERINE Why do you dislike him ? FREDERIK I do n't , but  --  CATHERINE Yes , you do . I ca n't understand it . I remember how angry you were when you came back from college and found him living here . You never mention his mother 's name , yet you played together as children . When Uncle tried to find Annamarie and bring her back , you were the only one opposed to it . FREDERIK William is an uncomfortable child to have in the house . He has a way of staring at people as though he had a perpetual question on his lips . It 's most annoying . p. 63 CATHERINE What question ? FREDERIK As for his mother  --  I 've never seen her since she left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name on your lips . Her reputation is  --  The rain starts pattering on the shingled roof . To ! More rain the third day of it . Going to the window  --  calling . Otto ! Angrily . Otto ! See what the wind has done  --  those trellises . Bangs the window shut . That old gardener should have been laid off years ago . By the way , his son James is here for a few hours  --  to straighten matters out . I must see how he 's getting on . Taking her hand , drawing her towards the table with a change of manner . Have you seen all the wedding presents , Kitty ? I 'll be back in a few minutes . Pats her cheek and exits . CATHERINE stands over her wedding presents just as he left her  --  not looking at them  --  her eyes filled with tears . The door is suddenly opened and the DOCTOR enters , a tweed shawl over his shoulders , wearing a tweed cap . He has a book under his arm . MACPHERSON How 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sees through her . He tosses his cap , coat and book on the sofa . What 's the matter ? p. 64 CATHERINE Nothing . I was only thinking . I was hoping that those we love and lose ca n't see us here . I 'm beginning to believe there 's not much happiness in this world . MACPHERSON Why , you little snip . I 've a notion to spank you . Talking like that with life before you ! Read this book , child ; Gesturing towards the book on the sofa. it proves that the dead do see us ; they do come back . Walks to the foot of the stairs  --  turns . Catherine , I understand that you 've not a penny to your name  --  unless you marry Frederik ; that he has inherited you along with the orchids and tulips . Do n't let that influence you .

Goes half-way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neighbours ' opinions and a few silver spoons  --  Pointing to the wedding presents. stand in the way of your future . Exit into WILLIAM 'S room . The rain increases . The sky grows blacker  --  the room darker . CATHERINE gives a cry and stretches out her arms , not looking up . CATHERINE Uncle Peter ! Uncle Peter ! Why did you do it ? Why did you ask it ? Oh , dear ! Oh , dear ! If you could see me now . She stands rigid  --  her arms outstretched . MARTA , who has silently entered from the dining-room with fresh candles , goes to CATHERINE . CATHERINE suddenly buries her face on MARTA 'S broad breast , breaking into sobs ; then recovering , wipes her eyes . There , there I must n't cry others have troubles , too , have n't they ? p. 65 MARTA Others have troubles , too . CATHERINE I had hoped , Marta , that Annamarie would have heard of Uncle 's loss and come back to us at this time . MARTA If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no message nothing . . I can not understand . CATHERINE She knows that our door is open . The rain beats against the windows . A sharp double knock is heard at the door . CATHERINE starts as though suddenly brought to herself , hastily goes into the next room , taking the DOCTOR 'S book with her . MARTA has hurried towards the front door , when the REV . MR . BATHOLOMMEY and COLONEL LAWTON appear in the hall as though they had entered quickly , to escape the storm . MARTA greeting them , passes off to tell FREDERIK of their presence . The REV . MR . BATHOLOMMEY wears a long , black cloth , rain-proof coat . COLONEL LAWTON wears a rubber poncho . COLONEL LAWTON is a tall man with a thin brown beard and moustache , about forty-eight . He is dressed in a Prince Albert coat , unpressed trousers , and a neglige shirt . He wears spectacles and has a way of throwing back his head and peering at people before answering them . The REV . MR . BATHOLOMMEY sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad-brimmed hat on the handle  --  as though to let it drip . p. 66 BATHOLOMMEY Brr ! I believe it 's raining icicles . LAWTON Taking off his overshoes . Gee Whillikins ! What a day ! Good thing the old windmill out yonder is tied up . Great weather for baptisms , Parson . There is a faint , far-away rumble of thunder . FREDERIK enters . Well , here we are , Frederik , my boy  --  at the time you mentioned . BATHOLOMMEY How are you , Frederik ? COLONEL LAWTON crosses to the fire , followed by the REV . MR . BATHOLOMMEY . FREDERIK Who has gone to the desk for a paper lying under a paper-weight . I sent for you to hear a memorandum left by my uncle . I only came across it yesterday . There is a louder peal of thunder . A flash of lightning illuminates the room . LAWTON I must have drawn up ten wills for the old gentleman , but he always tore'em up . May I have a drink of his plum brandy , Frederik ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  COLONEL LAWTON goes to the sideboard and pours out two drinks from a decanter . A heavy roll of thunder now ends in a sharp thunderclap . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY , who is entering the room , gives a cry and puts her hands over her face . COLONEL LAWTON bolts his whiskey . The REV . MR . BATHOLOMMEY takes a glass and stands with it in his hand . p. 67 MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Removing her hands in time to see the brandy . Why , Henry ! What are you doing ? Are your feet wet ? BATHOLOMMEY No , Rose ; they 're not . I want a drink and I 'm going to take it . It 's a bad night . Drinks . LAWTON Throws a hickory log on the fire , which presently blazes up , making the room much lighter . Go ahead , Frederik . Sits . BATHOLOMMEY has drawn up a chair for his wife , and now seats himself before the snapping hickory fire . BATHOLOMMEY I knew that your uncle would remember his friends and his charities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was the very soul of generosity . He gave in such a free-handed , princely fashion . FREDERIK Reading in a businesslike manner . For Mrs. Batholommey  --  MRS . BATHOLOMMEY The dear man  --  to think that he remembered me ! I knew he 'd remember the church and Mr. Batholommey , of course ; but to think that he 'd remember me ! He knew that my income was very limited . He was so thoughtful ! His purse was always open . FREDERIK Eyes MRS . BATHOLOMMEY for a second , then continues . For Mr. Batholommey  --  REV . MR . BATHOLOMMEY nods solemnly. and the Colonel . p. 68 LAWTON Taking out a cigar . He knew that I did the best I could for him His voice breaks. the grand old man . Recovering . What 'd he leave me ? Mrs. B.  --  er ? Nods inquiringly at MRS . BATHOLOMMEY , who bows assent , and he lights his cigar . FREDERIK Glancing at the paper . Mrs. Batholommey , he wished you to have his miniature  --  with his affectionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ er  --  yes ? FREDERIK To Mr. Batholommey  --  MRS . BATHOLOMMEY But  --  er  --  you did n't finish with me . FREDERIK You 're finished . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY I 'm finished ? FREDERIK You may read it yourself if you like . BATHOLOMMEY No , no , no . She 'll take your word for it . Firmly . Rose ! FREDERIK Reads . " To Mr. Batholommey , my antique watch-fob  --  with my profound respects . " Continues . To Colonel Lawton  --  p. 69 MRS . BATHOLOMMEY His watch fob ? Is that what he left to Henry ? Is that all ? As FREDERIK nods . Well ! If he had no wish to make your life easier , Henry , he should at least have left something for the church . Oh ! Wo n't the congregation have a crow to pick with you ! FREDERIK Reading . " To my life-long friend , Colonel Lawton , I leave my most cherished possession . " COLONEL LAWTON has a look on his face as though he were saying , " Ah ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angrily . When the church members hear that  --  LAWTON Chewing his cigar . I do n't know why he was called upon to leave anything to the church  --  he gave it thousands ; and only last month , he put in chimes . As I look at it , he wished to give you something he had used  --  something personal . Perhaps the miniature and the fob ai n't worth three whoops in Hell ,  --  it 's the sentiment of the thing that counts  --  Chewing the word with his cigar the sentiment . Drive on , Fred . FREDERIK " To Colonel Lawton , my father 's prayer-book . " LAWTON Suddenly changing  --  dazed . His prayer-book me ? p. 70 MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Seeing FREDERIK lay down the paper and rise . Is that all ? FREDERIK That 's all . LAWTON Still dazed . A prayer-book . Me ? Well , I 'll be  --  Struck . Here , Parson , let 's swap . You take the prayer-book  --  I 'll take the old fob . BATHOLOMMEY Stiffly . Thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looks out  --  his back turned to the others  --  trying to control his feelings . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Her voice trembling with vexation and disappointment . Well , all that I can say is  --  I 'm disappointed in your uncle . LAWTON Is it for this you hauled us out in the rain , Frederik ? MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Bitterly . I see now he only gave to the church to show off . BATHOLOMMEY Rose ! I myself am disappointed , but  --  MRS . BATHOLOMMEY He did ! Or why did n't he continue his work ? He was not a generous man . He was a hard , uncharitable , selfish old man . p. 71 BATHOLOMMEY Horrified . Rose , my dear ! MRS . BATHOLOMMEY He was ! If he were here , I 'd say it to his face . The congregation sicked you after him . Now that he 's gone and you 'll get nothing more , they 'll call you slow  --  slow and pokey . You 'll see ! You 'll see to-morrow . BATHOLOMMEY Sh !

One of these new football playing ministers , just out of college , will take your place . It 's not what you preach now that counts ; it 's what you coax out of the rich parishioners ' pockets . BATHOLOMMEY In a low voice . Mrs. Batholommey ! MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Religion does n't stand where it did , Henry  --  there 's no denying that . There was a time when people had to go to church  --  they were n't decent if they did n't . Now you have to wheedle ' em in . The church needs funds in these days when a college professor is openly saying that  --  Her voice breaks. the Star of Bethlehem was a comet . Weeps . p. 72 BATHOLOMMEY Control yourself . I must insist upon it , Mrs. Batholommey . MRS .

I 've virtually given up my business for him , and what have I got out of it ? Not a button ! Not a button ! A bible . Still I 'm not complaining . Hang that chimney , Frederik , it 's smoking . COLONEL LAWTON stirs the fire  --  a log falls out and the flame goes down . The room has gradually grown darker as the night approaches MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Turning on COLONEL LAWTON . Oh , you 've feathered your nest , Colonel ! You 're a rich man . LAWTON Enraged , raising his voice . What ? I never came here that you were n't begging . FREDERIK Virtuously  --  laying down the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much more I should have if he had n't continually doled out money to every one of you ! p. 73 LAWTON What ? FREDERIK He was putty in your hands . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Yes , you can afford to defend his memory  --  you 've got the money . FREDERIK I do n't defend his memory . He was a gullible old fossil , and the whole town knew it . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY You did at any rate . I 've heard you flatter him by the hour . FREDERIK Of course . He liked flattery and I gave him what he wanted . Why not ? I gave him plenty . The rest of you were at the same thing ; and I had the pleasure of watching him give you the money that belonged to me  --  to me  --  my money What business had he to be generous with my money ? The COLONEL strikes a match to light his cigar , and , as it flares up , the face of FREDERIK is seen  --  distorted with anger . I 'll tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been nothing left for me . It 's a fortunate thing for me that  --  He pauses , knowing that he has said too much . The room is now very dark . The rain has subsided . Everything is quiet outside . There is not a sound , save the ticking of the clock . BATHOLOMMEY Solemnly  --  breaking the pause . Young man , it might have been better had Mr. Grimm given his all to charity  --  for he has left his money to an ingrate. p. 74 FREDERIK Laughing derisively . Ha ! Ha ! MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Sh ! Someone 's coming . All is quiet . The clock ticks in the dark . The door opens . FREDERIK With a change of voice . Come in . Nobody enters . Where 's a light ? We 've been sitting in the dark like owls . Come in . A pause . He strikes a match and holds it above his head . The light shows the open door . A wind , blowing through the door-way , causes the match to flicker , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see who 's Looks out . No one . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Someone must be there . Who opened the door ? The wind puts out the match in FREDERIK 'S hand . The room is once more in semi-darkness . There it closed again FREDERIK strikes another match and holds it up . The door is seen to be closed . LAWTON Who is nearest to the door . I did n't touch it . FREDERIK Blowing out the match . I 'll have the lamps brought in. p. 75 MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Curious BATHOLOMMEY It was the wind  --  a draught . LAWTON Returning to his chair . Must have been . CATHERINE Entering with a lamp . Did someone call me ? Without pausing , she sets the lamp on the table down right  --  opposite the group of characters . She turns up the wick and PETER GRIMM is seen standing in the room  --  half in shadow . He is as he was in life . The clothes he wears appear to be those he wore about his house in the first act . He carries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind smile , the same deferential manner , but his face is more spiritual and years younger . The lamp , which CATHERINE has placed on the table , brightens the room . GRIMM Whose eyes never leave CATHERINE.Yes I called you I 've come back . FREDERIK To CATHERINE . No . GRIMM Do n't be frightened , Katie . It 's the most natural thing in the world . You wanted me and I came . FREDERIK Why ? What made you think someone called you ? CATHERINE I 'm so accustomed to hear Uncle Peter 's voice in this room , that sometimes I forget he 's not here I ca n't get over it ! I was almost sure I heard him speak but , of course , as soon as I came in  --  I remembered . But some one must have called me. p. 76 FREDERIK No . PETER stands looking at them , perplexed ; not being able to comprehend as yet that he is not seen . CATHERINE Is n't it curious to hear your name and turn and Unconsciously , she looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nerves Imagination . FREDERIK You need a complete change . Crossing to the door . For heaven 's sake , let 's have more light or we shall all be hearing voices . GRIMM Strange . Nobody seems to see me . It 's  --  it 's extraordinary ! Katie ! Katie ! His eyes have followed CATHERINE who is now at the door . CATHERINE Pausing . Perhaps it was the book I was reading that made me think I heard The Doctor lent it to me . FREDERIK Pooh-poohing . Oh ! CATHERINE Half to herself . If he does know , if he can see , he 'll be comforted by the thought that I 'm going to do everything he wanted . She passes out of the room . p. 77 GRIMM Showing that he does not want her to carry out his wishes . No , no , do n't Frederik , I want to speak to you . FREDERIK , not glancing in PETER 'S direction , lights a cigarette . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Well , Frederik , I hope the old gentleman can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistakes . REV . MR . BATHOLOMMEY rises and goes towards the door , pausing in front of PETER to take out his watch . Mr. Batholommey , I 'm glad to see you in my house I 'm very sorry that you ca n't see me . I was n't pleased with my funeral sermon ; it was very gloomy  --  very . I never was so depressed in my life . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY To FREDERIK . Do you know what I should like to say to your uncle ? GRIMM I know . BATHOLOMMEY I hope at least you 'll care for the parish poor as your uncle did  --  and keep on with some of his charities . GRIMM Putting his hand on REV . MR . BATHOLOMMEY 'S shoulder . That 's all attended to . I arranged all that with Frederik . He must look after my charities . p. 78 FREDERIK I might as well tell you now  --  you need n't look to me . It 's Uncle Peter 's fault if your charities are cut off . BATHOLOMMEY Half-doubtingly . It does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his good works . FREDERIK remains stolid . REV . MR . BATHOLOMMEY puts back his watch after glancing at it . Just thirty minutes to make a call . Goes into the hall to put on his overshoes , coat , &amp;c. , leaving PETER 'S hand extended in the air . LAWTON Rising . I must be toddling . Pauses . It 's queer , Frederik , how things turn out in this world . He stands , thinking matters over  --  cigar in mouth , his hand on his chin . GRIMM Slipping his hand through COLONEL LAWTON 'S arm . They seem to look each other in the eye . You were perfectly right about it , Thomas , I should have made a will I  --  suppose it is a little too late , is n't it ? It would be  --  er  --  unusual to do it now , would n't it ? COLONEL LAWTON , who has heard nothing  --  seen nothing  --  moves away as though PETER had never held his arm , and goes up into the hall for his cape and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall . Oh , er  --  what are you going to do with all the old man 's family relics , Frederik ? FREDERIK The junk , you mean ? I shall lay it on some scrapheap , I suppose . It 's not worth a penny . LAWTON I 'm not so sure of that . They say there 's a lot of money paid for this sort of trash . FREDERIK Is that so ? Not a bad idea to have a dealer in to look it over . PETER stands listening , a faint smile on his face . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY If I could have the old clock  --  cheap , Frederik , I 'd take it off your hands . FREDERIK I 'll find out how much it 's worth . I shall have everything appraised . Sets his watch by the clock . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY gives him a look and joins her husband at the door . LAWTON Good-night . Exit , closing the door . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY As REV . MR . BATHOLOMMEY goes out  --  calling after him . Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . BATHOLOMMEY leaves the room too disgusted for words . FREDERIK goes into the office . p. 80 GRIMM Now alone . We live and learn and oh ! what I have learned since I came back . He goes to his own particular peg in the vestibule and hangs up his hat . He glances at the wedding presents . Presently he sees the flowers which CATHERINE has placed on the desk . With a smile , he touches the flowers . MARTA enters with another lamp , which she places on a table . As PETER 'S eyes rest on MARTA , he nods and smiles in recognition , waiting for a response . Well , Marta ? Do n't you know your old master ? No ? No ? She winds the clock and leaves the room . I seem to be a stranger in my own house yet the watch-dog knew me and wagged his tail as I came in . He stands trying to comprehend it all . Well ! Well !

Well of course in that case I might be tempted . To-morrow ? No , I ca n't see you to-morrow . I 'm going to be married to-morrow , and leave at once for New York . Thank you . Listens . To-night ? Very well , but I do n't want it known . I 'll sell , but it must be for more than the price my uncle refused . Make it ten thousand more and it 's done . Listens . You 'll come to-night ?

What would he say if he knew ? What could he say ? Everything must change . A far-away rumble of thunder is heard  --  the lightning flickers at the window and a flash is seen on the telephone which tinkles and responds as though from the electric shock . Exclaiming " Ugh , " FREDERIK drops the receiver  --  which hangs down . GRIMM The storm passes as he speaks into the receiver without touching the telephone . Good-evening , my friend . We shall soon meet  --  face to face . You wo n't be able to carry this matter through . Looking into space as though he could see the future . You 're not well and you 're going out to supper to-night ; you will eat something that will cause you to pass over . I shall see you to-morrow . A happy crossing ! FREDERIK Picks up the receiver . Hello ? You do n't feel well , you say ? Then echoing the purport of HICKS ' answer . I see . Your lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's entirely a question of money , Mr. Hicks . Send your lawyer to the Grimm Manor Hotel . I 'll arrange at once for a room . Good-bye . Hangs up the receiver . That 's off my mind . He lights a fresh cigarette  --  his face expressing the satisfaction he feels in the prospect of a perfectly idle future . PETER looks at him as though to say : " And that 's the boy whom I loved and trusted ! " FREDERIK gets his hat , throws his coat over his arm , and hastens out . p. 82 GRIMM Turns and faces the door leading into the next room , as though he could feel the presence of some one waiting there . Yes . . I am still in the house . Come in come in He repeats the signal of the first act . Ou  --  oo . The door opens slowly  --  and CATHERINE enters as though at PETER 'S call . She looks about her , not understanding . He holds out his arms to her . CATHERINE walks slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she does not respond . She does not know that she is being held . There ! There ! Do n't worry . It 's all right . We 'll arrange things very differently . I 've come back to change all my plans . She moves away a step  --  just out of his embrace . He tries to call her back . Katie ! Ca n't I make my presence known to you ? Katie ! Ca n't my love for you outlive me ? Is n't it here in the home ? Do n't cry . She moves about the room in thought . As PETER watches her  --  she pauses near his desk . CATHERINE Suddenly . Crying does n't help matters . GRIMM She hears me . She does n't know it , but she hears me . She 's cheering up . She inhales the flowers  --  a half smile on her lips . That 's right , you have n't smiled before since I died . Suddenly giving way to the realization of her loss , CATHERINE sighs . p. 83 GRIMM Correcting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was a happier place than the world I left . I 'm a trifle confused . I 've not had time to adjust myself to these new conditions . CATHERINE smiles sadly  --  goes up to the window , and , leaning against the pane , looks out into the night . PETER continues comfortingly . The dead have never really died , you know . We could n't die if we tried . We 're all about you . Look at the gardens : they 've died , have n't they ? But there they are all the better for it . Death is the greatest thing in the world . It 's really a  --  Ha !  --  delightful experience . What is it , after all ? A nap from which we waken rested , refreshened a sleep from which we spring up like children tumbling out of bed  --  ready to frolic through another world . I was an old man a few days ago ; now I 'm a boy . I feel much younger than you  --  much younger . A conflict is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chair by the fireplace and sits  --  her back to the audience . He approaches her and lays a tender hand on her shoulder . I know what you 're thinking . Katie , I want you to break that very foolish promise I asked you to make . You 're almost tempted to . Break it ! Break it at once ; then  --  Glancing smilingly towards the door through which he came  --  as though he wished to leave  --  like a child longing to go back to play. then I could  --  take the journey back in peace . I ca n't go until you do  --  and I I long to go Is n't my message any clearer to you ? Reading her mind . You have a feeling an impression of what I 'm saying ; but the words the words are not clear Mm let me see If you ca n't understand me  --  there 's the Doctor , he 'll know how to get the message  --  he 'll find the way . Then I can hurry back home p. 84 CATHERINE Helplessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm so alone . GRIMM Cheerily . Not alone at all  --  not at all . I shall drop in very often and then , there 's your mother . Suddenly remembering . Oh , yes , I had almost forgotten . I have a message for you , Katie . He seats himself in a chair which is almost in front of her . I 've met your mother . She sits in a reverie . PETER continues with the air of a returned traveller relating his experiences . She heard that I had crossed over and there she was  --  waiting for me . You 're thinking of it , are n't you ? Wondering if we met . Yes , that was the first interesting experience . She knew me at once . " You were Peter Grimm , " she said , " before you knew better "  --  that 's what they call leaving this world  --  " to know better . " You call it " dying . " Confidentially . She 's been here often , it seems , watching over you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that you had a happy home . I spoke of your future  --  of my plans for you and Frederik . " Peter Grimm , " she said , " you 've over-looked the most important thing in the world  --  love . You have n't given her her right to the choice of her lover  --  her right ! " Then it came over me that I 'd made a terrible mistake and at that minute , you called to me . Impressively . In the darkness surrounding all I had left behind , there came a light a glimmer where you stood a clear call in the night . It seemed as though I had not been away one second but in that second , you had suffered . Now I am back to show you the way . I am here to put my hand on your dear head and give you your mother 's blessing ; to say she will be with you in spirit until she holds you in her arms  --  you and your loved husband  --  CATHERINE turns in her chair and looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working . PETER catches the thought.  --  yes , James , it 's you And the message ended in this kiss . Prints a kiss on her cheek . Ca n't you think I 'm with you , dear child ? Ca n't you think I 'm trying to help you ? Ca n't you even hope ? Oh , come , at least hope ! Anybody can hope . CATHERINE rises with an entire change of manner  --  takes a bright red blossom from the vase on PETER 'S desk  --  then deliberately walks to the door of the room in which JAMES is working . PETER follows her action hopefully . She does not tap on the door , however , but turns and sits at the piano  --  in thought  --  not facing the piano . She puts PETER 'S flowers against her face . Then , laying the flowers on the piano , sings softly three or four bars of the song she sang in the first act  --  and stops abruptly . p. 85 CATHERINE To herself . That I should sit here singing  --  at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why not ? Lift up your voice like a bird ! Your old uncle does n't sleep out there in the dust . That 's only the dream . He 's here  --  here  --  alive . All his age gone and youth glowing in his heart . If I could only tell you what lies before you  --  before us all ! If people even suspected what the next life really is , they would n't waste time here  --  I can tell you that . They 'd do dreadful things to get away from this existence  --  make for the nearest pond or  --  Pausing abruptly . Ah , here comes someone who 'll know all about it ! The DOCTOR comes from WILLIAM 'S room . PETER greets him in a cordial but casual way , as though he had parted from him only an hour before . Well , Andrew , I apologize . Bowing obsequiously . You were right . I apologize . CATHERINE How is he , Doctor ? MACPHERSON William is better . Dropped off to sleep again . Ca n't quite understand him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could come back , I would ; and here I am  --  apologizing . Andrew ! Andrew ! Trying to attract DR . MACPHERSON 'S attention . I have a message , but I ca n't get it across . This is your chance . I want you to take it . I do n't wish Catherine to marry Frederik. p. 86 MACPHERSON He 's somewhat feverish yet . GRIMM Ca n't you understand one word ? MACPHERSON It 's a puzzling case . GRIMM What ? Mine ? MACPHERSON Getting a pad from his pocket  --  writing out a prescription with his fountain pen . I 'll leave this prescription at the druggist 's  --  GRIMM I 'm quite shut out . They 've closed the door and turned the key on me . MACPHERSON Suddenly noticing that CATHERINE seems more cheerful . What 's happened ? I left you in tears and here you are  --  all smiles . CATHERINE Yes , I  --  I am happier  --  for some reason For the last few minutes I  --  I 've had such a strange feeling . MACPHERSON That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hungry mouse . Something seemed to draw me down here  --  ca n't explain it . GRIMM I 'm beginning to be felt in this house . MACPHERSON Catherine , I have the firm conviction that , in a very short time , I shall hear from Peter . Sitting at the table . p. 87 GRIMM I hope so . It 's high time now . MACPHERSON What I want is some positive proof ; some absolute test ; some  --  er  --  Thinks . CATHERINE has seated herself at the table .  --  Unconsciously they both occupy the same seats as in the first act . GRIMM The trouble is with other people , not with us . You want us to give all sorts of proofs ; and here we are just back for a little while  --  very poorly put together on the chance that you 'll see us at all . MACPHERSON Poor old Peter  --  bless his heart ! His elbow on the table as though he had been thinking over the matter . CATHERINE sits quietly listening . If he kept that compact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what I 'd ask him first ? If our work goes on . GRIMM Well , now , that 's a regular sticker . It 's bothered me considerably since I crossed over . CATHERINE What do you mean , Doctor ? MACPHERSON The question every man wants the answer to : what 's to become of me  --  me  --  my work ? Am I going to be a bone setter in the next life and he a tulip man ? I wonder . GRIMM Andrew , I 've asked everybody  --  Tom , Dick and Harry . One spirit told me that sometimes our work does go on ; but he was an awful liar  --  you know we do n't drop our earth habits at once . He said that a genius is simply a fellow who 's been there before in some other world and knows his business . Now then : Confidentially preparing to open an argument  --  sitting in his old seat at the table , as in the first act. it stands to reason , Andrew , does n't it ? What chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business before he was born ? p. 88 MACPHERSON Unconsciously grasping the thought . I believe it is possible to have more than one chance at our work . GRIMM There you caught that . Why ca n't you take my message to Catherine ? MACPHERSON Rising to get his shawl  --  gruffly . Thought over what I told you concerning this marriage ? Not too late to back out . GRIMM He 's beginning to take the message . CATHERINE Everything 's arranged : I shall be married as Uncle Peter wished . I sha' n't change my mind . MACPHERSON H 'm ! Picks up his shawl . GRIMM Trying to detain the DOCTOR  --  tugging at his shawl without seeming to pull it . Do n't give up ! Do n't give up ! A girl can always change her mind  --  while there 's life . Do n't give up ! The DOCTOR turns , facing PETER , looking directly at him as he puts his hand in his coat pocket . You heard that , eh ? Did n't you ? Yes ? Did it cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in the face , Andrew ; can you see me ? The DOCTOR takes a pencil out of his pocket , writes a prescription , throws his shawl over his shoulder  --  turning his back towards PETER and facing CATHERINE . Tc ! Tc ! Tc ! p. 89 MACPHERSON Good-night . CATHERINE Good-night . CATHERINE goes quietly to the fireplace , kneeling down , mends the fire , and remains there sitting on an ottoman . GRIMM Calling after the DOCTOR . If I could only make some sign  --  to start you thinking ; but I ca n't depend upon you , I see that . Then changing  --  as though he had an idea . Ah , yes ! There is another way . Now to work . With renewed activity , he taps in the direction of the office door , although he himself stands three feet away from it . The door opens promptly and JAMES appears on the threshold  --  pen in hand  --  as though something had made him rise suddenly from his desk . CATHERINE , still seated , does not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is to be married on the following day . PETER tempts JAMES . Yes , she is pretty , James young and lovely . Look ! There are kisses tangled in her hair where it curls hundreds of them . Are you going to let her go ? Her lips are red with the red of youth . Every smile is an invocation to life . Who could resist her smiles ? Can you , James ? No , you will not let her go . And her hands , James . Look ! Hands made to clasp and cling to yours . Imagine her little feet trudging happily about your home Look at her shoulders shaped for a resting-place for a little head . Youwere right , James , we should ask nothing of our girls but to marry the men they love and be happy wives and happy mothers of happy children . You feel what I am saying . You could n't live without her , could you ? No ? Very well , then  --  Changing abruptly . Now , it 's your turn . JAMES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes forward a step and CATHERINE , hearing him , turns and rises . p. 90 HARTMAN Coldly  --  respectfully . Miss Grimm CATHERINE James HARTMAN I felt that you were here and wished to speak to me . I  --  I do n't know why GRIMM Good for James . CATHERINE Shaking hands with him . I 'm very glad to see you again , James . When PETER sees that he has brought the two young people together , he stands in the background . The lovers are in the shadow , but PETER 'S figure is marked and clear . Why did you go away ? HARTMAN Oh  --  er  --  CATHERINE And without saying a word . HARTMAN Your uncle sent me away . I told him the truth again . CATHERINE Oh HARTMAN I am going in a few hours . CATHERINE Where are you going ? What do you intend to do ? HARTMAN Half-heartedly . Father and I are going to try our luck together . We 're going to start with a small fruit farm . It will give me a change to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I come back home Uncle gone and you , James . Her voice trembling . HARTMAN I hope you 'll be happy , Catherine . CATHERINE James , Uncle died smiling at me  --  thinking of me and just before he went , he gave me his mother 's wedding ring and asked me to marry Frederik . I shall never forget how happy he was when I promised . That was all he wanted . His last smile was for me and there he sat  --  still smiling after he was gone the smile of a man leaving the world perfectly satisfied  --  at peace . It 's like a hand on my heart  --  hurting it  --  when I question anything he wanted . I could n't meet him in the hereafter if I did n't do everything he wished ; I could n't say my prayers at night ; I could n't speak his name in them . He trusted me ; depended upon me ; did everything for me ; so I must do this for him . I wanted you to know this , James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth ? CATHERINE I have . HARTMAN That you do n't love him ? CATHERINE does n't answer , but JAMES knows . And he 's willing to take you like that ?  --  a little girl like you  --  in that way . God ! He 's rotten all the way through . He 's even worse than I thought . Katie , I did n't mean to say a word of this to-day  --  not a word ; but a moment since  --  something made me change my mind  --  I do n't know what ! PETER smiles . I felt that I must talk to you . You looked so young , so helpless , such a child . You 've never had to think for yourself  --  you do n't know what you 're doing . You could n't live under it , Catherine . You 're making the greatest mistake possible , if you marry where you do n't love . Why should you carry out your uncle 's plans ? You 're going to be wretched for life to please a dead man who does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , regrets it bitterly . p. 92 GRIMM I agree with you now , James . CATHERINE You mus n't say that , James . HARTMAN But I will say it  --  I will speak my mind . I do n't care how fond you were of your uncle or how much he did for you  --  it was n't right to ask this of you . It was n't fair . The whole thing is the mistake of a very obstinate old man . CATHERINE James ! HARTMAN I loved him , too ; but he was an obstinate old man . Sometimes I think it was the Dutch blood in his veins . GRIMM A very frank , outspoken fellow . I like to hear him talk  --  now . HARTMAN Do you know why I was sent away ? Why I quarrelled with your uncle ? I said that I loved you he asked me . I did n't tell him because I had any hopes  --  I had n't . I have n't now . Struck . But in spite of what I 'm saying I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could take you in my arms and you would let me but I do think it . CATHERINE Retreats , backing towards PETER . No ! Do n't touch me , James  --  you must n't ! Do n't ! Do n't ! PETER pushes her into JAMES ' arms , without touching her . She exclaims " Oh , James ! " and fairly runs towards JAMES as though violently propelled . In reality , she thinks that she is yielding to an impulse . As she reaches him , she exclaims " No , " and turns back , but JAMES , with outstretched arms , catches her . p. 93 HARTMAN You love me . Draws her to him . CATHERINE Do n't make me say that , James . HARTMAN I will make you say it ! You do love me . CATHERINE No matter if I do , that wo n't alter matters . HARTMAN What ? What ? CATHERINE No , no , do n't say any more . I wo n't hear it . She stands free of JAMES  --  then turns and walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean it ? Are you really going to sacrifice yourself because of  --  Am I really losing you ? Catherine ! Catherine ! CATHERINE In tears  --  beseechingly . Please do n't Please do n't . FREDERIK enters . Until the entrance of FREDERIK , PETER has had hope in his face , but now he begins to feel apprehensive . FREDERIK Throwing his hat and coat on a chair . I have some work to do  --  more of my uncle 's unopened mail ; then I 'll join you , Hartman . We must  --  er  --  make haste . JAMES looks at CATHERINE , then at FREDERIK . CATHERINE gives him an imploring glance  --  urging him not to speak . FREDERIK has gone to PETER 'S desk . p. 94 HARTMAN I 'll come back later . Goes towards the hall . FREDERIK Catherine , have you asked James to be present at the ceremony to-morrow ? CATHERINE No . FREDERIK James , will you  --  HARTMAN I shall be leaving early in the morning . FREDERIK Too bad ! Exit JAMES . FREDERIK lights the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  opens two letters  --  tears them up after barely glancing at them  --  then sees CATHERINE still standing at the foot of the stairs  --  her back to him . He lays the cigar on the desk , crosses , and , taking her in his arms , kisses her . CATHERINE With a revulsion of feeling . No ! No ! No ! She covers her face with her hands  --  trying to control herself . Please ! Not now . FREDERIK Why not now ? Suspiciously . Has Hartman been talking to you ? What has he been saying to you ? CATHERINE starts slowly up the stairs . Wait a moment , please . As she retreats a step up the stairs , he follows her . Do you really imagine you  --  you care for that fellow ? p. 95 CATHERINE Do n't  --  please . FREDERIK I 'm sorry to insist . Of course , I knew there was a sort of school-girl attachment on your part ; that you 'd known each other since childhood . I do n't take it at all seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must insist , however , that you do not speak to him again to-night . After to-morrow  --  after we are married  --  I 'm quite sure that you will not forget you are my wife , Catherine  --  my wife . CATHERINE I sha' n't forget . She escapes into her room . FREDERIK goes to his desk . GRIMM Confronting FREDERIK . Now , sir , I have something to say to you , Frederik Grimm , my beloved nephew ! I had to die to find you out ; but I know you ! FREDERIK is reading a letter . You sit there opening a dead man 's mail  --  with the heart of a stone  --  thinking : " He 's gone ! he 's gone !  --  so I 'll break every promise ! " But there is something you have forgotten  --  something that always finds us out : the law of reward and punishment . Even now it is overtaking you . Your hour has struck . FREDERIK takes up another letter and begins to read it ; then , as though disturbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As though perplexed by the condition of his own mind , he ponders , his eyes resting unconsciously on PETER . Your hour has struck . p. 96 FREDERIK To himself . What in the world is the matter with me to-night ? GRIMM Read ! FREDERIK Has opened a long , narrow , blue envelope containing a letter on blue paper and a small photograph . He stares at the letter , aghast . My God ! Here 's luck . Here 's luck ! From that girl Annamarie to my uncle . Oh , if he had read it ! GRIMM Standing in front of FREDERIK looks into space  --  as though reading the letter in the air . " Dear Mr. Grimm : I have not written because I ca n't do anything to help William , and I am ashamed . " FREDERIK Wh ! As though he had read the first part to himself , now reads aloud . " Do n't be too hard upon me . I have gone hungry trying to save a few pennies for him , but I never could ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have him back . William is far better off with you . I  --  " Hesitates . GRIMM Going back of the desk , standing behind FREDERIK 'S chair . Go on . FREDERIK " I wish that I might see him once again . Perhaps I could come and go in the night . " p. 97 GRIMM That 's a terrible thing for a mother to write . FREDERIK Who has been looking down at the letter  --  suddenly feeling PETER 'S presence . Who 's that ? Who 's in this room ? Looks over his shoulder  --  then glances about . I could have sworn somebody was looking over my shoulder or had come in at the door or But seeing no one  --  he continues . " I met someone from home ; if there is any truth in the rumour of Catherine 's marriage  --  it must n't be , Mr. Grimm  --  it must n't be not to Frederik . For Frederik is my little boy 's  --  " FREDERIK gives a furtive glance upstairs at the door of the child 's room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her picture Turns it over  --  looks at the back  --  reads . " For my boy , from Annamarie . " FREDERIK , conscious-stricken for the time being , bows his head . GRIMM For the first time since I entered this house , you are yourself , Frederik Grimm . Once more a spark of manhood is alight in your soul . Courage ! It 's not too late to repent . Turn back , lad ! Follow your impulse . Take the little boy in your arms . Go down on your knees and ask his mother 's pardon . Turn over a fresh page , that I may leave this house in peace . p. 98 FREDERIK Looks about uneasily , then glances towards the door leading into the hall . Who is at the door ? Curious I thought I heard someone at GRIMM I am at the door  --  I , Peter Grimm ! Annamarie is at the door  --  the little girl who is ashamed to come home ; the old mother in the kitchen breaking her heart for some word . William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  nameless ; Katie , sobbing her heart out  --  you can hear her ; all  --  we are all at the door  --  every soul in this house . We are all at the door of your conscience , Frederik . Do n't keep us waiting , my boy . It 's very hard to kill the love I had for you . I long to love you again  --  to take you back to my heart  --  lies and all . FREDERIK rises  --  in deep thought . Yes ! Call her ! Tell her the truth . Give her back her promise . Give her back her home . Close the door on a peaceful , happy , silent room and go . Think  --  think of that moment when you give her back her freedom ! Think of her joy , her gratitude , her affection . It 's worth living for , lad . Speak ! Make haste and call her , Fritz . FREDERIK takes several steps  --  then turns back to the desk . He tears the letter in two , muttering to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chair . Frederik Grimm , stand up before me ! FREDERIK starts to rise , but changes his mind . Stand up ! FREDERIK rises  --  not knowing why he has risen . PETER points an accusing finger at FREDERIK . Liar to the dead ! Cheat , thief , hypocrite ! You sha' n't have my little girl . You only want her for a week , a day , an hour . I refuse . I have come back to take her from you and you can not put me to rest . I have come back . You can not drive me from your thoughts  --  I am there . Tapping his forehead , without touching it . I am looking over your shoulder in at the window under the door . You are breathing me in the air . I am looking at your heart . He brings his clenched fist down on the desk in answer to FREDERIK 'S gesture ; but , despite the seeming violence of the blow , he makes no sound . Hear me ! You shall hear me ! Hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Hear me ! Will nobody hear me ? Is there no one in this house to hear me ? No one ? Has my journey been in vain ? For the first time fully realizing the situation . Oh , must we stand or fall by the mistakes we made here and the deed we did ? Is there no second chance in this world ? p. 99 FREDERIK With a sneer on his lips as though trying to banish his thoughts . Psh ! MARTA enters with a tray , containing a pot of coffee and a plate of small cakes . PETER , who has watched her with appealing eyes , like a dog craving attention , glances from her to the desk and from the desk back to MARTA  --  trying to tempt her to look at the torn letter . FREDERIK , deep in thought , does not notice her . PETER points to the desk as though to say , " Look ! " After a pause , she picks up the picture and the letter  --  holding them in one hand to clear a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the desk . GRIMM Speaking in a hushed voice . Marta , see what you have in your hand that letter there read it . Run to Catherine with it . Read it from the house-tops . The letter Look ! There you have the story of Annamarie . It is the one way to know the truth in this house  --  the only way . There in your hand  --  the letter . He will never speak . The letter for Catherine . MARTA sets down the picture and the letter ; but something prompts her to look at them ; however , before she can carry out her impulse , FREDERIK starts up . FREDERIK My God ! How you startled me ! MARTA sets down the tray . Oh ! To be off and out of this old rat-trap . He wipes his forehead with his black-bordered handkerchief . I mean  --  our loss comes home to us so keenly here where we are accustomed to see him . p. 100 MARTA A cup of coffee , sir ? FREDERIK No , no , no . MARTA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle 's customs . He always took it at this time . FREDERIK Recovering . Yes , yes , of course . MARTA No word ? FREDERIK Hesitates . What do you mean ? MARTA No letter ? FREDERIK Letter ? Covering the letter with his hand . From whom ? MARTA From At a time like this , I thought I felt that Annamarie that there should be some message . Every day I expect to hear FREDERIK No . PETER gestures to MARTA  --  pointing to the picture and letter , now covered by FREDERIK 'S hand . MARTA Hesitating . Are you certain ? FREDERIK Quite certain . She curtsies and leaves the room . in smaller pieces , lights them in the candle , dropping the burning pieces on a tray . As the flame dies out , FREDERIK brushes the blackened paper into the waste-basket . There 's an end to that ! PETER crouches near the basket  --  hovering over it , his hands clasped helplessly . After a pause , he raises his hand , until it points to a bedroom above . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not with the blaring of brasses , but with the sounds of elfin horns , conveying the impression of a phanton circus band . The door of WILLIAM 'S room opens , and he comes out as though to listen to the music . He wears a sleeping suit and is bare-footed . He has come down stairs before FREDERIK sees him . FREDERIK quickly puts aside the photograph , laying it on the desk , covering it with his hand . p. 101 FREDERIK Gruffly . Why are n't you in bed ? If you 're ill , that 's the proper place for you . WILLIAM I came down to hear the circus music . FREDERIK Circus music ? WILLIAM It woke me up . FREDERIK The circus left town days ago . You must have been dreaming . WILLIAM The band 's playing now . Do n't you hear it , sir ? The procession 's passing . He runs to the window and opens it . The music stops . A breeze sweeps through the room  --  bellies out the curtains and causes the lustres to jingle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost dark . There 's no procession no shining horses . Turning sadly away from the window . I wonder what made me think the  --  I must have been dreaming . Rubbing his eyes . FREDERIK Goes to the window , closes it . The child looks at him and , in retreating from him , unconsciously backs towards PETER . Are you feeling better ? WILLIAM Yes , sir , I feel better  --  and hungry . FREDERIK Go back to bed . WILLIAM Yes , sir . FREDERIK sits . p. 102 GRIMM Where 's your mother , William ? WILLIAM Do you know where Annamarie is ? GRIMM Ah ! FREDERIK Why do you ask me ? What should I know of her ? WILLIAM Grandmother does n't know ; Miss Catherine does n't knows ; nobody knows . FREDERIK I do n't know , either . Tears up the picture  --  turning so that WILLIAM does not see what he is doing . PETER , who has been smiling at WILLIAM , motions him to come nearer . WILLIAM , feeling PETER 'S presence , looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Mr. Grimm ? FREDERIK Dead . WILLIAM Are you sure he 's dead ? ' Cause  --  Puzzled  --  unable to explain himself , he hesitates . FREDERIK Annoyed . You 'd better go to bed . WILLIAM Pointing to a glass of water on a tray . Can I have a drink of water , please ? FREDERIK Go to bed , sir , or you 'll be punished . Water 's not good for little boys with fever . p. 103 WILLIAM Going towards the stairs . Wish I could find a cold brook and lie in it . Goes slowly up the stairs . FREDERIK would destroy the pieces of the picture ; but PETER faces him as though forbidding him to touch it , and , for the first time , FREDERIK imagines he sees the apparition of his uncle . FREDERIK In a very low voice  --  almost inaudibly . My God !

WILLIAM Um ! That 's good ! GRIMM William ! WILLIAM does n't see PETER yet , but he feels his influence . WILLIAM Wish it had been the circus music . GRIMM You shall hear it all again . Gestures towards the plate of cakes on the tray . Come , William , here 's something very nice . WILLIAM Seeing the cakes . Um ! Cakes ! He steals to the tray , looking over his shoulder in fear of being caught . p. 104 GRIMM Do n't be frightened . I 'm here to protect you . Help yourself to the cakes . William , do you think you could deliver a message for me a very important message ? The circus music is heard . WILLIAM sits at the tray and PETER seats himselj opposite as though he were the host doing the honours . WILLIAM , being unconsciously coaxed by PETER , is prevailed upon to choose the biggest cake . He takes a bite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Think I am dreaming . Rubbing his little stomach ecstatically . Hope I wo n't wake up and find there was n't any cake . GRIMM Do n't worry , you wo n't . WILLIAM has taken another piece of cake which he nibbles at  --  now holding a piece in each hand . Pretty substantial dream , eh ? There 's a fine , fat raisin . WILLIAM eats the raisin , then looks into the sugar-bowl . Do n't hesitate , William . Sugar wo n't hurt you now . Nothing can hurt you any more . Fall to , William  --  help yourself . WILLIAM looks over his shoulder , fearing the return of FREDERIK . Oh , he wo n't come back in a hurry . Ha ! Frederik thought he saw me , William ; well , he did n't . He had a bad conscience  --  hallucination . WILLIAM nibbles a lump of sugar . Now , William , I have a message for you . Wo n't you try and take it for me , eh ? But WILLIAM eats another lump of sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance from a boy while his little stomach 's calling . WILLIAM empties the cream jug and helps himself to cakes . Presently the music dies out . Now I 'm going to tell you something . Impressively . You 're a very lucky boy , William ; I congratulate you . Do you know why  --  of all this household  --  you are the only one to help me ? This is the secret : in a little time  --  it wo n't be long  --  you 're going  --  As though he were imparting the most delightful information.  --  to know better ! Think of that ! Is n't the news splendid ? But WILLIAM eats on . Think of what most of us have to endure before we know better ! Why , William , you 're going into the circus without paying for a ticket . You 're laying down the burden before you climb the hill . And in your case , William , you are fortunate indeed ; for there are some little soldiers in this world already handicapped when they begin the battle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle . Like little moon moths ,  --  they look in at the windows ; they beat at the panes ; they see the lights of happy firesides  --  the lights of home ; but they never get in . You are one of these wanderers , William . And so , it is well for you that before your playing time is over  --  before your man 's work begins ,  --  you 're going to know the great secret . Happy boy ! No coarsening of your child 's heart , until you stand before the world like Frederik ; no sweat and toil such as dear old James is facing ; no dimming of the eye and trembling of the hand such as the poor old Doctor shall know in time to come ; no hot tears to blister your eyes , tears such as Katie is shedding now ; but , in all your youth , your faith  --  your innocence ,  --  you 'll fall asleep and oh ! the awakening , William ! " It is well with the child . " WILLIAM lays down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PETER answers his thoughts . What ? No  --  do n't think of it ! Nonsense ! You do n't want to grow up to be a man . Grow up to fail ? Or , still worse  --  to succeed  --  to be famous ? To wear a heavy laurel wreath ? A wreath to be held up by tired hands that ache for one hour 's freedom . No , no , you 're to escape all that , William ; joy is on the way to meet you with sweets in its outstretched hands and laughter on its lips . WILLIAM takes the last swallow of a piece of cake , exclaims " Hm ! " in a satisfied way , brushes the crumbs off his lap , and sits back in his chair . Have you had enough ? Good ! William , I want you to try to understand that you 're to help me , will you ? Will you tell Miss Catherine that  --  p. 105 WILLIAM Without looking up , his hands folded in his lap . Take me back with you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? WILLIAM No , sir ; but I know . GRIMM Come here . WILLIAM does n't move . Here here WILLIAM advances to the center of the room and pauses hesitatingly . Take my hand WILLIAM approaches in the direction of the voice . PETER takes WILLIAM 'S outstretched hand . Have you got it ? WILLIAM No , sir . GRIMM Putting his hand on WILLIAM 'S head . Now ? Do you feel it ? WILLIAM I feel something , yes , sir . Puts his hand on PETER 'S hand , which is still on his head . But where 's your hand ? There 's nothing there . GRIMM But you hear me ? WILLIAM I ca n't really hear you . It 's a dream . Coaxingly . Oh , Mr. Grimm , take me back with you . GRIMM You 're not quite ready to go with me yet , William  --  not until we can see each other face to face . p. 106 WILLIAM Why did you come back , Mr. Grimm ? Was n't it nice where you were ? GRIMM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new toys . WILLIAM To whom the idea appeals . As nice as that ! GRIMM Nicer . But I had to come back with this message . I want you to help me to deliver it . Indicating the picture . WILLIAM Where 's the bosom of Abraham , Mr. Grimm ? GRIMM Eh ? WILLIAM The minister says you 're alseep there . GRIMM Stuff and nonsense ! I have n't been near the bosom of Abraham . WILLIAM Too bad you died before you went to the circus , Mr. Grimm . But it must be great to be in a place where you can look down and see the circus for nothing . Do you remember the clown that sang : " Uncle Rat has gone to town ? " GRIMM Yes , indeed ; but let us talk of something more important . Come here , William He starts towards the desk. ; would you like to see someone whom all little boys love  --  love more than anybody else in the whole world ? PETER is standing at the desk with his finger on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the clown in the circus . No it it is n't a clown ; it 's our mother . Yes , I want to see my mother , Annamarie . Unconsciously WILLIAM comes to the desk and sees the torn picture  --  picks up a piece and looks at it . Very simply . Why there she is ! That 's her face . GRIMM Ah ! You recognize her . Mother 's face is there , William , but it 's in little bits . We must put her together , William . We must show her to everybody in the house , so that everybody will say : " How in the world did she ever get here ? To whom does this picture belong ? " We must set them to thinking . WILLIAM Yes . Let us show her to everybody . He sits and joins the pieces under the guidance of PETER . Annamarie Annamarie GRIMM You remember many things , William things that happened when you lived with Annamarie , do n't you ? WILLIAM I was very little . GRIMM Still , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You loved her . WILLIAM To picture . Oh , yes yes , I loved you . p. 108 GRIMM Now , through that miracle of love , you can remember many things tucked away in your childish brain ,  --  things laid away in your mind like toys upon a shelf . Come , pick them up and dust them off and bring them out again . It will come back . When you lived with Annamarie there was you and Annamarie and  --  WILLIAM  --  and the other one . GRIMM Ah ! We 're getting nearer ! Who was the other one ? WILLIAM Gives a quick glance towards the door  --  then as though speaking to the picture . I must put you together before he comes back . He fits the other pieces together  --  PETER trying to guide him . Presently WILLIAM hums as a child will when at play , singing the tune of " Uncle Rat . " " Uncle Rat has gone to town . " PETER AND WILLIAM Singing together . " Ha ! H 'm ! " At this instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILLIAM Her other foot . Then sings . " Uncle Rat has gone to town , To buy his niece a wedding gown .

Hard boiled eggs and  --  " Speaking . Where 's  --  WILLIAM pauses  --  looking for a piece of the picture . GRIMM Finishing the verse . " A cup of tea . " With a gesture as though knocking on the door of the adjoining room to attract MRS . BATHOLOMMEY 'S attention . WILLIAM Speaks . There 's her hat . WILLIAM AND PETER Singing . " Ha ! H 'm ! " WILLIAM Stops singing and claps his hands with boyish delight  --  staring at the picture . Annamarie ! Annamarie ! You 're not in bits any more  --  you 're all put together . By this time , PETER is going up the stairs , and , as he stands in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and CATHERINE comes out . CATHERINE Astonished . Why , William ! What are you doing here ? p. 110 WILLIAM Miss Catherine ! Come down ! Come down ! I have something to show you . CATHERINE Not coming down . No , dear  --  come upstairs ; there 's a good boy . You must n't play down there . Come to bed . Passes into WILLIAM 'S room . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Who has entered , and sees WILLIAM . William ! WILLIAM Look  --  look ! Pointing to the picture . See what old Mr. Grimm brought back with him . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Alarmed . What are you talking about , William ? Old Mr. Grimm is dead . WILLIAM No , he is n't ; he 's come back . He has been in this room . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Absurd ! WILLIAM I was talking to him . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY You 're feverish again . I must get the Doctor . Comes down to WILLIAM . And I thought you were feeling better ! Seeing CATHERINE , who appears on the balcony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The child 's mind is wandering . He imagines all sorts of things . I 'll call the Doctor  --  p. 111 GRIMM Who has re-entered . You need n't  --  he 's coming now . Come in , Andrew . I 'm giving you one more chance . The DOCTOR enters , wearing his skull-cap , and carrying his pipe in his hand . It is evident that he has come over in a hurry . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Surprised . I was just going for you . How fortunate that you came . MACPHERSON I though I 'd have another peep at William . By this time , CATHERINE has seated herself on a chair , and takes WILLIAM on her lap . He puts his arms round her neck . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY He 's quite delirious MACPHERSON Does n't look it . Putting his hand on WILLIAM 'S cheek and forehead . Very slight fever . What makes you think he was delirious ? Taking WILLIAM 'S pulse . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Interrupting . He said that old Mr. Grimm was in this room  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Really ? Well , possibly he is . Nothing remarkable in that , is there ? p. 112 GRIMM Well , at last ! MRS . BATHOLOMMEY What ? Oh , of course , you believe in  --  MACPHERSON In fact , I had a compact with him to return if  --  MRS . BATHOLOMMEY A compact ? Of all the preposterous  --  MACPHERSON Not at all . Dozens of cases on record  --  as I can show you  --  where these compacts have actually been kept . Suddenly struck  --  looking at WILLIAM . I wonder if that boy 's sensitive . Hand on his chin . I wonder CATHERINE Echoing the DOCTOR 'S words . A sensitive ? MRS . BATHOLOMMEY What 's that ? MACPHERSON It 's difficult to explain . I mean a human organism so constituted that it can be informed or controlled by those who  --  er  --  have  --  With a gesture. crossed over . MRS .

William , are you sure he MACPHERSON Said to you , eh ? WILLIAM nods assent . Old Mr. Grimm ? WILLIAM nods . Sure of that , William ? WILLIAM Oh , yes , sir . MACPHERSON Think before you speak , my boy ; what did Mr. Grimm say to you ? WILLIAM Lots of things MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Really ! MACPHERSON Raises his hand for silence . How did he look , William ? WILLIAM I did n't see him . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Ha ! MACPHERSON You must have seen something . WILLIAM I thought once I saw his hat on the peg where it used to hang . Looks at the peg . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remonstrating . Doctor ! MACPHERSON Thinking . I wonder if he really did  --  CATHERINE Do you think he could have seen Uncle Peter ? GRIMM Pointing to the desk . William ! WILLIAM Look ! Points to the picture . That 's what I wanted to show you when you were upstairs CATHERINE Seeing the picture . It 's his mother  --  Annamarie . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY The Lord save us  --  his mother ! I did n't know you 'd heard from Annamarie . CATHERINE We have n't . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Then how 'd that picture get into the house ? GRIMM Ah ! I knew she 'd begin ! Now that she 's wound up , we shall get at the truth . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY It 's a new picture . She 's much changed . Howe ever did it find its way here ? CATHERINE I never saw it before . It 's very strange . We 've all been waiting for news of her . Even her mother does n't know where she is , or  --  could Marta have received this since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Exit into dining-room . CATHERINE If not , who had the picture ? And why were n't we all told ? Who tore it up ? Did you , William ? WILLIAM shakes his head , meaning " No . " Who has been at the desk ? No one save Frederik Frederik and surely he  --  She pauses  --  perplexed . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Re-entering . No , Marta has n't heard a word ; and , only a few minutes ago , she asked Frederik if some message had n't come , but he said " No , nothing . " I did n't tell her of the picture . CATHERINE Looking at the picture . I wonder if there was any message with it . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY I remember the day that picture came the day your uncle died . It was in a long blue envelope  --  the size of the picture . I took it from the postman myself because every one was distracted and rushing about . It dropped to the floor and as I picked it up I thought I knew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was directed to your uncle . Looking from the desk to the waste-basket .

But what could Peter have to say to me concerning Annamarie ? Making a resolution  --  rising . We 're going to find out . You may draw the curtains , Catherine , if you please . CATHERINE draws the curtains . The DOCTOR turns the lights down and closes the door . A pause . Peter Grimm GRIMM Yes , Andrew ? MACPHERSON Not hearing . If you have come back if you are in the room and the boy speaks truly  --  give me some sign some indication GRIMM I ca n't give you a sign , Andrew . I have spoken to the boy the boy MACPHERSON If you can not make your presence known to me  --  I know there are great difficulties  --  will you try and send your message by William ? I presume you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or else you would n't have come back . GRIMM That 's just the point I wanted to make , Andrew . You understand perfectly . p. 117 MACPHERSON As before . I am waiting . We are all waiting . Noticing that a door is a trifle ajar . The door 's open again . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY , without making a sound , closes it and sits as before . GRIMM Sh ! Listen ! A pause . WILLIAM In a peculiar manner  --  as though in a half dream  --  but not shutting his eyes . As though controlled by PETER . There was Annamarie and me and the other . MACPHERSON Very low , as though afraid to interrupt WILLIAM 'S train of thought . What other ? WILLIAM The man that came . MACPHERSON What man ? WILLIAM The man that made Annamarie cry . CATHERINE Who was he ? WILLIAM I do n't know GRIMM Yes , you do . Do n't tell lies , William . MACPHERSON What man made Annamarie cry ?

MACPHERSON When , William ? WILLIAM Just now CATHERINE AND MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Together . Just now ! MACPHERSON H 'm . You both ask the same question , eh ? The man that came to see  --  MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Perplexed . It ca n't be possible that the child knows what he 's talking about . MACPHERSON Ingoring her . What did you tell Mr. Grimm when he asked you ? GRIMM You 'd better make haste , William . Frederik is coming back . p. 119 WILLIAM Looking uneasily over his shoulder . I 'm afraid . CATHERINE Why does he always look towards that door ? You 're not afraid now , William ? WILLIAM Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't let Mr. Frederik come back . ' Cause then I 'll be afraid again . MACPHERSON Ah ! GRIMM William ! William ! WILLIAM Rising quickly . Yes , Mr. Grimm ? GRIMM You must say that I am very unhappy . WILLIAM He says he is very unhappy . MACPHERSON Why is he unhappy ? Ask him . WILLIAM Why are you unhappy , Mr. Grimm ? GRIMM I am thinking of Catherine 's future . WILLIAM Not understanding the last word  --  puzzled . Eh ? GRIMM To-morrow WILLIAM After a slight pause . To-morrow GRIMM Catherine 's  --  p. 120 WILLIAM Looks at CATHERINE  --  hesitating . Your  --  Stops . CATHERINE gives the DOCTOR a quick glance  --  she seems to divine the message .

I 'm afraid I 'm afraid he will make Annamarie cry ; he makes me cry CATHERINE With suppressed excitement  --  half to herself . Why are you afraid of him ? Was Frederik the man that came to see Annamarie ? MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Catherine ! CATHERINE On her knees before WILLIAM . Was he ? Was it Frederik Grimm ? Tell me , William . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Surely you do n't believe CATHERINE In a low voice . I 've thought of a great many things to-day little things little things I 'd never noticed before . I 'm putting them together just as he put that picture together . I must know the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the door . WILLIAM Frightened . I wo n't say any more . He 's there at the door He looks over his shoulder and CATHERINE goes towards the door . p. 122 MACPHERSON William , tell me . GRIMM William ! CATHERINE opens the door suddenly . FREDERIK is standing , listening . He is taken unawares and for a few seconds he does not move  --  then he recovers . WILLIAM Please do n't let him scold me . I 'm afraid of him . Going towards the stairs  --  looking at FREDERIK . I was afraid of him when I lived with Annamarie and he came to see us and made her cry . MACPHERSON Are you sure you remember that ? Were n't you too small ? WILLIAM No , I do remember . I always did remember ; only for a little while I  --  I forgot . I must go to bed . He told me to . Goes upstairs .

Why did you tell me that you 'd never seen her since she went away ? Why did you lie to me ? Why do you hate that child ? p. 123 FREDERIK Are you going to believe what that boy  --  CATHERINE I 'm going to find out . I 'm going to find out where she is , before I marry you . That child may be right or wrong ; but I 'm going to know what his mother was to you . I want the truth . MACPHERSON Who has been in thought  --  now looking up . We 've heard the truth . We had that message from Peter Grimm himself . CATHERINE Yes , it is true . I believe Uncle Peter Grimm was in this room to-night . FREDERIK Not surprised  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw him . Oh ! You , too ? Did you see him , too ? MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Incredulously . Impossible ! CATHERINE I do n't care what anyone else may think  --  people have the right to think for themselves ; but I believe he has been here  --  he is here . Uncle Peter , if you can hear me now , give me back my promise  --  or  --  or I 'll take it back ! GRIMM Gently  --  smilingly  --  relieved. @x The third act takes place at twently minutes to twelve on the same night . The fire is out . The table on which PETER took his coffee in the first act is now being used by the DOCTOR for WILLIAM 'S medicines , two bottles , two glasses , two teaspoons , a clinical thermometer , &amp; c . WILLIAM , who has been questioned by the DOCTOR , is now asleep upstairs . PETER 'S hat hangs on the peg in the shadow . Although the hour is late , no one has thought of going to bed . FREDERIK is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send to arrange for the sale of PETER GRIMM 'S nurseries , but he has not arrived . The DOCTOR , full of his theories , is seated before the fire , writing the account of PETER GRIMM 'S return , for the American Branch of the " London Society for Psychical Research . " It is now a fine , clear night . The clouds are almost silvery and a hint of the moon is showing . MACPHERSON Reading what he has written .

Well , Doctor : She pushes forward a chair and sits at the other side of the table  --  facing him. the breaking off of the engagement is rather sudden , is n't it ? We 've been talking it over in the front parlour , Mr. Batholommey and I. James has finished his work and has just joined us . I suggest sending out a card  --  a neat card  --  saying that , owing to the bereavement in the family , the wedding has been indefinitely postponed . Of course , it is n't exactly true . p. 126 MACPHERSON Wo n't take place at all . Goes on reading . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Evidently not ; but if the whole matter looks very strange to me  --  how is it going to look to other people ; especially when we have n't any  --  any rational explanation  --  as yet ? We must get out of it in some fashion . MACPHERSON Whose business is it ? MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position is certainly unusual ; and the strangest part of it all is  --  she does n't seem to feel her situation . She 's sitting alone in the library , seemingly placid and happy . What I really wish to consult you about is this : should n't the card we 're going to send out have a narrow black border ? The DOCTOR is now writing . Doctor , you do n't appear to be interested . You might at least answer my question . MACPHERSON What chance have I had to answer ? You 've done all the talking . MRS . BATHOLOMMEY Rising  --  annoyed . Oh , of course , all these little matters sound trivial to you ; but men like you could n't look after the workings of the next world if other people did n't attend to this . Some one has to do it .

BATHOLOMMEY Sweeping on.  --  theories against the good black of a minister 's coat . I think myself that you have probably stumbled on the truth about William 's mother .

Do n't you think , Doctor  --  mind , I 'm not opposing your ideas as a clergyman ,  --  I 'm just echoing what everybody else thinks  --  do n't you believe these spiritualistic ideas , leading away from the Heaven we were taught to believe in , tend towards irresponsibility  --  er  --  eccentricity  --  and  --  often  --  er  --  insanity ? Is it healthy  --  that 's the idea  --  is it healthy ? p. 129 MACPHERSON Well , Batholommey , religion has frequently led to the stake , and I never heard of the Spanish Inquisition being called healthy for anybody taking part in it . Still , religion flourishes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blew up ten years ago  --  went out . My Heaven 's just coming in . It 's new . Dr. Funk and a lot of the clergymen are in already .

" I assisted in the carrying out of his instructions . " FREDERIK GRIMM enters . FREDERIK Anybody in this house come to their senses yet ? MACPHERSON I think so , my boy . I think several in this house have come to their senses . Catherine has , for one . I 'm very glad to see you back , Frederik . I have a few questions to put to you . FREDERIK Why do n't you have more light ? It 's half dark in this room . He picks up the lamp from the DOCTOR 'S table and holds it so that he can look searchingly in the direction of the desk to see if PETER 'S apparition is still there . His eye is suddenly riveted on the telegram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telegram for me ? MACPHERSON Yes . FREDERIK Oh . It may explain perhaps why I 've been kept waiting at the hotel . Tries to go to the desk but can not muster up courage . I had an appointment to meet a man who wanted to buy the gardens . I may as well tell you , I 'm thinking of selling out root and branch . p. 131 MACPHERSON Amazed . Selling out ? Peter Grimm 's gardens ? So this is the end of Peter 's great work ? FREDERIK You 'll think it strange , Doctor ; but I  --  I simply ca n't make up my mind to go near that old desk of my uncle 's . I have a perfect terror of the thing ! Would you mind handing me that telegram ? The DOCTOR looks at him with scarcely veiled contempt , and hands him the telegram . After a glance at the contents , FREDERIK gives vent to a long-drawn breath . Billy Hicks  --  the man I was to sell to  --  is dead . Tosses the telegram across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It lies on the table . I knew it this afternoon ! I knew he would die but I would n't let myself believe it . Someone told it to me whispered it to me . Doctor , as sure as you live  --  somebody else is doing my thinking for me in this house . MACPHERSON Studying FREDERIK . What makes you say that ? FREDERIK To-night  --  in this room , I thought I saw my uncle Pointing towards the desk. there . MACPHERSON Eh ? FREDERIK And just before I  --  I saw him  --  I  --  I had the the strangest impulse to go to the foot of the stairs and call Kitty  --  give her the house  --  and run  --  run  --  get out of it . p. 132 MACPHERSON Oh , a good impulse , I see ! Very unusual , I should say . FREDERIK I thought he gave me a terrible look  --  a terrible look . MACPHERSON Your uncle ? FREDERIK Yes . My God ! I wo n't forget that look ! And as I started out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I saw him blot out ; then I left the photograph on the desk and  --  MACPHERSON That 's how William came by it . Jots down a couple of notes . Did you ever have this impulse before  --  to give up Catherine  --  to let her have the cottage ? FREDERIK Not much , I had n't . Certainly not . I told you someone else was thinking for me . I do n't want to give her up . It 's folly ! I 've always been fond of her . But if she has turned against me , I 'm not going to sit here and cry about it . I shall be up and off . Rising . But I 'll tell you one thing : from this time , I propose to think for myself . I 've taken a room at the hotel and a few things for the night . I 've done with this house . I 'd like to sell it along with the gardens , and let a stranger raze it to the ground ; but  --  Thinks as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to-night  --  it 's hers  --  she can have it . I would n't sleep here . I give her the home because p. 133 MACPHERSON Because you do n't believe anything ; but you want to be on the safe side in case he  --  Gesturing to desk. was there . FREDERIK Puzzled  --  awed  --  his voice almost dropping to a whisper . How do you account for it , Doctor ? MACPHERSON It might have been an hallucination or perhaps you did see him , though it could have been inflammation of conscience , Frederik : when did you last see Annamarie ? FREDERIK Angrily . Have n't I told you already that I refuse to answer any questions as to my  --  MACPHERSON I think it only fair to tell you that it wo n't make a particle of difference whether you answer me or not . I have someone on the track now  --  working from an old address ; I 've called in the detectives and I 'll find her , you may be sure of that . As long as I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of it , too . When did you last see Annamarie ? FREDERIK Sits  --  answers dully , mechanically , after a pause . About three years ago . MACPHERSON Never since ? FREDERIK No . MACPHERSON What occurred the last time you saw her ? p. 134 FREDERIK Quietly , as before . What always occurs when a young man realizes that he has his life before him , must be respected  --  looked up to , settle down , think of his future and forget a silly girl ? MACPHERSON A scene took place , eh ? Was William present ? FREDERIK Yes . She held him in her arms . MACPHERSON And then ? FREDERIK I left the house . MACPHERSON Then it 's all true . FREDERIK is silent . What are you going to do for William ? FREDERIK Nothing . I 'm a rich man now  --  and if I recognize him  --  he 'll be at me till the day he dies . His mother 's gone to the dogs and under her influence , the boy  --  MACPHERSON Be silent , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charity if the good Lord took William , and I say it with all my heart . Out of all you have  --  not a crumb for  --  FREDERIK I want you to know I 've sweat for that money , and I 'm going to keep it ! MACPHERSON You 've sweat for  --  FREDERIK Showing feeling.  --  Yes ! How do you think I got the money ? I went to jail for it  --  jail , jail . Every day I 've been in this house has been spent in prison . I 've been doing time . Do you think it did n't get on my nerves ? I 've gone to bed at nine o'clock and thought of what I was missing in New York . I 've got up at cock-crow to be in time for grace at the breakfast table . I took charge of a class in Sabbath-school , and I handed out the infernal cornucopias at the church Christmas tree , while he played Santa Claus . What more can a fellow do to earn his money ? Do n't you call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a damned hand-organ monkey for the pennies he left me , and I had to grin and touch my hat and make believe I liked it . Now I 'm going to spend every cent for my own personal pleasure . p. 135 MACPHERSON Will rich men never learn wisdom ! FREDERIK Rising . No , they wo n't ! But in every fourth generation there comes along a wise fellow  --  a spender who knows how to distribute the money others have hoarded : I 'm the spender . MACPHERSON Shame upon you and your like ! Your breed should be exterminated . FREDERIK Taking a little packet of letters from the desk . Oh , no , we 're quite as necessary as you are . And now  --  I shall answer no more questions . I 'm done . Good-night , Doctor . MACPHERSON Good-night and good-bye . With a look of disgust , he has gone to the table , held a medicine bottle to the light to look at the label and poured a spoonful into a wine-glass filled with water . As FREDERIK leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls . Catherine ! CATHERINE enters , and shows by the glance she directs at the front door that she knows FREDERIK has been in the room and has just left the house . Burn up your wedding dress . We 've made no mistake . I can tell you that ! Goes up the stairs to WILLIAM 'S room , taking the lamp with him . JAMES has entered , and , taking CATHERINE 'S hand , holds it for a moment . p. 136 HARTMAN Good-night , Catherine . She turns and lays her hand on his shoulder . CATHERINE I wonder , James , if he can see us now . HARTMAN That 's the big mystery ! Who can tell ? But any man who works with flowers and things that grow  --  knows there is no such thing as death  --  there 's nothing but life  --  life and always life . I 'll be back in the morning . Wo n't you see me to the door ? CATHERINE Yes yes . They go up together , CATHERINE carrying a candle into the dark vestibule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piano goes out as though the draught from the door or an unseen hand had extinguished it . It is now quite dark outside , and the moon is hidden for a moment . At the same time , a light , seemingly coming from nowhere , reveals PETER GRIMM standing in the room at the door  --  as though he had been there when the young people passed out . He is smiling and happy . The moon is not seen , but the light of it ( as though it had come out from behind a cloud ) now reveals the old windmill . From outside the door the voices of JAMES and CATHERINE are heard as they both say : Good-night . HARTMAN Catherine , I wo n't go without it . p. 137 GRIMM Knowing that JAMES is demanding a kiss . Aha ! Rubs his hands in satisfaction  --  then listens  --  and after a second pause exclaims , with an upraised finger , as though he were hearing the kiss . Ah ! Now I can go . He walks to the peg on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His work is done . CATHERINE re-enters , darting into the hall in girlish confusion , JAMES ' HAPPY VOICE Outside . Good-night ! CATHERINE Calling to him through the crack in the door . Good-night ! She closes the door , turns the key and draws the heavy bolt  --  then leans against the door , candle-stick in hand  --  the wind has blown out the candle . Oh , I 'm so happy ! I 'm so happy ! GRIMM Then good-night to you , my darling : love can not say good-bye . She goes to PETER 'S chair , and , sitting , thinks it all over  --  her hands clasped in her lap  --  her face radiant with happiness . Here in your childhood 's home I leave you . Here in the years to come , the way lies clear before you . His arm upraised . " Lust in Rust "  --  Pleasure and Peace go with you . CATHERINE looks towards the door  --  remembering JAMES ' kiss  --  half smiling . Humorously . Y  --  es ; I saw you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day when , as a wife , you look out upon my gardens  --  every flower and tree and shrub shall bloom enchanted to your eyes . All that happens  --  happens again . And if , at first , a little knock of poverty taps at the door , and James finds the road hard and steep  --  what is money ?  --  a thing ,  --  a good thing to have ,  --  but still a thing and happiness will come without it . And when , as a mother , you shall see my plantings with new eyes , my Catherine ,  --  when you explain each leaf and bud to your little people  --  you will remember the time when we walked together through the leafy lanes and I taught you  --  even as you teach them  --  you little thing ! So , I shall linger in your heart . And some day , should your children wander far away and my gardens blossom for a stranger who may take my name from off the gates ,  --  what is my name ? Already it grows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes , let others take my work . Why should we care ? All that happens , happens again . She rests her elbow on the chair , half hides her face in her hand . And never forget this : I shall be waiting for you  --  I shall know all your life . I shall adore your children and be their grandfather just as though I were here ; I shall find it hard not to laugh at them when they are bad , and I shall worship them when they are good  --  and I do n't want them too good . Frederik was good . I shall be everywhere about you in the stockings at Christmas , in a big , busy , teeming world of shadows just outside your threshold , or whispering in the still noises of the night . And oh ! as the years pass , Standing over her chair. you can not imagine what pride I shall take in your comfortable middle life  --  the very best age , I think  --  when you two shall look out on your possessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease . How I shall love to see you look fondly at each other as you say : " Be happy , Jim  --  you 've worked hard for this ; " or James says : " Take your comfort , little mother , let them all wait upon you  --  you waited upon them . Lean back in your carriage  --  you 've earned it ! " And towards the end  --  Sitting on a chair by her side and looking into her face. after all the luxuries and vanities and possessions cease to be so important  --  people return to very simple things , dear . The evening of life comes bearing its own lamp . Then , perhaps , as a little old grandmother , a little old child whose bed-time is drawing near , I shall see you happy to sit out in the sunlight of another day ; asking nothing more of life than the few hours to be spent with those you love , telling your grandchildren , at your knees , how much brighter the flowers blossomed when you were young . Ha ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And when , one glad day , glorified , radiant , young once more , the mother and I shall take you in our arms ,  --  oh ! what a reunion ! Inspired . The flight of love  --  to love . And now He bends over her and caresses her hand. good-night . CATHERINE rises and , going to the desk , buries her face in the bunch of flowers placed there in memory of PETER . p. 138 CATHERINE Dear Uncle Peter . MARTA enters  --  pausing to hear if all is quiet in WILLIAM 'S room . CATHERINE , lifting her face , sees MARTA and rapturously hugs her , to MARTA 'S amazement  --  then goes up the stairs . GRIMM Whose eyes never leave CATHERINE . " Lust in Rust ! " Pleasure and Peace ! Amen ! CATHERINE passes into her room , the music dying away as her door closes . MARTA , still wondering , goes to the clock and winds it . Poor Marta ! Every time she thinks of me , she winds my clock . We 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapped up in an old-fashioned Dutch patchwork quilt . The DOCTOR has a lamp in his free hand . So you want to go downstairs , eh ? Very good ! How do you feel , laddie ? WILLIAM New all over . MACPHERSON Placing the lamp on the little table right , and laying WILLIAM on the couch . Now I 'll get you the glass of cold water . Goes into the dining-room , leaving the door open . GRIMM Calling after the DOCTOR . Good-night , Andrew . I 'm afraid the world will have to wait a little longer for the big guesser . Drop in often . I shall be glad to see you here . p. 139 WILLIAM Quickly rising on the couch , looks towards the peg on which PETER GRIMM 'S hat hung . Calling . Mr. Grimm ! Where are you ? I knew that you were down here . Seeing PETER . Oh , Raising himself to his knees on the sofa . I see you now ! GRIMM Yes ? There is an impressive pause and silence as they face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat ; it 's off the peg . You 're going . Need you go right away  --  Mr. Grimm ? Ca n't you wait a little while ? GRIMM I 'll wait for you , William . WILLIAM May I go with you ? Thank you . I could n't find the way without you . GRIMM Yes , you could . It 's the surest way in this world . But I 'll wait ,  --  do n't worry . WILLIAM I sha' n't . Coaxingly . Do n't be in a hurry I want  --  Lies down happily. to take a nap first . I 'm sleepy . He pulls the covering up and sleeps . GRIMM I wish you the pleasantest dream a little boy can have in this world . Instantly , as though the room were peopled with faint images of WILLIAM 'S dream , the phantom circus music is heard , with its elfin horns ; and , through the music , voices call " Hai ! Hai ! " The sound of the cracking of a whip is heard , and the blare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice of theCLOWN ( very faint ) calls : p. 140 THE CLOWN Billy Miller 's big show and monster circus is in town this afternoon ! Do n't forget the date ! Only one ring  --  no confusion . Circus day comes but once a year , little sir . Come early and see the wild animals and hear the lion roar-r-r ! Mind , I shall expect you ! Wonderful troupe of trained mice in the side-show . During the above , the deeper voice of a " HAWKER "  --  muffled and far off  --  cries : HAWKER 'S VOICE Peanuts , pop-corn , lemonade  --  ice cold lemo  --  lemo  --  lemonade ! Circus day comes but once a year . Breaking in through the music , and the voices of the CLOWN and HAWKER , the gruff voice of a " BARKER " is heard calling . BARKER 'S VOICE Walk in and see the midgets and the giant ! Only ten cents  --  one dime ! As these voices die away , the CLOWN , whose voice indicates that he is now perched on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Rat has gone to town , Ha ! H 'm ! Uncle Rat has gone to townTo buy his niece "  --  His voice ends abruptly  --  the music stops . Everything is over . There is silence . Then three clear knocks sound on the door . GRIMM Come in . The door opens . No one is there  --  but a faint path of phosphorous light is seen . Oh , friends ! Troops of you ! As though he recognizes the unseen guests . I 've been gone so long that you came for me , eh ? I 'm quite ready to go back . I 'm just waiting for a happy little fellow who 's going back with us . We 'll follow . Do you all go ahead  --  lead the way . He looks at WILLIAM , holds out his arms , and WILLIAM jumps up and runs into them . Well , William ! You know better now . Come ! Picking up WILLIAM . Happy , eh ? WILLIAM nods , his face beaming . p. 141 WILLIAM Oh , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they turn towards the door . MACPHERSON Re-entering , goes to the couch with the water , and suddenly , setting down the glass , exclaims in a hushed voice : My God ! He 's dead ! He half raises up a boy that appears to be WILLIAM . The light from the lamp on the table falls on the dead face of the child . Then the DOCTOR gently lays the boy down again on the couch , and sits pondering over the mystery of death . GRIMM To the DOCTOR . Oh , no ! There never was so fair a prospect for life ! WILLIAM In PETER 'S arms . I am happy ! Outside a hazy moonlight shimmers . A few stars twinkle in the far-away sky ; and the low moon is seen back of the old windmill . GRIMM To WILLIAM . If the rest of them only knew what they 're missing , eh ? WILLIAM Begins to sing , joyously . " Uncle Rat has gone to town . " PETER dances up a few steps towards the door , singing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H 'm ! Uncle Rat has gone to townTo buy his niece a wedding gown.Ha ! H 'm ! " GRIMM Gives one last fond look towards CATHERINE 'S room . To WILLIAM . We 're off ! Putting the boy over his shoulder , they sing together , as they go up , the phantom circus music accompanying them . " What shall the wedding breakfast be ? Ha ! H 'm ! " GRIMM Alone . " What shall the wedding breakfast be ? Hard boiled eggs and a cup of tea . " WILLIAM AND PETER " Ha ! H 'm ! " PETER GRIMM has danced off with the child through the faint path of light . As he goes , the wind or an unseen hand closes the door after them . There is a moment 's pause until their voices are no longer heard  --  then the curtain slowly descends . The air of the song is taken up by an unseen orchestra and continues as the audience passes out .               @ @ @ @ @ @
