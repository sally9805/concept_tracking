The one part of the President 's message to Congress upon which every reader of it will eagerly fix is that dealing with the questions of national defence , and of the duties of this country growing out of the European war . Mr. Wilson discusses other matters . He makes certain recommendations which will be the subject of controversy . But they will be overlooked to-day . Everything will be for the moment forgotten except the passages of his address in which he sets forth his conception of the correct military policy of the United States . The President had already briefly informed Representative Gardner that he was opposed to the special inquiry into our preparedness for war . Before Congress on Tuesday he went into the whole subject . Mr. Gardner had expressed the fear that the President would lay " the cold hand of death " upon his pet project . But all that Mr. Wilson lays upon it is the cold hand of reason . Of that , Gardner has much more cause to be afraid than of death . So have the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defend itself . To them all the President says , " Come and let us reason together . " His discussion of national defence is eminently reasonable , looking before and after . The possibility of disarmament he does not even refer to . He merely affirms that we have had a consistent American military policy , purely defensive in motive ; that the navy and the army have not been , as rashly alleged , neglected ; that a normal and moderate increase in the strength of both is to be expected and , indeed , is planned for ; and that nothing in the situation growing out of the European war should cause us nervous apprehension or lead to a panicky change of our historic policy . President Wilson 's calm assertion is that " no one who speaks counsel based on fact or drawn from a just and candid interpretation of realities can say that there is a reason to fear that from any quarter our independence or the integrity of our territory is threatened. , " This is his answer to the horrid imaginings which have affrighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is accepted as accurate by a man who , on general principles , favors a comprehensive inquiry into our military expenditures . In them Professor Emery of Yale believes that there has been much lack of coOrdination and waste ; and would like to have a " quiet consideration " of all these matters . But he is as much averse as the President is to losing our self-possession , or to countenancing a " panicky movement " of any kind And he adds , in strong confirmation of the President : I am not one of those who believe that the present European war has increased our own dangers of attack from outside . On the contrary , I believe just the opposite Whichever side wins in this great conflict , the result will mean such an exhaustion of resources , such a weariness of war , that no member of either side is likely to attack us for years to come We have placed these considerations first , because they come first strategically . The President is not content with merely setting his face negatively against impulsive efforts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He shows what has been done , and what we may reasonably expect will be done , in attending to due measures of national defence . It is a part of the work of Government which , he says , must not be neglected , and has not been . He is careful to guard against misconception . Because he declines to throw himself into the arms of the flustered extremists , they must not say that he is indifferent to this or any other demonstrated need of the nation . All this is unquestionably sound tactics and good politics . It will make it much easier for the Democrats in Congress to stand with the President . Already , in fact , they are beginning to carry the war into the Republican camp . " You say that we have no navy fit to put to sea , and that our army is a broken reed . Then what have you done with the billions of money of which your party has had the spending for the military forces ? " It is , however , when President Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American people that he is most effective . It is hard to read his moving re-statement of old truths without a gladdening of the heart . Praise falls away from the fine eloquence of this part of the President 's address , with the feeling that there is nothing to do but to urge everybody to read it and lay it to heart . It is the true American voice . Mr. Wilson declares that he has tried to find out what the mass of the plain People are really thinking and feeling and hoping . There can be no doubt that he has come nearer doing it than have the clamorers for war and for mighty preparations for war . Defence ? Yes , if necessary . But we are not to conjure up vague fears . Thoughts of aggression we are to put far from us . Conquest of other lands is as much ruled out as conquest of our own . We are to give the old ideal America a free course to run and be glorified . All this is magnificently put by the President . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the criminal folly of doing anything at this time to destroy the splendid opportunity which may soon be ours to help the world to peace and healing . As for our national defences , we may all feel that we have one mighty bulwark  --  a President who has met the crisis with poise and energy , and who defends us against those of our own citizens who forget the true grandeur of this nation . As the President says : To develop our life and our resources ; to supply our own people , and the people of the world as their need arises , from the abundant plenty of our fields and our marts of trade ; to enrich the commerce of our own States and of the world with the products of our mines , our farms , and our factories , with the creations of our thought and the fruits of our character  --  this is , what will hold our attention and our enthusiasm steadily , now and in the years to come , as we strive to show in our life as a nation what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for men and for societies , for individuals , for States , and for mankind . THE CROWN PRINCE ON THE WAR . The defence made by Germans against the charge that on their country lies the responsibility for having brought on this war has taken two forms . Some insist that the Kaiser and his Government made every effort to prevent the collision , and that they were thwarted by the bellicose acts of Russia , or by the deceitful diplomacy of England. - By others , all the emphasis has been laid upon the situation in which Germany found herself : shut in by an iron ring of foes , throUgh which she had to break by force of arms , war was her only recourse if she was to remain a great nation . Both pleas have been used by one and the same person in one and the same utterance , though it is hard to make them go together . No such attempt is visible in the words of the Crown Prince . When at the outset he declares that " this whole business " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany had no choice in the matter , " it might be possible to understand these words , taken by themselves , as meaning that , in the critical days of the last week of July , Germany had done all in her power to prevent the war ? a contention which , as we have more than once set forth , is completely disposed of by patent facts . But this is not in the least what the Crown Prince means . Germany 's justification in the war , Germany 's right to say that the war was forced upon her , does not rest , in the Crown Prince 's mind , upon any details of the events of four months ago . What he talks of is the iron ring ; " we foresaw , and as far as possible forestalled , the attempt to crush us within this ring . " And he goes farther . Speaking not only for himself , but for the whole German people , he lays down a view of the " iron ring " which goes beyond the wildest assertions as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible source . " No power on earth , " he declares , " will ever be able to convince our people that this war was not engineered solely and wholly with a view to crushing the German , people , their Government , their institutions , and all that they hold dear . " Concerning the attitude of the Triple Entente towards Germany , there is ample room for diversity of judgment . That it was natural for her to feel aggrieved at being balked in the oversea ambitions which she cherished , nearly every one will admit ; though to what extent even this degree of hostility to her on the part of her neighbors was due to resentment and suspicion caused by her own militarism is a question that can not be ignored . Between this grievance , however , and that terrible " iron ring " of which we hear so much there is a great gap . That the two things look like one to the German imperialist mind is itself an illustration of the way in which a nation , no less than an individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and when it comes to a belief that what the Triple En-tenth all along was after was to " crush the German people , their Government , their institutions , and all that they hold dear , " we pass beyond the region of obsession and arrive at that of pure hallucination . How a mind filled with the imperialist ideal and imbued with the militarist spirit passes from the realm of sober reality to that of vague and grandiose visions can hardly be better illustrated than by comparing this statement of the Crown Prince with what he was in the habit of saying before the war . It happens that , in the July number of the leading Austrian magazine , the Oesterreichische Rundschau , the principal article was upon the Crown Prince as the exponent of German imperialism . Here we find his well-known glorification of war , his proud consciousness of the martial tradition of his race , his conviction that only by the maintenance of that tradition can Germany remain a'great and noble nation . But not a word about any danger that the German people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defence against a foe threatening her life , but quite a different motif runs through all his exaltation of preparedness for war and of joy in battle . " The German Empire , " he said in a famous outgiving a few years ' ago , " has , more than any other of the peoples of our old earth , the sacred duty to maintainher army and her navy always at the highest point of readiness to strike . Only so , relying on our good sword , can we obtain the place in the sun which is our due ; but is not voluntarily conceded to us . " Expansion , not self-preservation , was then the sufficient ground for Germany 's readiness to fight ; and nothing could be plainer from the whole tenor of the Crown Prince 's thought , as shown in the Rumischau 's approving article , than that he and his fellow-imperialists looked upon war as not only the natural , but the desirable , means of giving expression to the nation 's aspirations . It is not necessary to suppose that the Crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmoved by the sight of suffering . The world 's quarrel with him and his kind is not a personal one ; to the millions laid low by this war it matters little whether he is a Prince Charming or a Blue-beard . What affects the world is not his personal merits or defects , but that attitude towards the world 's deepest and most vital concerns which he and those who stand with him represent . " There is no war party In Germany now , and there never has been , " he says ; and the more sincere he is in saying it , the more hopeless is the gulf that separates him from what , here in America at least , we still fondly think of as the spirit of our age . There is a war party here  --  a small one , to be sure ; there is a war party in France , in England ; if the Crown Prince can think that there is no war party in G , ermany , it can only be because he imagines that his own love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a whole nation regards war as its chief interest there can , of course , be no war party . But the Crown Prince is mistaken . The splendid devotion the . German people have shown at the call to arms is no proof that the gospel of militarism had been accepted by the whole nation ; it is proof only that there is no sacrifice which they are not glad to make in the service of their country . When the war is over , and not until then , will the German people have an opportunity to think , and to speak their thoughts , on the militarist obsession which is costing them , and all the world , so dear . ADMIRAL MAHAN . Admiral Mahan was not at all a prophet without honor in his own country , yet it is undoubted that his first great fame was won abroad , and that it always remained higher in Europe than at home . The feeling tributes to him by the English press are an indication of the esteem in which he washeld in England . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singular good fortune of being able to interpret English history to Englishmen . They had done great deeds ; he first made them understand the full significance of what they had done . As a piece of philosophical historical writing , his book on Sea Power will long hold its high repute . It meant far more to England than , for example , Motley 's histories did to the Dutch . For Mahan was not merely a delver in the archives and a collector of facts  --  his style was much less brilliant than Motley 's ? but had the insight and the grasp to wrest the core of truth out of the period of which he wrote . This came almost with the force of a revelation to the nation with whose history he was dealing . As Englishmen read his lucid and masterly account of the way in which Nelson was the chief throttler of Napoleon , and saw that their safety had really been secured by the lonely vigils as well as the fighting of British sailors , storm-tossed for years from the Nile to the Baltic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit at the feet of Admiral Mahan as their wisest teacher about these critical events in their past . No such vivid national interest for his own countrymen attached to Admiral Mahan 's writings . This would account for their comparative lack of appreciation , or at least of popularity , here . Nor can it be said that his gifts for narrative or for literary expression were such as to draw the general reader to his works . His style was , indeed , well fitted to the task he set himself . It was clear , though not picturesque , and was of cumulative weight . To get the real impact of his argument you had to have a patience and a comprehensiveness something like his own in marshalling facts and compelling them to yield their true meaning . His conception was original and powerful , but it took time and iteration to work it out . So there is little movement or glow in his pages , though one comes occasionally upon a passage of appealing eloquence . And it is to be observed also that Admiral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his later writings . This is no reproach to a writer who was dealing with such theses as his . An argument may be a very good one even if subtle and deeply pondered . But it is not the kind of argument that takes hold of the popular imagination . Voltaire has something about the " big " books never being the ones to set a nation on fire ; it being always the little books , packed with emotion , aflame with passion , that do the business . Admiral Mahan 's writings , distillguished as they are , influential as they have been , could never be ranked , in this kind of effect , with those of Rousseau or even of Tom Paine . In Admiral Mahan 's later years , after his retirement from active service , he held a unique position and exhibited a strange blending of qualities . He got to be a sort of transcendental apostle of war . In this , we do not doubt , he was perfectly sincere . He was a man of deep religious faith , often prominent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with his naval formulas in a way often to jar upon a sensitive mind . In point of fact , Admiral Mahan was about the nearest type we had to the German glorifiers of war on high and mystic grounds . We do not mean that he was a belligerent or aggressive man ; at heart he loved peace , unquestionably . But somehow his long brooding over the clash of national wills and the enginery of war inclined his mind to see in ships and guns the peculiarly chosen instruments of the Divine purposes . This lent a fervor and an appearance of moral elevation to his arguments for mighty armaments , but could not cover up the " double nature " which he came to exhibit  --  the devout Christian and the eager naval strategist. , Some have spoken of Admiral Mahan 's death as untimely . If we could but have had his critique of the present war , of all the operations of which at sea he was a close student , till his health broke ! He lived long enough , however , to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have been content with the work of the British navy up to the present , but he could have pointed to the fact that it was successfully discharging its old and chief function ? holding the command of the sea , keeping commerce flowing freely to English ports while shutting it off from the enemy 's country , and standing ready to repel any attack on the sea-walls of England . THE BRIGHTER SIDE OF DIPLOMACY . It can not be said that this has been a banner year for diplomacy . As an insurance against war , it has been as ghastly a failure as has invincible armament . If a diplomatic negotiation was ever more shockingly mishandled than that leading up to the European combat , we do not know where to look for its record . With the general outside opinion that the most glaring faults were committed by the German diplomats , many Germans agree  --  at least in private . If the report , a few days ago , from Berlin hadbeen true  --  as , of course , it was not  --  that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were at liberty to seek another career , it would have only expressed , in a heightened way , the feeling which has frequently been intimated in German publications , that Bismarck would never have permitted Germany to go to war against such a combination of great Powers . Nor are those who were in charge of the foreign policy of the other nations to be held blameless . All told , the high function of diplomacy in keeping the peace was miserably discharged . If Coleridge had lived to see the exhibition , he would have put added emphasis into his exclamation , " Your art diplomatic is stuff ! " But there is a brighter side to the story . It is one of which Americans are agreeably reminded by the return home of Ambassador Herrick . What we mean is , of course , the great opportunity which has come to our Ministers and Ambassadors abroad to do humane work , and at once to heighten the prestige of the American diplomatic service and create a feeling of marked respect and friendliness for our country . Mr. Herrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris , at a time of great emergency and confusion , full worthy to be compared with that of Minister Washburn in 1870 . And the private and public testimony which has come across the water in praise of the work of Ambassador Gerard in Berlin , of Penfield in Vienna , of the two Pages , one in London and one in Rome , of - Brand Whitlock in Belgium , of Dr. van Dyke in Holland , and in these last few days of Ambassador Morgenthau in Constantinople , is something in which Americans may legitimately take pride . Diplomacy , after all , must have some life and some grace in it if it is able thus to relieve some of the suffering caused by war and to strengthen international friendships even while the belligerents are tearing at each other 's throats . It is a particular piece of good fortune that American good offices have been put at the disposal of Japan in the course of this war , and that the Japanese Government is duly grateful for what an American Ambassador has been able to do for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times of November 4 devotes an entire article to this subject . It recounts the fact that the Japanese Ambassador in Italy , Baron Hayashi , had telegraphed home an appreciative account of the labors of Mr. Gerard in behalf of Japanese caught by the war in Germany . Those who were detained received friendly oversight , and some were aided to reach Switzerland . At last accounts , it was believed that all the civilian Japanese in German territory had been , through Ambassador Gerard 's friendly and persistent representations to the German Government , permitted to leave the country . Speaking for the Japanese people , the Japan Times declares : " This is a great debt we owe to the United States . " To have been able to render this service to Japan ought to be a peculiar gratification to Americans . Our public relations with Japan have not been marked by the finest delicacy on our part . A polite and sensitive people themselves , the Japanese have often thought they were treated with scant consideration by Americans . This is notoriously true of a portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a degree of our official attitude . The Japanese have given many proofs of their desire to be on friendly terms with us  --  always , to be sure , consistent with their ideas of national dignity . They have often gone out of their way to show special favors to Americans , as when the Mikado recently gave a sum of money ? $25,000 , if we remember  --  to an American hospital in Japan . But such gracious advances have either been on our part rudely received or coolly ignored . We have acted as if the Japanese were only giving us our due , while we were under no obligation to them whatever . And travellers in Japan tell us that this conduct , of which as a nation we have too frequently been guilty , has left its hurt in the Japanese consciousness . All the more significant and welcome , then , is this public service which American diplomacy has been able to do the Japanese . Their grateful thanks should prompt us , on our side , to look to the courtesies of international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case of Japan . The whole record of the work of American diplomats during the past four months ? should help us to a better notion of their duties and of their usefulness . The business is not all ceremony and convention . A human heart beats under the official coat . Nor are we to think of diplomacy as taken up with causes of friction  --  with protests and ultimatums . In the light of what has happened , we can see its possibilities in the service of humanity and in strengthening the ties that bind nations together . It was a great opportunity which the war placed before our Ministers and Ambassadors in Europe , and the manly and spirited way in which they have risen to its full height is something in which we can all take honest satisfaction .
