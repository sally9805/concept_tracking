txt A thrilling story of hardship in an open boat in mid ocean , a tale of heroic toilers of the sea facing the torments of hunger , thirst , bitter cold , and dire peril of winds and waves , was brought to the city to-day by Capt . E. J. Johnston of the American Revenue Cutter Seneca , which rescued the four remaining surviving members of the crew of the Leyland liner Columbian , burned at sea on May 5 . The sufferers were removed to the hospital soon after the arrival of the Seneca . They had been tenderly cared for by Capt . Johnston and the Seneca 's physician . The revised list of the number in the lifeboat showed that there had been fifteen and not sixteen as at first reported . These men subsisted on ship 's biscuits , slr ) e laces , and leather and salt water . The names of the survivors and dead in the last lifeboat , missing from the Columbian , picked up by the Seneca , were as follows : The Survivors . BELANGER , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LUDWIGSEN , MICHAELE , fireman . TIERS , ? , first officer . Those Wno Perished . ANDERSON . HANS , fireman . ANTONIO , G. , fireman , CHRISTIE . 0. , seaman .

TUEL , PETER , seaman . I Chief Officer Tiere , who is an Englishman , only 22 years old , gave the following account of the castaways ' adventures : " I had just got on the Columbian 's bridge at midnight , . May 3 , with no signs whatever of fire on board , when there came a series of explosions . One , I think , was a bunker explosion . It almost rent the ship in two . There were explosions among the cargo , and I think the first explosion was in No. 3 hatch . " We left the Columbian at 2 A. M. on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following a heavy explosion . We had no compass in our boat , as it had been taken out for cleaning . We had matches and a lantern , but there was a strong wind and the spray prevented us from obtaining a light . We kept the Columbian in sight until daylight . The smoke and fire of the ship enabled us to see her until that time . Then the rain began to fall , and we lost sight of the ship . We did not attempt to row or sail , but put out a sea anchor and drifted . " That day a four-funneled steamer passed us about a mile and a half away , but we were unable to make any signal before she was out of sight . The next morning , Tuesday , May 5 , a steamer with a black , red-banded funnel passed us about four miles away , but we could not attract her attention . On the afternoon of the 5th a Cunard liner came within two miles of us and seemed to stop as though picking up something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw no ship until the Seneca picked us up . " For the fourteen days that we were floating about the weather was thick with mist , fog , and rain , but the day we were rescued was bright and clear and the sea smooth . " When we abandoned the Columbian , we had a cask of water and the boat 's bread tank was three-quarters full . I pet the boat 's crew on rations , one bis ? cult and half a cup of water three times a day for each man . When it rained we caught water in the sail , and in that way kept up our supply until we were rescued . The biscuits rapidly ran low . and at the end of the first week the al . lowance was cut down by one-third . Hull the First Man to Die . " On Saturday , May 9 , Oiler George Hull complained that he could not stand short rations of water , and despite all the advice of the boat 's company began drinking sea water . That night he became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We tried to revive him with a little water , but it was too late , and after making sure that he was beyond all help we put his body over the side . and I said what I could remember of the burial service over him . " Then Richmer , a fireman , died about 2 o'clock in the morning of the 12th . Anderson , another fireman , died the next day , and so did the cook , Schrimberger . Gustafsen was the next to die . " All these men went pretty much the same way . They began to drink sea water . and their sufferings were frightful . The more they drank the more they wanted . There was one tin dipper hi the boat , and I tried to keep this in my possession . But if I was asleep they would get It away from me . It was pretty much one continuous nightmare about this time . I would get the dipper away from men who were swilling salt water , but the next minute they would be leaning out over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cows at a brook . Soon they would go crazy . All of them died singing , completely insane . I think it was the salt water more than anything else that killed them . The men who kept to the scanty portion of fresh water stood the exposure better . Margetts , the chief engineer , was the next to die . He perished from exposure . Then one of the worst of all our trials happened . Jakob , a big oiler , a Russian , who stood over 6 feet , started to drink salt water . went insane , and tried to kill the whole boat crew . There were only five of us alive then , and poor Dyckman , the mess boy , was so weak he could not stand . This was about 5 o'clock on Friday night . " I was sleeping when Belanger woke me up and said that Jakob had gone crazy . He was sitting in the boat with an axe and swearing he would go ashore for a drink . I talked to him a bit , coaxed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . I took everything I thought he could use for a weapon away from him , but I had hardly fallen asleep when he got a boat stretcher and came aft , threatening to kill us all . There was nothing for it but to tie him up . Lashed Him to a Thwart . " Jakob was ordinary a very powerful man , about 40 years of age , and Kendal . Belanger , Ludwigsen , and myself had all we could do to handle him . He was screaming at the top of his voice that we were trying to keep his money from him so he could not go on a spree . He shouted out that I had his passbook and would not give him his pay . and he was going to lay for me particularly . We had a pretty hard fight to get him under control . But we finally tied him down in the bottom of the boat and lashed him to a thwart . He lived for five or six hours , screaming at the top of his voice . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips , but it was no use . He had gone . Ir was about 1 o'clock Saturday morning when he died . " It appears that Peter Triel told his boat mates that before . the Columbian sailed for Antwerp he dreamed of being aboard a sinking ship , and then being out at sea in an open boat for fourteen days before being picked up . Triel was constantly complaining that he would not be able to last out the fourteen days and that he would never see Antwerp again . On the morning of the four-1 teenth day he died . Capt . Johnston 's story of the rescue ' follows : " The boat was sighted at 10:05 o'clock Sunday morning about forty miles south southeast of Sable Island . The men in the boat had seen the Seneca for two hours before they were picked up and were pulling to get across the line of her course . The mate was steering and the three poor , emaciated men at the ow s were pulling as hard as their strength would permit . The boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on board . One had to be carried below , two staggered across the deck to the door of the companionway , and the fourth had to be led below . " They were all taken to the sick bay . where the ship 's surgeon , Dr. Slaughter , took charge of them . Each man was stripped of his clothes and stimulants were given to him . A hypodermic injection of strycnn:ne was administered to the weakest . They were all rubbed down with alcohol and put to bed . As soon as their condition warranted , hot soup , a little at a time and at frequent intervals , was fed to them . " All rallied promptly , and in an hour were talking freely . They showed a marked improvement this morning , and undoubtedly all will fully recover . The Columbia 's first officer was wearing heavy sea boots when in the boat and did not cut them . As a result his feet became swollen so that the circulation partially stopped in his feet and gangrene developed in toes of both feet . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The four men were turned over to the local officers to be transferred to the Marine Hospital . " Capt . Johnston said that great credit was due to First Officer Tiere for the manner in which he managed the boat and the men . The rations were well handled , their distribution being so calculated as to make them last as long as possible . ' It was a case of the survival of the fittest , " sa ! d Johnston . " The eleven had to die for the other four to live . "
