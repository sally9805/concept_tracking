WE were Germans before we were Socialists , " retorted an eminent Social Democrat of Germany when taunted with the record his party has made in the last five years . " A long time before , " he might have added ; also , figuratively , " a long distance . " The war has been to the world a series of disillusions , but none of them of sharper or more painful mean-ing than when we saw that all the fine professions of the German Socialists in Favor of peace and universal brotherhood ere soluble at the mere touch of the imperial scepter , waving to war . Indeed , in this case the reality , which most of us have not yet fully grasped , is still worse . When did the war begin ? April , 1913 ; not August , 1914 , as the ress always has it . The real declaration f war was made by the German Reichsag when it struck observing Europe lumb and chill by passing an extraorlinary war credit of $250,000,000 ; and , o that act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eichstag gave practically their support . All men in the world accustomed to ake upon the day 's news an intellient diagnosis must have gasped and tared at this portent . Unless Germany ieliberately planned now to bring down I pon mankind the war her armament ad silently threatened these many years , sere was no good reason for this perilous Aber-rattling ; certainly none appeared a the state of Europe . Yet the Socials seemed to be for it ; that was the , tt comprehensible fact . August Bebel , en still active , was the ablest and most imous of their leaders , and criticism iom many lands seemed to goad him to a defense . It was of a nature to Lill the last hope in any friend of peace . , wo reasons he gave for the Reichstag 's action . One was that President Poincare of France , who had been but newly elected , was a war-like and dangerous man and no one could tell to what lengths he might go . The other was that in the Balkan wars the Turks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Serbians , taught by French . The judicious might grieve indeed when they came upon such an offering from such a source , and anybody able to read might see that war was close at hand . The world had long looked upon the German Socialists as one of its safeguards . It had been told that even if the War Lord should command to battle the Socialists would not abate one jot of their faith , and affecting pictures were drawn of the typical German Socialist folding his arms and allowing himself to be shot rather than obey his Kaiser and go forth to shoot his brother proletarians . Four millions was the strength of the German Socialist party ; all opposed to war and ready to refuse to engage in it . How then could Germany ever break the peace ? Let her drill her great armies as she might list , delight her rulers with her far-famed autumn maneuvers , and make the welkin and other things ring about the Mailed Fist . The Social Democrats were the sufficient answer to all that . And now it appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as but fantasy . Now it appeared that when a band of jingoes went to and fro beating the war drum the Socialists were as much entranced with the rub-a-dub as any school-boy of them all . Either so or they were sand-blind to what other men could see very plainly , even men farther from the stage and not directly concerned in the play there . Many good men in Switzerland , for instance , knew perfectly well what was going on . They did not need an apostolic revelation to understand that nations do not adopt extraordinary war credits of ) 250,000,000 to expend the money on Sunday-schools . These excellent men , in reasonable alarm , started out to se if the world 's peace might not still be kept . We ought not to overlook now what the historian will probably regard as the most significant event of the whole war prologue . The Swiss invited the radical members of the French Chamber of Deputies and of the German Reichstag , Socialists and advanced liberals , to come to Berne for a friendly , informal conference that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coming storm . It was a kindly and might have been a serviceable thought , but it came to nothing for only one reason that the Swiss had overlooked . They believed that radicals everywhere were opposed to war and ready to take any steps to prevent it . In this they seemed to have made no error about the French radicals , who came to Berne in a body , and seemed but too glad to come . But when they arrived they found they had only themselves to talk to ; the German radicals largely failed to respond . Some minds , I understand , are still able to cling to the notion that in those days of fate the German Socialists were the innocent dupes of a wicked , designing Government in which they had placed a beautiful and child-like faith . The suggestion that the skilful Bebel and the adroit Scheidemann not once suspected war to mean war , could never appeal powerfully , I should imagine , to the adult mind ; hut , anyway , the story of the collapse of the Berne conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one of many incidents that will never fit with any theory that the Socialists did nor know what they were doing . I spent the summer of 1913 in France , Germany , and Austria , and the storm signals were flying so plainly that even the eye of an alien visitor could hardly mistake them . A large part of the German press , flagrantly led by the journals that supported the Pan-Germanic League , was engaged in trying to arouse in the German people a virulent hatred of France . The thing was as open as day ; the campaign was deliberate and unmistakable ; and any one that read at all could not escape it . A part of this vicious effort was a series of fantastic tales of outrage , insult , and injury alleged to have been suffered by Germans that ventured unattended upon French soil . It was to be noted that all these events were staged in French towns along the eastern part of the frontier , a fact that I have since pondered as not likely to have been accidental . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although the press described events certainly calling for action by the Government of the victim , Berlin turned not a hand in any of these matters . The most famous and successful of the narratives was the weird tale of Ham Miiller . This was said to be a pool German boy who enlisted in the Frencl Foreign Legion and merely because of hi : nationality was horribly tortured an maltreated until at last he had bees beaten into a dying condition and left ti rot upon the desert . The fire-eating par of the German press dwelt upon all thi with infinite detail ; one , I remember going to the length of a picture of th body of poor Hans abandoned to th vultures . A furious demand went up fo an official apology and reparation fror France . The wilder among the journal were all for an ultimatum from German that France disband her Foreign Legior the German ambassador to ask for hi passports within twenty-four hours the demand were not complied witl This , of course , would be equivalent t a declaration of war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competent authority an shown to be a web of falsehoods . Thei had been no Hans Muller in the Forei Legion ; no member of it , whether Gel man or other , had been persecuted abused ; none had been left-dying on tf desert . Journalism has not know balder inventions or more wicked ; tlwhole thing must have been the work wholly depraved minds , for it migl easily have brought about a war . All the other stories in this categoi made a similar record . It was proved ' r patient investigation that no GermE woman had been persecuted at Lun villc ; that no German traveler had bet beaten at Verdun ; that no German traveling salesmen had been mobbed at Nancy . Yet the fire-eating press ignored all these demonstrations and continued to print and refer to the canards as if they were things veritable and established . What was still more alarming was the course of the Socialist journals . It was to have been expected , most assuredly , that they at least would perceive the danger of such incendiary utterances and strive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of them did so , or that Socialists as individuals were interesting themselves on : he side of sanity and safety , even after : he jingo fabrications had been stripped iare and riddled . These were ugly signs , and , coupled with the incessant beating of the tocsin iv the League , might well fill with disnay and forebodings every friend of ieace . The attitude of the Socialists and their press seemed so inexplicable hat when I returned home I addressed o one of the most distinguished and air-minded of the German Socialists a cries of inquiries on the subject . With lie prolegomena appropriate to his posiion , I asked him to explain , if he would e so good , the course of the Socialists the Reichstag ; why they had refused r neglected to attend the Berne con:rence ; why they had made no effort ) combat the war-drum campaign of the league press ; why the Socialist journals ad not printed the truth about the tans Midler fabrication ; why they had at overwhelmed the war-makers with ie facts about the Luneville story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarming situation created by these fables had not been denounced by Le Socialist organizations . These iniiries were sent through an intimate lend of the Socialist leader . I never ceived a reply . When the war broke out the civilized Jrld was amazed at the speetaeleoffered the German Socialists , ardent in the port of their Government in a wanton d wicked assault upon a small coon ? then at peace with Germany . Noth ; more repugnant to the announced inciples of Socialism could be imagined an the brigandage Germany practised on Belgium ; and German Socialists not only acquiesced in it , they took a hand in it . Instead of the beautiful martyrdom in the cause of peace and brotherhood that we had been promised , German Socialists , apparently with great good-will , seized arms and went forth to shoot their Socialist comrades of Belgium and France . Not all of them did this , of course ; we are not to forget the example of Liehknecht and his handful of followers ; but in these cases the world can deal only with averages , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more hostility to the war than the veriest Junker . Some of them attempted to take shelter in an ingenious but unsubstantial plea that an inexorable necessity drove them to the firing-line . Civilization , they said , was in danger from Russian barbarism . Germany was about fo be overrun by Russian hordes . German kultur , the real hope of the world , was in peril of annihilation . Russia , envious of German success , prosperity , and superior intelligence , was about to descend with its vast , ignorant millions upon a defenseless Fatherland . Under these conditions their duty was to fight . The cause of Socialism , as of the world 's intellectual welfare , demanded that the invasion be stopped ; that the Russians , standing now with boots uplifted to trample out this benign light , should be driven back . So to drive them back and rescue kultur from the threatened destruction by the savage north , Germany marched due south , invaded Belgium , and made its historic lunge at Paris . It never seemed to occur to these acute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it looked upon this performance . The horrors of Aerschot and Herve seemed to outsiders an extremely faulty answer to the alleged threat of Russia . Moreover , to those that knew the inside of the European game the excuse seemed from the first no better than a grim jest . Whatever the two Governments might pretend for gallery effect , the real Russia and the real Germany were always one in sympathy ; the Kaiser was always the Czar 's dearest friend . The negotiations for a separate peace , cut short by the Russian Revolution , were the expression of the actual sentiments of two sovereigns far too much interested in upholding the monarchical principle to be committed to the " crushing " of any of its powerful exponents . It was not the Russian hordes that the Kaiser feared ; it was the rising tide of democracy in the world , threatening to put out of business the last of the kings . But , aside from all this , something occurred two and a half years later that caused this plea of the German Socialists to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arose , threw off the blight of autocracy , and founded the Russian democracy the first and imperative duty of the German Socialists , if they were sincere , was to hail the new order with rejoicing and absolutely to refuse to fight against it . For this there were unassailable reasons . The Russian Revolution was a great political upheaval and more ; it was a great Socialist triumph . Almost all the Russian Revolutionists were Socialists ; they adopted the Socialist red flag as the national ensign of new Russia , they organized the first Socialist government in the world . The German Socialists were condemned out of their own mouths . If civilization could be in any danger from such Russians the whole Socialist theory was a menace . If the Socialist theory were right , then the German Socialists should be fighting on the side of new Russia , not against it . In truth the last ground had been cut from under them . They had always professed ardent admiration for political democracy . Here was a people that had won out of tyranny tolreedom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive them back to servitude . Here was flying at last the red flag , the symbol of the Socialist faith , the colors of the international brotherhood . The German Socialists had always professed the utmost devoticin to that flag . They now appeared in the act of making war upon it , of tearing it down that it might be supplanted with the old flag of capitalistic despotism . Before a movement could endure an inconsistency so monstrous as this the world would have to lose all sense of the congruous and the just . The truth then appears that the German people , under the inspiration and example of their Government , had eaten of the insane root of world empire , and Socialism was no more of a protection against that poison than was Conservatism . A long period of success and unexampled development had turned the German head . The Day , toasted by twenty years of German officers , had come at last ; a wild , alluring dream of destiny to be fulfilled seized the minds of millions , Socialists and others . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tt the precepts of German heroes fron Frederick the Great to Bismarck , but m human being can ever reconcile it witl the cornerstone of Socialism or witl the teachings of two generations of ad mired Socialist sages , mostly of German birth . The great idea of the extreme doctrinaire or Marxian Socialists wa always that the members of the pro letariat of all lands owed allegiance an ' loyalty to their class above any countr : or " capitalistic " form of government " Workers of the world , unite ! " was thei incessant slogan . He loyal to you class . They preached what they calle the class war while they solemnly e ) . horted against all other kinds of wai fare . Whatever the plea might be , a wars between nations were made b and for the sole benefit of the exploitin or capitalist class . Fight everywhei against that class and for your owl do not think of fighting for your countr : It means nothing to you ; your cla : means everything . But now it was demonstrated that t first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time the issue was real raised whether Socialists should go wi their country or go with their class , tilt forgot all about both class and revert doctrine and went with their countr And these were the Socialists of whor in accordance with their pretensions , tl most had been expected ! If the doctrb of class loyalty would not work wi them would it work at all ? Was it n sufficiently shown , for this age al probably for ages to conic , as no me than an agreeable dream ? Men h not , after all , been remade ; the pc derous volumes of Das Kapital had n changed their essential impulses . T old instinct of loyalty to the soil whereone was born could not with a few elegant phrases be eliminated from the human heart . It must be so , for if any Socialists could be thought to he emancipated from the nationalistic feeling and at the same time sophisticated about the adroit manipulation of that feeling it was surely the German Socialists , who had the advantage of so much practical experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field . And yet what they called the " capitalistic " press of their country , and the worst /art of that press , had but to call to : hem with some faked-up stories of in- mit and some cheap appeals to patriot- sm and they turned Chauvinists like the - est ! I am not , however , interested in inlicting the German Socialists , but in rying to estimate what will be the effect if all this upon the Socialist movement , f the world . Before the war the organted part of that movement was dom-iated by Germans and German influnce . That kind of domination will ever be possible again . In the old days he German Socialists used to bring to le triennial International Socialist Conress a spirit of prideful arrogance that ther delegates often found extremely ' digestible . The Germans usually made lain , and without excessive suavity , their iew of the movement , which was that of roprietorship . Representation in the ongress is on the basis of the number Socialist votes cast at the last preccdg national election . This gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illions of votes and won all these seats the Reichstag , a great numerical adintage and the authority of success . Another reason for their masterful i titude was their impression that icialism was a product of the Fathered , a thing " made in Germany , " like brand of cutlery or half hose . Karl arx was a German Jew ; most of the linens writers on Socialism had been rmaris ; the rest of the Socialist world is peopled with novices and persons in pilage who it was quite preposterous think were capable of any real acaintance with the arcana of the ence . The Germans at the Congress ally had their way about everything . view of the facts mentioned in the foregoing pages it is clear enough that hereafter , if there continues to be any organized international movement , they will be in a very different position in i regard to it . This is to say nothing of another and obvious influence that will be at work to quiet them , provided , as before , there is any such organization aswe is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the war is over all the existing animosities will be as if they had never been , and delegates from all nations will meet together in oblivious harmony . This may be right , but an incredulous world will have to be shown about it . Moreover , while there may he English Socialists that will take the chance of sitting at an Inter-national Congress by the side of a man that pointed a rifle at the heart of Edith Cavell , and French Socialists wil mg to go cheek by jowl with apologists for what happened at Senlis and Lille , something else is to be reckoned with , and that is the feelings of the rank and file of the workers in England and France . What the rank and file of English workers think about a show of tender amity and warm regard for Germany they have made fairly well known , and the chance is small that their views will change much in this generation ; Ger-man air raiders and submarines have attended to all that . But the most important phase of the matter still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is supposed to be through the conversion of the proletariat . The small chance it will have with the English proletariat if English Socialists meet on terms of cordiality with the men that killed Captain Fryatt , let us say , while the German Socialists continue their ardent support of German autocracy , is apparent . We are to remember that almost every other nation that has been at war with Germany has cases like that of Captain Fryatt . It is contrary to human nature that these things should be wiped in an instant and as with a sponge from the memories of men . No International Socialist Congress has been held since Copenhagen , 1910 . One was due at Vienna , in 1913 , but the Viennese , because of local difficulties , asked for a year 's postponement , and then the war broke out a few days before the Congress was to assemble . It is planned to call a Congress as soon as peace may be declared . Delegates , no doubt , will be sent from many countries , but the hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old conditions restored is manifestly a dream . It is not alone that men do not so readily forget , nor that in the supreme crisis of the movement the German Socialists turned against the faith they had embraced . Besides these dividing influences the war has revealed two irreconcilable conceptions of Socialist theory and activities . I think something of the kind was indicated even before the war ; at the Stuttgart Congress of 1907 , for instance , in the sharp clash between the Germans on one side and the French and Italians on the other . Heedful men might have seen even then that racial differences so vital would be likely to show with more emphasis on a greater occasion . The French and Italians appeared with an idealistic conception of Socialism ; the Germans with one wholly materialistic . These things will not cohere . The Germans have always looked upon Socialism from the point of view of the stomach . It was a thing to fill bellies , not to gratify the yearnings of the race for freedom and intellectual expansion . Any view but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sourly frowned upon . But this , of course , brings us once more against the old rock of national or racial instinct . Socialism can advance in the world only by winning the support at the polls of peoples that have at least some measure of electoral freedom . Such people will not be won by what is inherently repugnant to them , and a theory of bald materialism without a touch of the ideal will never appeal much to Frenchmen , Italians , or Americans . There must be more involved than plenty of Wienerwurst . This is one reason why Socialism has made so little progress in this country . It has been presented to the American voter always in its uncouth German garb , and he has not cared for it in that attire and never will . We are to remember , further , that the war is exceedingly likely to bring about a great spiritual uprising in the world ; if it does not , indeed , it will have been fought largely in vain . The idea ! , which is the only real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts than ever before It is unlikely that the German Socialist will abandon a conception to which they have been so thoroughly committed anc one so consonant with national instincts but if they do not the greater part o. the Socialist movement of the world wil probably take its way without mud regard to them , whether here or abroad The war has taught some other les sons , or should have taught them , to those capable of being instructed . On , is that this world can not be remade in : minute . There are now neither trum pets nor soap-box orators , however ex pert in vocalism , that can in an instan blow down the walls of Jericho . Th New Day for which Socialists look wil not arrive with a bound , but come as th product of evolution and changing con ditions . To preach the impossible vies of the Socialist doctrine merely discredit what is sound . The generality of men i much too sane to believe that th American people , let us say , will arise ( a morning , overturn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have di co-operative commonwealth swingin harmoniously down the ringing groove of time . These things do not happei In former days when one had a glimp ; of this truth the custom was to assn ; him that the tactic was good because E demanding a great deal we achieved part . " By demanding revolution we g , reform , " Keir Hardie was wont to It does not now appear so . In this coui try , at least , by talking mirage yri merely waste time . The war has shown that neither th. nor that other once favorite Social method of kicking everybody in.the fa is the best way . Americans will n rapturously welcome the idea that must quarrel with every man that owi more than one shirt . If they go into ti subject at all , they are usually too wi to believe that all men that have mon are thieves and all that have not a angels . They will freely admit that t existing system works great injusti and ought to be changed , but the not see how it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are also oftentimes its victims . Heretofore we have had in the United States this most singular condition of a larger Socialist sentiment than exists in any other country and a smaller representation of it in the recognized Socialist movement . With the essentials of Socialism almost everybody in the United States , aside from our near-aristocrats , is in sympathy . The charge involved may not be designated to them by any Socialist label , but they are of its faith nevertheless . Most men that accepted the idea shied from any connection with i the Socialist organization because in its methods and make-up it seemed alien , fanatical , and unworkable on this soil . You can never get very far in this country with a political party whose memi bers call one another " comrade , " are bound by iron-clad regulations to surrender their judgment at the polls to a committee of gentlemen with unpronounceable names and a tangled dialect , and observe a sign-manual after the manner of a secret society . The American voter does not understand these things , never will , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move-Inent in the United States has been 3erman made and adjusted to the Gernan psychology . The war made the inal showing of this fact when it rerealed a majority of the American socialist party as preferring the cause of 3ermany to the survival of Socialism in kussia . Like their eminent leader , they ' Mere Germans before they were Social ; ts ? or anything else . It would be tisurdto suppose that Americans , aware f the American psychology and Amer .. : an conditions , could work again with n element whose loyalty to the country f their origin went beyond all loyalty to tie country they had sworn to support much as it went beyond their devoon to Socialist principles . The Interttional Socialist organization will be eered whither the men in charge of it ay direct ; it will no longer express the icialist movement . When we rememr that two months of the war moved : tat Britain farther and faster to eialism than forty years of argument d disquisition had moved it , the utility VOL . CXXXVI. ? No. 814. - 72of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem . impressive . Great changes are impending when the war shall end , the greatest the world has known and the most valuable to its peace and happiness , but the organized efforts of theorists and long-distance disputants will probably have little to do with these transformations . Here in the United States.the Socialist machine takes on some temporary bulk and makes some additional noise because of passing sympathy with it from extreme pro-Germans and from pacifists in whom the faculty of co-ordination is lacking ; but these are but spasmodic manifestations and without significance . Probably few of the pro-Germans , brewers , and afflicted pacifists that have joined themselves this last year to the American Socialist party have the least knowledge of or interest in the principles of Socialism ; probably many of them would be horribly shocked at the slightest likelihood of the success of those principles . German sympathies and pacifism run mad have made strange bedfellows ; also the pro-German feeling has driven many indoctrinated Socialists far from the ancient moorings . A cardinal article of faith with these used to be that the Socialists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Socialist creed . It is in fact , but another illustration of the rather disconcerting discovery with which I started . The old racial or nationalistic instinct is stronger than we had fondly believed . The wing of the Socialist party that has taken a position against the Government in the war is chiefly of German or Jewish origin , and with many Jews the inborn feeling of hatred against Russia seems to be unconquerable even when the hideous old Russian autocracy has fallen before new-born democracy . In such conditions , a philosophical view of the future of Socialism in the United States is that it will be a progress in fact but not in name . Many of the fundamental things contended for by the Socialists will come now by evolution and changed conditions . The Utopia may still be far off , but by different designations the practical essence of the Socialistic doctrine can not be averted . These changes will probably be with as little reference to organizations as to him of the soap-box . If a party that in a time of war and national emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be much of a factor in the political field the American voter would have to be remade , and the Socialist party of the United States was sufficiently handicapped even before its recent adventures in dis-loyalty . This country has had no monopoly of the disillusion process . The same thing has been at work abroad . Even the German party is now hopelessly split . In Great Britain , H. M. Hyndman , the veteran and pioneer of the British Socialist movement , for many years its ablest champion , has withdrawn from the regular organization and formed a new association similar in purpose to the new Socialist union in America . In Great Britain , as here , it was the war that precipitated the division . Mr. Hyndman and his friends took the position that the war had been forced upon the world by Germany , that the real issue was between autocracy and democracy , that if autocracy should win the very foundations of Socialist hope would he swept away , that without democracy Socialism would be impossible and unthinkable , and that as autocracy made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to democracy 's defense . The element in Great Britain that does not sympathize with him has made no good answer to these propositions . It seems to have cast out the Hyndman thesis merely on the general principle that war is to be opposed no matter how it comes about , for what ideal of freedom or defense it may be waged , or what may be the consequences of victory on one side or the other . There are optimists , of course , that think this split may be healed , but the hope is probably baseless . It is also immaterial . In Great Britain as in America and some other countries the attempt to found a kind of Socialist sect , bitter of countenance and fanatical of creed , was always a failure and always would be . A wall of alien methods long blocked the progress of social reform . The war has broken a way through it and indicated industrial democracy as a nearly attainable goal . Some persons , undoubtedly , will continue to try to pass through the wall by butting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure and unattractive to men not so much interested in ortho. doxy as in results .
