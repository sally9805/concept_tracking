txt Somebody blundered . Worse than the order that sent the Light Brigade into the jaws of death , worse in its ' effect than the Black Hole of Calcutta , was the order that trained the machine guns of the State Militia of Colorado upon the strikers ' camp of Ludlow , burned its tents , and suffocated to death the scores of women and children who had taken refuge in the rifle-pits and trenches . . Law and order in Colorado must be preserved . The strike organizers who invaded the camps of the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company with threats and ? arms , to force nine-tenths of its contented workers to unionize , may not escape their fulLmeasure of blame for the labor war that is now on . But no situation can justify the acts of a militia that compels women and babes to lie in ditches and cellars twentyfour hours without food or water , exposes them to cannon and rifle fire , and lets them die like trapped animals ' in the flames of their camp . The State of Colorado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order in the mines . In the recent and continuing labor conflicts M England , Germany , France , and South Africa the Government authorities have worked with strength and firmness to quell disturbances . I From the first the acts of the authorities of Colorado have served only to make confusion worse confounded . Mr .. JonN D. ROCKEFELLER , Jr. , in his statement before the House Committee in Washington , that " a strike has " been imposed upon the company " from outside " to intimidate an army of peaceful miners , declared that the " local authorities in Colorado have " not been able to provide adequate protection for the employes of the " Colorado Fuel and Iron Company . " Therefore it became the first duty of the compa.iy to provide such protection . But it was not the disciplined forces of a private company , it was the crazily officered troops of the State that made the Ludlow camp horror possible . This terrible blunder has precipitated a situation more grave than that which exists between this country and Mexico . Here is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in Colorado , now breaking out with the utmost virulence because of a grievous wrong committed . Gov . AMMON has been asked to convene the Colorado Legislature In special session to shape the policy of the State . Hitherto the labor interests have not been ashamed nor afraid to introduce laws preventing railways from transporting " sti ; ike-breakers . " They were solicitous , often bold in their demands . Solicitude and boldness will now change to defiance and insistence . Pointing to Ludlow , they will justify the legalizing of any act of usurpation . Their doctrine is to deny the right of any man to work for whom he pleases , and they have sought to undermine the law that protects every citizen in rights equal for all . They are now nerved to take this citadel by storm . The right to work becomes in their eyes the right to prevent others from working . In defense of that right they have used bombs , firearms , even artillery , and against sleeping enemies of any sex or age . But when a sovereign State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the anarchy that ensues ?
