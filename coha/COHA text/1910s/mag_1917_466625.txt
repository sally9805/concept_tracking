the same principles as a bird ; it has the same flying capabilities as a bird , and precisely the same limitations . The best flyer among birds is the humming-bird . Have you ever noticed how it poises itself in the air , in almost identically the same place , perhaps for an hour at a time ? The humming-bird is one of the smallest of birds ; and certain insects , which are much smaller , such as the dragon-fly , are also wonderful flyers . It is a law of nature that , the larger the bird , the poorer its flying ability . The barnyard fowl has great difficulty in getting over a fence , while the ostrich does not fly at all . All creatures that live in the air are small ; we have nothing . among flying animals , which can be compared in size to the horse or the elephant . There are excellent mechanical reasons for this . The main one is that , as a bird increases in size , its weight increases at a much greater rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bird doubles in size , it would need , to lift itself in the air , not twice as much power , but eight times as much . That is , its weight increases as its cube , whereas the area of the wings increases as its square . You can easily see where that mathematical principle will soon land you . This is the principle that limits the size of birds , and it is also the principle that limits the size of aeroplanes , which fly just as birds fly . Each increase in size demands a much greater proportional increase in motive power , the result being that we have to add so enormously to the weight that the aeroplane soon reaches a size where it can not leave the ground . Many attempts have been made to make bigger machines , but nothing is gained in economy or usefulness by making them . The aeroplane is a method of transportation that works best and least expensively in small units . We can get better and cheaper service out of two aeroplanes of moderate size than we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are other factors that will limit our present aeroplane practically to its present size , but it is unnecessary to go into the matter in greater detail . Ten passengers have already been carried comfortably , yet it is a fact that a large car carrying ten passengers would not be soeconomicalorefficient as ten little cars each carrying one . " " Most people believe , " I suggested , " that what mainly stands in the way of the aeroplane is its danger . The average citizen regards it as an exhilarating and exciting sport , but not safe enough for general use . " " Yes , " said Mr. Wright , " it is a new idea that the aeroplane is a safe means of transportation in safe hands , yet it is an idea that we must firmly get into the popular mind . The average citizen is still frightened at the prospect of leaving the ground and having no support except the air itself . Yet at the speed which we expect an aeroplane to maintain ? seventy or eighty miles an hour ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The obstructions that cause accidents with trains and automobiles do not exist for flying craft . A locomotive has to follow a definite track , which may he obstructed or the slightest dislocation of which may cause a frightful calamity . The aeroplane is not so circumscribed ? its tracks are wherever it wishes to go . There are no obstructions in the air unlesswe regard ' air-pockets ' as such ? no bridges tocross , no mountains to penetrate , no signals to run by , and no switches to be misplaced . Or compare this new craft to the rough road of the automobile . The slightest mistake or even inattention on the part of the driver , going , say , forty or fifty miles an hour , may hurl the machine over a precipice or overturn it on an embankment . But such a lapse on the part of an aviator has no such deplorable results ; there are no precipices to fall from and no obstructions to collide with . The aeroplane is even safer than some forms of water travel . The motor-boat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even slower , is a more risky form of transportation than an aeroplane . If such a boat strike even a small obstruction , such as a floating plank , its side is punctured and it sinks in a few seconds . But there are no such dangers in the air . " Certain performers have done much to instil this notion that flying is exceedingly dangerous , " Mr. Wright continued . ' These are the daredevil exhibition flyers , who cultivate the circus aspects of the art . Both by words and deeds they have associated the aeroplane with the idea of danger . They have spread abroad the impression that only an immense amount of nerve , abnormal skill , and plenty of luck qualify one for aviation . And their air acrobatics ? their tail-glides and their loopings-the-loop ? have accent u a te d this idea . They have had many bad accidents , too , which have been the necessary consequences of inexperience and of taking foolish chances . Yet I do not wish to criticize too harshly these circus:performers , for they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solid contribution to the cause of aeronautics , for he demonstrated the wonderful stability and righting-power of the aeroplane . He showed that the contrivance could get into practically no position in the air from which it could not be righted . What other means of transportation , except the aeroplane , sails just as well upside as down ? In what other can one turn turtle , without fear of serious consequences ? We owe the demonstration of these reassuring facts to the exhibition-performers , and the discovery has the greatest value for the man or woman who prefers to fly in more prosaic fashion . It gives them a consciousness that , whatever happens , they are safe . Still these flyers , with their numerous accidents , have made the aviator 's career seem a hazardous one , and of this false idea we should disabuse our minds . There is no sense of dizziness in the air . Once well up , you never know whether your elevation is a few hundred or a few thousand feet . " " Are there , then , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , " Mr. Wright answered , " hut there are no difficulties which ordinary prudence and common sense can not provide against , for the greatest danger of acroplaning is not the flying , but the landing . If one has a wide , smooth , open place for his descent , all is well ; but it is inconvenient and it may be fatal to land in the top of a tree or somewhere in the neighborhood of a skyscraper . Of actual upsetting in the air ? that is , a genuine fall , such as was not infrequent in the early days ? there is now very little danger , and there is no reason why accidents of this kind should ever take place , for , as 1 have already said , an aeroplane , no matter what position it gets into , is easily righted . What we must guard against , above everything , is flying too near the ground . Here again we must revise the popular attitude toward the aeroplane . Most people feel that they would not mind going up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the idea of ascending fifteen hundred or two thousand is what appals them . But in general I may say that the higher one flies the safer he is . Clearly , if you are going to fall , you will suffer no more by falling from a thousand feet than from five hundred ; the chances are that you will be killed in either case . But you are less likely to have a serious fall at the higher altitude than at the lower . The reason is that , if the machine is high enough , the pilot has space in which to right himself , while if he is too near the ground he does not have sufficient space . " We also hear much about the stopping of the motor . The public has the impression that this dead motor is one of the greatest perils of flying . As a matter of fact , the stopping of the motor is not necessarily a serious matter . The motor does not make the aeroplane fly ? it merely propels it . The machine flies when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane . Whenever this happens , it glides easily and gracefully toward the earth . Ifwe have a level landing-place under us , everything goes well ; if we do not , the consequences are unpleasant . If we are only a hundred feet in the air , we have n't time.to select a landing-place , but go down just where we are , whether it is a deep pond , a mass of telegraph wires , or the tangled roofs of the city . If we are up a thousand or more feet , however , we have much more room to glide in , and can usually select some place where we can land in comfort . The usual gliding range is about eight to one ; that is , if the aeroplane is a hundred feet in the air , it lands about eight hundred feet away from the place where the motor stops , while if it is up a thousand feet , it comes down about eight thousand feet away , or about a mile and a half . A height of two thousand feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe for all purposes , as , from this height , the flyer can discover a level spot within that large radius . Thus safety in the air is almost entirely a matter of maintaining a siifficient height . Exhibition-performers constantly take this risk ; they persist in flying low over a city , taking their chances that the motor will not stop . I can not understand why men will run such risks , unless it is that flight itself is so easy . and the aeroplane inspires such confidence , that the possibility of a mishap vanishes from the mind . " " What do you do , then , when the motor stops ? " I asked . " The stopping of the motor is not in itself dangerous , " said 11 , Ir . Wright ; " it merely means a descent to earth until the mechanism can be again made ready for flight . But it is inconvenient , and a deterrent to commercial aeroplaning . A motor that works with the same perfection as the automobile motor is to-day our greatest need . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will he remembered , was the greatest problem of the automobile in the early days ? the motor 's constant tendency to break down in a distant road was a constant irritation . We have been going through this same preliminary stage with the aeroplane motor ; indeed , I think we have made more progress in the same period of time in propelling the flying-machine than we did in propelling the automobile . American manufacturers are somewhat behind Europeans in making motors , simply because we have not had the opportunities to experiment . Making thousands of machines for war purposes , the European manufacturers have naturally producedmotors that are superior to ours . They have spent millions in experimental work and with satisfactory results . One motor in particular weighs only 374 pounds , has developed iso horse-power , and has the important quality of durability . This motor has given certain war aeroplanes a speed of 125 miles an hour , and with it the aviator can climb io , 000 feet in ten minutes . The Allies have placed orders for 7,000 of these machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are producing better types every day . The time has therefore arrived for the general use of the aeroplane for commercial and pleasure purposes . " " What , then , will be its uses ? Will it carry passengers to any extent ? " " Yes . It will not , as I have said , supplant the railroad , but there are certain things that the aeroplane can do better than the railroad . It will he demanded whenever the necessity is for great speed . Few express trains average more than fifty miles an hour ? though they make greater speed on short stretches of straight track whereas that speed represents almost the minimum of the flying-machine . We think nothing of sixty and seventy miles , a regulation speed of one hundred miles may be expected , and , as said above , certain pursuit aeroplanes now used in the war go at the rate of one hundred and twenty-five miles an hour . At first even the suggestion of such speeds almost takes one 's breath away ; it seems inconceivable that human beings could physically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference in traveling in the air and on the surface . On a railroad car we are always conscious of high speed ; well up in the air we are not conscious of it at all . The sensation is precisely the same whether you are going forty or ninety miles an hour , or , indeed , if you are making no progress at all , as , in a high adverse wind , sometimes happens . A fly in a Pullman car has the same sensation , whether the car is standing still or rushing ahead at the rate of fifty miles an hour ? the fly is simply carried along with the mass of air and has no sense of motion . The situation is the same in flying . A speed of one hundred miles an hour , therefore , causes no physical distress . Traveling under such circumstances will be far pleasanter than that furnished by the most luxurious Pullman or automobile . There is no roadbed to jar , and we never know when we are going around a curve . Indeed , the passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How will this cut down the time of traveling ? " The trip from New York to Boston , " Mr. Wright answered , " would take about two hours , where now it takes five . From New York to Chicago will take eight or ten hours instead of twenty , as at present . You will be able to make the trip from New York to San Francisco in a couple of days . Now plenty of occasions arise in everyday life when such rapid transit is desirable . The only recourse now for unusually rapid speed is the special train . This has two disadvantages it costs so much that only railroad presidents and millionaires can use it , and , after all , it does not go very much faster than the regular train . In a very few years , I think , the flying-machine will do all the work that the special train does now . It is not only faster , but it is more cornfin-table , much safer , and much less expensive . The New York business man who wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few hours will perhaps mean a successful business deal involving millions , will use the aeroplane . So will the man who wishes to reach the bedside of a sick relative , where saving an hour or two may mean seeing his wife or child alive . We frequently read of surgeons being rushed upon a special train , so that they may arrive in time to perform an operation that may save a human life . What a godsend the speedier transit of a flying-machine will be in cases like this ! " " Why is n't such a service established at once ? " The question was a natural one . " Chiefly because of the impediment I have mentioned ? the scarcity of good landing-places . It will be necessary to establish such landing-placesthat is , smooth level fields at all im-portant points . We have two or three such model landing-places already especially those at Dayton and at Detroit . All large cities will have to build such accommodations ; future municipal planning will necessarily provide them . With these established in all important points , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplement the regular railroad in numerous ways . In particular it will make missing the train ' much less of a calamity than it is now . Suppose , for example , you fail to catch the Twentieth Century Limited at the Grand Central Station ; you can jump into an aeroplane and reach Albany in plenty of time to catch it there . Perhaps the greatest service of the passenger aeroplane is that it will make accessible parts of the world that are now little used . There are plenty of places where railroads can not be built because of the great cost , because of engineering obstacles , and because there is nut enough traffic to justify them . " This brings me to the use of the aeroplane for transporting freight . The present type of machine will never supplant the freight-car , and I can not foresee that it will ever be used for carrying coal or wheat . But in transporting special small packages , precious freight , it will be extremely useful . Here again we shall penetrate sections where the railroad can not carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West , in South America , in Africa . The aeroplane will probably be one of the most potent agencies in the development of Alaska , for here we have an extremely rich country where railroads are difficult and extremely expensive to build . I can best illustrate this by a special instance . There is a certain port in Alaska hack of which , about sixteen miles away , lie rich gold-fields . The problem of the company which works these mines is to get supplies to its men and to get the concentrate hack to tide-water . The mines are shut off from the port by two ranges of mountains four thousand feet high , and it is inconceivable that a railroad should ever be built across these obstructions . Supplies are now sent by a circuitous route which takes three days to make in the summer-time ; in winter it can not be made at all . The company is now completing plans to install an aeroplane service . In this way the workmen can easily sail over the mountainous harriers and reach the miners in an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring hack the concentrate . The money saved will be an important item ; the great point , however , is that the mines , with all their Viii . CXXXIV. ? No. 803. - 78precious output , can be successfully worked for the first time . There are thousands of places , in Alaska and elsewhere , where precisely the same situation exists . In such places the flying-machine will perform much work now done by packhorse and mule , and open up sections where even the mule is useless for transit purposes . One of the greatest obstacles to transportation in Alaska are certain large areas of ' nigger - heads ' ? flat stretches resembling swamps , with a growth similar to cabbage-heads , which neither man nor beast can negotiate , and across which neither railroads nor highways can be built . These obstructions , of course , will present no difficulty to the aeroplane . " " Will the aeroplane be useful for carrying mails ? " " Not to the extent that some people suppose , " said Mr. Wright . " I do not think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it will be too expensive . It would take a very large number of flying-machines , perhaps a hundred , to carry as much mail as we now get into a mail-car . You can easily figure how this would increase the expense . It will have the same advantage in carrying mails as in carrying passengers , and that is speed . This statement also needs some qualification , for , when it comes to quick communication , the aeroplane can never supplant the telegraph and the telephone . But we shall probably have a special rapid mail service by aeroplane , for which we shall pay a higher price and buy a special stamp . The flying-machine will give a ten-hour service between New York and Chicago and a two-day service from the Atlantic to the Pacific . It will likewise carry letters into remote sections which the mail now reaches only at long intervals or does not reach at all . The United States still has a large number of ' star routes ' ? routes which the mail-carrier travels on horseback , sometimes consuming days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work much more cheaply and much quicker . It i goes in a straight line , whereas the star route man has usually to take a roundabout course , for mountains and rivers offer the flying-machine no obstacles . " " In Mexico we have had an example of the use of the aeroplane for carrying mails . Practically all the mails from Columbus , New Mexico , to Pershing 's col-umn have been carried by air . My friend , Mr. Glenn Martin , who spent several days down there , tells an mcident that illustrates the mail-carrying possibilities of this new contrivance . While visiting Captain Dodd , command-ing officer of the First Aern Squadron , stationed at Pershing 's supply head-quarters in Columbus , Mr. Martin and several officers were standing on the field one morning when a message came saying that Lieutenant Bowen had left Persh-ing 's station , one hun-dred and twenty miles south of the border , by aeroplane with mail-matter . Captain Dodd related that a daily mail-route was maintained by air . Looking to the south the captain pointed out a familiar dust-cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pershing 's station . The great contrast to the truckt rain they were looking at was very striking at this partic-ular time , as the mes-sage just received from Pershing said that I.ieu-tenant Bowen was leav-ing his headquarters by aeroplane . On the ho-rizon was a truck-train which had been on the way two days and a half and was still a half-day out of Colum-bus . An hour and twenty-two minutes later Lieutenant Bowen arrived and spi-raled into the field . The incident was passed over until train time , eleven-thirty , the hour Mr. Martin was leaving Columbus for New York . As the train pulled out the dust-cloud following the truck-train was still approaching from the south ; apparently it was still two or three hours away . It had taken the aeroplane not an hour and a half to make the trip ; and the truck-train , covering the same distance , had been two and a half days and had not yet arrived . " Aeroplanes in Mexico also carried extra officers from one headquarters to another , and important personal matter and express between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a spurt ? " I asked . MY HEART IS VERY QUIET 61.9 " I think , " Mr. Wright replied , " that it is the greatest sport yet devised . It is far more exhilarating and delightful than the automobile for high speed , and far safer . The time is not far distant when people will take their Sunday-afternoon spins in their aeroplane precisely as they do now in their automobiles . Long tours in the air will offer greater relaxations from the daily grind than long railway journeys . People need only recover from the foolish impression that it is a dangerous sport , instead of being , when adopted by rational persons , one of the safest . It is also far more comfortable . The driver of an automobile , even under the most favorable circumstances , lives at a constant nerve tension . He must keep always on the lookout for obstructions in the road , for other automobiles , and for sudden emergencies . A long drive is therefore likely to be an exhausting operation . Now the aeroplane has a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is absent . The driver enjoys the proceeding as much as his passengers , and probably more . He can make mistakes , even lapse in his attention , without any serious consequences . Winds no longer terrorize the airman . Newspaper readers will remember that , ten years ago , my brother and I carefully selected the daysin which we made our flights . Some days , when there was too much wind , we would not fly at all . But we have learned now how to fly , and even strong gales do not now frighten the flyer . He goes up except in the very bad days . The only wind conditions that deter him now are the kind known as ' cyclonic , ' when there are great twists in the atmosphere . Under these circumstances he does not In conclusion , Mr. Wright made one of his most interesting statements . " Aeroplaning , as a sport , " he said , " will attract women as well as men . Indeed , in such aviators as have come to my attention , I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . I would hardly hazard the statement that women are better aviators ? merely that I have found this to be the case in those whom I have met . Just why this should be so I do not know ; yet there is a fascination and exhilaration in flying that appeals strongly to the feminine mind . Women also make excellent passengers . I have never yet taken up one who was not extremely eager to repeat the experience . This fact , of course , will hasten the day when the aeroplane will be a great sporting and social diversion .
