WHEN I was a boy in Scotland I was fond of everything that was wild , and all my life I 've been growing fonder and fonder of wild places and wild creatures . Fortunately , around my native town of Dunbar , by the stormy North Sea , there was no lack of wildness , though most of the land lay in smooth cultivation . With red-blooded playmates , wild as myself , I loved to wander in the fields to hear the birds sing , and along the seashore to gaze and wonder at the shells and seaweeds , eels and crabs in the pools among the rocks when the tide was low . And , best of all , in glorious storms to watch the waves thundering on the black headlands and craggy ruins of the old Dunbar Castle when the sea and the sky , the waves and the clouds , were mingled together as one . After I was five or six years old I ran away to the seashore or the fields almost every Saturday , and every day in the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play at home in the garden and backyard , lest I should learn to think bad thoughts and say bad words . All in vain . In spite of the sure sore punishments that followed like shadows , the natural inherited wildness in our blood ran true on its glorious course , as ? invincible and unstoppable as the stars . My earliest recollections of the country were gained on short walks with my grandfather when I was perhaps not over three years old . On one of these walks grandfather took me to Lord Lauderdale 's gardens , where I saw figs growing against a sunny wall and tasted some of them , and got as many apples to eat as I wished . On another memorable walk in a hay-field , when we sat down to rest on one of the haycocks , I heard a sharp , prickly , stinging cry , and jumping up eagerly , called grandfather 's attention to it . He said he heard only the wind , but I insisted on digging into the hay and turning it over until we discovered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with half a dozen naked young hanging to her teats . This to me was a wonderful discovery . No hunter could have been more excited on discovering a bear and her cubs in a wilderness den . I was sent to school before I had completed my third year . The first school-day was doubtless full of wonders , but I am not able to recall any of them . I remember the servant washing my face and getting soap in my eyes , and mother hanging a little green bag with my first book in it around my neck so I would not lose it , and its blowing back in the sea-wind like a flag . But before I was sent to school my grandfather , as I was told , had taught me my letters from shop signs across the street . I can remember distinctly how proud I was when I had spelled my way through the little first book into the second , which seemed large and important , and so on to the third . Going from one book to another formed a grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in clear relief . At this time infants were baptized and vaccinated a few days after birth . I remember very well a fight with the doctor when my brother David was vaccinated . This happened , I think , before I was sent to school . I could not imagine what the doctor , a tall , severe-looking man in black , was doing to my brother ; but as mother , who was holding him in her arms , offered no objection , I looked on quietly while he scratched the arm , until I saw blood . Then , unable to trust even my mother , I managed to spring up high enough to grab and bite the doctor 's arm , yelling that ' I wasna gan to let him hurt my bonnie brither , ' while to my utter astonishment mother and the doctor only laughed at me . So far from complete at times is sympathy between parents and children , and so much like wild beasts are baby boys : little fighting , biting , climbing pagans . Father was proud of his garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much like Eden as possible , and in a corner of it he gave each of us a little bit of ground for our very own , in which we planted what we best liked , wondering how the hard dry seeds could change into soft leaves and flowers and find their way out to the light ; and to see how they were coming on we used to dig up the larger ones , such as peas and beans , every day . My aunt had a corner assigned to her in our garden , which she filled with lilies , and we all looked with the utmost respect and admiration at that precious lily-bed , and wondered whether when we grew up we should ever be rich enough to own one anything like so grand . We imagined that each lily was worth an enormous sum of money , and never dared to touch a single leaf or petal of them . We really stood in awe of them . Far , far was I then from the wild-lily gardens of California , which I was destined to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Mungo Siddons 's school a flower-show was held in Dunbar and I saw a number of the exhibitors carrying large handfuls of dahlias , the first I had ever seen . I thought them marvelous in size and beauty and , as in the case of my aunt 's lilies , wondered if I should ever be rich enough to own some of them . Although I never dared to touch my aunt 's sacred lilies , I have good cause to remember stealing some common flowers from an apothecary , Peter Lawson , who also answered the purpose of a regular physician to most of the poor people of the town and adjacent country . He had a pony which was considered very wild and dangerous , and when he was called out of town he mounted this wonderful beast , which after standing long in the stable was frisky and boisterous , and often to our delight reared and jumped and danced about from side to side of the street before he could be persuaded to go ahead . We boys gazed in awful admiration and wondered how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get on and stay on that wild beast 's back . This famous Peter loved flowers and had a fine garden surrounded by an iron fence , through the bars of which , when I thought no one saw me , I oftentimes snatched a flower and took to my heels . One day Peter discovered me in this mischief , dashed out into the street and caught me . I screamed that I wouldna steal any more if he would let me go . He did n't say anything , but just dragged me along to the stable where he kept the wild pony , pushed me in right back of his heels , and shut the door . I was screaming of course , but as soon as I was imprisoned the fear of being kicked quenched all noise . I hardly dared breathe . My only hope was in motionless silence . Imagine the agony I endured ! I did n't steal any more of his flowers . He was a good hard judge of boy nature . It appears natural for children to be fond of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrived to make necessary bathing for health terrible to us . I well remember among the awful experiences of childhood being taken by the servant to the seashore when I was between two and three years old , stripped at the side of a deep pool in the rocks , plunged into it among crawling crawfish and slippery wriggling snake-like eels , and drawn up gasping and shrieking only to be plunged down again and again . As the time approached for this terrible bathing I used to hide in the darkest corners of the house , and oftentimes a long search was required to find me . But after we were a few years older we enjoyed bathing with other boys as we wandered along the shore , careful however not to get into a pool that had an invisible boy-devouring monster at the bottom of it . Such pools , miniature maelstroms , were called Sookin-ingoats , ' and were well known to most of us . Nevertheless we never ventured into any pool on strange parts of the coast before we had thrust a stick into it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we boldly entered , and enjoyed plashing and ducking long ere we had learned to swim . Most of the Scotch children believe in ghosts , and some under peculiar con- ditions continue to believe in them all through life . Grave ghosts are deemed particularly dangerous , and many of the most credulous will go far out of their way to avoid passing through or near a graveyard in the dark . After being instructed by the servants in the nature , looks , and habits of the various black and white ghosts , boowuzzies , and witches , we often speculated as to whether they could run fast , and tried to believe that we had a good chance to get away from most of them . To improve our speed and wind we often took long runs into the country . Tam o ' Shanter 's mare outran a lot of witches , ? at least until she reached a place of safety beyond the keystone of the bridge , ? and we thought perhaps we also might be able to outrun them . ii Our house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told us that the ghost of the dead doctor haunted one of the unoccupied rooms in the second story , that was kept dark on account of a heavy window-tax . Our bedroom was adjacent to the ghost room , which had in it a lot of chemical apparatus , ? glass-tubing , glass and brass retorts , test-tubes , flasks , etc. , ? and we thought that those strange articles were still used by the old dead doctor in compounding physic . In the long summer days David and I were put to bed several hours before sunset . Mother tucked us in carefully , drew the curtains of the big old-fashioned bed , and told us to lie still and sleep like gude bairns ; but we were usually out of bed , playing games of daring called ' scootchers , ' about as soon as our loving mother reached the foot of the stairs , for we could n't lie still , however hard we might try . Going into the ghost room was regarded as a very great scootcher . After venturing in a few steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David to go as far without getting caught . The roof of our house , as well as the crags and walls of the old castle , offered fine mountaineering exercise . Our bedroom was lighted by a dormer window . One night I opened it in search of good scootchers and hung myself out over the slates , holding on to the sill , while the wind was making a balloon of my nightgown . I then dared David to try the adventure , and he did . Then I went out again and hung by one hand , and David did the same . Then I hung by one finger , being careful not to slip , and he did that too . Then I stood on the sill and examined the edge of the left wall of the window , crept up the slates along its side by slight finger-holds , got astride of the roof , sat there a few minutes looking at the scenery over the garden wall while the wind was howling and threatening to blow me off , managed to slip down , catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . But before attempting this scootcher , recognizing its dangerous character , with commendable caution I warned David that in case I should happen to slip I would grip the rain trough when I was going over the eaves and hang on , and that he must then run fast downstairs and tell father to get a ladder for me , and tell him to be quick because I would soon be tired hanging dangling in the wind by my hands . After my return from this capital scootcher , David , not to be outdone , crawled up to the top of the window roof , and got bravely astride of it ; but in trying to return he lost courage and began to greet ( to cry ) , ' I canna get doon . Oh , I canna get doon . ' I leaned out of the window and shouted encouragingly , Dinna greet , Davie , dinna greet , I 'll help ye doon . If you greet , fayther will hear , and gee us baith an awfu ' skelping . ' Then , standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the win . dow casing , I directed him to slip his feet down within reach , and after securing a good hold , I jumped inside and dragged him in by his heels . This finished scootcher-scrambling for the night and frightened us into bed . Boys are often at once cruel and merciful , thoughtlessly hard-hearted and tender-hearted , sympathetic , pitiful , and kind in ever changing contrasts . Love of neighbors , human or animal , grows up amid savage traits , coarse and fine . When father made out to get us securely locked up in the backyard to prevent our shore and field wanderings , we had to play away the comparatively dull time as best we could . One of our amusements was hunting cats without seriously hurting them . These sagacious animals knew , however , that , though not very dangerous , boys were not to be trusted . Once in particular , I remember , we began throwing stones at an experienced old Tom , not wishing to hurt him much , though he was a tempting mark . He soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable and climbed to the top of the hay-manger . He was still within range , however , and we kept the stones flying faster and faster , but he just blinked and played possum without wincing either at our best shots or at the noise we made . I happened to strike him pretty hard with a good-sized pebble , but he still blinked and sat still as if without feeling . ' He must be mortally wounded , ' I said , ' and now we must kill him to put him out of pain , ' the savage in us rapidly growing with indulgence . All took heartily to this sort of cat mercy and began throwing the heaviest stones we could manage , but that old fellow knew what characters we were , and just as we imagined him mercifully dead he evidently thought that the play was becoming too serious and it was time to retreat ; for suddenly with a wild whir and gurr of energy , he launched himself over our heads , rushed across the yard in a blur of speed , climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall ? out of pain and bad company , with all his lives wide-awake and in good working order . After we had thus learned that Tom had at least nine lives , we tried to verify the common saying that no matter how far cats fall they always land on their feet unhurt . We caught one in our back-yard ? not Tom , but a smaller one of manageable size ? and somehow got him smuggled up to the top story of the house . I do n't know how on earth we managed to let go of him , for when we opened the window and held him over the sill he knew his danger and made violent efforts to scratch and bite his way back into the room ; but we determined to carry the thing through , and at last managed to drop him . I can remember to this day how the poor creature in danger of his life strained and balanced as he was falling , and managed to alight on his feet . This was a cruel thing for even wild boys to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for we sincerely pitied the poor fellow when we saw him creeping slowly away , stunned and frightened , with a swollen black-and-blue chin . Again , showing the natural savagery of boys , we delighted in dog fights , and even in the horrid red work of slaughter houses , often running long distances and climbing over walls and roofs to see a pig killed , as soon as we heard the desperately earnest squealing . And if the butcher was good-natured , we begged him to let us get a near view of the mysterious insides , and to give us a bladder to blow up for a football . But here is an illustration of the better side of boy nature . In our back-yard there were three elm trees , and in the one nearest the house a pair of robin-redbreasts had their nest . When the young were almost able to fly , a troop of the celebrated ' Scots Grays ' visited Dunbar , and three or four of their fine horses were lodged in our stable . When the soldiers were polishing their swords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as they were leaving , one of them climbed the tree and robbed it . With sore sympathy we watched the young birds as the hardhearted robber pushed them one by one beneath his jacket ? all but two that jumped out of the nest and tried to fly ; but they were easily caught as they fluttered on the ground , and were hidden away with the rest . The distress of the bereaved parents , as they hovered and screamed over the frightened crying children they so long had loved and sheltered and fed , was pitiful to see ; but the shining soldier rode grandly away on his big gray horse , caring only for the few pennies the young song-birds would bring and the beer they would buy , while we all , sisters and brothers , were crying and sobbing . I remember as if it happened this day how my heart fairly ached and choked me . Mother put us to bed and tried to comfort us , telling us that the little birds would be well fed and grow big , and soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again we rehearsed the sad story of the poor bereaved birds and their frightened children , and could not be comforted . Father came into the room when we were half asleep and still sobbing , and I heard mother telling him that , A ' the bairns ' hearts were broken over the robbing of the nest in the elm . ' After attaining the manly belligerent age of five or six years , very few of my school-days passed without a fist fight , and half a dozen was no uncommon number . When any classmate of our own age questioned our rank and standing as fighters we always made haste to settle the matter at a quiet place on the Davel Brae . To be a gude fechter ' was our highest ambition , our dearest aim in life in or out of school . To be a good scholar was a secondary consideration , though we tried hard to hold high places in our classes and gloried in being Dux . We fairly reveled in the battle stories of glorious William Wallace and Robert the Bruce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of course we were all going to be soldiers . On the Davel Brae battleground we often managed to bring on something like real war , greatly more exciting than personal combat . Choosing leaders , we divided into two armies . In winter damp snow furnished plenty of ammunition to make the thing serious , and in summer sand and grass-sods . Cheering and shouting some battle-cry such as ' Bannockburn ! Bannockburn ! Scotland forever ! The Last War in India ! ' we were led bravely on . For heavy battery work we stuffed our Scotch blue bonnets with snow and sand , sometimes mixed with gravel , and fired them at each other as cannon balls . III An exciting time came when at the age of seven or eight years I left the auld Davel Brae school for the grammar school . Of course I had a terrible lot of fighting to do , because a new scholar had to meet every one of his age who dared to challenge him , this being the common introduction to a new school . It was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting rank , taking up new studies , especially Latin and French , getting acquainted with new classmates and the master and his rules . In the first few Latin and French lessons the new teacher , Mr. Lyon , blandly smiled at our comical blunders ; but pedagogical weather of the severest kind quickly set in , when for every mistake , every thing short of perfection , the taws was promptly applied . We had to get three lessons every day in Latin , three in French , and as many in English , besides spelling , history , arithmetic , and geography . Word-lessons in particular , the wouldst couldst shouldst have-loved ' kind , were kept up with much warlike thrashing until I had commit . ted the whole of the French , Latin and English grammars to memory ; and in connection with reading lessons we were called on to recite parts of them with the rules over and over again , as if all the incomprehensible regular and irregular verb-stuff was poetry . In addition to all this , father made me learn so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven years of age I had about three-fourths of the Old Testament and all of the New by heart and by sore flesh . I could recite the New Testament from the beginning of Matthew to the end of Revelation without a single stop . The dangers of cramming and of making scholars study at home , instead of letting their little brains rest , were never heard of in those days . We carried our school-books home in a strap every night and committed to memory our next day 's lessons before we went to bed , and to do that we had to bend our attention as closely on our tasks as lawyers on great million-dollar cases . I can not conceive of anything that would now enable me to concentrate my attention more fully than when I was a mere stripling boy , and it was all done by whipping ? thrashing in general . Old-fashioned Scotch teachers spent no time in seeking short roads to knowledge , or in trying any of the newfangled psychological methods so much in vogue nowadays . There was nothing said about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were simply driven point-blank against our books like soldiers against the enemy , and sternly ordered , ' Up and at ' em . Commit your lessons to memory ! ' If we failed in any part , however slight , we were whipped ; for the grand , simple , ? all-sufficing Scotch discovery had been made that there was a close connection between the skin and the memory , and that irritating the skin excited the memory to any required degree . Fighting was carried on still more vigorously in the high school than in the common school . Whenever anyone was challenged , either the challenge was allowed or it was decided by a battle on the seashore , where with stubborn enthusiasm we battered each other as if we had not been sufficiently battered by the teacher . When we were so fortunate as to finish a fight without getting a black eye , we usually escaped a thrashing at home and another next morning at school , for other traces of the fray could be easily washed off at a well on the church brae , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accidents ; but a black eye could never be explained away from downright fighting . A good double thrashing was the inevitable penalty , but all without avail : fighting went on without the slightest abatement , like natural storms , for no punishment less than death could quench the ancient inherited belligerence in our pagan blood . Nor could we be made to believe that it was fair that father and teacher should thrash us so industriously for our good , while begrudging us the pleasure of thrashing each other for our good . All these carious thrashings however were admirably influential in developing not only memory , but fortitude as well . For if we did not endure our school punishments and fighting pains without flinching and making faces , we were mocked on the playground , and public opinion on a Scotch playground was a powerful agent in controlling behavior ; there- fore we at length managed to keep our features in smooth repose while enduring pain that would try anybody but an American Indian . Far from feeling that we were called on to endure too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other with whips about two feet long , made from the tough wiry stems of a species of polygonum fastened together in a stiff firm braid . Handing two of these whips to a companion to take his choice , we stood up close together and thrashed each other on the legs until one succumbed to the intolerable pain , and thus lost the game . Nearly all our playground games were strenuous : shin-battering shinny , wrestling , prisoners ' base , and dogsand-hares ; all augmenting , in no slight degree , our lessons in fortitude . Moreover , we regarded our punishments and pains of every sort as training for war , since we were all going to be soldiers . Besides single combats we sometimes assembled on Saturdays to meet the scholars of another school , when very little was required for the growth of strained relations , and war . The immediate cause might be nothing more than a saucy stare ; perhaps the scholar stared at would insolently inquire , ' What are ye glowerin ' at , Bob ? ' Bob would reply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hinder me if ye daur . ' ' Weel , Bob , ' the outraged , stared-at scholar would reply , ' I 'll soon let ye see whether I daur or no ! ' and give Bob a blow on the face . This opened the battle , and ' every good scholar belonging to either school was drawn into it . After both sides were sore and weary , a strong-lunged warrior would be heard above the din of battle shouting , ' I 'll tell ye what we 'll da wi ' ye . If ye ' 11 let us alane we 'll let ye alane ! ' ? and the school-war ended as most others between nations do ; and most of them begin in much the same way . Forty-seven years after leaving this fighting school I returned on a visit to Scotland , and a cousin in Dunbar introduced me to a minister who was acquainted with:the history of the school , and obtained for me an invitation to dine with the new master . Of course I gladly accepted , for I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the battle ground on the sands . Mr. Lyon , our able teacher and thrasher , I learned , had held his place as master of the school for twenty or thirty years after I left it , and had recently died in London , after preparing many young men for the English universities . At the dinner-table , while recalling the amusements and fights of my old school-days , the minister remarked to the new master , ' Now , do n't you wish that you had been teacher in those days , and gained the honor of walloping John Muir ? ' This pleasure so merrily suggested showed that the minister also had been a fighter in his youth . The old free-stone school building was still perfectly sound , but the carved ink-stained desks were almost whittled away . Iv Our most exciting sport was playing with gunpowder . We made guns out of gas-pipe , mounted them on sticks of any shape , clubbed our pennies together for powder , gleaned pieces of lead here and there and cut them into slugs , and while one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these awful weapons we wandered along the beach and fired at the gulls and Solan geese as they passed us . Fortunately we never hurt any of them that we knew of . We also dug holes in the ground , put in a handful or two of powder , tamped it well round a fuse made of a wheat-stalk , and , reaching cautiously forward , touched a match to the straw . This we called making earthquakes . Oftentimes we went home with singed hair and faces well pep . pered with powder-grains that could not be washed out . Then , of course , came a correspondingly severe punish . ment from both father and teacher . Another favorite sport was climbing trees and scaling garden-walls . Boys eight or ten years of age could get over almost any wall by standing on each other 's shoulders , thus making living ladders . To make walls secure against marauders many of them were finished on top with broken bottles imbedded in lime , leaving the cutting edges sticking up ; but , with bunches of grass and weeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the jaggedest of them . Like squirrels that begin to eat nuts long before they are ripe , we began to eat apples about as soon as they were formed , causing of course desperate gastric disturbances , to be cured by castor-oil . Serious were the risks we ran in climbing and squeezing through hedges , and of course among the country-folk we were far from welcome . Farmers passing us on the roads often shouted by way of greeting , ' Oh , you vagabonds ! Back to the toon wi ' ye . Gang back where ye belang . You 're up to mischief I ' se warrant . I can see it . The gamekeeper ' 11 catch ye , and maist-like ye 'll a ' be hanged some day . ' Breakfast in those auld-lang-syne days was simple oatmeal porridge , usually with a little milk or treacle , served in wooden dishes called ' luggies , ' formed of staves hooped together like miniature tubs about four or five inches in diameter . One of the staves , the lug or ear , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle , while the number of luggies ranged in a row on a dresser indicated the size of the family . We never dreamed of anything to come after the porridge , or of asking for more . Our portions were consumed in about a couple of minutes ; then off to school . At noon we came racing home , raven-ously hungry . The mid-day meal , called dinner , was usually vegetable broth , a small piece of boiled mutton , and barley-meal scone . None of us liked the barley-scone bread , therefore we got all we wanted of it , and in desperation had to eat it , for we were always hungry , about as hungry after as before meals . The evening meal was called ' tea , ' and was served on our return from school . It consisted , so far as we children were concerned , of half a slice of white bread without butter , barley-scone , and warm water with a little milk and sugar in it , a beverage called ' content , ' which warmed , but neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street with our books to Grandfather Gilrye , who took pleasure in seeing us and hearing us recite our next day 's lessons . Then back home to supper , usually a boiled potato and piece of barley-scone . Then family worship and to bed . Our amusements on Saturday after-noons and vacations depended mostly on getting away from home into the country , especially in the spring when the birds were calling loudest . Father sternly forbade David and me to play truant in the fields with plundering wanderers like ourselves , fearing that we might go on from bad to worse , get hurt in climbing over walls , get caught by gamekeepers , or lost by fall-ing over a cliff into the sea . ' Play as much as you like in the back-yard and garden , ' he said , ' and mind what you 'll get when you forget and disobey . ' Thus he warned us with an awfully stern countenance , looking very hard-hearted , while naturally his heart was far from hard , though he devoutly be- lieved in eternal punishment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like devout martyrs of wildness , we stole away to the seashore , or the // green sunnyfields , with almost religious regularity , taking advantage of opportunities when father was very busy to join our companions , oftenest to hear the birds sing , and hunt their nests , glorying in the number we had discovered and called our own . A sample of our nest-chatter was something like this . Willie Chisholm would proudly exclaim , ' I ken know seventeen nests and you , Johnnie , ken only fifteen . ' But I wouldna gie my fifteen for your seventeen , for five of mine are larks and mavises . You ken only three o ' the best singers . ' ' Yes , Johnnie , but I ken six goldies and you ken only one . Maist of yours are only sparrows and linties and robin-redbreasts . ' Then , perhaps , Bob Richardson would loudly declare that he ' kenned mair nests than onybody , for he kenned twenty-three , with about fifty eggs in them , and mair than fifty young birds , ? maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but lots of them as big as their mithers and ready to flee . And aboot fifty craws ' nests and three fox-dens . ' ' Oh , yes , Bob , but that 's no fair , for naebody counts craws ' nests and foxholes , and then you live in the country at Belle-haven where ye have the best chance . ' ' Yes , but I ken a lot of bumbee 's nests , baith the red-legged and the yellow-legged kind . ' ' Oh , wha cares for bumbee 's nests ! ' ' Wed , but here 's something ! My father let me gang to a fox-hunt , and , man , it was grand to see the hounds and the long-legged horses lowpin ' the dikes and burns and hedges ! ' The nests , I fear , with the beautiful eggs and young birds , were prized quite as highly as the songs of the glad parents , but no Scotch boy that I know of ever failed to listen with enthusiasm to the songs of the skylarks . Oftentimes , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoying their marvelous singing and soaring . From the grass where the nest was hidden the male would suddenly rise , as straight as if shot , up to a height of perhaps thirty or forty feet , and sustaining himself with rapid wing-beats , pour down the most delicious melody , sweet and clear and strong , overflowing all bounds ; then suddenly he would soar higher , again and again , ever higher and higher , soaring and singing until lost to sight even on perfectly clear days , and oftentimes in cloudy weather , ' Far in the downy cloud , ' as the poet says . To test our eyes we often watched a lark until he seemed a faint speck in the sky and finally passed beyond the keenest-sighted of us all . I see him yet ! ' we would cry , ' I see him yet ! ' I see him yet ! ' I see him yet ! ' as he soared . And finally only one of us would be left to claim that he still saw him . At last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singer had soared beyond his sight , and still the music came pouring down to us in glorious profusion from a height far above our vision , requiring marvelous power of wing and marvelous power of voice , for that rich , delicious , soft , and yet clear music was distinctly heard long after the bird was out of sight . Then suddenly ceasing , the glorious singer would appear , falling like a bolt straight down to his nest where his mate was sitting on the eggs . In the winter , when there was but little doing in the fields , we organized running-matches . A dozen or so of us would start out on races that were simply tests of endurance , running on and on along a public road over the breezy hills , like hounds , without stopping or getting tired . The only serious trouble we ever felt in these long races was an occasional stitch in our sides . ? One of the boys started the story that sucking raw eggs was a sure cure for the stitches . We had hens in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to swallow a couple of eggs apiece , a disgusting job , but we would do almost anything to mend our speed , and as soon as we could get away , after taking the cure , we set out on a ten-or twenty-mile run to prove its worth . Ne thought nothing of running right ahead ten or a dozen miles before turning back ; for we knew nothing about taking time by the sun , and none of us had a watch in those days . Indeed , we never cared about time until it began to get dark . Then we thought of home and the thrashing that awaited us . Late or early , the thrashing was sure , unless father happened to be away . If he was expected to return soon , mother made haste to get us to bed before his arrival . We escaped the thrashing next morning , for father never felt like thrashing us in cold blood on the calm , holy Sabbath . But no punishment , however sure and severe , was of any avail against the attraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , developing memory , and the like , but in keeping us at home it was of no use at all . Our grammar-school reader , called , I think , Maccoulough 's Course of Reading , contained a few natural history sketches that excited me very much and left a deep impression , especially a fine description of the fish-hawk and the bald eagle by the Scotch ornithologist , Wilson , who had the good fortune to wander for years in the American woods while the country was yet mostly wild . Not less exciting and memorable was Audubon 's wonderful story of the passenger pigeon , a beautiful bird flying in vast flocks that darkened the sky like clouds , countless millions assembling to rest and sleep and rear their young in certain forests , miles in length and breadth , fifty or a hundred nests on a single tree ; the overloaded branches would bend low and often break , and the farmers gathering from far and near would beat down countless thousands of the young and old birds from their nests and roosts with long poles at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hogs , some of them brought from farms a hundred miles distant , to fatten on the dead and wounded covering the ground . In another of our reading-lessons , some of the American forests were described . The most interesting of the trees to us boys was the sugar-maple . And soon after we had learned this sweet story we heard everybody talking about the discovery of gold in the same wonder-filled country . One night , when David and I were at grandfather 's fireside , learning our lessons as usual , my father came in with news , the most wonderful , most glorious , that wild boys ever heard . ' Bairns , ' he said , you needna learn your lessons the nicht for we 're gan to America the morn ! ' No more grammar , but boundless woods full of mysterious good things ; trees full of sugar ; growing in ground full of gold ; hawks , eagles , pigeons , filling the sky ; millions of birds ' nests , and no game-keepers to stop us in all the wild , happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father left the room , grandfather gave David and me a gold coin apiece for a keepsake and looked very serious , for he was about to be deserted in his lonely old age . And when we in fullness of young joy spoke of what we were going to do , of the wonderful birds and their nests that we should find , the sugar and gold , and the rest , and promised to send him a big box full of that tree-sugar packed in gold from the glorious paradise over the sea , poor lonely grandfather , about to be forsaken , looked with downcast eyes on the floor , and said in a low , trembling , troubled voice , ' Ala , poor laddies , poor laddies , you 'll find something else ower the sea forbye gold and sugar , birds ' nests , and freedom fra lessons and schools . You 'll find plenty hard , hard work . ' And so we did . But nothing he could say could cloud our joy or abate the fire of youthful , hopeful , fearless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measureless excitement see or feel the shadows and sorrows of his darkening old age . To my school-mates whom I met that night on the street , I shouted the glorious news , I 'm gan to Amaraka the morn ! ' None could believe it . I said , Weel , just you see if I am at the skule the morn ! '
