Miss Hegan , a resident of St. John , New Brunswick , and a graduate nurse of the Presbyterian Hospital , New York , was one of the first Canadian young women to go to the front . After some months spent in England and France , she was transferred to the Anglo-Russian Hospital Corps , and served in the Caucasus with conspicuous bravery and efficiency . Miss Hegan and the other Canadian nurses in the corps were stationed in Petrograd when the Revolution broke out . A hospital had been established in the palace of Prince Demetri , and it was from the second-story windows of this historic building , facing the Nevsky Prospekt , that Miss Hegan witnessed some of the bloodiest scenes of the Revolution , as recounted in the following pages from her diary . On reaching England , Miss Hegan was assigned to a vessel sailing with Canadian wounded who had been invalided home . She has re-enlisted for the duration of the war , and has recently returned to the French front. ? EurroR.1 EBRVARY 22. - The Julian calendar , used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which accounts for the apparent variation in dates . February 22 , ac-cording to our calendar , would be , of course , March 7 . I am using both dates in this diary , giving the Julian date first . We have been in Petrograd for nearly six months , having come here direct from the Carpathian mountains , where we were for three months , barely six miles from the firing-lines . Our hospital is in the palace of the Prince Demetri , who has turned it over for the service of the Red Cross . In the rooms where wonderfully gowned women and dashing soldiers and court royalties used to gather there are now white-garbed nurses and suffering Russian peasant soldiers in rows of narrow white bed . Ranks and social lines have been wiped out in this war . As nurses , enlisted in the service of our country , our first duty is to relieve suffering and attend to the wants of our patients . But one does not often see a republic in the making , and so we watched the progress of events as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital is immediately on the Nevsky Prospekt , one of the most picturesque streets in the world . At one endof it is the Alexander Station , and from there it sweeps in a broad curve to the famous Winter Palace . Opposite us is the palace of the Dowager Empress , a long , low , rambling sort of building of reddish stone . Nearby is the famous canal , and the Fontanka Bridge with its wonderfully carved groups of rearing horses at each corner . The buildings on the Nevsky Prospekt are a strange intermingling of the influences that so permeate Russia and that perhaps account in some part for the apparently contradictory Russian mind . Near a grand shop building will be a small junk-shop , with everything in it from a string of fantastically colored and carved beads to wonderful Oriental rugs ? all to be purchased only after a session of just such bargaining as one sees in the Far East . There is a modern trolley line , but the crowd retains a touch of the captivating mystery of the East in the garb of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air of warmth and color ? almost barbaric splendor ? about some of the shops that makes the place seem more Oriental than anything else . To-day we all went to Saraky , six of us from the hospital . We arrived about 2.30 P.M. , drove to the palace and went through . Then we drove to the church of the Czar , which is magnificent ? the finest I have ever seen . It has such wonderful ikons . From there we drove to a restaurant and had tea and dry bread , and then took an open train back to Petrograd . Miss M ? and I drove immediately back to the club where we live , and the others went on to dinner at a Russian restaurant . We have heard rumors , of course , that there are strikes . Many workmen are out of work , they say , owing to the closing of so many mills ; but we have thought little about outside affairs , we are so engrossed in our hospital work . But when the others returned home after dinner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially about us , as there had been rioting . We have had orders to remain indoors and not to go out on the streets , except to the hospital and back . Friday , February 23 ? ( March 8 . ) ? All day crowds have gathered on the Nevsky . Many mounted Cossacks have dashed up and down , but appear to be quite friendly with the crowd that occasionally cheers them wildly . The crowd seems quite good-natured , but now and then there is a little group that appears menacing . The Cossacks were ordered to fire on the people , but refused . The hospital is full of soldiers ready for any emergency , and we have had orders to be prepared to evacuate at once . The people are demanding bread and long lines are standing in front of the shops . The Minister of the Interior says there is no bread for them and very little prospect of getting any . The air is tense with excitement . All mills have shut down and crowds are marching into Petrograd . Saturday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have watched the crowds all day from the window , as we could snatch the time . Nurses tin duty have brought the wounded back and forth all day in ambulances . At the front we only see the wounded as they are brought in ; but here we have only to look from our second-story window to see riots continually in progress and wounded and dying falling everywhere as the police charge the streets from time to time . So many of the Czar 's troops are deserting him and coming over to the Revolutionists that such battles as we can see appear to be hopelessly confused . Regiments of deserting soldiers are fighting former comrades who still remain loyal to the Czar . The famous Cossacks are still with the Czar , but are apparently very lukewarm in their efforts to disperse the Revolutionists . Sometimesthe crowd almost melts away and again it gathers in a moment 's time . There are many women in the throngs . They do not seem to fear the flying bullets at all . When the streets are swept by the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for safety , but the moment the firing is over they come out on the streets again . Cossacks appear from time to time , some with whips and bayonets which they wave menacingly in the air ; but still the crowd cheers them . After lunch we four Canadians took a walk down the Nevsky and over the bridge . The crowd was very dense on the bridge , but anxious watchers from the hospital saw us , and you may be sure we were very freely discussed and reprimanded on our return for venturing out in such a crowd . L - and Miss C went to the dentist and we returned to the hospital to watch once more from the windows . A tremendous crowd had gathered and suddenly the Cossacks and the mounted police charged through the crowd and shooting began . The crowd quickly disappeared . Some fell flat on their stomachs and crawled away . We could hear the click of the machine-guns which the police had hidden in the houses . Some of the police themselves were hidden in the houses and some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped dead in the middle of the street and we saw an old black ambulance drive up and carry him off . We can hear the guns and the noise of actual battle down near the Winter Palace . But almost as soon as the troops come in on orders they join the Revolutionists . Many casualties are reported . We hear that the Chief of Police and many of the policemen have been killed . All sleighs and motors are stopped on the bridge and ordered to go down side-streets . There are cheers from the crowd every time an officer is turned back . The officers are indignant , but after they have witnessed one or two instances of what is done when they resist , they submit . Many of the officers have been arrested by their own soldiers and shot , after the formality of a brief trial . The Russian officials were formerly important figures on the streets . Now they hurry down side-streets to get out of the way . Some of them are wearing a bit of red on their uniforms . Our Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remain at the windows , as already bullets have struck inside the hospital . Sunday , February 25 ? ( March io . ) ? Another fairly peaceful morning , but again about noon the crowd begins to gather . We have positive orders not to go out except to the club and back ; but S ? and I went to see Miss C ? this morning and then went to the Hotel de l'Europe for lunch . Many wounded have been brought in and three of them died . The crowd is quite orderly and peaceful as far as we can see . They continue asking for bread . Suddenly , while we were looking , the machine-guns opened fire and swept the street in every direction . Dozens fell where they stood and others fled in every direction . Many hurried into the doorway of the hospital and the club . A most spectacular occurrence took place about this time when a regiment of Cossacks came slowly up the Nevsky . As they stepped upon the bridge , a shot was they from the roof of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were up and they were gazing straight in front of them . Suddenly I heard a machine-gun click and a shot rang out . It seemed to electrify the Cossacks . One of them fell and we could see his riderless horse with the swinging stirrups galloping on with the rest . For , almost as soon as the click was heard , an order was thundered and , with bent heads and lowered shoulders , the Cossacks rode magnificently over the bridge at full speed . From a regiment of riders they became merely a tawny streak and charged the streets . Many more Cossacks now appeared and dashed rapidly up and down the four streets of the Fontanka and over the bridge . Great lorries loaded with concealed guns dash up and down the streets amid the greatest shouts and confusion . More wounded are still being brought into the hospital . I saw a man I knew brought in dead . He had been quietly walking down the street with his mother to call on a friend when he was shot . He died almost instantly . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them are full of our own patients , so there is little room here for anything but first-aid treatment . They came in rapidly , many of them dying almost as soon as they were brought in . We did what we could for them ; but at night the authorities took them away , except two or three who were too near death to he moved . All day long the Cossacks have charged the streets with whips and drawn swords . The crowds do not seem to be at all afraid of them . I saw one giant Cossack charge on a crowd and yell at a man who seemed to be one of the leaders . He leaned over as he dashed by the man and described an arc in the air with his sword . I saw the sword descend , and while I held my breath in horror it neatly sliced off the top of the man 's hat . He did not seem to be in the least frightened , but walked calmly on , while the crowd cheered them both impartially . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else the sentiment of the Cossacks . He said that a few years ago the Cossack would have sliced off the man 's head , but because at heart he was with the people he let it go at the hat . Monday , February 26 ? ( March r . ) ? The appearance of the crowd changes daily . Sometimes there are many women and sometimes nearly all the women are of the student class . They are clad in the working costumes of blouses and heavy skirts . The advice of the women students seems to be heard with as much respect as that of the men . There seems to he a wonderful camaraderie between them . There are constantly increasing numbers of peasants in the crowd . The red flag of the Revo-lution is everywhere . The Russians are very gregarious and usually gather in one of the three big squares in Petrograd to hold their meetings ; but to-day they have streamed restlessly and constantly up and down the Nevsky . We hear that the Czar has been taken prisoner , which has surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Romanoff . " They used to speak reverently of him as " Little Father , " but now they speak his name with a sort of amused indulgence . Sometimes there are threats against the Czarina , whom they do not seem to like . While we were taking tea in the club there was a whirlwind of renewed shooting and shouting . Numbers of people from the street flocked up our stairs for safety . S and 1 went to the hospital fur duty , but as bullets were flying thick and fast in the streets , we were not allowed to go out again but told to sleep in the hospital . L and C were still in the hospital , so we kept together , sleeping where we could . Some slept in the bandage-rooms on tables and stretchers . We could not sleep long at a time , for many wounded were constantly being brought in . There is fierce fighting down the Vladimirskv , and the nurses who are still at the club must be having a bad night . Stray bullets enter the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter calmly and philosophically . They still entreat us to avoid the windows . But it is such a wonderful picture unfolding itself before us constantly that we can not leave it . We often see officers who do not wear the bit of red , or who are suspected of having German tendencies , sur-rounded by the people who tear away their arms . I saw one fierce officer , THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION FROM A HOSPITAL WINDOW 559 covered with decorations and looking very much annoyed , try to saunter down the Nevsky , pursued by a crowd of women who stripped him of his arms . His sword fell to a gray-haired woman who shrieked apparently uncomplimentary Russian epithets at him as she con-temptuously bent the sword over her i knee , broke it in two , and lightly tossed it into the canal . The Court of Justice was burned today and all prisoners were released from the fortress . The situation seems to be getting beyond control . Soldiers are deserting continually to the cause of the people , and the letting loose of the criminal element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red flags are waving everywhere . We are ordered by the Embassy to put out as many Red Cross flags as possible , and we all turned to and made more to-day . Tuesday , February 28 ? ( March 13 . ) ? The crowd looks very excited to-day . S ? and I were permitted to return to the dub while the others remained at the hospital . After taking a bath and lying down for a moment , we had orders to return to the hospital at once . There was considerable excitement while we hastily gathered up our valuables . Many bullets entered the windows ; but none of us was hurt , although they came pretty close occasionally . To those of us who had been near the Carpathian front all the summer before it was all a part of the day 's work , except for the suppressed excitement that the Revolution had aroused . We heard the tramping of hoofs , the roar of the lorries , and the subdued muttering of the crowd outside , while we gathered our things together . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to decide quickly what must be left and what could be carried in the least space . While we were in the hall waiting for the others to come down , bullets flew through the house . We only looked at each other . Events have piled up so rapidly during the past year for us ? four unadventurous Canadian nurses , that nothing seems to surprise or affect us . The bullets came and went so quickly that it was all over before we could even move . One hummed through the window directly between our heads . When our party was ready , we walked quickly to the hospital . There seemed to have been a subtle change in the demeanor of the crowd , perhaps due to the constant firing . Where they had been merely restless and wandering for days , they seemed bent on a common purpose now . Several times we had to stop while on the way to the hospital , the firing was so heavy . We were anxious to get back to the hospital and worried lest the shots might strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were interested enough to wish to get back to our windows , too , for it is not often that one can watch the death of a monarchy and the birth of a new republic . The thing that no one believed could ever happen has happened . If the rumors we hear are true , the Czar of all the Russias has been dethroned as easily as a recalcitrant school-boy is made to stay in after school . From time to time crowds from the street enter a church to pray before the ikons . Then they return to the streets to renew activities . Most of the Russians are fatalists , which perhaps explains the fact that while they are victorious in this red revolution , they accept their victory almost as philosophically as they have always accepted their defeats . There seems to be a deadly fixedness of purpose in the crowd to-day , as if it had crystallized its own desires . We hear that at Moscow , which is really the heart of Russia , there are no mobs or signs of a revolution . Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are handing out ammunition to everybody and anybody who wears the red badge of the Revolution . We can hear the fighting all over the city and are told that almost all the policemen have been killed . We do not see so many Cossacks on the Nevsky to-day , but a great many soldiers are there . Several regiments marched down the street and attracted great attention and cheering . They were the former guards of the Czar who have deserted him . The revolutionists have sent out soldiers to guard him . A Russian princess who was staying at the Astoria and who was wounded in the neck was brought in to our hospital . She tells us that the Astoria was completely looted . The cooler-headed leaders are trying to restrain their men from violence . An English officer , who was ordered out with the rest when they began its destruction , happened to think of the immense stores of wine in the hotel cellars and went back to try to destroy what he could before the crowd could get at them . So many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere . One of the revolutionists demanded to know where he was going , and when he was told he heartily agreed with the plan and sent a detachment of his men to help destroy the wines . More troops arrived during the night and immediately deserted to the revolutionists . Regiments fought fiercely against one another . During the night an officer and armed guard came to the hospital and demanded twenty-five suits of clothes . They come in daily with orders to search the place , for they have insisted that there is a machine-gun on top of the hospital . The police station is in ruins and all the police ? records have been destroyed . There will never be any papers to convict the revolutionists . We hear that all the convicts in Siberia have been turned loose . Just as soon as the new troops come in and become aware of the situation they proceed to hand over their officers to the people . They are received with hoots and wild cheers . There is a constant procession of officials being taken to the Duma for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The numbers of killed are constantly increasing . The figures given out to-day are 5,000 killed and 6,000 wounded . Many pitiful accounts are brought in . Count S ? , who was the head of the Russian Red Cross , was sought in his home by the mob . His frightened wife clung to him weeping and begged him not to go with them , but to try to escape by a secret way . He reassured her , saying that it was merely a matter of form he expected to be re-leased after a perfunctory trial at the Duma . As he descended the stairs some hasty member of the mob fired a revolver . The mob immediately supposed that Count S had fired it , and it was the beginning of a scene in which he was shot , dragged to the streets , and almost torn limb from limb , under the eyes of his wife . Later she went out to search for him and found his body lying in the streets . The streets are filling with a howling mob . The scenes are indescribable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn loose the convicted prisoners , for they have gone quite mad with blood lust and are leading the mob into all sorts of depredations . The soldiers are handing out guns and ammunition and instructing civilians in the use of them . Newspapers with the news of the Duma are being tossed out to the people from the flying lorries . More shots have penetrated the hospital . It seems a miracle that no one here has been hurt . March r ? ( March 14 . ) ? The crowd looks a bit more orderly this morning from our windows . Nearly all the policemen have been shot and the students have been made policemen . There are placards up all over the streets , begging the people to remain cool and to refrain from rioting . The bread situation is still critical and it is a problem to feed all the soldiers . The citizens are asked not to resist the student policemen and to help feed the soldiers . Squads are out collecting all the arms given out the day before and trying to gather in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best to suppress the criminal element . Prices of food that had gone up by leaps and bounds are now coming down . Butter and eggs and bread are reduced materially in price . News of what is occurring is still being circulated by small newspapers . Friday , March 3 ? ( March 16 . ) ? We were allowed to go to the club to-day for our meals . The weather has been fine - until to-day and the streets are quiet . We hear that the Grand Duke Michael is to be Regent for the Czarevitch . The Czar and the Czarina are prisoners ! Three months ago we would have said that nothing stood on a firmer founda-tion than this Russian throne . But the Czar and Czarina are imprisoned in their own fortress . It is such a stupendous THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION change that the mind can hardly grasp it . But we go ahead and do our work ? for the daily tasks of a nation must be done , even if thrones totter and fall and kingdoms are ground to dust beneath our feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hungry , and going on with the simple work of the day preserves the balance for us , I suppose . The people are tearing down the imperial signs all over the city . I saw several destroyed and thrown in the Fontanka . The sign on our hospital has been painted over and the eagle torn down . We hear that at a meeting of the Duma they declared that they would leave nothing of the House of Romanoff , and that the Czar had quite meekly abdicated in favor of his son . But it is hard to credit all the rumors . We even heard this morning that the Emperor had been taken and the Crown Prince killed . It is plain that the Germans started the Revolution ; but it soon became a Frankenstein on their hands and they would give anything now to suppress it . Having thrown off the yoke of centuries of oppression , the Russians refuse to listen to German dictation . It is astonishing how peaceful and orderly everything is . There is a complete absence of looting or drinking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Fortress of St. Peter , they say . S ? and I ventured down to the Astoria to-day and walked around the ruins . It has been completely destroyed . March 4 ? ( March r7. )  - -  - The streets are filled with a surging , changing crowd . Everything is quiet , but it is the uncanny quiet that comes either just before or just after a terrible storm . Red flags are flying everywhere . Russia is a republic ! Motor-cars are dashing about in every direction , throwing out newspapers . The Department of Justice has been burned . We walked up that way to-day and saw the bullet holes in the buildings near by . Monday , March 6 ? ( March ig . ) ? Word came to-day that the boats are running . It seems almost too good to Vox .. CXXXV. ? No. 808. - 71 FROM A HOSPITAL WINDOW 561 be true . There is a chance of our getting home again after almost a year here and at the Carpathian front . We went at once to see about our passports and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Russian restaurant and went home . Everything seems to be quiet and it is strange to think that only a few days ago these streets were filled with dead and dying , with soldiers and police maintaining a running fight constantly amid the confusion of cheering mobs . The new republic seems to be moving along smoothly , although we hear of fierce arguments among the new leaders at the Duma . Wednesday , March 8 ? ( March 21 . ) ? S and I drove to the consul 's and the last touch was put on our passports . Our tickets are bought for Saturday . Shops are all open and we did a little hasty shopping . The struggle seems to be over . We have seen the birth of a new republic ? but I never want to witness another . Now that it is over and I can take stock of my- thoughts , I find it hard to do more than to pick out such events of that terrible week as stand out in my memory against that dreadful red background . The travail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its mark on the Russian , people . The crowds seem more serious moredignified . They gather here and there in groups , separate , and form again . It may be difficult for them to rule themselves . The Russian peasant , in particular , is simple , direct , but largely elemental . We have heard rumors that the Russians will consent to a separate peace . I do not believe it . They are strongly pro-ally , and if there is to be a separate peace it will not be with the consent of the Russian soldiers . Underneath their apparent apathy is a growing distaste for having Russia Germanized . In a way , they have a queer streak of fatalism ; but no Russian is a quitter . March co. ? Going home at last . Everything is packed and ready . We hope for a peaceful voyage . This is my last entry in my Russian diary .
