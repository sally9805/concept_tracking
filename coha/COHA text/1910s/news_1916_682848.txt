txt " We have drunk to our English brother , " sings KIPLING . " and we hope bent understand . " Our English brother does not understand that the peace fort which " Cosmos " contends in his contributions to THE TIMES , now attracting worldwide attention , is the riltene peace , identically the same peace , that the British Prime Minister declared to he the only one the Allies would accept , peace that . " when it comes , must be such as will " be built upon a sure and stable " foundation , the security of the " weak , the liberties of Europe , the " free future of the world . " The London Chronicle in its editorial comment upon the articles contributed by ' ? Cosmos ? ? to this newspaper declares that a peace would be utterly worthless if contreeted with the false Power that invaded Belgium in 1914 , the Power that is now driving Belgians into slavery , the Power that sank the Lusitania , since an undertaking given by such a Power could have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight on for a solid material guarantee , " not for a Peace made to be broken before Waterloo , " we need an after-Waterloo peace . " But if a peace embodying every quality of righteousness and justice , having all the stability of an after-Waterloo peace , can he achieved without the appalling sacrifice of blood and treasure which the Water10o simile connotes , why should it not toe talked about , considered , and when the day comes , as we hope it will come , be accepted ? The London Times says that the British reply to the suggestion of " Cosmos " " is still contained in " Premier A SQ ? ' IT it 's Guildhall declara " ton. - That ileciaration e here sub Join : We shall never sheathe the sword , which we inc. ? ? drawn . until Beigi , nn Teem:ere in full measure all and more than all that she has Fiterificed , until France is adequately secured against the menace of aggression , until the ritzlits of the smaller nationalities of Europe are placed upon an unassailable foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finally destroyed . The security of France against the Menace of aggression , the rights of the smaller European nationalities established upon an unassailable foundation , and the complete and final destruction of " the rani-tart- domination of Prussia " are all embodied in the plan of peace which - Cosmos - discusses , as our British friends will see when the plan is fully set forth . Neither THE TIMES nor its contributor Las entered upon this discussion without forethought . Neither the one nor the other would for a moment assume that a peace which did not assure protection against the aggressions of Prussian militarism , which did not provide for the freedom of nationalities small and great , would be worth making . The conditions set forth by Prime Minister Asetern are the essence , the indispensable foundations of peace . Reared upon any other foundations the structure would be insecure . This we hope our British brother ' will see and understand . We well Njtnow that all talk of peace now runs , se Counter to one of the strongest impulses in the heart and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the feeling that crime should have its exemplary punishment . The crime of bringing on this war transcends in its awful guilt any other crime chargeable against men or Governments . It is natural , it is inevitable , that in the countries of the there should be a demand that that great transgression be atoned for upon the field of a second Waterloo . We are not surprised , therefore , /bat , totally misunderstanding the luggestions of " Cosmos " as embpdying the proposal that the war be deplored a " draw , " English sentiment should reject it . Nothing could be further from the truth than the belief that it Is argued in - these articles that the accepted end of the war should be a " draw . " The war is not a " draw , " nothing can make it a " draw . " Germany and Austria . are already defeated , the war which they - began is ended , since , the purposes for they began it are now forever ** their grasp , or perhaps it ; 1 ? ? would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed over into " a struggle for very different purposes . It is now a war of dynasties fighting for their lives . If at the end of the war the Hohenzollern were left free to continue their age-long policies , if Germany were left under their domination , it would be necessary to begin without an instant 's delay the preparation for the next war , Peace on such terms is not worth making , for all the enormous sacrifices thus far made by the Allies would have been in vain . Nothing could be further front the thoughts of " Cosmos or of THE TIMES . But if the German people , now suffering privations and enduring miseries of which the outside world has no true conception , should take it into their heads to achieve their own liberation , to deliver themselves from the I horrors which nothing but the desper ' ation and the selfish designs of their ruling classes now compel them to endure , the Waterloo of which our British brethren speak would have come to achievement , all the purposes of the war save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished . An honorable peace could be made , a peace of victory , a peace based upon " the liberties of Europe , the free future of the world . " Surely the war could end then , end formally in the signing of the peace treaty . So far as human vision can Pierce the future . that is probably the only way it could end save through the actual conquest and devastation of Germany by arms . 14 he blockade of the Allies has enforced upon the Central Powers the dreadful and increasing constraint of want that is every day approaching nearer to actual starration . Are the resources of England and the Allies limited to shutting out foodstuffs and supplies from Germany and Austria ? Can they not contrive , means to supply the people of the Central Powers with generous exports of ideas ? Would it be impossible for our brethren in leneland to make it known within the Kaiser 's dominion that their quarrel is with the Prussian hydra , not with the German people ? There are responsive minds in Germany , plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lines of the enemy as well as without .. The time is propitious . The last Hapsl.urg of whom history will be able to ? gay that he governed as well as reigned lies cold in death . Already in Russia the public press has the courage to say and is permitted to say that nothing can hold back the Empire from the precipice save the creation of a responsible ministry , of a constitutional form of Government . The anachronisms of absolute rule and of divine right are in truth upon the edge of a precipice . No great impulse is required to push them over the brink . To the natural and growing yearning for greater liberty in Germany there is added the incalculable auxiliaryforce of the revolt against Intolerable suffering and privation . Enlightened and liberal minds in Germany . and there are many of them , are ready for the sowing of the seed . The task will be difficult . Can it he more difficult than the continued ' marshaling and employment of millions of men and all the enginery of war for two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be less costly and the ' harvest would not be one of blood .
