txt the scathing arraignment of the New Haven management by the Interstate Commerce Commission adds dramatic interest to the selection of a Justice of the Supreme Court to filt the vacancy caused by the death of Justice Lurton . In all talk in official circles about possible selections the place of honor and preference is given to Attorney General . Just at present Mr. has on his hands a large task in dissolving the New Haven system and bringing a gigantic monopoly into harmony with the anti-trust law . But in his conduct of the Government 's case he and T. W. Folk , the civet counsel of the Interstate Commerce Commission , have not agreed and the commission has pursued a course diametrically opposite to that counseled by the Attorney General . If President Wilson should decide to appoint his Attorney General to the Supreme Bench he would immediately be confronted with the candidacy of Mr. Folk to succeed Mr. as Attorney General . Mr. Folk said today that it was not only true that the Directors of the New Haven should be prosecuted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there should be criminal prosecutions under the anti-trust law . The commission 's report on the New Haven stopped short of making that declaration because such . a prosecution is in the province of the Attorney General , and there was a desire if possible to avoid any further clash with Mr. MeReynolds . But the Commissioners , it is said , would be delighted if the President and the Attorney General after reading the report were to decide that the Government . had a case , and that indictments ' should be sought without delay . There is no disguising the fact that Mr. Folk would be a candidate for Attorney General It Mr. went to the Supreme Bench , and it is equally plain that if he were in Mr. Melleynolds 's place he would start criminal prosecutions of the New Haven Directors without delay . Mr. Folk , it was said , would have the support of both Secretary Bryan and Champ Clark . There was ' little disposition- at either the Department of Justice or the Interstate Commerce Commission today to dis'cuss.the New Haven report . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the unsparing review of the alleged wrongdoing of Nevi Haven officials , Members of the Interstate Commerce Commission merely said , The report speaks for itself . " Mr. Folk said that the conclusions of the report were made ' Main enough to show that there was the broadest possible ground for . Federal prosecution . When it was suggested that the Attorney General might first attempt to dissolve the New Haven mergers and then proceed with the prosecutions of Directors . he said : " Oh , if it is waiting you want , there are plenty of things that can be waited for . But there is no need to wait , if men have been guilty of criminal acts and the proof is in your hands . " It was said that much of the material upon which the Interstate Commerce Commission based its report had been furnished by the Department of Justice , and that the department had a mass of information which it had collected itself . The inference from remarks of this character was that the department did not need the evidence . collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such testimony taken by the commission in , its New Haven investigation as has been transcribed has been forwarded to State and county District Attorneys in the States of New York . Connecticut , Rhode Island , and Massachusetts . The full record of testimony is being printed and when this work has been completed copies will be forwarded to the prosecuting officers involved . Information as to who were the State prosecuting officers to whom copies of the testimony had been sent was refused at the offices of the commission today . It was learned , however , that a copy of the testimony , or part of it , had been sent to the District Attorney for Bronx County . This action of the commission nas particular reference to the testimony obtained in regard to the New Haven deal by which it acquired the Is4c.w York . Westchester &; Boston Railway I Company . That deal , according to Lhe testimony of Charles S. Mellen , involved the services of the late Thomas Byrnes , former Inspector of Police in New York City , as a distributer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' stock at the rate of three shares of Westchester for one of New Haven . After reviewing the testimony of Mr. Mellen concerning the operations of Mr. Byrnes in this direction the commission decided that this deal was of a corrupt and unlawful nature . It was suggested by the testimony taken in regard to this phase of the New Haven case that the distribution of stock was related to efforts to obtain changes-in the tranchise of the Westchester railroad . Final determination of the question whether criminal indictments shall be sought by the Department of Justice against the Directors probably will not be reached until the conclusion of the negotiations for a peaceful dissolution of that system . The fate of these negotiations is said to depend largely upon the action of the New Haven board at a meeting scheduled for New York Thursday , when it is also expected the Interstate Commerce Commission report will be considered . It has been well understood in Administration circles that the department is anxious to get the civil dissolution of the New Haven out of the way before it takes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department theory of the matter , the New Haven grip on the transportation of New England is absolute , and It is more imperative that it be broken then that a Sew indictments be asked for which could not in any way restore competition to that section . In the negotiations with New Haven officials and lawyers for a peaceful dissolution it has .. been thoroughly understood that the question , of criminal Indictments was . not involved , and the . open is . en tor . the department to proceedif. it- isdeenhed wise , and , it believed there is evidence to obtain convictions . The Interstate Commission 's report was today before the Senate Committee working to frame legislation for control of railroad financing , interlocking directorates , and other subjects concerned in the investigation . AWAITING THE EVIDENCE . Prosecutors Plan No Action Yet-. - Statement by Melien 's Counsel . Discussion of . New Haven affairs yesterday turned on the . possibility of criminal prosecutions , as suggested by the Interstate Commerce Commission , which said in its report that copies of the evidence would be forwarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts were commit ted . The question of the Statute of Limitations was raised , but some attorneys were of opinion that it would not run from the time the transactions were effected , but from the time of their disclosure . District Attorney Wnitman of New York County and District Attorney Martin of Bronx County , according to ad-1 vices from Washington , will receive from the Department of Justice evidence on which they can act in unearthing the alleged crimes committed in the financing of the New Haven extensions . particularly with reference to the taking over of the Westchester &; Port Chester Railroad securities . Mr. Whitman and Mr. Martin said yesterday that they had not yet received any documents from the Interstate Commerce Commission or the Department of Justice , but that they would be ready to act in case requests were made to prosecute any I person or set of persons . Prosecutors Would Work Together Lawyers explained that If any crimes with reference to the taking over of the Westchester Road were traceable to Wall Street , jurisdiction might lie in several counties , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr. Martin have always worked in harmony , and both said yesterday that there could be no friction if investigations were referred to them . Both Mr. Whitman and Mr. Martin are prepared on short notice to refer cases to special Grand Juries . According to one informant , there is small likelihood that any criminal investigation will be referred either to Mr. Whitman or Mr. Martin . This ' informant of Tap NEW Tema TIMES , who admitted having been in close touch with the Washington authorities , said that the investigation , if any followed at all , would be conducted entirely by the United States District Attorneys here and in New England . Mr. Whitman made this statement : " I see by the papers that a copy of the report of the Interstate Commerce Commission Is to be given to District Attorneys of other counties . As yet I have not received such a copy . The people of New York County can rest assured that if any crime has been committed in this county which is not outlawed by the Statute of Limitation ( five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons are or what their influence may be . " Attorney . General . was in town yesterday , . but declined emphatically to make any comment on the New Haven situation . United States District Attorney Marshall also was unable to throw any light upon the intentions of the Administration . When he took office , he explained , there were a certain number of cases of importance , with which he as a member of the legal firm of O'Gorman , Battle &; Marshall had been connected professionally , and it was understood that he was not to be expected to have anything to do with them in his official CapacityThe affairs of the New Haven are some of those from which he is thus barred . He was the attorney of A. H. Smithers , Chairman of the Board of the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada . who was indicted with Charles S. Mellen , President of the New Haven , and E. J. Chamberlin , President of the Grand Trunk , for a breach of the Sherman law . Although that prosecution has now fallen into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act for the Government in the present instance . He I said yesterday that he presumed if the Government decided upon action , it would be placed in the hands of Assistant Attorneys General Jesse Adkins and Gregory , who have .7 .. ndled the New Haven matters before from Washington . Mr. Marshall , being in this position , said that he had not given close attention to the report of the Interstate Commerce Commission upon the wrecking of the New Haven , and could not yesterday express ' any opinion as to the course which might be.open to the Government . . Criminal Proceedings Doubtful . The opinion was , however , expressed by others iri  --  the Federal Building that there did not seem to be any reasonable ground by which the Government could institute criminal proceedings against the Directors of the line . The most obvious thing which could be done , it was said , was for some stockholder to begin an action to recover civilly the money which the Directors had wasted . John W. H. Crim , counsel for Charles S. Mellen , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics and should not be taken seriously , and that he did not believe for a moment that any great amount of litigation or criminal prosecution would grow out of it . " To say the least , " said Mr. Crim , " the commission 's report is an eloquent denunciation of the management and the language has a peculiar melody that suggests Mr. Brandeis . " The investigation was essentially a political one , and it began as such in the Senate . It has been entirely exparte . I made no attempt to show affirmatively the facts in their true proportion . I have always been of Ole opinion that there are more appropriate forums of determining the facts in this matter than the investigation had before the Interstate Commerce Commission . " I can realize how they could write such a report from the material which they had before them , and in connection with which in hundreds of instances no effort was made by any one on behalf of all the Directors to justify their conduct . " For instance , much is said about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $417,000,000 at present . It ought to be remembered that in 1903 the New Haven owned 400 miles of read , and operated 400 more , making a total of 800 miles operated . It owns several thousand miles today . Hundreds of miles were taken over from bankrupt companies , the Central New England Railroad having been several times in receivership , and now being an enormous money earner . Trolleys Making Money . " Then they talk about the purchase of the Connecticut trolleys . They were purchasing Connecticut trolleys ten years before Mr. Mellen went to the New Haven . Of course , they had to pay well for them . People foresaw their prosperity and held them for high prices . ' But these very trolley lines earned good I dividends in 1912 and 1913 . And they are steadily increasing in value . It is not too much to say that the time will come when the trolleys will be the money-makers of the whole system . " I had rather have the trolleys than the New Haven Road itself . It would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been for the earnings of the trolleys . The earnings of the road are eaten up by terminal charges . It costs 23 cents overhead charge for every passenger who passes through the Grand Central Station . The trolleys are free from such expenses . The New Haven built many of its trolleys for local business . " I know of a. case in New England . A railroad connecting two towns charged a thirty-cent fare . and made about $3.000 a year . Mr. Mellen went up there , looked it over , and scrapped the railroad . He put in a trolley line and charged tencent fares . The following year the line showed 1,000 per cent , more profit . " If the New Haven can keep its trolleys for ten years more , they will prove a wonderful source of . income for the road . Indeed , if the attack on the railroad had not come when it did , it would have been shown that the road was not over capitalized . It would soon have been in a position to show its earning power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haven has been in securing uniform legislation from the various States through which it passes . Without such legislation a road ca n't fund its indebtedness . It must resort to shortterm notes , and that 's what kills railroads . That has been the great difficulty . B. &; M. " Hamstrung by Law . " " For instance , the State of Massachusetts has a statute forbidding the issuance of stock at less than par . When the Boston &; Maine stock got down toward par exerybody got frightened , and it went below par . It will never be possible to finance that road while that statute exists . Te road is hamstrung by the law of Massachusetts . " The politicians have always preyed upon the New Haven . It nas been the Most convenient thing to swat , . and the politicians have swatted it . That is one of the chief difficulties of this road . Politicians of all kinds , Governors . Legislatures , and municipalities in the territory occupied by it  --  seven State Governments in a territory not much bigger than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The monopoly talk is all nonsense . The New Haven does n't enjoy anything like the monopoly of the Southern Pacific in Texas , nor the Pennsylvania Railroad in Pennsylvania , Eastern Ohio , and West Virginia . And why not monopoly , if- it is properly regulated ? In the vicinity of New York the roads have agreed for years on rates and the service they shall render . All of this has been known to the Interstate Commerce Commission . " The New Haven has had to undergo what other railroads in the country could not stand . After paying dividends and earning $9,000,000 net 1n 1913 , it is not paying dividends today for two reasons . The first is business depression and the second is political muckraking . The managers and officers of the road became so demoralized that it was impossible for them to be efficient . Hundreds of its men have been constantly engaged in one sort of investigation or another for the past three Years . The demoralization of Mr. Mellen and the death of Mr. Morgan left It like a boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis Lynde Stetson denied yesterday statements attributed to Charles S. Mellen in a recent magazine article to the effect that Mr. Stetson had acted as counsel for Oakleigh Thorne and Marsden J : Perry , at ) well as for the New Haven Railroad , in the matter of the New York , Westchester &; Boston . Ile said he had never acted for Messrs . Thorne and Perry except in the particular transactions in which they were acting as agents for the New Haven , and in case of every transaction in which there was a diversity of interest he acted exclusively for the New Haven or for Messrs . J. P. Morgan &; Co. , representing the New Haven Railroad . This was in pursuance of the original understanding set forth in a letter from Mr. Stetson to Mr. Thorne , dated November 30 , 1900 , as follows : To avoid . any doubt , I should advise that this morning Mr. Mellen informed me that it was Mr. Morgan 's view , in which Mr. Rockefeller concurred , and which was adopted by Mr. Mellen. that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that . In case of any conflict in interest ( though none seemed likely ) my prior duty must always be to the New Haven Company . My continuance as counsel must , of course , be understood as involving this condition . In view of the fact that you and Mr. Perry will be acting virtually as agents of the New Haven Company , it would seem that the conditions are not essentially changed . " This is the . record referred to by Mr. Mellen in his testimony , " said Mr. Stetson . " So far as I can recall , there were only two transactions in which Messrs . Thorne and Perry had a separate and individual interest . "
