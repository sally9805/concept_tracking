HEARN came to Japan in the spring of the twenty-third year of Meiji ( 1891 ) . He immediately discontinued his business relations with the publishing-house of Harper &; Brothers . That is why he had great difficulty in earning a living after coming far away to a foreign land . He accepted a position in a school in Izumo , because Izumo was the oldest province , where many shadows of great historic events would remain . He did not mind the isolation or the inconveniences , and , as he was a bachelor , he did not care much about the salary . So he went there . Passing through a succession of villages , the traveler suddenly comes to Matsu ? , which is a very clean city , and one that surprises and astonishes the visitor . By crossing the large bridge , it is possible to obtain , toward the east , a distant view of Mt . Oyama in Hoki province , called Izumo Fuji by the natives because its shape resembles the other Fuji . The Ohashi River slowly flows in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake meet and mingle ; square white sails appear to hover above the tranquil waters . Near the shore is an islet bearing five or six pine trees , and on it is a shrine to the goddess Benten . It seemed to me that this was Hearn 's favorite view . When he first came to Matsue , he stopped for a while in a hotel in Zaimokucho , but soon hurried away to an- other place . There might have been other reasons , but the main cause of his departure was a little girl who suffered from a disease of the eyes . He thought of her with sorrow , and begged the little one 's relatives to let her go to be treated at the hospital ; but the land . lord only said , ' Yes , yes , ' and post . poned doing so indefinitely . Hearn was angered , and left the hotel with the words , ' Strange and unsympathetic man , who is without a parent 's heart ! ' Then he moved to another place , and hired a hanathashiki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever , ' said Hearn , the girl is not in the least to blame , only I am sorry for her . ' So he had the doctor treat her and cure her . He himself had weak eyes , and he always paid a great deal of attention to them . When his first son was born , he made a wish with great anxiety , saying , Come into this world with good eyes ! ' He had always a deep sympathy for those with poor eyes . At home , when Hearn saw shosei-san ( young students given homes in private families ) reading a newspaper or a book on the floor , he would say to them at once , Hold up the book when you read ! ' I married him a short time after he had moved to his new quarters from the hotel . Hearn had a peculiar temperament , and it caused me much trouble . A man moved into our neighborhood and called on him . This man had been in the same hotel in Zaimokucho , and was a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After greeting him , Hearn asked , ' Is it you who stayed at that hotel in Zaimokucho , and were a friend of the hotel-keeper 's ? ' The man answered , ' Yes , I am his friend . ' Hearn replied , ' I dislike you because you are that strange and unsympathetic fellow 's friend . Sayonara . Good-bye ! ' and left him and went inside the house . This man naturally did not understand what the trouble was , so I tried to explain , but I was very much embarrassed . We began our married life there , but suffered from many inconveniences . Early in the summer of the twenty-fourth year of Meiji ( 1892 ) , we moved over to a aamuraiestate and kept house . We moved with a maid and a pussycat . One evening in the early spring of that year , while the air was yet chill and penetrating , I was standing on the veranda admiring the sunset on the lake , when I saw , directly below the veranda along the shore , four or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and cruelly teasing her . I begged pussy of the children , brought her back to the house , and told the story to Hearn . Oh , poor puss ! ' he exclaimed . ' What cruel children they were ! ' And he held the shivering pussy right in his bosom to warm her . That time I felt a great admiration for him . After we moved to our estate , Kitabori , we missed the view of the lake , but we had left the noise of the city . At the back were a hill and the garden , and this garden was a favorite spot where we enjoyed walking about in our yukata ( light kimono for lounging ) , wearing garden clogs . The mountain pigeon coos , Te-te-pop , ! ca-ka-papa ! ' When he heard the mountain pigeon coo , Hearn used to call me to come to him . ' Do you hear that ? Is n't that delightful ? ' And he himself would imitate the sound , ? Te-te-pop , ka-ka-popt ! ? and ask , ' Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the gar- den , and we saw a snake in it . ' Snakes never harm you unless you hurt them , ' Hearn said ; and he shared his food from the table with the snake . ' I am giving you this food so that you will not eat the frogs , ' he told the snake . Then he related some of the incidents in his life . ' When I was in the West Indies , studying , the snakes would often crawl up my left arm , over my shoulders , and down my right arm . But I paid no attention to them and kept on studying . Snakes are not harmful ; they are not bad . ' We once took a trip in the province of Hoki , to a place called Lake Togo . We wished to stay there for a week , but the inn was crowded with people having a gay time , drinking and making a great deal of noise . Hearn saw them , and at once pulled my sleeve . We can not stay . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , even for a second . ' In spite of the innkeeper 's protests , and his greeting , ' Y oku irashainumh ' ta ! ( Welcome ! ) This way , please ! ' as he tried to lead the way , Hearn said , ' I do not like it ! ' and left at once . Both the innkeeper and the burnmaya were surprised . It was a noisy and common inn , and , naturally , I loathed the place , but Hearn called it jigoku . He never had the least patience with anything he disliked . I was still young then , and not used to the world , so this peculiarity of Hearn 's caused me embarrassment many times . This was Hearn 's innate temperament , and I thought it good . As I remember , it was about this same time that we visited the Kugurido near Kaga-no-ura , in the province of Izumo . This place was a grotto on an island in the sea , about two miles from the land . Hearn was extremely fond of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of or behind the boat . He took great delight in giving me an exhibition of the different strokes used in swimming . When the boat reached the cave , the noise of the waves washing against the rocks made a fearful sound , and the drops of water fell down ? ' polar ! ! potari ! ' The rowers knocked against the side of the boat with a stone ? kong ! tong ! ' This was to notify the demon that the boat was coming in . After the noise of the rock ? kong kong ! ' ? we heard a sound , chabong I chabong ! ' as if something had jumped into the water . The rowers began to tell many horrid stories , pathetic and tragic , about the spot . Hearn was going to take off his clothes , which he had put on a little while before , but the rowers said , ' Master , do not do so ! It is too dreadful to contemplate ! ' I also said , ' Do not go in swimming in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that something frightful may dwell here . ' But Hearn said , ' The water is so beautiful , so dark a blue ! The depth is unknown . It may be several million fathoms ! It would be great fun ! ' He was very anxious to go in swimming , but finally renounced the idea . He was very sulky , and , even on the following clay , he did not speak because of this disappointment . Several clays later he said to me , ' I once swam in a place where they said it was very dangerous , but I escaped without accident . Only I felt as if my body were melting away the minute I went in . I had a bad fever at once . Two of us went in at the same time . Suddenly my companion disappeared , and I noticed the tail of a big shark right in front of me . ' In 1892 , when it came the time for the summer vacation , Hearn went to visit the holy shrine of Kizuki . The day after his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , too . I went to the hotel , and found him absent ; he was bathing in the sea . His money was in a stocking anal scattered around ? silver coins and bank-notes were fall ing out . Ream was so very careless with his money that it was almost amusing . He was born that way , and had no mind for so common a thing . Only when his children were born , or when he noticed that his body was becoming weak , did he take note of the state of his finances and begin to worn about his family . It On August 37 , 1897 , we went to Tokyo from Kobe . We heard at fire that there were houses assigned to pro . fessors of the university , but we wished to live far from the university , in the suburb , and , although we hunted for a house , we could not find a good one . We received word that there was a good , spacious house in the district of lishigome , if I remember rightly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nes one story in height , and built in the old style . I imagine that it had originalh been erected for hatantoto ( a commander of the shogun 's camp ) or daimyo . The gateway looked like the gateway to a temple , and , after entering , we found that the house looked more and more like a temple . It had a large garden . with a good-sized lotus-pond . But , once inside , we noticed something very ghostly about the place , and felt strange . Ream liked it , and said , ' This is a very interesting house . ' He thought of taking it , but I could not bear to live in such a place . I learned afterward that it was haunted , and that ogres had dwelt in it . On that account the rental grew less and less , and finally it was torn down . When I told this to Hearn , he said , Why did we not go there to live ? I was sure that it was an interesting house ! ' We moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view was excellent . Hearn was particularly fond of this place . The neighboring building was a Buddhist temple called Kobudera . Hearn went about in a kimono , feeling proud and cheerful . When any of his intimate friends came to call , he took them to that interesting temple of Kobudera . And the children always thought that papa was at the temple , if he was not to be seen in the house . Many times while out walking , he said , ' Mamma-san , is it hard to sit in a temple ? Is n't there any way by which I could live in the temple ? ' I replied , ' You are not a priest , so perhaps you can not very well do so . ' ' I should prefer to be a priest , ' Hearn said ; ' and how pleased I should be if I could be one . ' ' If you should become a priest , how funny you would look with your large eyes and high nose ? a fine priest ! ' I remarked . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Kazuo our eldest son a novice . How cute he would look ! Every day we should read the scriptures and take care of the graves . That would be true happiness ! ' ' Pray that you may be born a priest in the next world ! ' ' That is my wish , ' replied Hearn . One day , as usual , we took a walk to the neighboring temple . Suddenly Hearn exclaimed , ' Oh ! oh ! ' I did not know what had happened , and was frightened . Then I saw that three large cedar trees had been cut down , and Hearn was gazing at them . ' Why did they cut down those trees ? ' ' This temple must be very poor , and they must need some money , ' I replied . ' Why did n't they tell me about it ? I can easily give a little money to help them . I should have been happier to have given them some money and saved the trees . Think how long a time was necessary for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was very downcast . ' I begin to dislike that abbot . I am sorry for him because he has no money , but I am more sorry for those trees , Mamma-san ! ' Hearn came out of the templOgate in a lifeless manner , as if some great event had taken place . He sat down in the chair in his study , and was very much depressed . ' It hurt my heart to see that sight , ' he said . ' There will be no more joy to-day . Please beg the abbot not to cut down any more trees . ' After that time he seldom visited the temple . The old abbot soon went away , and a new young abbot succeeded him . Then all the trees were cut down . When we moved away , there were no trees to be seen , the graves were gone , new tenements had been built , and the whole place changed . What Hearn had called his world of tranquillity vanished in that manner . Those three fallen trees had been the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own , even if a small one , in preference to a rented house , and I wished to build one . When I suggested this , Hearn said , ' Have you money ? ' and I answered , ' Yes , I have . ' Then he said , ' Great fun ! I will build a house in the island of Oki ' ; and when I opposed that , he added , ' We will build one in Izumo province . ' We even went in search of land , but I did not like Izumo well enough to build there , and we finally decided to buy this estate and to build additions later . Hearn always wished to live in the midst of purely Japanese surroundings , and he went to inspect the house himself . It was on the outskirts of the town and had a bamboo grove back of it , and it pleased him very much . In adding to the house , he wished to have a room where he could light a stove during the severe cold of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face the west . He had no other request , but everything must be in Japanese style ; excepting this , he made no suggestions . 346 REMINISCENCES OF LAFCADIO HEARN , If ever I happened to consult him , he would say , Well , you do as you please . I know how to write , that is all , and you , Mamma-san , know much better . ' He would pay no more attention , and if I insisted , he would add , ' I have no time ' ; and he left the entire affair to me . When that house is all ready , you might say , " Papa-san , please come to our new house in Okubo to-day . " Then I will say good-bye to this house , and will go to Okubo just as I would go to the university . That is all . ' I actually did as he requested . He disliked to lose time . This house was larger than the one in Tomihisa-cho , and at that time Okubo was more rural than it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nightingales singing in the bamboo grove at the back of the house . Hearn continued , ' It hurts my heart . ' I asked , ' Why ? ' He replied , ' It is too pleasant to last . I pray that we may live here a long time . But what do you think ? ' I used to brush out the rooms about twice every day . It was a diversion for me , but Hearn said , ' You have a mania for cleaning . ' He bated the noise of cleaning . I always cleaned the house while he was at the university , or , when he was at home , I cleaned it before he got up to breakfast . Otherwise , if I asked him to let me clean , he made me promise to do it in five or six minutes . During that time he walked around the rota ( corridor ) or in the garden . Hearn avoided society and seemed eccentric because he valued so highly things of beauty and of interest and was fond of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wept when alone by himself , and he was irritated or elated in an abnormal degree . His greatest pleasure was to live and write in the world of his imagination . That is why he was a recluse and was chary of his time , Wo n't you do something else for pleasure besides writing in your own study ? ' I would ask him . You know very well that my only diversion is to think and to write . If I have anything to write , I never get tired . When I write , I forget every . thing . Please tell me some stories , ' he would reply . I would say , ' I have told you all ; I have none to tell . ' Therefore you should go out and see or hear something interesting , and come back and tell me all about it . It never do for you just to stay at home . ' After we moved to Okubo , the house was much more spacious and the study was far from the front door and the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tranquillity without a single noise . Even then he complained that I broke his train of thought by opening the bureau drawers , so I made every effort to open the drawers more quietly . On such occasions I always remembered not to break his beautiful soap-bubble ( not to destroy his day-dreams ) . That is how I thought about it , so I never felt provoked when he scolded me . Hearn was extremely fond of ghost stories , and he used to say , ' Books of ghost stories are my treasures . ' I hunted for them fromone second-hand bookstore to another . On quiet nights , after lowering the wick of the lamp , I would begin to tell ghost stories . Hearn would ask questions with bated breath , and would listen to my tales with a terrified air . I naturally emphasized the exciting parts of the stories when I saw him so moved . At those times our house seemed as if it were haunted . I often had horrid dreams and nightmares . Hearn would say , ' We will stop talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do so . He was pleased when I told a story he liked . When I told him the old tales , I al- // ways first gave the plot roughly ; and wherever he found an interesting place , he made a note of it . Then he would ask me to give the details , and often to repeat them . If I told him the story by reading it from a book , he would say , ' There is no use of your reading it from the book . I prefer your own words and phrases ? all from your own thought . Otherwise , it wo n't do . ' So I had to assimilate the story before telling it . That made me dream . He would become so eager when I reached an interesting point of a story ! His facial expression would change and his eyes would burn intensely . This change was extraordinary . For example , take the story ' 0 Katsu San of Yurei-dake , ' in the first part of the hook , Kotto . As I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes fixed . That was not unusual , but this once I suddenly felt afraid . He sighed one long breath , and said , ' Very interesting ! ' when I finished it . He asked me to say , Alas ! blood ! ' and repeat it several times . He inquired how it had probably been said , and in what tone of voice ; what k nd of night it was , and how the wooden clogs would sound . ' I think it was in this way , ' he would say ; ' how do you think yourself ? ' and so forth , ? all of this was not at all in the book , ? and he would consult with me about it . Had any one seen us from the outside , we must have appeared like two mad people . The story of ' Yoshi-ichi ' in the first part of Kwaidan pleased Hearn exceedingly . He made that story from a very short one , with great effort and determination . He wished to make one part of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ( Open the door ) was not an emphatic enough expression for a samurai , and he made it Kainzon . ' ( This latter word means ' Open the door , ' like the former , but would be more fitting in the speaker 's mouth . ) While we were working on this story of ' Miminashi Yoshi-ichi , ' night fell , but we lighted no lamp . I went into the adjoining room , and called out in a small voice , ' Yoshi-ichil Yoshi-ichi ! ' Yes , ' Hearn answered , playing the part , I ant blind . Who are you ? ' and remained silent . In this way he worked and became absorbed in it . One day at that time , when I came home from a walk , I brought a miyaga. ( gift ) of a little clay figure , a blind musician playing a biwa ( a native four-stringed lute ) , and , without saying a word , I left it on his desk . Hearn , as soon as he noticed it , was delighted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he saw some one whom he was expecting to meet . And sometimes , when he heard during the night the swish of the bamboo leaves in the wind near his study , he would say , Ah , there goes a HeikeT And when he heard the wind , he listened to it earnestly , and said , ' That is the waves of the Dan-no-ura ! ' Perhaps I might ask him , ' Have you written that story ? ' He would reply , That story has no brother . I shall still wait for a while . Perhaps I may see a good brother coming . I might leave it in a drawer for seven years , and even then I might come across a good brother . ' This is an example of how long it sometimes took him to write one story . When the MS. ? of Ghostly Japan ? was finished , he was greatly pleased , and had it wrapped very tightly ( he was very proud of doing up the MS. securely ? sometimes he put in a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . He wrote the address neatly , and sent the MS. by registered mail . He received a cablegram saying , Good , ' and two or three days later he was dead . He looked forward eagerly to the publication of this book . A little while before his death , he said , ' I can hear the noise of the tick-tack of setting the type for Ghostly Japan . ' He was anxious to see it published , but he passed away without that gratification , and it makes me sad , even now , to think about it . III It was our custom for the three children to go upstairs and shout , ' Papa , come down ; supper is ready ! ' Hearn always replied , ' All right , sweet boys ! ' and looked so delighted , sometimes almost ( lancing about . But there were occasions when he was working so hard that even the children 's announcement would not bring any response , and they could get no answer , ' All right ! ' At such times we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dining-room . Then I would go up myself , and say , ' Papa-san , we have been waiting a long time , and all the things will taste had . I wish you would hurry up . All the children are waiting . ' Then Hearn would ask , ' What is it ? ' I would reply , ' What 's the matter with you ? This will never do ; it is dinner-time . Wo n't you take some dinner ? ' I ? Have n't I had dinner yet ? I thought I had finished it . That 's funny ! ' That is the way it would be , and I would continue , ' You had better wake up from your dream ! The tiny children will cry . ' Hearn would reply , ' Gomm ? mail Pardon me ! ' and follow me to the dining-room . On such occasions he was funny or absent-minded ; he would forget to divide the bread with the children , and would say ' No , ' and begin to eat fast . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself and say , ' Pardon ! Pardon ! did n't I give you any ? ' and begin to cut the bread . While cutting it , he would lose himself again , and eat the piece himself . Before meals he took a little whiskey , but later wine was suggested on account of his health . When absent-minded he often mistook the whiskey for the seine and poured it into a glass to drink , or put salt in his coffee ; and when the children drew his attention to it he would say , ' Really ! Is n't Papa stir pid ! ' and become lost in thought again . Often I had to say to him , ' Papa-san , it is about time that I should ask you to wake up from your dream ! ' Hearn 's habitual voice was dainty , like a woman 's , and his way of laughing was also very feminine ; but sometimes he would become very energetic and excited in a dainty ( sic ) talk and would express himself very powerfully . Ile had two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other was uproarious. disregardful of everything . This laughter made the whole family laugh , and it was so amusing that even the mairl could not help laughing . There used to be a conch-shell on a table in the study . I brought it back as a miya0 , because it was so large , one time when I went to Enoshima with the children . Hearn blew into the shell , and it made a big noise . He was pleased , saying , ' It sounds so well because I have strong lungs . What a funny noise ! ' he added , puffing out his cheeks . We came to an agreement . Every time he wished a charcoal fire for lighting his pipe , he was to How this conch-shell . When he found no fire , he would blow and make a big noise that would vibrate in sound-waves , like ' po-teo . ' Then it was heard even in the kitchen . We would keep the house so quiet , not making the least noise , and then would come the roar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I took special care to have a charcoal fire always ready for him , but he wished to blow the shell ; so the minute he saw that the charcoal was gone , he blew delightedly . It must have been fun for him . Often we were bringing the fire , and were already near his study , when we heard him blowing . The maid used to say , laughing , ' There goes the shell ! ' One summer Hearn and I went to a dry-goods store to buy two or three go-Iota . The salesman showed us a large variety . That pleased Hearn immensely . He bought this one and that one , while I kept protesting , saying , ' There is no need of buying so many . ' Finally , he bought about thirty pieces , and astonished the clerks in the shop by saying , ' But , you see , these are only one and a half or two yen . I do so wish you to wear different kinds of gukata . Only to see them on you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he would act when he liked anything . While reading a local newspaper , I noticed an article about an aged peer who loathed Western fashions and liked everything Japanese . The maids in his house had the obi ( girdle ) tied in just such a way , the coiffure arranged in just such a way , and the kimono long and flowing in the most old-fashioned way , as at court . There were no modern lamps in the house , but old-fashioned paper lanterns ; no soap and no Western innovations . Even the daily newspaper was excluded , and the old-fashioned customs were observed by the household servants . On that account no one cared to enter his employ , and would say , ' Mappira gomen ' ( I beg to be entirely excused ) . When I read that account to Hearn he said , ' How interesting it is ! ' and he was greatly delighted . ' I simply adore a person like that ; he would be one of my best friends . I am consumed with desire to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' To this I replied , ' You may have nothing Western about you , but look at your nose ! ' And he said , ' Oh ! what can I do with my nose ? Pity me because of this , for I , Koizmni Yakumo , truly love Japan more than any Japanese . ' He disliked superficial beauty , and paid no attention to what was in vogue ; he hated anything modern , and loathed pretentious kindness . He did not believe in false teeth or artificial eyes . They are all false . ' he would say ; and disliked them all . He hated the Chris , tian missionaries as he found many dishonest people among them ; but he owned three Bibles , and told his eldest son that that was the book he must read a great deal . I often recall memories of morning-glories . When the end of autumn drew near , and the green leaves were beginning to turn yellow , there was always the last morning-glory of the season blossoming so lonesomely by itself . When Hearn saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please look at it ? What beautiful courage and what honest sentiment ! Please give it a word of praise . That dainty flower still blooms until the end . Just give it a word of praise ! ' That morning the morning-glory ceased to bloom . My mother thoughtlessly pulled off the blossom and threw it away . The following morning Hearn went over to the fence and was greatly disappointed . He said , ' Grandma 's a fine woman , but she performed a sorry deed to the morning-glory . ' One of the children made fingermarks on a newf usuma ( sliding door ) with his small , untidy hand . Hearn said , ' My child spoiled that beauty ! ' He always felt keenly against mutilating or damaging beauty of any kind . He used to teach the children that even a picture you could buy for half a penny would be valuable if it was kept a long time . Hearn used to tell me to be suspicious of people . He was exceedingly honest , and was easily fooled ; he knew this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he did . He was a very critical man . 350 REMINISCENCES OF LAFCADIO HEARN For instance , when he was doing business with publishers in foreign countries , and because he was so far away , the publisher would take the liberty of deciding the arrangement of such things as book-covers and illustrations without consulting Hearn , - who was very particular about all details . At such times Hearn was often made furiously angry . When he received a letter from the publishing-house , he would immediately write back a fierce ( sic ) answer in anger , and order it to be mailed at once ; but then I would say , Yes , ' and hold it over a mail . Two or three days afterward , when he had become calm , he would regret that he had written too severely , and would ask , Mamma-san , have you mailed that letter ? ' I would answer , ' Yes , ' and watch to see whether he really regretted it . If so , I would give him the letter . He would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the only one ! ' and would begin a new letter in a milder tone . Hearn preferred women of quiet disposition to those of lively temperament . He liked bashful , downcast eyes better than those of Westerners . Ho liked the eyes of Kwannon and Jizo ( Buddhist divinities ) . When we were having our pictures taken , he always told us to look downward , and he himself had his picture taken in that attitude . Just before our eldest boy came , he thought that children were lovely , and borrowed one and kept it in our house . At the time of our eldest son 's birth he was very pleased , although extremely anxious . He hoped that my delivery would be easy , and felt sorry for my suffering . And he said , ' On such an occasion I ought to be studying , ' and he went out to the hanarezashiki and worked . When he heard the new-born baby 's first cry , he was affected by a very queer feeling ? a feeling that he had never experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time , he could find no words , and later told me that he hail had no breath , and he often spoke of it in retrospect . He loved the baby very much . The following year he went to Yokohama alone ( his only other trip by himself had been once to Nagasaki , where he had intended to stay for a week ; but he came back after one night , saying , ' Never again ! ' ) , and returned with a great many toys . We were all surprised when we saw so many , and among them we found some for which he had paid five and ten yen . When our daughter Suzuko came , he felt that , in his old age , he would be unable to foresee the girl 's future , and he said , ' What pain is in my heart ! ' He worried over it with more sorrow than rejoicing . During his latter years he spoke of poor health ; he depended on me , was devoted to me like a baby to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Ire heard my footstep , he would say jokingly , but with great delight , ' Is that you , Mamma-san ? ' Should I be a bit late , ho would worry , thinking that the kuruma had tipped over , or that some other misfortune had befallen me . When he wished to hire a kuruma ya , his first question was , ' Does he love his wife ? ' And if my answer were in the affirmative , he would say , ' That is all right ! ' There was one person whom Hearn held in high esteem , but was greatly worried because he had such a stern expression toward his wife . Just before Hearn 's death a famous personage asked for an interview . There was , however , a man of the same name in England who had the reputation of abusing women , and Hearn thought that this person might be the one , and intended to refuse the request . Then he discovered that it was some one else and decided to meet him , but A WORD IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with any one who abused the ncak ? women or children . I can not mention them here individually , but them were many people who were once very intimate with Hearn and from whom he afterward became estranged because of these same reasons . I may name again some things that Hearn liked extremely : the west , sunsets , summer , the sea , swimming , banana trees , cryptornerias ( the sugi , the Japanese cedar ) , lonely cemeteries , insects , kwaidan ' ( ghostly tales ) , Urashima , and horai ( songs ) . The places he liked were : Martinique , Matsud , Mihono-seki , Higosaki , and Yakizu . He was fond of beefsteak and plum-pudding , and enjoyed smoking . He disliked liars , abuse of the weak , Prince Albert coats , white shirts , the city of New York , and many other things . One of his pleasures was to wear the yukata in his study and listen quietly to the voice of the locust . We often took walks together , crossing the bridge of Ochiai to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chimney of the Ochiai crematory , he would think , as he said , that he himself would soon come out as smoke from that chimney . He always liked quiet temple grounds . Had there been a temple , a very small and dilapidated building with walls overgrown with weeds , it would have been an ideal resting-place for Hcarn 's body . But such a place was hard to find quickly . His wish was to have a small tombstone invisible from the outside ? he always spoke of that .
