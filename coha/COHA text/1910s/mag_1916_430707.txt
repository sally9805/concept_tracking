 | IT is a mighty unfortunate think " said a New York business man to me the other day , that the art of landing a job has not been developed more fully than it has . You would think that with one-fifth of the workers of the land idle a good deal of the time , and therefore presumably looking for jobs , and with nearly every other man of us , from b50,000 a year men down to $10 a week clerks , nosing around for the better job ? you would think that some one would systematize and distribute broadcast the bestknown methods and manners of looking for a job . But I 've never seen such an attempt. - I came back with the answer that usually starts men talking ? a request for advice . What he told me , properly app ' . ied , would put thousands of men in jobs ? and better jobs . Tell me how to go about landing the job I want to . What is the secret of success in getting work ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me tell you a little story . A friend of mine had urged me to come and call on him , so I went the other day . My ring was answered by a blue-eyed servant girl , evidently a recent immigrant . They are n't in , ' she said . " I asked her when my friend and his wife would be in , and she answered : " I do n't know . ' " Do you expect them back to-day ? " Where did they go ? ' I asked . " I do n't know . ' " Well , ' I said , I thought you might . " Who are you . please ? ' " Oh , I 'm nobody , ' she replied , simply ; " I just work here . ' " Now , the girl 's stupidity is incidental . But it 's worth telling of for this reason : her attitude of mind was most beautifully expressed by the phrase that she coined . She was n't anybody ; she just worked there ! That , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a hundred that go looking for jobs . It is the state of mind that keeps so many job-holders from landing the new job and prevents the unemployed from getting any work at all . They are not anybody ; they just want a job . Your job-seeker may not say it in so many words , but by his very lack of aggressiveness he exhales it or somehow manages to wireless it direct to the brain of his possible employer . The first thing I would say to a man who was looking for work would be : Be somebody . Act proudly and with dignity . Do n't act as if you were asking a favor . ' " Here is an example of what I mean . A young man came into my office the other day with a letter of introduction . It set forth from a friend of mine that the bearer was young , reputable , of good family , willing to work , and undeniably honest . He had just raduated from college and did n't know what he wanted to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As I expected , I had to start the conversation myself and pry all the details of his abilities out of him . I had to dig out his strong points and particular interests he volunteered nothing . He did n't know anything about the shoe business , never took the initiative to tell me what he thought about our advertising ( everybody reads it ) . I asked him what he thought of our shoes . He had worn them recently and said he ' liked them very much . " He was pleasant , agreeable . and I knew he would be willing to work faithfully ? but I did n't want him or his kind . They never start anzythziizg . Some one had given him a letter to me ; he wanted a job he thought I could give him a " job ; " therefore he was there in my office chair , and what did I have to offer him , please ? Ye gods " Later I met his mother at a reception . She bewailed the fact that her Charlie could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What a terrible thing the war was ? it even shortened the labor demand here in the United States 1 " The real trouble lay , not in Mars , but in her Charlie 's own self . First , he had the wrong idea of what a job is . He conceived it to be something to be filled ? a pigeonhole , a desk , a chair , or , as the London clerks call it , a ' berth . ' It was a niche , in his mind , with a salary attached And if he considered himself as a salesman of his own services at all , it was simply a matter of selling his time , his presence between fixed hours , or his motions in a certain spot for a stated length of time . Whereas ? and here is the most important thing I can tell you ? he should have offered , presented , exhibited , and dangled before the eyes of me , the buyer of labor , his interest in my business . Interest in the employer 's business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employer . I assume that you are in earnest when you come looking for a job . What interests me more than anything else ? Not your abilities in general , but your abilities as far as my business is concerned . If young Charlie Briggs had looked at me with a gleam of intelligence and pulled out of his pocket some of our daily paper ads and said , I liked these all but one thing . ' etc. , do n't you suppose I would instantly take an interest in him ? Give the man your ideas of what you have found true of shoes , what you and your friends like about a shoe . If you are looking for a railway job , learn all you can about the particular railway , think about it , sleep over the thoughts , and come down to ask for a job with at least one sane , original sentence that you can deliver on the subject of railways . " It is a matter of common knowledge that a great many of the good executive positions in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean that a scientific approach of a job usually lands it . Merely to state your age , experience , and past successes will not land you many worthwhile jobs nowadays . The men who make a study of the prospective employer 's business , his particular needs , and who present some original thoughts on some phase of the business are the successful job hunters of to-day . " The reason for this , of course , is that initiative is now at a higher premium in the , business world than ever before . " " Why so ? " I asked him . And for answer he took from his desk a statement of the Department of Commerce and Labor . " One big reason is competition . There are more fellows in every kind of moneymaking game . Note this : in 1900 -- these are the latest figures available on unemployment ? there were approximately six and a half million persons out of jobs during the year . That is twenty-two per cent of the total number of workers in the United States , which was then thirty-odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other day ? he hires hundreds of men each year , most of them above twenty dollars a week ? that , in his opinion , honesty , willingness to work , and the rest of the galaxy were pretty nearly demanded of a man before he even was considered as a candidate for the modern job . ; : I give these qualities only fifty per cent all together . I count them no particular asset . They are essential , of course , but they are not what distinguish men . The other fifty per cent can be had only by the exhibition of initiative , " You have probably no idea to what pains and trouble some successful men go for the purpose of landing a job with a certain desirable firm . They literally compel a good offer . My sales chief worked on me for six months before I gave him his job . He first came to me with a carefully worked out direct-to-consumer campaign in footwear and suggested that I look it over . I was rather young then myself , and stalking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him it was good and complimented him on his initiative . Thereby he had commanded my attention . Well , I could n't place him then , but he persisted in sending me in ideas , ideas , ideas . Sometimes they would be without any word of comment . Finally he gathered them all together ? the carbon copies ? and came into my office . " ' Mr. Wilkins . ' he said , I 've been sending you a lot of ideas lately . I knour something about the shoe business . I think I can work out a lot of things that will be very valuable to you . Will you give me some data that I need to do it ? Frankly , Iam bent on getting a job with you , and I guess it is up to me to make myself necessary to your organization . ' " He even offered to come and work for nothing for a month , to prove what he meant . Veil , when he went out of my office he had my contract in his pocket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to five times what it was . But men like him are rare . " As I said , what an employer values most in a man is initiative . There is no better way of proving that you have it than by exhibiting it in your method of seeking the job . You have had training ? You have had so many years of experience ? You have been with this concern and that ? You have degrees ? Well , what of it ? It is not persuasive , it does not convince . Life 's short . Take the short cut . What can you mean to the man if you do work for him ? How will he profit by your abilities ? Make an effort to show him this , in direct application to his business , and you automatically lift yourself out of the level of competitors . " And if doing this means hard , investigating work in the public library , among technical papers , or studying of correspondence school text-books to get a working knowledge of some particular business , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land a job , the better job it will be .
