txt Steel developments in the current month will give one a better idea as to the status of the steel industry than did either December or January . In the latter two months operations of the United States Steel Corporation and the independents averaged lower than in any previous two months in more than a year past . The increase of over 000,000 tons in unfilled tonnage in December and January , was not a true barometer of future conditions . The increase was large , but at the expense of very small operations . This month operations will average between 55 and .50% of capacity , and to show an increase in unfilled orders as large as reported in the preceding two months , orders will have to increase 10,000 to 15,000 tons a day . Orders in December and January were at the rate of over 30,000 tons a day , including renewal of large contracts , so that February , in order to make a favorable comparison , will have to show an incoming business of close to maximum operating capacity of 45,000 tons a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January and February at the low record prices , and orders this month should compare favorably . The price for steel in March and the second quarter will be from *2 to $3 a ton above the December minimum , and it remains to be seen whether or not consumers are - willing to make future commitments at the higher levels . One or more of the independent mills are operating more capacity than the United States Steel Corporation , but taking the industry of the whole country , operations today must be between 55 and 6437 , .. of capacity . It remains to be seen whether the gain made in steel production will hold . Over the last eighteen months steel operations have increased on two occasions , only to fall hack again . At one time operations got up to around 80% of capacity , and predictions were made that the industry was in for a period of great activity . The improvement at that time was preceded by orders averaging close to : 50,000 tons a day , whereas since the first of December orders have not averaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to increase to allow operations much above the present level , and it . will be well into the second quarter of this year before it will be safe to forecast what is in store for the industry in 1915.
