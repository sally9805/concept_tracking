" ' he answered . ' but whatever I do . I 've got to get out of It . ' " I told Webber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get another lawyer right away and let me get out of the case . As I was leaving N gibberlie asked me to get in touch with Max D. Steuer and have him act as counsel . I called Mr. Steuer by telephone . and he said he would see Webber .
