WILLI Am DEAN HOWELLS is ( mite the most . American thing we have produced . Almost sill that one can profitably say of him distributes itself about this central magnetizing fact . Of the lessons he has taught us , no other Se01/1S half so important as the supreme value of having a home , a definitely local habitation , not to tear one 's self away frosts , to sigh for , to idealize through a mist of melancholy and Weltschmerz , but simply soul solely to live in , to live for . This part of his doctrine , more than any other , has the noble force of an eternal verily preached with striking timeliness . It , is in itself the special crown of Mr. Howells , the open secret of his democratic grandeur ; and it wins double emphasis because it had to be urged against . the sterile aesthetic cosmopolitanism of the eighteen-eighties . Both his historical importance and , one may confidently hope , his permanence are affirmed by his anchorage in a provincialism as remote from mere provinciality as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' of Royce 's Philosophy of Loyally . Moreover , the work of Mr. Howells , the most soundly representative expression of America as a spirit , is also the most broadly representative of America as a civilization . It falls in the era of the great transitions of our national life , the confusion of shifting 362ideals and mislaid ideas which led to the most American thing we have ever done ? our specialization of everything . The war is over , and Howells comes back from his Venetian consulship to watch the phenomena of reconstruction , the emergence of a more centralized political system , and the dawn of a new unity . Agriculture grows relatively less important , manufacturing relatively more so ; and thereupon begins the flux of young men and women from village to city , from farm to factory and office , and the consequent specialization of multitudes of lives .

Among women , too , a ferment is at work : they swarm through doors once closed , they begin to know something , subtle changes take place in the home , marriage itself hears questions asked of it and knows that sooner or later it must answer them .

The sense of an organic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world begins to wonder what purpose it serves , what it can possibly mean . Casting about , it begins to think it sees a purpose in unity itself . And through the confusion there crystallizes slowly the dream of a real society in which the common interests shall overthrow the conflicting ones . In a score of ways the America of 1875 was at the crossroads . And William Dean Howells was the man who was there with her to see everything . He saw ? and he understood . All these tendencies and forces ? the recital of them may be tedious , but it is certainly indispensable ? are charted in the fiction of Mr. Howells , with an amplitude and a fidelity applied elsewhere , as in the novels of Trollop : , to much narrower sectors of life , but never before in English to all the important phases in the life of a whole nation .

' And he has through all this , in addition to the notion of where we arc , t he vision of where we are going . Ills novels convey the impression of greater lapses of time than any one of them actually records , because each one of them is an inquiry into something that is about to become something else .

We clamor still for the great American novel ' ? Why , we have been reading it these thirty years and more . 11 A comment of thirty years ago , written by one of the most unflattering of critics , has at least the merit of confirming , from a hostile and derogatory point of view , this fact of Mr. Howells 's provincialism . ' Henry James , ' said Mr. George Moore in Confessions of a Young Man , ' went to France and read Tourguenieff . W. D. Howells stayed it home and read Henry James . . . . I have no doubt that at one time of his life Henry James said , I will write the moral history of America , as Tourgalica ' wrote the moral history of Russia ? he borrowed at first-hand , understanding what , he was borrowing . W. D. Howells borrowed at secondhand , and without understanding what he was borrowing . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find in them something 364 CONTEMPORARY NOVELISTS : WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS more important than their author intended to put there , leave something to be desired as accounts of literal fact . It should be evident now , for example , even if it was not in 1887 , that it was Mr. Howells , rather than Henry James , who consciously set Out to write the moral History of America . Also , Alr . Howells knew at first-hand , not , only his Tourgu6nieff and his James , but GladOs and Valdes as well . If his critical interest teas never quite so intensive in its workings as Henry James 's , it was certainly much more eclectic . Its boundaries in 1887 did in fact touch everything that we now recognize as having been at that inct important in Continental fiction and drama , with the single exception of Meredith , who seems , lamentably , to have meant nothing to I lowells . Many readers and Sonic critics could still learn a good deal about Balzac and Zola , about Dostolevski and Tolstol , from what Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century ago . But one of the principal effects of his excursions among Italian , Spanish , Russian , and French realists was greatly to intensify his appreciation of Miss Wilkins , Miss Jewett , Mrs. Cooke , Miss Mu ' free , and Mr. Cable ? American realists whose worth , like his own , is all in their provincialism ; whose breadth is , as he says , vertical instead of lateral . ' If his fiction withholds the cheap tribute of imitation , it is doubly rich in its recognition of the inimitable . His way of learning from Tourganiefl ' was not to copy Ton rgamieff , but to be as American as Tourgu6nieff was BUS-. sian . In the profoundest spiritual and moral sense , he did stay at home ; but neither physically nor intellectually can he be said to have done so . He not only understood just what he might have borrowed , whether from Continental fiction or British : he understood it too well to borrow it at all . The alleged resemblance between Howells and Henry James is a subject which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is is so superficial , and leaves room for differences so fundamental , that it becomes a point for criticism of Mr. Itowells 's critics rather than of 111r . Howells himself . But so many have conspired , both before and since George Moore , to make sure that neither great . man shall be named without the other , that it ; is actually more invidious to ignore the point than to treat it . To make au end of the matter , one may say that the similarities are most important where there is least hint of any debt. , ? that . is , where each author is writing of the New England he knows , ? and that where there is the hint of a debt : , the similarity is purely verbal and almost too insignificant to bother with . however strange it may seem , it is true that Mr. Howells , whose style has for fifty years remained limpid and lacustrine , shows after 1895 an unconscious infiltration of the abused third manner ' of Henry James . Miss Bellard 's Inspiration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its pretty sophisticated trifles some persiflage of the Henry James idiom ? for example , the parting comment by Mr. Crombie , Well , I suppose she did n't want a reason , if she had an inspiration . ' But this sort of thing is of slight avail , is in fact positively silly , when one is dealing broadly with the question of influences . ' While Henry James withdraws further and further from the America we know , into the queer world of his own intensely self-conscious art , Howells remains as objective , as regional , and as little self-conscious as all artist , can be . It is utterly true that , in the sense we have described , he stayed at home ; but the compliment CONTEMPORARY NOVELISTS : WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS 365 is to America , not to a brother author . There is assuredly nothing in all this to disturb our account of that provincialism which is the nourishing root of his greatness . Morally , it is the whole story . If we speak , as here we have had to for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ esthetics , comparative literature , the transmission of influences ,  --  we have to revise the account only so far as to say that Mr. I fowells , if he did not stay at home , went home . We find him going everywhere but to go back again ; enjoying one after another his Continental journeys , of the mind and of the body , as turnings of the road ; never forgetting that great sprawled-out provincial modern Route to which , he knew , whatever road he happened to be on must at , length lead back ; finding beauty , the beauty of self-fulfillment. , in each successive reunion between the America he had left and the American he NV as . Concretely , his books of travel , his various Italian Journeys and London Films , are better and truer records because there is no affectation in them of being anywhere except ' abroad .

III In speaking of the sacrifices with which Mr. Howells , like any one , must . pay for a , sound and wise provincialism , we have in mind first of all the penalty inherent in any choice , the mutual exclusion of opposites . It is in the nature of things that you can not be at the same time cosmopolitan and provincial : you can have everything or you can have something which shall mean everything to you , but not both . ' Phis is the inevitable penalty . And it is well for the artist . who has the courage or the sublime innocence to pay it , as we see proved in the unpretentious successes of such authors as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not well for the artist who lacks the courage or the innocence , we need seek it no further back than the pretentious failures of the Celtic Renaissance ? a movement which had its headquarters in France and its impulse from a cosmopolitan restheticisin , and which was everything else before it was Celtic . We are safe , then , while we laud Mr. Howells for giving up everything , and acquiring nothing , which could have made him less definitively cisatlantic . But there is another kind of penalty , incidental and secondary , not at all in the nature of things , which Mr. Howells also elected to pay , with damage to his work and even some risk to its lasting qualities . Seemingly in pure national self-assertiveness and a kind of fierce pride in heaping up the measure of his self-denials , he refused some things which he might fully as well have had . These minor refusals of his are made in all conscience , indeed with the finest recklessness ; but they unquestionably blemish his work as that of a rounded artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution .

' He is subtle in his notation of such realities as the two sorts of deference respectively ( Inc to the law and the church , ' and the country habit of making no comment in response to what was not a question . ' These touches are treatment , presentation at its finest , the golden blocks themselves of the structure ' ; and when Mr. Howells dispossesses them in favor of talk and still more talk , he deprives us of that which he can more abundantly afford to give than we can afford to be without . IV Unless one is in the heroic mood to require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything one happens to like , one need not he greatly disturbed by the several details about Mr. Howells that one simply can not understand . Why does it happen that , with all his coldness to technique , he instinctively warms to the most careful technicians , from Jane Austen to Hardy and Henry James ? Why , against that same coldness , should he reject Thackeray because Thackeray pleased to ' stand about in his scene , talking it over with his hands in his pockets , interrupting the action , and spoiling the illusion in which alone the truth of art resides ' ? a minor technical quiblet if ever there was one ? Why should he denounce Scott for acquiescence in the division of men into noble and ignoble , patrician and plebeian , sovereign and subject , as if it were the law of God , ' without allowance for the fact that Scott often makeshis plebeians nobler than his patricians , the subject more of a man than the sovereign ? Why , above all , should he belittle Dickens because of the occasional caricature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see t hat Dickens was on toe whole a valiant fighter in the cause of realism against an effete romanticism , precisely as 1r . Howells himself was ? The only explanation of these sophisms is that Mr. Howells loves truth ? by which he nearly always means actuality ? so much that the most trivial violation of it affronts all his sensibilities . Let an author , especially a Ifritish author , tell more truth than anything else , let him further truth in intercourse and sternly rebuke whatever tends to defeat it : all this goes for naught if , in a moment of deference to some innocent . romantic fashion now discredited , he is caught dodging realities . Why , the fellow cherishes ' shadows and illusions , ' he is very drolly sentimental and feeble ' ; Mr. Howells will have none of him . We can think of hardly any other critic of equal repute who has allowed so little that he disliked to overrule so much that he would have liked if he could have taken the trouble to see it . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does not materially reduce the deficit chargeable to Mr. Howells as critic . What does materially reduce it is , of course , his historical position and influence . Preaching realism and democracy at it time when the novel , under the sanction of Stevenson and Anthony Hope Hawkins , was trying as hard as it could to get back to Scott and Dumas , he was in the position of it man who must shout if he is to make the unwilling crowd listen , and even so can make them hear but one thing . Most of Mr. Howells 's criticism , despite its urbane moderateness of tone , is essentially controversial . lie was decrying 368 CONTEMPORARY NOVELISTS : WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS deleted material CONTE : IPORARY NOVELISTS : WILMA 1 ) EIN HOW EMS 0 ( i9 making us shall have no justice in it any longer : we shall be " distinguished . " ' V Because Mr. Howells 's love of reality is more intense and consistent than that of any other important novelist . we can think of , ? and we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible exception , ? his realism is inexpressibly more vital Ilan most realism . Of writers who explored the actualities because they distrusted or feared them , despised or did not know what to make of them , we have seen many , perhaps too many , since the turn of the century ; but Mr. Howells is not of this company . No one has done bins justice who has not seen that his love of life is his belief in life , and that it is to bins quite literally a faith . By this we do not mean that he accepts everything as it is , proposing no improvements , ? we have already seen how much courage he derives from the facts of social evolution , ? but we do mean that he sees in life itself , ever struggling to articulate consciousness and beginning to operate , all the forces that are necessary to a great society and a great art . For him , there is no need of a fiat to legislate order into society from without ; nor does he go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All things work together for good , because that is the nature of them ? even of things not in themselves good . Thus , for him , intimacy with the real stands in the room of more prerequisites to art , and is altogether more sufficient , than we commonly know it capable of . He is a generation further along in the chronology of art than such a realist as Gissing , with whom reality was a distressing makeshift for lost faith . Mr. Howells appears never to have cherished illusions . Partly beV OL , no - NO. 3cause he brought over from his early work as journalist and editor a vivid sense that life was in itself enough , and more because he was born with the probing mind that will not believe without sight where it is possible to see , he picked his way serenely through the religious disturbances of the decades when even Huxley and Arnold were spending themselves in theological controversy . He reports the disturbances , indeed , but tolerantly , indulgently , as things milder than they seemed , more ephemeral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward beyond the stresses of his time ; he looks back on struggles little more than begun . This faith in the reality which is our daily life is strikingly exemplified in everything L ? . Howells has written about the phenomena of mysticism . It was only the other day that he gave us , after a long incubation , The Leather-wood God , his record of religious imposture in a small Ohio community of the early nineteenth century . It shall not be said here that . he intended this story as a sly and subtle expose of all religion through direct physical revelation : all that the evidence warrants is the assertion that he may so have intended it , and that if so he could not have done much more to sharpen its point . Clearly it expresses his contempt . of the faith that demands a sign . And in Squire Matthew Braile , the shrewd and humorous infidel of Leatherwood , we have not only a striking individual of One of Mr. llowells 's most sympathetic types , but also the intellectual point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I do n't see what you want of a miracle more than you 've had already .

It will continue to be doubted , like it conjuror 's trick , by all who have not seen it. ; and those who see it will afterwards come to discredit their own senses .

' VI The corollary of faith is peace . And the faith of Mr. Howells in the realities of life brings to him , throughout ? the inordinate business of his career , ' a peace , a large serenity , that one instinctively thinks of in Scriptural phrases ? the peace that passeth understanding ' ; ' He that believed ' shall not make haste . ' We have seen how little friction and loss he suffered during years when the fading of supernaturalism brought a tragic unrest into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others fought , he enjoyed ; and even when he fought , as sometimes one must for opinions worth holding , it was in the jolliest fighting mood , and with a good-nature as uncompromising as the opinions .

If it were not so , how should One account ; for Llle preponderance in him of lnunor , it tranquil attribute , over wit , a restive ? We would be at some pains to distinguish this deep composure of Mr. Howells from the merely vegetative contentment of which he is rather irresponsibly accused in several quarters . To words already quoted Mr. George Moore adds , in the mood of patronizing impishness which had then become his fixed mental posture : ' I see him Mr. Howells the happy father of a CONTEMPORARY NOVELISTS : WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS 371 numerous family ; the sun is shining , the girls and boys are playing on the lawn , they come trooping in to a high tea , and there is dancing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic ; girls with white dresses and virginal looks , languid mammas , mild witticisms here , there , and everywhere ; a couple of young men , one a little cynical , the other a little overshadowed by his love ; a strong , bearded man of fifty in the background ; in a word , a Tom Robertson comedy faintly spiced with American . " Fhese are indeed the ingredients , this is a large part of the formula ? and it is a large part of America , too . What George Moore really meant was that Mr. Howells had not chosen to be turgidly frank about sex . To which the answer is that Mr. Howells had chosen not to be , for the good reason that America does not share the Continental obsession , and provides singularly little in sex to be turgidly frank about . Mr. Howells explains himself on this point in two chapters of Criticism and Fiction ; and in A Modern Instance , which contains some of his most inimitably faithful tragi-comedy of New England village life , he makes these observations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping household : The situation , scarcely conceivable to another civilization , is so common in ours , where youth commands its fate and trusts solely to itself , that it may be said to be characteristic of the New England civilization wherever it keeps its simplicity . It was not stolen or clandestine ; it would have interested every one , but would have shocked no one in the whole village if the whole village had known it ; all that a girl 's parents ordinarily exacted was that they should not be waked up . ' This is not the ignorant bliss ; it is the pax Americana that leaves youthblessedly and uniquely free from the experience of guilty love ,  --  .. a heart high-sorrowful and cloy 'd , A burning forehead , and a parching tongue . No : the equableness of Mr. Howells is something other than the languor that aspires to sit in a corner tippling tea . ' It consists of elements dynamic but under the control of knowledge and faith . Set a taut wire vibrating and touch it with the thumb-nail : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism of life is the wire left to vibrate harmoniously ; there is nothing to disturb its free play in the vast quiet space of his charity , his faith , and his self-command . The Celtic rebelliousness which he inherited gives it timbre and poignancy but not discordance ; and again and , again the rarely beautiful overtones , such as that poor defrauded woman 's cry for her lost labor , prove that it is taut , not slack . And , finally , 1 ? IIowells proves his profound calm in his most American appreciation and retention of the ardors of youth . We can not see that he wrote better about youth when he had it than latterly , with all his weight of years and honor ; or that he knows the meaning of age better in his eightieth year than in his fortieth . In his philosophy , things must always be renewed if they are to live ; the present must re-create itself out of the dead past , stud be perpetually attaining perpetual youth . Language renews itself : ' No language is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Literature renews itself : Most classics are dead . ' And life renews itself . When , in The Son of Banal Langbrith , Mr. Howells treats the problem of wealth got through the chicane of the father , and the serious question of the children 's attitude toward it , he makes an end of the whole matter by letting the sleeping dog lie , ' It came to Anther again , as it had come before , that each generation exists to itself , and is so full of its own events that those of the past can not be livingly transmitted to it ; that it divinely refuses the burden which elder sins or sorrows would lay upon it , and that it must do this perhaps as a condition of bearing its own .

The years in which she was quietly fulfilling her allotted task were , like this year , made terrible by war and the pouring out of blood ; yet she pursued her way and kept her faith , in a quietude untroubled by the great stirrings of empire abroad . It is to be feared that Mr. Howells has not known how to keep himself similarly untroubled ? for the world is smaller now , and crowded , and what hurts one hurts all . Our wish for him on New Year 's Day , when these words are written , is that he may wring from this very fact , the community of pain , a confirmation of solidarity in the world , and a hope for its eventual triumph . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , it would be that he might find somehow the way to keep on believing in America  --  his America of the soiled hands and the good heart .
