 | FIFTEEN miles from the City Hall , Philadelphia , four months ago , at North Eddystone , there was a tract of fifteen acres of land . On that tract there were a row of locust trees and three houses and barns ? stone houses and barns with wide , old , old chimneys and plastered sides . On May 8 a field general there on those fifteen acres received word : " Go ahead . " This field general , the plant engineer of the Baldwin Locomotive Works , and three assistant engineers , ran a line to the middle of those acres and drove a stake . They ran other lines , drove other stakes . And then things began to happen . A company of sappers arrived and blew the locust trees and the houses and the barns clear off the map . Almost miraculously an army of workmen had thrown up trenches , in a day or two an army vastly bigger was occupying that field and there were steam shovels puffing , pile drivers thumping , donkey engines wheezing , long armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went round that the Baldwin Company was after the world 's record for fast building . Three months went by , plus a month of rain , and now there is a building ? the Remington Arms building ? covering those fifteen acres . It is as high as a six or sevenstory office building . It is the hugest thing of its kind , it is said , under roof ? a glistening mountain range of glass and tile and steel massed in a heap that hides the town beyond . Gary , the city by the lake , rose up from the lake almost in a night . But a half dozen of Gary 's biggest buildings ? if memory serves aright ? could be packed into this building . One unit of this huge structure is big enough in floor space for a world 's series game ? big enough for a national G. 0 . P. convention ? and there are thirteen such units massed against one another under one roof that sparkles like a sea beneath the sky . And this mountain range of a building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is for rifles . There is another ? to make shrapnel . Rumor has it there is to be a third . The other ? the plant of the Eddystone Ammunition Company , a Baldwin corporation , is like a huge sea monster climbing up from the Delaware to try its legs . It is getting its footing on swamp land that nothing except drainage and concrete piles ever could steady . It will be like the Remington building in construction , and the same as the other Baldwin buildings at Eddystone ? with hollow tile sides , reinforced concrete tile roof , glass everywhere to the limit of practicability . It is different in shape . It has merely three units . And it will cover not 15.03 acres , like the Remington building , but instead 14.8 acres . Instead of having 37.72 acres of floor space throbbing with relatively small machines , it will have merely 1,296,250 square feet , which is space enough , by the way , for just about all the voters of the Progressive ticket in 1912 to assemble . Samuel Vauclain is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has broken ground for a new epoch in the history of building , shown the East a thing or two and shown the South a great deal more . He is the maker of Eddystone ; that is why he wins the pseudonym of " the Gary of Philadelphia . " Yet Mr. Vauclain 's office is not at all like Judge Gary 's . It is a yellow , inconspicuous little corner of the Baldwin offices in Philadelphia . In it one can hear the dull throbbing of not very distant pneumatic hammers in the boiler shops a few hundred feet away . But he is vice-president and general manager of the Baldwin Company , which has a capital of forty millions of dollars . He is gray , but vigorously gray . By dint of his business acumen , for the most part , an army of skilled American workmen numbering between thirty-five thousand and forty thousand ? and that means a city of a couple of hundred thousand souls ? will gradually be poured into all the empty spaces all the way from Chester to City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of swift company boats and on special trains routed over three major lines . Part of this army of workmen are already in the Baldwin shops at Eddystone ? which shops , by the way , have for months been making shells . But even in booming times the company hires at most only 19,000 in all its plants East and West . And hard times hit railway building operations hard and meant the discharge of thousands of Baldwin employees . And industrial conditions in all Philadel phia , after a fashion , can be gaged by Baldwin conditions because the Baldwin Company is the biggest in Philadelphia . All this is why Philadelphia would like a week-end off in which to immortalize Mr. Vauclain and his engineers . Mr. Vauclain had built enough locomotives for the Russian Government in years bygone to think , when the war broke out , that the Russians might permit him to make a few shells . He struck out for Europe ; he went to Russia once , then a second time . He came back and set out to build the phenomenal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words , he got , thru Morgan &; Company , contracts that warranted both new buildings at Eddystone . The Remington Company needed room ; it did not wish to duplicate its plant at Ilion , New York , or at Bridgeport , Connecticut ; and it could not build in half the time the Baldwin Company could , anyway . In their building the Remingtons will make , when going fulltilt , a million and a half rifles a year , and they are installing well ahead of schedule time machines for making the first lot of two million . For at least two years they are to occupy their building and for every rifle they make they are to pay the Baldwin Locomotive Works a premium in addition to their rental . In the second building , on the banks of the Delaware , the Eddystone Ammunition Company will make shrapnel at the rate of twenty thousand rounds a day and the United States army officer in charge will test all that goes to make up the two and a half million rounds in the first lot on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river . When the war is over and Mr. Vauclain will have proved himself perhaps one of the national heroes who will have stocked United States magazines that are not altogether yet built , the Baldwin Company will take those two huge buildings and leave the very heart of Philadelphia . The company will , in short , not only have supplied magnificent plants for two huge ammunition concerns , but it will find itself possessor , not only of a great cash profit accruing from ammunition business and from rental , but also of the largest and most complete locomotive plant in the world ? and this without cost .  | " We will , in fact , " Mr. Vauclain says , " be making ammunition in those plants at least for five years . " This is taken to mean , not that the Great War will last five years , but rather that this nation and the other nations will manage between them to keep these plants going thru all that time . This may be taken as the opinion of one very keen judge of business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned , and is running like a torrent in a direction quite new . And there are other considerations brought to mind by this , the miracle city . Some of these are of interest to business men , some are of interest to the nation at large , and some are full of the magic of speed . Ordinarily , in the usual course of things without the war , these buildings at Eddystone , like many others that have sprung into existence for the making of ammunition , would hardly have been built within ten years or so , and even tho they were started probably a year or two would have elapsed had the most energetic of contractors been building them . And yet , in spite of the phenomenal record the Baldwin Company has thus far made as builders , tho the Remington plant is in part operating this month , it will not reach maximum efficiency for fully a year . There is a very patent lesson here for the nation . Standing there in the shadow of that mountainous roof of the Remington building , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things congressional in mind : " If it takes a year and three months for an organized con cern in a new shop to reach highest efficiency in the making of rifles ; if it takes three months of actual building time for miracle makers like those at Eddystone to build a plant in which such a rifle company could set to j work , how long would it take this Government , tho a : enemy were hammering at the gates , to get appropriations , to get bids and grant contracts , to build and segoing such a plant as either of these ? " There is an answer perhaps to this question , there a lesson perhaps for all future builders , in these buildings . When the verbal order " All right ? go ahead ! " was past from Mr. Vauclain to Mr. Converse , not a single contract had been signed , not a single bid had been asked . It was not till three days later that contracts were signed . And then they were signed in revolutionary ? and certainly not in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is the essence of this operation . We have n't time to fiddle with bids . " And then Mr. Converse opened fire on a dozen great manufacturing concerns : " You will furnish us steel ? 10,263 tons of it , say , ? at this figure . " The figure was worth while , and that is why the McClintic-Marshall Company turned its whole plant facilities ? at Pittsburgh , Pottstown , Rankin and Carnegie ? to making steel for this one building , and then ? to continue this illustration ? not satisfied with that , sublet part of their task to another company . " You will furnish tiling , " Mr. Converse told another firm , and it could not furnish enough fast enough , so there  | are now four kinds of tiling in each of the thirteen units of the Remington building , and thru all the weeks that the four contractors have been supplying it each one of them has crowded the other , till all four , starting simultaneously with the unit whose completion was desired first , fairly raced down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the same with the mile of cornice used on this one building , the same with the huge down-spouts a foot and a half by two feet in size , the same with the 8555 window frames four by six feet in size , " Time , " Mr. Vauclain and his assistant reiterated over and over , " is the essence of things ? what you ca n't buy immediately , do n't buy . We 'll make it ! " But there were complexities that in measure offset these advantages . The Baldwin Company was building huge structures for twofold use . The Remington building had to have place in its plants for four bull towers , to illustrate , each ultimately to have three electric cranes , for use in hydraulic boiler riveting . And all floors , or nearly all , that the Remington Company were to use had to be installed with eye to the ultimate aim of making these buildings into boiler , machine and other kinds of Baldwin shops . Builders know what such dual planning entails . As an illustration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighting all those intermediate floors that were to be installed for the first tenant . This question was solved by the use of huge bays and by the arrangement of having two or three floors alternate with but one floor . From the builder 's point of view these are big questions in themselves . And of course there were other questions ? thousands of them ? how the huge chimney towering high in air over the heating plant , a building in itself , by the way , 600 by 80 feet , could be got up in three months ' time ; what electric current should be employed . And there were other buildings , too , outside the fifteen acres ? a dry kiln , for instance , 532 by 94 feet , which was a snug little problem . There have been a great many illustrations of the mobilization of American constructive genius come as the result of the Great War , but there is none like that at Eddystone . Where there was a futile , fifteen-acre field there is now a mountain range of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another building climbing up and up . Beside the first is the erecting shop of the Baldwin Locomotive Works with a hundred powerful engines or so , both Russian and American , in all stages of completion , waiting , it seems , for the trainloads of ammunition they will in a little while be ready to haul away . Beside the second , up or down the river goes a destroyer or a freighter loitering , as it were , within call , where soon there will be a huge ocean steamship pier , just across from the Dupont Powder Works , with liners waiting till their hatches are jammed down upon their brimming cargoes . And it is the same river , by the way , that Washington crost not much less than a century and a half ago .
