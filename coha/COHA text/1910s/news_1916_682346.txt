txt The New York Conference . On my way home yesterday a follow-member of the Now York Conference handed Me a copy of your leader . " The Helpless and the Weak and the New York Conference , " with the delighted remark : " That hits the nail on the head . " I was compelled to be absent the day the resolution was passed to which you refer , end the nearest record of the proceedings known to me lies more than a hundred miles , from where I write . But so far as I could gather , the feeling of the conference on the present situation was that of the remark I have quoted . There were a. good many allusions to the question of the hour . Without exception every one I heard was in favor of preparedness and was received with enthusiastic and apparently unanimous applause . For instance , on the crowded night of the annual " Camp Firs " there was a most incisive denunciation of that unfortunate song " I Did Not Raise My Boy to Be a Soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ' crowded session on Friday morning our presiding officer , Bishop L .. B. Wilson , well known to be anything but a militant , took occasion to speak most emphatically on loyalty to the flag and the duty of bedng ready , if need bit . 1.0 fight for it . Dr. S. Parkes Cadm nt. , hose opinions on the war are well known , lectured one evening to an audience that crowded every inch of available space . His glowing eulogy of the French nation and his humorous gibe at " Teutonic stupidity " were received with outbursts of applause that could not be mint taken , as were the other references I hard mentioned . Your article Was the first hint that came to me that there had been any expression whatever of a different opinion .
