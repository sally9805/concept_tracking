txt We are not surprised that the German Emperor , as stated in our Berlin ciisnatches in THE SUNDAY TIMES , is provoked by the annoyance caused in this country by the " turning down " of the American Exposition in his capital . He has for some years practiced great courtesy and consideration in all ways toward our country and those of its citizens who come within the range of his influence , and the recent occurrence is , so far as it goes , of quite an opposite nature . It was , however , quite what might have been expected , all things considered , and though it may be the occasion of some unpleasant feeling , most sensible Americans will think that it was not wholly undeserved . The notion of an advertising enterprise on our rivals ' doorstep , so to speak , is not exactly une that could hope to be welcomed h4r the It is none the more attractive when we recall that , as a Nation , we do everything we can , in trade and by statute , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own spirit toward German industry and conimerce is openly inhospitable . We tax their products heavily ; we interpose vexatious formalities and requirements " against all importations ; we treat the buying of German goods not strictly conformed to our harsh regulations as in the nature of crime , and pursue and punish it with the greatest severity . Why should we suppose that when we smite our German friends thus spitefully on the one cheek they will turn to us the other and give us facilities for taking away their custom in their home market ? It smacks of what they would call " Dreistigkeit " and we " cheek . " Of course it does not help matters that our German fridnds are in some degree actuated by the same spirit . Protection is a German idol as well as an American . and though the Germans do not make it such a juggernaut as we do , a certain class among them trow down to it blindly . It happens , - toe , that protection , in each country is most her oily laid upon what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany , who are the pets of the tariff there , bold the balance of power in German politics , and are particularly favored by the German Chancellor . When these pampered gentlemen took umbrage at the plan of an American Exposition in the German capital , they readilg obtained a hearing for their grievance . In that they were merely following in the footsteps of our own protected interests . We do not believe the incident will have much effect on German-American friendship on either side . Politically we are friendly enough with Germany because our interests do not conflict for the present and , are not likely to do so in the future . In trade we are not overfriendly because our interests do conflict , and threaten to do so in the future rather more than less . We are rivals to some extent in each other 's market , and , we are rivals in foreign markets . In our rivalry there is an unceasing struggle on both " sides , each trying in a rathgrnarrgw , and often stupid , fashion to put the other ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some time in the same spirit .
