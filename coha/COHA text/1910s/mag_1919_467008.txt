despite of tradition , facts arc not always stubborn things . That is to say , facts indicate tendencies rather than demonstrate truths , and so , from the point of view of a Feminist , it matters less that women should enter the parliaments of the world and pass laws than that the direction of woman 's thought should be thereby modified . This , I think , will happen . No one supposes that in any parliament women members will ever have a majority ; if they had , it would be as regrettable as the present condition where they are in an infinitely small minority . Nor do many think that women members will ever be very numerous ; this may be pessimistic , but even so the presence of a group of women in parliament is immensely important , not only bec ; - ? use they will protect the interests of women voters , but because they will brace the political consciousness of those voters . Though women 's political opportunities arc not vet great , they are certainly far greater than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the subordinate Finnish Parliament , a poor little parliament , as defenseless before the Russian Duma as was the Duma before the Czar . To-day women are eligible to the legislatures of Norway , Finland , America , Holland , Australia , Denmark , Britain , and Germany ? a field broad enough to determine within a reasonable time how far they can hope to gain the support of male voters . It is too early to answer that question with any security , because the privilege is too young ; at present there are zo women in the American state legislatures , there has been one in Congress ; Holland has one such member ; Denmark , 7 ; Britain , ; Finland , 19 ; there are women members in most of the Canadian state assemblies , and nine have been elected tothe Diet of Baden . It can not be said that this will afford anything conclusive in the way of evidence , for most of the members are picked women of considerable status ; thus they do not represent the average run of women candidates who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the average type will be cruder in mind ; it will approximate to that of the male candidate , be actuated as he is by a mixture of public spirit and personal . ambition . The action of the present members will be of a loftier kind than the one we should ultimately expect from groups of Congresswomen . A certain amount of information , or rather impression , can be gleaned from the list of candidates put up last December for the British Parliament . There were 17 . Two , Miss MacArthur and Mrs. Despard , were trade-unionists of the highest standing ; two were practised and respected leaders of the Women 's Liberal Federation ; three more , among them Miss Pankhurst , are exceedingly well known as militant suffragists ; we find also the president of the National Union of Women Teachers and a prominent university graduate . Nearly all the others were also women of standing ; it was a list singularly free from political adventure , and it is a pity that only one , the rebel leader , Countess Markievicz , was elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no opportunity yet of seeing woman at work in Parliament ; until she enters it as a group of at least twenty or thirty we shall not be able to generalize as to the effects of her presence . But , taking as a basis the speeches the candidates made and the contents of their election addresses , though it might be dangerous to generalize , it may be possible to anticipate . Notably , it is interesting to consider what the probable effect of a woman 's right to enter legislatures will have on the woman voter and through her on the family ; what influence this possihility will have on the woman voter in her relations with national life ; and what figure women legislators are likely to cut in the parliaments themselves . At present the political influence of women is not considerable in the family . One reason is that the right to vote is of recent origin ; even in the most advanced American states it has been exercised by women for less than a generation . Their political interests are not traditional . Whereas a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrat as he decides to become a lawyer or to go to sea , a woman has not until recently found herself compelled by her position as a human being to choose a political party . Often she had done so , and with the greatest sincerity , but she was pledging herself only to support ' a cause with money and activity ; she had not the faculty to support it by means of an actual force like a vote . Because of this , woman in the family has not , as a rule , taken a dose interest in political debate . The tendency of man has been to leave her out There are many reasons for this , and they are not all traceable to masculine arrogance ; many men still hold the view that politics are a necessary evil , a nasty thing , a soiling thing , and sentimentalists of that kind have quite honestly tried to wean their women away from politics , because they had erected an altogether false picture of a creature so ethereal and saintly that she must not think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean the grates . Those men mean well , but they find it difficult to make themselves understood . Other men have taken up the attitude : " Oh , leave the government alone and go and buy a hat . Here 's a check . " Yet others , of a more old-fashioned type , have practically put it , " Do n't you dare to start thinking ; you might disagree with me . " Faced by such influences , and lacking the encouraging power to vote and to sit in parliament , women were not tempted into the political field . Few came to think of politics , and this explains why most female political pioneers were spinsters ? they had not to contend with discouragement from a man . ( This does not apply to those who followed the pioneers ; married women joined them in masses , as a protest against male hegemony . ) As the married woman does not often evolve political ideas , it follows that hitherto she has not discussed politics with her male relatives . She had nothing to discuss with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , partly because she did , partly because it was more comfortable . For few men have outlived the view that a nice woman is a woman who agrees with them . The same applies to the child . Most mothers take a vigorous interest in the education of their children , and they are responsible for many of their ideas . It is women who inculcate in the child its elementary ideas of religion , morality , manners . The father seldom takes a hand until the child attains the age of twelve or thirteen ? that is to say , until the child becomes less of an emotional creature and more of an intellectual creature . It will be argued that many men delight in their little children , but if we analyze the quality of their interest we find that they treat them like kittens with which it is pleasant to play ; they seldom consider them as human beings in an elementary . state of development . Men will take seriously a Mexican Indian , yet , to a white child of ten , who is infinitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't ask questions . " ( This rudeness often hides humility ; I have a son of eight who unfortunately has developed a speculative temperament ; his questions and hypotheses lead to a metaphysical realm where Kant might wander blindly . The other day he asked me , " Why am I ? " I said I did n't know . ) The mother 's attitude is different . Whereas the father takes a sharp interest in his child of twelve or thirteen because the child is capable of intellectual ideas , she , about that time , begins to detach herself from it . That is why , perhaps , in infancy , children generally love their mother better than their father , while in youth they turn to their father , who can meet their new intellectual needs . But this is also a criticism of the mother 's influence . Whereas , during the early years , she inculcates ideas , moral and religious , she stops when the time comes for intellectual ideas because these are mainly . political ideas , for which she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment . This is the condition which , I believe , is swiftly changing , and which will change more swiftly as the exercise of political power by women and , above all , the opening to women of political careers , develop her outlook . Before she can preach a gospel to her family she must learn it , though ignorance of gospels has not always proved an impediment to preachers . Now political feeling has been growing very fast among women during the last thirty years or so ; though women who actively care for politics are still much less numerous than men of similar mind , still we have in England some powerful societies , such as the Women 's Liberal Federation , the Primrose League , the National Federation of Women Workers , who among them have many hundreds of thousand of members who are all more or less politically educated . Women have formed also a number of semi-political societies concerned with the status of churches , teachers , nurses , with temperance , purity laws , etc . In England and Canada many women citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage the study of political , social , and economic questions . They are growing fairly steadily , and doubtless have their counterpart in America . The suffrage societies , which were very strong , are nearly all maintaining their organization ; I have no doubt that the National Woman 's Party , in America , which has branches in every state , will continue its labors on political lines long after the missing vote is obtained in the Senate , and all women enfranchised under your Federal law . It follows that by degrees the proportion of women with political interests will tend to equal the proportion of men addicted to politics . Notably , when in America , as in England , a woman is standing for the legislature , she will tend to stimulate the interest of her female constituents . For a long time the sex issue must he set ; we can not , for many generations , choose between Mrs. Brown and Mr. Smith in a manner as unsexed as we do between Mr. Brown and Mr. Smith . Women feel this sex difference still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman because he thinks her a good candidate in spite of being a woman , for a long time many women will tend to vote for another woman as a demonstration of esprit de Corps . That is unavoidable , because i woman is still inferior in the state , and the persecuted must , in the words of Franklin , " hang together , or assuredly they shall hang separately . " I believe that the effects of this growing political consciousness will be considerable . They will not be very great on the men of the family , because most men are beyond argument ; the best even a man like Lincoln could hope to do was to pull over to his side the waverers and thus to obtain a majority over the stalwarts who were determined to vote against him , even if he came over to their side ; what a man will not take from Abraham Lincoln he will certainly not take from his wife , however often she may say it . Children , however , are in a different position because they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is a Socialist ? What do people do in the Senate ? " etc . The growingly political woman will tell them ; she will explain elementary political ideas , as a result of which the child will develop intellectually a little earlier than it did . I have no illusions as to the quality of these ideas ; there is no reason to think that the political women will be less crude , less stupid , less intolerant , and less smug than the political men . They may even be worse , being more passionate ; they will fill their children 's heads with atrocious political prejudices . But when it comes to heads a prejudice is better than a void , because at least prejudice leads to a political attitude , whereas the void is the natural home of passing error . This forecast is , of course , conditioned by locality as well as period . In countries where women are already politically advanced , such as New Zealand , Norway , Finland , etc. , the political influence of women will be more thorough than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclined to take a part in politics , in countries such as Spain and Italy , where a woman 's interest in politics is looked upon as an evidence of bad manners . And this kind of influence is likely to be slower in development , less in effect . But all over the world , as the right to vote and the right to sit develops , as it inevitably must , now that the women of England , Russia , and Germany are enfranchised , and that America hesitates on the brink , there is likely to be a shift in the intellectual focus of women . Up to the last thirty years or so women 's interests were hardly ever political . They did not take part in elections ; an English duchess , in the eighteenth century , did kiss a butcher to obtain his vote , but this is not exactly what is meant by political power . A sign of this withdrawal from politics is found in the fact that in the middle of the nineteenth century there were hardly any English women Radicals ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not because of its politics , but because their party meant their class , their pleasures , and their income . That was not politics , but self-defense . During the last two generations , however , a change took place . Our grandmothers began , about 1850 by an increasing interest in religious administration and foreign missions ; they passed on to an interest in the regulation of morals , which carries us to about 1870 ; the next step was the development of women 's groups interested in prohibition , women 's suffrage , local government . Briefly , they entered the political field , and when , in the ' eighties , they began to form political organizations absolutely parallel with those of the men , they had staked their claim . My own feeling is that the movement will accentuate itself ; that while they will maintain their old and natural interest in questions religious or moral , in matters affecting children , health , housing , they will travel farther into general politics . How far this will go and in what direction it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no men and that there are no women , but only majorities , the fact remains that there are majorities , that there are essential differences of mental outlook between men and women ; these differences must find expression in coming political ideas . Though it he comparatively easy to forecast the influence of political women on the family , it is not so easy to figure what it will be on national life . There isvery little to go upon . The present condition of Russia and Germany , which will certainly provide important evidence because they are large nations of various composition , prevents us to-day from drawing conclusions . In Finland and Norway the female vote is , on the whole , advanced , but I suspect that this arises from the fact that only very advanced women stand for the legislature and that the majority of Finnish and Norwegian women either abstain or vote for the moderate parties . From America also we can obtain no information until the Federal amendment discloses what women do in a general or Presidential election ; so far the American Woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it naturally had no time to take up an attitude on broad political questions . The same applies to Britain , where suffrage is too young ; it is also too partial , as no woman under thirty can vote , and it leaves out the great mass of working-girls . Probably , for that reason , it tends to be mainly conservative . Also there has not yet been time to collect British women into strictly female political groups . So far we have only a ridiculous organization called the Women 's Party , run by Mrs. and Miss Parkhurst , Miss Annie Ken-ney , and Mrs. Drummond . This organization has put up a program entirely devoted to the most vulgar forms of jingoism . It aims notably at a revengeful reduction of German mineral resources , and at the maintenance of the present alliances after the war ; there- fore it opposes the League of Nations ; it asks the government to refuse naturalization to Germans , regardless of resultant hatreds ; it apparently desires a tariff . Briefly , it is arrayed on the side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coarsest passions . It has no conception of an evolving world , no desire for the limitation of aristocratic or capitalist tyrannies , and supports a future of commercial hatred and competitive armament . The fact that out of six printed columns in its program only one and a half deal with purely feminine questions deprives it of the right to call itself a " woman 's " party . Our alleged Women 's Party is following the road to junkerdom . The future influence of these coarse thinkers on the masses will be as considerable as the present influence of the coarse men . Both will trade on passion and sensation , and both must be overthrown by love and justice . To a certain extent , bye and justice will find recruits among women . Whether they will find as many among women as among men is at present doubtful , because in political matters , where none shall survive who are incapable of moderation and fellow-feeling , if you want real , obstinate stupidity and brute cruelty , you will readily find it in a political woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is capable of enthusiasm , therefore of great hates as well as of great loves ? Rosa Luxemburg was more than Liebknecht , just as Catherine of Russia was more than Potemkin . In England , at least , apart from the old political societies , there is as yet no indication of interest in general political questions except among the labor women . The bulk of women politicians in England ? and this applies as much to the parliamentary candidates as to the voters ? tend to specialize along four main lines ? namely , the care of the child and mother , liquor , purity laws , and social reform as represented by matters affecting unemployment and housing . The present trend is , therefore , domestic , and when we consider that in nearly all the American states where women are enfranchised , liquor prohibition was put forward ; when we note that the same is valid in New Zealand , where also pensions at a rather earlier age have come in ; when we note that in Norway and Finland very liberal divorce laws have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England , and the further development in America , will he much on the same lines . That is to say , we may expect that the main influence of woman on national life will be in home affairs . It is true that there is no close correspondence between the vote the elector casts and the act which the parliament eventually passes ? from San Francisco to Congress the political tank leaks all the way . Still . it matters a good deal how this political tank was originally filled , because this determines the nature of the residue . I VOL. cxxxix 829. - 12suspect that woman 's contribution will consist mainly in block votes demanding measures such as mothers ' pensions , Puritanic laws , liens on men 's incomes , possibly better provision for the illegitimate , extended education , providing it does n't cost too much . Not a sufficient program , but that is all the program which we can at first expect from a new political class . I do not suppose that for some time the female vote will concern itself much with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in imperial affairs ; societies such as the Women 's Liberal Federation , and the various conservative associations , frequently hold meetings at which the political faith of the group is preached in regard to the affairs of the day , generally by men , sometimes by women , and always to an audience of women . These women are not an independent nucleus ; they take their politics as a baby takes its bottles , but still , they do form a nucleus of political interest ; as the franchise educates them in selecting their allegiance , and occasion ally swerving from it , they are likely to develop a greater keenness for such questions as finance , military , naval , colonial , and foreign affairs . At present they are politically blank ; generally in England Conservative women want a big navy . Liberal women a little navy , just as suspect , once upon a time , Democratic women wanted free silver and Republican women supported the Dingley hill . For to support a cause does not always mean that one believes in it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thinking about causes is often fatal to loyalty . Still . women will have to think about general questions as much as men , which is not a great deal to ask , if a streak of common sense is to run through their views . At present few women are so concerned ; here and there we find an expert , like Mrs. Sidney Webb on industrial inspection , like Mrs. Besant on India , like Miss Ida Tarbell ; we have anarchist leaders like Emma Goldman , peace propagandists like the late Baroness von Suttner , and Olive Schreiner ; now and then a woman breaks into philosophic theory , such as " Vernon Lee , " or into finance , like the late Mrs. Hetty Green . But these are single swallows , and few will deny that when women mix with men their role , while general politics arc being discussed , is either to agree with a smile of admiration , or to bristle in contradiction unsupported by fact and even by argument . In the main , they do not care , they do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason why they should , because for centuries their opinion has not been asked . Being kept out of that world , they have never realized the connection between their home life , their comfort , and , let us say , foreign policy . I do not suppose that the war will have altered this much ; woman is so used to calamity that it is quite possible that Belgian women who , fur four years , have lived under the thrall of the German kommandantur , will return peacefully to their babies and their stews , considering German rule as one of the evils such as poverty , bereavement , or pestilence , which have always come woman 's way and always will . It is easy to overrate the effects of the war ? the war has had , and will have , no Development being then assumed , I suspect that it will take place in women , not from any love of knowledge or justice , but through the source which has so long been potent in mankind ? hatred . One dislikes being beaten in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to defend one 's views , and , still more , to stifle another 's views . Most women will have to do this , because at present most women are of the conservative temperament . Now so long as there were no radicals the conservatives of this world lived in political happiness they were not compelled to think . That has , until lately , been the position of woman , for nobody cared what she thought . So she did n't , and proved a valuable conservative . But during the last forty or fifty years , first in Russia among the nihilists , then in Scandinavia among the moral reformers , a little later in England and America among the women 's rights advocates , in Germany among the social democrats , there have arisen women who thought , and nearly all turned to some form of socialism . A great many are eloquent , some are prac-. either because she belongs to the laboring class and has few desires , or because she belongs to the rich class . In England we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Anatole France says , the rich exhibit over the poor this moral superiority , that they neither beg in the street nor steal bread . But where her weakness may be is probably in the direction of honors and of power . For thousands of years we have so much encouraged woman 's vanity that self-exaltation has in many become a habit ; I am credibly told that a large proportion of the titles which have showered from the Lloyd-George government as water from a leaky bath , have been accepted by men because their wives wanted to be Lady X. And , whereas it is becoming an act of good form to refuse the Order of the British Empire , I hear of no woman who has declined to be made a Dame . As to power , I have , during this war , seen women in minor positions controlling nurses , directing wages , even running filing-rooms , and always filled with a bitter , earnest delight in controlling other women . From that point of view the woman legislator will be corruptible ; she will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women do not readily compromise ; what they think and what they want , they think and want with crystalline sharpness .

I think , in the legislatures , they will treat the president rather like a husband , say , " Yes , dear , " out loud , and , " Sha' n't , ' sotto voce . I think this an excellent thing , because none but a liar can entirely agree with a political party , but if women independents become numerous in the legislatures , it is likely that loyalty on the one side , and particularism on the other , would import a certain restlessness into the political atmosphere .

Uliit down her neck , somehow or other gets fed I suppose it is better that one should come to knowledge , intending to use it against instead of for mankind , than not come to knowledge at all . All this , I believe , will have its good effects , particularly in England and America , where , much more than on the Continent , men tend to take an interest in home affairs to the exclusion of foreign affairs . Be-cause England is an island , because America is a distant continent , their male inhabitants have never felt the foreigner so actual as did the Frenchman , the German , or the Serb , who are conscious of him all the time behind a thin frontier of bayonets . The war has made general politics more actual in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Vlachs , Czechs , and Bosniacs , with socialism and Bolsheviks , with foreign exchange and shipping capacity . None of thatHI A will die ; it will merely go to sleep , and in its sleep , toss . It will help a great deal if the general politics of the future toss in their sleep , rather than lie in a stupor , to start up now and then in cold-sweated nightmare . Woman will have her part in this drama because she is newer to the game . Woman in mankind is rather in the same position as the United States among nations . Both are Benjamins . Just as the United States , by rising as a political form only a century and a half ago , by becoming fathers of the French Revolution , and of all revolutions right down to the Bolshevik , just by having made an imaginative leap , created a modern civilization with a new theory of government , a new political morality , and a new humanity , so will woman benefit . The United States start d e on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet they inherited the culture of the world . They could take what they wanted from the legacy , and leave the rest . This they did , sometimes wisely , and thus they have become the most hopeful political force in the world , the rallying-point of internationalism , and perhaps the center of political harmony and peace toward which the troublous little atoms we call the European states will gravitate as into a political Nirvana . The political woman of the future has opportunities of that kind . She is not hampered by the old political allegiances . Such political knowledge as we possess lies before her ; she is going to learn less from experience , that dull old fool with the solemn face and the slovenly rule of thumb , than from bright young knowledge , pitiless chronicler of fact , and cold deducer of absolute conclusion . She may learn her lesson badly , but it will not quite be the master 's fault . What effect the entry of the political woman will have upon the legislatures themselves is not easy to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not necessarily apply to the political woman . The comic papers in England like to make jokes about female Members of Parliament , to print cartoons where they are shown doing fancywork or powdering their noses during the debates . I do not think that the women legislators will be as representative as all that , and I chronicle with regret the view that they will seldom powder their noses . No , the woman legislator will not become a legislator unless she has some virile quality . She will approximate to man , but I think her influence in Congress will be rather different ; she will probably import , as did Miss Rankin , a certain emotional atmosphere , which I for one think valuable in assemblies always a little inhuman . As regards the question that interests the public more ? namely , her influence on the moral tone of politics , this will depend upon the politics she finds herself in . Thus , in France , she will find herself in a parliament inclined to financial corruption ; in countries such as Spain and Portugal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sham radicals ; in America , in an assembly where financial interests juggle with the law and continually conflict with the representatives of popular morality and justice ; in England , in a Parliament where financial corruption is very slight , but where faiths can be seduced by a post of power or a lunch with a duke . The woman legislator will be influenced by the nature of her temptation , and I think she will best resist the temptation of money . The type of woman who is interested in politics does not , as a rule , care for money , either because she belongs to the laboring class and has few desires , or because she belongs to the rich class . In England we do n't bribe people ; we make them rich first , and , as Anatole France says , the rich exhibit over the poor this moral superiority , that they neither beg in the street nor steal bread . But where her weakness may lie is probably in the direction of honors and of power . For thousands of years we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in many become a habit ; I am credibly told that a large proportion of the titles which have showered from the Lloyd-George government as water from a leaky bath , have been accepted by men because their wives wanted to be Lady X.

As to power , I have , during this war , seen women in minor positions controlling nurses , directing wages , even running filing-rooms , and always filled with a bitter , earnest delight in controlling other women . From that point of view the woman legislator will be corruptible ; she will expose you if you offer her a hundred thousand dollars , but if you offer her a **32;412;TOOLONG , she may very well vote for you . That is if you make no bargain , for the art of corruption consists in not seeming to corrupt ; the born corrupter prefers to inoculate with the microbes of gratitude and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman legislator . Causes may be lost , but seldom lose their women . The result of that , in legislatures where women are at all numerous , will be the consolidation of the parties . Woman is a born party hack ; the leader she has adopted she continues to support beyond the point of confidence , because where confidence fails loyalty steps in . If she feels that soon she may see her leader too clearly , she imitates Nelson , puts up the telescope to her blind eye . If she did not do that in other relations divorces might be more numerous . But , whereas every cloud has its silver lining , every silver lining has its cloud , and I am convinced that the very extremism of woman will militate against this loyalty . Women do not readily compromise ; what they think and what they want , they think and want with crystalline sharpness . In the home they seem to compromise , but that is not so ; they give in . And when they have given in they return to the charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , and eventually get what they want from a man who has grown sick of the subject .

This is my own experience on committees , and it is borne out by the observation of bitter departmental feuds in the British civil service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schisms are likely to be strengthened by the woman legislator . This does not mean that she will not be able . Indeed , I believe that the average woman legislator will be far superior intellectually to the average male legislator , because , while women vote readily for men , men do not readily vote for women . The women who overcome male prejudice must therefore he women of unusual attainments , and so their presence in the legislatures is bound to raise the intellectual level . In general , the expansion of political interests among women is bound to profit the states where it takes place ; it will reduce the sluggishness of mind which bars progress because it is progress ; by realizing her rights in human affairs woman will be brought closer to her responsibilities . That , I think , is ideal politics ? to learn your debt to humanity , and the best way of paying it .
