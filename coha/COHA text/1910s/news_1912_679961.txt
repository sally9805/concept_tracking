txt Just as Chairman Marato was about to call to order a meeting of the Garment Workers ' Union in Columbus Hall to-night he saw an object on the floor that had the appearance of a bomb . He pointed it out to Andrew Shkulsky , a member , and told him to take it out to the street . Shkulsky picked it up and carried It out . A moment later an explosion was , heard . The garment workers trig out and found Shkulsky prostrate . His left hand had been torn off by the explosion , his right hand was mangled , and his right arm broken . In spite of his injuries he got to his feet and staggered to his home . where he fell unconscious in the doorway . ' His condition is serious . He was taken ' to the Long Branch Hospital . When the police arrived the hall was deserted . Detective Minugh says that on Friday last a boy told the police that he had seen what he thought were several bombs in the ' closet in Columbus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and came back with what looked like a bomb and which he said he had taken from the closet in the meeting room . Chief Wymbs put the bomb in a safe place and told the lad to go and get the others , as he had said there were ? two more in the closet . The boy went back , but when he reached the hall he found it closed for the night . When there was a strike at Fisher 's factory about two years ago a number of Polaks were brought from New York to take the places of the strikers , who were Italians . After the strike some of the Polaks remained In the , employ of the firm . When the strike occurred Shkulsky , Minugh said , came from New York with other Polaks , and besides getting work in the factory , opened a boarding house for the Polak workers . At the present time , the detective said , there are fifteen or twenty Polaks and about 400 Italians employed in the factory . The detective said it struck him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remove the suspicious obect when there were so many Italians in the hall . HAYWOOD AT PASSAIC . ' Takes Command of Strikers , Denouncing Peaceable Methods . William D. Haywood , who directed the strikes at Lawrence and Lowell , Mass. , recently , visited Passaic , N. J. , yesterday . He made two addresses to the striking mill operatives there and boasted that before he was through he would " put Passaic on the map and show the world what the capitalists of Passaic really are . " After several weeks the strike situation in Passaic and the neighboring towns is not such as to encourage the strikers greatly . Three mills out of several dozen are shut down . These are the New Jersey Worsted Spinning Company , at Garfield . and two plants of the Forstmann &; Hoffmann Company at Clifton and Garfield . Other mills are somewhat crippled by lack of hands , but there remain many that are running on full time . Only about 4.000 operatives are on strike , but their failure to work has thrown about an equal number out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , men and women , are idle . Haywood 's arrival was marked by enthusiasm among many of tile strikers who have wearied of the peaceable methods ordered by Boris Reinstein , who first began enrolling the workers in the Industrial Workers of the World . Haywood immediately denounced Reinstein as an impostor who had illegally used the name of the ; Industrial Workers of the World and promised his hearers that he would drive him from the field . Reinstein has contented himself with enrolling about 4,000 weavers . Haywood proposes enrolling workers of all branches and nationalities . Most of his hearers last night were Italians . Haywood promised a general strike which would cripple the whole mill business . He urged his hearers to combine as the strikers at Lawrence and Lowell did , and promised them that if they did so they could defeat the police , the militia , and the capitalists . What influence the arrival of Haywood may have had to do with it is not known , hut it vr.is remarked that few of the employes returned yesterday to three of the mills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though continuing to hold out against recognition of shop committees . It had been expected that many of the strikers would seize this offering , and there was considerable amazement on the part of the mill owners when the strikers failed to avail them ' selves of the opportunity to return to , work .
