NO one dreamed that the wedding of the Kaiser 's only daughter , the Princess Victoria Louise , to the son of the Duke of Cumberland , the dispossessed pretender to the Hanoverian throne . which occurred in the spring of 1913 , would be the last celebration of its kind which would ever take place in Berlin . Its splendor seemed to mark a new epoch in the glory of the Hohenzollerns , instead of being merely a prelude to their fall . Berlin had never seen a more magnificent wedding or more costly wedding gifts . There were the family stones of the Dukes of Brunswick , which had been confiscated by Prussia when it conquered Hanover , and had reposed in a safe in Berlin ever since . There was the diamond tiara , one of the handsomest in the world , which had been part of the dowry of the unfortunate queen Sophy Dorothy of Hanover , who had ended her days a lonely prisoner in the castle of Ahlden ? each stone in this tiara had a history of its own . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , the loss of which had so much distressed Queen Victoria when the law courts of England had decided that they must go with the Duke of Cumberland on his accession to his German kingdom ? they had been among his wedding gifts to his bride , the Princess Thyra of Denmark ; now she offered them in turn to the bride of her son . The Kaiser had consulted for months with the court jewelers over his gifts and had set aside the sum of two million marks for the wedding silver and trousseau . The jewels brought by the Tzar represented a million more . After the religious ceremony had been performed , the bride and groom took their places on a dais beside the Kaiser and Kaiserin . The  | invited guests tiled past , courtesying deeply . A splendid supper was served , at which the health of bride and groom were drunk . Then began what is called the Fackel Tans . The bride and groom , selecting each a partner , marched solemnly around the big ballroom , preceded by the principal court officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before and after making the round , the bride courtesied to the Kaiser and her partner , the groom bowed low to the Kaiserin and his . They then selected new partners , until each member of the royal family and each guest of royal or imperial rank had marched with them in turn . This gaudy dance , displaying the costume of every guest , was followed by a ceremony stranger still . There was presented to each guest a small piece of sky blue ribbon embroidered with the initials of the bride and groom . These were supposed to be bits of the bride 's garter . The ceremony , with its accompanying pageants and dances , had taken nearly six hours . The many balls , dinners , and concerts , the gala performance at the opera , the religious service of thanksgiving , the grand state ball occupied a number of days . I knew all the chief participants in this gorgeous ceremony . I had known King George and Queen Mary in London . I had served for nearly ten years as private secretary to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaisers , and William II , then Crown Prince , had been accustomed to drop in on me nearly every afternoon for tea . Alexander III had shown many unforgetable kindnesses to me , and I had known his son , the Tzar , Nicholas II , since he was a boy . One of my most amusing memories is of a time when Nicholas and I tumbled down together while dancing . Their speeches , public and private , sounded a note of friendliness and peace . The Kaiser 's protestations of amity toward his cousins of England and Russia had never been more effusive . Those among them who had premonitions of the war only a few months away looked to it to increase their power . Now that all that most of them represented has passed away , the wedding of the Princess Victoria Louise marks for us who shared their lives the ending of an epoch . Among the women of the German court , dowdy in spite of every expenditure of money , there was one brilliant figure , a stately , gracious woman , Parisian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Crown Princess of Germany . Her own wedding had been celebrated in these same rooms , with these same gorgeous ceremonies , by the same people , eight years before . As I write this , she is awaiting in Potsdam the decision of some German law court which will , or will not , separate her from her children . It is the story of this woman , who moved through the festivities of her sister-in-law 's wedding with a gay smile which hid an aching heart ? her love , her disillusionment , and her grief ? that I want to tell here . The Crown Princess of Germany is the daughter of my childhood friend , the Grand Duchess Anastasia Michaylowna , niece of Tzar Alexander II . Anastasia had been married at eighteen , by command of her parents , to Prince Frederick Francis , heir to the Grand Dukedom of Mecklenburg-Schwerin . She had not dared to rebel against this marriage , though it had been repugnant to her ; she was intensely Russian in her sympathies and did not want to marry a German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had insisted to her husband that she would not reside in Mecklonburg-Schwerin , and her favorite home was the French seaside resort , Cannes . In that vanished time before the war , I visited her there nearly every year . Anastasia had become a widow . The guests who frequented her palatial Villa Wenden were French , Russian , and English ; one seldom saw a German among them . Her unconcealed dislike for all things German had earned for her the hatred of the Kaiser , who had once advised her husband to divorce her as " not fit to occupy the position of a reigning German princess . " She was known in Cannes , as she wished to be known , only as a Russian ; she never made open reference to the fact that she had become a German citizen by her marriage . On my visits to her I saw about the Villa Wenden a lanky , brown-haired , brown-eyed girl . She was not studious ; in books she cared only for reading history . She had a talent for languages , another for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she loved best to play about the garden of the villa , or to ride or drive along the forest roads , or to lie or the warm sand of the beach . I knew this child as the Princess Cecile-Augusta-Mary , the youngest of Anastasia Michaylowna 's three children . She was a sweet , gentle , mirthful little girl , who had inherited from infancy her mother 's dislike for Germany and expressed it sometimes in ways which embarrassed her father , the Grand Duke . She had once caricatured one of the ladies of the Mecklenburg court , who complained to Berlin , and the Kaiser wrote her father an autocratic warning to watch ov. his daughter " or she might come to imitate her mother 's bad example . " When the betrothal of her elder sister , the Princes Alexandrine , to Prince Christian of Denmark , was announced to Cecile , she said .. " I also shall do like Drina and marry as enemy of Prussia and the Kaiser . " There was strong prejudice against her in Berlin and Mecklenburg , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her up : a such a way that no German prince eyes would consent to marry her . But little Cecile was not thinking abut : marriage . Her mother had kept her in schoolroom or out of doors . She had h .. no glimpses of her mother 's gay sock t mong those who flock in whiter to me French Riviera , and she had been : allow to mix freely only with her own Russian relatives . So when her mother , soon after Cecile had reached seventeen , told her the time had come to attend her first party the Princess showed more apprehension than pleasure . The lanky little girl I had seen about the Villa Wenden had become , at sevent a graceful , lovely young woman . figure had filled out to those lines which made the Russian grand duchesses far. : for their beauty , and her features had gentle loveliness . She was quite - acquainted with the world and converted . an expression of innocence and inexperence . Her first party dress was of white tulle , and the only ornament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guests at Princess Cecile first party ? a ball given at the villa of . uncle , the Grand Duke Michael of R. ' sia ? was a young man traveling incognito . His incognito was thinly veiled , for he was accompanied by the German General Von Lyncker , a friend of the Kaiser 's . On t a : evening Cecile met Frederick William . Crown Prince of Germany , for the Sr ' . time . He was twenty-one years old . His father , wishing him to see something of the world , had sent him on a journey Bordighera and had allowed him to visit Cannes to see his Russian relatives . Frederick William was used to the solemn ladies of Berlin . The attractions . of a German princess who had the grace and commanding presence of the Romanoffs and the charm and vivacity of a French woman swept him off his feet , and before he end of his short stay in Cannes he asked Cecile to marry him . Cecile , astonished , did not know what answer to make . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry , and that the person he must talk with was her mother . The Crown Prince , chagrined at this reception of his offer , went to Anastasia Michaylowna . The Grand Duchess was as much surprised as her daughter had been . Besides her own dislike for Germany , she knew the Kaiser 's hatred for her . She was confident he never would agree to such a marriage , and her pride rebelled at subjecting her daughter to his refusal . To avoid the issue , she told the Crown Prince that she could  | permit him to pay his attentions to her daughter unless he brought her the consent of his parents . Frederick William , more chagrined but also more eager , went back to Princess Cecile and repeated his proposal , and Cecile refused him . The worldly wisdom which she did not have could not have taught Cecile a surer way to strengthen his determination . It had never entered his thought that any woman in the world would refuse to marry him . He swore to her that he would win her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went to Mecklenburg . The Regent there Duke John Albert ? overwhelmed by the honor offered to his niece , promised to aid the Crown Prince 's suit . So Frederick William went on to Berlin to see his father . The Crown Prince , at twenty-one , had already incurred the displeasure of the Kaiser for his disinclination to matrimony ; the tradition of the Hohenzollerns was for early marriages in order that there might be many sons to carry on the dynasty . He told his father that he thought the time had come for him to marry , and the Kaiser , greatly pleased , began to enumerate to him the princesses with whom a match was possible . Frederick William replied that he had already found the woman , and he named Cecile of Mecklenburg . William II fell into a rage and forbade the match . I he Crown Prince replied that he would either marry Cecile or he would never marry . but that he was not at all sure that she would not refuse him . The possibility that a German princess might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kaiser , and he refused to consider the possibility of his son 's never marrying . In the discussion which followed , Frederick William wrung from his father an unwilling consent . TO appreciate what now occurred one should have been born under the autocracy of Germany or Russia . Anastasia Michaylowna had opposed the marriage for many reasons . Cecile was not sure that she liked the Crown Prince ; he was German and otherwise not wholly pleasing to her . But the Crown Prince was the greatest match in Europe ; the prospective position he offered Princess Cecile ? Queen of Prussia and Empress of Germany ? acknowledged nothing higher which could be attained by any woman . Anastasia Michaylowna , brought up in the Russian court , would have been more than human if , now that the Kaiser 's consent had been obtained , the brilliancy of the prospect offered to her daughter had not outweighed with her every other consideration . Her Russian relatives shared this feeling . Those about Princess Cecile entered instinctively into conspiracy to conquer her objections to the Crown Prince . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anastasia Michaylowna to St. Moritz , where they had gone for the Grand Duchess ' health . He had been represented to Cecile as generous , kindly , and affectionate ; his conduct confirmed these reports of him . He came in the morning bringing her favorite wild flowers , which he told her he had gathered on the mountains for her before she was awake . He was deferential , gentle , a tireless servitor of her wishes . Her uncle , the Grand Duke Nicholas Michaylowitsch , wrote to her , explaining the immense power for doing good which she would possess as Empress of Germany . Her grandfather , the aged Grand Duke Michael , pictured her to herself as a bond of union between the Russian and German empires . Cecile , as a result of these measures , fell in love with the Crown Prince as he himself and those about her made him appear to her . When he again proposed marriage to her , she accepted him , her resistance overborne by the glory of the prospect offered her and by the feelings which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seventeen-year-old I  | princess an interplay of intrigue . The Kaiser , still secretly opposed to the marriage , set the date for the wedding a year away , In his hatred of the Grand Duchess he instructed the Regent of Mecklenburg to inform Anastasia Michaylowna that she would be permitted to attend the wedding ceremony in Berlin , but must leave Berlin the day following , and thereafter she would be allowed to visit her daughter only once ? on the occasion of the christening of Cecile 's first child . He hoped that the Grand Duchess would refuse these cone di dons and that this might terminate the match . Anastasia , getting knowledge of William 's plans before they were officially announced to her , brought about a counter-arrangement by which she voluntarily separated herself for a time from her daughter , while Cecile , under charge of a Mecklenburg lady-in-waiting , met Frederick William at Florence , where they took rooms in separate hotels . PRINCESS CECILE found the first days of this companionship in Florence the happiest of her life . She drove and walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle prince , who consulted her every wish and showered her with magnificent presents . Then , as they sat one day on the steps of the old church at Fiesole , a little , dirty , mongrel dog crept toward her along the step . She put out her hand to pet it . A sudden rage seemed to seize Frederick William ; before her hand touched the dog , he dealt it a heavy kick which whirled it away . She cried out , sprang up , and gathered the whin- ' ing animal in her arms . He commanded her to put it down . She faced him angrily , i then turned away and walked swiftly to the carriage where her lady-in-waiting was . She met on the way the old peasant woman to whom the dog belonged . She poured into the woman 's hand the contents of her purse . Still carrying the dog , she got into the carriage and gave the command to drive home . Frederick William stood upon the steps of the church , staring after her , while persons around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also almost uncontrollably angry . Cecile , who had loved and petted animals from the time of her babyhood in Cannes , was deeply disturbed . She had seen , for the first time , something in her intended husband which was not in keeping with his character as she had believed it to be . In the morning she received an apologetic note from the Crown Prince . He had not wanted her , he said , to touch the dirty animal ; his act , in that way , might be construed as exaggerated affection for herself . She determined , after reflection , to construe it as that , and replied forgivingly . She confessed to her mother the doubts arousedin her by this occurrence , and Anastasia Michaylowna took ; warning . The Grand Duchess perceived that if Princess Cecile saw too much of the Crown Prince before . marriage , the match might be broken off Eleven months , by the Kaiser 's decision , were still to pass before the wedding could be celebrated . The Grand Duchess arranged her daughter 's i program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep Cecile and her future husband apart . The excuse she employed was the preparation of Princess Cecile 's trousseau , which included six dozens of underclothes of the finest nainsook and batiste , trimmed with real Valenciennes and Mechlin laces ; innumerable negligees and dainty petticoats and matinees ; furs of every kind ; and fifty gowns made at the leading dressmakers ' establishments of Paris and London . Two days before her wedding Princess Cecile made her solemn entry into Berlin . It illustrates Cecile 's character that there went with her on this triumphal journey the little mongrel dog which she had befriended at Fiesole . She entered Berlin seated at the side of the Kaiserin , in the great , golden , state coach of the Prussian kings which was used  | only on such occasions . At a state performance of the opera the same day she received the enthusiastic acclamations which welcomed her first public appearance in her new country . In the afternoon of her wedding day ? the ceremony was to take place at six o'clock ? Princess Cecile put on her bridal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myrtle . Its train was six yards in length , and the entire front of the skirt was draped with old Alencon point lace . The same wonderful lace composed the bridal veil . The ladies of her new household escorted her to a room where the Kaiserin awaited her , surrounded by all her court . Augusta Victoria herself put upon Cecile 's head the diamond crown which was used upon their wedding day by all princesses of Prussia , and fastened it with diamond hairpins . Cecile , crowned and appareled for the first time as a future queen , went suddenly to her mother and , to the surprise of all on such a formal occasion , knelt before her and asked her blessing . The Grand Duchess , strongly moved , raised her from her knees and kissed her . Then Cecile was led into the ancient chapel of Berlin within whose gray walls the marriage was solemnized . The Kaiser gave , among the splendid wedding gifts , the diamond tiara which etiquette obliged the German sovereign to present to every Hohenzollern bride ; he added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parure . The Kaiserin gave the parure of rubies and diamonds which she had received from her own mother-in-law . The Crown Prince , remembering that his bride 's favorite color was blue , gave sapphires and turquoises . The gifts of Cecile 's Russian relatives were surpassed only by the German Crown jewels . The Crown Prince , throughout the ceremony and the succeeding balls and dinners , followed his bride with enamored eyes . Cecile , believing his fervent protestations , was radiantly happy . She had made , she thought , the most brilliant marriage possible . and it was a marriage of love . Only the recollection that the Kaiser 's edict would , the next day . separate her from her mother dimmed her joy . The Grand Duchess wanted to see her daughter settled at Potsdam , but the Kaiser , in an angry interview with her , insisted upon her immediate departure , and Cecile and her mother parted in a storm of tears . Then began for the Crown Princess the happy days she had looked forward to . The Prince was kindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did not guess , as yet , that it was merely because she was new to him that he found her so attractive . She did not yet understand that he was incapable of the chivalrous and generous feelings which he had simulated in order to win her , or that in the coarseness of his mind he made no distinction between a wife and a mistress . SOMETHING pleasant and totally unforeseen , too , had happened . The Kaiser , who so hated the Grand Duchess , had been expected to hate her daughter also ; to the surprise of those about him he was attracted by her . He found her lively and amusing ; he liked to be with her and to talk with her . The Crown Prince jealously looked somewhat askance at this unexpected friendship of his father for his wife , perhaps threatening his own influence with the Kaiser , but he did not yet openly object to it . Cecile had begun to hear stories contradictory to the character of the Crown Prince as he had made her see it . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had many affairs with women . It was not merely , she learned , so that he might see something of the world that his father had sent him to Bordighera ; it was to break off an amour which had angered and alarmed the Kaiser . Cecile had found a distressing animality in her husband from the night of her marriage . She also discovered that he was cruel to his dogs and horses and brutal with his servants . She learned that he was inordinately vain and  | extravagantly and ridiculously ambitious . She tried to forgive these things . She had not fully realized yet that he was incapable of sustained affection , and that the only love which he could feel was a temporary physical infatuation . Her knowledge of that came at the end of her few months ' happiness ; she saw then that he had grown tired of her . He sneered at her display of affection for him . He refused , when she asked help of him in her inexperience of the Berlin court , to advise or help her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingratiate herself with his father , she ought to be clever enough to solve her problems for herself . He absented himself from her for days , except on formal occasions , and did not even make a pretense of explaining to her where he had been . THE time approached when the Crown Princess must undergo the travail of women . The change in her slender , graceful figure produced no consideration or tenderness toward her from her husband , but increased his indifference to her because she was no longer beautiful to him . She was surrounded by persons who were either critical of her or indifferent toward her . Her Hohenzollern relatives resented her affection for Russia and France ; they criticized her way of dressing , her tastes , her manner . Their only interest in her was that a possible heir to the German throne was about to be born . Her own attendants took their tone from them . As the time for the birth of her child approached , Cecile ? she was only nineteen ? longed inconsolably for her mother . She saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absent on his annual journey to the fjords of Norway . The Kaiserin was busy with the household cares which absorb every German housewife from the highest to the lowest . She did not dare to beg them to send for her mother , because she knew it would be useless . The Crown Princess went down into the valley of shadow in loneliness . The Berlin newspapers announced the birth of another Hohenzollern . Her husband paid no heed to the event . As soon as Cecile grew strong enough , she prevailed upon her physician to order her to St. Moritz for her health . She wrote her mother , begging her to meet her there . The Grand Duchess responded , and they took rooms at the same hotel . The Kaiser , learning they were together , telegraphed the Crown Princess to return at once to Berlin . The Crown Prince 's neglect of her had hardened Cecile 's heart , and she threw the Kaiser 's message into the wastebasket . Soon the Crown Prince appeared at St. Moritz and ordered her to return with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the command as at its substance , refused to go back until she had finished her visit with her mother . He repeated his command and struck her . She struggled with him . Her screams aroused the guests and attendants of the hotel . The Grand Duchess , hearing her daughter 's cries , rushed to her room . She found Cecile in a paroxysm of tears and the Crown Prince standing over her . Anastasia Michaylowna seized her son-in-law by the shoulders and forced him out of the room . She wrote at once to the Kaiser , demanding protection from him for her daughter against his son . The Kaiser recalled the Crown Prince and in attempted reparation permitted Cecile to finish her visit with her mother . Cecile had come to realize fully now the brutal character of her husband ; she had begun to suspect as well his essential sneakiness , his viciousness , and his mean pleasure in revenge . A bitter interview took place between them when she rejoined him in Berlin . He accused her of having deliberately falsified what had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Kaiser . Her indignant denials increased his rage . He was jealous of her popularity among the people of Berlin , who loved her because , having the  | traditions of the Romanoffs , she liked to go freely among them on the streets . He was revenging himself upon her , she found out , by slandering her to army officers and in clubs . He pictured her as selfish , intriguing , and craftily ambitious . He taunted her by pretending to be watching her for grounds against her for divorce . He succeeded in estranging the Hohenzollerns from her still further , and especially her sisters-in-law , the wives of Prince Eitel Frederick and Prince August Wilhelm , who had been jealous of her from the first . Cecile 's pride , which revolted against his misrepresentation of her , aided his meanness . Finding herself misjudged , she became defiant of what her critics might think of her . There had appeared in Paris the slit skirt . Cecile , whose gowns all came from Paris , wore among the formalities of a grand court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisters-inlaw exclaimed in horror , and Cecile was reprimanded by the Kaiserin . It had been planned , at another ball , that the royal family should appear in ancient German costumes imitated from the portraits of their ancestors . Cecile presented herself in an antique Russian dress . She replied , when they expostulated bitterly with her , that she had had Russian ancestors . The Crown Prince spoke of her loudly as " the Russian , " and it became a derisive nickname for her , used continually by all the family . To the distressing bickerings which went on continually between the Crown Princess and her husband , there began to be added money troubles . The Grand Duchess Anastasia. wildly extravagant herself , had taught her daughter nothing of the control of money . Cecile got inextricably into debt and was rescued by the Kaiser , who warned her , however , that the next time he might pay bills contracted in Berlin , but would pay none in Paris . She got in debt again in Paris , and this time her mother paid . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , added to her embarrassments . He was even more extravagant than herself . At times Frederick William 's expenditures left them nothing with which to placate the tradesmen , and the superintendent of the household finally told him that if he met his demands , he would not have enough left to be able to obtain ordinary supplies . The Crown Prince , with this source cut off . borrowed money from a friend and gave a promissory note . The friend , doubtful of the security , discounted the note at a bank . When Frederick William asked him to renew it , he replied that the matter was now out of his control and the bank would present it for collection in three days . The Crown Prince , in panic for fear his father might find out , begged help from his wife . Cecile 's love for him was dead , but she yielded to his pleadings . Under his urgings she let him take the ruby and diamond parure which had been the Kaiserin 's wedding gift to her , and he arranged to pawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would bear another child , and the Kaiser in recognition of the event planned to give her ruby bracelets to match the Kaiserin 's parure . Be instructed her head maid to obtain the jewels without letting the Crown Princess know ; he would then give them to the jewelers to be matched . The maid found the case that had contained them empty . Horrified at the loss , she first summoned the police , then notified the Kaiser . William II , unwilling to distress Cecile , ordered the loss concealed until the police had made their search . The Prussian royal jewels , by the investigation which was made , were discovered in the establishment where they had been pawned by a friend of the Crown Prince . The man was arrested and confessed his actions as a go-between . The Kaiser redeemed the jewels . He notified Cecile that they would remain thereafter in the possession of the Crown Treasurer ; she would not be permitted to have possession of them , but would be allowed to take them when she wished to wear  | them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that way for having tried to help her husband by a transaction in which she herself had received no profit . The Kaiser replied that he had already talked with the Crown Prince , who had assured him frankly that he had had nothing to do with , the affair and that Cecile had pawned the jewels in order to pay dressmakers ' bills , about which she had not wanted the Kaiser to know . Cecile , furious at this cowardly deception , refused to defend herself . She secretly left Berlin that night for Schwerin . There she saw her brother , the Grand Duke , and begged him ! to arrange a separation for her from the Cronin , Prince . The Grand Duke argued with her without avail ; he finally told her that he would do what she asked , but that she must of course understand that , in that case , she would never be allowed to see her children ' again . After giving her time for reflection upon this , he prevailed upon her to let him take her back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaiser and explained to him what actually had occurred , and the Kaiser gave Cecile back the jewels , together with the bracelets he had intended for her as a gift . He advised her , if the Crown Prince got into difficulties again , not to try to assist him but to come to him . But the breach between the Crown Princess and her husband had widened . For Cecile it was no longer a question of living with a man she did not love ; she lived now with a man whom she had begun to hate . Cecile bore to the Crown Prince in quick succession three sons . She knew he was unfaithful to her , but she knew , too , the need of . direct successors to the German throne , and she steeled herself against her strong distaste for him . He had not yet paraded his infidelities before her ; she closed her eyes to what was going on and pretended not to know . A young couple of aristocratic connections , the Count and Countess H ? , had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fond of admiration ; she was new to the Crown Prince . Frederick William called often at their house . The Count warned his wife that she was being talked about . He told the Crown Prince frankly that his visits were injuring the reputation of his ' wife . The Crown Prince paid no heed to this . The Count found Frederick William in his I wife 's boudoir , covering her hands with kisses . The men exchanged angry words . The Crown Prince , feeling secure in his rank . struck the Count across the face , and the Count ? an athlete ? ignored Frederick William 's royalty and soundly thrashed him . THE Count , dressing himself in full uniform , went to the Berlin palace and recounted to the Kaiser what he had done . William H. furious at the Count , dared not , under the circumstances , revenge the family honor . The chief necessity was that the affair should be covered up . He notified the Count and Countess that they must leave Berlin and informed the Crown Prince that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . But comment 1 and inquiry would be excited if the Crown Prince made this trip alone . William II sent for Princess Cecile and told her she must accompany her husband . Cecile rebelled . It was one thing to live with Frederick William in Berlin , where he had his own companions and his own pursuits . It would be quite another , she foresaw , to be his traveling companion on a journey for a year , during which she would not see her children . She was willing , she said , to do her share in concealing what had occurred ; she would set out with the Crown Prince , but she would part with him in Egypt and return , The Kaiser , on the horns of a dilemma , was obliged to content himself with this . It was announced that the Crown Prince and Princess were to travel . The Kaiserin , aware of the concession Cecile had made ,  | wished to be gracious . She ordered for her a complete set of German traveling clothes . They were not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resentment against the circumstances of her life she gave the dresses to her maids and told the Kaiserin what she had done . The heart of the Crown Princess of Germany had grown bitter . The slights and slurs of her German relatives , which she had endured since the day of her marriage , continually increased ; her contempt and hatred for her husband was growing ; successive betrayals of her confidence by those about her had ended by making her suspicious even of those who might otherwise have been her friends . She no longer looked for love . All that was left her was-ambition . She was playing for a great stake ; she would endure these things , and in the end she would be Empress . But she was glad , for the time being , to leave Berlin . There were farewell festivities at the Berlin palace , and the Crown Prince and Princess set out together for Egypt .  |
