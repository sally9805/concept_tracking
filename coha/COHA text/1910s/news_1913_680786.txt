txt SUNDAY TIMES ARTICLES . Suggestion That They Be Published in Book Form . I have found in the magazine part of THE SUNDAY TIMES such a constant and splendid succession of noteworthy articles that I have kept adding them tcgether until the pile has become cumbersome . I am- confident that all through the country hosts of similar readers could be found . Now , if you will pardon the possible presumption of my suggestion , could not THE TIMES select the most noteworthy of these articles and have them published in book form ? I am more thin confident that thousands upon thousands of your readers would hail such a publication with great joy . Could you not , as a test , make my suge-estion. couched in more appropriate language , and have it appear in one of : : unuay Issues , and see what a reception it would meet with ? I am very anxious that I might possess such a book and hence my , I trust , not too presumptive letter .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
