I HAVE given twenty-seven years of my life to a study of animal intelligence in the jungles of Africa . I have studied the creatures of the wild in their native state and in captivity . Facing them in combat , spying upon them from a steel cage that I erected in the jungle , enticing them into the range of my vision by planting gardens in clearings of the bush that tempted them to come and rob , sending natives through the forests to procure for me specimens alive ? I have seen animals under practically all conditions . And from this intimate study of animals I have exploded for myself many a popular myth concerning them ; also , I have learned truths wh'ch may at first seem almost more myth-like . Have animals human attributes ? What are the most intelligent animals ? What of the storied sagacity of the dog , the horse , the cat , the elephant ? What of these little crea ures whose very name often conveys to the popular mind a connotation of ridicule ? the monkeys ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost human qualities and to scoff at the ape ? What about Darwin ? What is there in the jungle to justify or to condemn him ? What of the Evolution of Man ? Is its secret in the African wilds ? The jungle of Africa is a great treasure-house for those who would gain the wealth of science . There it is that one finds those animals whose mental qualities closest approach man 's . I do not refer to dogs , nor to cats , nor to horses ; but to the anthropoid apes . Chimpanzee , gorilla , gibbon , and ourang-outang , in the order named , verge nearer to the mentality of the lower horizons of man than do any  | other animals . And , on my last expedition to the French Congo , 1 discovered a chimpanzee of a slightly higher type than any I have yet seen . Perhaps it is premature , but I believe this chimpanzee to be a new species ; it is new to the Smithsonian Institution , but the research data upon apes will have to be checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery can be officially announced . I may say , however , that the hand of this chimpanzee more closely approaches the human than any I have seen . There are no web-like tissues between the fingers and the hand is short and tapered like a woman 's . Perhaps it is a step toward what is popularly called the " Missing Link . " Let us get this conception of the " Missing Link " straight . Darwin never meant that man was descended from the ape ; he never meant that man evolved physically from the ape . Darwin was distorted by bigots , as are many scientists whose discoveries seem to shock smug and habitual thought . What Darwin taught was that there was a physical evolution up the animal scale toward the lower types of mankind . And of this the jungle gave me abundant proofs . Somewhere between the highest of the chimpanzees and the lowest of mankind there was an animal , or there were animals , with mentalities in between the ape and man . That is a " Missing Link . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical link . ANTHROPOID APES LEAD IN INTELLIGENCE CONTRARY to popular belief , dogs and horses and cats and elephants are far down the scale in animal intelligence . Leading all the animals in mental power are the anthropoid apes in the order I have named them ? chimpanzee , gorilla , gibbon and ourang . After them come the higher monkeys , called the " Old World Group , " the monkeys of Africa and Asia , the cercocebi and the guenon ; then the lower monkeys , the " New World Group , " the South American " Ringtails . " Then one finds a kind of monkey , siminoid , a transitional animal between the lemurs and true monkeys , creatures something like monkeys but more like racoons.  | And these animals are on about the same level as dogs , cows , cats , horses , lions , tigers , elephants , hippos and they all tall below the apes in the scale of intelligence . " But I have a dog that is almost human ! " someone says . It is not proper to compare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with man . Just as well compare him to a horse . There is only one way to rate the intelligence of the dog in the . animal kingdom . Compare him to his kin ? the wolf . The difference between the dog and the wolf is the amount of culture that the dog has acquired from close association with man . Even with this , which is not the dog 's own intel ligence per se , he is no higher in the scale than the monkey and is indeed lower than the anthropoid apes . Give a chim panzee the same cultural advantages of close association with man as the dog has received and the chimpanzee will elevate himself relatively higher on the scale than the dog has done . For the domesticated dog with all his culture is not as intel ligent as the chimpanzee in the savage state . I love all animals and have no wish to belittle man 's faithful com panion , the dog , but I have lived among chimpanzees , as well as among dogs , for twenty-seven years . MAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat . One must compare him with the wild felines ? with his kin . And the difference between those and the house cat is the amount of culture that the cat has absorbed from domesticity with human beings . A wild cat , for instance , will not submit to caressing ; it has no sense of gratitude . Due to its association with man , however , the cat can appreciate kindness and cruelty ; it is grateful for comfort . But that is only culture , not innate intelligence . So it is with the cow . For a true perspective of its intelligence one must compare it with the European buffalo , a savage animal that never has been domesticated . The gentleness of the cow represents the amount of culture gained from association with man . And the horse . There is nothing extant to which it can be compared . Descended from the proto-hippus , which passed through five  | horizons of life until in its present type , the horse has the prehistoric remnant of one toe instead of the five toes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The horse 's " intelligence " is but a veneer . When he runs away and joins " wild horses , " he at once shakes off the culture acquired front man , reverts to his innate wildness , and to this adds savageness and bad habits picked up when abused by man . So is the intelligence of chickens acquired in domesticity ; it is the same indeed with all the domestic animals many of whom seem so humanlike . In the jungle are animals that never had the opportunity of cultural association with man , yet for all that are utterly superior to the humanlike domestic animals with which we are all so familiar . It is a general truth that animal vegetarians , like the horse and the elephant , are on a lower plane of intelligence than meat-eaters , like the dog and the leopard . Bear in mind that these animals are far below apes and monkeys in the scale of animal intelligence . Down on these lower levels it is difficult to discern which are the more intelligent animals , for even the highest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become too fine . It is like attempting to compare a number of rubies without the aid of a glass . But in the higher levels it is possible to tell at a glance that the chimpanzee is highest of all and that the gorilla is mentally superior to an ourang . Broadly one may say that all the lower animals are gregarious save for some of the meat-eaters which lead isolated lives ; while all the higher animals are communal . Which is to say that they have vague ideas about marriage , family life , a feeble sense of right and wrong and of justice , and a slight idea of government as is evidenced by several apes abiding by the judgment of a patriarchal ape . FINDING FOOD THE PARAMOUNT PROBLEM ASSUMING that the conduct of animals in the routing of their normal life in a state of nature is the fairest basis of comparison of their mental resources , I turn to that source for evidence , which , of course , is estimated from the  | human standpoint of what constitutes intelligence . As a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am fully persuaded that nothing more clearly indicates the innate intelligence and mental possibilities of a species than its mode of life , and , so far as I can see , there is no unit of measure more constant or conspicuous than the dietary of a species . This appears to harmonize with all other phases of development , both physical and mental . It is no less true of animals than of mankind that necessity is the mother of invention and the more complex the conditions of life are , the greater the ingenuity required to sustain it . A cursory study of animal economy shows that the finding of food is the paramount problem in the life of every wild animal and the more difficult the solution of that problem the greater the demand upon the faculties of the mind and hence the greater development of them . In accord with this fact it is logical to infer that the more exacting and fastidious a species is in the selection of its dietary the more difficult it is to meet its requirement . It naturally involves a greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a greater variety of experience , both of which conduce to the higher development of the faculties involved . It is reasonable to expect that the highest ranges of animal intelligence will be found among animals whose modes of life require them as means of existence . For example , the anthropoid apes eat more fastidiously , demand better sleeping conditions ; obtain their food and their bed ; show more intelligence upon encountering hostile man , than do any other animals in the jungle . The most reliable standard by which to judge the comparative intelligence of any two species of animals is their modes of life and conduct in a state of nature , when in normal environments , upon their own resources and acting upon their own volition . Judging by such standard , the elephant is very far below the limit of animal intelligence . ELEPHANT VERSUS GORILLA I CHOOSE the elephant as an object of comparison with the higher animals , the apes , because , in the halcyon days  | of yore , when the country circus was the chief propaganda of animal love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a millennial event . Much " information " concerning him was accepted as holy writ and so has passed on to contem porary belief . But in these latter days the cruel heresy of a more enlightened civilization demands more substan tial proof of the elephant 's intelligence than current reports of stray elephants tenderly guarding lost babies , or squirting water on bow-legged tailors in revenge for a joke that the tailor 's grandfather had played on the elephant 's uncle a century or two before . The native hunters of Africa cer tainly know as much about the habits and modes of life of elephants and other animals as any school of scientists knows , and they are practically unanimous in regarding the elephant as a stupid and cowardly beast , and ranking him far below many other animals in point of intelligence . If it were not for the endless leagues of impenetrable jungle by which he is protected the elephant would be exterminated in a very short time , while many other kinds of animals survive in the most open and accessible sections of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gorilla in the locality of Fernan Vaz , in tilt French Congo , where I spent so many years . On the narrow strip of land lying between the ocean on one side and the lake of Nkami on the other , reaching from the edge of Odauba forest at one end to Fernan Vaz bar at the other , is a belt of open territory some twenty-five or thirty miles in length and varying in width from one mile to six or seven . miles . It is bounded on three sides by impassable waters and mostly covered with broad , undulating plains ; here and there are small areas of comparatively open forest of sparse growth . It is an area traversed in all directions by native roads , with scores of villages scattered all over it and populated by several hundred people , with three trading sta tions and the colonial military post , and the government tele graph line running through the entire length of it , yet here the gorilla has lived from time immemorial and still lives . Not only does he survive in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsists to a very great extent upon the resources of his human rivals . A GUERRILLA OF THE JUNGLE H ERE is an animal , strictly diurnal in habit , that prowls in broad daylight and periodically visits every village garden and plantation , destroys thousands of pineapple plants , steals chickens and still eludes the guns , traps and decoys that are always awaiting him . From time to time whole families of them are seen , but it is only on the rarest occasion that anyone ever gets within rifle range of them . There is one village that stands in the plain at least four hundred yards away from the nearest plat of bush and half a mile away from any dense jungle . A dozen times a year bands of gorillas cross that belt of plain , enter the village garden and destroy scores of pineapples and make their escape without harm . A singular fact is that they have never once been seen approaching the place and no one knows just how they manage to reach it without being discovered ; but in retreating they appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as seven at one time have made these raids . Despite the presence of soldiers and scores of natives scattered about the premises of the post , the gorillas con stantly invade the grounds , strip the leaves from scores of pineapple plants , steal the fruit , and escape often without detection . Time and again they have gone within twenty yards of the native nuts scattered about the grounds and several times within a hundred yards of headquarters , but up to the present not one of them has ever been killed nor , so far as known , seriously wounded . THE GORILLA INCREDIBLY INTELLIGENT T HIS is all accomplished by their clever tactics . Their ingenious system of scouts , pickets and signals is car ried out with such skill and precision as to defy all attempts to circumvent them . Every movement of the band appears to be directed by one in command ; but one mystery is , how he communicates his directions or his warning of danger .  | Everything is done in silence and no signal has so far been detected ; yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some definite means which all observe and understand . One favorite point at which their sentinel is often posted is the vertex of a certain tall palm , the stalk of which is well concealed from view by the foliage of other trees standing near it , and above which the palm rises a few feet . From this elevation , which can be reached with little risk of being seen , all approaches to that side of the grounds can be ob served and at the same time it is almost impossible for any one to see a gorilla among the converging leaves of the palm . But native eyes are very keen and several times the picket has been discovered ; but no one has so far been able to get within range of him or to surprise those under his charge , for the moment any one moves in that direction the whole party takes refuge in a spur of jungle that is near by . The chimpanzee is the only other animal in the forest that is capable of such tactics or that evinces such clear judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precautions a gorilla takes to safeguard his family . On these dangerous raids the young ones are left concealed in the jungle and only the adults engage in the venture , also before engaging in a battle with an enemy he invariably conducts his family to a place of safety and then returns for the combat , and unless very closely pressed or attacked he can scarcely be provoked to fight . Having placed his family beyond danger , however , he is a fierce-and reckless fighter . It is also a well authenticated fact , of which I have personally seen the evidence , that the gorilla makes a fairly comfortable bed at night by plucking soft leaves , ferns , moss , etc. , and piling them in a well chosen spot where he lies down in the same manner as a human being sleeps , while his family builds a rude bed of leaves up in the trees some distance above the ground . In this wise the father keeps guard at night while his family sleeps in comparative safety . Native genius has never yet devised a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . although countless efforts have been made by the most expert trappers and hunters in this part of Africa , and many white men have exhausted their ingenuity in the vain attempt to capture them . Hundreds of well authenticated instances of the gorilla 's foresight , prudence and tact can be cited and scores of acts of which no other wild animal was ever capable , the chimpanzee , highest of all animals , alone excepted . THE ELEPHANT 'S SMALL MENTAL CALIBER W ITH the intelligence of the anthropoid apes , contrast the elephant , popularly supposed to be so intelligent . Taking a closer view of the home life and habits of the elephant , we readily discover evidences of a low intelligence that scarcely has one redeeming quality . Almost every detail of the elephant 's conduct indicates an intelligence inferior to that of the monkeys , baboons and carnivores . His sensibilities are dull and all his mental faculties slow and irresolute . His food is the grossest and least select of that of any other land mammal and his methods of obtaining it are clumsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the elephant in his own domain are sufficient to demonstrate his mental calibre . Many of the native hunters use a little dog in hunting elephants and one of these diminutive creatures can drive an elephant in any direction it chooses without even barking at it . Ordinarily a small wooden bell or rattle is attached to the dog and by the sound of this the hunter takes his bearings . It is said that a metal bell alarms and often stampedes a herd of elephants , but the soft , deadened sound of the wooden rattle is not sufficiently alarming to startle them into a panic . Guided by the sound of this rattle and , knowing the trails of the animal , the hunter usually takes some short cut and intercepts the elephant at some point where he has to pass . Other hunters trail the elephant by his tracks into some secluded spot where he finds the animal dozing . He stealthily creeps up within a few feet of him and either pours a handful of broken pot metal , nuggets of iron ore or slugs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powder and wadded with banana leaves , into some vulnerable or vital part of the nodding beast . A single shot is rarely ever fatal at the time and the hunter often has to repeat this operation two or three times in about as many days , and in some instances the same elephant is trailed for a week before he is killed . There is no other large animal in this country that any hunter will follow into the jungle after it is wounded , and while it is true that a wounded elephant will sometimes turn upon his pursuer , he rarely shows fight as long as there is any chance to retreat . In a similar manner other hunters sometimes creep up and thrust a spear into the flank or ribs of the elephant , fol low him and repeat the act until the creature succumbs to internal bleeding . No one man ever takes such liberties with a gorilla , chimpanzee or leopard . At a certain point in the jungle one of the great elephant hunters of the Pangwe tribe lives and his favorite method of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size hung up above the trail where elephants frequently pass . The spear is weighted by large blocks of wood , weighing half a ton or so and supported by a strong vine drawn over a staunch bough of a tree . To the lower end a pole is attached so as to form a trigger . The pole projects across the trail so that , in passing , an elephant will strike his leg against it and thus release the spear which descends with such force as to go half through his body . In the course of a few years eight elephants have been killed in this manner at that one place , all apparently belonging to the same herd , which con tinues to pass that fatal spot two or three times a month and has done so for years ; yet they have not learned by experi ence the danger of that enormous death-trap hanging in plain view only a few feet higher than their heads . In a museum of natural history , where most people study zoology , a stuffed elephant may seem quite as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is relatively as far inferior to the gorilla mentally as he is physically , and his reputation for intelligence is mere fiction . It is not sus tained by his conduct at home in the jungle where , in keeping  | ith his crude modes of life , he is a mental pygmy . I recall a long conversation with an old native whom Paul du Chaillu taught to shoot more than sixty years ago and he has been a hunter ever since that time . He lived for nearly seventy years in the Fernan Vaz region . He said that , so far as he can judge , there are now as many gorillas in that territory as there were when he was a boy , and he corroborates the statement that they are much more wary and less defiant since the introduction of guns ; but he doubts their being less ferocious . When I asked his opinion as to the comparative intelligence of the two , the gorilla and the elephant , he smiled and grunted , " The gorilla is man , the elephant is beast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparative intelligence of the chimpanzee and gorilla he replied , " The chimpanzee is the white man of apes and the gorilla the black man of apes . " It was a comparison I had often heard before , and one which very clearly expressed the universal opinion among all the tribes of this region . And it shows the relative position of the intelligence of these higher animals to that of man .  |
