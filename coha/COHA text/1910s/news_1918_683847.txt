txt The eighth German " war loan " closes on Tuesday . Our third peace or Liberty Loan closes May 4 , according to the announcement , but might , close even before the German loan if the limit were reached . When Germany announced its loan and great Spring offensive the two things became associated In the minds of others than the Germans . Today it is announced that the Germans are checked before Amiens , and it may be added that they are checked still further by the buoyant opening of our loan . ' When important districts " beat the pistol " by announcing that their quota is oversubscribed before the lists are opened little remains except to add the figures and learn how much we have beaten the record . It would insure and intensify that announcement to bear in mind that there are records to beat besides our own . We must measure up to our allies , and they will take a lot of beating . We must also measure up to our records in earlier wars or expose ourselves to conviction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war which dwarfs other wars as much as a principle exceeds an isolated fact in permanent importance . When the issue was whether the Union or slavery should survive , our thirty million of people spent eight billions for the North and an unknown sum for the South . Now we have nearly fourfold the population which survived that four years ' struggle and over tenfold the wealth . In the chronicles of that time it was said that the raising by the North of $1,800,000,000 in the last year " was such a triumph " of financial strength as has never " been paralleled . " If we are to rise ' to that level now , we must take the entire twelve billion of bonds ? ! . uthorized three times over and the amount now specificalll asked for in addition . As the mat ? ter stands , we are lending to oui allies almost as much as we an spending on our account , and they an bleeding both in men and money . Ow tax burdens now are not half in pro . portion to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a mantle which amazed the world . Our work is equally cut out for u : if we measure our effort by number ( as well as by wealth . It is said that New York 's share may be half th ( loan . The entire loan would not be al ' of New York 's share if we are to do a : well as our allies . New York took of the second loan $1,413,045,800 , or ap ? proximately hair of the three billion minimum now . But that was easy , because New York was the first to wake up . Now the country is awake , and wants the bonds which It let us have before . The country may talc ( the three billions without New York ' : help . . To the first loan Now York proportion of subscribers was 35 pet cent . To the second loan our proportion was 25 per cent . Now the talk is that the subscribers outside New York may exceed the total for the country on the second loan . One sanguine prophet expects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be if our population is compared with that of our allies . The measure of our duty by wealth is equally difficult to meet . Our allies , whose soldiers have held the frontier of freedom for years , and whose navy alone protects our coasts from bombardment , have run in debt to tenfold our proportion . These comparisons are stimulating , not discouraging . But we must earn our thanks from those to whose succor we have pledged our lives , our fortunes , and our sacred honor . It would not be safe to suggest in any public place that we are going to be deadheads , or even passengers , in the enterprise of salvaging democracy and uncrowning the last of the unchosen Kings . In that enterprise we are going to beat all the arithmetics ever printed . We are going to wipe out the reproach that there is blood money in our pockets and that it took us years of deliberation to detect that this war is a holy war and that we were neutral on a moral issue .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
