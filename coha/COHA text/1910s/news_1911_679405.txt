txt It Is common In this country , and still more so in his own , to regard Mr. ARTHUR HALrourt as the champion of " Tory " or " reactionary " ideas and policies , the defender of hereditary privilege . His long term of leadership of the Conservative Party , with his family connection , has confirmed this view , for , during his leadership his party has unquestionably been stub-1 bornly obstructive to the measures the radical democratic element in the Liberal Part : ha ve pressed most urgently , and his ' family is one of the most haughtily aristocratic in the realm. ; But we .. suspect . if ? the views ' of the ' real " Tories , - the " backwoodsmen " among the peers , for example , could be had , it would be found that Mr. BALFourt is by no means in favor among them , and that his . rule is borne with such patience as they can muster , because he is the only man of anything like enough ability to guide their party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. BALFOUR on the Lords ' Veto bill , now under discussion in the House . With his usual keenness the Unionist leader ... directed the debate toward the ultimate consequences of the change in the Constitution , and brought to the front the question of the real control of the electorate over the conduct of their own affairs . He pointed out that the Government depended for its majority on the support of the Irish Nationalists , at whose demand the Veto bill was pressed , and without whom it could not have passed the Commons . He called attention to the fact that the first use to be made of the added power of the House of Commons would be to put through a bill for Irish home rule . Then he announced very clearly and earnestly that the Unionist Party would oppose to the last any measure of home rule that had not been submitted directly and substantially by itself to the judgment of the people . This , of course , is the logical outcome of the policy of the referendum which Mr. BALFOUR . adopted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it is also in strict accord with the principle he avowed years ago when Mr. CHAMBERLAIN sprang the notion of protection on the Conservative Party . He then declared that he would accept that policy only on the explicit condition that it should not be applied in legislation unless and until it had received the definite approval of the electorate . In other words , he would not consent that it should he applied by a majority elected on other issues , or on two or more issues , of which protection was but one . Plainly he had the principle of the referendum in his mind at that time , and it has become more distinct and practical with reflection and experience . As a matter of tactics this expression by Mr. BALFOUR in regard to the need of clear approval of home rule by the people has its value . It strengthens his plea for a compromise as to the Second Chamber . But it Is chiefly interesting at this moment as showing the democratic basis of the opinions of the aristocratic leader of the Conservative Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
