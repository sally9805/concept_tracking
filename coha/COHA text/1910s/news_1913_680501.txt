Tire walls were designed to shut off the cellars from the tunnel , but there was a dispute as to whether the kind selected would prove effectual under a hard test . The fire at .371 Broadway had been burning long before it was discovered at S o'clock , so that there was little hope from the start of saving the building . It was only by keeping a splay of water between it and 71 White Street that the buildings there were saved .
