The rescue fleet of steamers one by one reported at the scene , and , despite the fact that the waves were sweeping ever the stranded liner , they succeeded in taking off in their lifeboats and the Cobequid 's all the passengers and part of the crew , ninety-six in all . The Captain of rue Cobequid and eleven of his seamen decided to remain on the ship until morning , notwithstanding the wreck was breaking up . The ' Government steamer Lansdowne is standing by . Snatched from what seemed almost certain death , the survivors are snug to-night in Yarmouth . The wireless appeals for assistance which the distressed steamer first made thirty-six hourb before were answered late to-day as the doomed Royal Mail steamer was being racked to pieces on Trinity Rock , . six miles off Port Maitland . The rescue will go down in shipping annals as one of the most notable ever accomplished on the Atlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cannonading of the terrific seas that had been merciless from the time the vessel struck early yesterday . Quantities of cargo covered the waters as the lifeboats ranged alongside . The coastal steamers Westport and John L. Cann were first to get their small boats into the water , and they were followed soon by the boats of the Government steamer Lansdowne and the steamer Rappahannock . As the work of rescue Progressed the sea subsided considerably and no mishap marred the triumph over the waves . Westport First to Bring Help . Capt . of the ** found the liner on the southeast part of Trinity Ledge at 4:20 o'clock this afternoon . At the time there was a high wind and rough sea . He took off in three lifeboat loads 72 persons , including all of the passengers , the purser , several deck officers and part of the crew . The Westport stood by until 6:15 o'clock , when the Jonn L. Cann came up . The latter took off twenty-four men as the Westport was leaving for Yarmouth . The Captain and eleven men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , and the Government steamer Lansdowne remained with them . The Westport arrived at Yarmouth at 9 o'clock and the John L. Cann followed her in . The 108 persons on the Cobequid included twelve first cabin pasengers and an equal number in the second class . Mrs. W. C. Zoller and her child were the first to go over the side . Then followed Miss Marguerite and Miss Dorothy James , daughters of the late R. H. James , Mayor of St. George 's , Bermuda , and two Sisters of Charity . One by one the men were lowered to the lifeboat until only Capt . Rawson and eleven men remained on deck . Preparations had been made here to care for the shipwrecked ones , and they were given vry comfort that the city afforded . Trinity Rock , on which the Cobequid was transfixed at 5 A. M. yesterday morning , is a pinnacle of granite rising abruptly from the sea half way between this port and Brier Island , where the steamer was at first thought to have struck . The Trinity is awash at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated by a , iightship , lies ten miles outside Trinity Rock , v hile the course up the Bay of Fundy takes the vessels still further off shore . The Bay was swept by a typical Western blizzard as the Cobequid , pound from the tropics , began to feel her way toward St. John , N. B. The last of the ebb tide was running and the wind was strong from the west  --  conditions which tended to drive the steamer closer to the eastern shore than her skipper anticipated . Ship Stranded ' In Darkness . The crash came just before dawn , and a few minutes later the wireless S 0 S was flashing over the waters . The Cobequid 's operator was unable to give her location , for no one on board knew it definitely . Four hours later flood tide and the gale had driven the steamer still farther on the Rock , breaking her back and flooding the engine room . This pat out the fires and interrupted the wireless apparatus . The passengers were greatly alarmed , but the courage of Capt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them time and again . The steamer made water rapidly , and the cargo began to tear away . Throughout the day and night that followed the officers scanned the sea for passing craft , and the operator worked heroically to restore his wireless outfit . Meanwhile , steamers that had picked up the first cry for help were searching for the distressed craft . A heavy vapor caused by the action of the intense cold on the water handicapped the searchers , and it was a fisherman on the Port Maitland shore who first made out the Cobequid as the vapor rose this afternoon and revealed the liner on the dreaded Trinity . Darkness was gathering fast when the rescue began , but the boatmen from the coastal steamers knew the Rock and the surrounding shoals as well as they did their own front yards ashore , and they went at the work with perfect confidence . Less than five hours later those who had faced death for two days were being warmed and fed at the hotels here . So far as could be learned to-night none of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Sisters of Charity on the Cobequid was Sister Baptista , a native of St. John , N. B. She was for some I time in the convent at Wellesley , Mass . II Nearly All Were Frostbitten . All those aboard the Cobequid suffered greatly from the intense cold . Most of them were frostbitten and all of those who arrived late to-night showed the effects of exposure to zero weather . Benumbed with the cold and dazed by their long ordeal , few . of the rescued could give an intelligent account of their experiences to-night . One of the officers of the Cobequid said : " The ship struck Tuesday morning while we were trying to locate the lightship off the Lurcher Shoal . In the blinding snowstorm which prevailed we overshot the mark and brought up on the southeast end of Trinity Ledge . It was low tide , and later in ' the morning , as the tide rose , it forced us further and further up on the shoal . The steamer began to pound heavily ; and in a few minutes the engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , putting the lighting system and the wireless apparatus out of commission . " Immediately after the ship struck we sent out an S 0 S , which was picked up by the Cape Sable wireless station . Later , with . the engine room flooded , our operators had to depend entirely on the auxiliary storage batteries . Then the gale carried away the deck connections of the aerials . A temporary connection , which proved unreliable , was fixed up , but an hour later this , too , went by the board . Again we rigged up a connection , but the batteries were growing weaker , and we could send only a faint spark . The puny waves could not reach Cape Sable Station , only ninety miles away , but we were able to pick up the medley of messages regarding ourselves , and knew that we were ' beine searched for in vain off Brier Island , forty miles away in the position we erroneously gave before our wireless failed . Early to-day the Canadian Northern liner Royal George . outward bound from St. John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Life Belts Served Out to All . It was a day and night of terror on the Cobequid . Life belts had been served out to all on board , and when the seas began to break over the ship all hands were ordered below , where they huddled in the cabins . It was feared that the hull would part .. This morning 's daylight and the knowledge that the wireless appeals for help had been heard gave renewed hope , but the position of the ship grew more dangerous hourly . Up to noon the gale showed no signs of subsiding . The bridge , chart house , companion ways , in fact everything movable on deck , including all but four life boats were washed away . Various expedients to prevent sufferbig from cold were adopted . Fires were kindled in an iron bucket , in which holes had been cut to afford a draft . This crude utensil was used to heat water and make tea . One of the crew suffered a broken arm , but this was the only accident . The Cobequid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the seamanship of the officers and men who manned them challenged the admiration of the rescue fleet . When the Westport hove in sight the Cobequid put over a small boat in charge of Chief Officer Kirby . In it were placed nine women and children and eight male I passengers . It was a dangerous task to get the boat away , for the falls and davits were coated with ice , and it was necessary to beat the running tackle with marlin spikes to free it from the frozen surface . Two other small boats I were subsequently safely launched , and all three reached the Westport . The officers of the Cobequid are : Captain , J. Howson ; chief officer , F. W. Kirby ; second officer , W. F. Bullelt ; third officer , R. F. Powell ; purser , R. Houghton ; surgeon , W. H. Lister ; chief engineer , D. M. Douglas : second engineer . W.
