txt 6o HISTORY OF ENGLAND . Anglians had established themselves thus far , but history has little record of their achievements . King Edwin had for wife Athelburga , a daughter of King Athelbcrt of Kent . She brought with her to the North a monk , Paulinus , who had gained some inllucnce with her husband when unusual events hastened him to a decision . A messcngt r from ( ' uieleelm , ' King of Wessex , maliciously drew a dagger In the midst of his courtiers and rushed upn the king so violently that the wcalxn glazed him through the body of I ilia , a faithful Thane , vd'lu stepped in and saved his master 's life at the cost of his own . The same night , in the excitement of the murder , Ins voile gave birth to a daughter , and the angry father swore that if he had the fortune to avenge himself upon the assassin King of Wessex he would dedicate the child to her mother 's God . He marched against Cuichelm and defeated him , " killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The victory gave him the supremacy over Wessex and the greater part of Britain ; the Chronicle ( 617 ) says he " made himself lord of all Britain except Kent . " 2 He looked to the God of his wife 's religion as the author of his success , and the event had more effect than the arguments of Paulinus . Upon his return , he summoned a council at his hall at York , 3 where , recalling to mind that troubled night // and his revenge , he put the question ? ought they not to serve the God who had helped him ? They gave their answers . First , Coifi , a chief pagan priest : " No man , " he said , " has worshipped our gods more constantly than I ; but many have obtained greater favour with the king , and in honours and gifts have been preferred before me . If the gods were good for anything they would help their worshippers : let us examine this new teaching . " The motives of Coifi , freely expressed , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with something more worthy of the occasion : " Observe the flight of a sparrow through the hall , when you sit at supper , with the warm fire on the hearth and the wintry storm without . It flies out of storm and darkness at one door , and quickly disappears into storm and darkness at the other . Such is the life of man , with darkness before it and to follow . If this new doctrine brings us anything sure , I give my voice that we follow it . " Their old pagan religion has lost power with them ; priest and people find nothing to value in it . Paulinus followed , and spoke of eternal life and bliss . The heathen priest declared himself convinced , and offered himself to be the destroyer of the temple and altars at which he had ignorantly worshipped . He mounted a king 's horse , with warrior 's spear and shield ? acts in themselves defiant of their pagan religion and its gods ? rode to the chief temple of Deira at Goodmanham , twenty miles distant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and burned it down , with its altars and idols and all it contained . The king and his council declared themselves converts to the religion of Paulinus , and the people followed , as in Kent . Paulinus moved from place to place , baptizing them in multitudes ; according to one account , as many as I2,000 , along with Edwin , at the I ' . aster following . ' The conversion ( if Edwin , as of the other kings , did not rescue him from the Teutonic propensity to war . Ile made himself formidable to Penda , the heathen King of Mercia , called Penda the Strong , who was enlarging and uniting his kingdom , and also to Cadwallon , a British chief , " a worse pagan than Penda . " 2 He had attacked and annexed to his Anglian kingdom the still sur viving Welsh kingdom of Elmet in West York-shire . The heathen Anglian king and the Welsh chief allied themselves against a common danger , and Edwin was attacked and slain at the Battle of Hatfield Heath near Doncaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left under the feet of Cadwallon , who made his headquarters at York , ravaged far and wide , slaying and torturing women and children , and swearing to exterminate the English . The new religion once more fell with the king . Paulinus , who had become Bishop of York , fled by sea with Athelburga , and died Bishop of Rochester . The Northumbrians renounced the Christian religion as easily as they had adopted it . Its magical powers were found to be less PIONEER CHURCH WORK IN ENGLAND . potent than those of their old religion . It came in with a woman and was sent back with her . Woden-worship was set up again . The northern kingdom , thus deserted by the Roman mission , was soon afterwards occupied by the Irish Church . That Church , among its other Christian works , had sent a mission to the High-land Picts under an abbot named Columba , who became the founder of the northern Scottish Church ; and he and his successors the abbots of Iona , where he founded a monastery , had authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the refuge of the sons and some thanes of Athelfrith , banished by Edwin . Three of his seven sons , Eanfrith Oswald , and Oswy , reigned over Northumbria , or the northern division of it . Paganism was re-stored during a short reign of Eanfrith in Bernicia . Oswald , afterwards " St. Oswald , " suc ceeded him within a year , after defeating Penda 's ally , Cadwallon , at Denisburn , beyond the Roman Nall . Before the battle , he set up a cross for a standard , and his pagan soldiers swore to become Christians if they won ; they would serve the god who helped them . The battle-field ? taken to be an elevated plain not far from Hallington was long known as " The Heaven Field . " Cad wallon was slain , and this was the last great effort of the Britons . Oswald thus established in the kingdom , invited monks from Iona , his place of refuge in his dark ( Its , to come and teach his heathen people . Aldan , who came with a company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian zeal and piety . He was the first Bishop of Lindisfarne , called holy Island from him and others after him ; but he sought , when he could , a hermit 's life in the adjacent little island of Farne , crossing the shallows from time to time , and traversing town and country to preach to the heathen English by an interpreter , for he could not speak their language . King Oswald sometimes accom-panied lion and interpreted . Aidan 's fame comes to us through the historian of the rival Church of Rome . Ile lived as he taught , distributed to the poor whatever was given hint , and spent his life in preaching and study and works of charity . The kingdom of Oswald still reached north-ward to the Forth . On the south it was straitened by the growing power of Mercia . He reigned eight years , and fell in battle with Penda at a place called Maserfield . He was succeeded by his brother Oswy ; but the supremacy over Wessex had passed to Penda . 4 . The conversion of Wessex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ l an Italian bishop , was sent by Pope Honorius to preach to the pagans of the interior . Landing from South-ampton Water , he found himself already among pagans , and he began his work at once , protected by the presence of King Oswald , who was on a visit to Cynegils , King of Wessex , intending to marry his daughter . The mission could not fail of success : the king was baptized , and his people with him ; cunt surf gente , the masses of the nation . // One of the converts was his son Cuichelm , the would-be assassin of King Edwin . The city of Dorchester on the Thames , then a residence of the King of Wessex , became the bishop 's see . The sequel was as before : hasty conversion and sudden relapse . The next king , Cenwall , adhered to the old pagan religion , and married a sister of I'cnda . But he repudiated her and fled to East Anglia , where he was converted and baptized . Restored to his kingdom , after some years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The conversion of Mercia was the work of the Northumbrian Irish Church . Penda had raised Mercia to equal rivalry with the great northern kingdom . He made frequent irruptions into Northumbria , more than once as far as Bain-burgh , and burned the king 's home there . Oswy , when he became king , desired peace , and would have purchased it with gifts . Driven to a despair-ing effort , he defeated Penda and thirty sons of kings or petty under-kings with him , most of them of the old Mercian states , in a hard-fought battle by the River Winwd in Lothian . The old pagan fell and the old gods with him . He was eighty years of age , and had reigned thirty years . He had spent his reign in war : the ( ' luistian kings did the same . He saw nothing in the new religion to command submission ; much to make him scorn the men " who professed to he converted to it and did not do its works . " " They were contemptible and wretched who did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , preserved by Bede , suggest that he was not the // mere " sanguinary tyrant , " the " man of brute violence , " that modern writers represent him to have been . Peada , a son of Penda , had demanded Elfleda , a daughter of Oswy , to wife ; and her father made it a condition that he should become a Christian . IIe was persuaded , and returned home accom-panied by Chad , an Englishman , and an Irish convert , the patron saint of Lichfield , and three other priests , who had been allowed by Penda to preach to all who would hear them . ' Peada succeeded his father for a short time , under the supremacy of Oswy ; and , it was said , fell a victim to the treachery of his Christian wife . He was cruelly murdered . 5 . The baptisms of the kings and peoples , what-ever their effect upon themselves or their results in times following , gave great satisfaction at Rome , and were warmly acknowledged by popes ' epistles to the kings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " most glorious lord and son most pre-eminent , " and is charged to promote the faith in the English nation , over which his glory is set at the head , exhorting , terrifying , soothing , correcting , that he may have his reward in heaven , and that the name of his glory may be still more glorious to posterity ; even as the name of Con-stantine , the most pious emperor , surpasses in fame and reputation the names of the princes his predecessors . . . and so , my lord and son , may heavenly grace preserve your excellency in safety . " 2 The same lofty style is adopted to Edwin of // Northumbria . He is " the glorious Edwin , King of the English " ; after his baptism , he becomes " most excellent lord and son most pre-eminent " ; his wife is " the glorious lady , our daughter the queen Athelburga . " The Pope inditing in the Roman style , " Boniface , bishop , servant of the servants of God " is , in Anglo-Saxon eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporal of the city still held in honour as the ancient mistress of the world ; Edwin and the kings after him , with their peoples , are for many centuries , in all Roman eyes , despised barbarians ; Atlielbert , the " most glorious lord , " was the grand-son of the sea-rover /Esc , the son of Hengest . The papal letters thus exalting him among his Jut landers of Kent recall to mind the old policy of pagan Rome ? to dominate mankind through the vanity of kings . The monk of Jarrow is gratified in his Roman prejudices , by the " Pope 's " desire to glorify the king with temporal honours as he had attained to the inheritance of the heavenly glory . " 1 The temporal glory was openly displayed in Bede 's native Northumbria , where the first Chris tian king adopted a pomp and style hitherto unknown among the men of his race , and borrowed from the Eastern Empire . He had banners carried before him and an imperial standard , a spear crowned with a tuft of feathers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English people t allcd it the Tuff . " ' Kings after him in Wessex and elsewhere followed the parade of Edwin . // The predominance of the bishop of Rome over the Church and kings of England becomes an important clement of history during ages following , and the accounts of its rise and progress are found abundantly in Pope 's epistles and in the Acts of synods and councils . With the letters to the kings , we have others addressed by Gregory to Augustine . The first of these , in answer to questions relating to bishops , church-alms , marri age , and forms of worship , has little or no bearing upon any difficulty or danger of Engish life , and little interest historically . But some further in structions sent through Mellitus have a wider significance . Gregory advisesl : That the heathen temples be not demolished , but sprinkled with holy water , to convert them from the service of devils to that of the true God . The people will come most readily to their accus tomed places of worship . The idols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in them . The old heathenism had its holidays and feasts in honour of the gods ; they were to be kept up and dedicated to the saints . The oxen might be killed as before , but not in sacrifice to the idols , and the feasts of flesh were allowed : " the devil 's guilds " were turned into Christian holidays and saints ' days . It might carry us beyond the scope of history to discuss the Christian prudence of these accom modations , or the different views of them taken by historians . The venerable Bede observes " how // studiously Gregory watched for the salvation of our nation " ; the philosophic Hume , that " notwithstanding his ignorance and prejudices , he was not unacquainted with the arts of governing mankind . " b . The acts and canons of several early councils and clerical synods show something more both of the work of the Church and of its guiding influences . A uniform rule for the day of the Easter festival had for some centuries been in request among the prelates of different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oak . The early Jewish Christians adhered to the day of their Passover , which might be on any day of the week . Other Christians adopted the Sunday ; the ancient British and Irish Churches the fourteenth day of the moon , or the Sunday following ; the Roman Church , the Sunday following the fourteenth day . ' Fliis small difference caused unusual inconvenience to Oswy and his household . He had his religion and its customs from Iona ; his wife Enflcde , the daughter of Edwin and Athelburga , had hers from Kent and Rome . It happened sometimes , therefore , that when Oswy and his people were keeping their Easter , she and her attendants were only at Palm Sunday , and had another week 's fasting to do . The venerable historian makes much both of the domestic inconvenience and of the religious import of the question . Extolling the zeal and piety of the Irish Christians , he qualifies his // praises : " many are moved with fear lest , " with all their piety , " they may have run in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with charity and are worthy to come to the perfect knowledge " of the right Sunday for Easter-day . To settle the great question , and along with it another which had arisen concerning " the ton-sure , " or the shaving of the monastic heads , King Oswy summoned a council at the monastery of Streonshall , afterwards Whitby , ' a house founded by himself as a thank-offering for his victory of Winwacd , of which Hilda , of the house of Edwin , was the abbess . It was a double foundation , with a house for monks and one for nuns . It was here that C ( ( edmon , the earliest English poet , wrote his verses on the Creation and other subjects . Hilda found him among the cowherds , and ad-mitted him to the monastery . The Synod of Whitby was attended by Oswy with his son Alfrith , who followed his mother 's customs ; Agilbert , Bishop of the West Saxons , with Wilfrith , then Abbot of Ripon ; and a Deacon , James , who came with Paulinus and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was represented by Colman , the third Bishop of Lindisfarne ; he followed Finan . After long arguments , perplexing to Oswy , he caught at a straw . Wilfrith mentioned the kingdom of heaven as given to St. Peter , with the common assumption that the Pope inherits from Peter . Colman , upon question , could not tht khd bn in tColumb // and the king determined not to go against the doorkeeper , lest there should be none to open . The question of Easter was thus decided for the English people of all time . The other contention also yielded to St. Peter . ' The heads of " the religious " were to be shaven on the crown , leaving a circlet of hair like the crown of thorns . It was called " the tonsure of St. Peter . " ' The Eastern fashion of shaving from the forehead and leaving the hair like a crescent moon was " the tonsure of Simon Magus . " The decision was an important step in the subjection of England to the Bishop of Rome . Colman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , departed to Iona or to Ireland . The submission of Northumbria made that of the rest of the island a question of time . The northern Picts held to their customs for yet fifty years ; Iona for twenty more . The historian celebrates , with fervent simplicity , this last conversion to the true Easter cycles and the coronet of hair ! King Oswy may have been partly influenced by political motives . Overlord of Mercia , he had taken part with Peada in founding the abbey of Peterborough . The Synod was held in the reign of Wulfer , when the Mercians were recovering their independence . Oswy had cause for desiring closer relations with Kent , and acted in concert with its King Egbert in sending Wighard , an Englishman , to Rome to be consecrated Arch72 HISTORY OF ENGLAND . bishop of Canterbury . Wighard died there o the plague , and Pope Vitalian took upon him t appoint in his place a foreigner then at Rome known as Theodore of Tarsus . After a delay of some months , found to b necessary for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Roman fashion , hi head , externally , was duly qualified for consecra tion . In England he became an active organize and administrator . he was received throughout the country as its chief bishop ; divided it int parishes and recast the boundaries of dioceses . Theodore was also a founder of English learn ing . IIe has the credit of bringing in the poem of Homer . His school at Canterbury and it scholars obtained an European reputation . But ecclesiastical regulations are matters o outward order to the Church , as the tonsure i to the head . The apostolic work of him and hi successors is to be sought elsewhere , and for the most part in the acts of their synods , which Theodore began to hold at certain periods . His first Council was held at Hertford , ' and was a conference of himself and five bishops ? namely , " of the East Angles , of the Kentish castle called Rochester , of the West Saxons , and of the Mercians , personally , and Wilfrith o Northumbria by his proxies " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The canons of this Council were ten in number . Of these , the first related to Easter-day ; the eight following related to matters of order among the // bishops , monks , and clergy : they were to be con-tent with their own work and not wander else-where . A yearly synod had to be held at Clovesho . The tenth article , " Of marriages , lawful wedlock , adultery , and divorce , " shows that the morals and conduct of the people fell within the scope of a church synod . Theodore 's second Council of which we have record was held at Hatfield , ' seven years after that of Hertford . It made no pretension to dis-cuss any matter of English interest , but was called for obtaining the assent of the English Church to the decrees of six great Councils concerning the Nature and Will of God , the Divinity of Christ , and other doctrines divinely wise to the mind of the subtle Greek , often difficult of appre-hension to the more obtuse mind of the West ; sacred dogmas in themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century like the refined gold of the Temple to the people perishing of hunger in the straitness of the siege . But it had come to be deemed expedient that all Christians should think alike , or at least speak as if they did . 7 . Yet withal , that higher influences , and more beneficial to human life , were at work among the early converts becomes evident in Christian lives , few among many , of the times following ; and we find traces of them both in Church ordinances and in the early laws . The penalties of the Church were to be feared for certain crimes exempt from the national jurisdiction , as in the // case of a master who slew his servant . ' The Church had influence in setting some limits to the labours of serfs and slaves : it claimed for them the Sunday 's rest , and in the end secured it by laws which gave them their freedom if they were compelled to work . ' Whether it did all it might have done , or why it failed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' social life in their later times ; whether there he truth in the assertions of impartial witnesses that the later Anglo-Saxons exhibit , i worse depravity than their ancestors described by l acitus ; ? these must be questions worthy of attention in any history of the six centuries after their conversions . S. Wilfrith , 3 one of the two earliest leaders of the Roman movement , was of a noble house of Northumbria , and was educated at Lindisfarne and Rome . After the synod of Whitby he be-came Bishop of York , where he roofed the church with lead and filled the windows with glass . He also built the churches of Ripon and Hexham , both of wrought stone , with columns and aisles ? so they are described ; that of Hexham for its size and beauty as surpassing all on this side of the Alps . A quarrel with King Egfrith , who invited Theodore to divide the diocese of York without its bishop 's consent , led to the first appeal ? it was made by Wilfrith ? from England to Rome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // us an early picture of the Church rulers , so profuse in their flatteries of the kings , reserving their most exalted heathenish laudations for themselves . Pope Agatha is " most holy and thrice most blessed bishop . " He reciprocates : the bishops are " your holy brotherhood , " " this venerable convention . " We have " Wilfrith , lovely in the sight of God " ; he responds , " Your pontifical beatitude . " The appeal was decided in favour of Wilfrith , but the king and Witan declined the Roman jurisdiction , and sent him to prison . After some months he was allowed to depart ; but he was compelled to leave Mercia and Wessex also , and went and preached to the South Saxons , who were the last Englishmen to become Christians , and it was under his teaching . He instructed them also in the art of fishing , of which it is strange that they should have been ignorant . He had , before this , been a preacher to the pagans of Friesland , having gone among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than once recalled to and expelled from Northumbria . But the thing of chief importance concerning him is that no man was so deeply responsible as he for the Roman supremacy over the men of his race , and for their religious faith during the following ages . He was one of the first Englishmen who visited Rome , and was a friend and fellow-traveller of Biscop . They divide between them the honour of their buildings and of the arts and learning they brought home with them . Benedict Biscop , the other Roman champion , // and a frequent traveller to Rome , was the founder and abbot of the house of Wearmouth . He employed foreign masons and glass-workers , brought in paintings , gold-work , and embroidery . The art of making glass had been lost in England since the Roman days . English workmen owed much to him , and English women had their first lessons from his tapestries , and became famous in needlework . The Venerable Bede , to whom principally we owe our knowledge of these times , was educated in L'iscop 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house of Jarrow . He taught many pupils whose light of learning shone out from the dark political atmosphere of the North for many years . By his Ecclesiastical History of the English People , to which we have been so much indebted , and by Commentaries on the Scriptures and other works still remaining , he is known as the Father of English History and of English Learning .

The Latin Church and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lords of Britain , bearing so many marks of their German origin , are seen , however , to be much altered in character by their deeds of conquest and their new conditions of life . The change shows itself in their wars of ambition and avarice among themselves , wars of kingdom with kingdom and man with man , never to cease till they were rooted out of the land or trodden down among their serfs . Before they are masters of half the land we have Athelbert of Kent and Kelin of Wessex in conflict for the country of the Lower Thames . Ceolwulf , King of Wessex during // the mission of Augustine in Kent , waged continual war indifferently upon his kindred Saxons or upon Welsh and Picts and Scots . After the wars of Athelfrith with Edwin and Redwald , of Oswald and Oswy with Penda , re-sulting in the fall of Penda , Northumbria towered above the of her kingdoms . Wessex was divided ; Kent was isolated ; Mercia fell into subjection to Oswy and his under-king , a son of Penda , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egfrith , Oswy 's son and successor , carried his arms into that kingdom and into Lindsey , its dependency . Ile attacked the Britons of Strath-clyde , and added Carlisle to the see of Lindis-farne . Then , against the advice of its bishop , Cuthbert , he sent an army into Ireland and " wasted the land of the Scots , a harmless people , always most friendly to the English . " i Egfrith next sought to extend his kingdom beyond the Forth , but was drawn by the Picts into a rugged country and destroyed with his whole army , at a place called Nectansmer.2 The defeat was fatal to Northumbrian great-ness . The next century is lurid with strife and disorder . Of the first five kings , four died in battle ; Oswy had the rare fortune of dying in his bed . Of a dozen or more following ? some of them not of the old kingly house ? only Egfrith died in battle . One or two died in bed ; most of them were assassinated or killed in tumults ; some were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was anarchy : the fields lay waste , the people starved and perished . Cuthbert , the saint of Durham , was a Border man ; a monk , then Prior of Melrose , and next Abbot of Lindisfarne , whence he retired to a hermit 's life in Aidan 's island of Farne . By the influence of King Egfrith , he was drawn , against his will , to be the Bishop of Lindisfarne . His enduring fame had its origin in his labours and travels on horse and foot to preach to the poor people of the Cheviot hills and wilds , and of the lands adjacent . 2 . Upon the collapse of Northumbria , Mercia obtained the supremacy of the kingdoms . King Wulf , while nominally subject to Oswy his over-lord , had turned southward upon Wessex , made himself master of the four towns ? Aylesbury and the others ? and advanced his frontier to the Thames and his influence much farther . The men of Sussex , who were subject to Wessex , invoked his aid and submitted to him . He almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Essex submitted to him and became Christian . His reign of eighteen years was one of continual war ; in his last year he fought a terrible battle at Beadenhead ( Bodwin ) with Ascwin , King of Wessex , where many thousands were slain on both sides , " for the pride and empty glory of the kings . " ' The small kingdoms suffered from both sides in the contentions of the larger . Lindsey , after the raid of Egfrith , was laid waste by Athelred , 8o HISTORY OF ENGLAND . the brother and successor of Wulf , both of them claiming supremacy over it . Athelred also in-vaded Kent , destroyed Rochester and neighbour-ing churches and religious houses , and ravaged the county from side to side . Then after ten years the lordship over Kent and Sussex was reclaimed with lire and sword by Cadwalla of Wessex . For a brief period the smaller people had their revenge . Mul , or Mo11o , a brother of Cadwalla , was entrapped in a house he was plundering , and was burned alive with twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the penalty ; it was ravaged " till nothing was left for capture or destruction , " and years afterwards was ravaged again by King Ina , till the large sum of thirty thousand pounds was paid him for the wergild of Mul . The English kings , after a restless life of war , often-sought rest in a monastery . Athelred , after nearly thirty years , retired to his own foundation of Bardney . Cadwalla gained the kingdom by violence , adhered to the old paganism , and after three years went to end his days at Rome , where he was baptized . 3 . Ina his successor was the greatest of the kings of Wessex before Alfred , both in war and as a prudent ruler and a wise legislator . He raised Wessex above the kingdoms . By a severe defeat of Cedred , the son of Athelred , on the old field of Wanborough , he put a check on the aggressions of the Mercian and freed the city of London from his dominion . In the south-west he advanced his boundary against the Welsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave its origin to the town o Taunton . Cenwall of Wessex , between the year 65o and 66o , after defeating the Welsh at Bradford on the Avon and at Mount Pen in Somerset , had carried his boundary beyond the Axe . Ina ad vanced it , or made it secure to the Tone and I'arret , and within the last gained lands , upon the site of an ancient British monastery , founded his celebrated house and school of Glastonbury , the first seat of English education for a long period After a reign of nearly forty years , he retired to end his days at Rome . The kingdom of Mercia was becoming once more aggressive , and seven years after Ina 's retire-ment its king , Athelbald , marched into Wessex , stormed the king 's tow n of Somerton , and com-pelled his recognition as lord of Wessex , and of England south of the Humber . He had even begun to style himself lord of Britain . But his fortune turned . Within twenty years the West Saxons revolted and defeated their over-lord in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he lost his life . Offa of Mercia , his successor , maintained and extended his authority over the neighbouring kingdoms . He was a man of versatile powers and a great king . He attacked the King of Wessex in his palace at Bensington , and enlarged his kingdom of Mercia with parts of Oxfordshire and Berks . The King of Kent was crushed in a battle at Oxford . East Anglia was gained in a shorter way . Its King Athelbert , " a prince of great merit , " who had come to marry one of his // daughters and was sleeping under one of the roofs of his palace enclosure , was treacherously seized and beheaded . ' Offa advanced the Mercian frontier and strength ened it on the side of Wales . He made himself master of Powis-land , of which the chief town , Pengwern , became Scrubsbury , euphonized into Shrewsbury . Ile constructed the massive line of earthworks , a ditch and rampart , running a hundred miles , from the I ) ee below Chester to the Severn opposite to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a reign of nearly forty years , Ding Offa began to think of atoning for his sins . That this was to be done by a money payment was the assured opinion of the age , and was in accord with the old English custom of the wergild , or money payment in atonement for murder . Offa had the sanctions both of pagan customs and of Christian teachers in making a payment to God for the murder of Athelbert of East Anglia . He bestowed a tenth of his war spoils upon the Church , and expiatory fees upon his city of Here-ford , where the crime was perpetrated . He made further atonement , under the guid ance , it was said , of heavenly visions , by building and endowing the abbey of St. Albans ; and also , according to some later accounts , by a pilgrimage to Rome and by his liberality there . He made a grant to the Pope , perhaps for the support of an English college which he founded , of an annual // tax upon every house of his realm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fruitful tribute for many ages . I t is recorded that he corresponded on friendly terms with Charlemagne , King of the Franks and Emperor of the Romans , who may have regarded the old province of Britain as within his empire Intl predominance , but could hardly recognize an equal in its king . .1 . The court or the camp of Charlemagne afforded for some years an asylum to Egbert of Wessex , descended from a brother of King Ina . Strife for the kingship had not ceased : Bertric , with the help of Offa , his father-in-law , gained the election over Egbert and drove him beyond sea . Bertric 's Mercian wife , Edburga , is one of several instances that the lawless violence of the times was not confined to the sterner sex . Her mother was said to have plunged a dagger into the heart of another son-in-law . She loved power herself , and was as little scrupulous as her father in obtaining it . She had prepared a poisonous draught for an Ealdorman Warr , a friend of her husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perished miserably at last , begging her bread with a slave or companion in the streets of Pavia . Egbert , sometimes called the first King of England , was upon the death of Bertric sum-Honed to assume the crown of Wessex . ' His accession must have weakened the influence of // the Mercian king over Wessex which had been gained by Offa ; but the two kingdoms were at peace for some years , while the Mercian supremacy over Kent , East Anglia , and Essex , obtained by open violence and treacherous murder , was asserted with remorseless tyranny . A successor of Offa had a few years before , in another invasion of Kent , defeated and captured its king , Edbert 1'raen , and led him away iii chains ; one account adds , to have his hands cut off and his eyes put out . The Mercian tyranny was at length abated by the ability and energy of Egbert .

But Exeter became and continued for some time a double town , with its English and Welsh quarters . The Mercian King Bernulf , whether jealous of his success and growing strength , or having intelligence of his relations with East Anglia , led an army into Wessex , and was defeated by Egbert in the murderous battle of Ellandune ( Wilton ) . From the field of battle Egbert despatched an army into Kent , in command of his son Athelwulf and Elstan , a warrior bishop . King Baldred was quickly put to flight and crossed the Thames , and Kent thenceforward was governed by a half-king of the West Saxon house . The East Anglians took the opportunity of revolt , and called in the help of Egbert , who , after the defeat and death // of liernulf in an irruption into their country , succeeded him in the supremacy . The East Saxons also submitted to him , and he led his army into Mercia , which made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the position of a half-king . Egbert was thus lord of England to the Humber . He crossed the river , and was met by the chief Northumbrian nobles at Dore , where they offered tribute and made submission . Egbert was therefore King of Wessex and over-lord of the other English kingdoms . But the lord of England was not to end his days in peaceful greatness . A new terror had arisen in the land . An enemy was making descents upon the coasts which recall to us those of the Angles and Saxons four centuries before . The new assailants were the Northmen , known in French history as the Normans , in English as the Danes ? men of kindred race and language with the English themselves . 5 . When we compare the Anglo-Saxons of the sixth century with the Danes of the ninth , it becomes evident that the Danes are very much what the English had been , and that the English are no longer the men they were . The causes of the decline are not difficult to trace . The continual wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were obstacles to combination , but they exercised the military skill and courage of the warriors . Other agencies must have been at work . The deeper causes of their decline lay in the wars of the English classes among themselves , and especially in the depreda86 HISTORY OF ENGLAND . tions of the strong upon the weaker freemen , both in their lands and in their personal freedom . At the end of the sixth century , we have learned , the English freemen were of two classes ? the cods and the ceorls , separated from one another by no wide interval . Under their system of settled fines for personal offences , the relative estimation of the classes is shown with the exact ness of money values . For an offence of gross injury and insult the seduction of their brides  - -  the damages to the coil are no higher than the double of those to the ccorl . ' The social import ance of the ccorl is shown in many of the early laws , but they also show that it grew less from age to age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlements , the bulk of the new-corners were , of necessity , the ceorls . They over-spread the country with a minority of eorls among them , like the old tribesmen and the honorary nobles . After their six centuries of possession , a great change had passed over their social system . The Domesday record of the Norman conqueror affords a series of pictures of the condition of the people immediately before and after his conquest . Throughout the country , except in the more recently settled Danish districts , no class re mained at all corresponding to the original free ceorls , and only a comparatively few scattered families in possession of moderate estates which could have been inherited from free ceorls . Enor mous possessions were in the hands of the king // and of a very few great lords or earls , having under them a considerable class of lordlings called " thegns " or " thanes , " their dependents and ser vitors , having estates of their own . A remarkable document ' of the later Anglo-Saxon period bears the same evidence . It recites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king and the great earls . First among them are the thanes ; below these the several classes of serfs down to slaves . Freeholders of land deriving from the once principal class of the ceorls are too few in number to be worth mentioning among the divers classes of the people . Earlier records show the course of things in progress . In the days of King Alfred there are still free ceorls in Wessex who are of some account . ' And yet , upon lands of his own , many who retain the name are sunk into serfdom . The ceorls on his estate of Hurstbourne held their " virgates " or yard-lands ? commonly about thirty of the scattered acre-strips to each  --  not only at a rent , but also under obligations to work for their lord a certain number of days in the week , and in many cases over and above their fixed service " to do as they are bid . " The acreage and the terms of their holdings are those of the upper class of serfs . The very name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ceoris retaining their old freedom still exist , but apparently few in number . // 6 . Two centuries before Alfred , we meet with the same change widely in progress , and we come directly upon its causes . It is enacted by a law of Ina ' " If a man agree for a yard of land or more at a fixed rent and plough it , if the lord desire to raise the land to him to service and to rent , he need not take it upon him if the lord do not give him a dwelling ; and let him not lose the acres . " Of the class of ceorls still in existence some are becoming landless and some houseless , and the debasement is of enough importance to call for a special law to restrict it . The ceorl become landless seeks to hold of a landlord at a rent , which would be paid in kind . The lord after agreement with him is disposed to raise ( the rent of ) the land to service ? that is , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was enlarged with the extent of his lands and the numbers of his men upon them . The law enacts that the impoverished ceorl shall not be compelled to service unless the lord find him a house : he retains his freedom as long as he has a house of his own . Another law takes special care of the freeman 's house . If he died leaving a child , the house was put under the care of the kindred till the child was of age . ' It was a further protection to the ceorl that he might refuse to be bound to service without risk of losing his acre-strips under cultivation ( Aicra ) . The lords , we see , in their greed of domains and the men upon them , would have recourse to disSEVENTH // honest coercion , by putting their free tenants under the alternative of descending into bondage or quitting the land and losing their crops . The continual impoverishment of the small landowners carried with it the aggrandizement of the great lords . Bing Alfred by his will deals with more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number , we may assume , than a captain of the keelmen would have been allowed to appropriate as his share of the spoils . He had also a number of estates of his own acquisition besides those he inherited . ' The kings before Alfred , we must infer , had been gathering lands and lordships into their hands as he did himself , and as the kings after hirn certainly did . The possessions of Edward , the last of the house of Cerdic , some hundreds in number , far exceeded those of Alfred . Those of Earl Godwine and his sons , and of the great Earls of Mercia and Northumbria were enormous . A thane who died in the year 1002 was the owner of eighty different estates . Thus the wars of the kingdoms , the frequent and bloody battles , the files of English prisoners driven by Englishmen to some seaport to be sold abroad , were less destructive to the common free-men than the grasping ambition of their own more powerful neighbours . Nor have we come to the worst . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records tell us , for a lordly landowner , if he did not find the humbler freemen otherwise at his // mercy , to have recourse to violence . With his armed men he would invade a freeman 's house , sometimes in the night , murder the owner and his family , and take possession of the estate , claiming it as his own or alleging the right of private war . 7 . Exposed to such dangers , and to the ravages of yTar , the small proprietor was compelled to put himself under the protection of some powerful neighbour . Great lords were ambitious to be protectors , but upon conditions . The weaker neighbour must surrender himself and his lands and become " the man " of the over-lord , holding them no longer as freehold , but upon stipulated terms . It has been called the system of personal allegiance ; in fact , it was personal servitude . The following is a common form of oath taken by a freeman who " commended " himself to a lord : The Oath of Commendation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love all whom he loves , and to shun all whom he shuns , conformably to the laws of God and man ; and never , willingly nor wittingly , by word or deed , do aught that is hateful to him , on condition that he keep me as I am willing to earn , and all that fulfil which was agreed upon when I submitted to him and chose his will . " The omission of written record of the terms of agreement could not fail to be further detrimental to the weaker party , and the whole deed is one enduring evidence of what these ages were . SEVENTH AND EIGHTH CENTURIES . 9T 8 . And yet these ages of violence had their regular assemblies for the administration of justice and government by law . There were meetings of the village or township , which would settle the intakes and allotments , and probably mediated in matters of contention ; but the civil and criminal jurisdictions were with the Moots of the Hundred and of the Shire . In the later Anglo-Saxon centuries that of the Hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year . The Shire-moot was summoned by the sheriff , who sat with the ealdorman and the bishop ; the other members were the nobles and principal official persons of the county . The Hundred-moot , summoned by the " hundred-man , " an elected officer , was con-stituted of the lords of lands or their representa-tives , with the priest and four " best men " from every parish or township . There were also moots of boroughs , which met thrice a year . Attend-ance was compulsory under heavy penalties for persistent neglect of summons . ' But great lords could set their jurisdiction at defiance if any one ventured to implead them . Above these courts the supreme jurisdiction was with the king 's court of the " Witan , " or the " Witena-gemot . " The King and Witan appointed the ealdormen of counties , who were the magis-trates and military commanders . They made war or peace . King Alfred obtained the consent of his Witan to some of the provisions of his will . They elected the king , and could depose him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it ; occasionally , as in the case of Sigebert , they enforced their power to expel the king . The expulsion of Sigebert and its consequences afford a remarkable picture of the age . The Chronicle relates that Sigebert , " for his unright deeds , " was driven from his kingdom , except Hampshire , by his kinsman Cynewulf and the West Saxon Wit an . A prolonged family feud ensued . An " atheling " or royal prince , Sigebert 's broth r , almost thirty years afterwards , was in danger of expulsion by Cynewulf , when he found an opportunity of attacking a house at Merton where the king was lodging , having a small com-pany of attendants in the town . The king rushed out upon the prince and wounded him , but was himself cut down by the armed men . Cynewulf 's thanes in the town gathered to the rescue , and finding him dead refused terms and fought till all but one wounded man , a Welshman , were slain . The next morning another company of king 's men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , refused all promises of the atheling , and slew him and all his men , eighty-four in number , except the atheling 's little son , who was grievously wounded . ' 9 . The accumulation of estates in few hands by the means already indicated was carried further in the appropriation of public lands and offices by the king and Witan to themselves . The Titan , holding along with the king the nominations to offices of dignity and profit , became themselves // the ealdormen , the sheriffs , the bishops ; by due regard for their interests , the king obtained his own . The bishops ' sees became the rewards of compliant clerks ; sometimes the king would vacate a see and fill it with a more obsequious servant , or even sell it . Wulfer the Mercian sold the see of London to Bishop Wini , and we may infer that such a transaction was more frequent than the records of it . But the great source of plunder was the public lands entrusted to the Witan . They were a pre-vious national inheritance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent free to deserving soldiers and servants of the state . The " folk-land " began very early to be converted into " boc-land , " or book-land ? land assigned by book or deed to a private holder or owner . Athelbald , King of the West Saxons , " God helping , with the consent and licence of his bishops and nobles , books twenty hides of public land to himself and to whomsoever he may give it and for ever . " ' The Witan with the king 's consent did the same for themselves and for the king 's thanes of his recom-mendation . Bribes were given to carry trans-actions of the kind , but the chief responsibility was with the king . The signatures to the charters or deeds for them are generally those of the king and his wife and sons ; some of the bishops , abbots , ealdormen , sometimes two or three Welsh chiefs , and with them others , generally outnumbering all the rest and signing as king 's ministers or thanes. // It was a natural consequence that the nobles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king 's compliant servants , till the Witena-gemot was little more than the registrar of his will . Its con-sent to these transactions was dispensed with . The king dealt with the public lands as his own , and appropriated them or gave them away as he thought lit . The king defrauded the nation " by his usurpations of the folkland . " ' These malversations were notorious as early as the time of Bede , who in a famous letter to Lgbert Archbishop of York ' complains that so many persons have obtained estates on pretences of founding monasteries that no place is left where old soldiers and public servants can be settled . He asserts that every prefect or ealdor man for nearly a hundred years has thus provided for himself and for his wife , by gaining the signa tures of bishops , abbots , and secular authorities to his land-books ; and even that grants have been obtained by money paid to the kings . The writer complains particularly of the grants of public lands to what have been called the spuri ous monasteries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands under false pretences of founding religious houses . They built houses and called themselves the abbots . A few monks as a cloak were drawn , by what means possible , from true monasteries ; or they took in some monks who were outcasts for mis conduct ; or in defect of these , they shaved the // heads of some of their servants and called them their monks . These houses , of course , became haunts of vice . They aroused in England the first cry for churchreform , and none desired it more than the monks themselves . 1o . Other transactions of some of the kings and great lords with the monasteries were infamous . Winfrith , called Boniface , an Englishman , a missionary to heathen Germans who , under the patronage of Pepin , the father of Charlemagne , became Archbishop of Mentz , wrote a celebrated letter to Athelbald of Mercial reproaching him for his contempt of lawful matrimony and his " wallowing in luxury and adultery with nuns . " This king , a founder of religious houses , had a harem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The writer mentions two other kings as notorious for the same depravity , which was sometimes perpetrated with violence . Osred of Northumbria went from one religious house to another in quest of his prey . Boniface asserted that almost all the nobles of Mercia followed their king 's evil example . He addressed his complaints to the Archbishop of Canterbury as well as to King Athelbald , and represented the depravity of the Mercian nobles as worse than that of the old Saxons who were heathens . The writer , Winfrith , was , in the end , murdered by a band of heathens at Utrecht , whither he had gone to baptize. rr . These letters arc instances of individual // protest . They obtained little support from any public action of the Church . The conversions of the kings and peoples , the thousands of hasty baptisms , powerless , we have seen , in the wars of the kingdoms , did no more to heal the predatory strifes between man and man . It was the loss of a great opportunity , never to recur , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a people more open to guidance by teachers whom they could look up to , never one more in need of it , than were they in their new homes . The religion which Augustine preached was peculiarly adapted to revive and invigorate all that was good in their old social customs ; enforced by Romans , with their genius of order and organization , it must have had powerful influence over the English settlers . Their powers were immense where they chose to exert them . They enforced laws of marriage under restrictions borrowed from the Mosaic law , made narrower and more severe . Laws to hinder the disinheritance and the decay of families , and the extinction or enslavement of an important class of the people , must have lain equally within their supremacy , and such laws , socially as important as any laws of marriage , possess at least equal authority both of the ancient code and of Christian morals . But they were building up a worldly kingdom themselves , and gathering estates of the Church for its endowments . They could not inculcate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was easier and more profitable to foster the delusion // that the great appropriators made atonement for their sins by sharing their gains with the Church ? a more nefarious heresy than any false doctrine or belief . Multitudes of charters still in existence were the title-deeds of lands bestowed upon re ligious communities ; gifts , not always of pious charity , for they sometimes bear their own wit ness to less worthy motives . ' The Italian rulers had risen to temporal power when the old empire of force was falling . A new empire , more debasing , was to be founded by the enslavement of free mind . The re-making of Europe fell to the Bishop of Rome and his court more than to conquerors or kings , and they above all others were responsible for making it what it is . It would have been a different Europe now , another destiny than befel them would have been that of the handsome Anglo-Saxon race , if the rulers of the Church had inherited the spirit of the teachers whose authority they claimed . Kings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fierce fanaticism were at their service ; men of genius and men of God were in their com mand all over the world . All these powers they employed , more as rulers than as teachers , not to amend and guide the men of the seven kingdoms , whom they despised as barbarians , but to re-establish the despotic empire with themselves for its over-lords and tax-masters . They converted the Teutonic peoples from heathenism and left them worse men than they found them ; with their lands and villas of lords and slaves farther distant // from a Christian community than the communities , already degenerate , of the centuries long before . The pictures of the people by William of Malmeshury in the eleventh century exhibit a far worse depravity than those of Tacitus in the first ; and wiser men of their own race , as Winfrith , upbraided them with their degeneracy beneath their forefathers . 12 . The worst and fatal consequence of their transactions with the lands , public and private , was the decay of the old race of freemen , ending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could have little spirit for national defence . Many would be too poor to obtain the needful armour , or would be destitute of military training ; and many , sunk into the condition of serfdom , would be disqualified to serve in arms . ' Of the military resources of the country against the first irruptions of the Danes our information is defective , but it is plain in the events that the backbone of the nation was broken , and that a new organization by King Alfred saved it from utter ruin . Certain it is that the king with the great lords and their thanes , overladen with the spoils of the country , had to pay the penalty , first to invading hordes of Northmen , then to the more desolating ravager , the Franco-Norman , who brought upon them a fate more ruinous than their forefathers inflicted upon the more ancient Britons . There is a unity in the story of early England , and it deserves attention . CHAPTER VI . ALFRED AND THE DANES . 1 . Terrible havoc ; defence by Egbert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the religious houses-2 .

His works of peace : education , law , and others-6 . Powerless against prevailing social dangers . I. IN the year 787 , when Bertric King of Wessex was at his home at Dorchester , a company of men from three strange ships landed on the coast near , killed a high reeve who was sent to bring them before the king , and sailed away laden with booty . A few years later a band of men landed upon the coasts of Northumberland , not without resistance , and burned the church of Lindisfarne and the monastery of Tynemouth . Both of those bands were Northmen in quest of plunder , to be known too well as Danes . It is not till the latter years of Egbert that their assaults are heard of as frequent and forrnidable . They reappeared in the Isle of Sheppey and in Dorset , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding allies in the Welsh of Cornwall , they fought with Egbert and defeated him 99 I00 HISTORY OF ENGLAND . 835 at Charmouth , but were defeated by him at Hengston Hill . It was his last battle . The twenty years ' reign of his son Athelwulf , or Athulf , were years of frightful suffering and terror . The Pagans , as the English called them , now with 35 ships , were met in hard-fought battles by sea and land , from Devonshire to Kent , and carried fire and sword from Kent to the Humber . With a fleet increased to 350 ships the Danes entered the Thames and stormed London and Canterbury ; and although defeated by Athelwulf 851 with much slaughter at Ockley in Surrey , and in a sea-fight off Sandwich by Athelstan his son and under-king of Kent , yet they had wintered in Thanet and were soon after wintering in Sheppey . Cruelty and slaughter and the terror of the Danes overspread the land ; churches and lordly dwellings were burned down , neither woman nor child found pity . London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was rebuilt by Alfred . To English thanes and their families the Danes were what the English had been to the Britons ? " heathens , barbarians , a pirate crew , a filthy crew , that pestilential army , foul bands . " They are thus characterized by the chronicler Athelwerd , l a descendant of Athelwulf . Elstan , the warrior-bishop of Sherborne , took a leading part against them ; Swithun of Winchester , another counsellor of Athulf , was a man of peace . The country was thus distressed when Athelwulf , after a gift by charter to the Church of oneEnglish Chronicle , Athelwerd , an . 885 , etc . ALFRED AND THE DANES . IOI tenth of all the lands he possessed , ' set out for home , whither he had already sent his youngest son Alfred , a child in his sixth year . He remained there twelve months , and excited surprise by his costly benefactions . On his return , he found his son Athelbald in revolt , with Elstan supporting him , and consented to a division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving three sons older than Alfred . All the four reigned ? the three elder for but fourteen years among them . Under the eldest , Athelbald , the Danes ravaged Hants and Kent , stormed Winchester , and on their way to their ships , laden with spoil , were met and defeated by the ealdormen of Hants and Berks . But their roving assaults were ending in permanent occupation . Another band of them wintered in East Anglia , horsed themselves and rode to York , where two rival kings made peace together and attacked them within the city walls ; but both were killed , with many of their Thanes and people . ' They again vented their fury upon the churches and cloisters . Tynemouth , Melrose , Streonshalh , and every religious house from the Humber to the Tweed were destroyed . The light of learning , still shining through the intestine strifes , was obscured for ages to follow . They entrenched themselves at Nottingham and IO2 HISTORY OF ENGLAND . scourged Mercia . The King Athelred , and Alfred with him , failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoner its King Edmund , tied him to a tree , and made him the butt for their arrows , shouting to him to abjure his religion .

Once more they turned their fury upon the religious houses . Monks from the Fen houses had fought in Lindsey , and the great monasteries of Croyland , Peterborough , Huntingdon , and Ely were given to the flames . Few of the inmates escaped ; the spoils of gold and silver were carried off ; the buildings of Peterborough were on fire for fifteen days . 2 . All England , except Wessex , was under the feet of the Danes . Guthorm took for himself the kingdom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ; the conquest of Wessex would have made the whole country their own . With that view , their bands from several landing-places converged upon the strong town of Reading . At Englefield Green they were driven back to their lines by the ealdorman of Berkshire , but at Reading they had the advantage over Athelred and his brother Alfred , // who retired by the old Ridgeway and took position upon a high part of the Ashdune ridge between heading and Ashbury , slowly pursued . The battle of Ashdune ' was begun early in the morning by an attack of Alfred , seconded by the King , upon their pursuers , who were occupying some higher ground , and after the day 's hard fighting ended in their defeat and flight , leaving thousands of dead . They were pursued and cut down as long as the daylight lasted . The victory saved Wessex and saved England . The invaders were reinforced and fought two more battles , at Basing and at Merton , with some advantage ; but they barely maintained their ground , and their main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following , according to the old reckoning , succeeded his brother Athelred , who died of his wounds . His succes-sion had been settled by his father , with the consent of the Titan . But he was designated by events . An elder brother had left children , but the nation in that crisis of life and death had need of the true king . The Danes persisted for some years in their design upon Wessex . Within a month , Alfred encountered them near Wilton . It was his ninth battle , besides skirmishes , within twelve months , and it again lasted the whole day . The Danes held their ground , but lost so heavily that they made terms for a retreat out of Wessex . // In the Central and Northern provinces they were masters . By the capture of Kepton , the capital of Mercia , and the capture of King Puhred , that kingdom was extinguished . But they held to their agreement with Alfred till his seventh year , when they resumed their attempts upon Wessex . Guthorm suddenly left his lines near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorset . The King followed them and they renewed their oaths and gave hostages ; then breaking faith , they hastened by horse and ship and seized Exeter . The King hanged the hostages , and marched after them and besieged the city . IIe equipped a fleet and straitened them by blockade , till , hearing that a fleet of one hundred and twenty ships which they were expecting had been wrecked , they once more obtained terms . Guthorm then marched as far as Gloucester , and with his men from Exeter , who arrived by com panies , and large reinforcements by the Severn , he turned against a more vital point ? he attacked and took the King 's castle of Chippenham . It was midwinter , and he had carefully mustered his army while the forces of Alfred were disbanded . Taken by surprise , the King escaped with a small company " to the woods and to the moors . " The people of Wessex were paralyzed , and , in the words of the Chronicle , " many fled beyond sea and most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been over-reached , but he made speedy atonement . He wandered for a few weeks in Selwood Forest , lodged in the hut of a cowALFRED // herd , and about Easter , with a small company , occupied a piece of ground , hardly two acres , within the marshes which lay about the confluence of the Parret and Tone in Somerset . They built a fort upon it and called it Athelney , the " isle of nobles . " In answer to his calls from Athelney , the men of the near shires ? Somerset , Wilts , and Hants ? about Whitsuntide mustered at Egbert 's Stone ( Brixton-Deverill ) , then under the eastern edge of Selwood . They shouted with joy when they saw their king . The next day he led them to Iglea , and early the next morning to Ethandune . The two places are most likely Leigh in the parish of Westbury and Edington , and the events following afford the probable account of the Great White Horse , cut down to the chalk upon the cliff of Bratton Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have marched up the valley under the high and rugged western escarpment of Salisbury Plain , an ancient sea-coast and one of the grandest in the island . The Danes were now entrenched on Batton Hill , where on the morning of the 13th of May they were surprised by the sight of the English army , and still more to learn that it was commanded by Alfred . They came out of their lines , and after a hard-fought battle were repulsed and fled back and held the entrenchments under a siege of fourteen days . 3 . At last , worn out by hunger , they accepted the moderate terms allowed them . They were to quit Wessex and to settle peaceably in the northern and eastern counties already in their Io6 HISTORY OF ENGLAND . possession . The boundary was to be by the Thames from the sea , by the River Lea to its source , thence right to Bedford , and upon the Ouse to Watling Street and by this to near Shrewsbury . It was agreed that Englishmen and Danes should be of equal life-value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratified by the King and Witan at his villa of Wedmore in Somerset . It was also stipulated that Guthorm should profess himself a Christian , and he , with thirty chosen men of his army , was baptized , having Alfred for his godfather . ' Ilasting and the wilder spirits sought fresh fields of adventure beyond sea . Thus Alfred , by the victories of Ashdune , which he shared with Athelred , and those of Ethandune , all his own , twice delivered one half of England from Danish dominion . In the other half the old inhabitants who remained were a subject people , in spite of the treaty . The Danish districts to be known as the Danelagh or Danelaw included South Northumbria , East Anglia , Essex , and the part of Mercia afterwards called the Five Towns , which were Stamford , Leicester , Lincoln , Notting-ham , and Northweorthig , which became Deoraby or Derby . The name " Danelagh " signifies their right to govern themselves " with as good laws as they best might choose . " The rest of Mercia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alfred , by his faithful deputies , the Ealdorman Athelred his son-in-law , jointly // with Athelflede his daughter , long known as " the Lady of Mercia . " Kent became finally a province of Wessex , and was governed by an under-king , generally of the king 's family . Somerset and Wilts retained for some time their hereditary ealdormen , descendants of old kings , now nobles of Wessex . Multitudes of the English inhabitants in the Danish districts had perished by violence and starvation . Of the survivors , many were ousted from their estates , which took Danish names , ending in by instead of ham or tun . The later names continue to this day in great numbers . In Lincolnshire we have Grimsby , Spilsby , Wragby ; but also Boston , Donnington , Grantham , Waddingham . The two classes of names are intermingled in villages of close proximity . But to whatever extent the old proprietors were dispossessed , the Danes here and in the rest of the Danelaw became the dominant race . It was not without difficulty that Guthorm settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the peace of Wedmore lasted for fifteen years , with a year 's interval near the middle of the time . 4 . During the quiet years ensuing , Alfred took active measures , both for the military defence of his kingdom and for the welfare and improvement of its people . He was the first king of England to give a general organization to the national forces . Before his time , all the freemen were bound to obey the king 's summons to the fyrd , or national muster in arms , the small land-owners in // person , the larger with a company of which the number was fixed generally by the custom or charter of an estate , not by its extent . None but freemen were called out : the laws of Ina ' have the two classes , under the names of the gesiths and ceorls , of whom the gesiths or companions were under service to the lord , like the old comites and the later thanes . The continual degradation of the great class of the ceorls to the condition of serfdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fyrd . Whatever the military re-sponsibility of the lords in respect of their new acquisitions of lands ? and upon this point the information is defective ? the population qualified to bear arms must have been greatly reduced in numbers . But the accounts of Alfred 's later years , with the new and well maintained superiority of the defence , suggest that the military forces became more numerous , as well as ? what is out of doubt ? better trained and organized ; and it appears probable that the lords , continually ex-panding in land surface , were from this time bound to serve with contingents proportionate to their estates , and drawn , of necessity , from classes hitherto disqualified to bear arms . During the same interval of peace , all who were liable to service were put under regular training : the militia of every county was divided into two companies to serve alternately , three months in arms , three upon the lands . ' It was another valuable measure that the strong places were permanently garrisoned , towns by the townspeople , assisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The naval forces at the same time engaged the king 's attention , and he was the constructor of the first English navy . The old warriors of the keels and their children after them had long been landsmen , and had lost their old naval skill and daring . Alfred both equipped fleets and had them specially constructed for their work . During his campaign at Wareham and Exeter in 876-7 he employed his first fleet , not a large one , to shut up Exeter from supplies by sea . In his last Danish war , to follow , he contrived vessels of fifty oars or more , twice the length of those he had to meet , swifter and also steadier . His new dispositions soon told , and with power-ful effect . Hasting , after seven years of havoc in France , made another attempt to gain a footing in England . About one-half of his " great army , " as it was called , landed in Kent and laid siege to Rochester , which was held by the citizens till the king brought up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving their horses behind them . The peace of Wedmore was observed for seven or eight years longer ; then Hasting , driven out of France by famine and pestilence , made a final attempt of desperation to conquer Wessex . His " great army " with their horses crossed from Boulogne in two-hundred-and-fifty ships , sailed up the Rother and entrenched themselves at Appledore , not far from the east end of the And-redswood . Soon after , Hasting himself entered the Swale with eighty vessels , seized Milton , a // IIO HISTORY OF ENGLAND . royal vill , and threw up his lines within it . His plans , evidently , had been carefully laid ; but they were defeated by the trained forces and the strategy of Alfred , who took station in a strong position near the wood , from which he could watch both the hostile camps and harass their foraging parties ; while at the same time his son Edward , as great in war as himself , had a force in hand to the south of Appledore ready to act in concert . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The great army never stirred out of Appledore till it was intended to make a movement elsewhere . It made its way through the wood into Hants and Surrey , and was met at Farnham by the combined forces and routed and driven to the Thames ; where it got possession of the Isle of Thorney , at the confluence of the Thames and Colne ; the villages of Colnbrooke and Thorney show the locality . ( See Note H , Appendix . ) During the same time , Hasting effected his escape from Milton by an artifice . He offered his two sons for baptism , with a promise to withdraw from Alfred 's dominions . His terms were accepted ; Alfred and Athelred of Mercia were his sponsors ; and Hasting withdrew from Kent ; but he crossed into Essex and pitched his camp with the usual entrenchments at Benfleet . The king was preparing to attack , when he heard that the Danes of East Anglia were in close alliance with the invader ; and that they had despatched a great fleet to the coast of Devon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; thus again striking at the heart of his kingdom . He marched with his main army to the south-west , leaving Edward and Athelred to watch Thorney and Benfleet . The Danes speedily vacated Thorney and effected a junction with the army from Milton within their lines at Benfleet . Athelred , advancing in pursuit , heard that Hasting had carried his arms into Mercia . The garrison left behind came out against him , but were put to flight . The English pursued them , stormed their lines , and took all within ; and among the women and children they captured the wife of Hasting and his two sons lately baptized . The Danes ' ships were taken and burned or sent to London with the spoils and prisoners . It was a brilliant success , and the first gained by the English upon a Danish entrenchment . Alfred immediately sent to Hasting his wife and his two sons , and the Dane responded by a fresh camp and entrenchments at Shoebury ; whence , reinforced , he marched up the Thames valley and on to the Severn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the near counties , thence up the Severn to Buttington near Welshpool , where he was blockaded within his lines till all the horses were eaten . Then sallying out , the survivors , after great slaughter , made their way back to Essex . Here they were again reinforced , and traversed the country once more , as far as the city of Chester , and from their lines there into North Wales , plundering as they went , and back by Yorkshire to East Anglia . Their women and children were found safe in the island II2 HISTORY OF ENGLAND . of Mersea between the ( Essex ) Colne and the Blackwater . Meanwhile , the Danish fleet returning from the coast of Devon landed and assaulted Chichester , but were driven back to their ships by the towns-people and a few soldiers . The movements of the Dane continued . Putting all his people on hoard ship , he sailed from Thorney and up the Thames and the Lea , and threw up his lilies not far from I led ford and wintered . In the spring a. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the loss of four king 's thanes . At harvest-time King Alfred took his station near the Dane 's position to protect the reapers , and upon observing the situation saw that it was possible to drain off the river and leave the enemy 's fleet aground . ' He built two forts to protect his workmen , who cut two new channels and divided the Lea into three streams . With their fleet locked in , the Danes soon aban doned their camp , and once more leaving their women and children in safe keeping , they tra versed Mercia again as far as the Severn . The Londoners had their revenge : they broke up the stranded vessels upon the Lea , or dragged them down to London . The King pursued the flying foes and found them within lines at Quat ford near Bridgnorth , where they wintered once more . They had quartered themselves upon the soil of England for three years , but had failed of their main purpose . At Quatford their force broke up and dispersed , some to their homes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Seine , where at last they were content to settle in a district offered them by the King of France . The chronicler expresses the English feeling at the deliverance of the country : ? " Thanks be to God , this time they did not utterly crush the English people , who suffered far more those three years from pestilence of cattle and of men . " 5 . The military operations . of Alfred , and his preparations for them , place him high among warriors , and his conduct in all was that of righteous defence . He stands yet higher in works of peace and civilization . He both devised and carried into effect the measures needful in war for his people 's safety ; in peace , for their civiliza-tion . The light of learning kindled by Theodore was already waning in the age of Bede . It had never shone out far from the monastic houses . The Danes all but extinguished its last rays . Few of the nobles could read , fewer could write their names . Alfred relates that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his kingdom to teach him Latin , nor one priest south of the Thames , very few to the north of it , who understood his Latin service books . The ignorant people were lapsing into paganism and Woden-worship , or perhaps had never risen above them.l Alfred has left us the record of his wish that all his free-born subjects should be able to read // the English Scriptures and the clergy the Latin tongue . He sought teachers abroad . The best known arc Asser , a Welshman , a monk of St. David 's whom he prevailed on to live with him six months in the year ; and Grimbald , a priest from Rheims , whom the archbishop at Alfred 's request pleasantly dispatched as a good spiritual wolf-hound , " in exchange for some carnal wolf-hounds , much wanted in his country . " ' Assisted by those teachers , Alfred founded a school in his court for his own children and those of his household and of some of his nobles , and frequently visited it and took part in the work . Ile established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under his eye , some of them compiled or written by himself , generally with variations and additions . He was himself the English writer of his age . Among other works , with the help of Grimbald he translated Bede 's Church History into English , and the Consolations of Philosophy by Boethius , a work than which none perhaps , except the Bible , has been held in higher repute or for so long a time . The Saxon Chronicle , the principal source of the early annals , bears evidence in the sudden fulness of its narratives to the advancement of literary pur suits . Some students infer that it was commenced about this period . ' Alfred has also the fame of a law-giver . His Code begins with the Ten Commandments and several of the Mosaic laws and continues with // laws founded upon older English codes , with alterations suitable to the time . They are de-clared to be adopted with the consent " of all my Witan . " The administration of justice engaged Alfred 's constant attention . He heard causes and reviewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice to poor suitors . Incompetent judges were obliged to obtain instruction , or to resign their offices . Corrupt and dishonest judges were severely punished . Alfred has been given the credit of dividing the country into shires and hundreds , ' but these divisions were much older ? the Anglo-Saxon hundreds older than their settlements in England ; of the shires , some occur in the Chronicle in times before him2 ? the shires and shire-men two cen-turies before him in the laws of Ina.3 It is not unlikely that he may have remodelled some of the ancient " shires " ? increased their number or defined the boundaries more nearly to the modern divisions . King Alfred was a great builder . Besides re-storing the city of London , his friend Asser informs us that he restored and built other cities and towns , besides halls and chambers and royal villas . Among his foundations was a monastery with its school on the site of his fort at Athelney , and a bridge to it with a tower at each end ; a I16 HISTORY OF ENGLAND . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his second daughter , was the first abbess ; and the new minster at Winchester , which gave way to Hyde Abbey . For these works architects and skilled workmen were imported in great numbers . The goldsmith 's and other decorative arts made much progress . Among the useful inventions ascribed to him ? they were in fact revivals ? are the plan of measuring time by means of wax-candles made to buns four hours each , and of the horn lantern rnjutred in rudely built hams . king Alfred has a place , as one of many , among able warriors and peaceful rulers . He stands apart in the twilight of the past in the purity of his purposes and integrity of his conduct . As warrior , he saved his country on the verge of ruin with a skill and success which would have tempted most men from defence to conquest . He had every provocation to aggressive war , but he had a work to do which he preferred . A war of conquest could at the best only have aggrandized himself and have left his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their debasement. 6 . Having chosen , then , the sphere of a peaceful ruler , Alfred could not be blind to the social ills and dangers of his kingdom . He knew as well as we can the condition of his forefathers during centuries before they came to England , he knew much better than we do what they were when they came and what they were as he saw them , and what causes had been at work to change // them from what they had been to what they were . We shall justly infer from all we know of him that he had in himself the powers requisite for the amelioration of the social system , or even , if such a thing were possible , for laying it on better foundations . But his people were incapable of it . The lands of the nation , private and public , had long been falling under the lordship of a small minority of them , and the kings before him had been the chief offenders . To turn the current by hasty interference was an impossibility . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he did what he could with all his ability . He bent him-self to the education and improvement of the people ; and his dealings with his own lands show that he knew what was wanted , and sought to make it known to others . When he became king he found himself a great landowner , the lord of many " hams " and " tuns " and their estates . By his will he bequeathed one-fourth of them to each of his sons , and the other half in smaller portions to his wife , his three daughters , and other relatives . He also be queathed their personal freedom , or the liberty " to go where they would " and to choose their own lords ' to all the men on the estates which he had purchased himself . Even to do this he re quired the sanction of his Witan . " The West Saxon Witan , " he affirms , " have acknowledged my right to leave such persons either bond or free as I will " and he prays in God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heirs or kinsmen oppress them , or exact money from them for what he has given . In the nation the current of things was unchanged . If for a time there was any energy of new life , there was no lasting improvement . The lords of lands still grew richer and greater and fewer ; the poorer freemen went on decaying and dwindling and sinking into serfdom . That Alfred 's religion was that of a sincere Christian no one will question . Some will find the proof of it in his whole life , others in his devoted submission to the Roman Church , his acceptance of its foolish and impossible miracles such as fragments of the true Cross , and his yearly exports of money from himself and his people to the Pope . The superstition was that of his age , and did not invalidate his true profession . " As long as I have lived I have striven to live worthily , and to leave the remembrance of me in good works to those who shall come after . " It remains to be told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an internal malady , apparently not understood , which kept him in a condition either of painful suffering or the dread of it . His wife , Athelswithe , was the daughter of a Mercian noble ? Athelred , Earl of the Gaini , who left their name to Gainsborough . He left two sons , Edward , his successor , and Athelwerd , who died in early manhood ; and three daughters ? Athelflede the lady of Mercia , Athelgive the // abbess , and Alfredal the wife of Baldwin Count of Flanders and ancestress of Matilda the wife of William the Norman . CHAPTER VII .

Inferior , it was said , to Alfred in learning , he was thought to equal or surpass him in the might and dignity of a great king ; in fact , he was an able and successful warrior ? more assiduous in war than his father , less careful for education and the arts of peace . Edward 's succession was resisted by Athelwald , a son of one of his father 's elder brothers ? a nearer heir according to modern ideas not then in force . He took possession of the royal vill of Wimborne , but fled upon the approach of Edward , and reach ing Northumbria was soon after acknowledged by the Northumbrians as their king . Three or four years later Athelwald landed in Essex and per-I20 RECOVERY OF ENGLISH SUPREMACY .

Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Kent , acting for themselves and against his orders , fought a fierce and equal battle with the Danes , in which both Eric and Athelwald were killed . The peace of Wedmore was thus broken by the Danes , who gave Edward provocation or ex-cuse for the strife and bloodshed of the years following . To set a barrier to their depredations was to re-establish the lordship of Wessex , and it became the work of his reign . He was well supported by Athelred and Athelflede of Mercia . They built fortresses , first upon their borders for their own defence , then within the Danish country for its subjugation . Athelred and his wife began by rebuilding and fortifying the city of Chester , ' which had lain in ruins for 300 years since its capture by Athelfrith , but was become as im-portant as ever for its command of the shortest road from Wales to the Danelaw .

Two years afterwards Edward fortified Hertford upon his border , and thence broke into the Danish territory of Essex , where he encamped while he built and fortified Witham . And Athelflede , following the same plan , fortified Bridgnorth , Tarnworth , Stafford , Warwick , and made them her supports in assaulting the Danish district of the Five Towns . Derby was taken by storm , and Leicester submitted . The English country people in serfdom to 1 ) anish lords gave strength to Edward by supporting his plans , or even by taking their own part iii the war , both in the defence of towns and in attacking others . They gathered from places around and attacked and burned Tempsford on the Bedford Ouse . From Kent , Surrey , and Essex they marched on Colchester and took it by assault . Maldon , occupied for King Edward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country around who drove the besiegers away . The Ealdorman of Mercia died early in the war ( 912 ) , his wife Athelflede seven years after him , and the conquest of the Five Towns was com-pleted by the King . Stamford was alarmed by a new fort on the south side of the river and sur-rendered ; Nottingham was taken and was made a town of English as well as of Danes ; and all Mercia , as already Essex and East Anglia , was brought back under subjection to the King of Wessex . Edward then advanced upon Northumbria by sending an army of Mercians to repair and occupy Manchester . ' All Northumbriastill including the // Lothians , sent in their submission ; the Scots be yond the Friths chose him as their father and over-lord , and were followed by the British king : Hid his people of Strathclyde . Edward thus lived to be King of England south of the Humber and over-lord of the rest of the island . But some of the submissions were empty promises , given as temporary expedients for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no more than the word of the king binding the people to do nothing , and to be repudiated by himself when convenient . Edward died about the end of 924.1 2 . Athelstan , the eldest son of Edward by an early but irregular marriage ( see Note K , Appen dix ) , was elected to succeed him . His boyish beauty and promise had gained him the affection of his grandfather Alfred , who had him educated under the eye of Athelflede . He began his reign by demanding the recognition of his supremacy from the kings who had submitted to his father . Sihtric the Danish king of Northumbria met him at Tamworth , and cemented their peace by marrying Athelstan 's sister Edith ; but upon Sihtric 's death within a twelve-month , Athelstan annexed Northumbria to his own kingdom , ex pelling Anlaf and Godfrith , sons of Sihtric by a former marriage . Anlaf ( or Olave ) fled to Ireland , Godfrith to Scotland , ' and both did all they could to stir up enemies against him . The other kings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ENGLAND . Welsh kings , and a king of Bamburgh ? according to one account not till after some hostilities , met him at Eamot ( Elmet ) , gave him their oaths , and " renounced all idolatry . " ' The peace lasted for some time . Eight years after , Athelstan , provoked by Constantine 's con-tempt of it , " invaded Scotland with a powerful army strong in cavalry , and wasted wherever he came . Ile compelled the Scottish king to pay him money and to give his son as a hostage . He also exacted a heavy tribute from the Welsh kings , and secured Egbert 's boundary of the West Welsh at the Tamar , expelling the Welsh from the city of Exeter . Athelstan 's encroachments led to a confederacy of the defeated kings .

The brief , dry narrative of the Chronicle breaks out into an unwonted strain of poetry . It tells how the fighting lasted from daybreak till night ; that five tributary kings and seven earls were slain ; and that " no greater slaughter or of more peoples ever took place in this island since the day // when the Angles and Saxons came over the broad seas . " Athelstan was the first king who could truly call himself King of England . The Danish irruptions resulted in the union of the country . The re-conquest of the Danelaw brought all the kingdoms into subjection to the King of Wessex , and for a short time without an under-king . The danger barely averted by the great battle showed that a united kingdom was not yet possible , and Eric " Bloody-axe , " a King of Norway expelled from his own kingdom , who landed opportunely , was taken to be half-king of Northumbria , conditional upon defending his province against Danes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king than solid advantage to the people . Foreign kings sought his alliance and married his four sisters . The virtues of Alfred , his triumphs and those of his son had stirred the people 's pride and prepared them for the popularity of Athelstan , No English king except his grandfather had so gained the affection of his subjects . He is celebrated as an example of the Anglo-Saxon beauty , with fine features , fair complexion , and golden hair rivalling the intertwining threads of gold ; a man also of genial , popular manners , lavish of his treasures , both to his friends and , more profusely and prudently , to the Church . The allies defeated at Brunanburh were not subdued . Within three years Athelstan was dead ; and his work had to be done over again , and more than once , by his two half-brothers Edmund and I26 HISTORY OF ENGLAND . Edred , whose successive reigns lasted about fifteen years . 3 . Upon the succession of Edmund , the elder of them , a young man of about eighteen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was received at York as king . From York he marched through Mercia , ravaging as he went , stormed and burned Tamworth , but he was besieged in Leicester , and fled by night along with Archbishop Wulfstan of York . The district of the Five Towns , with its Danish law-men or magistrates , was once more subjected , and then Mercia and Northumbria ; and Edmund , we learn , became mighty and glorious by the counsel of Dunstan . ' If he had older advisers we do not hear of them : Dunstan was a year or two younger than himself . Young as Edmund was , however , his later acts are in accord with a politic measure which was adopted at this time . Members of the Witan , of whom we do not hear particularly , must have concurred in it . King Edmund has the credit of a transaction not usual with the warrior-kings , which put a check upon inroads of the Welsh and Scotch . He invaded and subdued the part of Strathclyde then known as Cumberland , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malcolm the successor of Constantine , upon condition of hom-age and assistance in all war by sea and land . Malcolm was thus engaged by self-interest on the side of the English against the Welsh . // If the young king had any personal influence ill this politic transaction he must have inherited some of the wisdom of his grandfather . Whether or not , his tragic death the year following showed a want of common , not to say kingly , prudence . He was celebrating the festival of their saint ( Augustine ) at his ham at Pucklechurch in Gloucestershire , when Leof , a convicted robber condemned to banishment , entered the open hall and sat down in the company , in defiance of the king 's order for his removal , and with violence to the steward . Edmund himself sprang from his seat and rushed upon him but fell down dead , stabbed to the heart by the man 's dagger . 4 . Edmund left young children unfit to succeed him , and a moot of the Witan , in which Welsh half-kings and Danish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their king . The assembly came nearer to a " moot " of all England than any before it . The Northumbrians again seized the oppor tunity afforded by a new reign . Their Witan met at Tadcaster and swore fealty to Edred , but within a year they revolted and took Eric Haraldson as their king . They were punished with a severity quite unexpected . Edred over-ran all Northumbria , and even burned Wilfrith 's church of Ripon . In the event Eric was deposed by his own people . He was the last King of Northumbria . Worn out by dissensions and contentions with their neighbours , the northern nobles submitted to see their great kingdom reduced to an earldom , I28 HISTORY OF ENGLAND . and soon after cut down to the limits of our northern county . 5 . The warlike successes of Alfred 's son and grandsons had no effect in curbing the strife and disorder of the people among themselves . The Laws of Edward bear record of his request to the Witan to devise measures for the better keeping of the peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king 's peace is worse kept than is pleasing to me , and my Witan say that I have too long borne with it . " Edmund 's Laws have the same complaint ? " To me and to us all are exceedingly offensive the unrighteous and manifold lights that are among ourselves . " ' Of these manifold fightings we have heard the echoes from much earlier times . The freemen , impoverished by them , would often be driven to robbery and war upon the roads , and the laws deal with them accordingly . As early as those of Ina , they have their special provisions and punishments for thieves of a company not more than seven , for a " ploth " or gang of from eight to thirty-five , and for a larger number , accounted as a " here " or army . From the time of Ina recourse is had to punishments by bodily mutilation , so foreign to the old Germanic customs ; beginning with loss of hand or foot and gradually increased till , in the Laws of Knut , they reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even to scalping . At this time , however , the deliberations of the Witan , in response to Edward and his sons , 1 Laws of Athclstan , iv . ; Edmund , Secular , introduction . // resulted , not in greater severities of punishment , hut in measures to hinder the escape of accused persons from justice . The precautions taken were founded upon the ancient and long-enduring English custom of bail . By the early laws of Hlothh ere and Eadric of Kent a man accused of theft was required to give security to his accuser for his appearance to answer the charge before the Moot . The laws of Edward and Athelstan define the security . Every lord was responsible for his men ; but " of a lordless man , " the laws of Athel stan complain , " no law can be got . " It was therefore enacted by these two kings , with their Witan , that for one accused of theft and having no lord , his friends should be security ( " borh " ) , evidently in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he had no friends , then his goods and chattels were to be held in pledge ; if he had neither friends nor property , he was to be kept secure for his appearance . If , nevertheless , he fled from justice and could not be produced before the Moot , he was condemned as a " flyma , " or fugitive from justice , whom anybody might stay for a thief . ' In the later Anglo-Saxon times people inde pendent of lords but of themselves unable to give the required security , upon any charge against them were wont to combine in the method of mutual security called the " Frith-borg " ? in the North of England the " Tenmanne-tale " ? by which a company of ten men gave its united security for every member of it . The Frith-borg // is first mentioned in the Norman compilation called the " Laws of Edward the Confessor , " but it is mentioned under English names as already in use , and the Laws appear to be authentic .

DUNSTAN ? commonly called St. Dunstan , a younger man than King Edmund , for he was born about the first year of the reign of Athelstan ? was the principal manager of affairs in the reign of Edred , and was the guiding mind of the government for thirty years . He was the idol of his countrymen during his life , and their favourite saint for two centuries . Of a noble family , he spent some of his early years in a home of Athelstan 's , not far from the dilapidated church and buildings of the monastery of Glastonbury , where , with other high-born youths admitted for their education into the royal household , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who became his attached friend for life . A youth of genius , dwelling within view of the monastic buildings left in ruins by pagan Danes , 131 // he might well imagine to himself the picture of them as they had stood with their church and school ; and we can believe that his day-dreams suggested the vision , never forgotten by him , of a new church and cloisters to be reared there by himself . The place in its ruins was inhabited by a few Scotch or Irish monks , and Dunstan was for a time among their pupils . Ile was only twenty-two when Edmund made him Abbot of Glaston bury , with charge to rebuild the abbey and a promise of all needful help and of the restitution of its estates , which had fallen into the king 's hands . Dunstan took an active part in the work , and was reputed to be skilled in painting and music , in gold and metal work , in the casting of bells , and the construction of musical instruments called organs . He was thus employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the election of Edred , and was summoned to the court . Edred was a sickly man through life , and had need of a competent guide ; and Dunstan took the leading part in public affairs , refusing other honours and preferments that he might stand by the King . The reign has little of interest after the northern campaign , which shows , however , that its leader inherited some of the powers of his father and grandfather . It was his one achieve-ment ; after it he dragged out a wretched life rather than lived . He had reigned less than ten years , when feeling his end approaching , he sent for Dunstan and the royal hoard which was // in his keeping , that he might distribute it . Dunstan hastened from Glastonbury to find him dead , and the treasure fell to his successor . 2 . King Edmund had left two sons , young children , of whom Edwy the elder , celebrated for his Anglo-Saxon beauty and for his mis fortunes , was now a boy of about fourteen . His short reign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King 's kin and the nobles , and of factions of Wessex and Mercia . During Edred 's reign his mother Edgiva had with Dunstan taken a leading part in the govern ment . Edwy was found to be under the influence of a lady Athelgiva , of a high noble family and probably his foster-mother . ' She soon showed herself an energetic and ambitious woman ; and , it is likely , had already borne no good-will to Edgiva and Dunstan , the principal agents of King Edred , a younger brother of Edwy 's father . At all events , an angry feud now broke out between them . There was , in fact , a change of government : Dunstan and some of the nobles retired from the Court , but they returned to the coronation to be actors or witnesses of a memorable scene . After the religious ceremony , the boy-king was seated with his chief men at the usual banquet , when to their surprise he rose and left them in their cups ; and they heard that he had retired to the society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return . It is credible , after the scene at Pucklechurch , that he had seen // enough of the feast . But his retirement gave offence , and it was determined to request his presence . Dunstan was deputed , with Kinsig Bishop of Lichfield , one of the King 's kin , to bring him back , " willing or unwilling , " to his seat in the hall . The scene that followed is an old picture of early English history . In a chamber not far from the hall they found Edwy with the two women , mother and daughter ; his jewelled crown thrown carelessly upon the floor , as if he had found as little pleasure in the company he fled from as they in his retreat from it . He refused to go back to it , and Dunstan put the crown upon his head and drew him by the hand , while the women held him back , and the mother answered the Abbot 's reproaches with angry threats . The story of Edwy and Algiva which follows is coloured by the animosities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the one side , upon the authority of an anonymous writer , l forty years after the events and others much later , improbable accusations of gross indecency against a boy of fourteen or fifteen with a mother and her daughter , of whom the younger became his wife , " and with their doors open to all the company , many of them the mother 's political enemies ; then of her intemperate use of power , when for a // short time it fell into her hands ; of Dunstan returning to his abbey to find it in the custody of king 's bailiffs , and being served with a summons to render account of the finances of the late reign , and then , upon his flight , barely escaping the executioners sent with orders to tear out his eyes . ' Edwy also is accused of extortionate exactions and wrongful judgments against rich men , not sparing his own grandmother the widow of King Edward , and against cities , churches , and monasteries , with cruel expulsion of the monks . These accusations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mercia , who had been humiliated by the late hings of Wessex , when they saw an opportunity of re-asserting their right to elect a king of their own ; and , with the concurrence of the northern nobles , they pro-claimed Edgar , the younger brother of Edwy , King of Mercia and Northumbria . The accusations upon the other side arc also more or less coloured . Edwy was still the nominal king of Wessex , but so powerless that he was forcibly separated from his wife Algiva-it is said by soldiers of Archbishop Odo , or of a faction in concert with him . They branded her face and sent her to Ireland ; and when she escaped and was returning to her husband , recaptured her near Gloucester and ham-strung and cruelly murdered her . Edwy died soon after at the same place , and there are statements that he perished by violence and that he died broken-hearted. // There can be no doubt that atrocious deeds were done that might well have shortened his life . Archbishop Odo was a converted Dane , said to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the time of Alfred . We hardly know enough to justify the charges against him , that he attained the primacy of the Church before he had thrown off the temper of the savage Vikings , or that he was responsible for the cruel treatment of Edwy . IIc died before the worst deeds were ( lone . ' ; . Dunstan had found refuge in a monastery at G bent , w'bcre he heard that one-half of England was in revolt to Edgar , who with the Mercian Witan recalled him from his exile and promoted him to the see of Worcester , and soon after to that of London . He held them both till he became archbishop . Upon the death of Odo , Alfsin of Winchester was chosen to succeed him , but he perished of cold in passing the Alps on his way to Rome . Pyrhthelm , another bishop elected primate in Wessex , was set aside upon the death of Edwy , and under Edgar , now king of all England , Dunstan became the successor of Odo . The reign of Edgar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was peaceful and prosperous , and obtained for the King the name of Edgar the Peaceful , a title which most of the kings of his race would have accounted as anything but honourable . The name itself is an // indication of fresh ideas and a new ambition , and t herefore of a mind out of the usual habits of the kings . The ruling mind was Dunstan 's , and his policy was peace . He travelled from city to city , an eloquent preacher , teaching the people to be obedient to their lords , and the lords to rule them with justice ; administering justice himselfl and employing his Church revenues in works of charity to the poor and afflicted . But the calendar of national crime was not light . We hear of thefts , sacrilege , perjuries , frauds , poison-ings , parricides , adulterous murders of husbands . The copious narratives of Dunstan 's hagio-graphers are somewhat vague , but they all agree that he was the leading mind and the actual ruler of the kingdom , and the known transactions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality . The times immediately following looked to him as , even before Edmund died , the king 's adviser and guide . To Edred , he is the king de facto ; or , as one writer has it , " Quasi rex et regis imperator. " 2 He was as much so to Edgar , who with his Witan hastened his return , and endowed him with ample revenues from the Church , as if nothing could be done without his advice and help . The young King himself also , it is related , " made progresses through all the provinces " in the winter and spring , and inquired diligently concerning the administratian of justice , and whether the laws were observed by powerful men , so that the poor might not be wronged. // But the ordinary habits of Edgar were so different from this as to have suggested for him the name of Edgar the Wanton , instead of Edgar the Peaceful . The only transactions of his reign that can be put with confidence to his personal credit are his scandalous amours . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time they were so notorious that King Knut , who some years afterwards paid a visit to the nunnery of Wilton , where Hdith it daughter of Edgar had been abbess , laughed at hearing that she was a saint , and said he could never believe in the sanctity of it daughter of Edgar , a man so enslaved to his lusts and vices . ' The naval and military defences of the kingdom were well looked to , whoever did it . The coasts were protected by a large fleet in three squad:ons , which sailed every year from Easter-time and " circumnavigated the whole island " among them . The country breathed freely , under no fear of the terrible Northmen . The King himself led in one or two small military excursions . In one , he ravaged the Isle of Thanet for some offence . A more important expedition was into Wales , where the petty kings , having failed to pay their regular tribute , were allowed to commute it for an annual tax of three hundred wolves ' heads . In a few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . We discover the hand of Dunstan in a more important transaction , similar to that with Cumberland in the reign of Edmund . The old northern kingdom , already reduced to an earldom , was about this time divided into two ? one from the Humber to the Tees , the other thence to the Forth . Soon afterwards the northern earldom was sub-divided , with still greater advantage , by the creation of an earldom of Lothian , north of the Tweed , and its bestowal under fealty upon the Scottish king , who was to present himself once a year at the English Court , and had English homes given him with their estates upon the northern road for his lodgings on his journeys . It was a bold policy for English consolidation . The Scottish king , it was expected , would hold the Lothians as a subject of the King of England and would be engaged by his own interests to curb the restless Northumbrians . In the event , the effect of the measure was to enlarge the kingdom of Scotland . The Scottish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Borough as their capital . But they were not reduced to the position of English earls . The peace of Edgar , however , was maintained . The King of Scotland acknowledged his supremacy : the lesser kings of Wales and Strathclyde were submissive . When the Scottish king and seven others pulled the oars with Edgar for helmsman upon the Dee at Chester , Edgar felt and declared himself a king indeed . One event of the reign has given some trouble to the writers and readers of it ? Edgar 's corona-
