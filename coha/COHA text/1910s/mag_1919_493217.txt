Letters from a Miner 's Wife October 29 , 1919 . DEAR SIS : ? Just received your letter . Well , people here talk awful of the President . They say now la the time he can show his true colors . Some think we Will be off a long time and others say a week . Of course , You ca n't tell . Yes , they tried not to sell the wagons any coal , as always just before a strike . Said they did n't have the time . The men said , " ' Well , we have n't the time to load railroad ears then . " So they had to let us have it , as much as we could pay for . We got about seven tons . , No , the majority of miners have absolutely nothing ? ; ust depending on the storekeepers to carry them . We Kaye a good deal of fruit and beans and a barrel of flour and four hogs , so we can live a little while , I guess . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lewis a man ? Everyone is crazy about him . Yes , the mines are working good now ? just before strike , You know . augh Willis made a speech here last night . He told the men to sit still and hold their hands , there was seven 4 ; iiillion dollars for them and to use no violence . It seems all We think of is coal for winter . No , you can bet I ai n't got no clothes and never have far that matter , tho . Agnes S Jule is sitting here trying to eat your letter up h 1,37 is making airships of it . You should hear him call er Agnes Jule . She is growing so fast and her hair did n't t ale out and is as black as coal . Mrs. Jones declared she io ? Iced just like you . to Well , the weather is fine , lots of rain , we still got : aatoes and beans out of our garden , so you know the weather has n't been very cold here yet . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , it 0 alcs to me as tho the men would wake up to the fact that in order to live a miner should have his own store . Each local should have its own store instead of trading with /Ili lazy merchants . Make them go to work ? to my Ila , c1 that is the only way for a miner to live . Like a tale told about last night , about a fellow who took it upon himself to see how the miners live and if they needed a raise and he went back to report and said , " Why , the miners do n't need a raise . Some of them own their own homes and some of them even have their toilets in their houses . " They told that at the local meeting and one fellow got up and said , " Yes , that is our big men that we pay and that 's why we need a raise , to keep them up in style . " 0 , well , you know they ca n't make a miner work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are up against it this time for they will have to yield . Lewis said there was one way for this strike to be averted and that was for them to come across . They 've sure been making the money out of us . We do the work and they get the money , that is , the most of it . They only run the mines so much and they lay us off whenever they want to and then we eat up what we 've made the days we work . They never give us a chance to get ahead . I guess it does cost to live . Our store bill runs $50 and $60 a day ? how 's that for two weeks , and that 's not feeding six children any too much either . The police in Boston are sure having a time , are n't they ? Well , I guess we will all live till we die anyhow . Mary says tell you she would welcome any kind of a dress now as she sure does need it . When do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with the miners . The men are making pretty good money now , you know how it is just before a strike , they run the mines full time so they can stock up with coal and hold out all the longer against us . Of course , that lets us , make a little more , but what does it amount to , paying twice as much for what we eat ? jack had a good turn yesterday , but it did n't amount to much in a family of eight . Raising wages do n't seem to do any good the way the cost of living goes up , but then it would go up anyway and it seems all we can do is to try to keep up with it , tho we never can . If we only had steady work we might have a chance to live , but this thing of working four days this week , two the next and three the next and then weeks of no work ? well , we just ca n't live , that 's all . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't need , send it along . Well , I do n't know anything else , so ' I will close this time . Ans soon , Your Sis , Julia . Sixth Day of Strike . Nov. 6 , 1919 . Dear Sis : ? Am answering as soon as possible . Well , in regard to the strike , we are still out , as you know . The men say they would rather go back at the same wages and to get their six hours for if we could be sure of six hours every day it would sure make a difference . They are all crying out against Wilson now . On to the White House , they say . Everyone says they will vote a straight Socialist ticket this next time . Jack says he do n't want any more Democrats or Republicans , give him straight Socialists . No , indeed , they ca n't make the miners work and everyone is as contented as if we had a million dollars . The world owes us all a living and we will live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the U. S. for us to starve . Why , did n't we send our boys across to fight that we could be free . We would be fools to starve or freeze now . Why , only last night some guy drove up a box car and opened up and loaded up eight barrels of flour out of it . A little old nosey out at Virginia ran his legs off to tell on him . They caught him but this guy that told on him sure got it told to him . They called him a scab and everything and one fellow said , " Say , son , you 're young , ai n't you ? You 'll see lots of sights like that before this strike ends and if you take my advice , you 'll shut your eyes when you see it . " Of course , we 're not fixed for a strike , never would be , for that matter , they never give us enough work to lay anything ahead , but we can freeze them before they can starve us and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can beg unless they run an injunction against it . Everyone seems firm and they all think Lewis is a brick . You would think the men were out on a picnic , laughing and joking about the strike . Willie got up this morning and said , " Had breakfast , mamma ? " I said , " No . " He said , " Strike on ? " I said , " Yes . " He said , " I swear , I did n't think it would be for fifty years . " We got four hogs , and lots of fruit and flour . You ought to see my biscuits . Gee , they are good . Lots of people are talking of each local having its own store , but they all say they need a leader and they are asking Red where you are , would you come . Do n't you think the only way the miners will ever have anything is to get each local a store of their own ? Do you think you can come ? Red wants to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sick today and last night , too . I guess she is cutting teeth . So many babies are dying now . I am making light bread . Smell it ? Ann is up now and looks some better . She sure has got her hands full with four men to do for . I see in St. Louis they are about out of coal . Well , they know how to get it . Jack and Red said they could use their tools . Will write again soon . Your Sis , Julia . Eighteenth Day of Strike . Nov. 18 , 1919 . Dear Sis : ? Rec 'd your letter today and must say it Was fine . I have been expecting it for quite a while but was glad to get it . Well , Sis , we are still out and everyone seems perfectly satisfied . You ca n't hear a word of complaint at all , do n't even ask each other about work . Everyone seems to have plenty ? course , we have n't , but we could have less . Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not have called the strike off , he should have gone to jail , for the men would n't tap a lick till they got him out . Anyway , the men wo n't go back . Sis , do you reckon you will get home by the time we kill hogs , Christmas , anyhow ? A lot of people are killing now . Well , Sis , people are radical around here now . They have deceided that miners have a right to live and you should see the way they attend any kind of a meeting and they are sure strong for union leaders . Yes , Pop received his $25 . Wish it had been mine . You bet those things came in handy , especially the shoes . Mary and I were both barefooted almost . I gave the pumps to Ann and the shoes to Mary and the oxfords to myself . I took that corduroy skirt and made Ty an overcoat and pants and the jersey dress just fits me . OPal took the blue serge dress and Mary the velvet dress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get . I took that brown coat of mine , changed the belt , and the pockets , and hemmed it up for Mary . Jack said to tell you he had five loads of wood and he would give you a load if you would come after it . Cooling ? Agnes knows her name now . You an call her Agnes and she just laughs . Today Ty said , " Mamma , who are you talking to ? " I said , " To myself . " " Do you ever talk to yourself ? " and he said , " Sometimes I talk to 3 dime . " You know he do n't like nickles or pennies. nut I do n't guess he 'll ever have as much as his namesake , the great Ty Cobb , do you ? Well , I wonder if they can run an injunction on the miners and make them work . Maybe they would like to put them in jail . Would n't they have a bunch ? Someone robbed Eisenstein 's store Saturday night tu $6,000 worth ? wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they think of the rank and file now . They do n't need any leaders . And the women are just as strong as the men , too . Paving is going on here . They are putting up a big brick building and they 're building a theatre so there is considerable work just now but our men ca n't be Well enough to get on . Thanksgiving and Christmas look blue now . Maybe ' tho , it will come out all right . Ty says he must have all icicle , he calls it , and Agnes must have a doll for Xmas ' I guess the rest can do without . Red said ask you if you would be home Christmas . We all want to see you . You 've been gone a century , it seems to me like . Thurs . Eve . The men are still holding faithful and I do n't believe December 24 , 1919 THE NEW they will be back at work until the first of the month and Pa says the first of the year . Got all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It just fit her . Jack took the mackinaw . I have n't decided on the other coat but they all come in handy , you can bet . So ans soon . Well , this is all I know . Agnes is crying . I know that . Your Sis , Julia . Thirtieth day of Strike . Dear Sis : ? Strike is still on as you can see by this Paper , but Willie says it is the best kind to write on , so here goes . We are still out and I do n't belieVe we will be back at work before the first of the year . There was a meeting here last night . I did n't know it 10 time or I would have gone . I do n't know anything that was said . I have n't heard . Everyone is well satisfied yet . Of course , the storekeepers have n't yet shut us off . But anyway the miners have been through strikes without storekeepers and surely if We went through the strikes of the bygone days when ' we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no nothing , surely we can go through the longest kind of a one these days . We'll. never give in . They ought to know that about miners by this time . They 've starved us before . In fact , we 've always lived from hand to mouth , so We 'll live somehow . We had a good Thanksgiving , ? gnose , oyster dressing , pie and cake ? all on credit ; but still good . I am afraid we wo n't have such a good Christmas , . : " . I ' would like for the kids to have something but I do n't see any chance at all . They talk of bringing the troops to prote , ..... , the men who : want to work , but where are the men who want to work ? Not one around here . People say they can lay out as long 4 the people can do without coal . They ask Lewis if the men are prepared for a long strike . Why . ai nt we ? Do n't they give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least , that is what they tell the public . There are a lot of cartoons around here . Everyone seems to be having lots of fun out of it . You ca n't tell t ere is any trouble at all . You ca n't hear anything , no theyof a strike , unless you ask , and then they 'll say , 0 , Fell , go to work by the first of the year . vv eB , we could make out , I guess , if the boys had ? thee , but maybe they can make out till it is over . Wish you could see Agnes . She is as fat as a pig and as P , ratty as can be . Ty and Willie are as mean as ever . They hey are feeling now around here that Lewis did , right because the miners would n't go back anyway . This is the ininer ' s strike , not Lewis ' strike , but the Government and the Public do n't seem to know that . Wonder if they know now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to how them . Sis fur You 're not coming home for Christmas , ' hogs are fine . We will sure have some When We do kill them . We have lots of fruit , saw a cartoon about sugar , you know we ti3 ' at all now . The cartoon showed a woman in war , 11 ! at the store . The grocer said , " Two pounds of sugar month to each one in war time . " Then in peace time REPUBLIC ' ' 9 he says , " No sugar at all . " Well , I will dose . If you can get some stamps , I will write again right away . Lee said tell you that Mackinaw sure was warm . He just got through sewing buttons on it . He said tell you he was in the shoe business now , he fixed six pairs last week , but they were all thank you jobs . Ans soon . Your Sis , Julia . Nov. 14 , 1919 . Dear Sis : ? Your letter and book both received a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was very glad to get check . Said it came in handy as we were trying to pay for that place and it wo n't take long now if they start to work soon and I believe they will for I believe we have got them whipped now . I notice that the public is coming over to our side a little no since Lewis called the strike off . I think he used good judgment by calling it off , he knew the men would n't work anyhow and it kept him out of jail and also turned some of the outsiders to our side . I guess the operators would have been glad if he had n't called it off , but he was too smart for them . I wonder how they like the way we went to work . This is the quietest strike I ever saw . The people around here are n't worried a bit . They will never weaken a bit . Well , you never said if you got my letter or not . Pop wanted you to see a Red Cross worker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Julia and Mary got the clothes and shoes . When do you think you will get down here into the wilderness again ? Will close for this time as I want to get this mailed . Expecting an early reply , I am Your Bro , Tom . Dec. r , 1919 . Dear Sis : ? Your letter received and was very glad to hear from you . IATe are all enjoying fine health and getting along fine . We are having nice weather , plenty of good rest , and eating three times a day . I think Julia was wrong about Lewis . It is a settled fact that if he had n't called off the strike they would put him in jail and it would have done us no good either . You see before we came out the operators said the men did n't want to come out , but our officers made us come out . So now since he called off the strike I guess they see that the men did n't want to work so bad . Do n't you let anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing . He had already found out if the men were strong enough to stay out if he called it off , said that if they were not , he would n't call it off and would go to jail . Of course , there are not many that know that he got in touch with the men after the injunction was served on him . I certainly think we will win the strike and both Pop and I think that by him calling it off will be the means of winning it . Yes , you bet . I think Lewis has got all of ' them cheated , if he do n't change . I like that little paper . That Captain and Lieut have got the same idea as I have about this military training business . I will dose for this time , expecting an early reply , I am , Your Bro , Tom .
