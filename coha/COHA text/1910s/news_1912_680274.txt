txt The time of the announcement of Canada 's contribution to the Imperial Navy may not improbably be related to the Balkan war situation , but the principle involved in the form and terms of the contribution is the ripening of seed sown long ago . Canadian statesmen visiting the motherland have said publicly that the British Empire had long ago outgrown its organization , and that it was in need of rejuvenation with the assistance of the children of the Empire . Accordingly we now have the formal proposal of the daughter of the Empire whose Premier considers it a - grown-up , " competent to discuss imperial policies level-eyed in the mother 's house . Canada is to contribute to the imperial navy the cost of three of the best warships that money and skill can produce . The terms of the contribution in aid are that Canada shall have a permanent member of the Imperial Defense Committee , who shall be consulted on all important questions of war and peace . Obviously what is conceded to Canada . can not be withheld from other dominions- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it has been known to our generation . If the full possibilities are realized the result might be such as imagination can conceive of if our colonies , the present United States , , - had secured representation in the imperial councils instead of having been driven into independence . It is no ordinary question raised by the action of Canada . It is more than an imperial question ; it is a world question . It challenges remark that the proposal which the Dominion Commons now has before it has been condemned repeatedly . The Premier of the United Kingdom has declared that imperial relations would be thrown Into chaos if it were necessary to consult the various dominions on imperial matters . Australia rejected the idea of a contribution to an imperial war force , and declared that it must be allowed to develop its own defenses as its sole contribution to the common defense . This meant more than the words indicate , for the interests of Australia are opposed to those of the Oriental ally of the Empire . Canada also heretofore has been opposed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predecessor joined in a naval polka/ of a Canadian navy for Canada . Mr. BORDEN is reversing himself , and is proposing a partisan policy . when he suggests-financial aid to the British Navy . It is an odd proposal . Canada must borrow the money , probably in England , and it is proposed to spend it in British shipyards , for warships to be attached to the imperial navy . The announcement is made in a manner almost humiliating to the Empire . The suggestion is that the Empire is unequal to the burdens which it has borne since time immemorial . The price that England pays is the price that ASQUITIT rejected , and a considerable payment already has been made on account . Not only has Canada been assured of admittance to the imperial defense council , but considerable progress has been made in reversing the economic policy upon which the present Government holds its popular mandate : ** Canada 's initiative the Imperial Trade Commission has been reorgan &d; in the manner proposed for the Empire . The freetrader who was appointed Chairman has been forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform , meaning British protectionism , sometimes called Chamberlainisni or imperial preference . The mother country has condescended to modify its intolerance on the question of taxing food , and to consider giving Canada a preference . Englishmen are to eat dear food in order that Canada 's prices may be raised . The price that Canada pays is no less repugnant to settled ideas . With Canadian battleships in the line , the Dominion is thrown into the vortex of European militarism from which it has recoiled as from a witches ' caldron . Canada heretofore has considered that , like ourselves , she had primary interests apart from those of the unhappy neighbors across the ocean Who can not move without treading on each other 's toes . Canada has conceived that the motherland might have quarrels from which the Dominion might abstain , thereby exercising something like an implication of veto on unapproved war . It is difficult to distinguish between a country and its colonies , but if that be possible it may be imagined that in such a case the United States might throw the shield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps insist upon the right of its own neutral trade , especially in foodstuffs , being undisturbed . But in the abhorrent hypothesis of a battle with Canadian warships engaged it would be difficult to maintain that Canada itself could not be attacked , at least up to the point where our interests became involved , or that the Empire had not exposed itself to the risk of starvation by depriving us of - the right to insist upon non-interference with our trade . The Right Hon. Roisenr BORDEN has good reason for wishing a safe deliverance from the crisis which he will find it easier to produce than to resolve . In the name of loyalty ho has raised a spectre in whose company it may be necessary for him to campaign the French constituencies already hostile on a much more moderate suggestion , and the Western constituencies who are in revolt because of the strangling of their trade for the benefit of the British connection , thus made distasteful . It will be easier and more agreeable to reject his advice than to admit that the situation of either the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implies .
