IN turning over the few pieces of early fiction which have survived the wrack of things , one marvels constantly as to what it is that has preserved them , for , to the great limbo of ideas and emotions where that which has striven to be art has not yet come to be , prose fiction has , perhaps from the very elasticity of its form , contributed more than any other form of art . What right perception of life has found expression here , we ask , in taking up the unforgotten novels ; what fortunate accident of form has given such perception tangible shape , crystallizing experience into a fine definiteness of outer shape which keeps these tales from melting back , as so many thousand others have done , into the untreated ? Up to a certain point the question is not hard to answer , as we think of mere line and texture ; beyond that it is mystery , as the ultimate charm of creative work must always be . As the line of immortal story-tellers files past , with Cervantes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain keenness in observing human life , a certain sweetness in interpreting the bizarre spectacle , and a gift of presenting in very great detail this sane and balanced view of things . Of Defoe it was said , in a phrase which admirably defines the true art of fiction , that he had the gift of lying like truth , ' and Defoe has captivated the imagination of all generations between his time and ours . His was the art of making the unreal , perhaps even the impossible , more evident than that which happens before your very eyes , sou because amazing improbabilities are told with such close attention to immediate detail that you can but believe ; and , by the side of his fictitious tales , newspaper accounts of actual happenings seem , in their sketchy presentation , unreal and improbable . How many ways they had of lying like truth , ' those earlier English writers of fiction !

From that realism of petty , practical detail which delights us in Robinson Crusoe , from the crude rendering of emotion in Richardson 's work , down to the subtle intellectual processes of Meredith 's characters , one marvels at the many and the varied ways in which our novelists have learned to lie like truth , ' making the very stuff of daily life visible and tangible , and tracing , thought by thought , the processes of the mind . As one ponders on the deeper aspects of the question , thinking of the inner truth or vision thus wrought out into concrete form , of Jane Austen 's finely balanced sense of things , of Thackeray 's pungent sweetness of interpretation , of Meredith 's penetrative wisdom , the sanity and depth of our elder novelists become as true a measure of our later work as does their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form . Searching , among the novels of the last six months , for the truth that comes from close observation , one finds it nowhere more apparent than in Myra Kelly 's Little Aliens , ' a book of tales , like her others , dealing with children of the East Side in New York . It was , ranted to this author , through her , gift of insight , to become the interpreter of a generation of young Americans of alien blood and alien faiths , and it is largely to her sweet and sane sympathy that we owe our knowledge of hose nearly they are kin to what is best and finest in us ; how often they are , in their untutored gentleness , our betters . This author 's gift of creeping to the very inner consciousness of these small folk is one not likely to be granted to another , and her early death is the more to be regretted as it means the loss of one who could help bridge the gulf between races . The humor and the pathos of the tales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thought and of feeling gives the work always high artistic veracity . Close study , careful use of detail , are evinced in Alice Brown 's Country Neighbors , ' and many faithful touches of description and characterization make time , place , and people real . One Clads here a certain monotony of emotion , for the author , wisely perhaps , keeps to the minor key , and there is more suggestion of phases of life which her people have escaped , or have lived through long ago , than of those which they are living . The same quiet sentiment and gentle humor that characterize these tales are found in her latest novel , John Winterbourne 's Family . ' Here is free play of fancy , affectionate picturing of whimsical character , and a picturesque combination of homely New England experiences with hints of Greek myth . The book is longer and more elaborate than most of Miss Brown 's tales , yet the gain in dramatic interest does not seem proportionate to the length , and the novel confirms the belief that she is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who can lie like truth , ' we take up The Depot Master , ' by Joseph C. Lincoln . Here the homely sights and sounds of shore life are pictured , but , as the author turns over his stock-in-trade of old-sailor qualities and sailor words , one can not help feeling a lack of freshness in the presentation . A certain zest and originality must go to the making of fiction that will live , and it is well not to use too often details used many times before . As one surveys the same articles cooking in the same utensils , the same nets drying on the shore , and listens to the same rustic expressions , the sky of New England seems unnecessarily contracted , and the thought suggests itself that possibly the material and the art of Myra Kelly point the way in which freshness may come back to our fiction , through the study of other nationalities coming into contact with our own . Keeping in mind the one idea , the firmness and closeness of detail that bring in fiction an effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the books of the season . More than one starts out admirably , giving the very stuff and substance of life , then falters into commonplace generalization , as , possibly , the author 's mem- ory , and keen sense of childhood 's experiences , give way to fancy . The Right Stuff , ' for instance , by Ian Hay , is quite the right stuff in the first chapter and the last , vital , close to reality ; but all between is the wrong stuff , a tale of society life in London , having no special charm , and bearing no trace of the first-hand knowledge and observation that mark the beginning and the end . More deeply disappointing , because failing in more ways , is Poppy , ' by . Cynthia Stockley , with its most interesting opening chapters . The very look of the sunburnt land of South Africa , with its still air , the bare kopje , ' the mimosa trees , and the very soul of a child , hurt , tired , overworked , are revealed , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record of human experience worth sharing . Then , suddenly , the tale loses its hold on the concrete , and turns into a bit of decadent literature , fortunately far less vivid than the early part , with one or two chapters which make one sorry to see upon the book the imprint of the fine old firm whose clean-minded literature was the solace of our childhood . As the new heroine with tendrilly ' hair replaces the passionate child , we pass from the realm of real observation and real experience , and enter a made-up world , where much is generalized and much is borrowed . Luce Abinger is an absurd combination of Charlotte Bronte 's Mr. Rochester and Mrs. Voynich 's hero in The Gadfly . The manners of the former , the distorted face , the scar , the stammer of the latter , make up a rather formidable creature who possesses all gifts save that of reality , to quote I know not whom . Have our later novelists not patience enough to go on observing for themselves , that they must thus rifle earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of close study which makes Miss Montgomery 's Kilmeny ' less appealing than Anne of Green Gables . There was a distinctness about the former , an artistic truth in the portrait of the quaint child with individual fancies . This story is pretty and fanciful , in the green and gray setting of a Prince Edward Island orchard , but vagueness replaces the close rendering of real things , and , in spite of the poetic touch , the tale does not hold the reader . Only the genuine poet , one to whom the invisible is more real than the visible , dare write the story ' all made up of the poet 's brain . ' Something of the glamour attending the stirring tales of brave knights and lovely ladies attaches to Mr. Chambers 's story of the Civil War , Ail , a Paige . ' Highly spiced to suit the popular taste , both in the rendering of sentiment and in the presentation of the horrors of war , it betrays more effort to produce a sensation at all costs than to achieve a fine quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best . A new story by the author of The Inner Shrine " is sure to rouse interest this year , if not next year or the next . This tale , like the earlier one , begins in a tensely dramatic situation , full of sensational elements ; then drifts into a narrative whose chief interest lies in the character-development . This novel is , on the whole , better than the earlier one , though neither is of especially fine quality , and the character-study is none too profound . Both are full of what might be called a ' light seriousness , ' well fitted to make a popular appeal . Giving the life-history of a man wrongly accused of murder , and of the woman N110 loves him throughout , it employs somewhat hackneyed materials with a certain air of freshness . The heroine , in her scorn of man-made laws , and her deep insight into real laws of action , betrays more originality than ( IOC , : anything else in the book , but the hero 's character is so blurred and indefinite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How far removed is most of the workmanship in the book from close picturing of reality ! How evidently it lacks the specific touch that creates ! It belongs with those bits of pottery whose edges login to crumble before they leave the maker 's hand , and which slip back easily , after brief use ; into the elements from which they emerged . Careful study of local conditions , people , scenery , appears in more than ? ale novel of the season . Cavanagh , Forest Banger , ' brings to us something of the mountain heights , the clear air , the distances of the West . Roaring Fork , Nebraska , and the mountains that guard it are the scene of a tale full of picturesque and stirring incident , dealing with the struggle between the old West and the new , the lawlessness or the old order , and the fine patriotism that means obedience to law . Fierce struggles for land and pasture are depicted ; murder , by supposed reputable citizens , of Mexican sheep-herders , carnage , recklessness , fidelity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , embodiment of the nation 's deermination that law shall prevail , rides ( lcvanagh , the Ranger . It is an interesting story , with a certain vitality , much realistic detail , and often beauty of line and color . Even if we find here no new and original nature-sense , no new interpretation of human character , there is a breeze-like quality of enthusiasm in the tale , and there is pleasure in sharing the wide spaces of the range . Another local study appears in By Inheritance , 2 by Octave Thanet , a story of the South . Despite its charm , it is frankly polemical , a plea against thrusting upon the Negro the white man 's lot , and everywhere , expressed and unexpressed , runs through it the thesis that , at any cost , the races must be kept distinct . The author has the genuine story-teller 's gift , and here artistic definiteness lends itself in unobtrusive ways to the interpretation of grave matters . This truth-telling observation might well give pause to far-away theorists and idealists , stoutly maintaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The subsequent misery of the young colored man who was educated at Harvard does not , perhaps , convince the stubborn Northern mind that all purely intellectual education for the Negro is wrong ; but the author brings , even to those who disagree with her , an uncomfortable sense that she knows more about some aspects of the matter than they do , and that those who plan for the future of this unfortunate race would do well to learn from those who have lived with it . Meanwhile , the book is an interesting example ? in its record of actual word and phrase , act and thought , of the people it depicts ? of ' lying like truth . ' An unusual kind of reality may he found in The Thief of Virtue , ' by Eden Phillpotts . Looking back at the author 's earlier tales , one detects a growing subtlety in his peculiar identification of human lives with the life of nature . In this lingering study of experience , the little group of people of whom he writes are almost completely swayed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet the act of wrong in which the book centres becomes sin because of dim spiritual forces , differentiating them from the earth to which they are closely akin . It is the story of one Henry Birdwood , whose slight grip on the things of the spirit is loosened by an act of passion and of revenge ; of Philip Ouldsbroom , hero of the tale , a very incarnation of physical forces , who faces in bewilderment the tragic issues of life ; and of his wife Unity , in whom natural instincts , greater than herself , work out transgression . The hero 's pathetic effort to father the child that he thinks his own makes one feel the depth of the natural tie , and realize anew how deeply rooted is human life in the soil . This is a close rendering of human experience , ' a dream of life mating with matter . ' It is not mere intellectual truth that is worked out , but organic truth , the facts of plant-life reproduced in human life , and all subdued to art . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaping the fruits , are rendered with such an effect of reality , that you feel as if grass and rock were growing sentient . If Mr. Phillpotts takes you constantly back to hours when mind was mud , ' he also carries you all the way from clod to rudimentary soul . It is this gleam of forces other than purely physical which differentiates his work from that of his master , Hardy , in whose novels man and his nature are identified with the soil , having a weed 's choice , no more . In The Thief of Virtue a slow evolution , reaching even to spirit , is suggested ; and the very beauty and vastness of the moor , constantly kept before you , help bring before you something of Mother Nature 's final sweet philosophy in the harmony which works out from even the blunders and the sin . you are aware of ruined sheepfold , croft ' . lech , menhir , of human life and of earlier life that have come and gone , and you share the gray and green ancient wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often blurred , and in method he is sometimes one of the ' Children of the Mist . ' At times he seems striving to reveal the lightning flash of soul through matter ; at times the tale so wavers as the hero fumbles blindly along the ways of life , that the reader becomes as uncertain of the way as he , and wonders whether , after all , the author had the deep meaning divined earlier in the book . Yet Mr. Phillpotts 's work grows clearer as the years go on , his manner more masterly and more reserved . His style has richness and depth , often great beauty . It has been , in many ways , an unfortunate year in the world of fiction . A number of so-called ' genuinely American ' stories have appeared , in all their futile smartness of phrase and of adventure ; the impossible has happened in that Mr. W. J. Locke has written a romance almost without charm ; and Mrs. Gertrude Atherton has produced an epoch-making novel that places her , her admirers say , among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy philosophy , which heretofore has seemed a divine accident , he destroys its potency , and Simon the Jester is a very tired jester , content to go labeled lest the hearers should not understand . As for Mrs. Atherton , there are immortals and immortals ; Dante , it will be remembered , recognized several kinds . The four hundred and sixty closely printed pages of her Tower of Ivory't ell the story of a young English diplomat who meets at the Bavarian court Margarethe Styr , an opera-singer , is interested in her , then marries a shallow young American girl , whom he finally deserts for Margarethe Styr . The tale , wide in scope , is intended to be tremendous in motif , and has been so pronounced by more than one critic . It must be remembered , however , that a great part of our public , lashed by the scorn of many a cosmopolitan , Mrs. Atherton among them , would perhaps be ready to welcome as strong ' any novel which presents a husband 's desertion of his wife at her hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , that this act in itself does not constitute greatness , either in life or in fiction , and that to tell this tale so that it would rouse , in finer minds , anything except disgust , the power of a supremely great master of tragedy would be necessary . This power Mrs. Atherton does not possess . Now and then in literature appears a study of human experience which makes one feel t he irresistible power of the great titles of life . From the old Tristram tale , down through some of the master dramas of the days of Elizabeth , to ' foist oi 's Anna Karenina , the type is familiar , and we are indeed purged by pity and terror as we follow breathlessly the working of passion that is fate . We do not feel this here . The author fails to make the impelling force of passion real , and the tale turns , at the end , where its power should be greatest , into a revolting spectacle of cold-blooded brutality . There is little in the character of John Ordham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which makes inevitable this ending when the wife and new-born child lie dead . When the hero goes to Paris , on his way to Margarethe Styr , instead of northward , as he had said , to his brother 's sickbed , one can not tell whether it is anger with his wife that makes him change his plans , or love for the other woman , or inability to manage the railway timetable . There is no possible reason why the singer should not have ridden her horse to death a few days earlier , and so have spared a deal of trouble . That inevitability which alone justifies such an ending is lacking both in character and in event . This is preminently the kind of fiction in which the second-rate will not do , and second-rate the book is , in management of motif , in character-delineation , and in style . The fine truth-telling of which we have been speaking is absent ; here is none of the pitiless veracity in detail which gives Anna Karenina its peculiar power , nor is there that underlying sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that artistic truth , in the last analysis , harmonizes with ethical truth . In The Tower of Ivory there is a remoteness about the characterization ; the hero is vaguely and negatively done , and , in spite of all that is said about John Ordham , you do not at the end know him better than you know any self-centred and reticent English traveler with whom you may have shared a railway carriage . The minute rendering of character in thought and act which would make his manner of choice at the end seem inevitable is lacking , and one can but conclude that the author has not had the opportunity for close observation , from which a character-study can be built up point by point , and that she lacks the fine quality of penetrative imagination which can project a character in its wholeness to act in least things and in great as a personality . The tale makes the impression of being morally and artistically underbred . This shows in the characterization , in the dramatic scenes , and in the style . ' She wept , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ; and again , She tore and gnawed her handkerchief until her gown was strewn with lint . ' This seems an artistic as well as an economic extravagance . The handshake and smile , the challenging glance at herself , caused the depths of the desperate woman to swarm with fighting devils , rushing on their armors , and polishing their swords ! ' Poor lady ! Surely here we are wandering out of the realm of tragedy , which this tale purports to be , into the region of melodrama . The many ways in which the style of the book falls short of fineness might be instanced as a reason for doubting its immortality . It is possible to find ungrammatical sentences , but perhaps that is a minor point . English , wherein three adjectives are used where one would do , three phrases , where one would be far better , will , fortunately , not endure . Lengthy prose descriptions are added to the already complex texture of the Wagner drama , and Wagner dramas set to adjectives are hard to bear . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand style , but there is nothing of that here , only a lashing and straining of language to an impotent fury of ink . The lack of fastidiousness in thought and in language would alone bar the book from the first rank . The constantly reiterated ' revealing gown , ' and ' a more perishing languor ' might well date from the days of debased English and debased morals of the time of Charles II , while , ' If their brains were not in a state of toxic poisoning from this love secretion ' betrays a vulgarity which could date only from our own century . Possibly all the points suggested in regard to the style could be summed up in one further quotation : ' But when the rich soil of a woman 's nature , long covered with the volcanic ashes of old passions , is sprouting with the roses and the toadstools of a new passion ? ' Ah , when that is happening , would it not be well perhaps to wait for a saner moment in the life of the heroine before writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cosmopolitan in material , cosmopolitan in point of view , gives pause for thought . There has been of late much discussion by Mrs. Atherton and others of the narrow provinciality of our taste . Scoffed at for domesticity , timidity , innocence , and other defects , we are hastening to make good our lack , for , full of a sense of uncertainty as to right critical standards , we are greatly afraid of not being up-to-date in matters of culture . As the fashion of these later days points to decadent literature , literature in which the sins and shortcomings of humankind arc dealt with admiringly , or flippantly , a , the case may be , we strive to achieve a taste for it , and are greatly abashed when we can not . No race has ever achieved great literature by following foreign fashions , and a greater fear than the fear of not being up-to-date might well possess us , the fear of forgetting our own point of view , the fear of failing to find expression in literature for that which has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's great pieces of fiction bequeathed to us by the past , one realizes that each , from whatever country , is fundamentally true to race-consciousness ; each contains sonic fine rendering of the heart of life as thi , people has discovered it . Don Quixote is Spanish to the core ; the very soul of the country is revealed here so clearly that , in chance meeting with a Spaniard of to-day , you understand him better for having known the Don . 110 ? ? essentially English are Gulliver and Robinson Crusoe ! How vastly , in each case , the wonders gain because of the practical , stolid character of the hero who faces them ! How Russian in every fibre , un-English and un-French , is Anna Karenina ! In each case the close rendering of an individual 's sense of things , through this detailed ' lying like truth , ' expresses also something of this i , cople 's peculiar contribution to human tAperience , and so takes on a larger meaning and a greater value . Pondering this truth , one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory and her practice . Our own tradition will serve us better as a starting-point than a borrowed one ; it may be a poor thing , but it is our own , and it is our only legitimate I , asis for art . I do not mean that we should confine ourselves to American material or to American soil , but that we should not borrow a point of view , nor imitate the thought or the emotions of other peoples . I doubt if we shall el er be able to deal with the sins and the shortcomings of humankind admiringly or flippantly . There is , happily , enough of morality and of decency in our tradition to forbid our thinking ; his way , and our race-consciousness under all the shift and change of fashion is as true as is great drama to the underlying laws of life . As for studies of human passion , what American has done , or can do them , in the French way , the German way , the Russian way ? It is well that our artists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human life which they have had the opportunity to observe , those aspects of experience that they understand . Keen observation , close analysis , delicate psychological detail in dealing with moral and mental and physical dilemmas , one finds in the best of our fiction , and we have had more than one writer capdble of telling a good story that is all story ; but passion , simple and entire , has been greatly rendered and dramatically rendered by no Amer-tone . William Dean Howells , Edith Wharton , Henry James , ? the very names that stand highest on our brief roll of fame , ? illustrate and prove the point ; and the lesser American novelists would do well to avoid that of which our best and wisest have fought shy . Even Hawthorne , who comes nearest to passion-study in the one great romance which our country has produced , The Scarlet Letter , begins the tale at the point where the modern novelist would leave off ? the moment when passion is over . How deeply , in its spiritual interpretation of experience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England ! How inevitably , like an unerring finger-post , does it point the way in which our novelists must deal with these themes if they are to interpret our finer sense of things . Singularly enough , the next book at hand is a satire , and an exceedingly clever one , on our American fear of not being abreast with the world in matters of culture . Franklin Winslow Kane I is quite in line , in its fine analytical work wherein minute shades of individuality are recorded , with the best that has been achieved in American fiction . It has been written that the disciple shall not be greater than the master , yet there are moments when the pen of Anne Douglas Sedgwick weaves a more potent charm than that of Henry James . Her work , more restricted in range , is now and then , if one dare whisper it , keener in insight , while the incisive workmanship sometimes betrays by contrast the labyrinthine nothingnesses of the master 's work in some of its lesser phases . With an almost uncanny insight into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of perception of shades and values . Her American heroine , cultured far beyond her ability to receive culture , groping for standards , afraid of not showing the finest judg- ments , might be regarded as a symbol of our national tendency to imitate in all matters of the mind . ' She had . . . so little stuff in her ; it was as if she had to find it all the time in other things and people . .. . She wants something , but she does n't know whether it 's what other people want or what she wants , so that she ca n't want anything very definitely . ' Her way of appealing to the Englishwoman for her opinion , changing her attitude toward her would-be lover , Kane , as she knows the other 's esteem for him waxes or wanes , is a bit of character-delineation as subtle as it is painful , and the fashion in which the Bostonian setter of standards is betrayed as having none of her own is masterly . There is here a keenness of insight that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kane , one might say that she was unsympathetic , and indeed one does not find here a tender Thackerayan sympathy with the very failings of humankind that are being exposed . As for the hero , he is done too much in extremes , being a shade too homely and a shade too good . We should feel more akin to him if he had some touch of inner defect to match the outer ; there is a Grandisonian perfectness about him that irritates , and one regrets that there could not be as delicate a shading in this picture of extreme goodness as in the picture of feminine weakness . Nowhere does Miss Sedgwick 's skill show more clearly than in developing the predicaments of her plots from the inner characteristics of her people , The causal relationship between character and event is , of course , the final test of dramatic work , and this author has rather unusual power in tracing the flowing of will into action . The touch of character on character , the fine play of shifting emotions that result in choice are subtly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lovers weave and interweave dramatic complications bring a delight in the artistry to mingle with the human sadness at the pathos of it all . Miss Sedgwick 's style has always great charm in its clearness of stroke and its deftness of expression . Its distinction makes the English of many of the other books of the season seem either slip . shod or tawdry . The intellectual and moral fastidiousness of the author result in a kind of work greatly needed in the America of to-day , and it will make for fine things , for in it life , character , and motive are held steadily to a standard of reality , of honesty , the comic spirit ' working in sad sincerity , separating the true from the false , the honest from the dishonest , the tine from the less fine . It is with a certain refreshment of spirit that one welcomes Enchanted Ground , ' by Harry James Smith , which brings with it a breath of fine , clear air from the New England hills . Something of the best that was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a background of contemporary New York , ? a sense of the worth of the struggle , of the greatness of the end . The workmanship is uneven ; there is perhaps too much of that light sketchiness of method that characterizes many of our writers ; but humor and pathos mingle in more than one episode in the book as naturally as they do in life , and talent is evinced which will doubtless work out in more sustained efforts . Above all , one feels thankful for an honest attempt to build up fiction upon our own , not upon borrowed , standards . The story is finely American , in the best sense of the word . Mr. Robert Herrick 's A Life for a Life 2 is a book of large scope , and of serious interest . ' American in subject-matter and in setting , it seems , at first glance , to contain much of our early line and stern idealism . It is an arraignment of present social conditions in our country , and , through the shifting scenes of which Hugh Grant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaknesses are exposed : the luxury of the rich , the misery of the poor , the questionable rights of property , the corruption of our banks , the manysided oppression of working women , with emphasis on the way in which they are mutilated by machinery and driven on the streets , the dishonesty of promoters , the venality of our courts and of our national government , the consciencelessness of universities , our passion for intellectual fads , discord between parents and children , between husbands and wives , the selfishness and lack of honor of both parties in the labor controversy , the wrongs of our tariff , the petty pilfering in our trade . The accusations are true , and we who live in a country which has promised a fairer hope to humankind can not hear too often , ' lest we forget , ' a recital of the countless ways in which we have failed ; but here too many points are attacked at once . The real general concentrates his forces ; this is a kind of guerrilla warfare all up and down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a South African mission school who chose as a subject of an essay , ' History , Geography , and the Earth , ' and began by saying , ' His-t ory , Geography , and the Earth just do go together . ' So they do , but one is occasionally singled out for special often-t ion . There is in A Life for a Life a Victor Hugo scope without a Victor Hugo grip . So many and so various are the themes discussed that all is blurred and confused , and one wonders that a book so apparently noble in motive can be so singularly ineffective in result . Possibly this comes , in part , from a lack of the balance and sanity of judgment that one finds in the great masters of fiction . Mr. Herrick has enumerated , in a series of episodes , nearly all our sins , but , inasmuch as he is endeavoring to put in the whole , he ought , in fairness , to admit that there is another side . As one reads , one can not help feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grain of faith . That fire of the spirit which thrills Victor Hugo when he presents human wrongs , that insistence on the soul , is not here . There is not enough resistance in the book ; the novelist , like his hero , Hugh Grant , goes down too easily before the wrongs he faces , and Hugh Grant sinks like a discomfited marionette before the swords of tin arrayed against him . He is no fighter , and can tell us nothing of the battle . Not thus did our ancestors wrestle with Satan ; they faced their warfare as those who meant to win . What if , after all , even in machine-ridden America , life be just a stuff To try the soul 's strength on , educe the man Nowhere in this hook is there any dramatic presentation of the age-long struggle wherein the Spirit is at strife , for the acting forces are all on one side .

If Mr. Herrick can see this truth , if he can write The Master of the Inn , one can but wish for him the power to work out this finer vision in his dramatic presentation of human life . There is , in truth , in his fiction more analytic than dramatic power , and he is more often the academic man searching for themes about which to write problem-novels than the man possessed by insight , conviction , emotion which he must voice . His work covers a large range of subjects , is extensive rather than intensive ; and his novels , like the themes in this special book , succeed one another too rapidly . This one is half treatise , half story , wavering between nothingness and creation , in the limbo of uncreate art . Mr. Herrick tells much abstract truth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth he does not tell in this book , wherein the somewhat vague characterization , the indefinite detail , fail to convince us of the reality of that concerning which he writes . Oddly enough , this work of a professor of English betrays a most careless prose . Even if it stops short of being ungrammatical , it is often slipshod . His ubiquitous short sentence fails of the Hugo effect perhaps intended , and the constant use of the dash , with swift breaking of the thought , is most annoying . The disintegrated sentence becomes an all-too-fitting symbol of disintegrated thought and purpose . Nathan Burke ' takes us hack to days when machinery counted less in our lives than it does at present ; when , possibly , the individual counted for more . It is refreshing to find a book which so contradicts the present trend of fiction , wherein most of our story-writers , adopting the pace set by the second-rate magazines , are eliminating every shade of meaning and of character-interpretation which do not hear on the next accident , and are producing work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is an air of Olympic , or of Early Victorian , leisure about Nathan Burke , an old-fashioned tale which , in the manner of an elder day , follows the hero from boyhood , through all phases of his develo'pment , into ripened manhood . It deals with the growth of an Ohio lad during the years preceding the Mexican War , and portrays country life , and life in a small town , with close and excellent local color . The book has at the core a fine Americanism , far removed front the cheap vulgarities of Blaze Derringer , ' and the superficial smartness of The Fortune Hunter , ' and it makes one realize , with all the Spartan plainness of country life , its heroic and silent idealism . This is the kind of interpretation of American life that we most need , not that which shouts our sins through the market-place , but that which erects above the market-place , for all men to see , the figure of one full of fine practicality , of humor , of humanness , yet incorruptible enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book will take its place among those pieces of fiction which , through masterly interpretat ion of an individual , have become the interpretation of the inner heart of a race . One takes it up and lays it down with a fresh sense of patriotism , remembering that this country which has produced corrupt politicians and conscienceless financiers has produced also Lincoln , and an unnamed host of those who share his humor and his integrity . At first glance it would seem as if the author had chosen an unfortunate moment to depict . It would take genius to make the Mexican War interesting , yet that is what Miss Watts has done , and Nathan 's experiences here are as absorbing as are his earlier ones as chore-boy , grocer 's clerk , lawyer .

There is , too , about this novel , a masculine breadth of sympathy and an underlying sweetness in interpreting human nature which go far in giving the tale the indefinable quality that endures .

The influence shows most clearly in the miner characters : Jim is an Americanized Warrington ; Mary Sharpless is Thackeray 's sylph type ; Francie is a yeunger sister of Amelia . Certain scenes are too nearly like some of those created by the great Englishman , notably those about Jim 's sick-bed , recalling in matter and in manner the illness of Pendennis , with his mother and Laura at his side ; while whole paragraphs of reflection sound like Thackeray 's very own .

Even with the admission that the author has not yet quite found her own manner , Nathan Burke must be pronounced the best novel in the pile of fiction of the last half-year . Setting aside fc ' - the moment the deeper aspects of the story , the sweetness and the sanity of its interpretation of life , and coming back to the humbler task with which we started out , we realize that Miss Watts 's gift for close and realistic work is remarkable . Detail is quietly given , not with the air of the writer of treatises , alert for fact wherewith to prove abstract statements , nor with the self-conscious manner of the professional novelist , industriously searching for touches wherewith to embellish certain points in the story , but with an exceeding naturalness , as of life itself . Here is a gift which can not be taught ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One can not at this moment ask , for American fiction , anything better than that Miss Watts will go on interpreting other individuals and other periods , and , in the deeper , inner sense , as in that relating to outer fact , ' lying like truth .
