txt Declaring himself in agreement with President Wilson 's statement of war aims , Premier Lloyd George , in a speech before Grey 's Inn benchers tonight , asserted that the Allies were making steady progress toward the goal of victory , which was the oily hope of peace . Any peace overtures to Prussia at this time , he added , would be a betrayal of trust . Victory was now a question of tonnage , he went on , and Germany was evidently gambling on a failure by the United States to transport her army to Europe . In the course of his speech the Premier pronounced the last word in the phase of the peace discussion started by the Marquis of Lansdowne 's recent letter . In his statement the Premier , whose utterance on this question had been awaited with great expectation , indorsed President Wilson 's declarations of war aims , but found no common ground in the paths of the President ' and the Marquis of Lansdowne toward peace . The Premier was silent as regards a new and specific statement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which pacifists have made demands . In reterence to tae recent letter of . the Marquis of Lansdowne , the Premier I Said : " I now understand that all our anxieties concerning this epistle were groundless , that the ? Marquis of Lansdowne did net intend , to convey the meaning which his words might reasonably bear , and that all the time he was in complete agreement with President Wilson 's message . Now , the Government is in full agreement with that message . Mr. Asquith also is in agreement with it . " I , therefore , take it that the interpretation , placed on the Marquis of Lansdowne 's letter here , in America and in France , both by supporters and op= ponents. , of the allied cause , and also in Austria and Germany , was not in the least the interpretation the Marquis of Lansdowne desired to give . " I do not desire to force a controversy if none exists , but I might be forgiven for repeating President Wilson - and in saying that it was a great misfortune that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Premier said that he did not fear the extreme pacifists , but added that there was an active minority of people busying themselves with the view that the letter was supposed to advocate , and who thought that they had discovered a leader in the action of forcing the country into a premature and a vanquished peace . " I warn the nation , " said the Premier , " to watch men who thin% there is a half-way house between victory and defeat . There is no such half-way house . These are the men who think the war can be ended now by some sort of peace  --  the setting up of a League of Nations . with conditions as to arbitration for disputesand provisions for disarmament , and with a covenant cn the part of all nations to sign , a treaty along these lines . No Pelee to Mere Words . " That is the right policy after victory . Without victory it would be a farce . " Who would sign such a treaty ? I presume . among others , the people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforce the new treaty ? I presume the nations that have so far not quite succeeded in enforcing the last . " To end the war entered upon and to enforce a treaty without reparation for infringement of that treaty merely by entering into a more sweeping treaty would , indeed , he a farce in the setting of a tragedy . " We are not misled by mere words like disarmament , arbitration , and similar terms . You can not wage war or secure peace by mere words . We ought never to have started unless'we meant , at all hazards , to complete our task " Of course our enemies are ready to accept a peace , leaving them with some of the richest provinces and the fairest cities of Russia in their pockets . " It is idle to talk of security under such conditions . There is no protection for life or property in a State where the criminal is more powerful than the law . The law of nations is no exception . We are dealing with a. criminal State now and there will always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too precarious to make fa profitable , and the punishment of international crime becomes too sure to make it attractve . " We are confronted with ; he alternatives of abasing ourselves in terror before the lawlessness , which means ulti4 , aately a world intimidated by success ! ? it bandits , or going through with our tink to establish a righteous and lasting peace for ourselves and our children . falsely no nation with any regard for its self-respect and any honor can hesitate a moment in its choice . Convinced of Progress to Goal . " If there were no prospects of things going better the longer we fought , it would be infamous to prolong the war , but because I am fully convinced , despite some untoward events and discouraging appearances .. that me are making steady progress toward the desired goal , I would regard peace overtures ? to Prussia , at the very moment when the Prussian military spirit is drunk with boastfulness , as a betrayal of the great trust with which my colleagues and I have been charged . " The German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubles 1 Idid not appear in the bulletins . However , we know something of them . The i deadly grip of the British Navy is having its effect and the valor of the troops is making an impression which will tell in the end . " Persons who in the last fortnight have been organizing a nervous breakdown in the nation are the same ones who recently were organizing a hysI terical shouting over the Flanders victories . " We are laying the foundation of the bridge ttiat will carry us into a new world . Let us maintain steadiness and sanity of outlook . " This is not the most propitious hour . Russia 's threatened ' retirement from the war strengthens the Hohenzollerns and weakens the forces of de ' mocracy , but Russia 's action will not lead , as she imagines , to universal peace . It will simply prolong the world 's agony atid inevitably put her in bondage to Prussian military dominance . If Russia persisted in her present policy , the Premier pointed out , the withdrawal t , T the enemy from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of thousands of men and I masses of material to attack Great Britain , France , and Italy . He went on : " It would be folly to underestimate the danger from the release of the enemy 's eastern forces . It would equally be folly to exaggerate it . But the greatest folly of all would be not to face it . America Coming 1 , with Both Arms , " " If the Russian democracy has deckled to abandon the struggle against military autocracy , the American democracy is taking it up . This is the most momentous fact of the year , h ? has transposed the whole situation . There is no more powerful country in the world than the United States , with their gigantic resources and indomitable people , and if Russia is out , America is coming in with beth arms . " If this is the worst moment , it is because Russia has stepped out and America is only preparing to come in . Her army is not yet ready and her tonnage is unbuilt , but with every hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be filled by the valiant sons of the great American Republic . " Germany knows it and Austria knows it . Hence the desperate efforts , to force the issue before America is I ready . They will not succeed , but we must I be prepared for greater efforts and greater sacrifices . It is no time to cower or to falter . " Great Britain 's will is as tempered steel and will bear all right to the end . There must be a further drain upon our man ' power in order to sustain the additional burden until the American Army arrives . " There is no ground for panic . Even now , after we have sent troops to Italy , the Allies have marked superiority in I numbers in France and Flanders and ' considerable reserves at home . ' ? " Much greater progress has been made in man power in the last few months than either our friends or our foes realize , but it is not enough to without **31;1366;TOOLONG power , however , does not end with the army . I Victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question of tonnage . Nothing can defeat us but the shortage of tonnage , and the advent of the United States has increased the tonnage problem enormously . Germany has gambled on Amreica 's failure to transport her army to Europe . " The Prussian claim is that alltocracy alone can do things . The honor of democracy is at stake , and I do not doubt that the Prussians will be disillusioned , but both America and Great Britain will have to strain their . resources to the utmost to increase their tonnage . The fact that American tonnage will be absorbed in the transport of their own armies compels us to increase our responsibilities in assisting France and Italy with the transportation of essential commodities to their shores . " In order to obtain the necessary men for this object we must interfere to even a greater extent than heretofore with the industries not absolutely essential to the prosecution of the war . " Premier Lloyd George , in concluding , emphasized how the country could aid by further economizing and in the increase of home production . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . British food import. ; next year , he stated in this connection , must be reduced 3,000,000 tons by increased home production and economy . The Premier also spoke on aerial warfare , saying that the nations possibly would determine that this must be the last war in which air weapons were used , as they brought the perils and horrors of the battlefields to civilians at homo who previously had dwelt in security .
