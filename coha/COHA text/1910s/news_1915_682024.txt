txt Extraordinary scenes prevailed at a meeting held in the Cannon Street Hotel this afternoon to support a policy of reprisals for the Zeppelin raids . The central hall was Packed by city men and there was a , sprinkling of women . At one period a cry of " Germans " was raised and Gsomething like a free fight ensued for several minutes , sticks and fists being used in the ejection of some persons . Lord Willoughby de Broke said they were not there to squeal or whine or call Germans names , but to urge the Government to stop the kind of thing that happened Wednesday night . " The Zeppelins , terrible as they are , " he said , " may do some good if they are to bring home to the people of this country that . we are at war and not at law . We want to know if the coalition Government is doing anything to stop these raids . " A voice : " What about Haldane ? " The remark produced . a momentary uproar , some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hanged . " We do not want to mention- any names , but I ' believe I quite agree with you , " exclaimed the speaker . He then demanded that the Government should have a definite air service and that the public should be told the truth . We do not want to do anything against the traditions of English chiv , airy , " he said , " but this is a national war and we must treat the Germans as they treat us or else we shall become the laughing stock of the world . " A voice : " We are now , Willoughby ! " " No , not yet , " the speaker replied . He then proceeded to say that the Government hall in the past turned a deaf ear to tht inventions of science , and there should be a special department at once instituted to deal with air service of the country . Demand Reprisals . o Mr. Soynson-Hicks , M. P. , said : " I propose that this mass meeting of city men state its definite belisf that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raids upon London and other English towns consists in the formal announcement on the part of this country of a systematic policy of reprisal raids by British and French aeroplanes upon towns in Germany , and this meeting hereby calls upon His Majesty 's Government to render protection to the lives and property of British subjects through4the issuance and prompt fulfillment of such a declaration. ? ' He said there was grave dissatisfaction with the attitude of the Government . Again and again , he said , he had urged the necessity of an aerial fleet , and though they were living under a calition Cabinet every member of Parliament had a right and duty to criticise if he believed they were not right . " I have in my possession , " he said , " a letter written two years ago by persons now occupying prominent positions in the air service , in which . they asked for the service to have Zeppelins. - stianitatcs know whether the Government-when they decided to go without Zeppelins or large airships , consulted inert who alone know . We know that 127 English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and every man and woman in that total cries out for vengeance today . Where is the swarm of hornets Winston Churchill promised us would be waiting for any hostile airships ? Do n't we pay taxes ? Do n't we pay salaries to our Ministers ? Do n't we give them peerages and privy councilorships ? I think we have a right to demand as an essence of our citizenship that the country should be protected . " Loud cheers followed this . After a year of war , he said , the Admiralty had appointed a director of London 's air defenses . " We do not want single machines , " he said , " but squadrons 200 strong . Machine following machine with bombs circling round and round over Coblentz and Cologne in order to make the Germans realize the destruction of their raids here . " He called attention to what was being done in France , where , he said , they were building huge battleplanes to which latest machines flying at ? eighty miles an hour would be as children to giants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but at certain points where he criticised the Government there were remarks from protesters . The resolution was seconded by Ernest Jardine , M. P. , who also spoke strongly about the present Government and told the audience to go home and pray . for their country was In peril . " Pray , " he said , " for a leader who will lead you to victory . " When the resolution was put it carried almost unanimously , but some one in the audience made a remark that was taken to be " no , " with the instant result that he was pounced upon as a German . As the identity of . the protester was doubtful at first a sort of ring was drawn round the area from which his voice came and eventually one or two men were forcibly dragged oat . They put up such a stout resistance that the police had to interfere and eventually amid cries of " German tractor " and much hissing , the man was pummeled out of the room . Walking sticks played an active part in the incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolutions urging the necessity of a speedy formation of a Ministry of Air to take complete and independent charge of the naval and military forces of the country . Sir George seconded the resolution . Ho said there were naturalized Germans in this country who claimed that within twenty-four hours of air raids they were in full possession of the damage done and had sent it to America . Lord Headley also asked for reprisals , and amid cheers and i , aughter asked : " If a burglar comes and hits me In the eye with a brick shall I coax him down with My wife 's ostrich feather ? " A London clergyman , the Rev. A. W. Gough , supported the movement for re ' prisais . He said the meeting had been called for a Christian purpose , " so let Ins have done with silly and soft pre ' sentments of Christianity as if it meant something that has no Quality of mighthood , nor any part of sacrifice , nor any righteous courage to severely punish wrongs . " Both resolutions carried .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
