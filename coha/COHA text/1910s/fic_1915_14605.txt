ACOZY bedroom in a little cottage is disclosed . It is quaintly furnished . An old wooden bed is at the left projecting from the wall : directly against the opposite wall is a small dressing-table with a dainty flowered covering . Above this hangs a mirror reflecting the two candles now lighted , which are resting amidst the toilet articles . Beyond this there is a broad window through which the moonlight is now streaming . In back a doorway opens into another room . At the foot of the bed is a steamer-trunk full of clothes , with its lid open . On the other side of the bed in back is a large wardrobe . There are some chairs , a what-not , and several old-fashioned pictures on the quietly papered walls ; but the room is otherwise scantily furnished . It has , however , the air of unpretentious comfort . CONSTANCE is alone . She is about twenty-two , with abundant beauty and an entrancing charm . She is full of vitality , flexible in mood , with , the occasional authority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its mingling of unconscious selfishness and spasmodic consideration . She has just put on her kimono over her night-gown . As she hums happily she takes down her hair . She stops , after a moment , puts her bare feet into her pretty tuffed slippers , goes to the trunk , lifts the tray and takes out a daintily framed photograph . Looking at it half dreamily she slowly crosses to the dressing-table , placing it between the two candles , whose light reveals the photograph of a young man . She kisses it but turns its face down quickly so it ca n't be seen as she hears the door in back open . SARAH , her sister , enters . SARAH is ten years older : very plain so far as externals go ; rather a quiet personality , in fact , though colored subtly by her humor and generous sympathies . Her hair is down in long braids and she , too , wears her kimono and bedroom slippers . Throughout there is a sense of deep personal intimacy brooding over the two as they talk with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next room . SARAH GREENWELL ( Softly closing the door ) Mother 's asleep now . p. 3 CONSTANCE I thought you were never coming . SARAH GREENWELL It 's been such an exciting day for her : having you come home and all . ( Going to her . ) You must be tired , too . CONSTANCE ( Feeling the back of her head ) I am . I 'm all in a knot back here . SARAH GREENWELL Let me rub it CONSTANCE ( As SARAH rubs her neck ) Um ! I could purr like a pussy cat . What wonderful fingers you have , sister ! SARAH GREENWELL I do this to mother every time she has one of her bad headaches . She 's grown to depend on it . CONSTANCE Dear little mother . SARAH GREENWELL ( Slipping her arms close down and kissing her ) Dear little sister . CONSTANCE I 've looked forward so to this hour alone with you . SARAH GREENWELL We have n't had many these last four years , have we ? CONSTANCE No . ( As SARAH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so relaxing . p. 4 SARAH GREENWELL Let me look at you , dear . CONSTANCE ( Playfully taking hold of Sarah 's braids ) Would n't it be lovely if we could always wear our hair down like this SARAH GREENWELL Why ? CONSTANCE We both look so much prettier . SARAH GREENWELL I did n't know I could be improved upon . CONSTANCE Oh , yes , you can . ( They both laugh . ) I mean  --   --  SARAH GREENWELL All the good looks went to you , did n't they ? ( CONSTANCE smiles . ) Mother says John would have been a handsome man if he 'd lived . CONSTANCE I should like to have had a real brother . SARAH GREENWELL Instead of so many volunteers ? CONSTANCE Well , I could n't help it if the boys liked me . SARAH GREENWELL Of course not . You are all unpacked ? ( SARAH goes to trunk and unpacks it during this , hanging the things at intervals in the wardrobe . CONSTANCE combs and braids her hair . ) CONSTANCE Now , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GREENWELL But your pretty dresses will all get wrinkled . CONSTANCE ( Playfully ) You are beginning to take charge of me again . SARAH GREENWELL You see I have n't changed since you last saw me . CONSTANCE A year ca n't change a fellow much . SARAH GREENWELL It 's made you more beautiful , Con . CONSTANCE ( Glancing covertly toward the photograph ) That 's because  --   --  SARAH GREENWELL Because you 're a woman now . My little sister 's a woman ! CONSTANCE ( Thoughtfully ) Yes ; in some ways only  --  only  --  I have n't entirely said good-by to the little sister . ( Impulsively ) Is everything the same here ? SARAH GREENWELL Just the same . ( Holding up a skirt . ) Goodness , that needs a new braid . ( CONSTANCE pays no attention to the clothes as she ties small pink ribbons to her braids , looking now and then in the mirror . ) CONSTANCE Mother 's well , is n't she ? p. 6 SARAH GREENWELL Yes ; she sleeps so much better , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GREENWELL Oh , the days pass somehow . CONSTANCE Does she still keep up her church work ? SARAH GREENWELL That 's the only social life we have here . CONSTANCE Any other excitement in the village ? SARAH GREENWELL We 've got a new minister . CONSTANCE Good looking ? SARAH GREENWELL Yes , but fifty . CONSTANCE Interesting ? SARAH GREENWELL Mother likes him . CONSTANCE ( Turning abruptly to SARAH ) Sister , you 've had awful tough luck with men . SARAH GREENWELL ( Laughing and taking it good-naturedly throughout ) Absent treatment , you mean ? CONSTANCE Do n't you find it terribly unsatisfactory ? ( SARAH waves it aside , but CONSTANCE persists with a certain hidden curiosity . ) Sarah , have n't you ever thought of getting married ? p. 7 SARAH GREENWELL I 've got imagination , Con , and lots of time to think . CONSTANCE Well , why do n't you get married ? SARAH GREENWELL ( Casually ) For the simplest reason in the world : nobody has asked me . CONSTANCE Have you encouraged them ? SARAH GREENWELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Con . CONSTANCE Have n't you ever been in love , either ? SARAH GREENWELL No . CONSTANCE ( Amazed ) And you do n't seem a bit sorry ? SARAH GREENWELL I hate people who pity themselves . Maybe I 'm not the marrying sort . CONSTANCE You 'd make the best wife in the world . You love to take care of people . SARAH GREENWELL ( Smiling ) Is that all a wife 's for ? CONSTANCE ( Wisely ) Lots of men seem to think so . ( With a sigh ) Maybe you 're too good to be married . p. 8 SARAH GREENWELL ( Coming to her and tweaking her good-naturedly ) Maybe the reason I 've had no chance to marry is because I have such an attractive little sister . CONSTANCE ( Mischievously ) Did you send me away to college to avoid the competition ? SARAH GREENWELL I did n't succeed very well , did I ? CONSTANCE ( Seriously ) Sarah , do n't you ever get tired of it here ? Do n't you ever feel like some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a new minister . CONSTANCE Oh , be serious , sister . You 're in outrageously good spirits to-night . You 're jesting about the most sacred matters . ( With enthusiasm ) Do n't you ever want something thrilling to happen , something that gives you a prickly sensation right down to the toes ? SARAH GREENWELL That 's why I am so happy to-night . ( After a moment 's instinctive hesitation , as CONSTANCE leans forward , waiting eagerly , SARAH steps towards her mother 's door , listens , and then comes close to her sister . ) What would you say if I told you I am going to have an adventure ? p. 9 CONSTANCE Who is he ? SARAH GREENWELL It is n't a man : it 's a trip . CONSTANCE A trip ? Go on , I 'm crazy to know . ( Shaking her . ) Go on  --  go on . SARAH GREENWELL I 've made all the preparations . I 've told no one . I 've only been waiting for you to come back home so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately drops all her banter and gives SARAH a frightened , questioning look . ) Oh , it is n't so dreadful , Con ; do n't be frightened . CONSTANCE ( Slowly ) How could anybody take your place with mother ? SARAH GREENWELL You could and only you . ( Smiling . ) It will be a change for mother to talk to a college graduate . CONSTANCE ( Dubiously ) Mother 's a dear , but it does n't need a college education to talk to her . SARAH GREENWELL ( Laughing ) Yet think of all the new subjects she can discuss while I 'm away . CONSTANCE ( Hardly grasping it ) You 're really going away ? p. 10 SARAH GREENWELL Yes . Does it surprise you so ? CONSTANCE Sort of . SARAH GREENWELL ( With nave enthusiasm throughout ) It did me , too . But you get used to a surprise when you think and plan over it for a year . CONSTANCE ( As she fingers the photograph in thought ) Sarah , I ca n't seem to think of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the landscape , eh ? CONSTANCE Yes . The reliable oak mother 's clinging to . SARAH GREENWELL I felt kind of timid myself at first . CONSTANCE ( Looking at her ) Why , you 're blushing now , Sarah . You 're all excited . SARAH GREENWELL It thrills me down to the toes as you said . CONSTANCE What are you going to do ? SARAH GREENWELL ( With delight ) I 'm going to New York to study nursing ! CONSTANCE ( Disappointed ) You call that an adventure ? SARAH GREENWELL ( Happily ) It seems like it to me. p. 11 CONSTANCE But could n't you learn nursing here ? SARAH GREENWELL I 've read all the books I could get , but the only place to really learn is in a hospital . CONSTANCE Ugh ! I hate the thought of it . SARAH GREENWELL ( With suppressed excitement . ) It 's the one thing I think I can do ; so when I made up my mind I made inquiries . My ! how I trembled over that first letter ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me at first , as I did n't want to touch our little income . But to-day  --  on the same train that you came  --  there was a letter from the Nurses ' Settlement in New York . They told me there 's a place open where I can study and , by taking charge of some children in the district , I can pay my own way . ( Glowing ) Think of that ! CONSTANCE ( With a hidden thought ) When are you going ? SARAH GREENWELL They 'll hold it open two weeks . I 'm going to write them to-night that I 'll be there the fourteenth . That will be giving you and me a chance for a visit together first . CONSTANCE ( Eyeing her closely ) Sarah , have you told me the real reason you want to go ? p. 12 SARAH GREENWELL ( Frankly ) Why , yes , dear . CONSTANCE There 's no man you want to get away from ? SARAH GREENWELL ( Laughing ) Nonsense ; you 've got men on the brain . Men do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! This is my romance  --  just like religion is to mother . It 's my adventure  --  my  --  I was going to say  --  my flight . CONSTANCE ( Slowly ) You 're doing it because you think every woman ought to have a job ? SARAH GREENWELL ( Taking her hands and speaking with great simplicity ) No , no ; nothing like that . It 's a personal feeling . I suppose what I need is a change  --  something complete for a while . I 'm in a groove , Con , and I 've been going along in it for years . Most of the women here are living in grooves , too ; only they do n't know it . Mother is : she 's so comfortable in hers ; she simply could n't stand having a change ; it would upset her beyond words . Lots of them are like mother . It 's so easy to slip along year after year in your own particular groove . It has its ups and downs , of course ; but it 's there just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all ready for us ; our fathers and mothers crease them out and we follow right along . Some of us make them ourselves  --  maybe I have : like the animals in the ground that have their little runways over which they go day after day . After a while you think of it as part of your life : something you do mechanically because you 've always done it . ( Sweetly ) Well , I thought I 'd like to get out of my comfortable little groove to see what it would be like . So I made up my mind I 'd try it for a year at least . p. 13 CONSTANCE ( Startled ) A year ! SARAH GREENWELL Yes ; maybe I wo n't last that long . Some of those who 've left come back : the groove is so much easier . But in a year , with what I know now , I 'll be a well-qualified nurse and  --  ( Tenderly )  --  maybe perhaps you 'll want to be getting married by then and go away  --  ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Con , I do want you to be married some day . What is it , dear ? Are n't you glad I told you about my going ? CONSTANCE ( Restrained ) Have you told mother ? SARAH GREENWELL Not yet . CONSTANCE Why ? SARAH GREENWELL I thought it would be easier for mother when she had you already here with her . CONSTANCE One of us must stay ? SARAH GREENWELL ( Simply ) Of course . We 're all she has . ( CONSTANCE eyes the photograph again , while SARAH looks toward her mother 's door as though listening to hear a sound . There is a pause . ) CONSTANCE ( Quietly ) I 'm so glad you told me , sister . You ought to have it . I do n't see how you 've stood it all these years . p. 14 SARAH GREENWELL I have not been unhappy : only I need a change . CONSTANCE Is that all you call it ? SARAH GREENWELL I said it was my romance . But I 've waited a long while . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Con ? Say it , dear . CONSTANCE ( Softly ) Mine has come quicker . SARAH GREENWELL Your what ? CONSTANCE My  --  my romance . SARAH GREENWELL You 've always had romance . You 're beautiful . CONSTANCE I mean the real one . SARAH GREENWELL ( Beginning to understand ) The real one ? CONSTANCE Yes . ( She hesitates and then slowly gives the photograph to SARAH , who gazes at it quietly . ) SARAH GREENWELL In love ? ( CONSTANCE nods quickly . ) Oh , I 've been talking about myself and not about you . And you had this to show me . CONSTANCE ( In spite of herself ) Do you like him ? p. 15 SARAH GREENWELL Yes . But I suppose it flatters him . CONSTANCE ( Emphatically ) Not a bit . SARAH GREENWELL Is he tall ? CONSTANCE Over six feet . SARAH GREENWELL You always liked tall boys . CONSTANCE When I could get them . There 's so much more to love . SARAH GREENWELL And they all were fond of you . CONSTANCE ( In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Not the way Paul is . SARAH GREENWELL Paul ? CONSTANCE ( Glowing ) Paul Lamar . Is n't it a lovely name ? He is the most wonderful man I 've ever met ! He 's strong and brilliant and  --   --  SARAH GREENWELL Yes , yes . CONSTANCE He 's a civil engineer , like his father . I 've known him all winter and we 've seen each other every day . He asked me yesterday if  --  if I would marry him . SARAH GREENWELL Marry him ? ( There is a long silence . Then SARAH , more serious , lifts CONSTANCE 'S head and gazes into her eyes. ) p. 16 CONSTANCE I love him , sister , I love him SARAH GREENWELL ( Slowly ) I believe you do . CONSTANCE I could n't write about it till it happened for sure . SARAH GREENWELL ( simply ) It must be nice to be loved . CONSTANCE It is . SARAH GREENWELL But we must n't be sad about it . You 've been in love before . CONSTANCE ( Half peevishly ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was young . You said yourself I 'm a woman now . I 've never been in love before : honestly , sis , never really before . SARAH GREENWELL I 'm not blaming you . ( Still gazing at photograph . ) Only I want you to be sure of yourself . CONSTANCE I am sure this time  --  very sure . SARAH GREENWELL ( Cheerfully ) Then we must have him down for a visit . CONSTANCE You want to look him over ? SARAH GREENWELL ( Laughing ) Yes . Could he come now ? p. 17 CONSTANCE He said he 'd hang on the mail-box . SARAH GREENWELL We 'll wire him to-morrow . ( She gives back the photograph to CONSTANCE , who places it on the table . ) I certainly want him down before I go away . CONSTANCE ( Troubled ) Before you go ? SARAH GREENWELL My being here will help mother get used to him . And then he can come down every once in a while to visit you . When I come back you 'll know for sure if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperately ) I tell you I 'm sure now . SARAH GREENWELL You should give it time . CONSTANCE ( Involuntarily ) You do n't know what it is to wait . You 've never been in love . SARAH GREENWELL ( Simply ) I know what it is to wait . CONSTANCE Forgive me , Sarah . SARAH GREENWELL ( Taking her hands again affectionately ) I have n't had much experience , Con ; but I 'm your older sister . I 've sort of watched without taking part in what goes on . There 's love and hate and sorrow here in this little place just like everywhere else . That 's " the ups and downs " I spoke of . And people make mistakes . I want the best there is for you : a home , children and a full life . p. 18 CONSTANCE Is there any way of knowing beforehand except by what you feel ? SARAH GREENWELL Feelings are real but not always right . There 's no other way of knowing . And people always mean to make their marriage happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fixed up . ( Impressively ) But do n't forget , Con , you never can fix up a marriage that is n't just quite right . That was mother 's marriage , you know . CONSTANCE ( After a long , thoughtful pause ) A year 's a long while when you 're young . SARAH GREENWELL The years become longer as you grow older  --  less happens . ( Persuasively ) So do n't be impatient , little sister . Remember I want you to be happy that way above all else . So wait till I come back . CONSTANCE ( With difficulty ) Sarah , I have n't told you everything . His father has a government contract to build a huge viaduct in Brazil . He has offered Paul a chance with him out there . It 's a great opportunity . He 's so ambitious . SARAH GREENWELL He 's going ? CONSTANCE Yes . SARAH GREENWELL When does he go ? p. 19 CONSTANCE In two months . SARAH GREENWELL For how long ? CONSTANCE ( Slowly ) Three years . SARAH GREENWELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) And he has asked you to go with him ? CONSTANCE Yes . SARAH GREENWELL You told him you 'd go ? CONSTANCE I said I would write him after I saw you and mother . SARAH GREENWELL ( Very quietly ) You want to go ? CONSTANCE I love him . ( In the silence that follows SARAH sits motionless , though her eyes have flashed for a moment with instinctive rebellion which CONSTANCE detects . ) I did n't know about you and your plan to go away . SARAH GREENWELL ( Almost inaudibly ) The groove ! CONSTANCE ( Kneeling beside her and burying her head in SARAH 'S lap ) No , no , Sarah , I wo n't accept it  --  I wo n't . I 've always taken everything from you . I wo n't take this . I 'll stay-I 'll wait . ( SARAH looks at her and runs her hand lovingly over CONSTANCE 'S hair in obvious appreciation of this impulse. ) p. 20 SARAH GREENWELL Let me think a moment . CONSTANCE I know all it means . You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mother different ! SARAH GREENWELL We must accept people as they are . CONSTANCE If she only had a life of her own ; something to occupy it  --  some work ! She 's well  --  she 's able  --   --  SARAH GREENWELL She feels she 's done her duty having us . CONSTANCE ( Rebelliously ) If I ever have a child , I hope I wo n't feel it must sacrifice for me . SARAH GREENWELL Yes , you will : if you 're like mother  --  dependent , with nothing but her home and her children , since father died . CONSTANCE It is n't right . ( Quickly ) Ca n't you go anyway ? Have somebody come here in your place ? Write Cousin Sally or  --  oh , Sarah ; tell mother about it . She 'll understand . Tell her how you 've counted on it . Let me tell her ; let me remind her how you 've stayed here with her , year after year  --   --  SARAH GREENWELL Hush ! She 'll hear you . CONSTANCE I want her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Suppose she did n't understand ? Could we take that risk of hurting her ? ( CONSTANCE bows her head . ) It 's what she feels  --  that is all we have to go by . She 's often said she gave her youth to us . CONSTANCE ( Bitterly ) And you have given yours to her in return . SARAH GREENWELL I 've done it willingly . One is enough . Mine is nearly gone . ( With resolution ) You sha' n't give yours , Con . CONSTANCE But I wo n't accept it . SARAH GREENWELL ( Smiling ) Yes , you will . Youth does . CONSTANCE You did n't . SARAH GREENWELL No one else had a claim on me . Somebody loves you . CONSTANCE ( With less persistency ) But , sister , he 'll understand . SARAH GREENWELL Do n't you know me well enough to see that I could n't let my foolish little plan stand between you and him ? CONSTANCE I 'd blame myself every day  --  every hour . p. 22 SARAH GREENWELL What for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seek ? Something that makes life ? It is n't anybody 's fault ; unless it is mine in making you go away . CONSTANCE It would n't have happened if I 'd stayed here like other girls . Why did you make me go ? SARAH GREENWELL Because I noticed in our garden that the seeds which fell from a plant never grew up if they took root in the shade of its own leaves . That 's why the wind scatters them out into free soil . CONSTANCE ( Slowly ) Yet see what has happened . SARAH GREENWELL ( Patting her hand ) But it has happened . So let 's look it in the face . CONSTANCE It seems all twisted and wrong . SARAH GREENWELL I made one mistake , Con ; it only just dawned on me . I forgot you could never be contented here when you finally did come back . It must be a small place here after you 've had a glimpse of the world . CONSTANCE Oh , Sarah , it is a small place . SARAH GREENWELL ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 CONSTANCE I love you , too , sister ; very , very much . SARAH GREENWELL But you do n't need me to make you happy . ( CONSTANCE protests . ) No ; you do n't . Yet I can always keep in your heart far away in the corner where you can come to me if ever you need me . And you will come if  --  ? ( CONSTANCE kisses her hand in acquiescence . ) So you must go with him , if you are sure . CONSTANCE But I hate to think of you slipping back into the groove ? SARAH GREENWELL ( Cheerfully ) See here , little sister . I do n't want you to spoil any of your own joy thinking of me like that . People can make choices ; they can go or they can stay if they wish ; and when they make their choice they should n't rebel at what they have n't taken . Now I feel I must stay here with mother . I 've had my foolish dream and  --  and sometime far off  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must stay here now . CONSTANCE Oh , Sarah ! SARAH GREENWELL There 's no arguing that in my heart . You see , I 'm not pitying myself or being sorry , Con . For a moment , it did seem to put out the light . But I 've been looking at it too steadily and it hid the other objects . So promise me you 'll be happy about me. p. 24 CONSTANCE Ca n't I do anything ? SARAH GREENWELL ( With the intensity of profound conviction ) Yes . Do n't you ever let your life slip into a groove ! ( CONSTANCE sits deeply impressed by the thought . After a long pause SARAH rises and goes to the dressing-table . ) I forgot to fill your lamp . ( She sees the photograph , picks it up , looks at it wonderingly , and then puts it down silently . Then she blows out one of the candles , crosses and pulls down the bed-covers which are flooded by the soft moonlight . ) You must go to bed . You 're tired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see you in bed before I go . CONSTANCE Wo n't you tuck up with me like we used to ? SARAH GREENWELL We 'd talk ; and you must get your rest . Come . CONSTANCE ( Rising and going to SARAH ) Oh , sister ! SARAH GREENWELL ( Impulsively throwing her arms about her and then holding her at arms ' length while speaking earnestly ) We women must learn to see clearly . All the women I know mix their feelings with the facts . p. 25 CONSTANCE You 're the finest sister in the world . SARAH GREENWELL Nonsense , dear ; I 'm the only one you have . ( She slips off CONSTANCE 'S wrapper . ) Come ! CONSTANCE ( As she slowly gets into the bed ) But I 'm not sleepy . SARAH GREENWELL ( As she pulls up the covers ) Does the moonlight bather you ? CONSTANCE No . SARAH GREENWELL I 've left a blanket here . It gets chilly toward morning . Good-night , little woman . CONSTANCE Good-night . ( SARAH leans over and kisses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times as though quieting her . She lingers a moment and then moves slowly to the table . As she lifts the lighted candle she catches a glimpse of her own tired face in the mirror . She is startled for a moment , then turns slowly away , carrying the candle toward the door . ) Sarah ? SARAH GREENWELL Yes ? CONSTANCE Do you think there are any grooves in Brazil ? ( SARAH smiles wisely and goes out into their mother 's room , closing the door quietly. )
