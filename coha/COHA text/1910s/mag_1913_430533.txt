DICK WHITTINGTON , the young Gloucestershire boy ( as we learned in our childhood days ) , weary of London and seeing nothing but failure in the cruel city where things had gone so hard with him , made up his mind to cut away and leave it all behind ; but was stopped at Highgate Hill by the peal of Bow Bells , which rang out a cheery message , " Turn again , Whittington , Lord Mayor of London ! " This was in 1368 , when Whittington was but ten years of age . The year 1397 found him Lord Mayor . There was no Mansion House for him then : the present home of the Lord Mayor was built about 170 years ago . If Whittington , as Lord Mayor , could now stand on the steps of the Mansion House , he would find himself in the very center of that little square mile of the great metropolis now called the City , looking at the Royal Exchange , the great Bank of England , and feeling the throbbing heart of London , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small central part of modern London . He would be told that the City had now hardly 20,000 inhabitants , while the greater London , covering 700 square miles about him , had a population of nearly seven and a half millions . From the steps of the Exchange he could see the Lord Mayor 's home to advantage , ? a handsome structure , finely built . And there is Cheapside and the great church tower designed by Sir  | Christopher Wren . There . : : r the Bow Bells . Anyone born within the sound of these bells , they say , is a true cockney . THE TOWER OF LONDON Setting out from there , Whittington would , no doubt . today select what most visitors do as the first place t. visit , the famous Tower of London . I never could understand why it is called " The Tower " ; but it is historically the most interesting place in all England . The great scattering tower in the center is called " The White . " This takes you back at once to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great building have altered very much since William 's day . He began this great collection of buildings , and the White Tower was the earliest part : called so because it was once whitewashed . Inside this tower is a great collection of antique armor . Under the staircase were found the bones of the two poor young princes , Edward V. and his brother , Duke of York , sons of Edward IV. , who were murdered by their uncle , Richard III. , in 1483 . The Tower was the scene of many sad tragedies in English history . The list of notables beheaded there would fill pages . Prominent among them were poor Anne Boleyn , the unfortunate Catharine Howard , and Lady Jane Grey . Originally the Tower was a royal palace and state hall ; but it is known in history chiefly as a prison , and was the scene of some of the most terrible episodes in the history of England . Today it is a museum of extraordinary historic interest . It is , too , a treasure house : the crown jewels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known today , fifteen million dollars in value . The crown of Queen Victoria , made in 1838 , is there , a masterpiece containing 2,818  | diamonds , 300 pearls , and other gems . There , too , is a facsimile of the famous great diamond , the Koh-i-noor . The original is at Windsor Castle ; but the Koh-i-noor which reigned supreme for years now fills a second place beside the Cullinan diamond presented to Edward VII . in 1907 by the government of the Transvaal , which was split and is mounted in two parts in the Regalia . From the Tower the natural place to go is St. Paul 's . So , take a bus , climb the shaking steps , ? for the London bus seldom stops , and soon you will reach the largest church in England . On the way you will pass the Bank of England , an institution national in character , though not in establishment , to which I have referred as facing the Royal Exchange . This great institution was founded in 1694 by a Scotsman , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a director of the bank . It is not , as its name might lead one to suppose , a national bank ; but is a private institution , and the first of its kind in Great Britain . It is the only bank in England that has the power to issue paper money . It acts as agent ofwthe English government , and manages the national debt , for which it receives a special annual compensation . The capital was originally L1,200,000 ; but that has been multiplied to more than  | twelve times since the beginning . The building is low and long , covering a block of four acres . It has no windows ; but is lighted from interior courts ? this for security . The institution employs over one thousand people , and has all of its stationery and paper money printed within its walls . ST . PAUL 'S We have mentioned the name of Sir Christopher Wren , the great architect who in I7I0 completed the superb church of St. Paul 's , built on an eminence in the very heart of the City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; defrayed , it is said , by a tax on coal . Sir Christopher received , during the building of the structure , a salary of only $1,000 yearly . St. Paul 's resembles St. Peter 's in Rome ; but , of course , it is smaller . It is 500 feet long , 118 feet broad , and 364 feet to the top of the cross on the dome . Architects , almost without exception , admit this to be the finest dome in existence . It is 112 feet in diameter , which is 27 feet less than that of St. Peter 's . St. Paul 's and Westminster Abbey , the two greatest religious edifices in England , were rivals from early time , and out of this came the phrase , " Robbing Peter to pay Paul . " Westminster was known as St. Peter 's . In 1551 an appropriation was made there to clear up a deficiency in the accounts of St. Paul 's . The people exclaimed , " Why rob Peter to pay Paul ? " The question was revived on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1778 . The people of London wanted to bury the great statesman in St. Paul 's . Parliament said that if Pitt was not buried with the great in Westminster it would be " robbing Peter to pay Paul . " So the question was decided in favor of Westminster . The inscription on the great bell of St. Paul 's is " Richard Phelps made me , 1716 . " It is tolled only on the death of a sovereign , or a member of a royal family , and for a Lord Mayor of London who dies during his mayoralty.  | TRAFALGAR SQUARE After viewing the wonderful interior of the cathedral and the many tombs of England 's famous men , a walk up the Strand , the most famous street in the world , brings us to Trafalgar Square , from which radiate streets leading to every important part of the metropolis . One of the most spacious , open , and attractive spots in London is Trafalgar Square . It celebrates the Battle of Trafalgar , gained by the English over France and Spain , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the center of the square stands the graceful Nelson monument , glorifying the achievements of the hero of Trafalgar . On the north side is the National Gallery , a dignified building , containing many of the greatest art treasures of the world . It is at the Nelson Monument that great labor and political meetings are held , the open space about it affording standing room for many thousands . THE BRITISH MUSEUM The National Gallery leads , naturally , to mention of the British Museum , that most famous institution of its kind in the world . It grew out of the library and collection of Sir Hans Sloane , who disposed of it to the government for $100,000 , a sum estimated as far below its value .  | This great museum is the natural objective point of all visitors to London . It is a low building , 370 feet in length , with 44 Ionic columns . A lifetime of study could be spent there without exhausting an appreciable part of its riches . It is impossible to do more than touch on the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , note and remember the Grecian marbles taken from the Parthenon at Athens and placed in the museum by Lord Elgin . HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT But from Trafalgar Square the deep , solemn tones of Big Ben guide us down Whitehall past the proud Horse Guards to the true seat of the British Government . From the Thames Embankment the best view may be had of the notable buildings of Parliament . There , rising 318 feet high , is the tower with its great clock , 23 feet in diameter , and its bell , Big Ben , one of the largest in the world and weighing 13 tons . They say it takes five hours to wind up the clock . Below its sober face , in the great stretch of buildings , the British government is conducted . The Parliament buildings look their part . They are as beautiful and impressive outside as they are luxurious inside . The houses were erected in 1840 from plans selected out of 97 sent in competition . The style is rich Gothic , the buildings not high , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They contain II courts , too stairways , and 1 , too apartments . These are simple statements of fact , striking , it is true , but conveying , after all , no impression of the great beauty and what we might call the " human interest quality " of the Parliament buildings . One must go through the buildings again and again , must be 8 present at some of the meetings of Parliament , and then mingle with the people at the tea hour on , the terrace , to get a real impression of the meaning of the place . The buildings have settled , so that their base is lower than the level of the Thames . That gives an impression of solidity , of solid grip on the ground , to anyone viewing the buildings from the embankment on the other side of the Thames .  | WESTMINSTER ABBEY And there , across the square , stands the real center of interest to every visitor to London , England 's Hall of Fame . A writer of fertile imagination and eloquent phrase tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant and stood for . A friend said to him , " Rest your mind ; call it simply Westminster Abbey , ' and all the world will know what that name means . " In 616 a church was erected on the site of low ground on the north bank of the Thames . It was built by King Sebert in honor of Saint Peter . From time to time it was replaced , and now Westminster is a beautiful monument . wonderful in architecture , graceful but strong . In all its lovely lines beauty has , by the cunning of the chisel , been carved out of strength . THE TEMPLE OF FAME Westminster is called by the English the national temple of fame , ? " Valhalla " some name it , and burial there is reckoned to be the last and greatest honor that the nation can confer . Many volumes would be required to give even brief description of the interesting features of this wondrous abbey . A simple list of the distinguished dead buried there , and the memorial monuments and windows , makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a memorial , Westminster has architectural features of great beauty . The total length , including the chapel of Henry VII. , is 513 feet . The height is 1o2 feet , and the towers 225 feet . In Westminster Abbey is the chair made of oak for Edward I. , containing the " Stone of Scone " ( the emblem of Scottish power ) said to have once been used by the patriarch Jacob as a pillow . It is made of sandstone , and may have come from the Island of Iona as a relic of Saint Columba . Edward I. brought it to London in 1297 as a token of the subjection of Scotland , and every monarch since his time has been crowned in this chair . BUCKINGHAM PALACE Everyone wants to see the king 's home . Out at the west end of beautiful St. James 's Park stands Buckingham Palace , a fine , substantial structure , simple in lines , but dignified and impressive . The palace gets its name from John Sheffield , the Duke of Buckinghamshire , who in 1705 built a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was purchased in 1761 by George III. , who occasionally occupied it . Then it was remodeled by George IV . in 1825 . It became the real London residence of royalty when Queen Victoria occupied it in 1837.  | I have touched on only a few of the notable things to be seen in London . It is best for anyone who cares to study that marvelous city , rightly called " The World 's Metropolis , " to approach it with only one particular line of research in mind . Should he choose to follow the course of history and study the careers of monarchs and royal persons , the Tower and other notable public buildings will tell him their stories . If he seeks to know something of the life of the people , he will find it in spots like Piccadilly Circus , Charing Cross , the Strand , Cheapside , London Bridge , and the I Names Embankment , with occasional excursions through the suburbs . If he would like to know the literary landmarks of London , he has a rich field before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old Curiosity Shop and the other spots immortalized by Dickens , the Cheshire Cheese , the interesting old tavern haunted by memories of Goldsmith and Dr. Johnson , and other buildings and localities identified with some of the most famous writers of the world . If he would study the lives of the great and summon their spirits before him in one mighty immortal choir , let him go to Westminster Abbey and linger there awhile in the Hall of Fame .  |
