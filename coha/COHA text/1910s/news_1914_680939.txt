txt The Massachusetts Supreme Court has handed down a decision annulling the New Haven Railroad 's proposed $67,552,000 6% 20-year debenture bond issue . The court holds that the statute did not authorize the commission to approve an issue of bonds containing an option for exchange of stock at par during a ' period beginning five years after . - The $67,552,000 bond issue was designed principally to pay off $40,000,000 notes which matured December 1 last , and $5,000,000 debentures to mature February 1 , and for general improveMent purposes . After protracted hearings the new Massachusetts Public Utilities Commission approved the bond issue , one member filing a vigorous dissenting opinion . Morgan G. Bulkeley , president of the Aetna Insurance Co. , was the chief opponent of the bond issue before the commission , and carried the fight into the courts . When it became clear that a court decision could not be obtained before December 1 , the New Haven Railroad issued $45,000,000 discounted six months notes , to meet the December 1 maturity . The Supreme Court has found against the legality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the substance of Commissioner Anderson 's dissent ; that is , that the commission had no authority to approve the terms upon which bonds might be converted into stock five years hence . The bonds were to carry the privilege of conversion into stock , at par , between October 1 , 1918 , and the same date in 1928 ; were to bear 6% interest , and to be sold to subscribing stockholders at par . Commissioner Anderson held that this amounted to approving now the price at which the company might sell $67,000.000 of its stock five to fifteen years hence . On hearing of the decision , bankers expressed the opinion that it would be hard on the market price of the New Haven 's six months notes , but that obviously the directors would have five months in which to get authority from the stockholders , and from the Massachusetts commission , to issue a similar amount of non-convertible bonds . and arrange to market them . This raises the interesting question whether the New Haven will find it necessary or advisable to create a new mortgage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Haven is unmortgaged ; and tail is true of most of its extremely valuable line between New York and Boston . If the directors thought fit , the company could offer a first mortgage bond of the highest character . Chairman Howard Elliott . of the New Haven , when told of the Supreme Court decision said : " I have not seen the text of the decision and can wake no comment until I have , and until I have discussed it with counsel .
