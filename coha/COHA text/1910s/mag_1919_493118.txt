motives , in spite even of much bad manners and irrelevant truculence , have done what in the long run , and not such a very long run at that , will prove a service to the whole world . But it will be a nega ? tive service , and it might easily be a constructive one . What are the elements of the problem ? First , that the attempt to enforce the policy devised at Paris in 1919 would cause such a deep and permanent feud in civilization as to make inevitable decades of disorder . The treaties framed at Paris are built upon deception of the Allied peoples , and impose conditions upon all the populations east of the Rhine which make recuperation infinitely difficult . There is no peace in them for a stricken world , and therefore there is no advantage in making the desperate attempt to enforce them with American aid . That is the first and the basic element of the problem . The second follows from it : the settle ? ments of Versailles are nothing but an extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convene . The third follows from the other two : it is that the purpose of the Lodge reservations , while more or less applicable to the present treaty , are in the long run an utterly impossible formula of American world policy . They are impossible in the long run because they envisage a world of armed commercial competition , and provide for no adequate international cooperation . Suppose that a Senator , accepting the truth of these propositions , were to spend his Christmas holidays formulating a " compromise " program . What could he propose which would most nearly meet the needs of the situation and still be true to the finest aspirations for which the war was fought ? He would , it seems to us , ratify the treaty with a reservation embodying some such thought as this : That the United States reserves to itself full liberty of action under the terms of this treaty , participating only as a consulting member of the League and as an active member only when its judgment supports a particular decision . That this participation is for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of which period a new world conference shall convene to consider all questions affecting the peace of the world . A reservation of this kind would take care of Article X and all the rest , and at the same time it would provide the believers in the treaty with an opportunity to demonstrate , if they can , that the peace of Versailles has in it the germs of order and reconstruction . The only differences between this proposal and unconditional ratification are that the settlement is frankly acknowledged to be temporary . On the other hand it does avoid all the inconveniences of outright rejection , as well as the humiliating features of the Knox resolution . The effect on Europe would be excellent . It would show that the United States in neither gullible nor unfriendly , that it knew how to avoid the Scylla of Wilson and the Charybdis of Lodge . It would show something far more important , namely , that the American Senate was acting not on a narrow view of American interest but on a conception of world politics as they exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For America can not serve Europe , as President Wilson tried to , by yielding to the politicians or to the crowd psychology of Europe . We are of no use as a pawn . We are of no use as a nation too ignorant to make our detachment serve the cause of peace . The thing that has been dishonored in Europe is not Mr. Wilson ? s signature , but America 's reputation as a free people capable of an independent and constructive policy . The Senate can in some measure restore the prestige of free government , if in ratifying the treaties , it passes judgment upon their terms , acknowledges their meaning , and extends to all mankind the hope of an early revision . That hope must exist among men . The soul of the world is sick with disappointment . The fiasco at Paris robbed men of hope . Some new hope there must be , something for which they can work and strive and think , and no better hope exists than that at the end of a few years the wrongs and futilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European Distress and American Honor When America was balancing the case for and against entering the European War , it was impossible to say whether or not her material interests would be advanced by her belligerency ; but the probabilities ran heavily that the costs would greatly outweigh any material gain . For the twenty-five billion , more or less , that was spent , what assets have we to show ? Our honor saved , and the Germans thrown back from their design of ruling Europe . Those are ideal assets , but what American will say that they were not worth the material cost ? Today Europe is confronted by a peril not incomparable to the German peril . It is the peril of hunger and worklessness , which menaces the lives of ten million or twenty million persons , according to the best authority in the world , Mr. Hoover . That is many more lives than were fed into the furnace of the World War . German menace involved more than millions of lives ; it involved the establishment of new conditions under which what we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the menace of famine ? How much of civilization can survive the decimation of a whole population by hunger , the cramping , physical and mental , of all of a rising generation by malnutrition ? . Will it be to our material interest to come to the relief of Europe ? That is a question that can not be answered with certainty , but the probabilities greatly favor the contention that it will . All the leading authorities on finance agree that we can not escape our share in the ultimate consequences of Europe 's distress . But the calculation of profit and loss is not the essential process in the argument . What is essential is the matter of our national honor . We e have overabundance for ourselves and a surplus . Other peoples that were our allies , or that were enemies indeed but now have paid the penalty and are returned to the community of nations of which we are a part , are starving and disintegrating . Is such a condition in keeping with a nice sense of honor on our part ? When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jugoslavia , we did not promise them that we should look on indifferently while they struggled in vain to reach a firm economic footing . When we demanded of Germany and Austria-Hungary unconditional surrender , we did not proclaim that one of the consequences would be as bitter privations as they had endured in time of war . If we prove that we care nothing about the present fate of Europe , it will bbe be impossible to convince either present or future generations of Europe that our high professions in the late war were anything but humbug . Our record in the war will be smudged , indelibly , if we hold ourselves aloof from all responsibility for the work of restoration . Our professions were not just humbug , and we do in fact desire to help , but how can it be done , practically ? Not by private charity , for however well we might organize ourselves for charitable relief we would reach only an infinitesimal part of the misery and disorder by such means . Not even by public charity , for no kind of gratuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main , work through the normal processes of exchange of values for giving goods at fair prices in return for such values as the peoples needing the goods can offer . They can not offer gold nor goods in adequate volume . They can only offer their credit . That is the basis on which we are now trading with them . Their just grievance against us is that we do not take their credit at a fair value , but at a discount that our makes trade with us ruinous . Take our wheat price , we say in effect , and we will take your sterling or francs or crowns at our price too . And that price we will fix , not according to real considerations of your solvency , but according to considerations of our strategic trading advantages , just as an unscrupulous private dealer , knowing that his customer is solvent and can pay in a year or two may charge one hundred per cent in excess , count ? ing upon the customer 's need . When the French buy wheat of us we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dollars as ten francs or more . Now , there is no question that the French currency is actually depreciated . You can prove that by an analysis of its purchasing power in France . But it is far from having fallen to half its value . Consequently a considerable proportion of the premium on dollars we demand of the French is simply an unjust profit we sweat out of our former Allies . We dock the pound sterling by about a dollar , which is fifty cents too much . We dock the Dutch florin eight per cent , the Swed ? ish crown twenty per cent , the Norwegian twenty-five per cent , the Danish thirty , although all those northern neutrals are sounder financially than they were before the war when we took their money as often at a premium as at a discount . We take the German mark at one-tenth of its nominal value and the Austrian crown for one-thirtieth . Jugoslavia , Czechoslovakia and Poland we treat rather worse than Germany and rather better than Aus ? tria . In all these cases there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are not at all responsible . But in every case the domestic pur ? chasing power of those currencies argues a far higher value than the one we fix in our exchange relations . We mulct them all beyond their sins . Is it a wonder that we are coming to be regarded throughout Europe in the light of detestable extortioners , and that even the French office of re ? construction advises that purchases be made in Ger ? many , when possible , rather than in America ? The Germans have ceased destroying by artillery fire ; we continue to destroy by an exaggerated rate of exchange . That is a condition we can not afford to tolerate longer . We do not need to tolerate it . There is no fundamental reason why we should not take enough British paper , French , Belgian , Dutch , Scan ? dinavian , to restore exchange with those countries to a normal basis . There is a reason why this does not take place automatically . Our banks and our investing public are not accustomed to dealing in long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquire the habit . But the Govern ? ment could correct this difficulty immediately and without loss by raising a loan on its own credit and selling abroad exchange on America at par , so far as actual depreciation does not demand a definite discount . That would restore at once normal com ? mercial relations with western Europe and enable our late Allies and the neutrals to purchase here food and materials and machinery at reasonable prices , as measured in their own currencies . That would not suffice for the graver problems of cen ? tral Europe , but it would help . The revival of commercial movements in the western countries would inevitably stimulate commerce and industry in central Europe too . For central Europe the only adequate remedy is a long term loan , made directly to governments , with restrictions insuring that the sums loaned would be used for provisioning the people and restoring industry , not for military preparations . Such loans would involve some risk of loss . Are the people of America terrified by the thought of some risk ? Let the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering a loan on the terms of the last Liberty loan , which involved a definite sacrifice on the part of subscribers . For the sake of our national honor , let us have a chance to make a sacrifice for the rescue of the peoples of central Europe from famine and despair . But must not the peace be ratified before we can do anything ? That is an argument more cogent with those who wish a particular kind of ratifica ? tion at all costs than with those who are really con ? cerned over Europe . The correction of exchange with western Europe need not wait a moment upon ratification . Neither the need nor the solvency of those countries turns upon the character of our Treaty ratification . Final peace will hasten recov ? ery in central Europe , but its effects will be of a character imperceptible for months . Real and im ? mediate aid to Poland , Czechoslovakia , Austria , Jugoslavia can come only through generous public loans . To raise the funds for such loans will take time , more than will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why are we delaying about it ? Those nations and their needs exist ; their boun ? daries are not to be determined by our Senate , nor the indemnities they are to pay or receive . Do we fear that reparation commissions on which we may or may not be represented will permit the confisca ? tion for other use of the proceeds of loans we make specifically for purposes of rehabilitation ? That is to impute the deepest dishonor to our Allies . No : if we refuse to help Europe , if we delay about it , let us admit frankly that it is because we care only for ourselves . Let us admit that humanity and honor count for little in the motives that rule our international policy . Bungling the Railroad Problem IT has now become apparent that Congress has failed utterly and abjectly in its attempt to initiate and carry through a railroad policy . Despite a year of undisturbed opportunity for investigation and thought , the best advice which expert knowledge and experience could offer , and a complete free hand as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either House which offers the slightest promise of success . And now that Congress has adjourned for the holidays without legislation , with the President ? s promise to return the roads to private ownership on January 1st as yet unmodified , it is apparent that not only has a negative failure been achieved but a positively dangerous and disturbing situation has been created . Only a postponement of the date of return by the President can avert a financial catastrophe . Although as yet no intimation has come from the White House , it now seems probable that the railroads will not be returned on January 1st , and that Congress will be given another interval in which to legislate . To assess the probability of any greater success during this interval , it is necessary to understand why Congress has during the past year failed so completely . In the first place there has been in both House and Senate a persistent and incorrigible tendency to underestimate the difficulty and seriousness of the situation . The leaders in both houses have been content with minor tinkering and patching . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate regulation could be perfected and a few modifications made in the statutory rule of rate making , the traditional American railway policy could be saved . They have not recognized that the disease from which the railroads are suffering is radical , that it goes to the very foundation of our traditional policy , and that only a radical remedy can cure it . The policy of impotent private operation , coupled with irresponsible and cumbersome public regulation , especially in a period of rising costs , of necessity means financial instability . To make public supervision yet more cumbersome , and private management yet more impotent , is no way of curing the disease . In so far as the traditional system ever had any chance of succeeding , the chance was wrecked by competitive rivalries inevitable in a system of separately owned railroad corporations . It is no remedy for this defect to turn these private corporations loose after two years on the leash , with a mandate to spend the next seven years attempting to swallow each other under a system of permissive regional    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
