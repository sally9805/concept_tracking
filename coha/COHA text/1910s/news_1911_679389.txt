txt The income tax amendment is expected to come before the Assembly committee to-day , and to be voted on in the Senate on Thursday . Those in charge of it are represented as hopeful of its passage without much consideration or apposition . That is the way in which the tax started its career , at a time when it was still thought that the Government ought to do almost everything for ? everybody with the taxes which other people would pay . The time has arrived when people generally are preferring lower costs of living to the hopes of beneficence through taxation , and it may be hoped that the merits of this tax will receive more attention than they have received hitherto . When Congress started the amendment on its way through the State Legislatures the idea was to gain support for the Tariff bill . It now seems strange that such a tariff could have been thought worth securing at the sacrifice of principle , but it is the truth that the enactment of this tariff with the help of votes bought with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enactment of the tariff of 1890 with the help of votes bought with the promise of " doing something for silver . " It might be thought that such a precedent would have inspired caution , but here we are with the corporation income tax an actuality , and the general income tax a probability , we are told . One-quarter of the necessary ratifications already have been gathered , and the yeas thus far are twice as numerous as the nays . If the votes could be weighed instead of counted the negative votes might well outbalance the affirmative , the nay of Massachusetts being more than an offset for the yea of Oklahoma , the nay of Virginia being weightier than the yea of Mississippi , and so on through the list . As yet Gov . Hui:inns% opposition has kept New York among the nays , and it is premature to concede all that is claimed by the promoters of the bill . The strongest argument for the bill is the plea of patriotism . It is said that the National Government ought to be armed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; genoy . It is forgotten what a small contribution to the cost of the rebellion the income tax made . The civil war cost billions , More billions since its end than during the-four years of its continuance . If the comparison is confined to the time of hostilities - it. appears that the thconie taxi contributed , shiedmillionsto ... the iced a Of . aatli- balk lopaf , , moa ate - borrowed money . * It is absurd to say . that the smaller sum was vital , and it may be supposed that , in urgent need , a way would be found to collect , it again as before , without the aid of this amendment to the Constitution , which confers upon the Federal Government a great deal more than mere power to collect such an income tax as was collooted during the civil war . It ought not to be forgotten that the Federal Government possesses the power to collect an income tax , provided only that it collects it in a constitutional manner , that is , by apportioning it among the States according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evade this limitation upon the Federal Government under cover of a plea of patriotism . It is an equally weighty plea of patriotism to preserve the constitutional limitation , which has not lost its virtue because the Nation has for a limitation of Federal extravagance than to confer upon it power to lay more taxes in a manner creating the possibility of oppressing individuals , States , and sper-iflo Indus-. tries . As to individuals , it Is necessary to remember that the pending proposal does not limit the income tax to the rich , nor . to payments upon Incomes from investments . Earned incomes are more liable to tax , as well as investment income . Being a direct tax the income tax is not limited by the requirement for uniformity . Any trade may be selected for taxation , and the taxation may be in any degree , with the result that any trade may be taxed out of existence , as the oleomargarine trade was destroyed , and the Issue of State banknotes . When those trades were destroyed the courts refused to prevent it , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been said that we must take our politics from the West , and this is a Western idea . The Constitution knows neither East nor West , and it Is prudent to preserve its restrictions at a time when it is proposed to confer upon Congress the power to discriminate against sections by expressly repealing limitations which have proved their wisdom . For assuredly if this amendment is passed Congress will receive power to discriminate against sections , as well as to discriminate against trades , by , throwing upon any industry the burden of a tax not levied upon others . Thus it appears that the plea of patriotism is really a plea of sectionalism , which is fatal to that patriotism which is National rather than sectional . Neither East nor West . North nor South , should have the temptation which comes from power to relieve itself from burdens by laying them upon others . The limitation of the levy of an income tax by requiring apportionment according to population has a firm basis in reason . No man can support this proposal unless he favors the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it ought of itself to give pause to those who are thinking of reversing the action advised by that Governor of New York who now sits in the Supreme Court . a-
