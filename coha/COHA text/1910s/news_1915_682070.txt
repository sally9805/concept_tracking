txt The No. 4 machine shop of the Bethlehem Steel Company 's plant here was virtually destroyed early this morning by a fire said to have been caused by a short circuit . Persons generally well-informed on conditions in the great munitions plant estimate the loss at from 81,000,000 to S4,000,000 , but the company officers have BO far given Out no figures . In the burned building are said to have been 800 field guns being built for the Allies , and they are supposed to have been deerroyed . From all information at hand there seems no probability that the fire was the result of a plot by agents tif. the Allies ' enemies or of anybody else . Nevertheless , there are two questions that Bethlehem is asking tonight . One has to do with the origin of the fire and the other with the extent of the damage done to this great American war munition plant , now working on contracts worth millions of dollars from Great Britain , France , and Russia . Since the outbreak of the war and the flooding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the war contract business has suffered so serious a loss , perhaps , as that sustained today by the great organization of which Charles DL Schwab is the head . Officials Admit Nothing Suspicious . Officials of the steel company , now in Bethlehem , will not for one instant admit that there was anything suspicious about the origin of the fire ; neither will they admit mat the damage done amounts to a million or more dollars , as many persons in Bethlehem are convinced it did . A. D. Mixsell , who is a Vice President of the company , refused point blank tonight to discuss the fire . All that he would say was that the fire was out and that the Bethlehem Company would proceed in the usual way to fulfill whatever contracts it has on hand . When Mr. Itlizsell was asked if there was any suggestion of incendiarism , he replied rather curtly that the only suggestion of the sort which he had heard appeared in sonic of the New York evening papers . Earlier in the day Mr. Mixsell had issued a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed as one equipped with " smaller machine tools " used in the manufacture of ordnance , and said that it was not possible to make any estimate of the money loss entailed . He admitted that the loss was serious . It . arts understood here tonight that Charles M. Schwab had left White Sulphur Springs , W. Va. , this afternoon on a special train , and would arrive here tomorrow morning to take part in an important conference of officials , at which the damage done and the means to repair it would be discussed and plans made to replace the destroyed building . Plant tinder close Guard . The whole steel plant is under the closest possible guard tonight . The steel company 's entire force under Captain Roach is on duty tonight , and all persons seen it : the vicinity of tile mills are closely scrutinized . It is rumored tonight that the guard will be considerably augmented as a ' result of this morning 's fire , despite the fact that it is officially stated that the fire was not of a suspicious origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was permitted to enter the works today .. The cause of the fire was given by the company as a short circuit which ignited a small quantity of oil in a part of the destroyed building utilized in the manufacture of field guns of the smaller calibres. up to and including , it is understood , those of the 4.5-inch calibre . From a reliable source THY ; Nsw Yeas TIMES correspondent Is informed there were probably 60 ( 1 guns of the light calibres in the building , and of these 150 were crated and ready to be shipped to Europe . The cost of these guns is one of the secrets that Mr. Mixsell did not divulge today . As a matter of fact , the word " gun " did not occur in his statement , nor did he refer to the loss of any in the course of the brief questioning to which he reluctantly submitted tonight . From several sources it was learned tonight that everything possible had been done by persons connected with the steel company to minimize the seriousness of the loss . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 feet wide and 240 feet long . A number of Bethelehem citizens agreed that a good average estimate of the size of th building indicated that it was more than 200 feet wide and was between eon and 701 ) feet long . The building was one of the boring mills and was a combination of the old pattern shop and machine shop No. 4 . Shortly after the war started and when war munition contracts started to flow West the two buildings were combined and increased from one to four stories In height . Says Reconstruction Cost $3,000,000 . The reconstruction and equipment necessary entailed an expenditure , according to a well known citizen of Bethlehem , of about $3,000,000 and as the building was practically destroyed and only the four walls are left standing , it would appear that the loss must be somewhere around that figure and perhaps more if all the hundreds of field guns stored in the building were lost as it is generally understod they were . Was there anything suspicious as to the origin of the fire ? Mr. Mixse11 's statement indicates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the matter tonight . It can be said , however , that there is absolutely no evidence to be had that would indicate that the fire was the result of a conspiracy on the part of foreign or other plotters to damage the , plant . Several months ago it was reported about the city that dynamite bad been found in one of the South Bethlehem sewers which run underneath the steel plant . This report was promptly denied by officials of the company . The fire was discovered about 5 o'clock this morning . It was Just a tiny flame for a few minutes and then suddenly increased to a great sheet of flame , and within less than twenty minutes the entire structure was aflame . Near the burning structure was the great new pattern building , perhaps the most important structure in the entire plant scheme , and also within a stone 's throw of one of the main machine shops where guns of the siege coast defense and other great calibres are made . Neither of these structures was damaged . A stiff wind was blowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the northern end of the building the entire structure quickly became a roaring furnace , and as it was apparent that no effort could save the building the firemen concentrated their efforts to saving the pattern shop and other nearby structures . There were about 800 men in the building at the time , this being the maximum night force for that shop , which in the daytime gives employment to between 1,200 and 1,300 men . All the men escaped , and none of them will lose a single day 's work because of the fire . This afternoon notices were posted that they would all be cared for in other parts of the plant . In addition to the regular fire fighting force of the Bethlehem Company all the fire apparatus from the towns of Bethlehem , South Bethlehem , Northampton Heights , and Fountain Hill , twelve companies in all , were called up to aid in saving the steel plant . The destroyed building is to be immediately rebuilt , but this will take several weeks if not months . Used as it was in the manufacture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a type it is easily understood what an important unit it was in the great plant on the other side of the Lehigh . The building can be quickly replaced but it is a different thing with the equipment . Machinery of the kind used in the manufacture of ordnance is in such great demand , and the number of concerns in this country turning it out is so limited that it was said tonight by ' a man familiar with the ordnance situation in this country that the blg problem would be to replace the destroyed lathes , shapers , drills , boring machines , and other equipment absolute-ly essential in the manufacture of field artillery pieces . In the course of the investigation by TaE TIMES correspondent it was learned that the Bethlehem Company Was turning out guns as big as the famous German 42-centimeter howitzers . It was said that at least two guns of this giant type had already been shipped to England . One of them , it was said , had been sent over in the Orduna and the other In the Transylvania . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been one of those near the building that was destroyed . WILL REBUILD AT ONCE . in the Meantime the General Plant Will Be Kept Going . The New York offices of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation were kept informed by telephone Yesterday regarding the fire at South Bethlehem , but no statement was made regarding the probable monetary loss . Vice President A. D. Mixsell issued the following statement early in the afternoon The north and east wings of No. 4 machine shop , a four-story brick and steel building , 340 feet long by 60 feet wide , were badly damaged by a fire which started on the first floor and which was caused by a short circuit of electric wires igniting oil at one end of the smaller boring mills at about 5 o'clock this morning . The fire is now under control and no other shops are affected or in danger . All of the departments of the works are running , which was made possible by running temporary power lines in some shops in the immediate neighborhood of the fire . " Number 4 machine shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ordnance work , and while the loss is serious it will be the policy of the company to start to rebuild and replace . The shop normally employs about 1,500 men , who will , of course , be used to advantage in other shops of the plant . It is not possible at this time to estimate the loss . Splendid aid was given in getting the fire under control by the fire departments of South Bethlehem , Bethlehem , Saucon Heights , and Fountain Hill , working in conjunction with the steel company 's fire department and high pressure systems . The company takes this means in making prompt acknowledgment of the valued services rendered by the municipal fire departments mentioned . " The company has ample work in other shops of the plant to'which em-ployes of No. 4 shop will be temporarily assigned , and they have all been requested to report for work tomorrow morning , as usual , at whistle time , when they will be assigned to various duties until the burned shop has been replaced .
