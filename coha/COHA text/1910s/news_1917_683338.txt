txt GERMAN-AMERICAN CRITICS . Unfair to the Youth Who Will Make Up the Army . The New-Yorker Staats-Zeitung continues to make war on the United States . In an editorial note in today 's issue , ( Aug. 2 , ) the editor again pours the vials of contempt on an over-tolerant people . Here is today 's sneer : Forty-nine Is the . grand total of all whom the district exemption boards managed to find the first day . The others are either physically unfit , or , if fit , the drafted one insists on his right et last to take care of wife and child , a tender mark of affection which he has hitherto not exhibited . It is not an inspiring picture to be forced daily to read : " Oh , how I burn to fight the Germans  --  but !  - -  -  " And on this " but " goes to smash the scheme to stamp a huge army out of the ground . Is it to bring help as quickly as the allies of America demand ? Indeed , much will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught manhood , before that portion of the youth of America which is fit for service reaches the point where it rushes forward to serve the country . It is a contemptible insinuation that America 's young men are slackers . Americans who know the history of their country know the self-sacrificing heroism that America 's youth when called upon has always shown . If there are slackers among us today it is largely the fault of the pernicious propaganda conducted shamelessly by newspapers like this very New-Yorker Staats-Zeitung , which here seta itself up as America 's sneering critic . This paper does not stand alone . There are plenty like it . There are the Westliche Post , Der Herold des Glaubens , Der Friedensbote , Amerika. all of St. Louis ; there are Vorwrirts and the Germania of Milwaukee ; there is the Illinois Staats-Zeitung of Chicago ; there is the Deutsch-Amerikanische Kriegerzeitung of Cleveland ; there is the Arbeiterzeitung of Buffalo ; there is the Colorado Herold of Denver . All over the country they are doing their dastardly work , mocking our people , our institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to undermine our walls of defense . True Americans they will not influence , but the weak , the wavering , the easygoing , the coward , the slacker , these they can and these they will corrupt with their insidious anti-American jibes as long as we in our criminal tolerance , our sentimental juggling of such phrases as " freedom of the press " leaves them unshackled . " Freedom of the press ! " Americans cherish and will insist on it ? for Americans and in defense of American liberties . License in expression they have never tolerated and should not tolerate . Lest we forget ! " Idiotic Yankees " was what the Kaiser 's military attachd , Captain von Papen , called us . We are " idiotic " if in the midst of a terrible war we allow the enemy within our gates to ... go about slandering the American nation and poisoning the minds of the American people . HERMANN HAGEDORN of the Vigilantes . New York , Aug. 2 , 1917 . A Firm Stand on Food Exports . Tour report In today 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embargo upon all fats to most welcome news . it is a positive fact that this is a most severe blow to Germany , but not only must fats be embargoed , but every other sort of food . and , in fact , supplies of all kinds . There is no easier or less costly way to beat Germany and win the war than by shutting off necessary supplies to our enemy . European neutrals must he deprived of exports , because directly or Indirectly Germany is bound to revolve a large part of these C N. - ports . It is easy to guarantee that our own shipments will not actually be reshipped to Germany , but how can we prevent neutrals from substituting our food for their own food , which would be shipped to Germany ? We are In a serious war and every legitimate weapon must bo used . That these embargoes would be a hardship to European neutrals goes without saying , yet our first duty is to our own cause and we must not be deterred by the complaint of neutrals . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them Join us . We must not be influenced by the neutral commis/dons which are being sent to us . To fall to use this wonderfu ? wespoli would be a terrible crime , for that would mean giving aid to our enemy and would be the cause of prolonging the war and sacrificing needlessly thousands of the lives of our own men . President Wilson is taking a firm stand on the subject , and the press and the country must show the Administration that they have approved and demand the most drastic action for embargoes to neutrals . It is the selfishness of American industry that has allowed this aiding of Germany . The South wants to got the premium price and sales of cotton . The West wants to get the top-notch price for food , and the East has sought to get all she can for her manufactured products . The whole country is equally to blame . These selfish interests ' must be swept aside , and thin powerful weapon of absolute embargoes on all supplies to neutrals must be wielded to its fullest extent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. July 31 , 1017 . Society for the Snubbing of Slackers I recently overheard the following : " Oh . I am so sorry . Mrs.  - -   - -   . I hear your son has been drafted . He will of course apply for exemption . " Mrs.  - -   - -   : " If he did I should never speak to him again . " This is magnificent , and as it should be . Illustrated posters representing the above should be made prominent in every town and village . If a mother is prepared to act in such a way to her son , what about the thousands of girls who could prove so strong a. factor in this matter ? Why not a league , " Daughters of the Nation , " or some such title , members of which would have to stipulate to have nothing to do with a slacker ? lie could not he danced with , walked ? out with , or even spoken to . Could not some of America 's prominent and patriotic women get busy and organize such a sisterhood , which girls would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In every State , with sub-committees in each place of importance , would soon enroll a vast membership . An artistic design for an emblem , to be worn by all members , could quickly be devised . Subscriptions or joining feet which would amount to no mean sum to go to the Red Cross . Ii . D. L. Waterbury , Conn. , Aug. 2 , 1017 . A Way to Divide the Nation . The United States Senate seems to be bent upon prohibition legislation , not in the interest of the people as a whole , and certainly not in the interest of the public revenue , but to please a fanatical minority , drunk with the love of rule and regardless of any one 's freedom except their own . Neither our allies nor our enemies , even after three years of terrific war , would dream of enacting any such unpopular and unnecessary legislation . For us to perpetrate such foolishness at this time , as a " war measure , " before we have actually begun to fight , would not only be to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , for worse , it would surely arouse widespread feelings of resentment and indignation among many millions of our loyal people . both native and foreign born . To force prohibition legislation at this time , when a united nation is of all things most desirable , is to court disaster .
