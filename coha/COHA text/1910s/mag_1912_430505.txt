 | THE UNACCUSTOMED EARS OF EUROPE WHEN , as a child , I learned the Westminster Catechism by heart I found the Ten Commandments easy to remember . There was something straightforward in these prohibitions . Once started in the right direction one could hardly stray from the path . But I stumbled over the question , What are the reasons annexed to the First Commandment ? ' That a commandment should be committed to memory seemed just . I was prepared to submit to the severest tests of verbal accuracy . But t at there should be reasons annexed , ' a that these also should be remembered , seemed to my youthful understanding a grievance . It made the path of the obedient hard . To this day there is a haziness about the reasons ' that contrasts with the sharp outlines of the commandment itself . I fancy that news-gatherers have the same experience . They are diligent in collecting items of news and reporting them to the world , but it is a real hardship to them to have to give any rational account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done in different parts of the world , but they forget to mention the moving why they did it . ' The consequence is that , in this age of inVOL. 110-NO. 4 stantaneous communication , we know what is going on in other countries , but it seems very irrational . The rational elements have been lost in the process of transmission . There has , for example , been no lack of news cabled across the Atlantic in regard to the nominations for President of the United States . The European reader is made aware that a great deal of strong feeling has been evoked , and strong language used . When a picturesque term of reproach has been hurled by one candidate at another it is promptly reported to a waiting world . But the reasons annexed ' are calmly ignored . The consequence is that the reader is confirmed in his exaggerated idea of the nervous irritability of the American people . There seems to be a periodicity in their seizures . At intervals of four years they indulge in an orgy of mutual recrimination , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is all very unaccountable . Doubtless the most charitable explanation is the climate . It was after giving prominence to an unusually vivid bit of vituperation that a conservative London newspaper remarked , ' All this is characteristically American , but it shocks the unaccustomed cars of Europe . As I read the rebuke I felt positively  | ashamed of my country and its untutored ways . I pictured Europe as a dignified lady of mature years listening to the screams issuing from her neighbor 's nursery . She had not been used to hearing naughty words called out in such a loud tone of voice . Instead of discussing their grievances calmly , they were actually calling one another names . It was therefore with a feeling of chastened humility that I turned to the columns devoted to the more decorous doings of Europe . Here I should find examples worthy of consideration . They are drawn from the homes of ancient civility . Would that our rude politicians might be brought under these refining influences and learn how to behave ! But alas ! When we drop in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so tidy as they are on the days at home . ' The hostess is flustered and evidently has troubles of her own . So , as ill-luck would have it , it is with Dame Europe 's household . The visitor from across the Atlantic is surprised at the obstreperousness of the more vigorous members of the family . Evidently a great many interesting things are going on , but the standard of deportment is not high . While the unaccustomed ears of Europe were shocked at the shrill cries from the rival conventions at Chicago and Baltimore , there was equal turbulence in the Italian Parliament at Rome . There were shouts and catcalls and every sign of uncontrollable violence . What are the reasons annexed ' to all this uproar ? I do not know . In Budapest such unparliamentary expressions as swine , ' liar , ' thief , ' and assassin ' were freely used in debate . An honorable member who had been expelled for the use of too strong language , returned to shoot up ' the House . The chairman , after dodg-a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on better order . In the German Reichstag a member threatens the Kaiser with the fate of Charles the First , if he does not speedily mend his ways . He suggests as a fit Imperial residence the castle where the Mad King of Bavaria was allowed to exercise his erratic energies without injury to the commonweal . At the mention of Charles the First the chamber was in an uproar , and amid a tumult of angry voices the session was brought to a close . In Russia , unseemly clamor is kept from the carefully guarded ears of the Czar . There art conspires with nature to produce peace . We read of the Czar 's recent visit to his ancient capital . The police during the previous night made three thousand arrests . The Czar and Czarina drove through the city amid the ringing of bells , and with banners flying . ' On reading this item the American reader plucks up heart . If , during the Chicago convention , the police had made three thousand arrests the sessions might have been as quiet as those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Commons are disappointing to the pilgrim in search of decorum . The Mother of Parliaments has trouble with her unruly brood ' . We-enter the sacred precincts as a member rises to a point of order . I desire to ask your ruling , Mr. Speaker , as to whether the honorable gentleman is entitled to allude to members of the House , as miscreants . ' The Speaker : I do not think the term " miscreant " is a proper Parliamentary expression . ' This is very elementary teaching , but it appears that Mr. Speaker is compelled to repeat his lesson almost daily . It is line upon line and precept upon precept. '  | The records of the doings of the House contain episodes which would be considered exciting in Arizona . We read : For five minutes the Honorable George Lansbury defied the Speaker , insulted the Prime Minister , and scorned the House of Commons . He raved in an ecstasy of passion ; challenging , taunting , and defying . ' The trouble began with a statement of Mr. Asquith 's . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his powerful rasping voice dominating the whole House . Shouting and waving his arms , he approached the government Front Bench with a curious crouching gait , like a boxer leaving his corner in the ring . One or two Liberals on the bench behind Mr. Asquith half rose , but the Prime Minister sat stolidly gazing above the heads of the opposition , his arms folded , and his lips pursed . Mr. Lansbury had worked himself up into a state of frenzy and , facing the Prime Minister , he shouted , " You are beneath my contempt ! Call yourself a gentleman ! You ought to be driven from public life . " ' I can not remember any scene like this in Disraeli 's novels . The House of Commons used to be called the best club in Europe . But that , says the conservative critic , was before the members were paid . II But certain changes , like the increased cost of living , are going on everywhere . The fact seems to be that all over the civilized world there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one country to point the finger of scorn at another , or to assume an air of injured politeness . It is more conducive to good understanding to Join in a general confession of sin . We are all miserable offenders , and there is little to choose between us . The conventionalities which bind society to- gether are like the patent glue we see advertised on the streets . A plate has been broken and then joined together . The strength of the adhesive substance is shown by the way it holds up a stone of considerable weight attached to it . The plate thus mended holds together admirably till it is put in hot water . I have no doubt but that a conservative Chinese gentleman would tell you that since the Republic came in there has been a sad falling-off in the observance of the rules of propriety as laid down by Confucius . The conservative newspapers of England bewail the fact that there has been a lamentable change since the present government came in . The arch offender is that political Mandi , Lloyd George , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British workmen , and who has corrupted the manners of Parliament itself . ' This wicked Mandi , by his appeals to the passions of the populace , has destroyed the old English reverence for Law . I do not know what may be the cause , but the American visitor does notice that the English attitude toward the laws of the realm is not so devout as he had been led to expect . We have from our earlies , ; youth been taught to believe that the law-abidingness of the Englishman was innate and impeccable . It was not that , like the good man of whom the Psalmist speaks , he meditated on the law day and night . He did n't need to . Decent respect for the law was in his blood . He simply could n't help conforming to it . And this impression is confirmed by the things which the tourist goes to see . The stately mansions embowered in green and guarded by immemorial oaks are accepted as symbolic of an ordered life . The multitudinous rooks suggest security which comes from 436 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . When one enters a cathedral close he feels that he is in a land that frowns on the crudity of change . Here everything is a thousand years the same . ' And how decent is the demeanor of a verger ! When the pilgrim from Kansas arrives at an ancient English inn he feels . that he must be on his good behavior . Boots in his green apron is a lesson to him . He is not like a Western hotel bellboy on the way to becoming something else . He knows his place . Everybody in this country knows his place , and there is no unseemly crowding and pushing . And what stronger proof can there be that this is a land where law is reverenced than the demeanor of a London policeman . There is no truculence about him , no show of physical force . He is so mild-eyed and soft of speech that one feels that he has been shielded from rude contact with the world . And so he has been . He represents the Law in a land where law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to wave his hand and traffic stops . When the traveler is told that in the vicinity of the House of Commons traffic is stopped to allow a Member to cross the street , his admiration increases . Fancy a Congressman being treated with such respect ! But the argument which , on the whole , makes the deepest impression is the deferential manners of the tradesmen with their habit of saying , Thank you , ' apropos of nothing at all . It seems an indication of perpetual gratitude over the fact that things are as they are . But when one comes to listen to the talk of the day , one is surprised to find a general lack of docility . I suspect that the Englishman has not nearly as much respect for law as he has for custom . When , therefore , a law is enacted which is opposed to the custom in which he believes , . his instinct is to resist it in a most vigorous and conscientious way . I doubt whether he has the veneration for the abstract idea of Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average American a certain finality about a decision of the Supreme Court . The Law has spoken , let all the land keep silent ! It seems like treason to criticize it . It is anarchy to defy it . To the modern Englishman this attitude seems superstitious . The counsel of perfection is to obey a law till such time as it can be repealed . But this is too tedious a process . The British way is to disobey and take the consequences . There is a long tradition of such heroic non-conformity . Passive resistance ? with such active measures as may make the life of the enforcers of the law a burden to them ? is a popular method . Just at this time every earnest and wide-awake person seems to be engaged in some form of resistance to law . The conscientious women who throw stones through shop windows , and lay violent hands on cabinet ministers , do so , avowedly , to bring certain laws into disrepute . They go on hunger-strikes , not in order to be released from prison , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their methods should be recognized as acts of legitimate warfare . They may be extreme in their actions , but they are not alone in their theory . The Insurance Law , by which all workers whose wages are below a certain sum are compulsorily insured against sickness and the losses that follow it , is just going into effect . Its provisions are necessarily complicated , and its administration must at first be difficult . The Insurance-Law Resisters are organized to nullify the act . Its enormities are held up before all eyes , and it is flouted in every possible way .  | According to this law , a lady is compelled to pay threepence a week toward the insurance fund for each servant in her employ . Will she pay that threepence ? No ! Though twenty acts of Parliament should declare that it must be done , she will resist . As for keeping accounts , and putting stamps in a book , she will do nothing of the kind . What is it about a stamp act that arouses such fierceness of resistance ? High-born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obey such a law . At a meeting at Albert Hall the Resisters were addressed by a duchess who was supported by a man-servant . ' What , can a mere Act of Parliament do when confronted by such a combination as that ? Passive resistance takes on heroic proportions when a duchess and a man-servant confront the Law with haughty immobility . In the meantime , Mr. Tom Mann goes to jail , amid the applause of organized labor , for advising the British soldier not to obey orders when he is commanded to fire on British workingmen . Mr. Tom Mann is a labor agitator , while Mr. Bonar Law is the leader of the Conservative party ; but when it comes to legislation which he does not like , Mr. Bonar Law 's language is fully as incendiary . He is not content with opposing the Irish Home Rule Bill : he gives notice that when it has become a law the opposition will be continued in a more serious form . The passage of the bill , he declares , will be the signal for civil war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rule Bill , but when it does so its troubles will have just begun . Where will it find the troops to coerce the province ? One of the most distinguished Unionist members of Parliament , addressing a great meeting at Belfast says , You are sometimes asked whet her you propose to resist the English army ? 1 reply that even if this Government had the wickedness ( which , on the whole , I believe ) , it is wholly lacking in the nerve required to give an order which in my deliberate judgment would shatter for years the civilization of these islands . ' If the Government does not have the nerve to employ its troops , It will be for the moon-lighters and the cattle-maimers to conquer Ulster themselves , and it will be far you to show whether you are worse men , or your enemies better men , than the forefathers of you both . But I note with satisfaction that you are preparing yourselves by the practice of exercises , and by the submission to discipline , for the struggle which is not unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule you . You are determined not to be ruled . A collision of wills so sharp may well defy the resources of a peaceful solution . . . . On this we are agreed , that the crisis has called into existence one of those supreme issues of conscience amid which the ordinary landmarks of permissible resistance to technical law are submerged . ' When one goes to the Church to escape from these sharp antagonisms , he is confronted with huge placards giving notice of meetings to protest against The Robbery of God . ' The robber in this case is the Government , which proposes to disendow , as well as disestablish , the Church in Wales . Noble lords denounce the outrage . Mr. Lloyd George replies by reminding their lordships that their landed estates were , before the dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII , Church propert y. 1 f they wish to make restitution of the spoil which their ancestors took , %%ell and good . But let them not . tall , about the robbery of God , while their hands are dripping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is effective , but it does not make Mr. Lloyd George beloved  | by the people to whom it is addressed . Twitting on facts has always been considered unmannerly . III When we hear the acrimonious discussions and the threats of violence , we feel that there must have been a mistake in our political geography . There is a manifest lack of the English ' reverence for laws ourselves have made . ' Indeed , the laws seem to be flouted in the most remarkable manner . What is the reason for this falling-off in qualities which we have been taught to admire ? I think the reason is one that is not discreditable to all concerned . These are not ordinary times , and they are not to be judged by ordinary standards . England is at the present time passing through a revolution , the issues of which are still in doubt . Revolutionary passions have been liberated by the rapid course of events . Every battle of the warrior is with confused noise . ' The confused noise may be disagreeable to persons of sensitive nerves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we consider the nature of the changes that have been made in the last few years , and the magnitude of those which are proposed , we do not wonder at the tone of exasperation which is common to all parties . It is seldom that a constitutional change , like that which deprived the House of Lords of powers exercised for a thousand years , has been made without an appeal to arms . But there was no civil war . Perhaps the old fashion of sturdy blows would have been less trying to the temper . A revolution is at the best an unmannerly proceeding . It can not be carried on politely , because it involves not so much a change of ideas and methods as a change of masters . A change of ideas may be discussed in an amiable and orderly way . The honorable gentlemen who have the responsibility for the decision are respectfully asked to revise their opinions in the light of new evidence which , by their leave , will be presented . But a change of masters can not be managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revise their opinions . They are told that their opinions are no longer asked for . The matter is severely personal . The statement is not , We do not believe in your ideas ' ; it is , We do not believe in you . ' When political discussion takes this turn , then there is an end to the amenities suited to a more quiet time . It is no longer a question as to which is the better cause , but as to which is the better man . Mr. Asquith , who has retained in this revolutionary period the manners of the old school , recently said in his reply to a delegation of his opponents , When people are on opposite sides of a chasm they may be courteous to one another , and regret the impossibility of their shaking hands , or doing more than wave a courteous gesture across so wide a space . ' These are the words of a gentleman in politics , and express a beautiful ideal . But they hardly describe the present situation . As to waving a courteous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that depends on who the people are . If you know them and have been long familiar with their good qualities , the courteous salutation is natural . They are , as you know , much better than their opinions . But it is different when they are people whom you do not know , and with whom you have ' nothing in common . You suspect their motives , and feel a contempt for their abilities . They are not of your set . The word  | gentleman ' is derived from the word gens . People of the same gens learn to treat each other in a considerate way . Even when they differ they remember what is due to gentle blood and gentle training . It is quite evident that the challenge of the new democracy to the old ruling classes has everywhere produced exasperation , and nowhere so much as in England . It is no longer easy to wave courteous salutations across the chasms which divide parties . Political discussion takes a rude turn . The cry is heard , Turn the rascals out ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We may expect the minor moralities to suffer while the major moralities are being determined by hard knocks . Good manners depend on the tacit understanding of all parties as to their relations to one another . Nothing can be more brutal than for one to claim superiority , or more rude than for another to dispute the claim . Such things should , if they exist , be taken for granted . Relations which were established by force may , after a time , be made so beautiful that their origin is forgotten . There must be no display of unnecessary force . The battle having been decided , victor and vanquished change parts . It pleases the conqueror to sign himself , Your obedient servant , ' and to inquire whether certain terms would be agreeable . Of course they would be agreeable . So says the disarmed man looking upward to his late foe , now become his protector . And the conqueror with grave goodwill takes up the burden which Providence has imposed upon him . Is not the motto of the true knight , Ic/a ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given ungrudgingly . Now , t his is not hypocrisy . It may be Christianity and Chivalry and all sorts of fine things . It is making the best of an accepted situation . When relations which were established by force have been sanctioned by custom , and embodied in law , and sanctified by religion , they form a soil in which many pleasant things may grow . In the vicinity of Vesuvius they will tell you that the best soils are of volcanic origin . Hodge and Sir Lionel weed in the garden which one owns , and in which the other digs with the sweat of his brow . There is kindly interest on the one hand , and decent respect on the other . But all this sense of ordered righteousness is dependent on one condition . Neither must eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge that grows in the midst of the garden . A little knowledge is dangerous , a good deal of knowledge may be even more dangerous , to the relations which custom has established . What right has Sir Lionel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not Hodge have a right to have his point of view considered ? When Hodge begins seriously to ponder this question his manners suffer . And when Sir Lionel begins to assert his superiority , instead of taking it for granted , his behavior lacks its easy charm . It is very hard to explain such things in a gentlemanly way . Now , the exasperation in the tone of political discussion in England is largely explained by the fact that all sorts of superiorities have been challenged at the same time . Everywhere the issue is sharply made , Who shall rule ? ' Shall Ireland any longer submit to be ruled by the English ? The Irish Nationalists swear by all the saints that , rather than submit , they will overthrow the present government and return to their former methods of agitation . If the Home Rule Bill be enacted into law , will Ulster submit to be ruled 440 THE UNACCUSTOME :  | by a Catholic majority ? The men of Ulster call upon the spirits of their heroic sires , who triumphed at the Boyne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the masses of the people submit any longer to the existing inequalities in political representation ? No ! They demand immediate recognition of the principle , One man , one vote . ' The many will not allow the few to make laws for them . Will the women of England kindly wait a little till their demands can be considered in a dignified way ? No ! They will not take their place in the waiting-line . Others get what they want by pushing ; so will they . Will the Labor party be a little less noisy and insistent in its demands ? All will come in time , but one Reform must say to another , After you . ' Hoarse voices cry , ' We care nothing for etiquette , we must have what we demand , and have it at once . We can not stand still . If we are pushing , we are also pushed from behind . If you do not give us what we ask for , the Socialists and the Syndicalists will be upon you . ' There is always the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starved into submission . But two can play at that game . Iv This is not the England of Sir Roger de Coverly with its cheerful contentment with the actual , and its deference for all sorts of dignitaries . It is not , in its present temper , a model of propriety . But , in my judgment , it is all the more interesting . To say that England is in the midst of a revolution is not to say that some dreadful disaster is impending . It only means that this is a time when events move very rapidly , and when precedents count for little . But it is a time when common sense and courage and energy count for a great deal ; and there is no evidence that these qualities are lacking . I suspect that the alarmists are not so alarmed as their language would lead us to suppose . They know their countrymen , and that they have the good sense to avoid most of the collisions that they declare to be inevitable . I take comfort in the philosophy which I glean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of vantage I look down upon pedestrian humanity as a Superman might look down upon it . It seems to consist of a vast multitude of ignorant folk who are predestined to immediate annihilation . As the ungainly machine on which I am seated rushes down the street , it seems admirably adapted for its mission of destruction . The barricade in front of me , devoted to the praise of BOVRIL , is just high enough to prevent my seeing what actually happens , but it gives a blood-curdling view of catastrophes that are imminent . I have an impression of a procession of innocent victims rushing heedlessly upon destruction . Three yards in front of the onrushing wheels is an old gentleman crossing the street . He suddenly stops . There is , humanly speaking , no hope for him . Two nursemaids appear in the field of danger . A butcher 's boy on a bicycle steers directly for the bus . He may be given up for lost . I am not able to see what becomes of them , but I am prepared for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the bus goes on . Between Notting Hill Gate and Charing Cross I have seen eighteen persons disappear in this mysterious fashion . I could swear that when I last saw them it seemed too late for them to escape their doom . But on sober reflection I come to the conclusion that I should have taken a more hopeful view if I had not been so  | high up ; if , for example , I had been sitting with the driver where I could have seen what happened at the last moment . There was much comfort in the old couplet : ? Betwixt the saddle and the ground , He mercy sought and mercy found . And , betwixt the pedestrian and the motor-bus , there are many chances of safety that I could not foresee . The old gentleman was perhaps more spry than he looked . The nursemaids and the butcher 's boy must assuredly have perished unless they happened to have their wits about them . But in all probability they did have their wits about them , and so did the driver of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
