txt // famous Bushmen paintings . The purpose of such drawings is undoubtedly to control , by sympathetic magic , the fortunes of the chase . ' In the next stage of French Palaeolithic art , which is represented by the cave of Azil , the reindeer had apparently disappeared , and the red deer had alone survived . In fact the realistic art of the Magdalenian period suddenly vanishes in the Azilian  --  the closing phase of the Palaeolithic epoch . There is no working in ivory , as the mammoth had disappeared with the bison and reindeer , and thus made room for the existing fauna , characterised by the red deer . Although horses , cattle , pigs , etc. , were the companions of the Azilians , these later Palaeolithic folk appear to have been as ignorant of the rearing of domestic animals as they were of agriculture . It should , however , be pointed out in this connexion that in the cavern Mas d'Azil , together with the heaps of burnt wheat , stones of plums , sloe and bird-cherries , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most ancient hand-mills for grinding corn are those discovered in Campigny ( France ) in strata more recent than the Azilian . The manufacture of pottery and the arts of spinning and weaving were also unknown in the Palaeolithic Age.2 The only remains of the CUJLTURE OI PRIMEVAL MAN s Magdalenian artistic development are a few generalised representations made with a paste of ashes , and pebbles marked with stripes or dots . These latter bear a certain resemblance to the designs on the sacred churinga among the Arunta tribe of Central Australia , and to the engravings on the racks at Pigeon Creek in Queensland . M. Piette claims an alphabetical significance for some of these graphic signs , ' but it seems more probable to explain them as totemic in origin . The flint working during the close of the Palaeolithic period shows signs of a return to Aurignacian types ; the keeled scraper and the burin reappear , while the tiny flints known as pygmy flints , which are occasionally found in the Aurignacian , now become one of the characteristic features of the industry . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure only 136th inch in size . It seems highly improbable that they belong to any one particular industry , since they are found from t lie Aurignacian to the Bronze Age . All kinds of explanations have been offered as to their use . Some archaeologists suggest that they were scrapers or ' : dives , others that they were fish-hooks ( which an-l-JRUUUCTION ' 1'O ANTHROPOLOGY is very unlikely , as the la.gdalcnians used bone intl ) lentet ? ts for this Intrliose ) Ot employed in tattooing . The most , absurd of all suggestions is t hat 1 hey , ire t lie normal implements of a relatively small pygmy race . It is reasonable to imagine that , the flints were fixed into wooden handles and used as saws and razors , and possibly on to heavy clubs as a means of making the weapon more effective . Neolithic harpoons have been discovered studded with rows of tiny flints , and in Egypt saws are represented in some of the ancient monuments . A tool of this kind was also found in a peat-moss at Palada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the broad , flat , harpoon usually fitted with two rows of barbs and a hole at the base through which the string passes . This weapon is made from the antler of the stag . The only bone implements are awls and punches . Judging from the fact that remains of the Azilian industry are sporadically scattered over nearly the whole of the western hemisphere , it seems that the close of the Palaeolithic period was characterised by great movements of peoples . When at the end of the Glacial epoch the ice retreated towards the pole , ample space was afforded for racial expansion . As we pass from the Palaeolithic to the Neolithic period we find great changes not only in the mode of life of the people but in the geographical distribution of land and sea . Hither10 Britain was part of the Continent of Europe , but with the dawn of the Neolithic , land submergenres took place which separated Britain and the 1'hannel Islands from the mainland , leaving traces here and there of submerged forests in the North Sea , the English Channel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flora quickly disappeared , giving place to animals chase becoming scarce he gave up his nomadic life for a more settled existence , domest icuting a number of the animals by which he was surrounded ( horse , dog , sheep , goat , etc. ) , and cultivating the " kindly fruits of the earth " ( wheat , barley , millet , fruits , etc . ) . Whether this new departure was a result of immigration of new races into Europe , or whether it was merely an outcome of t la , new environment on a people directly descended from Palaeolithic man it is difficult to say . At any rate the experiment was eminently satisfactory . From agriculturalists Neolithic man became nccltta.inted with the useful arts  --  the manufacture of cloth by spinning and weaving wool and fibrous textures ; ' the making of pottery , etc.  --  but // apparently he was absolutely devoid of that particular artistic taste that led the people of the later Palaeolithic epoch to decorate the walls of their caves and engrave designs on pieces of mammoth tusk . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Age were spent in the erection of houses , and the making of clothing , utensils , etc. , and the various features of which make for civilization . The flint industry continued much the same as in the later stages of the Palaeolithic period , except that , after flaking the iniplernent to the desired shape , the Neolithic workers often ground and polished it , thereby improving not only the appearance but also the cutting edge . The flint arrowhead became a characteristic feature in the new industry . So great is the contrast between the tools of the later Palaeolithic and those of the Neolithic Age that several archaeologists have maintained that there must have been a hiatus between the two periods . The discoveries , however , at the cavern of Mas d'Azil suggest an intermediate stage between the two cultures , which may reasonably be supposed to link up the apparently divergent civilizations . For here we have Palaeolithic hunters living side by side with existing types of animals , but unacquainted with the use of pottery , and possibly in the earliest stages of agriculture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mesolithic period , " intermediate between the Palaeolithic and Neolithic , is represented by such forms as those found in the chalk rubble at Birling Gap , near Eastbourne . The animal remains at this site showed a complete mixture of Pleistocene and recent forms : musk ox , bear , cave hyena , elk , wolf , deer , fox . The flints of the early Neolithic period are often rough axe-like weapons , resembling in many cases Mousterian types . In Norfolk , at Grime 's Graves , and in Sussex at Cissbury near Worthing , disused flint mines have been discovered , and a quantity of implements , hammer stones , etc. , excavated . These were at one time put forth as a proof of a ? mesolithic period , because they showed forms like the Neolithic , but at the same time no evidence of polishing . ) But since Cissbury is usually regarded as a factory site the absence of polished implements is explained by supposing them to have been sent away while the wasters and unground celts remain . ' Fliere is a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American site which shows implements in every stage of manufacture , in percentages decreasing from the roughest to the most nearly finished . It would not be difficult to mistake some of the early stages for Palaeolithic formes , though the finished product is a fine leafshaped point . Bearing this fact in mind , we may // turn to the lively controversy that has taken place regarding the age of these finds since Mr. Reginald Smith , of the British Museum , read a paper before the Society of Antiquaries on May 9th , 1912 , in which he assigned the Grime 's Graves and Cissbury flint-mines to the Palaeolithic , connecting the typical Cissbury celt with the transitional period between Moustier and Aurignac , of which the typical site is Abri Audi . t At the suggestion of Mr. Reginald Smith the writer recently examined a site at Stourpaine , in Dorsetshire , where this particular type of celt has been found , but as all the specimens he discovered were " surface " finds , he concludes that the evidence from this district is unconvincing . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are Neolithic , since the plough in chalk downs would in all probability go below the six inches of soil , and therefore it may easily throw up Palaeolithic forms . At Grime 's Graves and Cissbury , however , we are dealing with disused mines , with deer-horn picks embedded in the strata , just as the prehistoric miners left them , and containing the actual marks of the stone axes on the walls of the subterranean galleries proceeding from the shafts . In such sites as these there is abundant opportunity for accurate investigation . The implements procured from these mines // undoubtedly bear a striking similarity to midpalaeolithic types , but taken in conjunction with other facts the conclusion in favour of a " Cave " date for the deposits is not so obvious . So far no traces of exclusively Pleistocene fauna have been recorded from these mines , all the animal remains  - -  horse , red-deer , sheep , dog , fox , beaver , etc. , being characteristic of a Neolithic deposit . Of course it , is possible that these animals may have existed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say the least , that there is no evidence of the exc1usively mid-palaeolithic fauna . Surely fragments of mammoth , bison , cave bear , Rhinoceros tichorinus , or R. merckii must have survived in these mines as in all well authenticated Mousterian sites . Again , the antler picks , found in abundance at ( rune 's Graves , are typical of Neolithic deposits , while the flora  --  oak , pine , beech , yew , spruce  --  and 1 ) ut t e.ry point to the same conclusion . As regards t lie Ili'Its , it must be confessed  --  after spending an interesting hour with Mr. Reginald Smith at the British Museum  --  that the present writer sees a remarkable similarity of culture between Grime 's Waves and certain Mousterian caves , as , for exitnulcle , La Cotte de St. Brelade , Jersey . But analogy of type is not sufficient evidence to prove that t he flint mines at Grime 's Graves and Cissbury are lucisterian or Aurignacian factory sites , especially // as implements of the same patina and form occur in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc . Even the tortoise core and facetted butt , upon which the argument in favour of a Palaeolithic date for the deposits is largely based , are not unknown in neighbouring Neolithic deposits ( Weeting , Beechamwell , etc. ) , where large blocks of flint have had to be reduced to workable dimensions . Viewing all the available facts , while admitting the strength of the case for a Palaeolithic date of the implements , we feel bound to follow the orthodox path until further geological and archaeological evidence is forthcoming , and regard the worker at Grime 's Graves as a small , dark , long-headed Neolithic man  --  one of the invaders from the south who discovered the art of pottery-making , of domesticating animals and planting crops , and who probably succeeded in driving Palaeolithic man northwards , whither the reindeer had ere this retreated . Here at Grime 's Graves lay scattered about in all directions spear-heads , hatchets , scrapers and discs bearing a striking resemblance to those of the Mousterian culture , together with hammer stones , cores , red-deer antlers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none other than a Neolithic workshop ? The flints were evidently worked on the spot , as battered hammer stones , cores and flakes , as well as finished // implements such as axe-heads , scrapers , and borers are found in the fields around . The axe-heads were no doubt made in such factories as these and then taken away to be ground and polished , the grindstone being a large flat slab of rock or boulder , on which the implement was rubbed ( often with the assistance of sand ) backwards and forwards wit i l a smooth surface was obtained . A word here should be added on the famous kitchen middens ( kjokken moddinger ) of Denmark t he large mounds , consisting of kitchen refuse ( shells , bones , implements , and fragments of pottery ) , discovered early in the last century along the eastern shores . Similar heaps have been found in t lw British Isles , in France , and , at the present day , at Tierra Del Fuego and many other parts . I n Denmark they appear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Neolithic Age , for the implements are of a rude description and unground , although some of the flakes show evidence of considerable skill on the part of those who produced them . The animal bones are chiefly those of the stag , wild boar , wolffox , and roe-deer . No trace of the reindeer , horse Or sheep has been found . The presence of the capercailzie , a bird extinct in Denmark since thedestruction of pine forests , shows the antiquity of the Danish middens . There is no trace of domestic animals , nor of cultivated cereals . The most characteristic home of Neolithic man // was the pit dwelling . A circular pit , similar to that found among the Bushmen , was dug in the ground to a depth of several feet . This was roofed with wattle and daub , and often surrounded by an earthen mound . 1 n these habitations scrapers , arrow-heads , Celts , saws , drills , flakes , cores , hammer stones , fragments of coarse pottery , grain crushers , and bronze and iron implements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even Roman coins shows that this form of dwelling survived long after Neolithic times , although before the first traces of metal had appeared higher types of houses were being built . Thus a cluster of pit dwellings have been found at Grossgartach , Wurtemberg , in which separate rooms are constructed . On the banks of lakes in Switzerland and elsewhere some of the Neolithic tribes erected what are known as pile dwellings  --  houses built on stout poles , over the water on the shores of lakes . The security afforded by natural islands probably first suggested the idea of constructing dwellings on lakes . The situation was advantageous for many reasons , but chiefly for the protection it offered against attack by man and beast , and the ease with which a plentiful supply of fish could be obtained . It is therefore not surprising that a great number of such villages came into existence during the Neolithic and Bronze Ages in Central // Eruope , once the idea was put into effect , and have lingered on to the present day in New Guinea , Borneo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Britain pile dwellings ( called Crannogs ) do not appear to have been constructed before the Bronze Age , and frequently they belong to late Celtic and Romano-British times . Thus , the well known lake village of Glastonbury has revealed a valuable collection of relics of late Celtic civilization . The antiquities discovered in the settlements show that this manner of life extended from Neolithic times through the whole of the Bronze Age into the early Iron Age . The remains found on t here sites throw considerable light on the manners and customs of man in the Neolithic and Bronze periods . The number of domestic animals appear to have been small , and the food supply furnished by the wilder species . The horse , pig and sheep were rare until the Bronze Age . Wheat , barley and millet were cultivated by the lake dwellers . Garments woven from flax supplemented skins for clothing . Numerous earthenware vessels which have been discovered testify to the progress made the art of the potter . Flaked celts subsequently mud and polished  --  often made of diorite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Is , knives , hammers and corn-crushers were Oho frequently used by the Neolithic pile-dwellers. ' // With the close of the Neolithic period we must leave the culture of primeval man , as with the introduction of metals the progress of civilization made such rapid strides that a separate chapter on the beginnings of civilization must be devoted to the culture of the Metal Ages . Our endeavour in this chapter has been to survey briefly the human artefacts of the Stone Age in their entirety . Ere the Palaeolithic period closed man had attained a complete mastery over the flint industry . In the subsequent Neolithic Age his attentions were distracted by the rise of such arts as pottery-making , weaving , etc. , the practice of agriculture and the domestication of animals . As a flint worker , therefore , he tended to deteriorate , although there are many very brilliant exceptions to this rule . Throughout the whole of the Stone Age there is a gradual evolution in culture , which , as we shall see in the next chapter , was not confined to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III . THE E MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF PRIMEVAL MAN . The following description of the life of early man , from the pen of Mr. Worthington Smith , in his work , Man , the Primeval Savage , may serve by way of introduction , and incidentally of criticism , to a discussion on the manners and customs of our ancient ancestors : " If we imagine the darkness to have lifted , we see the men and women standing about or crouching - rnany carrying bones and stone tools  --  near etas . There is one central fire and several minor fires hounding the fringes of the human haunt . The fires are kindled from sparks ( derived from concussion of flints ) applied to dried grass . Some of t he men and women are feeding the flames with ferns , twigs , tree-branches , and logs . Other men t women are seen sitting or lying about in dens hovels formed of tree-branches and stones , or resting under bushes , trees , fallen trunks , or natural Raring hanks of earth . Hairy children are seen running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-putrid meat attached , are seen 93 // strewn about in all directions . . . . The women have gestures and sounds sufficient for their wants . At a signal of danger they point and imitate the roar of the lion , the growl of the bear , or the bellowing of the elk . Sorne of the female adults are seen to be nursing or suckling hairy infants . Some of the older and feebler males and females are seen walking with branches or sticks hacked from trees . Some , especially the young people and children , are full of vivacity and frolic , others are in illhealth , burnt with fever or wheezing and coughing , with colds . . . . Fever patients , consumptives , the blind , the half-blind , and fractious children are driven off and killed , for the earliest human savages probably possessed but scant sympathy for either pleasure or pain in their fellows . He did not bury his dead , and our remote precursors probably paid little or no more attention to a human being than a dog now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Death was not foreseen or understood . A dead man was really a man lying down who did not , could not , or would not get up again. , His carcass was left for wolves and hyenas . . . . Any curiously twisted or contorted branch or twig , any curious stone or fossil , he would pick up , examine , smell , and possibly dread . Perhaps primeval men set up fetiches in their haunts . . . . Of course there was no marriage , but there was pairing , and it is probable that one male would // keep more or less to one female , but only till one birth had taken place . After one birth there would probably be fresh pairing . . . . At pairing seasons there would be terrific roaring , yelling , biting , and fighting amongst the males . The weaker males would be torn and killed , and left for the hyenas ; the fittest , strongest , and handsomest would survive . " This dreary picture of " Man , the Primeval Savage , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a primitive state of culture portrayed by Sir James Frazer in The Golden Bough . . I list , as the latter writer represents the savage of to-day as the victim of all kinds of hallucinations , and the prey of malignant spirits at every turn , the former regards the customs and manners of prmeval man as more brute-like than those of the lowest savages , now existing . No doubt the theory of a gradual development from a creature like Pithecanthropus has led many anthropologists to see in Palaeolithic man nothing but a rude , toolmaking animal , devoid of all ordered social organization , and incapable of any conception of religion . With the discovery of human remains bearing a striking resemblance to modern man , in the very early gravels , primeval man has been regarded as capable of something more than mere tool-making . In face the high degree of skill attained in the later // Palaeolithic  --  especially during the Solutrean culture-phase  --  suggests that the being who made the wonderful " laurel-leaf " lance-heads , delicately flaked on both sides , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endowed with an artistic intelligence such as is not possessed by primitive man of to-day . Unfortunately we have no time-machine by which to revisit the scene of man 's earliest life in this world . 1311t , by laboriously combining the evidence derived from the discoveries of the implements , caves , river-gravels , settlements , and other works of primeval man , together with that of his bones , and then interpreting these survivals in the light of modern primitive culture , we are able to determine to some extent the manner of man our ancestor was , the kind of life he led , and the customs and rites he practised . In the last chapter we had a glimpse of " Man , the primeval tool-maker , " and from the evidence of human artefacts alone we see that Mr. Worthington Smith 's " primeval savage " was an exceedingly skilful artificer . Furthermore , in later Palaeolithic times he was an artist and an engraver of no small ability . Can it be , we repeat , that the being who was responsible for these Palaeolithic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fighting , fever-stricken creature , without natural sympathy and devoid of all social and religious // organization , as he is portrayed to have been by Mr. Worthington Smith ? 1 His assumption is , of course , pure conjecture  --  as , to a certain extent , must be every picture of the mode of life of early man which is not supported by evidence from existing races now in the Stone Age . In the very earliest stages of human development i t , is , of course , true that man was very primitive in his way of life . The person who first exercised his handicraft on chipping flint for a specific use was doubtless very much more rudimentary in his habits than his skilled descendants in the later Pa1aeolithic . But even so , unless we are prepared to identify Homo Primigenius with proto-man a sort of Prepithecanthropus inhabiting the earth in the Oligocene or Miocene epochs of the Tertiary period  --  we shall find it difficult to fit in 1 he archaeological and the anthropological evidence to the requirements of Mr. Worthington Smith 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are content to confine our attention to the definitely human being that arose at the end of the Pliocene or the beginning of the Pleistocene , till such time as sufficient , evidence is forthcoming of the existence awl habits of the hypothetical potential ancestor of Homo Primigenius. // I Let us now try and visualize man as he was at the earliest known human stage of evolution . As regards stature he was not very different from modern man , but with a longer body and arms and shorter legs . The head was not abnormally small , but invariably dolichocephalic ; the jaw was powerful and prognathous , but the chin receded . The brow ridges were probably prominent and the nose broad . Until he became a hunter of large animals he would be presumably unclothed , as he would not have skins at his disposal . Furthermore , fur-bearing animals were not plentiful in the warm climate prior to the Glacial period . It may be therefore reasonably supposed that clothing , like cave-dwelling , was one of the arts of life learnt by man in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . fire , though familiar to man from the I beginning , was not used by him till he had learnt the secret of its properties and devised some means of obtaining it . How and when this was accomplished is not known . In the early Pleistocene there is evidence of its existence , as , for example , in the hearths discovered in Mousterian sites . There are two obvious sources of natural fire  - -  lightning and volcanic lava . The latter is limited to certain areas , and the former would be but sporadic . Moreover , at such conflagrations he would be so terrified that he would not be in a // position to appreciate the result . Another way in which forest fires are accidentally kindled is by friction of boughs in a stormy wind creating a dust that in due course would ignite . In the sort of climate in which earliest man apparently lived bamboo , and the sort of wood that most readily ignites by attrition , would be plentiful , and , therefore , it is possible that an observant mind experimented in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire by rubbing together two pieces of wood . This suggestion is supported by the widely distributed custom of frictional fire-making among primitive people to-day , and , all things considered , appears to be the most probable explanation of the origin of lire . Having discovered a method by which fire could be obtained , it would not be long before our primeval ancestors found abundant uses for this all-essential phenomenon . It would soon be ascertained that lire was a means of safety from the attacks of hot+tile animals , and that cooked food is more 1 . ' 1 ; 0 h le than raw flesh . The hardening effect of t Ins force would be of much value in the manufacturinh of spears , etc . Little wonder then that , in process of time , it came to be regarded with super-awe as a gift from heaven . Passing from the arts of life to the question of ; 1I social organization , we are at once faced // with very difficult and complex problems . Obviously little light can be gleaned from archaeological remains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation , on the one hand , and , on the other , to those races which have remained in more or less a Palaeolithic stage of culture . Many of the lower creatures , such as baboons , monkeys , dogs , bees , etc. , live in communities governed by a chief who controls the movements of the troop . On the death of one leader another is assigned to the office by the general consent of the herd ; strength , size , and shrewdness being the qualifications usually demanded for the position . The community is divided into smaller groups  --  families  --  each of which is allotted a special territory , with definitely established boundaries . A regular system of mating , often of a semi-permanent type , is common among the higher animals , constituting a prototype of primeval marriage . It seems that earliest man inherited from his ancestors in the lower creation the instinct of a social organization which developed into the system still set forth by modern races of primitive people . It is , of course , open to argue that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now extinct Tasmanians , have had countless ages in which to evolve social and religious systems which was not the case with Pleistocene man . On the other hand , it may be contended that the same people have also had equal time to degenerate // in an isolated environment . Be this as it may , it is now recognised by anthropologists that , for purposes of securing a working hypothesis , the manners , customs , and beliefs of modern savages may be taken as a standard from which to deduce general principles . We will , therefore , now proceed to a further investigation of the manners and customs of primeval man by the method of reasoning by analogy . Of all recent races of man in a primitive state of culture the Tasmanians were the lowest . When they became extinct in the latter part of the nineteenth century , they were still living in the Palaeolithic age  --  some have gone so far as to describe them as an Eolithic race , since their implements were made by simply chipping a piece of flint in eolithic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is inclined to regard them as representing a separate industry , while Prof. Sollas inclines to ' I ' I u is opinion that they resemble the Mousterian culture . The flints in question were made from artificially produced flakes , in a few cases with neatly trimmed edges , but mostly showing an irregular outline . The implements may , therefore , be , Na rely described as pre-Aurignacian in character , . and , unless they belong to a separate industry , they can perhaps most correctly be assigned to an early stage of the Mousterian . Huxley regarded both 1 he Australian and Tasmanian skulls as more // or less Neanderthaloid , and some authorities have actually described these races as survivals of Neanderthal man . But the type has little in common with the Neanderthals , except in so far as they are platycephalic and show a retreating forehead , flattened occi put , prominent supra-orbital ridges , and slightly developed chin . Boule therefore seems justified in concluding that " all these modern so-called Neanderthaloids ' are nothing more than varieties of individuals of homo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traits which are normally developed in all specimens of Homo Neanderthalensis . " It would , therefore , seem that there is reason to regard the race as unchanged descendants of an independent stock  --  Ilomto sapiens tasmanianus , as Dr. Sergi calls it . In any case the Tasmanians were a Palaeolithic race , surviving but little changed throughout the ages . Most unfortunately , practically nothing is known of these highly interesting and instructive people beside the fact that they lived a nomadic hunting life , wore little or no clothing , except in winter , when skins were sometimes worn , and that they used flint and wood implements . They were certainly acquainted with fire , which they made by rubbing the pointed end of a stick to and fro in a groove cut out in another piece of wood , or by footnote i Ext . Ann . Pal . 1913 , pp. 66-75. // rotating one stick on another in a hole . They made rough attempts at drawing and painting which compare favourably with the efforts of Magdalenian man . With canoes proper they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a useful substitute , consisting of a bark " raft , " made by lashing together with coarse grass the bark of the eucalyptus tree . But of their social and religious organization nothing is known . ' Of the other primitive race still in the Stone Age more has been determined , thanks to the researches of Messrs . Spencer and Gillen , Dr. Howitt , Ling Roth , and other first-hand investigators . It is now generally admitted by anthropologists that of all surviving races the Australians are apparently the lowest in culture , and nearest to the primeval type . In their native state they are unacquainted with the use of metals , pottery , and agriculture , nor do they practise any of the arts and industries found in the higher civilizations . Their flint implements and bone awls resemble in certain aspects Magdalenian types , while their polished celts show Neolithic characteristics . But with this latter exception the Australians are still in a Palaeolithic stage of culture , a conclusion supported , with the aformentioned reservations , by their physical features . The low retreating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small // capacity , large teeth , prominent brow-ridges , and dolichocephalic skull , all suggest Palaeolithic characteristics . The origin . of the people will be considered in a later chapter . Suffice it to say here that although the Australians are not necessarily direct descendants of the species that inhabited Europe in the mid-Pleistocene , they must have become isolated at a very early period while still living a life of primitive simplicity . This is suggested by the absence of all traditions and myths relating to their migration to the continent . Moreover , they agree in type so closely among themselves that they are now regarded as a distinct race . The Australian is a cheerful , but treacherous , individual , who lives on the products of the chase . He never , in his native state , rears cattle , domesticates animals ( except the dog ) , cultivates the soil for any kind of food-crop , builds permanent dwellings , manufactures clothing , nor wears anything on his body except a hip girdle , necklaces of animal teeth , and similar adornments ( nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he puts on skins or matting . ' The Australians dwell for the most part in rude huts or wurleys , made of grass-tree , or occasionally of paper-bark . These are made by the women . In some districts more permanent structures are erected , built of logs of wood and thatching plastered with clay , and erected on a // wooden frame . Circular stone erections are said to have been used in North-West Australia . The large huts are intended for more than one family , or for the unmarried men and youths . The Australian is an able and sagacious hunter , and , unlike the Tasmanian , he is also a fisherman . The famous boomerang is a deadly weapon in the skilful hands of the native , and in West Australia fish are even procured by a special fish boomerang . Besides this , clubs with various shaped heads and stone-headed spears are in use throughout the century . The women are usually provided with a digging-stick which is sometimes used for defensive purposes . In hunting animals the Australian Flack usually follows his prey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he runs , when it stops he st ups , and so on , till at last the man proves sturdier Ilan the beast ( usually a kangaroo ) . This method .. I ' catching kangaroos requires a hunter of exceptional endurance to bring it to a successful issue , and is therefore less frequently adopted than hunting with dogs or securing the prey in nets . Ennis , being powerful birds and fleet of foot , are not easily captured . The native usually watches the tracks near a waterhole . When the birds come down the hunters set up an immense net behind them , or else drive them into pits dug near the heeding grounds . Ducks are often taken by stretching a net across a river , although they are also // stalked , speared , or snared by nooses set in the swamps . Fish are procured by the simple method of the native walking into the water and catching the fish with his feet . Big reptiles , such as the turtle , are captured with the aid of a sucker fish . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ string to its tail and putting it overboard to serve as a means of securing his prey . Thus he is enabled to aim correctly his harpoon . In some parts bone or shell hooks with worms , shrimps , and crabs as bait are used . In New South Wales fishing with hook and line is the special province of the women . To catch water-fowl the blackfellow will swim under water and pull the bird down . In like manner , to procure a meal of pigeon . or cockatoo , he gets into a tree at night and lashes out , with a stick at the birds as they fly past . Opossum hunting is a most sportsmanlike pursuit in South Australia , where the animal abounds . The hunter carefully examines the trunks of the trees in the forest , to see whether there are any recent , marks of opossum 's claws upon them . The trained eye can at once tell by the scratches if the animal 's last move was up or down the tree . If the former be the case , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , or he climbs the tree , cuts a hole in the trunk where he believes him to be concealed , and pulls him out ! // The flesh of animals and fish is usually cooked . Occasionally , if the native is very hungry after a long chase , he will eat his prey raw , or , in the case of a fish , just fling it on the fire and eat it almost immediately . But when not so ravenous he cleans his fish , and plucks and draws his birds , cooking them on hot ashes , and serving them on a dish of bark in a most appetising manner . Before leaving the subject of the food quest we must refer to the practice of cannibalism . Except as part of a religious ceremony , or on very rare occasions , human flesh is not eaten . The Australian aborigines are not cannibals . Usually the revolting practice is only resorted to in order to acquire the strength of a dead man , or to establish a vital union with the dead . Enemies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should a man in the Turribul tribes be killed in the ceremonial combats that follow initiation ceremonies , portions of the flesh are eaten as a sacred meal . As regards vegetable food , yams and similar roots are dug up by the women and eaten raw or roasted . Seeds are collected and ground between two stones , and often baked into cakes . Nuts are rousted in the fire , after having been soaked in water for a considerable time . Grubs are also eaten , sometimes raw , sometimes cooked . Ants ' s are also a favourite article of food . The black // tracks down bees to their hives in trees , cuts out the nest ( the bees being stingless ) , and extracts the honey . ' Notwithstanding the fact that primitive people are usually skilful hunters , as has been shown above  --  there is no tribe in Australia unable to secure food by natural means yet supernatural or magical influence is invariably brought to bear on the chase . This has been illustrated , as regards Palaeolithic man , by the Aurignacian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , all the animals represented are such as are desirable for food , 2 although his second statement , that " undesirable animals " are not depicted , is not correct , since a lion , a bear , and a wolf have been found on the wall of Combarelles , and a wolf at Font de Gaume . It by no means follows , however , that these animals were not eaten by Palaeolithic man . Nevertheless , there seems little doubt that the metaphorical magic of the artist 's pencil had once a literal meaning . Mr. F. H. Cushing describes the images of their totems carved out of stone by the Zuni Indians , with a flint arrow bound to the fetish . " This apparently corresponds to the arrows painted on the side of the bison at Fontde-Gaume . The image is set apart for magical // purposes at the New Year Festival . Every hunter carries the fetish with him in the chase . Likewise among the Ojibwa Indians the medicine man makes a drawing of the animal to be hunted and paints the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth , along which the image passes at his incantation ) . Again , the paintings of the Bushmen recall the mural decorations of the French and Spanish caves , and these we know were for sympathetic magic , rather than for aesthetic purposes.2 In the sandstone caves of the Natal Down ( Australia ) the Pegulloburra tribe make drawings of emu and kangaroo , and incidents of the chase , together with impressions of the hand daubed with red.3 From an artistic point of view these sketches are inferior to those of Palaeolithic man , and obviously belong to a different school from the Aurignacian , but , nevertheless , judging from similar decorations on Churinga or sacred amulets , weapons and various other objects used in sacred ceremonies , t hey must be magico-religious in intent . Here is an actual case of Palaeolithic customs I i n g practised by primitive man of to-day . These designs are therefore interesting , not only because they represent another aspect of the food quest , // but also because they show a real connexion between the manners , customs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus is justified the anthropological principle of determining the manner of life of the earliest human inhabitants of the earth , by an investigation of the rites and customs of surviving primitive people . The brief description of Australian culture given above will doubtless suggest to the archaeologist many Palaeolithic parallels . The aborigines , like Palaeolithic man , are hunters and flint-workers , they are unacquainted with agriculture , the domestication of animals , the erection of permanent dwellings , and yet the same artistic concept found among the men of the later Palaeolithic epoch is set forth in their caves and on their rocks . Is it too much to suppose that Palaeolithic man also performed Intiehiuma ceremonies , whereby the Arunta and other Australian tribes increase the supply of the particular totem , animal , or plant by sacred rites ? Messrs . Spencer and Gillen , the well-known anthropological investigators of the tribes of Central and Northern Australia , have described what took place at the Inticliiuma ceremonies in connexion with the witchetty grub totem at Alice Springs , in the Arunta country . The men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a given day proceed , late in the afternoon , to Emily Gap , a i // place especially associated with the Alcheringa ancestors of the group . On its walls are the sacred drawings characteristic of the totem , a fact that suggests a totemic significance for some of the Palaeolithic paintings . The Alatunja , or leader of the ceremonies , carries a small bark food vessel ( called a pitchi , or , in this particular case , an apmara ) and the rest of the party have in their hands little twigs of the Udniringa bush , on which the totem feeds . When the party reach a spot known as Ilthura oknira , placed high up on the western wall of the gap , they gather round a shallow cave , in which there is a large block of quartzite , surrounded by several small stones . The big stone represents the adult animal , the little stones being the eggs . First the leader taps the big stone with the twigs Ile carries in his hand , and invites it to lay eggs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one of the smaller stones , saying " You have eaten much food . " After visiting some ten of these spots , and repeating the same ceremony at each , the party returns to the camp and holds sacred ceremonies in the wurley erected for the purpose . Other ceremonies of a similar character are // performed in the autumn , but since their purpose is to effect a union of a sacramental character with the sacred species rather than to secure a supply of the totem , their description will be reserved for the next chapter . In the rites we are now considering there are several important links with prehistoric times , of which the drawings on the walls at Emily ( lap and the use of red ochre may be quoted as examples . This evidence is supported by the fact that the Intichiuma ceremonies are closely connected with the magical control of the food supply , which has also given rise to cave paintings among the Bushmen and the Indians of America. , analogous to those of the Magdalenians . Now , if we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rites of the Australians we do not suggest that they were in any way identical were performed by man at the end of the Palaeolithic epoch , then another conclusion of no small importance naturally follows . The Intichiuma rites are the outcome , on the social side , of the totemic organization of society . Among primitive people a certain relation is assumed between man and animals and plants , and occasionally an inanimate object such as wind , rain , a stone , etc . Very often this kinship is supposed to be due to the original groups having arisen out of animals and plants . In Australia the Inapertwa // ( rudimentary men ) are regarded as a stage in the course of transformation of complete men and women from lizards , rats , parakeets , emus , hakea trees , etc . Naturally when the groups were eventually formed they were intimately associated with the animals and plants out of which they were evolved , the particular object becoming the totem . It is not unreasonable to suppose that some of the Palaeolithic paintings and carvings have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystic signs found on the painted pebbles at Mas d'Azil , which bear a certain resemblance to the Australian totemic designs . Again , according to Dr. Marett , the curious arabesques , made by the fingers in the gluey clay of the walls and roof of the cave at Gargas , are imitations of the scratches left by the cave-bear  --  the totem of these particular Aurignacians.l Taken collectively and in conjunction with the fact that the primeval inhabitants of Europe , like the Australians , depended on the chase for their food supply , the evidence suggests the probability of the existence of totemism in the Palaeolithic age . There are three important features of the relation between human beings and their totems . ( I ) The totem is connected with a definite social group , and in the typical form of the institution this social division is exogamous ( i.e. the law of // marrying out of the totem group ) . Often the group makes the name and the badge of the totem its own . ( 2 ) The members of the totemic group believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and often think they are descended from it . ( 3 ) There is a mystic bond between the totem and the totemite which is of a sacramental nature . The result of this is that the totem tends to consolidate a group of individuals , having a common relationship being all " one flesh " with the sacrosanct animal into a distinct social unit . These totem groups are comparatively small , and form sub-divisions of the phratries or moieties into which the tribe is iii the first place divided . In Australia the phratries are again divided into classes , either four or eight in number . This is a special variety of he exogamous system in which a person has not only to marry outside his own class , but also into a specified group . The totemkins are cross-divisions with the classes . There seems to be no limit to the number of totem groups which may exist in a tribe , but the same group is seldom found in the two phratries . The relationship between the totem and the totemite makes the members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they act together on all occasions , and an injury wrought by any one of them may be avenged on any other , so close is their relationship . // Closely associated with the totemic organization of society is the practice of exogamy . This custom forces men and women to contract unions with the members of distinct food-groups , a practice not without economic advantage among people in a hunting stage of society . Thus , supposing the Cockatoo and Crow people are food-groups of the same totem-kin , all the members of each group are brethren because they are " one flesh . " These are , we suppose , exogamous , and , therefore , Cockatoo men must marry Crow girls . To borrow further from Dr. Marett 's excellent example , l let us imagine that the groups are separated by a river . After marriage the Cockatoos and Crows each abide on their own side of the river , where they are visited by their partners from across the water , who naturally are regarded more or less as outsiders , notwithstanding the fact that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cockatoo and Crow quarters respectively as little Cockatoos and Crows . Any correction that is found to be necessary in the upbringing of the young Cockatoo is exercised by the Cockatoos and not by the Crows though the father be a Crow . As the child grows to manhood he shares in the Cockatoo toils and spoils of the chase , inherits the weapons and other property of his group , and is initiated into their totemic // mysteries . In the event of the Crows entering into deadly conflict with the Cockatoos , the youth has to fight for the latter against his father 's people . It is therefore evident that where the wife stays with her group  --  a system technically known as matrilocal marriage  --  the life and interest of the children is wholly bound up with the mother 's , totem-kin , and , in consequence , descent is usually reckoned matrilineally . When matrilineal , matrilocal , and matripotestal ( supreme authority exercised over the children by the mother and her group ) conditions are found together , we have mother-right at its fullest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wherever a totemic basis of society prevails mother-right is found , although where there is an evolution it ; invariably happens that the development is from mother-right to father-right . The simplest organization is represented by the Urabunna and Dieri tribes of Australia , where dual organization , the system of marrying across , prevails . Among the Dieri the totem-kins are found in the phratry , but ; it is so arranged that no kin exists in both phratries , and marriage is regulated simply by the rule of exogamy . Among the Urabunna , one totem-kin may not intermarry with any and every totem-kin of the opposite phratry , but each is limited to one kin . Thus , Wild Ducks are only allowed to marry Carpet Snakes , the children taking the name of their mother 's totem // ( i.e. matrilineal descent ) . A similar dual organization is found in Melanesia . ) The Kariera tribe on the north-west coast of Australia is divided into four classes  --  Banaka , Burung , Karimera , and Palyeri.2 A Banaka man may only marry a Burung woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Burung man and a Banaka woman will be Karimera . The system may thus be described graphically : figure It will be observed that man and wife must belong to opposite phratries , and that " descent follows the distaff " ; the children belong to the same phratry , though not to the same class , as their mother . These examples suffice to show that the totem-kin is the social unit with the tribe  --  the political unit of the inter-marrying groups . Occasionally an inter-tribal gathering takes place , as for example , for the purpose of holding initiation ceremonies , but this is a more or less rare occurrence . First a man belongs to the phratry , which is divided into two , four , or eight exogamous classes . But he also has a narrower relationship , that of the individual family . It has been asserted by many anthropologists in // the past , of whom Morgan , Bachofen , MacLennon , and Lubbock may be taken as examples , that primeval society consisted of an undivided commune in which marriage was unknown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the fact that it supported the theories of primitive common property and of economic determinism of the Marxian school of socialists . Almost the only positive evidence in its favour is the fragmentary testimony of some ancient classical writers such as Herodotus and Strabo , but even if the examples quoted refer to promiscuity , they are too few to justify the conclusion that all peoples lived originally in the conditions which they describe . As to the indirect evidence in favour of the theory , consisting of inferences from such customs as matrilineal descent , religious prostitution , unrestrained sexual intercourse before marriage , and primitive community of property  - -  every one of these conditions can be explained more easily on other grounds than on the assumption of promiscuity . The attitude of recent authorities to the theory is thus set forth by Howard : " The researches of several recent writers , notably those of Starcke and Westermarck , confirming in part and further developing the earlier conclusions of Darwin and Spencer , have established a probability that marriage , or pairing between one man and one woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule frequently violated , is the typical form of sexual union from the infancy of the human race . " 1 Morgan , who is largely responsible for the promulgation of the doctrine of primitive promiscuity , first studied the Iroquois , and , no doubt , thoroughly digested their social organization . He subsequently put Fison on to collect similar facts in Fiji . This latter investigator afterwards went to Australia , where he met Howitt . It is , therefore , easily explained why Howitt is inclined to find group marriage everywhere in the South-East district , since he had been indirectly ( through Mr. Fison ) brought under the influence of Morgan . Dr. Frazer , in his Totemism and Exogamy , adopts much the same lines as Morgan . There are four main arguments put forth in favour of communal marriage : ( 1 ) The Classificatory System . Because the savage calls all men father it is argued that he has no conception of individual paternity . But it should be remembered that he also calls all women mother . It is surely contrary to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know her own child as distinct from other children , and that the child regards all women as its mother . Again , it is said , the matrimonial class does not deli actual marriage but marriageability . That is to say , // it defines a group in which a selection of partners may be made according to choice . But the mere fact that the class system shows a man where to look for a wife , presupposes the existence of individual marriage . The classificatory system is based on exogamy . The question , " Why do people marry out ? " necessitates by way of answer , the definition of marriageability. ( 2 ) Supplementary Unions .  --  According to Gasonl the Dieri girls are betrothed to one man in infancy , who in due course becomes her Tippa - malku husband . This is an individual relationship , since no woman can be Tippa-malku to two or more men at the same time . In. due course certain supplementary unions are sanctioned by the council of old men . This is called the Pirrauru relationship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women have the right of sexual intercourse with one another . But a Pirrauru is al ways a wife 's sister , or a brother 's wife , or in some such definite relationship to her partner . Therefore the system is merely an extension of conjugal rights within what the savage regards as the " family circle . " Furthermore , the relationship is only supplementary . When a man goes on a journey the Piraungaru husband steps in his place ; or , if a visitor , being of the proper class , calls upon a friend , the host may offer him his // Tippa-malku as a temporary Pirrauru , provided he is Noa ( i.e. in the relation of spouseship " ) to her . Therefore this system , though regrettably loose , does not constitute promiscuity , but rather represents an extreme degree of private ownership . In like manner , the sexual relations between groups of men formed by the husband 's brothers and the group of women formed by the wife 's sisters in Melanesia are but the extension of marital rights to members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Defloration.  --  Among all the tribes examined by Spencer and Gillen ritual defloration is practised on the girl by men standing to her in a definite relationship , as a marriage ceremony connected with the handing over of the girl to her allotted husband.2 There is , however , no reason to suppose that this is a survival of primitive promiscuity . It is rather , as will subsequently be shown , a religious ceremony  --  a " rite de passage safeguarding the dangers to which individuals are subjected at any transition from one period of life to another . ( 4 ) Ceremonial License .  --  Besides ritual defloration and the Pirrauru relationship , considerable license is allowed on certain occasions when large numbers of men and women are gathered together to perform corrobborees . At such times conven- // tional restrictions such as class rules are broken down , but blood ties are respected . A man may have , in connexion with certain ceremonies , access to his mother-in-law , who under normal conditions is strictly tabu to him , but under no circumstances can there be any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( actual father , brother and sons of a woman ) . Therefore it may be concluded that on all occasions when ceremonial license takes place , the strict class exogamy does not hold good , but incest as regards blood relationship is always strictly forbidden , and consequently a state of real promiscuity does not exist . Enough has been said to show that there is good reason to suppose that primeval society was not an undivided commune in which " there is no marriage . " If our surmise is correct , that Palaeolithic society was ordered on a totemic basis , the theory of primitive promiscuity absolutely falls to the ground . We are therefore of the opinion that from the earliest days of man 's pilgrimage on the earth there was marriage and giving in marriage , if by marriage is meant " a union regulated by custom and law . " ' The tribe has yet to be found in which unions are not regulated by custom and law . Dr. Malinowski , in his Family among the Australian Aborigines , has clearly proved the // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modern representatives of Palaeolithic man . He quotes forty-nine instances of the way wives are obtained by the natives , most of which are of a specific nature . ' The simplest , and therefore perhaps the commonest , method of procedure is to exchange a sister for a wife . Betrothal often takes place at or even before birth , showing ipso facto how deeply rooted is the idea of the individual right of a man to a woman in the primitive mind . Even in elopements there are certain rites and formalities that have to be observed , as , for instance , the magic sleep into which the parents are cast and the hasty retreat of the lovers to a convenient distance from the camp ere the irate parents awake . Marriage by capture is not unknown ; but Mr. Curr is probably correct in saying that this method is more or less rare , as it would lead to constant attacks from the tribe from which the woman was stolen.2 The elaborate system of phratry organization described above greatly restricts a man in the choice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sisters is prevented , though the object of the system originally was probably to prevent marriage between people of different generations not related by blood . In the Arunta there is , unlike most Australian tribes , // no restriction whatever , as far as totems are concerned . In several of the Central tribes the totemkin is found in both phratries , and tends to coincide with the local groups . Although methods of securing wives in the Arunta district include the magic use of love-charms to entice a girl to her lover , and also capture and elopement , it is the custom of Tualcha-Mora that is the most useful method of obtaining a wife . An arrangement is made between two men that the relationship shall be established between their two children , one a boy and the other a girl , both of tender years . They are then taken to the women 's camp where each mother rubs the other child all over with a mixture of fat and ochre in the presence of all the other women . Some of the girl 's hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that when grown . up it will be her duty to provide him ( her son-in-law as he will be ) with her own hair from which to make him a waist-girdle . The girl must be Mura to the boy , that is , one whose daughters belong to the class from which his wife must come . By this ceremony she becomes Tualchamura , i.e. his actual or prospective mother-in-law . This relationship indicates that the man has the right to take the daughter of the woman ; she is , in fact , assigned to him , and this , as a general rule , many years before she is born.l // Enough has been said to show that if the Australians can be taken as an example of a really primitive community , there is no reason to suppose that primeval society consisted of an undivided commune . The martial relations of the tribes fall under three headings . The first is the normal one , when the woman is the wife of one man ; and no one , without his consent , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation in regard to particular men at the time of marriage . The third is the still wider relation which obtains on certain occasions , such as the holding of important corrobborees . It must not be forgotten , however , that licentious as is the last named relationship , it is the exception rather than the rule . Under ordinary circumstances , for a man to have intercourse with a woman who is not his lawful wife is a very grave offence , and liable to punishment by death . Furthermore , except in those tribes in which the Pirrauru relationship exists , the system of individual wives prevails , modified as indicated above . Among all the tribes described by Messrs . Spencer and Gillen , there seem to be some marriage rites . The ceremonies usually consist of ritual decoration by men standing in a definite relationship to the girl , followed by intercourse and decoration of the head and body with a mixture of fat and ochre . This is undoubtedly the crudest form of marriage // known , and yet it is a definite social and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the case of marriage brought about by magically attracting a woman from one camp to another , the act of union appears to effect a kind of sacramental alliance . If St. Paul considers that casual intercourse with a harlot produces a permanent union between man and woman ( 1 Cor vi . 16 ) , how much more should the merging of two lives into one by marital relations be considered a valid marriage effecting a permanent alliance . We therefore conclude , judging from the Australian evidence , that marriage is the socio-religious act by which , from the earliest times , the natural inclinations of man for woman and vice versa are satisfied in a lawful manner , and that the principle of monogamy has prevailed from the beginning . In confirmation of this view it may be pointed out that the ceremonies connected with marriage in primitive society invariably refer to the union of the two individuals and not to groups . There can be little doubt but that the joining of hands , the placing of feathers , the exchange of fire-sticks , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sacramental marriage between two persons . It would be contrary to the evolutionary principle by which the world his governed , to find a perfect monogamous system in vogue in primitive society , // though the principle of monogamy is certainly discernible even in the Australian marital relations . In the full sense of the term the wife has only one husband , since the first husband enjoys conjugal rights superior to men who are in a totemic sense " one flesh " with the woman . In the case of supplementary unions the very fact that the husband 's consent has to be obtained proves that a woman only has one proper husband , and that individual marriage exists though slightly modified . The greater number of polyandrous unions ( the union of several husbands with one wife ) are in Australia of the fraternal kind , and therefore the custom is softened in the direction of monogamy , since the wife belongs to a group of men united by the closest ties of blood . Again , the right of access to a woman exercised at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " danger " attached to the sacredness of sexual intercourse , rather than a survival of primeval promiscuity . As regards polygamy , it is almost unknown in the most primitive society , because hunting and fishing are the chief means of livelihood , and female labour has not the value that attaches to it when a man 's wives can be employed in tending flocks , cultivating the fields , and performing handicrafts . As wealth increases the practice becomes more general , ' // till , in a higher stage of culture still , it tends to give way to monogamy . There is yet another reason for deciding against the theory of primitive promiscuity . It is not too much to say that the institution of marriage is founded on the requirements of man 's nature . In all stages of culture it has been found that it is not good for man to be alone . As a mere individual he can hardly exist , and certainly can not fulfil his purpose in the world . Man is , in the words of Aristotle , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is necessary for him to live the fulness of his life , and therefore marriage is not an artificial regulation of civilized society , but a natural necessity in all ages of man 's terrestrial history . Were the human species constituted as the lower animals , a merely passing union of the sexes would suffice ; but more than this is required . The offspring needs long continued care after birth . A parallel is , of course , to be found in some of the lower animals , but in a less degree . Child-bearing in the human organism continues for some time , while the elder children are growing to maturity , whereas in the other animals the young are usually independent of the mother before other offspring are born . The connexion of human parents is therefore indefinitely prolonged , extending beyond the age of child-bearing . As a consequence of this prolonged intimacy there appears the phenomenon I // of human love apart from sexual desire . In the same way the parental and filial affections of the human species pass the bounds of mere devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals , which terminates with the period of protection . Marriage , then , is the permanent connexion of man and woman , and as such it is natural in purpose , though religious and social in origin . It is sacred , being intended primarily to perpetuate life . Its secondary ends are the " mutual society , help and comfort that the one ought to have of the other both in prosperity and adversity , " as well as a lawful remedy of concupiscence . But if marriage is " the permanent living together of man and woman " in a natural relationship )  --  a statement in perfect accord with anthropological evidence as well as Christian tradition  --  it therefore follows that it is indissoluble . A momentary connexion suffices for the purposes of procreation , but the community spirit and the instincts of parentage and human love are all against a passing union of man and woman . " For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife , and they two shall be one flesh , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of culture . Our Lord revoked the dispensations granted in the Mosaic Law by assigning the origin of the union to the Divine // order of things and thus raised marriage to the dignity of a sacrament . This is again in accord with anthropological evidence , since marriage is founded on the requirements of man 's nature , and , granting that man 's nature was ordained by God , being natural it is Divinely ordered . Christ was content to describe the beginning of the institution in the language of the Book of Genesis , probably because this was the only origin known to the Jews to whom He was speaking . He asserts that the union is in one flesh . " And they twain shall be one flesh , so then they are no more twain but one flesh . " ( St. Mark x. 6-9 , St. Matt. xix. 4-6 . ) The result of such Divine joining is that man may not put it asunder . The Christian Church has therefore at all times upheld the sanctity of the marriage tie against the onslaught both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is the only natural form of marriage . It is therefore the system which the race has approved at all stages of its development . Westermarck has admirably summed up the whole situation by saying : " It is not , of course , impossible that , among some peoples , intercourse between the sexes may have been almost promiscuous . But there is not a shred of genuine evidence for the notion that promiscuity ever formed a general stage in the history of mankind . . . // Although polygamy occurs among most existing peoples , and polyandry among some , monogamy is by far the most common form of human marriage . It was so among the ancient peoples of whom we have any direct knowledge . Monogamy is the form which is generally recognised and permitted . The great majority of peoples are , as a rule , monogamous , and other forms of marriage are usually modified in a monogamous direction . We may without hesitation assert that , if mankind advances in the same direction as hitherto ; if , consequently , the causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin continue to operate with constantly growing force ; if , especially , altruism increases , and the feeling of love becomes more refined and more exclusively directed to one  --  the laws of monogamy can never be changed , but must be followed much more strictly than they are now . " 1 CHAPTER IV . THE RELIGION OF PRIMEVAL MAN . THE origin and evolution of religion runs on parallel lines with the origin and evolution of human society considered from a social and cultural standpoint . The precise origin of religion is a matter of considerable controversy . One school of anthropologists led by Sir James Frazer , who defines religion as " the propitiation of personal beings regarded as superior to man , " 1 maintains that an age of magic developed into an age of religion , the magician becoming the priest when " the fallacy of magic becomes more and more apparent to the acuter minds , and is slowly displaced by religion ; the magician renouncing the attempt to control directly the processes of nature for the good of man , seeking to attain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he no longer imagines he can do for himself . " 2 This theory , that originally man tried to control // nature by using what he conceived to be immutable laws till , in process of time , the method proved a failure , and in consequence primeval man came to believe in the existence of divine powers whom he could not control , is simply stated , but it is by no means so easily shown to account for the whole body of primitive rites and beliefs . According to this hypothesis the Australians are still in an " age of magic , " an assumption contradicted by the mere fact that they recognise a Supreme Being or AllFather who presides over their sacred ceremonies , and is such a " High " God that he has been found by missionaries a convenient means of presenting to the native mind some of the attributes of the Christian conception of the Deity . To justify the distinction between magic and religion , Frazer has been led to surround primitive man with all kinds of malignant spirits to account for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus he has fallen into the fundamental error of assuming stages in the evolution of magic and religion as clearly defined as those exhibited by the geological record of the earth . The more primitive cult is intensively studied the more apparent it becomes that magic and religion are so intermingled that the two aspects of " control " are found in the same rite . Even the medicine man in Australia is often initiated by the tribal god or by spirits , and , therefore , the // procedure is raised from the level of pure magic . This applies to most , if not to all , beneficent rites . The hypothesis that the human race has passed through a wholly non-religious era is therefore scarcely susceptible to historic proof . Dr. Marett 's view that in the primitive conception of the supernatural there was the germ of both magic and religion which tended to become differentiated seems to be far more tenable , in the light of actual fact . ' In the most primitive cult magic and religion are interfused . In process of development the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines of its own . Magic , as well as religion , seems to be a thing of gradual growth . At first it gathered round ideas connected with tabu  --  the Polynesian word used by anthropologists to describe religious or magical prohibitions . With the rise of animistic beliefs and practices the magician became associated with the spirits of the dead , of animals and of evil spirits , but this does not necessarily imply that the anthropomorphic deity , so prevalent in primitive cult to-day , was evolved from a primeval belief in a divine animal or plant . In Australia gods are neither spirits of the dead nor deified divine animals . They are simply Supreme Beings  --  magnified non-natural // men , often dwelling in the sky  --  who have never died . To obviate such difficulties as would arise from the adoption of the Frazerian " stratification " theory , we shall use in this chapter ( and elsewhere ) the expression magico-religious . This term stands for a working hypothesis . In Notes and Queries on Anthropology  --  the locus classicus of anthropological definitions  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion , about which the framers of general theory are in dispute , may be ignored for purposes of particular description , " the phrase magico-religious sufficing to cover all the facts relating to magical , religious , and quasimagico-religious rites , beliefs , and customs . ' Another school of anthropologists follow the late Sir Edward Tylor in seeking the origin of religion in " the belief in spiritual beings , " 2 that is to say , of " spirits " in the wide sense that includes souls . This theory asserts that the prototype of soul and spirit is to be sought especially in the " dream-double and " trance-double , " that " vaporous materiality , " as Dr. Tylor describes it , that is suggested by psychological experiences , such as dreams , trances , shadows , hallucinations , breath , sleep , death , etc . There is no doubt that the phantasm plays a considerable part in primitive religion . Savages have vivid // dreams , see ghosts , and are subject to hallucinations , and thus the phantasm is a connecting link between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by animism Tylor means not only the belief in spiritual beings but also " a general animation of nature . " Now there is no reason to suppose that primitive man attributes anything phantasmal to a running stream , a peculiar tree , or a heavenly body , yet he often regards such natural objects as sacred . Again , it is obvious that the Tylorian doctrine of animism can not account for all religious and magico-religious practices among primitive people . The anthropomorphic deity is not included in this hypothesis any more than in Frazer 's stratification theory . Primitive religion must be represented by something vaguer and wider , resembling more the conception set forth by the Melanesian word Mana , a generic name for the mystic influence which fills certain sacred things . " It is a power or influence , " says Codrington , " not physical , and in a way supernatural ; but it shows itself in physical force , or in any kind of power or excellency which a man possesses . This mama is not fixed in anything , and can be conveyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or supernatural beings , have it , and can impart it , and it essentially belongs to personal beings to originate it , though it may act through the medium // of water , or a stone or a bone . " 1 This wonderful supernatural power gives success in war , makes pigs multiply , gardens become productive , nets catch fish , and arrows inflict mortal wounds.2 The ultimate source of mana is in " personal beings . " Codrington includes living men in this category , but since mana is something supernatural , it must pre-eminently belong to supernatural personalities such as ghosts or spirits . From these it may be communicated to any animate or inanimate object . But although its ultimate source is in conceptions of spirit or ghost , in practice it covers all cases of magico-religious efficacy either automatic or proceeding from a spiritual being . ' Any startling manifestation of nature , a curiously shaped rock , animals of uncanny appearance , a dead body , a mighty chief , a rushing stream , etc. , is conceived as having mana , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things having about them this mysterious energy are regarded as sacred quite apart from their being the abode of a spiritual being . This force may be called " god , " as it is by the people of Madagascar . So , too , the Masai and Akikuyu conception of Deity is equally vague . Anything that is to them incomprehensible or peculiar is t // ngai ( god ) , ' just as among the Algonquin it is manitou , or orenda to the Iroquoian . Not dissimilar is the conception of mulungu among the Yaos , east of Lake Nyassa . This term signifies the " Great One " and is equivalent to god , although to the native mind it does not convey the notion of personality . It denotes rather an inherent supernatural energy associated with such mysterious objects as the rainbow , a sacred tree , etc . In Morocco the Arabs designate the mystic force connected with " holy " people and places as baraka . The term is also used to describe " sacredness " in general . Thus , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The conception of mana is , therefore , by no means confined to Melanesia . It is rather a worldwide aspect of primitive cult . Around it gather all the fundamental principles of savage religion . It is sufficiently vague to describe those early religious ideas before the conception of personality enters into the primeval consciousness , and yet it is also connected with a belief in spiritual and anthropomorphic beings . That this attitude of mind , called by Dr. Marett animatism , is psychologically an earlier phase than animism , is shown by the case of the Trojan offerings to a sacred river , // narrated by Homer . Originally the Trojans regarded the river as containing mana , and , in consequence , they sacrificed a bull to the stream . The animal was thrown into the water whole and entire . In later times , when they had reached an animistic stage , an altar was erected by the side of the river on which a bull was offered , the belief being that the spirit in the water came out and consumed the essence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that there was , in primeval days , a stratigraphical evolution from animatism to animism . As a matter of fact animatism , animism , and anthropomorphism constantly exist side by side , and therefore presumably they may be supposed to have arisen simultaneously as an explanation of many different phenomena . Animatism originally may have been applied to non-human objects , whereas animism may have arisen by way of explanation of such phenomena as dreams , hallucinations , trance , sickness , death , reflections in water , shadows , etc . On the other hand , anthropomorphism did not evolve out of animistic conceptions . In Australia All-Fathers are neither animistic nor even animatistic in character . They are conceived of as magnified non-natural men , often dwelling in the sky  --  supermen who have never died . The origin of these truly religious ideas may reasonably be sought in such awe-inspiring events as thunderstorms , // calculated to suggest the existence of an external supernatural being . This threefold origin of religious phenomena  --  animatism having reference to nonhuman objects containing mana , animism arising by way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anthropomorphism as the result of the spiritual and theistic yearnings of the human soul , seeking a supernatural Creator of nature outside the world  --  seem to us a possible and reasonable explanation of the magico-religious beliefs and customs , at any rate among modern people in a primitive state of culture . Before passing on to the consideration of the light thrown on the religion of primeval man by archaeological evidence , we must remind the reader that the primitive mind is incapable of abstraction , and , therefore , any search for an organized theology either in ancient or modern representatives of Palaeolithic man will be in vain . Certain things , animals , places , and persons are sacred because they are endowed with mana , and therefore they are hedged round with tabus , and rites have , in consequence , to be duly performed . The ritual acts in course of time become more and more elaborate , and mythology grows up to explain the ceremonies . But spiritual religion , as , practised in the higher systems , is unknown in primitive cult . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a routine of worship , except , perhaps , as regards certain aspects of the All-Father belief . // Nevertheless , primitive man is a distinctly religious person , and his ritual is not mere ceremony , since it is performed for the specific purpose of bringing him into contact with the supernatural or sacred world . Thus , primitive religion may be described as the attitude towards , perhaps the exploitation If the sacred , embodied in attempts to come into beneficial contact with it and appropriate to himself as much as possible of its transferable force by various ritual acts , while safe-guarding himself from its dangerous and excessive manifestations . These beliefs and practices lie at the root alike of religion and of magic ; they constitute the magico-religious attitude , out of which both magic and religion are to be differentiated . To define the special line of development which constitutes religion is not easy . From one point of view it might be said that the recognition of mana from without leads to religion , while the consciousness of mana from within leads to magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if only because man is always seeking to reinforce his own mana by the virtue of every sacred , mysterious , and wonderworking object which seems to him to possess it . In attempting to unravel , in some measure , the mystery of the religion of primeval man we shall work on the lines adopted in the last chapter , endeavouring to interpret the archaeological // evidence from the culture-remains of Pleistocene times , by the aid of the researches of anthropologists among the Australians and other primitive people living under conditions similar to those prevailing in Europe in the Palaeolithic epoch . Formerly it had been generally supposed that primeval man had no religion , because among the relics disinterred on the inhabited sites no materials were found which suggested funerary rites . But a fresh interpretation of the sepulchral phenomena associated with some of the skeletons from Palaeolithic sites leave little doubt that in those far-off days man realised that he was composed of two separate entities  --  body and soul the latter passing on to the world of spirits after somatic death . On August 3rd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aux Saints in which the skeleton lay on its back from east to west . Around it were a quantity of Mousterian flints , fragments of red ochre and broken bones , while over the head were several long bones lying flat , one of them still in connexion with some smaller bones of the foot and toes , so as to suggest that it was still clothed with flesh when it was placed in this position . This was evidently a ceremonial interment , accompanied by offerings of food and implements for the use of the deceased in the spirit world ) . // On March 7th , 1909 , another Palaeolithic interment was found in the rock-shelter of Le Moustier . The body  --  that of a youth about sixteen years of age  --  lay on its right side with the right arm bent so as to support the head on a pillow of flints , and the left arm extended . Within easy reach of the latter lay a magnificent oval-shaped implement , worked on both sides , and a little farther on a flint scraper . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remains of a funeral feast . Dr. Klaatsch , the expert who examined the interment , came to the conclusion that the individual to whom the skeleton belonged had been ceremonially buried . The fact that these interments with funeral rites have been so circumstantially carried out , suggests that they were founded on an already established cult of the dead . Furthermore , the placing of weapons , food offerings , etc. , in the grave can only be explained on the ground that they were so arranged for the use of the soul in the spirit world . If it can be proved that the interment at Galley Hill is really of early Palaeolithic antiquity , it will then be shown that man , at the very beginning of the Pleistocene period practised rites which point to his having a somewhat definite conception of a life after death . The skeletons found in the Aurignacian Caves at Mentone supply additional evidence for the assumption that funeral rites were practised in the // Palaeolithic age . Here , again , implements and red ochre were buried with the bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearth , in others in a grave or rudimentary tomb , made by placing flat stones on edge for the wall , and roofing it over with larger slabs . The skeletons , all of which show Cro-Magnon features , were adorned with a necklace made of the teeth of deer , vertebrae of fish and carved pendants . No doubt these adornments were part of the burial rites . The Magdalenian remains found at Laugine-Basse and the Azilian site at Ofnet show that similar customs were in use at the close of the Palaeolithic age . At Ofnet twenty-seven skulls were orientated in the same direction , looking towards the setting sun . When these prehistoric interments are compared with the funeral rites of the Bushmen , the conclusion that Palaeolithic man believed in a life after death is placed beyond doubt . Among these primitive people the body of the deceased is painted with red ochre and grease , and buried facing the east . His bow and arrow '  --  - corresponding to the flint implements found in Palaeolithic interments  - -  is laid by his side . In Neolithic times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen middens of Mugem , in Spain , no less than a hundred interments were found at different levels in the // shell mounds , although grave-furniture does not appear to have been associated with them . In later Neolithic times the Megalithic culture grew up , as an outcome of simple inhumation ( i.e. placing a body in a hole in the earth , and covering it over with soil ) . : In this very early form of burial the spot was rked by an earth mound or by stones . ' Subsequently the grave was lined with stones over which a large capstone was placed by way of protection . Thus came into being the cist , the most widely distributed type of early grave known . From this to the megalithic monument , with its separate chambers , entrance passage , and cairn , was an easy transition . But the erection of the elaborately constructed chambered cairn was not merely a matter of respect for the deceased . The general view of archaeologists is that the grave was regarded as the temporary abode of the soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it constituted an intermediate state between earth and the spirit-world . From very early times fire was looked upon as a purifying agent ( which probably accounts for the numerous partially burnt bodies found in graves long before cremation was generally adopted ) , and therefore in due course cremation became a religious cult , // since the practice was thought not only to purify the soul but also to speedily set it free from its fleshy entanglement . The Long Barrows of the North of England show that an elaborate system of cremation was adopted in Yorkshire and Westmoreland , while in Wiltshire and Gloucestershire unburnt burials prevail . In the Bronze Age both burnt and unburnt remains are found in barrows that are circular and more or less conical ; an instance may be quoted in which the circumstances show that both methods were resorted to on occasions ; as , for example , in a mound excavated in 1849 on Acklam Wold , Yorkshire . In it were found a pile of burnt bones in close contact with the legs of a skeleton buried in the usual contracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot , for the knees of the skeleton were completely charred . It has been suggested that in cases like this , or where an unburnt body is surrounded by a ring of urn-burials , the entire skeletons may be those of chiefs or heads of families , and the burnt bones those of slaves , dependants , or even wives , sacrificed at the funeral . l When the corpse was burnt the ashes were carefully collected in an urn and buried , either in the earth or in a prepared grave . Sometimes the incinerated remains were laid in heaps in a barrow // or other sacred place . Cremation led to a considerable reduction in the size of the grave , since the body was reduced to a few ashes , and thus megalithic chambers may have given place to stone-lined cists . The large chambered cairns in Britain were generally the burial places of the earlier dolichocephalic race , except in the Yorkshire barrows where this race was mixed with the later brachycephals . The barrows of the earlier part of the Neolithic period are usually known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them from the " round barrows , " which belong to a succeeding time , although no hard and fast rule can be laid down as to the chronological sequence of earth mounds . These elongated graves are commonest in Wiltshire , Dorsetshire , Somersetshire , and Gloucestershire . A few exist elsewhere , but they are by no means of such frequent occurrence in Britain as those of circular shape . Some contain no chamber , while others contain a structure of the megalithic type . There is , however , one common feature in all long harrows wherever they are found , viz. , that no traces of metal , with possibly the exception of gold , have ever been discovered in them . There is also a similarity of burial custom , but the skulls clearly show that this does not prove identity of race , as was formerly supposed . Also in the succeeding round barrows metal seldom occurs , and // when it is found , the type always indicates the earliest phases of the Bronze Age . Moreover , the pottery of the barrows belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vast majority of the barrows must be assigned to the Stone Age . Chambered long barrows are most frequent in the neighbourhood of Wiltshire . The megalithic chambers within the mound are of three types . In the first there is the central gallery entering the mound and leading to a chamber or chambers formed of large slabs set on edge . The roof is made by laying large slabs across the tops of the sides . When there is no central corridor , the chambers are so arranged as to open outwards on the edge of the mound . Where the chamber is not connected with the outside , the barrow is composed of a series of cists or small dolmens within the mound . A megalithic monument may therefore be described as a building made of large stones , or , in some cases , a single rough stone pillar ( called a menhir ) with its base fixed into the ground . Megaliths for the most part belong to the Neolithic period and part of the Copper and Bronze Ages , although their exact age , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been definitely settled . Until recently megalithic remains were thought to be burial places of mighty chiefs , or temples used by the Druids . Numerous I // legends have collected round these monuments ; thus , for example , the Penrith circle is known by the local peasants as " Meg and her daughters , " and a dolmen in Berkshire near the " white horse " is called " Wayland Smith 's Cave , " while the menhir in the Orkney Isles is termed " Odin 's Stone . " Dolmens ( megaliths consisting of two or more upright stones standing a short distance apart , supporting a roofing stone , called a capstone ) are usually regarded as houses of dwarfs , caves of fairies , or forges of the devil , while menhirs are the arrows and cromlechs ( stone circles ) the cauldrons of his satanic majesty . Megaliths are sometimes associated with saints in France , and King Arthur in England . The circle at Penrith , according to one legend , is the rot ad table of the latter , and a dolmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allees couvertes ( or long rectangular gallery leading to or taking the place of a chamber ) of Arles are called shops of the Saracens , and dolmens in India are often thought to be stones of the monkeys . Even to this day megaliths are looked upon by the credulous as sacred , and therefore dangerous . Peasants in France will not shelter under them , nor go near them at night . A dolmen at Finistere is said to cure rheumatism in anyone who rubs against the loftiest of its stones , and another heals fever patients who sleep under it . Oaths sworn near a megalith in Scotland are // supposed to have a peculiar sanctity . On the Berkshire Downs when a horse casts a shoe near " Wayland Smith 's Cave " the rider must leave it before the dolmen , placing a coin on the capstone . He then withdraws . On his returning to the spot he finds the horse shod and the money gone ! 1 In 1898 the British Association investigated " stone circles " with a view to ascertaining their age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Derbyshire ) with the result that the erection was assigned to the Neolithic period . Dr. Gowland shortly afterwards carried out investigations at Stonehenge , and , in a paper before the Society of Antiquaries on his recent excavations , came to the conclusion that the structure was a temple dedicated to the worship of the sun , and assigned its erection to the end of the Neolithic period on the ground that no traces of metal implements were found during his explorations ( Dec. 19 , 1901. ) 2 It does not necessarily follow , however , from the fact that only flint implements were discovered in association with the monolith examined that the monument was erected prior to the Metal Age , as Neolithic implements of the type found at Stonehenge ( mostly axes ) survived long into the Bronze Age . The archaeological evidence suggesting a late Neolithic antiquity to // the megalith is strengthened by the astronomical experiments carried out by Sir Norman Lockyer , which try to prove that on Midsummer Day , 1680 B.C. , the sun would rise over the summit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 This theory has been severely criticised by Mr. Hinks , who points out that the direction chosen for the avenue leading up to the Friar 's Heel is purely arbitrary , since the bench-mark he fixed on Sidbury Hill has no connexion with Stonehenge.2 Although the dating of monuments on the evidence of " observation lines " for determining certain movements of the sun involves much conjecture lacking in proof , yet , taken in conjunction with the more definite archaeological data , it is not to be despised , since there can be little doubt that the megalithic builders were influenced by a solar cult . What the nature of the worship carried on in megaliths was it is quite impossible to determine , but that they were temples dedicated to the sun or to other of the heavenly bodies seems to be highly probable . The frequency with which menhirs occur in a north-easterly direction suggests the catching of solar phenomena.3 We therefore conclude that Stonehenge , like most other megalithic monuments , was erected // at the end of the Neolithic or possibly at the very beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a temple dedicated to the sun . The occurrence of a stain of copper oxide on a worked block of stone at a depth of seven feet does not necessarily suggest the presence of bronze , as the stain may have been caused by the disintegration of malachite and not of metallic copper . It is most unlikely that such quantities of flint implements and no bronze or copper tools should be found if the remains were erected in the Bronze Age . As England is the home of the stone circle or cromlech , so France is the home of the dolmen . Some of the latter we have seen were covered under a mound of earth , thus forming chambered barrows . Exactly how the capstone was put into position is not known , it being not infrequently of great weight . That at Ballymascanlan , County Louth , for instance , weighs as much as sixty tons . The Egyptian monuments furnish us with an indication of the methods adopted in moving large stones to the required spot . The pictures at the tomb of Tahutihotep at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough road of beams is represented as laid in the required direction , on which rollers are placed under the stone . Ropes are attached to the rollers , and oxen , with the assistance of men , drag the stone along . In the seventeenth century the castle of Osaka in Japan // was erected on megalithic lines , by dragging huge stones ( one of which weighed 160 tons ) on rude wooden rollers . Another method is suggested by Peet . A gentle slope is erected on to which the stone is gradually hoisted by means of levers resting on beams or stones as fulchra , while other men fill up the space beneath it with earth and stones . This process is repeated till the stone is level with the top of the slope of hard earth covered with wet clay . On to this it is then slipped , and allowed to slide down the inclined plain . A fresh slope is then built , and the whole procedure repeated . The upright stones could then be placed in position by ropes and levers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uprights , along which the slab could be moved by rollers . This ingenious suggestion seems to be reasonable and probable . The size of dolmens varies considerably , ranging from the simplest form , as represented by the wellknown example at Kits ' Coty House between Maidstone and Rochester in Kent , which consists of three upright stones supporting a capstone 11 feet by 8 feet , to the huge structures known as Giant 's Graves or Allee Couvertes . La Roche aux Fees near Esse , may be taken as an example of an Allee Couverte . It consists of no less than thirty supports , covered by eight capstones . Another . // monument about the same length is the Dolmen of Bagneux , near the town of Saumur , which is constructed of huge flagstones  --  four in number on each side and four capstones . No less than 4000 dolmens are to be found in France , of which 618 are in Brittany . They are fairly abundant in North Germany , Spain , and through Portugal to Andalusia ; in Denmark and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by way of the Channel Islands  - -  Jersey contains several examples , and Guernsey is even more prolific . In the British Isles dolmens are more common in the west country  --  Cornwall , Wales , the Isle of Man , Ireland and Scotland . Sepulchral remains do not exist in Central Europe , but reappear in North Africa from Tripoli to Morocco , passing Eastwards through Persia , Syria and Palestine to India , Australia , Polynesia , Madagascar , Peru , etc . The manner of distribution of this type of megalithic monument has led to the theory of the existence of a migratory race known as " the People of the Dolmens , " moving from Scandinavia in a southerly direction to Africa . Others would reverse the direction , while Mr. Leeds of Oxford . finds the original home of the dolmen culture in France . For some years Professor G. Elliot Smith has been trying to show that the distribution of these // megalithic monuments can be reduced to a single origin . A study of mummification in Tones Straits suggested a marked resemblance to the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other indications he concludes that migrations which carried eastwards megaliths , mummification and the allied customs ( circumcision , incision , tattooing ) artificial deformation , the boomerang , the couvade , the deluge myth , and serpentworship , called collectively the " Heliolithic " 1 culture-complex ) set out from Egypt about 800 B.C. in pursuit of wealth . He cites evidence from several writers that about this time India and China were in a state of development , which he attributes to migrations from Egypt . By the year 900 B.C. he thinks that practically the whole complex structure had become built up and definitely conventionalized in the country , with numerous purely accidental additions from neighbouring lands . The great migration of the heliolithic culture , according to this theory , began shortly before 800 B.C. and is ascribed to the Phoenicians . Up to 800 B.C. these interesting people had , it is implied , limited their wanderings to the Mediterranean , the Red Sea , the Persian Gulf , and India . After receiving from Egypt the art of erecting megaliths and some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to East and West Africa , and along the coast-lands of Asia to India , China , Japan , the Pacific , and to America . The culture reached the Persian Gulf strongly tainted with the influence of North Syria and Asia Minor , and by the time it reached the West Coast of India and Ceylon ( about the eighth century B.C. ) it had taken over Mediterranean , Anatolian and ; Babylonian accretions , with East African modifications . These Ethiopian influences became more pronounced in Indonesia , because in India and the west the disturbances created by other cults have destroyed most of the evidence . From Indonesia the heliolithic culture-complex passed into the Pacific and eventually reached the American Coast in the neighbourhood of Peru and Mexico . ' - The proof of this migration , according to Professor Elliot Smith , lies in the mass of associated customs in the lands thus visited . He denies altogether the possibility that cultural resemblances may be due to the common tendencies of the human mind called into play by similar conditions . He is content to chart out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark the path of the dolmen builders after their migration from the original centre . The researches of Dr. Rivers , Mr. Perry , and other anthropologists suggest the propagation of culture far out in the Pacific , and // perhaps across it , such as was probably associated with the building of megalithic monuments similar in type to those that are known in Europe . Prof. Elliot Smith has certainly made out a fairly strong case for a relation between the dolmens of Western Europe and the megalithic culture of ancient Egypt . He has also shown with no small measure of success that the practice of mummification accompanied the setting up of megaliths as the culture proceeded eastwards . The natives of Torres Straits , for example , mummified their dead by processes resembling those of the XXI Dynasty in Egypt . It is , perhaps , - to be regretted that , in the present state of our knowledge , he did not stop at this point till such time as the unaccountable gaps in the allied customs can be filled up . However , the monograph only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be put forth when Professor Elliot Smith and his collaborators have collected further proofs of the migration of the culture-complex . Pending the production of a full statement of the evidence the hypothesis may be regarded as legitimate and plausible , though in a somewhat nebulous state at present . It seems evident that megalithic architecture was due to culture contact , since the monuments present a uniformity of structure hardly compatible with a theory of independent origin . // Again , it is difficult to explain the fact that they are confined to the coast-lands , except on the supposition that they were erected by a migratory race at the end of the Neolithic period and early in the Bronze Age . Could it be that so widespread and homogeneous a system arose simultaneously unless it were spread by a single race from a single centre ? True , it is no uncommon thing to find customs passed on from one people to another as a result of culture contact , especially if something was to be gained by the adoption of a new custom . Thus the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routes in the Iron Age , and many arts and appliances have been distributed over widely separated areas in a similar manner . But primitive man , though not slow to adopt new practices that will make for his pecuniary enhancement , is by no means ready to in any way alter his religious rites and beliefs . It is , therefore , highly improbable that the introduction of megaliths and their associated rites were due to culture contact . Bearing these facts in mind , and remembering at the same time the similarity in structure and the date of erection , there seems good reason to suppose that the megalithic monuments represent the work of one race . The objection to this conclusion raised by Declielette that the skulls found in the tombs do not present a uniformity of type 1 // overlooks the fact that on a long migration racial intermixture and consequently variation in features is almost sure to take place . At the same time there is a marked similarity in physical type among the people of the dolmens . Nevertheless , to grant the probability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a series of migrations is by no means the same thing as setting forth a cut and dried scheme of the distribution of a culture-complex , with unaccountable gaps in the allied customs , after the manner of Elliot Smith . The hypothesis , as far as it concerns the megalithic culture ( and perhaps also mummification ) is , we venture to think , sound as a general principle , but the details , as to how , when , and where the transmission took place can only be decided when sufficient data is forthcoming to supply the many deficiencies . The precise significance of the megalithic monuments is by no means easy to decipher , and various theories have been put forth to explain their origin and purpose . They have been described as Druidical and solar temples , places of sacrifice , religious or commemorative monuments and sepulchres . That most of the smaller cromlechs have been used as sepulchres has been proved by the finding of urns and burnt bones in association with human remains . At the same time it is difficult to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Stonehenge , Avebury , etc . It seems highly probable that by the end of the Neolithic Age a complex cult of the dead had arisen , and that these large cromlechs represent religious monuments erected near the graves of deified heroes , and were used for the performance of the ceremonies of the cult . Exactly what were the rites and beliefs of Neolithic man regarding life after death it is impossible to say , but evidently they involved a quasi-materialistic conception of the continued existence of the soul in the spiritworld , and the intercourse of mankind with the supernatural planes of being . The grave-goods , consisting of weapons , ornaments , the remains of food , human beings ( presumably the wife or slave of the deceased ) and animals , found in Neolithic interments , show that the people of those times did not regard life beyond the grave as differing widely from that on earth . To them death was the gate to a more perfect state of existence  --  the blessed company of departed heroes and friends  --  to which they looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was superior to this transient life , the abodes of the dead were considered of greater importance than those of the living . In the Neolithic period they were constructed of durable material , as we have seen in the case of the megaliths and pyramids of Egypt , and often placed on high ground so as
