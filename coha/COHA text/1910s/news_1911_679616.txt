txt It was so hot In this part of the country that Harry N. Atwood , who is now nearing the end of the most remarkable series of crosscountry flights in the history of America , was compelled to end his effort of to-day eight miles from this city instead of going on to Washington , carrying Charles K. Hamilton as a passenger , as he had planned . Atwood , - who had piloted Hamilton 's bit Burgess-Wright aeroplane from Atlantic City to Stemmer 's Run , the little town where he came down , in explaining the set-back , said it was due to the effeot of the intense heat and humidity , which 80 affected the operating mechanism as to make the engine work sluggishly , with the result that it was difficult at times to keep the machine in the air at all . Two attempts were made this evening to start on the last leg of the journey , but the heat and humidity had not abated and the machine refused to rise high enough for a flight . It was taken to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at whose home the men spent the night . Atwood was greatly disappointed OM the turn affairs took , just as the goal Of his long journey from Boston to Washington was in sight , but he is still undaunted . Before going to bed in a. little hotel at Stemmer 's Run to-night he said that he and Hamilton would go into the air again at 4 o'clock to-morrow morning and try to be in Washington in time for breakfast , and so earn the cup offered by Tun NEW Yong TIMES for the completion of his tourney from Boston ' to Washington . In this Journey Atwood has now flown 528 miles , out of a total of 576 miles . As it was , the flight was a. remarkable one . With only one stop , the aviators flew 148 miles , passing over Wilmington and lesser . cities and towns . The start was made at Atlantic City at 6:04 o'clock and the first landing at Farnhurst , Del. , at about 6:45 o'clock . The second start was made about 7:30 o'clock , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most unexpected visit in the history of the quaint little village . They were in the air about 216 minutes . Start Journey in a Haze . When Atwood and Hamiltongot wilt of their beds this morning after a few hours of sleep , following hard work to put the machine into the best possible condition , Atlantic City was as quiet as a cemtery . Not a sign of a breeze was in evidence when they arrived at the hangar at Ventnor at 4:15 o'clock , and the conditions appeared perfect for the proposed flight from that city to the National capital . Less than half a dozen persons were at the hangar to bid the aviators good luck on their journey . It was the third start for Washington in as many days , and even the aviators were fearful that the ill-luck that had pursued them would stick . It was 5:04 o'clock when Atwood signaled the mechanics to let go . The machine glided over the grass carpeted meadows for about thirty yards and then it shot into the air . Atwood pointed its nose in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seashore Railway . It disappeared from view in the half fog in a few minutes , but the music of the engine indicated to the mechanicans watched the departure that everything was in perfect working order . So it was , but the heat and humidity remained to be considered . For the first hour the flight was a delightful one . When the machine passed over the town of Newfield , N. J. , it was making about fifty miles an hour , and maintaining its altitude in splendid style . The same was true all the way to the Delaware River , the waters of which were first sighted by the aviators about 6:30 A. M. The machine had then gone more than seventy miles . Atwood noted that his gasoline was running low and shouted to Hamilton to watch for a good landing spot near some town . About eighty miles from Atlantic City they came ildown about 6:45 o'clock at Farnhurst , a small settlement south of Wilmington . They landed not far from the Delaware Insane Asylum and the doctors and ' nurses rushed out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both aviators were in good spirits , though Hamilton seemed to be somewhat fatigued . Race with a Fast Train . Atwood asked for gasoline , and a few I minutes later the ten gallons required were in the tank . The aviators took advantage of the landing to make an inspection of the machine . ' everything was found to be in good working order , and ' about 7:30 the aeroplane went up for the second time and fifteen minutes later Atwood found the Pennsylvania tracks near Wilmington and headed the machine for Washington . A t 7:45 they soared above Delaware - City about 750 feet in the air . After reaching the railroad tracks the airship made a mile a. minute , and it was going at the same rate when it passed New ' ark . A train out of the station had reached its maximum speed just as Atwood soared overhead . When the train pulled into Elkton , Md. , Atwood had gone four minutes before . It was not long , however , before the heat and humidity , which were then be ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the machine which had been maintaining altitudes of from 500 to 1,000 feet with ease , began to show the effects of the hostile conditions . Lower and . lower the aeroplane dropped , and , manoeuvre as he would , Atwood could not get it up . At 8:33 the machine was sighted from Havre de Grace , Md. , on the south side of the Susquehanna . At that time the aeroplane was not over 150 feet in the air . and was traveling at a speed estimated to have been between thirty-five and forty miles an hour . Five minutes afterward it was soaring gracefully at a low altitude above the houses of the pretty little Maryland city . It was so low that the aviators could see the faces of the people who stared up at them from below and waved good luck at them with their handkerchiefs . Fifteen minutes after passing Havre de Grace , Hamilton gave Atwood a gentle Poke in the ribs and pointed at the big dent in the upper Chesapeake Bay that is known by the natives as Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was most oppressive , and the machine was getting lower in the air every minute . As it swept over the broad waters of Bush River it was not more than sixtyfive feet above the ground , and had it , not been for the loud whirring of the engine the natives could have talked with the aviators . At Aberdeen the machine was so low that the aviators answered the smiles of the folks under them as they flew past . When Chase Station was reacned , about three miles north of Slemmer 's Run , both Atwood and Hamilton realized that it was only a question of minutes before they would be compelled to make-a landing . All Slemmer 's Run was on hand , but none dreamed that the machine was going to land In their back lot , but it did just the same , about 0:2,3 o'clock and the wnole town was around it when Atwood and Hamilton climbed out of their seats . " What 's the matter : - everybody asked . " Too much heat , that 's all , " Atwood solemnly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ilamilton shrugged his shoulders and murmured something that made Atwood smile . " Oh . well , " said Atwood , " we will get there yet even if a little behind time . " " ? Sure we will , but I wanted to get there this morning , " Hamilton replied . Atwood then made an effort to get an automobile to take Hamilton and himself into Baltimore but there were no taxicabs or other motor vehicles in Stemliter 's Run and they haci to wait for a local train which landed them in Baltimore at 10 o'clock . They were the centre of public interest when they got to the cityAt the Hotel Rennert , where they we'n.t , everybody tried to find out at the same time what it was that had caused them to land . " Sometimes . " explained Atwood , " we barely got over the trees . It was the hardest job I 've ever tackled keeping that machine in the air . You know even the best automobile motors have trouble this kind of weather . " Attempt Flight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed , announcing that they would get up in time to resume the flight to Washington by 0 o'clock . They then expected to reach the capital at 7 o'clock . At 5 o'clock they returned to Stemmer 's Run in the automobile of Walter Townsend . who has a country estate there . Louis Feld , on whose farm the/ aviators had landed , was not satisfied with the $10 Atwood had paid , in the morning , and demanded more . A $20 bill seemed to satisfy him . A crowd had gathered about the machine and the aviators and the country folk helped pull the craft to a rise in the land . Several futile efforts were made by Atwood to ascend , but it was as hot and humid as early in the day . Atwood even was too heavy to be carried to Mr. Townsend 's estate , so Hamilton . who is forty pounds lighter , stepped aboard , and after several attempts soared skyward . He quickly rose to an altitude of 400 feet , circled the field , and then struck out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly on the other side . He crossed the tracks , circled four times , barely missing the tops of tail trees and the railroad station , - and then came to earth , in a field of young wheat . Atwood and the Townsends were taken to the farm in the Townsend automobile , and upon their arrival there the aeroplane was hitched on behind and towed to tit house , a mile away . It was placed under a carriage shed for the night so the dew would not dampen its wings . and then the weary aviators accepted Mr. Townsend 's hospitality for the night .
