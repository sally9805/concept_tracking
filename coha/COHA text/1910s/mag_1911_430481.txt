 | WE have heard our political leaders say from time to time that " War is necessary , " " War is a good thing . " They were trying to establish a major premise which would suggest the conclusion : " Therefore let us have a little war now , " or " It is wise , on general principles , to have a war once in a while . " That argument may be taken as the text of the present essay . It has seemed to me worth while to show from the history of civilization just what war has done and has not done for the welfare of mankind . In the eighteenth century it was assumed that the primitive state of mankind was one of Arcadian peace , joy , and contentment . In the nineteenth century the assumption went over to the other extreme ? that the primitive state was one of universal warfare . This , like the former notion , is a great exaggeration . Man in the most primitive and uncivilized state known to us does not practice war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather be described as a peaceful animal . Real warfare comes with the collisions of more developed societies . I f we turn to facts about the least civilized men we find proofs that they are not warlike and do not practice war if they can help it . The Australians , for example , have no idea of conquest or battle . Their fights do not lead to slaughter or spoils or other consequences of victory . Some2 YALE REVIEW  | times a fight takes the form of a friendly trial of skill with weapons between two parties who , one by one , cast their weapons at each other . Quarrels between tribes are sometimes settled by a single combat between chiefs . " Real fighting rarely takes place unless the women arouse the men " ; and even then it is only carried on by taunts and wrestling . " The first wound ends the combat . " It is often followed by a war of words , hair-pulling , and blows with yam-sticks between the women . The reason why the Australians have no war is because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribe has anything to tempt the cupidity of another . They have no political organization , so there can be no war for power . Each group appropriates hunting grounds , and over these war arises only with the increase of population . An Englishman who knew them well said that he had known of serious wounds , but of only one death from their affrays . Again , the Papuans of New Guinea are not warlike in all parts of the island . Like other men on the same grade of civilization , they may be assassins , but they are not warriors ; and if two bodies of them meet in hostility , we are told that " there is a remarkably small death-roll at the end of the battle . " Of another group of them it is said that they have no offensive weapons at all , but live without disturbance from neighbors and without care for the future . Their children rarely quarrel at play , and if they do , it ends in words . We are told that they lack the courage , temper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good schoolboy fight . Perhaps the converse would be true : they have no schoolboy fights and therefore have no courage , temper , and concentration of will . We are not astonished to hear that they develop excessive tyranny and cruelty to those who are weaker than themselves , especially to women , and even to their mothers . These people are excessively distrustful of each other , and villages but a little distance apart have very little inter- course . In general they know the limits of their own territory and observe them , but they quarrel about women . The people in German Melanesia are of the same kind ; they are cowardly and mean , make raids on each other 's land to destroy and plunder , when they think they can do it safely , but they will not join battle . On some of the small islands war is entirely unknown . In contrast with these and similar cases we find other examples of extreme warlikeness , which account for the current idea that primitive men love war and practice it all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwarlikeness which have been cited , we see that only two or three seem to present evidence of that Arcadian peace and simplicity which the eighteenth century philosophers imagined to have been the condition of men in a state of nature . Probably if we had fuller knowledge these few instances would be much modified . What we see is that men have always quarrelled . The cases which have been selected are some of them those of people who have been defeated , broken , and cowed down . Another set of examples consists of those in which abstinence from war is due to cowardice , and with it go the vices of cowardice ? tyranny and cruelty to the weak . These cases are calculated to delight the hearts of the advocates of strenuosity . What our testimonies have in common is this : they show that we can not postulate a warlike character or a habit of fighting as a universal or even characteristic trait of primitive man . When we undertake to talk about primitive society we should conceive of it as consisting of petty groups scattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I want a term of the widest significance . This group may consist , as it does amongst Australians and Bushmen , of a man with one or possibly two wives and their children , or it may have a few more members , or it may lie a village-group as in New Guinea , or a tribe or part  | of a tribe as amongst our own Indians . It is to be observed that this ultimate unit is a group and not an individual . Every individual excludes every other in the competition of life , unless they can by combining together win more out of nature by joint effort than the sum of what they could win separately . This combination is what makes groups and brings about industrial organization . When a man and woman unite in the most elementary group known , they do it for economic reasons , because they can carry on the struggle for existence better together than apart . In time this turns into a kin-group , united " by blood . " This remains undivided as long as its organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big for the existing economic system . As soon as it breaks into two , these begin to compete with each other . If by greater culture a higher organization becomes possible , two groups coalesce by intermarriage or conquest , competition gives way to combination again , and the bigger unit enters into competition with other composite units . Thus at all stages throughout the history of civilization , competition and combination forever alternate with each other . These groups are independent of each other , their size being determined by their mode of life , because the number who can live together economically is limited by the possibilities of the food-quest . When a group outgrows this limit , it breaks up and scatters . The fact of former association is long remembered , and there is a bond of kinship and alliance which may draw former associates together again at times for festivals and religious observances ; but after they separate the tendency is to become entirely independent and to fall under the type just described , that is , scattered groups each with its individuality , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship does not keep them from quarrelling and fighting . In the Book of Judges we see , for example , instances of war between tribes of Israel in spite of the  | higher bond which united them with each other and separated them from the Gentiles . All the members of one group are comrades to each of her , and they have a common interest against every other group . If we assume a standpoint in one group , we may call that one the " we-group " or the " in-group " ; then every other group is to us an " others-group " or an " outgroup . " The sentiment which prevails inside the " wegroup , " between its members , is that of peace and cooperation ; the sentiment which prevails inside of a group towards all outsiders is that of hostility and war . These two sentiments are perfectly consistent with each other ; in fact , they necessarily complement each other . Let us see why this is so . War arises from the competition of life , not from the struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is wrestling with nature to extort from her the means of subsistence . It is when two men are striving side by side in the struggle for existence , to extort from nature the supplies they need , that they come into rivalry and a collision of interest with each other takes place . This collision may be light and unimportant , if the supplies are large and the number of men small ; or it may be harsh and violent , if there are many men striving for a small supply . This collision we call the competition of life . The greater or less intensity of this competition is a fundamental condition of human existence , and the competition arises between those ultimate unit-groups which I have described . The members of the unit-group work together . The Australian or Bushman hunter goes abroad to seek meat food , while the woman stays by the fire at a trysting place , with the children , and collects plant food . They cooperate in the struggle for existence , and the size of the group is fixed by the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode of life . Such a group , therefore , has a common interest . It must have  | control of a certain area of land ; hence it comes into collision of interest with every other group . The competition of life , therefore , arises between groups , not between individuals , and we see that the members of the in-group are allies and joint-partners in one interest while they are brought into antagonism of interest with all outsiders . It is the competition of life , therefore , which makes war , and that is why war has always existed and always will . It is in the conditions of human existence . In the cases which have been cited of nature-peoples who have no war , we have heard mention already of division of hunting grounds and of quarrels which arise about them . Wherever there is no war , there we find that there is no crowding , as among the scattered Eskimos , or that , after long fighting , treaties and agreements have been made to cover all relations of interest between the groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they consist in conventional agreements which create some combination between the groups which are parties to the agreement . Each group must regard every other as a possible enemy on account of the antagonism of interests ; and so it views every other group with suspicion and distrust , although actual hostilities occur only on specific occasion . Every member of another group is a stranger . He may be admitted as a guest , in which case rights and security are granted him ; but if not so admitted he is an enemy . We can now see why the sentiments of peace and cooperation inside are complementary to sentiments of hostility outside . It is because any group , in order to be strong against an outside enemy , must be well disciplined , harmonious , and peaceful inside ; in other words , because discord inside would cause defeat in battle with another group . Therefore the same conditions which made men warlike against outsiders made them yield to the control of chiefs , submit to discipline , obey law , cultivate peace , and create institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in-group  | from . the usages established there securing peace . There was a double education , at the same time , out of the same facts and relations . It is no paradox at all to say that peace makes war and that war makes peace . There are two codes of morals and two sets of mores , one for comrades inside and the other for strangers outside ; and they arise from the same interests . Against outsiders it was meritorious to kill , plunder , practice blood revenge , and to steal women and slaves ; but inside none of these things could Ile allowed because they would produce discord and weakness . Hence , in the in-group , law ( under the forms of custom and taboo ) , and institutions , had to take the place of force . Every group was a peace-group inside , and the peace was sanctioned by the ghosts of the ancestors who had handed down the customs and taboos . Against outeiders religion sanctioned and encouraged war ; for the ghosts of the ancestors , or the gods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeat , slay , ph Hider , and enslave the ancient enemy . We find , then , that there are two sentiments in the minds of the same men at the same time . These have been called militancy and industrialism . The latter term does lint seem to be a good one , and it is not apt until we reach high civilization ; what we want is a term to express the pence sentiment in antithesis to militancy , but industrialism has obtained currency , and it has this much justification , even for savage life , that , inside the group , the needs of life must be provided for by productive labor . Generally that is left to the women and the men practice militarism . It would not be possible for neighboring groups to remain really isolated from each other . One has in its territory stone or salt , water or fuel , limited fruits , melons , nuts , fish , or perhaps other natural materials which the others need . They also take wives from each other , generally but not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring about a middle state of things  | between war and peace . These treaties are the origin of international law . A comparison of modern municipal and international law will show that the difference between the relations of members of the in-group with each other , and of the groups with each other , still exists . If we now turn back to the question with which I started , whether men began in a state of peace or a state of war , we see the answer . They began with both together . Which preponderated is a question of the intensity of the competition of life at the time . When that competition was intense , war was frequent and fierce , the weaker were exterminated or absorbed by the stronger , the internal discipline of the conquerors became stronger , chiefs got more absolute power , laws became more stringent , religious observances won greater authority , and so the whole societal system was more firmly integrated . On the other hand , when there were no close or powerful neighbors , there was little or no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiefs had little power , and a societal system scarcely existed . The four great motives which move men to social activity are hunger , love , vanity , and fear of superior powers . If we search out the causes which have moved men to war we find them under each of these motives or interests . Men have fought for hunting grounds , for supplies which are locally limited and may be monopolized , for commerce , for slaves , and probably also for human flesh . These motives come under hunger , or the food-quest , or more widely under the economic effort to win subsistence . Men have fought for and on account of women , a motive which we must put partly under love , although the women were wanted chiefly as laborers and so , along with the slaves , would come under the former head . They have fought to win heads , or scalps , or other trophies , and for honor or dignity , or purely for glory ; this comes under the operation of vanity . They have fought for blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to please their gods ; these motives belong under the fear of superior powers . It was reserved for modern , civilized men to fight on account of differences of religion , and from this motive the fiercest and most persistent wars have been waged . Is there anything grand or noble in any of these motives of war ? Not a bit . But we must remember that the motives from which men act have nothing at all to do with the consequences of their action . Where will you find in history a case of a great purpose rationally adopted by a great society and carried through to the intended result and then followed by the expected consequences in the way Of social advantage ? You can find no such thing . Men act . from immediate and interested motives like those for which they have waged war , and the consequences come out of the forces which are set loose . The consequences may be advantageous or disadvantageous to men . The story of these acts and consequences makes up human history . So it has been with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for revenge and superstition , they were building human society . They were learning discipline and cohesion ; they were learning cooperation , perseverance , fortitude , and patience . These are not savage virtues ; they are products of education . War forms larger social units and produces states . The great conquests have destroyed what was effete and opened the way for what was viable . What appals us , however , is the frightful Waste of this process of evolution by war ? waste of life and waste of capital . It is this waste which has made the evolution of civilization so slow . Here , then , let us turn back and see how the peace-element develops alongside the war-element . We shall find that peace-rules and peace-institutions have been established from the earliest civilization , even for the relations of groups with each other . House-peace is perhaps the simplest form . the nature-people very often bury a man under his own  | fireplace , and from this usage radiate various customs , all of which go to associate the ghosts of the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarrelling , brawling , or violence near the hearth is an insult to the ghosts . Hence arises a notion of religious sacredness about the hearth , an atmosphere of peace is created , and the women who live in the house and work at the hearth profit by it . The householder has a dignity and prerogative iii his house , however humble his social position may be ; hence the maxim that a man 's house is his castle goes back to the beginning of civilization . It may be only a wind-shelter , but the ghosts protect it ; and any stranger , fugitive , suppliant , even an enemy , if admitted , comes under the house protection and hospitality while there . As the house becomes larger and better , the peace-taboo extends from the fireplace to the whole house and then to the yard or enclosure . This is the house-peace . If any group which possesses deposits of salt , flint-stone fit for implements , pipe-stone , water supply , or special foods should try to prevent others from having access to the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until an agreement was made and established by usage . This agreement is either one of peaceful access to natural supplies or one of trade . Tribes also agree to take wives from each other . We often have reason to be astonished at the institution making power of nature-men when disagreeable experience has forced them to find relief . The Tubu of the Sahara are warlike and distrustful even of each other to such an extent that they scarcely form a society ; even in their villages they quarrel and fight . It is a very noteworthy feature that these people have no notion of rights . It is the in-group as a peace-group which is the school of rights : as we have seen , there can be peace and order inside only by law ( using this term in its broadest sense ) ; but a law creates and enforces rights . Now these Tubu have beer , forced to make a law that inside the village no weapons  | My he worn , so that here already we find an institutional arrangement to limit warlikeness . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and threatened to go away , they pointed out to him that as soon as he had left heir territory he would be at their mercy . This shows that even they had an idea of some rights of a guest inside their group as compared with his status outside , when he would be protected by nothing . The Bedouin have the same notion . They are ruthless robbers and murderers , but a guest in the tent is perfectly safe and entitled to their best hospitality . When he leaves it he is fair game , whether enemy , friend , or neighbor . The Christian states have always professed to moderate somewhat the horrors of war when they went to fighting with each other , and so we have laws of war which are good between the states agreeing to them , but not with outsiders . This makes a limited peace-group of all the states which now unite to make international law . Let us follow these institutions up into higher civilization . The Scandinavian people spread in small bodies over their territory , and these bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a common sanctuary at Upsala at which there were annual festivals . The religious bond kept up a certain sense of national unity , which however has never produced national sympathy . At the festivals as Upsala peace was enforced for the time and place ; disputess were settled and fairs held , and there were feasts and conferences . The Swedes in the thirteenth century formed kin-groups which adopted rules of mutual succor and defense . The dwellings of kings also came to have in far the character of sanctuaries that peace was maintained around them . The ancient Germans maintained by law unei severe penalties peace for women as to person and property ; the penalties for wrong to a woman varied in the laws of the different German nations , but were two or three times as great as for wrongs to men . The house- peace was also very fully developed in German law . The Peace of God was perhaps the most remarkable case in history of a law to establish a time-taboo against war and violence . In the tenth century the church tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were often repeated with little result , but the " Truce of God " was at last established in 1041 by the Bishop of Arles and the Abbot of Cluny ; and it won some acceptance throughout France . There was to be no fighting between Wednesday evening and Monday morning ; later these limits were changed . No such law was ever obeyed with any precision and it never became a custom , much less an institution , but it had some influence . As the kings gained real power and prestige in the feudal states they made the king 's peace a great reality ; it went with the development of the modern state The king 's peace was a name for a central civil authority which could put down all private war and violations of public order , and establish a peace-group over a great extent of territory , within which rights , law , and civil authority should be secured by competent tribunals . In the Holy Roman Empire of the German nation the public general peace of the empire was introduced in 1495 , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did not exist until 1873 . We can see how the king 's peace grew by the following case : Canute the Dane made a law in England that , if any unknown man was found dead , he should be assumed to be a Dane and a special tax , called murdrum , should be paid for him to the king . William the Conqueror followed this example , only the unknown man was assumed to be a Norman ; if it could be proved that he was an Englishman ( " proving his Englishry " ) then the murderer or the hundred had nothing to pay to the king but only the legal compensation to the family of the deceased , if he had one . This means that the king first extended his peace over his own countrymen by a special  | penalty for the murder of one of them , while Englishmen were left under the old law of composition for blood revenge ; but in time equal protection was extended to all his subjects . Again , at the time of the Conquest all crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canterbury , for instance ) were crimes against the king 's peace ? which also extended one league , three perches , and three feet beyond the city gate . This means that the high roads which ran through a town were first brought under the king 's peace , and this peace also extended beyond the royal burgh for an extent which was measured with droll accuracy . What was a crime elsewhere was a crime there , and what was not a crime elsewhere might be a crime there . King Edmund forbade blood revenge in his burgh ; that is , he delimited an in-group in which there must be law and an administration of justice by his tribunal ; Jews and merchants bought the protection of the king 's peace throughout his realm . From this germ crew up the state as a peace-group and the king 's peace as the law of the land ; we Americans call it the peace of the people . We have now found a peace of the house , of the sanctuary , of religion , of the market , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king , all of which were legal and institutional checks upon war and an introduction of rational and moral methods in the place of force . Let us now see what has been the relation between religion on the one side and peace or war on the other . Those who perform the rites of worship towards the same ancestors or the same gods come into the same cult-group , but no religion has ever succeeded in making its cult-group into a peace-group , although they have all tried to do it . The salutation of members of a cult-group to each other very generally " Peace , " or something equivalent . Quakers call themselves " Friends , " and always have a closer bond to each other than to the outside world . Such  | a peace-group is an ideal only for all who profess the sail religion ; in most of the great religions down to the seventeenth century , dissenters or heretics were always treated with great severity , because it was thought that they would bring down the wrath of the ghost or the god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The New England Puritans had this notion that the sins of some would bring down the wrath of God on the whole . Religion has always intensified ethnocentrism ; the adherents of a religion always think themselves the chosen people , or else they think that their god is superior to all others , ? which amounts to the same thing . The Jews looked down upon all nonJews as Gentiles ; the Mohammedans despise all infidels ? their attitude towards non-Mussulmans is one leading to aggression , plunder , and annihilation . The Greeks looked down on all non-Greeks as barbarians , but in their case the sentiment was only partly religious ; they themselves were never united by their own religion . Nicholas V in 1452 gave to Alfonso V of Portugal authority to subjugate any non-Christians , having in view especially people of teh west coast of Africa , and to reduce them to servitude ( illorum personas in servitutem ) , which probably did not mean slavery , but subjection . The Spaniards and Portuguese of the sixteenth century treated all aborigines with ruthlessness , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or consideration . When the American colonies revolted , the English were amazed that the colonists could ally themselves with Frenchmen against the mother country , since the French were Roman Catholics in religion , absolutists in the state , and of an alien nationality . Buddhism is characterized by a pervading peacefulness ; but no religion has ever kept its adherents from fighting each other . The instances which have been cited suffice to show that religion has been quite as much a stimulus to war as to peace ; and religious wars are proverbial for ruthlessness and ferocity .  | page deleted  | of the masses ; but very few people seem to know to what a great extent all these things are consequences of the discovery of the new world . As to this matter of war which we are now considering , the fact that the new world is removed to such a distance from the old world made it possible for men to make a new start here . It was possible to break old traditions , to revise institutions , and to think out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever seemed good and available in the inheritance from the old world . It was a marvellous opportunity ; to the student of history and human institutions it seems incredible that it ever could have been offered . The men who founded this republic recognized that opportunity and tried to use it . It is we who are now here who have thrown it away ; we have decided that instead of working out the advantages of it by peace , simplicity , domestic happiness , industry and thrift , we would rather do it in the old way by war and glory , alternate victory and calamity , adventurous enterprises , grand finance , powerful government , and great social contrasts of splendor and misery . Future ages will look back to us with amazement and reproach that we should have made such a choice in the face of such an opportunity , and should have entailed on them the consequences ? for the opportunity will never come again . Some illustration of our subject has , however , been furnished by the internal history of our peace-group . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace-bond , and our law about them is , consequently , full of inconsistencies . Sometimes they have been treated as comrades in the in-group ; sometimes as an out-group with which our group was on a footing of hostility . Another question seems to be arising with respect to the negroes ; we have been trying , since the Civil War , to absorb them into our peace-bond , but we have not succeeded . They are in it and not of it now , as much as , or more than ,  | In the days of slavery , for the two races live more independently of each other now than they did in those former days . The Southern States do not constitute true societies , because they lack unity of interest and sentiment , on account of the race difference which divides them . This discord may prove worse and more fatal to the internal integrity of the peace-group than such old antagonisms of interest as disturb Ireland , the national antagonisms which agitate Austria-Hungary , or the religious antagonisms which distract Belgium . In short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is sufficient concord and sympathy to overcome the antagonisms of nationality , race , class , etc. , and in which are maintained institutions adequate to adjust interests and control passions . Before even the great civilized states shall have reached this model , there is yet much to be done . If we look at these facts about peace-laws and institutions and the formation of peace-groups in connection with the task for war , we see that militancy and peacefulness we existed side by side in human society from the begining just as they exist now . A peaceful society must be industrial , because it must produce instead of plundering ; is for this reason that the industrial type of society is opposite of the militant type . In any state on the continent of Europe to-day these two types of societal organization may be seen interwoven with each other and fighting each other . Industrialism builds up ; militancy wastes . If a railroad is built , trade and intercourse indicate a line on which it ought to run ; military strategy , however , overrules this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests of trade and intercourse must be subjected to constant delay and expense because the line does not conform to them . Not a discovery or invention is made but the war and navy bureaus of all the great nations seize it to see what use can be made of it in war . It is evident that men love war ; when two hundred thousand men in the  | United States volunteer in a month for a war with Spain which appeals to no sense of wrong against their country , and to no other strong sentiment of human nature , when their lives are by no means monotonous or destitute Of interest , and where life offers chances of wealth and prosperity , the pure love of adventure and war must be strong in our population . Europeans who have to do military service have no such enthusiasm for war as war . The presence of such a sentiment in the midst of the most purely industrial state in the world is a wonderful phenomenon . At the It is said that there are important offsets to all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . Institutions and customs in human society are never either all good or all bad . We can not adopt either peacefulness or warlikeness as a sole true philosophy . Military discipline educates ; military interest awakens all the powers same time the social philosophy of the modern civilized world is saturated with humanitarianism and flabby sentimentalism . This humanitarianism is in literature ; by it the reading public is led to suppose that the world is advancing along some line which they call " progress " towards peace and brotherly love . Nothing could be more mistaken . We read of fist-law and constant war in the Middle Ages , and think that life must have been full of conflicts and bloodshed then ; but modern warfare bears down on the whole population with a frightful weight through all the years of peace . Never , from the day of barbarism down to out own time , has every man in a society been a soldier unlit now ; and the armaments of to-day are immensely more costly than ever before . There is only one limit possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , the last man and the last dollar it can control . What will come of the mixture of sentimental social philosophy and warlike policy ? There is only one thing rationally to be expected , and that is a frightful effusion of blood in revolution and war during the century now opening .  | of men , so that they are eager to win and their ingenuity is quickened to invent new and better weapons . In history the military inventions have led the way and have been afterwards applied to industry . Chemical inventions were made in the attempt to produce combinations which would be destructive in war ; we owe some of our most useful substances to discoveries which were made in this effort . The skill of artisans has been developed in making weapons , and then that skill has been available for industry . Gunpowder was discovered in the attempt to rediscover Greek fire ; it was a grand invention in military art , but we should never have had our canals , railroads , and other great works without such an explosive . Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of military agents for our friction matches . War also develops societal organizations ; it produces political institutions and classes . In the past these institutions and classes have been attended by oppression and by the exploitation of man by man ; nevertheless , the highly organized society has produced gains for all its members , including the oppressed or their posterity . The social exploitation is not essential to the organization , and it may be prevented by better provisions . In long periods of peace the whole societal structure becomes fixed in its adjustments and the functions all run into routine . Vested interests get established control ; some classes secure privileges and establish precedents , while other classes form habits of acquiescence . Traditions acquire a sacred character and philosophical doctrines are taught in churches and schools which make existing customs seem to be the " eternal order of nature . " It becomes impossible to find a standing-ground from which to attack abuses and organize reform . Such was the case in France in the eighteenth century . By war new social powers break their way and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that even a great social convulsion is worth all it costs . What other force could  | break the bonds and open the way ? But that is not the correct inference , because war and revolution never produce what is wanted , but only some mixture of the old evils with new ones ; what is wanted is a peaceful and rational solution of problems and situations ? but that requires great statesmanship and great popular sense and virtue . In the past the work has been done by war and revolution , with haphazard results and great attendant evils . To take an example from our own history : the banking and currency system of the United States , in 1860 , was at a deadlock ; we owe the national bank system , which was a grand reform of currency and banking , to the Civil War . It is impossible to see how else we could have overcome the vested interests and could have extricated ourselves from our position . It was no purpose of the war to reform the currency , but it gave an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we could . There is another effect of war which is less obvious but more important . During a period of peace , rest , and routine , are developed powers which are in reality societal variations amongst which a certain societal selection should take place ; but then it is necessary to select them . Here comes in the immense benefit of real liberty , because , if there is real liberty , a natural selection results ; but if there is social prejudice , monopoly , privilege , orthodoxy , tradition , popular delusion , or any other restraint on liberty , selection does not occur . War operates a rude and imperfect selection . Our Civil War may serve as an example ; think of the public men who were set aside by it and of the others who were brought forward by it , and compare them in character and ideas . Think of the doctrines which were set aside as false , and of the others which were established as true ; also of the constitutional principles which were permanently stamped as heretical or orthodox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority of the President of the United States as it was before and as it  | has been since the Civil War . The Germans tell of the ruthless and cruel acts of Napoleon in Germany , and all that they say is true ; but he did greater services to Germany than any other man who can be mentioned . He tore down the relics of medievalism and set the powers of the nation to some extent free from the fetters of tradition ; we do lint see what else could have done it . It took another war hi 1870 to root out the traditional institutions and make way for the new ones . Of course the whole national life responded to this selection . The Roman state was a selfish and pitiless subjugation of all the rest of mankind . It was built on slavery , it cost inconceivable blood and tears , and It was a grand system of extortion and plunder , but it gave security and peace , under which the productive powers of the provinces expanded and grew . The Roman state gave discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern world has inherited societal elements which are invaluable . One of the silliest enthusiasms which ever got control of the minds of a great body of men was the Crusades , but the Crusades initiated a breaking up of the stagnation of the Dark Ages and an emancipation of the social forces of Europe . They exerted a selective effect to destroy what was barbaric and deadening , and to foster what had new hope in it by furnishing a stimulus to thought and knowledge . A society needs to have a ferment in it ; sometimes an enthusiastic delusion or an adventurous folly answers the purpose . In the modern world the ferment is furnished by economic opportunity and hope of luxury . In other ages it has often been furnished by war . Therefore some social philosophers have maintained that the best course of human affairs is an alternation of peace and war . They sometimes also argue that the only unity of the human race which can ever come about must be realized from the survival of the fittest in a war of weapons , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adaptability to the industrial organiza- tion . It is not probable that aborigines will ever in the future be massacred in masses , as they have been in the past , but the case is even worse when , like our Indians for instance , they are set before a fatal dilemma . They can not any longer live in their old way , they must learn to live by unskilled labor or by the mechanic arts . This , then , is the dilemma : to enter into the civilized industrial organization or to die out . If it had been possible for men to sit still in peace without civilization , they never would have achieved civilization ; it is the iron spur of the nature-process which has forced them on , and one form of the nature-process has been the attack of other men who were stronger than they . We find , then , that in the past as a matter of fact war has played a great part in the irrational nature-process by which things have come to pass . But the nature-processes are frightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of individuals ? for it is only individuals who have feelings and interests . The nature-elements never suffer and never pity . If we are terrified at the nature-processes , there is only one way to escape them ; it is the way by which men have always evaded them to some extent ; it is by knowledge , by rational methods , and by the arts . The facts which have been presented about the functions of war in the past are not flattering to the human reason or conscience . They seem to show that we are as much indebted for our welfare to base passion as to noble and intelligent endeavor . At the present moment things do not look much better . We talk of civilizing lower races , but we never have done it yet ; we have exterminated them . Our devices for civilizing them have been as disastrous to them as our firearms . At the beginning of the twentieth century the great civilized nations are making haste , in the utmost jealousy of each other , to seize upon all the outlying parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the construction of navies by which each may defend its share against the others . What will happen ? As they are preparing for war they certainly will  | have war , and their methods of colonization and exploitation will destroy the aborigines . In this way the human race will be civilized ? but by extermination of the uncivilized ? unless the men of the twentieth century can devise plans for dealing with aborigines which are better than any which have yet been devised . No one has yet found any way in which two races , far apart in blood and culture , can be amalgamated into one society with satisfaction to both . Plainly , in this matter which lies in the immediate future , the only alternatives to force and bloodshed are more knowledge and more reason . Shall any statesman , therefore , ever dare to say that it would be well , at a given moment , to have a war , lest the nation fall into the vices of industrialism and the evils of peace ? The answer is plainly : No ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken up and applied by routine rule . No war which can be avoided is just to the people who have to carry it on , to say nothing of the enemy . War is like other evils ; it must be met when it is unavoidable , and such gain as can be got from it must be won . In the forum of reason and deliberation war never can be anything but a makeshift , to be regretted ; it is the task of the statesman to find rational means to the same end . A statesman who proposes war as an instrumentality admits his incompetency ; a politician who makes use of war as a counter in the game of parties is a criminal . Can peace be universal ? There is no reason to believe it . It is a fallacy to suppose that by widening the peace-group more and more it can at last embrace all mankind . What happens is that , as it grows bigger , differences , discords , antagonisms , and war begin inside of it on account of the divergence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature and are in all societies all the time , part of the energy of the society is constantly spent in repressing them . If all nations should resolve to have no more armed ships , pirates would re-appear upon the ocean ;  | the police of the seas must be maintained . We could not dispense with our militia ; we have too frequent need of it now . But police defense is not war in the sense in which I have been discussing it . War , in the future , will be the clash of national vanity and selfishness when they cross each other 's path . If you want war , nourish a doctrine . Doctrines are the most frightful tyrants to which men ever are subject , because doctrines get inside of a man 's own reason and betray him against himself . Civilized men have done their fiercest fighting for doctrines . The reconquest of the Holy Sepulchre , " the balance of power , " " no universal dominion , " " trade follows the flag , " " he who holds the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the altar , " the revolution , the faith ? these are the things for which men have given their lives . What are they all ? Nothing but rhetoric and phantasms . Doctrines are always vague ; it would ruin a doctrine to define it , because then it could be analyzed , criticised , and verified ; but nothing ought to be tolerated which can not be so tested . Somebody asks you with astonishment and horror whether you do not believe in the Monroe Doctrine . You do not know whether you do or not , because you do not know what it is ; but you do not dare to say that you do not , because you understand that it is one of the things which every good American is bound to believe in . Now when any doctrine arrives at that degree of authority , the name of it is a club which any demagogue may swing over you at any time and apropos of anything . In order to describe a doctrine we must have recourse to theological language . A doctrine is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound to believe , not because you have some rational grounds for believing it true , but because you belong to such and such a church or denomiof state . " The most frightful injustice and cruelty which have ever been perpetrated on earth have been due to the nation . The nearest parallel to it in politics is the " reason  | page deleted 26 YALE REVIEW  | well showed the danger of having a doctrine lying loose about the house , and one which carries with it big consequences . It may mean anything or nothing , at any moment , and no one knows how it will be . You acccede to it now , within the vague limits of what you suppose it to be ; therefore , you will have to accede to it to-morrow when the same name is made to cover something which you never have heard or thought of . If you allow political catchword to go on and grow , you will awaken some day to find it standing over you , the arbiter of your destiny , against which you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process by which such catch-words grow is the old popular mythologizing . Your Monroe Doctrine becomes an entity , a being , a lesser kind of divinity , entitled to reverence and possessed of prestige , so that it allows of no discussion or deliberation . The President of the United States talks about the Monroe Doctrine and he tells us solemnly that it is true and sacred , whatever it is . He even undertakes to give some definition of what he means by it ; but the definition which he gives binds nobody either now or in the future , any more than what Monroe and Adams meant by it binds anybody now not to mean anything else . He says that , on account of the doctrine , whatever it may be , we must have a big navy . In this , at least , he is plainly in the right ; if we have the doctrine , we shall need a big navy . The Monroe Doctrine is an exercise of authority by the United States over a controversy between two foreign states one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States to accept any responsibility in connection with the controversy . That is a position which is sure to bring us into collision with other states , especially because it will touch their vanity , or what they call their honor ? or it will touch our vanity , or what we call our honor , if we should find ourselves called upon to " back down " from it . Therefore it is very true that we must expect to need a  | big navy , if we adhere to the doctrine . What can be more contrary to sound statesmanship and common sense than to put forth an abstract assertion which has no definite relation to any interest of ours now at stake , but which has in it any number of possibilities of producing complications which we can not foresee , but which are sure to be embarrassing when they arise ! What has just been said suggests a consideration of the fallacy in the popular saying , " In time of peace prepare for war . " If you prepare a big army and navy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to war ; the military and naval men will have a lot of new machines and they will be eager to see what they can do with them . There is no such thing nowadays as a state of readiness for war . It is a chimaera , and the nations which pursue it are falling into an abyss of wasted energy and wealth . When the army is supplied with the latest and best rifles , someone invents a new field gun ; then the artillery must be provided with that before we are ready . By the time we get the new gun , somebody has invented a new rifle , and our rival nation is getting that ; therefore we must have it , or one a little better . It takes two or three years and several millions to do that . In the meantime somebody proposes a more effective organization which must be introduced ; signals , balloons , dogs , bicycles , and every other device and invention must be added , and men must be trained to use them all . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls for never-ending sacrifices . It is a fallacy . It is evident that to pursue such a notion with any idea of realizing it would absorb all the resources and activity of the state ; this the great European states are now proving by experiment . A wiser rule would be to make up your mind soberly what you want , peace or war , and then to get ready for what you want ; for what we prepare for is what we shall get .
