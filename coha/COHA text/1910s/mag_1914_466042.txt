this time of the year the Queensland tropical coast was flourishing under the last of the rains . Here , far in the north , it is sheltered well , ? 2 from the worst gales of the South Pacific and the Coral Sea by the Great Barrier Reef . It is a rich and lovely coast , indeed . There are many islands , all of tender color , green and yellow and gray , in the vagrant , showery rains and cloudy sunsets , and a thousand placid azure channels , sunlit and warm and languid , and good harbors as well , and brown , deep , perpetual rivers . And there are pastured hills , and abundant fruit and sugar lands , with towns of promise , shaded with palm and banyan and pepper trees ; and beyond , over the ranges , lie wild grassy highlands , the unsettled bush awaiting its inevitable occupation still more remote in the west . These were autumn showers ? March showers ? clearing showers . Some fine day , and that soon , too , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud , its last shred of mist , and the dry , blue weather of winter would set in , mellow and dependable . Dry weather impended a stretch of sparkling winter months : what rains would fall were near all down , determining the season . Out of Colombo , where , late in the spring before this , on the voyage to Sydney , the Australian mails were put aboard , the Returning Queenslander had come uproariously into the smoking-room , waving the latest Melbourne newspaper , his amiable big face alive and alight and warmly flushed with relief . " I 've got mine ! " he shouted . What was this ? " Rain ! " Rain ? " Rain , m ' boy ! Rain in Queensland ! Rain in Queensland ! Ten inches at my station already ! My word ! " As a matter of course , fall now approaching , the Queensland coast , to which we had come these many miles from Colombo , was by this time drenched . But the hack-blocks ? What about the Queensland back - blocksCunnamulla and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no drought in the back-blocks . The thing was determined . It was all over with : the rains were down in the back-blocks . Copious rains , too ? thirty inches , sixty inches , eighty inches . Most of the Queensland streams were in flood , the water-holes overflowed , the downs were springing , the farthest bush was in good green health . Grass was assured in Queensland ? grass in abundance for the twenty millions of Queensland sheep , knee-high grass for the five million head of Queensland cattle , fattening wayside grass for the long , slow droving over the stock-routes to the markets at tidewater . There was no shadow of disaster . Station-owners , planters , selectors : they would flourish every one . It was to be a season of plenty , coast and bush and grass-lands , maize and tobacco and sugar-cane , bananas and matchless pineapples and every luscious tropical fruit . Fat beef , too , and hurter and toothsome mutton and much good wool . A moment before the stars had been out ? the Southern Cross winking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merrymaking little Queensland town . The shower had crept overhead in the dark . With the first heavy drops , spattering hot and smartly in the circle of torchlight , the brass-band , playing a Friday-night concert on the grassy beginnings of the beach , midway of the street in front of the hotel , made ready for flight by hastily executing some perfunctory chords of " God Save the King , " once more to declare an ample and unfaltering patriotism . It seemed to be an obligation of heroic importance . But having blown these fervid blasts and wheezes , in defiance of the deluge , and having broken down in a confusion of piccolo toots and bass-horn snorts , the bandsmen doused their torches and took to their heels . There was a pelting shower to urge them ? a first volley of great , tepid drops . And it was a rout . Off they tumbled to shelter , in shameless disorder , after a scurrying audience of tanned Australians , white-clad and superior , and of ragged black fellows , of mincing , squealing Chinamen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year , " the Inspector of Mounted Police repeated . " Think of it ! " We reflected and were astonished . " Sometimes twenty , " says he . It was amazing . " Why , " he went on , delighted , to complete our surprise , " I 've known it to rain an inch an hour ? and keep on raining all day , too . But it does n't rain everywhere in Queensland like that , you know . I 'm speaking of the coast here . In New South Wales I 've known it to rain six and one-half inches in two hours ! Flood ? Quite so ! At MoolooIah , here in Queensland , they once had a fall of over twenty-nine inches at a pour . And back on the Blackall Range , on the second of February , eighteen hundred and ninety-three , " he concluded , delivering the circumstantial thrust with a triumphant smile , " it rained no less than thirty-six inches ! " He paused . " Do you take it ? " he inquired , anxiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we had taken it . " Three feet of water ! " " One yard . " It was hard to adjust this prodigious spectacle for comparison . " Quite so , " says he . " What 's the rainfall in New York ? " This was altogether beyond us . " Quite so , " he agreed , briskly ; " I 'll find out . " He dodged into his own quarters ? all the sleeping-rooms of that airy tropical hotel opened on the upper veranda ? and presently returned , thumbing a great book in which the useful knowledge was contained . " Here we have it : ' New York : forty-two inches ' ? the average . That is to say , to wit : that in the little place I 'm telling you about , here in Queensland , almost as much rain fell in a day and a night , let us say , as falls in New York in the course of a whole year . " He looked over his spectacles to catch our surprise . There was a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you know Singapore ? " he inquired . We knew something of Singapore ? its dismal reputation in this respect . In Singapore it showers every dadr ? or twice as much the next " Quite ? day . lute so , " said he . " Then let me tell you this : it rains about two and one-half times as much in Singapore as it does in New York , and four times as much as it rains in London ; and here on the northeast coast of Queensland " ? he slapped the book shut for emphasis ? " it rains almost twice as much as it dues in Singapore ! " " Some rain , " I remarked . " Some ? " he protested , not used to the American twist . " Not too little ! " " Not too little ? " " I mean a jolly good lot . " " And I. " It was an understanding . Down came the rain , then ? a mighty dousing of the town ! It cleared the walks , obscured the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights , drenched the banyans , flooded the streets , and pervaded every shelter with warm moisture ; and it beat a furious uproar on the iron roof of the upper veranda of the hotel , threatening to demolish it flat forthwith , and continued the tumult , without lessening the pitch for an instant , as if mischievously determined , this season , at last , to complete its perennial endeavor to dissolve the trim town cluster and wash it into the harbor by way of its own gutters . And the patter and gurgle and splash of nand the thick night and the sudden torrent in the street ? gave point to the Inspector 's happy contention that service with the Queensland mounted police was in the rainy season a devilish rigorous employment . We were to under-stand that the service demanded men ? men with a smart liking for adventure , and with body and heart enough , too , to further the inclination on its way to the last frontiers of romance . We were to understand , in short , that it demanded blooded men ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inspector declared , " and as cunning as a rat . " The Inspector had himself come through the rough and tumble of the service , years of remote patrol and the bloody business of pursuit , with cattle-thieves , outlaws , and red-handed savages to fetch in from the bush , dead or alive  - -  the long riding , in flood and blistering drought , and the tracking , the chase , the shooting , the capture ; and he was now at last become an officer of conspicuous rank in a distinguished , wide-riding organization of a military sort , as delicately jealous of its efficiency and honor as any British regiment of the regular line . He was no mere superior of city hobbies , snaring timid small game in the streets , with a tap on the shoulder for sufficient weapon and authority : he was a veteran of the big man-hunt -- a sentimentalist under the skin , withal , and seasoned with Irish tenderness . We gathered presently that for many years he had lived in close and CXXVI I I . ? No. 765. - 53affectionate companionship with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a complete expression . And plainly it had been philosophy enough . A simple performance , truly ; yet it had fashioned a man who was still unable to contemplate fear and shame and all manner of dishonor in men with anything short of amazement . " I say , " said he , his voice lowered , his attitude inviting confidence , as though the thing should be spoken of under cover , " what about that New York murder ? " " Which New York murder ? " " The one they have on their hands . " " Which one ? " Somewhat in the manner of a stage villain the Inspector peered around to make sure of privacy . " The gambler , you know , " said he , cautiously . " Shot down in front of a New York pub , was n't he ? Right ? " That was ghastly fact . " And they have an inspector of police in custody ? Charged with complicity , is n't he ? What 's the truth of it ? The despatches say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dripping cloak and khaki came clicking down the veranda with a telegram . He saluted , presented the message , saluted again , stepped back his paces ? according to the regulations , doubtless ? and saluted for the third time , standing then at attention , until , having been dismissed , he took instant advantage of a last opportunity to salute and clicked away . Whatever the contents of the message , they preoccupied the Inspector past continuing his pursuit of dependable information relating to the incredible conduct of the police of New York . A trooper of any state of the Commonwealth . having measured up to the physical standard of a man , not less than a wiry five-foot-eight of length and a muscular bulk of eleven stone , with a good eve to back that minimum , and having been heartily accredited as to character , and having shown an aptitude for the service , and having exposed his quality in general , in the course of a cunning interview with the Commissioner , who has a sharp eye for defects and a touchy regard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a twelvemonth 's rigorous military training , whence he emerges , at last , a soldierly fellow ? as trim and disciplined and impersonally swift in the performance of duty as many old Tummies of the British line . It is a far patrol , at first ? some last region of the back-blocks , where rogues and black fellows are to be kept in hand and a widely scattered and forlorn community is to be served with paternal solicitude by the only representative of the state within the hope of reach . There are almost seven hundred thousand square miles to , olice , from Thursday Island to the long New South Wales border , which implies lonely billets , vast districts , and long riding in haste . " 1 rode , once , after a cattle-duffer , " said the Inspector , " two hundred and twenty-five miles in thirty-six hburs . " He was a big man . " Seventeen stone and eight at the time , " said he . From the beginning of his service the earth of his neighborhood shakes when the trooper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brushedand polished , with the broad brim of his felt hat flirted up at the side , in the Australian way , or galloping the dusty roads on active service , clanking authority with every hoof-beat , or perched behind the hump of his camel , lumbering through the deserts . It is a heartening spectacle , indeed , wherever encountered in the bush-lands of the Commonwealth ? New South Wales , Victoria , South Australia , Tasmania , Western Australia , the Northern Territory , or Queensland . A soldierly figure , spick and span , as opportunity runs : khaki-clad in the heat , with serge and leather trappings for winter weather , and white cord breeches , a white helmet , and sword for parade . He has a wide latitude of discretion . It is assumed at headquarters , it seems , that in any event he will be on the right side of justice and propriety . And he is the law of the frontiers : where he rides there is order , and where his hand falls in the King 's name there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the service . In the days when the Inspector was a trooper ( said he ) he took a savage black fellow ? meaning by this a black fellow of some uncivilized bush ? for the murder of a white squatter . The slaughter of one black fellow by another is relatively a thing of small consequence ; the aborigine who achieves this savage ? clat is chastened by an easy detention of a year or two and liberated to his tribe . But to spear a white man is a crime most heinous and intolerable . It is visited with a pursuit which seldom stops short of capture or a death at bay in the open ? a chase of a thousand miles , it may be , and quick , grim action at the end of it , arrest or the alternative . Having now with vast satisfaction taken his savage , the Inspector made haste back with him toward his station to dodge the impending rains . But the rains caught him . A river , dry in the outward track , was widely in flood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatening a long increase ? the Inspector stopped , chagrined . It was wild country , and the trooper was alone with his captive , who desired nothing more , as the trooper very well knew , than a cunning opportunity to do his captor to death . A crossing must be made . " Well , now , how , " the Inspector inquired of us , in twinkling expectation of our bewilderment , " did I manage it ? " " You swam . " He laughed . " First of all , " I continued , to make ? I ca n't a stroke . " " Then you did n't get across ? " " Ah , but I did ! " he cried , delighted . " I made my prisoner take me . And the big devil had a clever dodge , too . I give him credit for cunning ? I do that . He was to loop a strap over his forehead , you see , and let me flop along at the other end . It was the surest way , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . But it did n't suit my book . Ah , they 're sly , treacherous brutes ! Trust myself with that nigger free in the water ? Not I ! I love my life . He would have turned on me midway . Ile would have had me drowned in a jiffy . Ah , no , ' says I ; ' it may be that I 'm to drown , but if I drown . you 'll drown , and that 's the way we 'll have it , b ' gorry ! ' So I strapped his wrist to mine ? with a foot of leather for leeway . There was no getting loose , neither for him nor for me . ' T would take the slash of a knife to du it . I saw to the lashing myself . Do you take my plan ? If one of us went , both would go . I had him fast . He could n't get away . He might drown me , quite so ; but I would have my bands on his throat before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would pay with his life . " " And then ? " " I drove him into the water . He took me across . " It was a prodigious adventure . " I wonder why it is , " the Inspector mused , " that you ca n't keep a young dog of a trooper from doing foolhardy things like that. ? " " A young dog ? " " That 's it ! " says he . " Sheer youth : " In the early Queens-land days ? when the Black Police , a con-stabulary of half-tamed savages , offi-cered by white men , rode the country , the ruthless arm of the law on the wild frontier ? sentiment was for a time not seriously op-posed to the extermi-nation of the black fellows . In the eyes of the settlers they were like wild beasts ? their appearance , customs , and beha-vior . It was the custom to shoot the culprits at sight , their tribesmen and dingoes ; and there were men who kept tally of their achievements in the field ? " Thirty-seven to date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cattle , hamstrung the horses , thieved what they could lay hands on , and were sometimes bold and cunning enough to murder the settlers , having first tortured them with devilish inven-tion ; and for all this wanton work they were in reprisal massacred in defenseless droves ? driven to corner , in lagoons and hollows , like rabbits and wallaby , and shot or cut down without any let-up until the last shivering wretch had fallen . It was a black business altogether : there are gruesome tales abroad of those days ? of natives hunted for sport or picked off for target practice , and of the employment of great fires to dispose of the game when bagged in awkward numbers . " Poisoned ' em , too , " said an acquain Lance of the road we traveled . It was a tale so grotesquely improbable that we laughed in scorn of it . " No , nor ' protested our gentleman . " I mean it . " " How , then , was the thing man-aged ? " " Easily enough . Poisoned ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flour . " Traveling the roads of the Queensland back-blocks we encountered a black fellow shuffling through the dust from his reservation to town . He was an old man , an old , old man , in reservation slops , whose countenance excited a convulsion of disgust , so very bestial was it , and whose proximity , in a general way , was altogether shocking to one 's composure . He had no savage pride , like a North American Indian , to win the smallest measure of any man 's . respect ; nor had he any jollity , like a negro , to gain an indulgent regard , but had only a slouch and a mumble and a half-witted titter . Somewhat he resembled a ncgro -- the color and thick lips and flat nose of him ; but he had no clear , mild eye , nor was he in any way upstanding and frank ? flaring red and treacher-ously shifty little eyes , indeed , - set far back , and a slinking way , like a mongrel dog brought to heel ; and a gap in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ape . Indeed , he was so debased in feature and demeanor that it stirred the wrath to find him fashioned indubitably in the likeness of a man . Beholding him , I was almost enabled to credit the preposterous tale that it was at one time thought to be no grave breach of Christian morality to feed the aborigines to the dugs . He was no fair example , to be sure , of his own race . Near by this town , long ago , this man 's tribe had murdered a family of settlers in the night , save one lad , who escaped death by opportunely tumbling to the floor between the bed and the wall , himself wounded , unconscious , and left for dead . What the provocation was nobody knows . It is probable that there was no specific provocation . It had doubtless been a wanton thing ? a childish mischief ? undertaken upon savage impulse and accomplished for nothing more than the momentary pleasure of dealing death to some living creature . This was the inspiration of many similar deeds ? neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanton blood-lust , indulged , celebrated , laughed over for the time , and forgotten ; and therein lies a sufficient explanation of the terrible character of the retaliation . Whatever the case , the hoy , having thus narrowly survived , made his way to Brisbane , where he related his story to the authorities , and to such good purpose , as it turned out , that he was given a rifle and free leave to return to his district and shoot as many black fellows as he could manage , being heartily assured that the law would not molest him . " You see , " said our fellow-traveler , " he was regularly licensed . " " By the Department of Game and Fisheries ? " I scoffed . " Ah , come , now ! " he replied . " I am not joking . I do not mean to say , " he went on , " that the authorities gave this boy an engraved license , suitable for framing , but I do assert that they commissioned him to kill black fellows , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a good many . And he did kill black fellows ? hundreds of them , possibly . He killed them where he could find them , running the hush or employed on the stations , not even hesitating in the presence of their white masters . And by and by the thing became a nuisance . It was awkward for the station-owners to have their black boys disposed of in this way . There were complaints . I recall that one station-owner had his best black servant shot from the saddle on the road . He was very angry ; but the boy flourished his commission and the station owner could do nothing about it . The end of it was that the boy was summoned to Brisbane and bought off . The old black fellow whom we passed a few moments ago boasts that he was once pursued by this i industrious youngster . And he had a narrow escape . He says that he took to the river , and that he submerged himself , breathing meanwhile through a reed until the hunt was given up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherished by the state with anxious solicitude ? encouraged with rations , blankets , schoolteachers , and by others with religious instruction . A Chief Protector of Aborigines , his deputies and the police , are charged with the business . " All we can do , " said a Queensander of consequence , with rhetorical pathos , " is to ease the last moments of this dying race . " But there are the outlands . Australia is most populous on the coast . There is a rapid decrease as the country approaches the wild interior . Railroads stop far short of it . Civilization thins out . The towns diminish and scatter and the stock-stations grow to vast and vaguely bounded estates . In the remotest back-blocks the stations merge with the wild lands ; and beyond ? toward the center of the continent ? lie the deserts and unmapped bush-lands and the lusty savage life of them . In the Never-Never ( as the outermost places arc called ) the trooper 's duty concerns itself largely with the capture of offending blacks who ' escape to the dry-lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spear cattle and occasionally murder settlers and unwary travelers ; and they must surely be taken and pun-ished if security is to he established in the rich lands of the Never-Never . It is a service which sometimes demands the exercise of an amazing ingenuity and daring . " All the cunning , " the Inspector declared , again , " of a bubonic rat ! " Once the Inspector ? the Inspector with whom we sat on the broad upper veranda of the hotel ? was caught on the wrong side of a river of the outlands with a problematical black tracker and two vicious and mighty prisoners . It was far " out back " ? the empty wilderness . And it was the beginning of the rainy season . A drenching rain was falling when they came to the bank . It went whipping past with half a gale of wind . The river , in flood , was a wide , brown , swirling torrent , carrying a swift and threatening freight of trees and dead underbrush . It was not a heartening prospect , ruffled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : there were currents , shallows , whirlpools ? a deep rush of water . The Inspector 's prisoners were not repentant culprits . They were naked , savage , terrified by capture and restraint ; and their irons had fretted them near to madness . In short ( said he ) they were like wild beasts , lately taken in a jungle , being conveyed to captivity . And the black tracker , too , was a source of grave perplexity . He was not to be trusted : he was himself fresh from the bush , half-tamed , not proven ; and it was the part of caution to assume that he had rather join forces with the Inspector 's prisoners than serve the Inspector . ? It will be recalled that the Inspector could not swim . " Not a stroke , mind you ! " said he . It was a predicament , indeed . With what shrewd resource the Inspector solved the many and perilous difficulties of the situation could not be fathomed by the most cunning bushman ? nor invented by the most reckless teller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly passable , at best , and here in the wilderness there was no craft for crossing it . To attempt to swim the horses through a flood so wide and violent would be to invite the treachery of the black tracker and the escape of the prisoners . There would he confusion ; and the issue of that confusion would be the Inspector 's death or dishonor . It was not to be chanced . The prisoners must be kept close ; they must be unshackled , at last , and driven into the water , but they must surely be kept within range and reasonably placid aim . They could not be shepherded to the other side from the back of a frenzied horse . The black tracker , too , always a menace in a predicament , must be restrained , if by nothing more salutary than a cold glance , occasionally cast in his direction , carrying the threat of quick death . " You must n't let your tracker get behind your back , " the Inspector paused to explain . " No , no ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A raw one , especially , " he replied , " if you 're in trouble . They 're treacherous brutes . " First of all the Inspector lashed two V-shaped pack-saddles end to end . And here , then , was the framework of a small craft . He turned them upside down . It was a good beginning . Of the oilcloth cover of his swag ( blankets ) he fashioned an outer skin . This he tucked in and kept firmly in place by means of some sapling branches . The craft was finished . He launched it . It floated ? floated dry ; and so low was its center of gravity when he sat in it ( like a man in a bathtub ) that it seemed to be amply seaworthy , notwithstanding the turbuknee of the current it must weather . How , then , to propel it across ? Well , CXXVIII. ? Xo. 755. - 54the Inspector 's ingenuity did not fail him . His inspiration had included the means . Having disarmed his black tracker and despatched him in advance with the horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harnessed his two prisoners to the bow of his craft and set out on his voyage , his heart in his mouth with fear of drowning , his stout person rigidly upright and stationary , his revolver covering the astonished creatures whom in this remarkable way he compelled to swim with him in safety to the other side , where , devoutly thankful , he resumed his journey . " It is quite the most extraordinary exploit of the sort , " I protested , " that ever I heard of ! " " Quite so , " said he , mildly . After all , the black fellows of the outlands are no warriors . They are given to bloody mischief ? to foolish , wanton murder , accomplished from ambush or in the dark . In packs they are truly to be feared by a helplessly inferior force . But they do not make war . As compared with the North American Indian of pioneering days , for example , they are no worse than exasperating . Speaking in the loose fashion of the layman , they are of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they do not practise agriculture even of a most primitive description ; they have no fixed habitations , but only the mia-mia , a temporary canopy or wind-break of brush . Thus from season to season they subsist and wander like the beasts of the held . And they are not in a largely more intelligent way capable of concerted action . They have no hereditary chiefs ? no chiefs , properly speaking , at all , except old men of more or less influence . Consequently an attack by any tribe in full force and under powerful leadership is not to be expected ; and an alliance , tribe with tribe , for sustained and directed war , could never occur . Wary travelers are safe enough in their progress through t'ae land , and the outermost settlers of the Never-Never , so long as they do not neglect the accepted , simple precautions , are reasonably secure . Australia is rid of the bushrangers who long ago celebrated the roads of the colony with their picturesque villainies . It is a curious circumstance that the last band of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incased in vizored helmets and a sort of medieval armor . Bushranging vanished with the gold-fever of Victoria and New South Wales . In the Kalgoorlie days there was no highwayman of conspicuous achievement . Nor was there much lawlessness of a capital degree : the small offenders ? thieves and claim-jumperswere merely drummed out of camp and forbidden the fields . But there are half-caste and white rogues to be dealt with by the constabulary in the back-blocks . In some small town of the Queensland bush we encountered the announcement that His Excellency the Governor had been pleased to direct the offer of five hundred pounds in reward for the capture of a young horse-breaker whose mother was a half-caste Chinese and whose father was a Kanaka . It was an enterprising crime : between Turkey Station and Bustard Head the refugee had shot down the swain of a young woman of whom he was himself enamoured , and had thereupon carried her off with him on the back of his horse , leaving no trace . Shearers and drovers are a wild company to keep in hand when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the back-block public-houses . " Ah , yes , but they do n't draw knives , " said the Inspector , " and they do n't shoot from their coat-pockets . " In short , their customs were British . " They settle their differences with their fists , " the Inspector declared , warmly , " like men ! " Once the Inspector cut out his quarry from a " mob " of rogues in a shanty-saloon of the Queensland frontier . It was a remote and dangerous wayside inn ? a rendezvous , after a sort , of cattle-duffers ( thieves ) and outlaws and suspects of every Australian description . " he enter single-handed and demand a man in the King 's name was a feat of cold temerity ; but the Inspector accomplished it without agitation ? a casual arrest , as it were , an affair of no general consequence ? and rode away with his captive . It was a hanging charge . The prisoner had nothing more to lose . He would kill the Inspector if he could . And the Inspector had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day 's riding was done . They made . camp in the hush . The billy was boiled . There was a companionable smoke ? more amiable and diverting conversation . It turned out that the prisoner was a clever , agreeable fellow . The Inspector rather fancied him . But at last , night having fallen , and the talk languishing with the fire in the bowls of the pipes , and a journey of many days lying ahead , and the Inspector being desperately sleepy , it was time to turn in . How about a guard ? The Inspector did not by any means propose to lose a night 's sleep . It was a simple arrangement , after all : the Inspector handcuffed his prisoner- to his own wrist , threw his revolver out of reach , and lay down to sleep . " Why dispose of the weapon ? " I inquired . " I had no wish to kill my prisoner . " " Very true ; but your prisoner ? " " A tussel ? Ah , well , I looked him over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was . " " But he might ? " " Pish ! " the Inspector scoffed , " I would n't give him the satisfaction of even thinking I was afraid of him . " Well , now , it was still raining . A wet night , truly ? a drenching , splashing , gurgling night . Rain drummed on the roof and overflowed the eaves . The air was thick with a tepid moisture . It was dark in the flooded streets . The town had gone to bed . Another dripping trooper came clicking down the broad veranda and interrupted the Inspector with a punctilious salute and a telegram ; and having been dismissed , like the first , and having executed the maximum number of salutes allowed by the regulations , he clicked off into the rainy night , leaving the Inspector in the mind to pursue his quest of reliable information relating to the alleged incredible conduct of the police of New York . This he did with the most polite consideration . Our pride was not to be damaged in the least . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he intended no reflection upon the quality of our constabulary ? no indelicate insinuation whatsoever . We were to understand that . And , moreover , he was not disposed to discuss an affair so questionable in the open . As it chanced , our situation was secluded . Except for ourselves the broad veranda was deserted . Yet the Inspector sat up in his steamer-chair and peered cunningly around to make sure that our privacy was not a thing of appearance only . " I say , " he whispered , leaning confidentially near , " what about that New York Inspector of Police ? " " He is in custody . " " In custody ! Think of it ! Well , now , I say , between ourselves , you know ? you wo n't take this amiss , I 'm sure ? the despatches seem to hint at what they call ' an alliance between the police and crime . ' Really , now , what do they mean by such extraordinary talk as that ? " ' That there is an alliance . ' " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged ? " " 0 Lord , yes ! " " My word ! " the Inspector gasped . Really , he was greatly shocked .
