txt Every one agrees that the ballot used at the last election in this city was a nuisance and a scandal . It gave rise to numerous errors which partially disfranchised those who committed them . It was Immense in size and extremely unhandy . It was confused , and made the intelligent choice of candidates needlessly difficult and tedious . There is a general desire for its radical amendment , and , fortunately , there is an unusual degree of agreement as to the direction in which the amendment should be made . The bill originally introduced by ARTENAS WARD , Jr. , of the Twentyfifth New York District , will come up in the Assembly to ? - day . It is , on the whole , an excellent bill , though we think that it can be amended to make it still better . The chief aim of the bill is to simplify the ballot while guarding all Constitutional rights . The principal means by which this Is done are : The abolition of the party column , the printing of no name more than once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the title of that office , the placing of the party emblems by themselves in a double column at the left of the ballot . The first result is that instead of a ballot three or four feet long I we have one less than sixteen inches square , with the names and emblems as clear as In the larger one . Ample provision is made for the illiterate voter to cast a straight vote by simply putting a cross in the circle next the emblem of the party he prefers . This in our judgment is all that the Constitution requires to be done for that class of voters , and all that is physically possible . Of course the provision for straight voting by illiterates is equally available for all . Straight voting is in no wise discouraged , nor should it be . Independent or selective voting  --  the split vote  --  is also amply provided tor . There is not the slightest trouble made for any man who wishes to vote for any candidate , if ha can read the name . There Is , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voter who wishes to split his vote , which seems to us unnecessary , clumsy , and ineffective . Each emblem is accompanied by a letter , and under the name of each candidate are placed the letters accompanying the emblems of the parties by which he is indorsed . The theory seems to be that the voter is entitled to see when he looks at a name exactly what parties have approved it . We do not see that it helps an illiterate to give him a letter , which he can not read , by which to recognize a name which also he can not read . The only way he could be enabled to detect a candidate would be by emblems attached to each name , and that would , In the late election , have required seven emblems to , be tacked on the name of Judge GAYNOR , to the infinite botheration rather than/the enlightenment of the unfortunate illiterate . ? We think that the Ward ballot , as provided for , Would be quite adequate to all reasonable requirements if , in addition to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party circle , it stopped with providing for a split vote by marking the name of each candidate preferred by the voter . It is true that fills mode of independent voting would be difficult for an absolute illiterate , but , under such instruction as he can obtain , if he wishes , it would not be impossible . Nor would it be more difficult for him to express his preference than under the old system of tickets prepared by or " for each party . The only objection likely to be urged with any earnestness or sincerity against this general plan of a ballot is that it encourages straight voting . That is idle . It does nothing of the sort , any more than it encourages independent voting . It makes both fairly easy , as it should . It does not discourage straight voting , and it would not be right that it should . Probably ninetenths , certainly a great majority , of the voters wish to vote straight , and  - -  - t there Is no sense in a. law Intended to prevent them . The wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite within the rights of citizenship and it is neither fair nor practical to seek to defeat it , or to legislate those who feel it into a different frame of mind :
