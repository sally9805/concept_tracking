txt More German diplomatic sttipidity , involved , as usual . in intrigue and inability to understand an obvious situation , was exposed by Secretary Lansing today . Count von Bernstorff , the former German Ambassador , who is now In congenial society in Constantinople , Is again shown in an unfavorable light . The substance of a statement made by the Secretary of State was that when Count von Bernstorff last January asked the Imperial Government at Berlin for $50,000 to influence the American Congress , he was aware that Germany was about to resume ruthless submarine warfare , which he also knew would bring a severance of relations between dermany and the United States .. His message asking for the 00,000 corruption fund was sent on ? Jan. 22 , 1917 . Secretary Lansing said that on or before Jett ' , 19 the Ambassador had read the order from Dr. Zimmermann , German Minister for Foreign Affairs , directing Admiral von Eckhardt , the Minister in Mexico . to arrange an alliance between the Japanese and Mexican Governments to attack the United States and alienate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that on Feb. 1 Germany would begin unrestricted submarine warfare . Bernstorff knew this from the Zimmermann message , and lie wanted the corruption fund to endeavor to stay the inevitable resentment of the American Government . In the case of the Channel liner Sussex President Wilson had served notice on Germany that if any further instance ? cccurred of the sinking of merchant vessels by German submarines without giving passengers and crews a chance to escape to places of safety , the United States would break relations with Germany . Has Conclusive Evidence Secretary Lansing 's statement of his Iknowledge that Count von Bernstorff knew at least twelve days in advance tnat Germany was about to resume ruthless submarine warfare was brought out by questions asked by newspaper men . His ' attention was called to reJorts that the State Department had much more material exposing German intrigue , and he was asked if he would clear up some misunderstanding as to 1 whether the department had any evi1 dence to . show that when von Bernstorff asked the Berlin Government to permit him to use *50,000 as a fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warfare was to be resumed . Mr. Lansing 's answer was in the , affirmative . In his statement he said that/ the Department of State " possesses conclusive evidence " that Count von Bernstorff had received the Zimmermann telegram of instructions about the proposed Japanese-Mexican alliance against the United States " on or before Jan. 19 . " Mr. Lansing emphasized his statement by calling attention to the fact that Count ' von Bern , storff was fully advised of his Government 's intention to have U-boats destroy merchant ships without mercy at the time he asked for the 1250,000 fund " to influence Congressional action in favor of the continued neutrality of this country . " The quoted words are Mr. Lansing 's . With this new light thrown on German methods , it is apparent that *when Germany prepared to resume ruthlessness at sea , she did so in the expectation that she would be able to keep the United States out of the war . Those who knew Count von Bernstorff here are not inclined to concede that . he had so badly judged the situation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing $50,000 worth of influence to bear on the American Congress . The fact remains , however , that he asked for the money for that specific purpose and presumably used it through a propagandist campaign in the vain endeavor to prevent a break in diplomatic relations . Secretary Lansing 's statement follows : In view of inquiries which have been made as to whether Count Bernstorff knew of the purpose of his Government to renew relentless submarine warfare when he sent his message of Jan. 22 , 1917. asking authorization to expend $50,000 . I can state that the Department of State possesses conclusive evidence that on or before Jan. 10 Count Bernstorff had received and read the Zimmermann telegram to Minister von Eckhardt in Mexico , which contained the following : " We intend to begin on the first of February unrestricted submarine warfare . We shall endeavor , in spite of this , to keep the United States of America neutral . " Count Bernstorff was , therefore . fully , advised of the intentions of the Imperial Government at the time when he asked for authority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action in favor of the continued neutrality of this country . Swedish Envoy Sees Wilson . W. A. F. Ekengren , the Swedish Minister , called on President Wilson today , an unusual thing . The visit to the White House was followed by reports that the Swedish emissary had been recalled on account of the accommodating attitude of Swedish diplomatic officers in transmitting military information to Germany under the cover and protection of the Swedish diplomatic code , and had gone to the White House to say farewell to the President . The Swedish Minister at Buenos Aires and the Swedish Charge d'Affaires at Mexico City had been caught in the pastime of forwarding to Berlin through Stockholm messages of an unneutral character . At the State Department it was said that the reason for Minister Ekengren 's visit to the White House was not known , but he had not been recalled by his Government . Mr. Ekengren said that he expected to remain in Washington many years . No official statement was obtainable . At the same time it became known through official quarters that the Argentine Ambassador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aires by the Swedish Minister there to his Government . Three at least of these telegrams , as the State Department has disclosed , contained military information for the German Government . In one of the messages transmitted by the obliging Swedish Minister for Count von Luxburg , his German colleague , was recommended that two Argentine steamers , then on their way to Prance , should be allowed to pass unharmed by ** or be sunk without a trace being left . The admission was made at the State Department that the department knew that such messages had come to the Argentine Embassy . Dr. Romulo Naon , . the Argentine Ambassador , declined to confirm or deny a report that he had received the messages . A press dispatch from Buenos Aires said that the Argentine Governmerit had transmitted to Dr. Neon 41 , E dispatches sent from that capital to his Government by the Swedish Minister with a request that they be translated . All that was said today indicated that the messages were turned over to the State Department which IS in a position , judging by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbols that conceal the meaning of the telegrams . Ekengren Seeking ' to Explain . Taking for granted that the Swedish Minister in Washington has not beet ; recalled or notified that he is no longer persona grata to the United States , it is apparent that Mr. Ekengren 's call at the White House meant that the Swedish Government felt that it was necessary to offer an explanation concerning the transmission of unneutral information to Germany . It is suggested that Minister Ekengren saw the President in behalf of the King of Sweden . in this connection the question is being asked here tonight : How did Count von Bernstorff receive the Zimmermann message in Washington at a time when the use of cables and wireless by Germany was impossible on account of the British control of cables and the inability of the German Government to communicate by radio between Berlin and Washington ? The State Department declines to throw any light on the subject . The information contained in the press dispatch from Buenos Aires that more than 400 outgoing telegrams of the Swedish Legation there had been sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and the knowledge that the translation is to be dniw ender the direction of the State Department created much interest here . It . was taken as confirming the suspicion that this Government has means of ascertaining the plain language text of German and Swedish cipher dispatches . Sweden is honeycombed with German agents of every kind , and lately a large number of German army officers have gone to that country . It was stated in informed quarters today that there had not been as great popular pro-ally swmpathy in Sweden as has been generally supposed , and substantiation of thi - statement was said to have been given by the elections just held there , in which the Socialist leader , Branting , failed to win the support it was expected he would receive , especially after the Lansing exposure of the unneutrality of toe present Swedish Government . It is thought here now that the Ministry will remain in power , the gains made by the Socialists and Liberals not being considered sufficient to defeat the Cabinet . The net result of the exposure and the elections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the friendliness of the Court sad Government for Germany .
