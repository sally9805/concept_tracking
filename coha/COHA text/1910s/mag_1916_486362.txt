The Trustees of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching will have before them for decision , at their annual , meeting on November 15 , recommendations of President Pritchett looking to a radical alteration of the methods and functions of that trust. * Mr. Pritchett 's proposals have already caused much fluttering in professorial dovecotes , and have evoked criticism and protest in many academic quarters . What is at issue , however , is not merely the private interest of a few college teachers , but the future usefulness of one of the greatest of American benefactions to education . The new proposals can be fairly judged Only in the light of the special purpose for which the Foundation exists . That purpose was defined with entire clearness at the time of the establishment of the fund , and has since been frequently reiterated . It is to " dignify " the status , strengthen the personnel , and raise the efficiency , of the academic profession , by increasing the economic attractiveness  --  or decreasing the economic disadvantages  --  of the scholar 's calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleemosynary ; but its distinctive methods for improving educational conditions consist in ( a ) enlarging the eventual total reward which may be hoped for by those who adopt the profession of teaching and investigation , and ( b ) facilitating the retirement of men whose usefulness has been impaired by age or disability . This intention was made plain in the opening words of Mr. Carnegie 's letter of gift : I have reached the conclusion that the least rewarded of all the professions is that of the teacher in our higher educational institutions . . . The consequences are grievous Able men hesitate to adopt teaching as a career , and many old professors whose places should be taken by younger men can not be retired . The earlier reports of the president of the Foundation repeated and amplified this explanation of the purposes of the fund . " The first and largest ground for the establishment of systems of pensions for teachers , " wrote Mr. Pritchett in his first report , " has been found in the wish to strengthen the Profession of the teacher . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the teacher can not be depended upon to secure an adequate supply of the best men . " " It is true that the real teacher finds in the joy of teaching his chief reward . . . but it Is alsci true that as the rewards and the honors of a profession increase it will become more attractive to men of ability , strength , and initiative . " It is a fundamental principle that , " to better the profession of the teacher , and to attract into it increasing numbers of strong men , it is necessary A. Comprehensive Plan of Insurance and Annuities for College Teachers . By Henry S. Pritchett . New York . 1916. that the retiring allowance should come as a matter of right , not as a charity , " should be received by the teacher " on exactly the same basis as that upon which he receives his active salary , as a part of his academic compensation . " The new plan is ostensibly designed precisely to make possible a better realization of this original and principal object of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have , after all , considered rather the needs and the state of mind of men already in the profession  --  and , indeed , approaching the end of their active service  --  than the needs and state of mind of men standing at the threshold of the academic career The benefits promised by the present rules to teachers in. " accepted institutions " are the following : ( a ) old-age pensions , available at sixty-five or later , and amounting usually to some 60 per cent . of the salary received by the teacher during his last five years of service ; ( b ) disability pensions , in cases of total disability , but only after twenty-five years of service as professor , or thirty years as professor and instructor ; ( a ) pensions to widows of teachers who have fulfilled either of the preceding conditions , equivalent to one-half that which the husband received or was entitled to receive . These three benefits , substantial as they must appear to men in advancing years , may well seem somewhat remote to a young man considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been , moreover , no legal means of compelling the eventual payment of these benefits , and there has been much reason in the past history of the Foundation for doubting whether its promises would be fulfilled . In short , for the hazards of the earlier years of professional life the Foundation has hitherto offered no provision at all ; and even for its remoter contingencies it has offered no complete security . Reflecting , in the light of ten years ' experience , upon these " weaknesses " of the existing scheme , Mr. Pritchett proposes to add to the three provisions already mentioned the following features : ( d ) insurance against disability or invalidity , beginning ten years earlier than under the present rules ( p. 45 ) ; ( e ) life insurance for the period between entrance upon the profession and retirement under the old-age pension provision . Furthermore , the whole arrangement is to be put upon a contractual footing . These additional forms of protection are , assuredly , eminently desirable things for the younger teacher . They cover risks graver  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more immediately disquieting  --  than the risk of poverty in old age . For the latter , some provision can , with thrift , be gradually accumulated ; and nearly all men in youth believe themselves capable of the requisite thrift . But the accidents of early disability or of the early death of the head of a family often create bitterly tragic situations , in the case of men who had been unable , out of their own meagre salaries , to carry adequate insurance . Ifthe Carnegie Foundation were really offering to add these advantages to the benefits previously promised by it , it would very notably increase the attractiveness and security of the scholar 's career . There is , however , a singular and conspicuous fly in the ointment which Mr. Pritchett proffers , after his deep and kindly ponderings upon " social philosophy " in general , and the needs of university teachers in particular . The forms of insurance now outlined are , indeed , more extensive and therefore more desirable than the old ; only it is not the Foundation which , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Pritchett proposes is to transfer all of the cost of the old retiring-allowances , and most of the cost of the new insurance system ' , from the treasury of the Foundation to the private pocketbooks of the " beneficiaries . " It is true that he suggests that the colleges should pay half the cost of the annuities from their corporate funds . But this , in most institutions , is an unlikely , certainly a remote , consummation ; and in any case Mr. Pritchett himself points out with emphasis ( pp. 34 , 54 ) that all such pension grants would be paid far , in the long run , by the teachers , through the foregoing of otherwise possible increases of salary . While certain contributions from the Foundation are proposed , these form a very small part of the whole . Hereafter  --  if the plan is adapted  --  the retiring-allowances hitherto given by the Foundation will be purchased by teachers as " annuities , " at rates based upon ordinary actuarial calculations ; and the new life-insurance benefit is similarly to be paid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wisconsin faculty committee shows that , for life-insurance and annuities together , better terms can already be obtained from commercial companies than are proposed in Mr. Pritchett 's plan . The participation of the Foundation , as outlined , will consist chiefly of three features : ( 1 . ) It will bear the whole cost of the disability insurance . The insurance of this sort which is offered is , however , very narrowly restricted . It is to be available only to those who have served twenty years ( or fifteen , if wholly in professorial grades ) and hold contracts for life insurance and annuity . Though apparently no commercial company writes so peculiar a policy as this , it is estimated by an actuary who has been good enough to advise me upon the point that such insurance , for the sum suggested ( $1,200 ) , could be purchased ( beginning at age thirty ) for a net annual premium of about three dollars ; or , to the amount of the average present retiring allowance ' ( $1,700 ) , for less than five dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 41/s per cent . on the sums paid in by professors , " unless the current rate of interest should be permanently lowered . " This is , of course , a negligible consideration . In the words of a distinguished actuary , " practically no well-managed American company has ever earned a net rate of interest of less than 41/2 per cent over any extended period , and it is almost certain that this condition , which has continued over half a century , will hold for many years to come . " ( 3 . ) The Foundation will carry the expense of administration , " if this is not supported by the surplus " of the fund contributed by others , and will pay taxes on premiums . The value of this contingent offer is difficult to estimate . The " load " really necessary to cover this expense has been found , in the experience of some commercial insurance companies , to be less than 10 per cent . of the premiums . Assuming that this amount would in fact be furnished by the Foundation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " typical professor " mentioned by Mr. Pritchett ( p. 31 ) , it would seem that the Foundation 's total Contribution per teacher , in terms of annual cost or premium value , would be approximately $40 ; while the annual direct and indirect contribution of the teacher would amount to about $360 . In the case of the maximum retiring-allowance , the annual cost to the teacher ( or president ) would be above $600 , the contribution of the Foundation less than $75 . The value ( estimated , for a typical instance , upon the basis of tables furnished by Mr. Pritchett in his report ) of the benefits promised teachers in accepted institutions by the present rules is at least four times the value of all benefits which it is proposed that the Foundation shall hereafter provide . According to the carefully considered opinion of the Wisconsin committee , " the advantages of the new plan over commercial insurance would be so slight as to offer no substantial inducement " to any college professor to participate in. the scheme . It is to be observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all teachers must be made compulsory , in any institution which is to benefit by the Foundation 's offers . In other words , the teacher will not only pay most of the cost of any benefits he receives , but also , in order to obtain employment , he must , willy-nilly , agreo to regular deductions from his salsa-Y , to be paid into the insurance and annuity fund  --  whether or not he needs insurance , or is already insured , or can afford the premium , or has access to more advantageous opportunities for investment , or regards a corporation " controlled by the Foundation " ( p. 50 ) as a safe and satisfactory depository for his insurance payments . A reading of President Pritchett 's report , it may incidentally be remarked , produces the impression that the present management of the Foundation is peculiarly ill qualified to direct the affairs of an insurance company . To such small dimensions will shrink the Foundation 's contribution to the " attractive . ness of the teaching profession , " if Mr. Pritchett 's proposals are adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rert- *In the case of one class of teachers , the possibility of more substantial benefits for a limited period is suggested . In so far as the above-mentioned expenditures " should not absorb the income of the Foundation , " Mr. Pritchett suggests that the surplus be devoted to " as-der the Foundation almost completely ineffective for the purpose for which it was originally created ; for it is certain that there is nothing in the benefits mentioned which will appreciably tend " to better the profession and attract into it increasing numbers of strong men . " Strong men are likely to prefer to remain free from compulsion , even at the cost of paying , in some cases , a little more for the insurance they may carry . If it were , avowedly , chill penury which thus early represses the noble rage with which the Foundation began , there would be nothing more to say , so far as the future is concerned  --  though much would deserve to be said concerning the past management of the munificent gift which Mr. Carnegie placed in the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it is certain that the Foundation 's resources will , unless it receives a large increase of its endowment , be insufficient for an indefinite continuance of the present plan , it is not frankly as a measure of retrenchment that Mr. Pritchett presents his new project . It is , in fact , as a measure of expansion that he presents it . His purpose is to outline a " sound pension system available not only to the colleges at present associated with the Foundation , but available also to the great body of college teachers . " The essence of the plan is , in short , to spread the Foundation 's income so thin over so large an area that the advantages ( not otherwise obtainable ) which it will bring to any individual must be so slight as to be almost negligible  --  and will certainly be quite insufficient to constitute , for any intelligent man , an economic inducement to embrace the profession of the teacher and scientific investigator . Such a policy is , of course , the sure road to futility for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is finite . Let it be supposed that Mr. Henry Ford has a surplus of ten million dollars which he wishes to give away ; and that he has twenty thousand employees . If he adds $500 a year to the wages of each of these , upon condition of the attainment of a certain level of efficiency , he accomplishes three probably useful results : he substantially improves the material condition of twenty thousand families ; he stimulates industry and skill ; and he creates some tendency , on the part of other employers competing for skilled labor , to offer higher wages . But if Mr. Ford feels that he must be " comprehensive " in his beneficence , he will divide his surplus equally among the entire population of the country . In that event , each of us will receive ten cents  --  and nobody will be appreciably the better off . In short , the first and lusting colleges now outside of the accepted list in the matter of their accrued liabilities " ? i. e. , to aiding such colleges to give to their older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance for which the younger men would be paying Such aid  --  conditioned , in any case , upon the doubtful financial codperataon of these colleges  --  would necessarily terminate with the discharge of these accrued liabilities . It would not , therefore , be a permanent part of the Foundation 's activity Moreover , the proposal is part of a general policy of extension and dilution of the advantages offered by the Foundation ; upon this policy comment is made below . most elementary rule for the effective expenditure of any such fund is that it be not scattered in a multitude of petty grants , but be applied , at any given time , to the production of some definite and substantial benefit to a limited number of beneficiaries ; and that it also be so used that , either by example or by its effect upon the conditions of competition , it may cause others to multiply , out of their own resources , the number of such benefits . The more restricted the resources of the Foundation in the future , the more important it is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt , be applied in practice in more than one way . Probably the wisest way would be to devote the Foundation 's income to giving , from time to time , substantial lump sums to colleges of high standing ? perhaps only to one each year or two  --  on condition that , with this aid , they establish pension systems of their own , or raise their scale of salaries . The likelihood of cooperation on the part of the colleges would , of course , depend a good deal upon the amount of the inducement and assistance the Foundation was able to offer . Such cooperation in the undertaking at present proposed by Mr. Pritchett is especially unlikely , because the Foundation offers so little . But if it should offer the amount of a whole year 's income , or more , now to this , now to that institution , on the condition specified , it would doubtless find some response ; and each pension system established would make it more difficult for other colleges , desirous of obtaining the abler sort of men for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same plan would enable the Foundation to continue a genuine and notable service to American education which it has hitherto been rendering , by using its benefits as a leverage for raising the standards of scholarship in the colleges . By such a policy much could , in the course of half a century , be done to enhance the attractiveness , increase the security , and raise the efficiency of the academic profession . One concluding remark must be added , though the necessity for it is to be regretted . It is evident that no new rules ( however desirable in themselves ) which may be adopted by the Foundation can either expediently or honorably be given a retroactive effect  --  that is , be regarded as annulling obligations to individuals or institutions imposed upon the Foundation by its present rules , taken in their natural sense . There is , however , an ominous sentence in Mr. Pritchett 's report which seems to indicate that , to him , this principle is not wholly evident . While protesting that " the trustees will meet to the utmost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he adds : It will require a number of years to change from the one system to the other . The actuaries have suggested that men below the age of forty-five could to their own advantage transfer from the one system to the other . Whether twenty years is a reasonable notification of a change in the rules is a matter which will be considered in the most serious and conscientious manner by the trustees . The last sentence , of course , refers to the period between forty-five and sixty-five , at which age the retiring allowances become payable under the present rules . What is really suggested here is the possibility of the withdrawal of all expectation of these pensions from men under forty-five , with no notice at all , beyond the publication of Mr. Pritchett 's pamphlet . The intimation that this withdrawal may be to the pecuniary interest of the teachers affected can not be taken seriously . The value  --  measured by the annual premiums which would be necessary in order to purchase them  --  of the present annuity and disability benefits , greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only one of appreciable amount being , moreover , problematical  --  which are to be offered by the Foundation in their place , according to President Pritchett 's new project. * The passage cited , therefore , illuminated as it is by some previous incidents in the history of the Foundation , leads one to suppose that Mr. Pritchett 's mind is not altogether clear upon the question whether a corporation may , without breach of faith , abruptly withdraw from men in middle life the assurance of benefits , upon the expectation of which it has for ten years been inviting these men to base their provision for old age , their scale of protection for their dependents , and their general standard of living ; whether , above all , this may properly be done by a corporation professedly designed to increase the security of the teacher 's calling ! The Carnegie Foundation would be converted into a sorry jest , indeed , at the expense of the majority of the present body of teachers in most of the principal American universities and colleges , if the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cited , should be adopted by the trustees . Nor do the moral obligations of the Foundation stop short of the fulfilment of all that is promised by its present rules , in the case of even the youngest man now upon the teaching staff of any " accepted institution . " Mr. Pritchett appears to deem it especially unreasonable that men only a year or two in the profession should be thought to have any claim upon the Foundation 's consideration . Yet in equity these men would , if that were possible , have even a better claim than those who were already engaged in teaching when the Foundation was established . For the Foundation , as has been shown , has from the beginning presented itself as offering young men of ability a material inducement to embrace the teaching profession , rather than some other . Consequently , all those entering the profession since the offer was made must , by the Foundation , be presumed to have been in some degree influenced by that inducement . Yet Mr. Pritchett is apparently unable to see that a body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of others to be influenced , is morally bound to make its promises good to all who have by their action accepted those offers  --  even though the president of the corporation should in the meantime change his " social philosophy . " The entire work of the Foundation has , of course , been based upon Its promises ; its distinctive business has been to effect certain results in the present ( r. e. , at any given time ) by causing people to believe that it would do certain things in the future ( i. e. , at a specified subsequent time ) . Nothing short of an uberrima fides can befit the character of an institution of whose activity this promissory or expectation-creating function is the very essence . Fortunately , it can not be supposed that the trustees contemplate action of the sort which President Pritchett hints at . They have adopted a resolution expressing the intention of avoiding any " unfairness to the just expectations of institutions or individuals under the present rules . " If this resolution is construed in the only sense which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the changes in the Foundation 's rules which the future may prove inevitable will be given any retroactive application .
