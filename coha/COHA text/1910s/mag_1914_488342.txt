Count von Bernstorff 's assurance that Germany will not consent to waive her right to invade Canada because of the Monroe Doctrine need keep no one awake o'nights , either here or in the Dominion . A little trifle like the British fleet still stands in the way . But ' this harmless intellectual exercise of conquering oversea domain . by fancy is being indulged in on all sides . There are no doubt Germans in plenty who firmly believe that their troops will enter London ere long . Was there not a rumor a little while ago that fifty armored lighters are being built at Kiel , each to carry 500 Prussians of the expeditionary force which is to hunt Kitchener in his lair as soon as the German submarines have disposed of Jellicoe 's remaining ships ? Do we not read that submarine transports are being built ? In England the most popular game is still that of dividing up the German Empire . Seriously speaking , it is wise of the Germans to make it clear that they have not thought of seeking South American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a great deal of loose talk to this effect going the rounds  --  that we shall " have Germany on our necks if she wins . " Every assurance which she can give that this will not be her policy , if it is based on something more definite than a scrap of paper , will be to her advantage . How immense is the task of relieving the war-stricken in even England appears from the difficulty of organizing all the agencies of assistance , private and governmental . At their head stands the Cabinet Committee administering the Prince of Wales 's  --  now the National Relief ? Fund , which works through local citizens ' committees formed in every district of 20,000 population . Government measures have been taken to prevent its plans Overlapping those of the Soldiers ' and Saliors ' Families ' Relief Association , and those of the Poor Law and National Insurance authorities . But there is already serious complaint that it has not availed of the knowledge and energy of the thousands of well-equipped societies which deal year in and year out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to redoubled effort by the crisis  --  the Charity Organization Society , the Church Army , - the Board of Guardians , the Children 's Aid Association , and so on . In many localities these have formed Bureaus of Personal Service to cooperate with the Cabinet Committee 's organization ; in others they have complamed bitterly of the maladjustment of relief . In addition , there are bodies like the Queen 's Employment Committee , with its fund to establish workrooms ; and the disorganized activities of hundreds of localities in providing special road and building schemes , 600 of which were submitted for government approval between August 4 and September 21 alone . The country not only faces the present dislocation of employment , the care of widows and orphans , the congestion of hospitals , but must look forward to such tremendous problems as the re-absorption of a huge army into industry at the war 's end  --  a process miserable and disheartening even after the Boer War . Congress , which adjourned on Saturday , holds its record as the longest continuous sitting ? of the legislative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined , it has been at its post since April 7 , 1913 ? about eighteen and one-half months , or 550 days . The most protracted regular session previously on record  --  excluding one which was interrupted by very lengthy recesses  --  was that extending from December 3 , 1849 , to September 30 , 1850 , or 302 days . It was occupied with the Compromise Measure , it heard four great speeches by Clay , Webster , Calhoun , and Seward , and there joined in its debates Benton , Hale , Douglas , Jefferson Davis , and Salmon P. Chase . No piece of oratory of the present session will rank with the Seventh of March speech . As for special sessions , there have been nineteen in the period from 1789 to 1913 , lasting from ten days to eight months each  --  but very few over six months . Not many Presidents have cared to assume the responsibilities they involve . It is to be pointed out that but for the length of the first regular session of the Sixty-second Congress , December 4 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thirty years , the mark now set by the combined sessions would be still more striking . The full report of Secretary McAdoo on the receipts from individuals under the in-. come tax from March 1 to December 31 , 1913 , is in many respects surprising . The yield is certainly much less than Most observers had expected . In his annual report to Congress a year ago , the Secretary predicted an income of $54,000,000 from individuals under the tax , and despite the manifest elements of uncertainty in any calculation , many thought that it should produce more . It was a heavy reduction from the yield of over $80,000,000 upon which the Congressmen who drew up the bill had counted . Last July , again , upon the completion of the task of collection , the Secretary issued another estimate to the effect that the receipts would approximate $31,000,000 . Surprising as this was , the full returns now show the amount to be actually about $28,000,000 . The Secretary 's original estimate is almost halved , and that of Congress nearly cut in three . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue , for but 357,598 were made , though Congress , in its $80,000,000 estimate , had counted upon half a million . Yet it is to be remembered that all estimates were purely conjectural , the uncollected income tax of 1894 having offered no guide to the law 's productiveness . The Internal Revenue Bureau promises a report upon the delinquents , of whom it is thought there are many ; but the discrepancy between expectation and result is so great that delinquency can at most account for but a part of the miscalculation . The formal announcement by the Treasury Department that the new regional banks will be opened November 16 foreshadows events with a highly interesting bearing on our troubled financial situation . It is now evident  --  as it was , indeed , to thoughtful students of the question when the new system was planned  --  that an important function of the regional banks will be that of leadership in matters of banking policy . Every one familiar with the history of our financial panics ' knew that on such occasions the existence of a powerful central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its district and exercising organizational supervision over them , would insure the maximum of efficiency in dealing with the crisis . The present situation could not possibly have been foreseen ; yet no situation can be imagined in which precisely this centralized authority and power woud be more urgently needed . Laborious voluntary effort of a few individuals or institutions has succeeded in organizing such " emergency relief movements " as the $100,000,000 fund contributed by New York banks to protect this city 's foreign engagements , and the $100 , - 000,000 fund for regulating the exchange market , in which the larger banks throughout the country joined . Now , in the same unofficial way , the problem of financing a partly unsalable cotton crop is being dealt with . It needs no argument to show how much more effectively all this could be done with the regional banks and the national board in full operation . The rejection by the House , as well as the Senate , of the plan to relieve the cotton exigency by a $250,000,000 issue of Government bonds , can not bitterly disappoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; while , in spite'of all that the Georgia and Alabama members said of the " Macedonian cry " from their sections , it is hard to believe that the better judgment of a large part of the Southern people was not really against the proposal . The six Southern Governors who met recently to agree upon legislation limiting the cotton-growing area or encouraging other crops , took no desperate view of the necessity for Federal relief , and there are Southern newspapers that have opposed it . Part of the support it has had in Congress was sincere , but a large part was admittedly political . It must be hoped that any who believed in it received a clear lesson by the vote and the unequivocal debate in Congress , and that the South at large will understand that its best part is to help itself and not to come to Congress for special privileges . Congressman Glass , of Virginia , to whom much of the credit for defeating the bill is to be given , repeatedly emphasized his judgment that " we already have upon the statute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banking and Currency Committee , are sufficient to relieve the situation " ; and everything now indicates the success of the proposed bankers ' cotton pool . We know that the Republican party can not change its spots , because the Colonel has so stated . Only an academic interest , accordingly , attaches to Chairman Hilles 's announcement that the plan proposed last December for reducing the Southern representation in national Republican conventions has been adopted , through its ratification by conventions in States that cast a majority of votes in the present Electoral College . The Convention of 1916 will have 89 fewer delegates than the Convention of 1912 , and most of this loss will be in the delegations from the South . It is noteworthy that the South itself has accepted the reduction , Texas being the only State to vote against it ; her loss will be sixteen delegates , twice the loss of any other State . The only Northern State to lose in representation is New York , and it loses ; but two delegates . Chairman Hines is at pains to point out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which many States constantly contended , was the legacy of years and of political custom , and therefore not in any way identified with the Convention of 1912 . " Not a word about the real objection to it , that itstood in the way of an ex-President 's ambi-tion ! The American Bar Association disposed of the question of admitting negroes to membership by a resolution providing that in submitting lists of candidates for membership , the local councils shall give information as to the race , sex , and any other matters pertaining to the candidates that are required by the Executive Committee of the Association . This saves the Association from the stigma of drawing a racial line , even if it makes it possible to reject a candidate upon that ground alone . This action followed the adoption of a resolution submitted by Moorfield Storey , repealing the resolution of two years ago declaring that it was not contemplated that colored men should be admitted to membership . The Association is to be congratulated upon extricating itself from a most discreditable position , and one that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressman V.are 's attack upon Senator Penrose in the House , calling upon him to deny categorically the authenticity of the " information " from Penrose on which the Philadelphia North American bases charges concerning Vare 's alleged use of bribes in 1911 , revives a feud that will make Pennsylvania Democrats jubilant . The quarrel may be only temporary , for a general denial has already come from Penrose , and the Republicans will put forth every effort to reconcile the two leaders . The following of Vare is more personal than partisan ; if Penrose can not prove misstatement on the part of the North American , and Vare carries his resentment to an extreme , he should cut down the inevitable Penrose majority in Philadelphia by 40,000 or 50,000 . The North American charges that , in an effort to help that journal defeat Vare 's nomination in 1911 , Penrose " made the most astounding and specific charges of corruption to which we have ever listened , bluntly naming as the corrupters . . . his own political and business associates ! ' A few days before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resort to the recall are so few that discussion of the device is still limited in the main to general considerations . California has just furnished an example of its use , however , which should be added to the list . Two years ago , at the last State election , a Senator was chosen by a narrow majority of the reform as opposed to the machine adherents . He took a firmstand at Sacramento against vice and kindred evils , not only upon general grounds , but also because of the approaching Exposition . The climax of his activity in this direction was reached by his introduction of a bill to abate the " redlight " conditions in San Francisco . A movement was started to recall him . The petition received the requisite number of signatures , and at the election he was defeated by an open champion of the interests that he had been fighting . The significant feature of the affair is that only half of the registered voters went to the special election ; naturally , the interests antagonized were represented in good numbers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if they approved of the course of their Senator , to go to the polls and vote to re-tain him . But it is matter of common ob-servation that special elections do not re-ceive the attention that is paid to regular ones . This particular election strengthens the position of those who hold that the recall tends to operate against the man in office , especially if he has been the exponent of a vigorous policy . The notable celebration of the thirty-fifth anniversary of Thomas A. Edison 's perfection of the incandescent lamp is gratifying evidence that Americans are beginning properly to take note of events in the lives of their men of science during their lifetime . Who can measure the world 's debt to Mr. Edison for his development of the electric light and the complete revolution in illumination which it has brought about ? The amazing thing about it all is that these elec. trical.wonders , including the trolley-car and electric train , have become universal so quickly . The increase in comfort due to the incandescent light no one of the younger generation can understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day to the old gaslight , everybody would appreciate in fullest degree just what the " Wizard of Menlo Park " has accomplished in this field . As it is , the modest inventor will be grateful , no doubt , for the evidences of public appreciation so widely displayed . There is something inspiring in every phase of Mr. Edison 's life , but best of all is his absolute devotion to his work , his refusal to splurge , or to be exploited , and his intense desire to confer other lasting benefits upon his fellowmen . Time has still left the country a handful of forty-niners ; but those who were connected with the picturesque early history of the West are fast passing . Of this the death of a character immortalized in " Roughing It " has just reminded California . Calvin H. Higbie , civil engineer and miner , and long a partner of the humorist , figures in the story and in its dedication . There are two good reasons for believing that he was peculiarly fitted for companionship with Mark Twain . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one large fortune , was full of hopeful , adventurous Americanism ; and to Paine 's biography of Clemens he was persuaded to contribute a few lines that betoken an appreciative spirit . Speaking of Mark Twain 's enjoyment of the pleasures of a " great ball " at Aurora , he wrote : In changing partners , whenever he saw a hand raised he would grasp it with great pleasure and sail off into another set , oblivious to his surroundings . Sometimes he would act as though there were no use in trying to go right or to dance like other people , and with his eyes closed he would do a hoe-down or a double-shuffie all alone , talking to himself and saying that he never dreamed there was so much pleasure to be obtained at a ball . It was all as natural as a child 's play . By the second set , all the ladies were falling over themselves to get him for a partner , and most of the crowd , too full of mirth to dance , were standing or sitting around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to have been chum to Mark Twain , a Western periodical explains , was not to have lived in vain . The Hartford Courant is celebrating the completion of a hundred and fifty years of continuous existence under one name . In this respect , it has a unique place in American journalism . Founded on October 29 , 1764 , it has lived to see the end of the eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries and the opening of the twentieth . Yet this distinguished record does not make it the oldest daily newspaper in the country . The Courant started as a weekly , and did not become a daily until 1837 , the year of Queen Victoria 's accession . At that time , Boston , New York , Philadelphia , and Baltimore all had old daily newspapers . One of these , the Pennsylvania Gazette , which was owned for a while by Franklin , had been started as a weekly as early as 1729 ; the Maryland Journal and Baltimore Advertiser , now the Baltimore American , had its first issue in 1773 ; the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minerva by Noah Webster , and the Evening Post had first seen the light in 1801 . All of these , with the exception of the last-named , have undergone changes of name , and the oldest of them was absorbed by the Philadelphia North American in 1845 ? not the present enterprising sheet of that name , but its predecessor . He who coins a word is greater than he who bombarded Rheims Cathedral . It must have been a genius who invented " to fashionize . " It leaped from his brain when cotton became the craze . At least , we are told it is the craze . The Southern Society is going to dance in it . A perfectly new bride in her first attempt at matrimony will walk to the altar arrayed in it ; the Women 's New York Democratic Club , always by principle inclined to simplicity , will henceforth urge other women to wear it . " Pretty , " " inexpensive , " " lasting , " " patriotic " precede the noun , even when purists write of the product of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praise , this wooing accomplish its purpose ? Will the farmers rid themselves of the obnoxious stuff ? There is one way , and only one , to " fashionize " cotton . If it is done by society , Hoke Smith may stop filibustering . But there must be no doubt as to its being the real Society . The amiable daughters of Queen Victoria wrapped themselves from crown to sole in Irish lace to further Irish industry , and the student of history will remember that one married the grandson of a shoemaker and another one of her Majesty 's subjects , and that in time a large appropriation ( see George Birmingham ) had to be made for wharves on the Irish coast , where there was no necessity for wharves . Yet the daughters of the Queen were not Society . That body , tiny , exclusive , remote , has never lacked judgment or taste . It is to it the Southern farmer should cotton . Nobody has a kind word for the Huns . The name is the last word in vituperation . England applies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cossacks . Presumably the Austrians apply it to the Serbs , unless Vienna is held back by the thought that a very large part of the Hapsburg dominions bears the name of Hungary . The name is used loosely to denote every Asiatic enemy who from time to time has threatened the integrity of European civilization ? Huns , Arabs , Turks . In this latter sense it is especially favored by the Kaiser 's people , whose Patriotic poets have drawn parallels between the great battle of 451 near Chalons , in which Attila was done for , and the battle of the Masur Lakes , in which von Hindenburg did for the Slavic hordes about two months ago . Thus , while the British use Huns as a sign of temper , the German nation characteristically imparts to the name a philosophico-historical significance . To be sure , the practice involves certain ethnographical difficulties . The battle of CMions was foughtin France ; where is the appropriateness of the citation in a German mouth ? So we must remember that the inhabitants of France in 451 were Franks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman Aetius took part in the battle , the fact is overlooked in the heat of polemic . Actually there is a great deal of nonsense about this claim of one European nation or another to have served as the bulwark of western civilization against the Asiatic peril . At any rate , the Teutons are in no position to assert a monopoly . If one recalls rightly , it was a Visigoth  --  that is , a Teuton  --  by the name of Count Julian , who invited the Arabs into Spain . Historians now generally admit that it was the Byzantines  --  a race whom German patriot historians of the Houston Stewart Chamberlain type particularly despise  --  who did valiant service on the European frontier against the Saracen and Turk for a thousand years . It was a Slavic peril by the name of John Sobieski who shattered the Turkish power at the gates of Vienna . And Turkey to-day is a good friend of the Kaiser . Why drag in the Asiatic ? The dispatch from Petrograd that the Czar has assured the Russian Union of Abstinence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Russia the sale of alcoholic drinks by the Government " scarcely means that one-seventh of the habitable globe will pass under permanent prohibition . Various measures , it is true , have stopped the sale of liquor in Russia since the war began ; and Count Witte , uncompromising foe of the Government monopoly , hails the Czar 's announcement as meaning that " naturally after the war is finished these measures should be developed in the direction of permanent prohibition . " That radical steps will be taken to limit the consumption of alcohol is certain , for the Government showed months ago that it had taken to heart the evils growing out of excessive drinking . But to talk of absolute prohibition is to forget that drinking has for generations had its hold on the population , and that the taking over of control of the distilleries in 1895 was with the object of checking it . That object was forgotten , and the output of the distilleries has increased more than 10,000,000 gallons in the last five years . The best method of slowly bringing the liquor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the abolition of the Government retail shops in favor of a careful license system , with the retention of Government control over the distilleries , so as to limit their operations .
