txt GUNDA . Varied Comments from ' Times Readers on His Plight -- Buffalo 's Remedy . Let the Bronx Park officials follow the course taken by the City of Buffalo , N. Y. , In caring for their elephant . When " Big Frank " outgrew his quarters and began to show signs of ugliness , on account of being chained up , the city authorities , with very little delay , provided a new house , surrounded with a good-sized yard into which he could go and come at will . A swimming pool in the yard provides both comfort anti pleasure , and the elephant is now happy and contented . If the City of Buffalo can provide such quarters for its animals , surely New York can do so . It seems incredible that the people would permit the treatment of Gunder to continue as long as it has . If these animals must be kept in captivity , in the name of humanity let them be properly cared for .
