HOW many people who read these lines are satisfied that they are filling their appropriate place in the world ? How many believe that they are doing the particular work for which their talents and inclinations fit them ? How many feel that there are other Things which , if they were once given a chance , they could do much better ? How many believe that their careers are the result of a wellordered , thought-out scheme , and how many realize that their present occupation is all pure accident ? The man who is doing the thing which he planned as a boy or young man is the rarest phe-nomenon . The human being who can deliberately set his goal and advance unwaveringly toward it has determination , almost genius , of a high order . Every one of us has some one thing which he can do better than anything else ; in some one undiscovered particular we are all supermen . How many of us are doing that one thing ? Questions like these , which most people constantly ask themselves , are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' which leads the average citizen to quarrel with his lot seldom assumes the proportions of a tragedy ; but there are millions of flesh-and-blood ghosts who haunt the purlieus of modern enterprise ? men and women who never seem to find an economic affinity . American industry is now searching its heart in the interest of these industrial waifs . To what extent are the manufacturer and business yman themselves responsible for the misfit ? To what extent does the misfit present the possibility of cure ? The latest development of scientific management is Its attempt to solve this problem , to use profitably the vast amount of human material which is constantly going to waste . For several years the efficiency experts have been preaching and practising their art . They have shown manufacturers how to buy to advantage , how to economize in the processes of production , and how to use every last ounce of inert material . According to the prevailing idea , they have made great contributions to modern industrialism ; however , so far , they have touched only one side , perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the spigot , but they have paid too little attention to the loss at the bunghole . Industrial students now recognize the important fact that the greatest waste of industrialism is not in its dead , but in its living substance . Steel , iron , and leather belting do not make a factory prosperous and efficient ; the brains and muscles that control these inanimate forces spell success or failure . Modern efficiency shows us how to use the machinery and pig-iron to the best advantage , but only recently has it tackled the important question of how to handle men and women . It uses every ounce of iron and every pound of steam , but it casts thousands of human beings on the scrap-heap as valueless . The beef trust tells us that it utilizes every part of its carcasses . It markets the edible parts as food ; other sections of the animal ultimately appear as buttons , purses , glue , shoes , combs , hairpins , and soap . In carving up a pig , the Chicago packers proudly , say , ' We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar problem ; but why does industrialism select only the most promising elements ? Why does it necessarily disregard the inefficient , the untrained , the down and out , " the discouraged , the vicious , possibly even the criminal ? Ordinary common sense teaches us that there is something which these men and women can do . Most factories have expert salesmen , expert purchasing agents , expert financiers , expert designers ; how many ? until recently ? have had experts in human labor ? When it is said that this neglected majority constitutes a frightful waste , statistics eloquently bear out the statement . There is probably not a large employer of labor in the United States who will question it . " Hiring and firing , " all now recognize , forms the greatest leakage in modern business . In many establishments the men who do the employing have come to be known as " the fortune-tellers . " It is the one place in which everything is haphazard . Mr. Magnus W. Alexander , one of the engineers of the General Electric Company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistics of twelve metal factories , located in six States , he has found that these places employed 37,274 persons at the beginning of the year , and 43,971 at the end . Their normal increase in employees , therefore , was 6,697 . Had matters worked efficiently , these factories should have employed only 6,697 men ? or slightly more , making due allowance for death , sickness , and other natural causes of dismissal . In reality , these factories had hired 45,571 new people . We must ponder these figures carefully to get their full significance . In order to obtain 6,000 new employees , these establishments , all representative and " efficient " American concerns , had to employ 45,000l Out of seven men taken on , only one stayed . After making liberal deductions , Mr. Alexander calculates that these twelve factories employed 24,50o men and women whom they were unable to retain . Each person represented an expense ranging from $50 to $zoo . The companies had to keep a clerical force to hire these people and place their names on the pay-roll . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had to stand the expense of damaged and broken tools due to inexperience . The reduced rate of production represented another positive loss , and then there was the spoiled work which " new hands " turn out in such abundance . Mr. Alexander takes the lowest estimate , $50 per man , as representing this loss . At this rate , " hiring and firing " caused a waste in VOL . CXXXIV. ? No. 799. -9 these twelve factories of nearly $1,000 , - coo a year . At the highest estimate , $200 , the practice resulted in a waste of $4,000,000 . Eighty-five per cent . of the human material that went into these shops failed to adapt itself to the machine . This experience is universal . One manufacturer reports that , in order to get fifty employees , he has hired 1,000 men during a single year . This reduced his profits , he says , by $15o,000 . A Cleveland factory employed 75o girls , and kept only 175 of them Only great prosperity can stand such losses . They mean the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the difference between solvency and insolvency . To any one really interested in efficiency , the situation is appalling . What does the saving in a few " waste motions " ? even a new method of laying bricks ? amount to in comparison with these losses ? Nor is the industrial waste the most serious aspect ; think of the human tragedies that these statistics disclose . In these twelve establishments 35,000 men out of 45,000 have failed to make good . Imagine the strain that the great unassimilated make upon the other resources of society ? the extent to which they burden friends , relations , and philanthropic organizations . It is incredible that all these men , or even a large majority , arc to blame . Only the most hopeless pessimist can think that such an enormous percentage of human beings are worthless . Industrialism has a name for the unsuccessful one ; he is the " floater , " or " five-day man . " He is the man who travels from one factory town to another , frequently on the bumpers ; he strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five days , gets a few dollars pay and vanishes into space . In a week or two he turns up in another place and repeats the performance . In many cases this man is dissipated , a congenital tramp ; in thousands of instances he is merely an inefficient human being who has gone astray . He is , indeed , one of the commonest human characters . We find him not only in the factory and the shop ; we meet him in all branches of social and industrial life . We find him in the office , the club , in our college class , in all the learned professions . 1 . here are few families , whatever their social station , that do not possess at least one representative of this class . Indeed , to some extent we are nearly all " misfits . " Drifting , not steering , is apparently the principle that regulates most lives . A glance into any office or factory discloses the wildest inconsistencies . Men physically frail are trying to do heavy manual work simply because they lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beefy men , deliberate and judicial in temperament , who might do well as butchers , are trying to fill executive positions . There are others tingling with activity whom fate has chained down to sedentary jobs . Good fortune has placed others , who might have done well as doorkeepers , in positions of authority . There are men who have n't the industry to qualify for mental work , but arc too proud to earn a living with their hands . There are others who are full of ambition for commercial success , but who display a hopeless impracticability at every turn . Men aspire to literary fame who are too lazy mentally to learn the rules of grammar and punctuation . Proud parents make doctors and lawyers of boys who could have had useful careers as farmers . Plenty of schoolteachers ought to be wearing overalls ; there are thousands of clerks , salesmen , and other members of the " white-collar " squad who would have done splendidly as carpenters and bricklayers . All offices have detail men doing executive work and executive men doing detail work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factories Mr. Alexander studied , the same conglomeration of misfits prevails . No one has studied ? they themselves least of all ? the inclinations and abilities of the men ; no one knows why they fail . The foreman puts a man at a skilled job who is really only capable of handling pig-iron . He sets a girl with defective eves working at a task that demands the keenest vision . Because she fails , the foreman " fires her " ; had he merely called in an oculist , she would have been transformed into an efficient employee . Mr. C. B. Lord , General Superintendent of The Wagner Electric &; Manufacturing Co. , believes that eighty per cent . of these failures are really ambitious to make good ; they fail simply because there is no intelligent effort made to utilize them . One of the largest manufacturing concerns in New York State recently gave all the employees a physical examination . The results were fairly astounding . Deaf girls were serving as telephoneoperators . Men with heart disease were doing work that required them constantly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were employed in the heaviest tasks . Workmen with deficient muscular co-ordination were blundering along with jobs requiring the finest manual skill . And this examination touched only the most obvious physical qualities . If the investigators had had instruments that would have recorded mental aptitudes , one can only imagine what absurdities they would have disclosed . The fact that there are scattered instances in which the misfit , after floating around for several years , suddenly discovers his vocation , shows that the situation is not hopeless . Nearly everybody can remember cases of this kind . One of our greatest advertising men made his beginning in life as an unsuccessful preacher . An eminent efficiency engineer spent several unhappy preliminary years as a college professor . I know a man whose father insisted that he become a lawyer . He failed at this , took to drink , and was rapidly qualifying for the scrap-heap . His natural liking was for the open air , and the closed atmosphere of a lawyer 's office simply stifled all his energies . Some one advised him to buy a fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work and developed great earning capacity . Another old misfit is now the vice-president of a large automobile company . Ten years ago he was a member of the " floating " class , puttering away at the job of an unskilled laborer . The man really - had great executive and financial ability ; only the barest chance put him in the way of utilizing it . Though every one can recall instances of this kind , what we do n't always recognize is that these are sporadic cases ? a few instances of misfits who have accidentally been steered in the right direction . But the great majority arc submerged . " What was your first job ? " an employer recently asked one of these . " My first job was several places , " ? an answer that went deep into this great social problem . " I ca n't touch that machine again ! " a man once said , appealingly , to his foreman . " I am afraid of it . I shall spoil some of the goods , injure some of my fellow-workmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , industrious person , and the firm concluded that he needed a vacation . When he went back to the old machine , however , he broke down again . The man was simply a misfit . I Iis talents were executive , not mechanical . He was tried as a sub-boss ; he now holds an important managerial office , earning ten times the pay of the old position . Only the accidental thoughtfulness of his employer enabled him to discover the thing that he could do . But many industrial establishments are now attempting to reduce employ-i ment to a science . The central idea is to use such talents as a man possesses . i The great modern quest is to get greater efficiency out of the efficient and to get efficiency out of the thousands hitherto cast aside as inefficient . Twentiethcentury industrialism has finally attacked its greatest problem ? how to use all that is in its human material " except the squeal . " The largest industrial plants , in all parts of the country , are now establishing employment departments . In the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and firing . " It was a prerogative which he jealously guarded . However , he seldom performed his duty with much skill or intelligence . He was notoriously a person of likes and dislikes ; he had no system , beyond a few crudely asked questions ; appraising human nature was not usually his strongest point . Prejudice entered largely into his choice of underlings ; not infrequently he was venal , demanding a bribe as a prerequisite to giving a job , and securing pay increases on condition that he obtained a percentage . But this old-fashioned foreman is rapidly losing his power . In hundreds of our largest establishments he now does no " hiring or firing " at all . The modern employ-ment superintendent has succeeded this functionary . This office , usually having a large staff , passes candidates for all positions through its hands . Foremen , when they need steel , iron , or other material , make out written requisitions ; now , in the places having up-to-date employment departments , they do the same thing for their materials of brain and muscle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of men and women needed to do the particular work . If the person sent does not fill the bill , the foreman can refuse him ; the employment department sends another man , and then sends the rejected person somewhere else , where his services seem more clearly indicated . The employment department thus performs two functions : first , it studies the requirements of the shop ; secondly , it studies minutely the miscellaneous human beings who offer themselves at its doors . Its theory is that every person can do something . It submits all its applicants to physical and mental tests , canvasses their past successes and failures , learns their habits , their ambitions , their aptitudes . By the aid of a competent medical man , it examines their eyes , noses , throats , teeth , heart , lungs , and digestive systems . After the employee is once engaged , the department 's work has really only begun . It gets periodical reports ; if the man is not doing well , it finds out why ; and it makes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . One of the greatest of American estab-lishments , located in Ohio , begins sorting out its employees long before they have entered the plant . It works in association with the grammar and high schools , which have arranged particular courses intended to fit boys and girls for particular places in this great industry.In this way , long before the time arrives to go on the pay-roll , the employment department has learned just what these prospective employees can do , and , after graduation , can immediately place them where they belong . For important office positions it has a special arrangement . It selects so many boys , in the junior and senior years at the high school , who seem especially promising . These boys attend school , and , as part of their school work , also spend certain hours in the factory office . Here they are tried out , in one position after another , until their finest aptitudes manifest themselves . As soon as they are graduated , therefore , they at once step into a good position which there is every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an exalted instance of fitting people to their jobs . Many employers adopt this system of pre-education , though not to this same degree . But most are beginning to have greater respect for the sanctity of a job . A man once entered on the pay-roll has peculiar claims upon their forbearance . One of the greatest provocations to inefficiency is the overhanging worry of losing one 's job ; most human beings , once assured that every effort will be made to use them in some way , work to the best purpose . So the custom is rapidly spreading of shifting an unsuccessful employee around . If he fails at one job , he is put to work at another . No man is " fired " until he has had abundant chance to prove that he can do something . In one of the greatest plants in the Middle West , employing twenty thousand men and women , " firing " has practically ceased . No foreman or subofficer can perform this solemn ceremony . No man is ousted until one of the four highest executives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone over the case and pronounced it hopeless . Any employee threatened with such treatment can appeal in person to one of these executives . I could mention many great industrial organizations manufactories , depart-ment stores , mail-order houses , printing and publishing establishments , and the like ? that have adopted this new attitude toward the poor man 's only possession ? his job . And nearly all express their satisfaction with the experiment . They furnish plenty of illustrations which show its wisdom . Here , for example , is a foreman who shows signs of rheumatism . " He is useless , " the old school would have said ; " it 's too bad , but he must go ! " Now the company doctor makes an examination and finds that he is merely flat-footed . He is relieved by properly fitting shoes and does twice as much work as before . Under the old conditions , he would have " floated " about , through no fault of his own , and degenerated into a misfit . Here is a girl who starts work feeding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her to " get her time . " Why waste efforts on a demonstrated incompetent ? But the modern system tries her at light , clerical work . Again she fails . She is put to work figuring elapsed time on tickets . Once more she proves a disappointment . She is now called upon to inspect finished books ? it is a printing shop and this turns out to be the very thing that Heaven ordained her to do . She simply loves her new work , and becomes an asset to the concern . Another girl started feeding a gathering machine , but conspicuously lacked ability or interest in her work . Then she tried her hand on a sewingmachine , and caught the trick ; she is now an especially valued " hand . " A stenographer began work in an accounting department , but made unsatisfactory progress . She tried the same work in another department and failed again . After several experiences of this kind the employment department despaired of her . But there was some mystery in the matter ; she possessed all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Accidentally she was placed in a department where she had little supervision and had to assume a good deal of responsibility . The mystery was now solved . In the previous departments she had constantly worked under a superior , and the constant oversight unnerved her . She was one of the numerous people who " work best when left alone . " Under the new conditions she developed really brilliant qualities . The employment department put another girl to work inspecting ; when she failed at this , it tried her at filing . This did n't work , either . She then tried her hand at the telephone , and made a bad mess of it . Shethen obtained a job whose chief requirement was the accurate handling of figures . That was the one thing that she did beautifully . Here is a man who , after failing in several jobs , was placed on a cutting-machine , with deplorable results . The employment department looked him over again and decided to try him in the stock department . From the first moment in this new place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The employment department can give thousands of instances of the kind . All these people , under the old system , would have joined the perambulating classes ; a little effort at selection has transformed them into useful workers . But the man who has achieved the greatest success in this field is Henry Ford . He has demonstrated that the " floater " problem is not an inevitable one ; that thousands of men commonly scrapped as inefficient can play their part in the industrial organization . Most newspaper readers have hastily thought that Henry Ford 's plan was merely to give five dollars a day to his men as an act of simple largess or char-ity . In reality there is more to his system than this minimum wage . This is merely part of a comprehensive attempt to solve the problem of the inefficient man , and to find the appointed place of the misfit . " The sooner , " Mr. Ford says , If is j men can be taught that labor s ust as much an asset , and more , than machinery and buildings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introducing his profit - sharing plan , Mr. Ford 's plant represented all the evils of modern American industrialism . More than half the employees were recently arrived , non - English - speaking immigrants , and they came largely from that part of Europe which furnishes us our least desirable workingmen . They were southern Italians , Poles , Russians , Armenians , Servians , Greeks , Rumanians , and Syrians . Many of them lived in filthy homes ; heavy drinking and riotous living prevailed ; every morning the Detroit police-court contained its quota of Ford employees . The emplgyment statistics disclosed that the " five-day men " were a conspicuous problem . Mr. Ford employed about 6,000 people ; his records showed that more than 8,000 left every year ? more than onehalf of his whole force . These men represented , on the basis already given , a money loss of from $500,000 to $2,000 , - 0:3.0 a year . The company now has a staff of forty men , highly trained sociologists , whoseonly business is to keep closely in touch with the industrial operatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their homes , discuss their plans and ambitions . They have a school , now regularly attended by i , ioo , where the men are taught English . These welfare workers know their wives and their children ; if the men are discontented with their work and desire to do something else , these experts hear of it . If a man is getting along badly with his foreman , the case is looked into ; if , as is frequently the case , it is merely a matter of hopeless incompatibility , he is shifted to another foreman . These social overseers teach the men American citizenship ; they explain opportunity , and show the way to improvement in the social and industrial scale . The medical department examines all the men , with the result that their physical condition is greatly improved . If an employee is absent , his case is at once investigated ; if he falls ill , a physician is immediately sent to his home . Above all , his job is regarded as almost a vested interest . In six months only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are taken to fit each employee to his work . If he fails in one department , he is shifted to another . He may try his hand in a dozen before he finds the thing that he can do . Few men arc discharged , as practically all can render some service , and the candidate for dismissal has the right of appealing his case to the president himself . The casual reader is likely to dismiss all this as coddling . So , indeed , it seems ; but figures absolutely demonstrate that the system is a success . For , as already said , the records show that , in 1913 , the year before the system was adopted , half the employees , 8,000 out of i 6,000 , left the factory . Eight thousand men , that is , failed to make good . The next year only 447 left ! In toi3 the " floaters " numbered 5,156 ; in 1914 there were only 146 . Apparently , therefore , Mr. Ford has found the answer to the " greatest problem in American industry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because they have found a soft snap ; they have an easy time , they are constantly petted , their wages are higher than the market ? why should they leave ? But another fact disposes of this idea . That fact is the enormously increased efficiency of the works , as evidenced by the output . In February , 1913 , with i6,000 men , working ten hours a day , the Ford factory turned out 16,000 automobiles . In February , 1914 , with 15.800 men ? zoo fewer ? working eight hours a day ? two hours less ? it turned out 26,000 cars . A careful study of these figures proves that 5,000 floaters , who , under other circumstances , would have become wanderers on the face of the earth , became industrious , happy , successful human beings . These figures clearly demonstrate the wisdom of attempting to fit employees to their jobs . They show that the frightful economic waste of " hiring and firing " is the greatest prevailing industrial crime . They substantiate the optimistic conviction that the misfit is really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom industrialism has impatiently neglected . And this establishment succeeds because it cultivates man not only physically , but morally . Its employees are giving up the saloon and building homes . No employee qualifies for the famous minimum five dollars a day who does not show manhood and thrift . One day a six-footer , smelling of whisky , marched ferociously into the sociological department . ' Look here , " he shouted , " I want to know why I do n't get my five dollars a day ? " The chief looked into his record . " Where do you live ? " he asked , quietly . His home was a fifth-rate boardinghouse . " You spend most of your wages in the saloon , do n't you ? " " Well , I have a good time now and then . Why should n't I ? " " You do n't pay your bills regularly , do you ? Here are many complaints from tradesmen . " The man admitted that he did have some outstanding debts . " Have you a mother living ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see her last ? " " Ten years ago . " " Now look here , my friend , " answered the chief , " What kind of a citizen are you , anyway ? You do n't know , and do n't seem to care , whether your mother 's alive or dead . Do you suppose we are going to give you five dollars a day to spend on drink ? " The man , muttering to himself , left the office . In six weeks he came back . He was dressed more neatly ; the smell of the saloon had disappeared . He showed the chief a letter from his mother , showering the blessings of Heaven upon a dutiful son who had sent her $25 . It had just saved her from going to the poorhouse . " That 's fine , " said the chief . " Well , do I get my money now ? " " Oh no , not yet . " He came back in a month . His appearance showed that his reform was progressing . This time his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had paid a good-sized bill . " Splendid , splendid , " said the chief . " I suppose I get my money now ? " " No ; do n't be in too much of a hurry . " The next time the workman appeared he had a bank-book , showing a goodsized deposit . " Do I get five dollars a day now ? " " No . " " For Heaven 's sake , how long have I got to keep this up ? " " Until it does n't hurt you so much to do the right thing . " The man never came around again . But the office soon learned that he had bought a cottage , was paying for it on the instalment plan , and had recently furnished it , His mother , about the happiest old lady in the United States , had been installed there as his housekeeper . The man now gets his five dollars a day , his debts are all paid , and the saloon sees him no more . This is the modern way of handling @ @ @ @ @ @
