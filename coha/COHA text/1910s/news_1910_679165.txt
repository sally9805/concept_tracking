txt One of our correspondents made yesterday the interesting suggestion that the attempts to establish the English skylark in this country would have been more successful had the birds first been set free in the South instead of the North . The two little colonies of skylarks out on Long Island , it is said , have barely held their own , if that , and Mr. PROUT 'S theory of their failure to increase was based on their failure to migrate to gentler climatic conditions at the proper time . But if the Winters of the North have failed to drive these amiable and tuneful aliens south , it is hard to see why the Summers of the South would drive them north . The whole subject of bird migrations is full of mystery , however , and it would at least be worth while to try the skylark experiment as Mr. PROUT advises . It would be , that in , if we really want skylarks and will not he happy till we get them . There is no easily imaginable objeotion to their presence here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and inseots as well , that were desirable or harmless in the regions where they formed a part of the general balance of things , showed quite different characteristics when taken , by design or accident , to other lands where they had no natural enemies to keep them within bounds . And so ill have we treated our native birds that perhaps it would be judicious for us to mend our ways as regards them before we introduce other bird races to suffer like neglect or persecution . The natives include some of the most beautiful birds in the world , and perhaps its very best songsters. but neither aesthetic nor utilitarian appreciation of them has manifested itself until years comparatively recent , and even now It is confined to lamentably few people . As for the skylark , it is heresy to say so , but he owes Ma fame more to the associations , literary and other , that are connected with him , than to any amazing excellence as a musician . Sweeter songs than htscan still be heard at twilight in the recesses of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
