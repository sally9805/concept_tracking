Woo governs America ? The answer is obvious : we are a republic , a representative democracy enjoying the utmost government of , for , and by the people . America is governed by persons we choose by our own volition to serve us , to make , execute , andinterpret laws for us . Addicted as we are to the joy of phrases , we find in these unfailing delight . Democracy , ideally considered , is an affair of the wisest and best . . Ns I lie . privileges of the ballot are generously extended to all , the whole people are invested with an initiative and authority which it is t heir duty to exercise , Presumably all are proud of their inheritance of liberty , jealous of t heir power , and alert in performing all the duties of citizenship . That we are not , in fact , highly successful in realizing this ideal is it matter t hat is givirig increasing concern to t bought ful . Americans .

Opposed to the conscientious voter , tind capable of defeating his purpose , are agencies and influences with which it is well-nigh impossible for Into to cope . The higher his intelligence and the nobler his aim , the less lie is able to reckon with forces which are stubbornly determined to nullify his vote .

The revolt against Blaine in 1881 , the Gold-Democratic movement in 1890 , were most significant ; and I am disposed to give a sons ew hat similar value to the Progressive movement of 1912 . But the average voter is a creature of prejudice , who boasts jauntily that he never scratches his ticket . IIe follows his party with dogged submission and is more or less honestly blind to its faults . As my views on this subject are more usually voiced by independents than by partisans , it may not be amiss to say that I am a party man , a Democrat ; that I voted for Parker in 1904 , for Bryan in 1908 , and am regular ' enough in local contests to retain my right to vote with a good conscience in primary elections . Living in a state where there is no point of rest in politics , where one campaign dovetails into another , I have for twenty-five years lust , an observer of political tendencies and methods . I may say of the two great . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 1 have friends in both places . ' One of my best friends was a boss ' who served a term in prison for scratching a tally-sheet . I am perfectly familiar with the theories upon which bossism is justified , the more plausible being that only by maintaining strong local organizations , that is to say , 1 ' a-chines , can a party so entrench itself as to support effectively the policies and reforms dear to the heart of the idealist . And bosses do , indeed , sometimes use their power benevolently , though this happens usually where they see a chance to win advantage or to allay popular clamor . It is not of the pending campaign that I write , and any references I make to it are only for the purpose of illustrating phases or tendencies that seem worthy of consideration at a time when public thought is concentrated upon politics . And to give definite aim to this inquiry I shall state it in the harshest terms possible : We , a self-governing people , permit our affairs to be administered , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we ponder this . The types have a queer look . Such an accusation is an unpardonable sin against American institutions , ? against an intelligent , high-minded citizenry . It can , however , do no harm to view the matter from various angles to determine whether anything really may be adduced in support of it . // In theory the weight of the majority is with the fit . This is the pleasantest of ideas , but it is not true . It is not true at least in so great a number of contests as to justify any virtuous complacency in the electorate . It is probably no more untrue now than in other years , though the cumulative effect of a long experience of government by the unfit is having its effect upon the nation in discouraging faith in that important and controlling function of government that has to do with the choice and election of candidates . Only rarely ? and I speak carefully ? do the best men possible for a given office ever reach it . The best men are never even considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices ; they do not offer themselves , either because office-holding is distasteful , or because private business is more lucrative , or because they are aware of no demand for their services on the part of their fellow citizens . By fitness I mean the competence produced by experience and training , fortified with moral character and a sense of responsibility . I should say that a fit man for public office is one who in his private affairs has established some reputation for efficiency and trustworthiness . In assuming that : a democracy like ours presupposes in the electorate a desire , no matter how feeble , to intrust public affairs to men of fitness , to first-rate men , it would seem that with the approach of every presidential campaign numbers of possible candidates would receive consideration as eligible to our highest office . It will be said that just as many candidates were available in 1916 as at any other period in our history , but this is neither conclusive nor heartening : there should be morel It can not be pretended that public service does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can , however , be complained that the offices fall very largely to the inferior . We have just witnessed the spectacle of a great republic , which confides the broadest powers to its chief executive , strangely limited in its choice of candidates for the presidency to a handful of men . No new commanding figure had sprung forward from the ranks of either party in the most trying period the country has known in fifty years . If Mr. Wilson 's renomination had not been inevitable , it would be very difficult to name another Democrat who , by virtue of demonstrated strength and public confidence , would have been able to enter the lists against him . Our only Democratic presidents since the Civil War stepped from a governor 's seat to the higher office ; but . I know of no Democratic governor who , in 1916 , could have entered the national convention supported by any appreciable public demand for his nomination . And no Democratic Senator could have debated Mr. Wilson 's claims to further recognition . Speaker Clark , with the prestige of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Convention , might have been able to reappear at St. Louis with a similar showing ; but the Democratic range of possibilities certainly had not widened . To be sure , Mr. Bryan would have remainecl to reckon wit h ; but , deeply as the party and the country is indebted to him for his courageous stand against the bosses at Baltimore , he could hardly have received a fourth nomination . The Republicans were in no better case when their convention met at Chicago . The Old Guard was stubbornly resolved , not only that A short distance from the scene of their deliberations , the Progressives , having failed to estab- lisp themselvesiii a permanent contestant of t he older part ids , tenaciously clung to their leader . Mr. Roosevelt 's effort to interest the Republicans in Senator Lodge as a compromise candidate fell upon deal ears . Mr. Hughes 's nomination was a part of the cut-and-dried programme which the high powers carried to Chicago . Mr. Hughes 's high qualifications may not . be seriously questioned . Be is a first-ra te man , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was received by the perfectly ordered and controlled body of delegates is not 10 his discredit . Sore beset , t he Old Guard put forth a Candidat e little to t heir taste , one who , if elected , would , we must itssutne , prove quote impatient . of Lhe cramped harness fashioned for presidents by the skilled armorers of t he good old days of backward-looking Itepuhlieanism . In taking from the blench a gentleman Who was out or politics ' the Republicans emphasized t heir lamentable lack of available candidates . Nothing was ever sadder than the roll-call Of states for the nomination of favorite sons . ' Estimable though these men are , no one could have listened to the ' nominating speeches and witnessed the subsequent mechanical demonstrations without depression . None of these nominees had the slightest chance ; the orators who piped their little lays in praise or t hem knew they had not ; the vast audience that witnessed the proceedings , perfectly aware of the farcical Rat ure of t these banalities , knew they had not. , and viewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reception accorded Messrs . Depew and Cannon , . who were called upon to entertain the audience during a lull in the proceedings , was not without t its pathos . They dwelt upon the party 's past glories with becoming poignancy . Mr. Borah , tactfully projected as a representative of a newer order of Republicanism , was far less effective . The convention was grcItly stirred by no new voice ; no new leader flashed u pot , the stage to quicken it to new and high endeavor . No less inspired or inspiring body of men ever gathered than those who constituted the Republican Convention of 1916 . I asked a successful lawyer the other day how he accounted for the lack- of presidential timber . ' It ' s because the average American would rather be president . of ( he Pennsylvania Railroad than of the United States , ' he answered .

We shall pay one of these days a high price for our indifference . is danger ahead unless we are disposed to take our politics more seriously , and unless more young men of the best talent and the highest aims can be lured into puldie life . The present . showing is certainly not encouraging as to the future of American statesmanship ; and to say that the fit have ud ways been few , is not a particularly consoling answer . It is true of a period still susceptible of intimate scrutiny ? say , from the Civil War  --  that president ial candidates have been chosen in every ease from a small group of potentialities in both parties . We have established ( stupidly in any large view of the matter ) geographical limitations upon the possible choice that greatly narrow the field . Candidates for the presidency must be chosen , with an eye to the local effect , from states essential to success . Though Mr. Blaine 's candidacy was surrounded by unusual circumstances , it emphasizes , nevertheless , the importance to the parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had no New England presi- // dent since Franklin Pierce . This is not because the New England states have not produced men of fitness , but is attributable solely to the small representation of the Northeastern states in the Electoral College . The South , likewise , has long been eliminated from the reckoning . Though of Virginia birth , Mr. Wilson is distinctly not ' a Southern man ' in the familiar connotations of that term . In old times the Southern states contributed men of the first rank to both houses of Congress ; but , apart from Mr. Underwood ( who received 1171 votes it Baltimore ) and Mr. John Sharp Williams , there are no Southerners of conspicuous attainments in the present Senate . The Southern bar embraces now , perhaps as truly its at any earlier period , lawyers of distinguished ability , but they apparently do not find Al Hie life attractive . No president , has yet been elected from beyond the Mississippi , though NI r . Bryan , thrice a candidate , widened the area of choice westward . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only trans- ississippi men mentioned its possibilities , and they cut no figure in the contest . We are still a congeries of states , or groups of states , rather than a nation , with a resulting political provincialism that is disheartening when we consider t he economic and political power we wield increasingly in world-affairs . It is a serious commentary upon I he talent of recent congresses that the llouse has developed no men so commanding as to awaken speculation as to their availability for the presidency . No member of the House figured this year in Republican presidential speculations . Why do the second-rate predominate in a body that may be called the most typical of our institutions ? Lincoln , Hayes , Garfield , Blaine , McKinley , Bryan , all candidates for the presidency , had been members of the House , but it has become negligible as a training school for presidents . A year ago Air . Mann received an occasional honorable mention , but his petulant fling at 1 he President as ' playing politics , ' in the grave hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , effectually silenced his admirers . Admirable as partisanship may be , there arc times when even an opposition floor-leader should be able to rise above it ! Nor is it possible for Democrats to point to Air . . Kitchin with any degree of pride . Of both these men it may be said that never have leaders failed so lamentably to rise to their opportunities . ' Mr. Hay , of Virginia , Chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs , not only yielded reluctantly to lie public pressure for preparedness , but established his unfitness to hold any office by tacking on the Army bill a ' joker ' designed to create a place for a personal friend . Mr. Wilson , like Mr. Cleveland , has found his congresses unruly-or wobbly , or egregiously. stupid , manifesting astonishingly little regard for their party principles or policies . ' the present majority has been distinguished for nothing so much as impotttnce and parochialism . Without respect to part y , the average Representative 's vision is no wider than his district , and he ponders national affairs solely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used him as an errand-boy , a pension agent , a beggar at the national till . his time is spent in demonstrating to his constituency that when ' pork ' is being served he is on hand with Oliver Twists plate .

T he member who carries a map of his district with him to Washington , and never broadens his horizon , is a relic of simpler times . In days like these we can ill-afford to smile with our old tolerance at , the plain man of the people ' who is likely to be just a demagogue . A frock coat and a kind heart are not in themselves qualifications for a congressman . Eccent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scorn of conventions , have all been sadly overworked . Talent of the finst order is needed in Congress ; it is no place for men who ca n't see and think straight . The Senate preserves at least something of its old competence , and the country respects , I think , the hard work recently performed by it . While its average is low , it contains men ? some of them little in the public eye ? NV he are specialists in certain fields . There is , I believe , a general feeling t hat , with our tremendous industrial and commercial interests , the presence in the upper house of a considerable number of business men and of rather fewer lawyers would make for a bet ter balanced and more representative body . A first-rate senator need not be an orator . The other clay , when Senator Taggart , a new member , protested vigorously against the latest River-andIiarbor swindle t he country applauded . Refreshing , indeed , to hear a new voice in t hose sacred precincts raised against waste and plunder ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is probably as well informed on he tariff as any man in America . I give him the benefit of this advertisement , the more cheerfully as I do not agree with h his views ; but his information is entitled to all respect . The late David Turpie , of Indiana , by nature a recluse , and one of the most unassuming men who ever sat in the Senate , was little known to the country at large . I once heard r . Roosevelt and Judge Gray of Delaware engage in a most interesting exchange of anecdotes illustrative of Mr. Turpie 's wide range of information . Ile was a first-rate man . There is room in the Senate for a great variety of talent , and its efficiency is not injured by the frequent injection of new blood . What the country is impatient of in the upper house is dead men who have little information and no opinions of value on any subject ? the second-rate man .

I should be sorry to apply any words of President Wilson in a quarter where he did not intend them , but a paragraph of his address to the Washingt on correspondents ( May 15 ) might well . be taken to heart by a number of gentlemen occupying seats in the legislative branch of t he government . ' I have a profound intellectual contempt for Mon who can not see the signs of the times . I have to deal with some men who know no more of the modern processes of politics than if they were living in the eighteenth century , and for them I have a profound and comprehensive intellectual contempt .

I am talking in vactio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a first-rate man engaged in the trying occupation of attempting to communicate a first-rate idea to a second-rate mind . Thus reported in the press . ? THE EDITORS . THE SECOND-RATE MAN IN POLITICS 1St ttt In recent years our periodiCal litera1 are has devoted much space to discussions of problems of efficiency . We have heard repeatedly of the demand , not for two-thousand-dollar men , but for ten- , twenty- , and fifty-thousanddollar men , in the great industries . The efficiency engineer has sprung into being ; in my own city several hundred employees of an automobile company are organized into a class of which a professor of psychology is the leader , the purpose being the promotion of individual and corporate efficiency . The first-rate man is in demand , as a buyer , a salesman , a foreman , a manager . One of the largest corporations in America pays its employees bonuses apportioned on a basis of their value as displayed from month to month . The minutest economies are a matter of daily study in every manufacturing and commercial house ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a special genius for buying and selling , need never go unrecognized . Recently a New York bank spent months searching for a bond-seller , and finally chose an obscure young man from a Western town who fell by chance under the eye of a ' scout ' sent out to look for talent . But this eager search for the first-rate man , so marked in commerce and industry , only rarely touches our politics . It is only in politics that the second-rate man finds the broadest field for the exercise of his talents . A president is beset by many embarrassments in the exercise of the appointing power . Our feudal system , by which senators and representatives are the custodians of post-offices , district attorneyships , marshalships , and countless other positions , does not make for the recognition of the fit . While the power to appoint is vested in the executive , his choice must he approved by the senators or representatives . As the system operates , it is not really the president W ho appoints but the senators , or , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to meet their wishes . To question their recommendations is to arouse animosity , and where the fate of important legislation hangs in the balance a president is under strong temptation to accept the recommendation of second-rate men in order to keep the members of the law-making bodies in good humor . In the professions and industries , in commercial houses , even on the farm , the second-rate man is not wanted ; but political jobs , high and low , are everywhere open to him . Everything but the public service is standardized ; politics alone puts a premium upon inferiority . The greatest emphasis is laid upon the word service in every field but government . The average American wants what he wants when he aunts it , ' and is proud of his ability to get it . If it is n't right , we make it right , ' is a popular business slogan . Hotels whose indifferent service wins the displeasure of the traveling public are execrated and blacklisted . On the other hand , 1 have listened for hours to the laudation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobile manufacturers who ' give good service . ' We have a pride in these things ; we like to relate incidents of our successful kick ' when the berth that we hacl reserved by telegraph was n't forthcoming and how we took it up ' with the railroad authorities , and how quickly our wounded feelings were poulticed . ' I guess that wo n't happen again on that road ! ' we chortle . Conversely we make our errands to a city hall or courthouse as few as possible , knowing that the ' service , ' conducted at the people 's expense , is of a different order , and public 1 82 THE SECOND-RATE MAN IN POLITICS officials may not be approached in that confident spirit with which we carry our needs or complaints to the heads of a private business . Or , if some favor is to be asked , we brag that we have seen ' Jim ' or ' llob ' and that he ' fixed it for us . It happens not infrequently that we want something ' fixed ' from purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed , ' ? and it gives us a pleasurable sense of our ' influence ' to know that , as we have always treated ' , Jim ' or ' Bob ' all right , ' .1 ' or ' Bob ' cheerfully assists us . We chuckle over ease with which he accomplished the fixing where it would have been impossible for us to effect it through a direct legitimate appeal . Thus in hundreds of ways a boss , great or small , is able to grant favors that cost him nothing , thereby blurring the vision of those he places under obligations to the means by which he gains his power . In municipal government , the second-and the third-rate man , on down to a point where differentiations fade to the vanishing point , finds his greatest hope and security . As first-rate men are not ' available ' for the offices , they fall naturally to the inferior , the incompetent , or the corrupt . In few cities of a hundred thousand population is a man of trained ability find recognized fitness ever seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the broad powers conferred upon mayors , requires fitness of the highest order . Usually without experience of large affairs , and crippled at the start by a well-established tradition that he must reward party workers and personal friends , the incumbent surrounds himself with second- and third-rate men , for whose incompetency the taxpayer meekly pays the bills . The mayor 's office is hardly second to the presidency in the variety of its perplexities . A man of the highest aims will fail to satisfy a whole community . There is in every city a group of reformers who believe that a mayor should be able to effect the moral regeneration of the human race in one term of office . The first-rate man is aware of this , and the knowledge diminishes his anxiety to seek the place . A common indictment against the capable man who volunteers for municipal service is that his ignorance of political methods would make him impractical ' if he were elected . This sentiment . is expressed frequently ? often by large taxpayers . The insinuation is t hat a man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers that prey by indirection . This is quite true : the fit man , the first-rate man , who would undertake the office untrammeled by political obligationS , would not know the ' good fellows ' who must be dealt with in a spirit of leniency . This delicate duty is more safely intrusted to one who brings a certain sympathy to bear upon the task . Whatever may be the merits of party government . in its national application , there is no sound argument for its continuance in municipal affairs . Its effect is to discourage , utterly , in most communities , any effort the first-rate man may be absurd enough to make to win enough of the franchises of his fellow citizens to land him in the mayoralty . On one occasion a Republican United States Senator , speaking for his party 's candidate for the mayoralty at the last rally of a campaign in my own city , declared that his party must win , as defeat would have a discouraging effect on Republicans elsewhere . A few years ago both parties chose , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Republican candidate was an auctioneer , whose ready tongue and drolleries on the stump made him TEE SECOND-RATE the central figure in a highly picturesque campaign . He was successful and the affairs of a city of a quarter of a million people were cheerfully turned over to him . Ignorant of the very terminology in which municipal affairs arc discussed , he avoided embarrassment by remaining away from his office as much as possible . In the last year of his administration  --  if so dignified a term may be applied to his incumbency ? he resigned , to avoid the responsibility of dealing With disorders consequent upon a serious strike , and took refuge on the vaudeville stage , from which , I understand , he threatens to run again ! He was no more unfit on the day he resigned than on the day of his nomination or elect ion ? a fact of which the electorate had ample knowledge . ITe was chosen merely because he was a vote-getter . Republicans voted for him to preserve their regularity . I am prolonging these comments On municipal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political factor is of so great influence in t he state and nation , and because the domination of the unfit , in the smaller unit offers more tangible instances for study . The impediments encountered by the fit who offer themselves for public service are many , and often ludicrous . Twice , in Indianapolis , men of the highest standing have yielded under pressure to a demand that they offer themselves for t he Republican mayoralty nominal ion . Neither had the slightest intention of using the mayoralty as a stepping-stone to higher office ; the motives animating both were the highest . One of them was quickly disposed of by the report . sent ' down the line ' that he had not been as regular as he might be , and by this token was an undesirable candidate . The other was subjected to a crushing defeat in the primary . There was nothing against him except that MAN IN POT , ITICS 18:1 he was unknown to the ' boys in the trenches . ' From the window by which I write I can see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these gentlemen . lie has constantly shown his public spirit in the most generous fashion ; he is an admirable citizen . I dare say there is not an incompetent man or woman on his pay-roll . If he Were out of employment and penniless to-morrow , scores of responsible positions would be open to him . But the public would not employ him ; his own party would not even permit its membership to express its opinion of him ; and hail he gone before the electorate he would in till liltelihood have Well defeated by an invincibly combination of every element of incompetence and venality in the city .

Such men tire ineligible for municipal office ; t hey are first-rate men ; the very fact that tluty are men of character and ability who could be trusted to manage public affairs as they conduct their private business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as these ( ire not calculated to encourage the capable man , the first-rate man , to attempt to gain a public posit bin . In fact , it is the business of political organizations to make the defeat of such men as humiliating as possibly . They mist be got rid of ; t hey must be taught belt er man-ners ! The good-nature wit h which we accept the second-rate man in municipal office is one of t he most bewildering of all our political phenomena . ' Well , things have always been this way , and I guess tiny tdways Will be , ' expresses the average citizen 's feeling about the matter . As he can not , without much 184 THE SECOND-RATE MAN IN POLITICS personal discomfort , change the existing order , he finds solace in the reflection that he could n't do anything about it if he tried . The more intolerant he is of second-rate employees in his own business , the more supinely he views the transfer of public business from one set of incompetents to another . To lift municipal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never shut up shop but are ceaselessly plotting and planning to perfect their lines , is manifestly no easy task , but it may be accomplished by effective leadership where the people are sincerely interested . And it is significant that the present movement for an abandonment of the old pernicious , costly system took rise from the dire calamities that befell two cities ? Galveston and Dayton ? which were suddenly confronted with problems that it would have been madness to intrust to incompetents . This illustrates a point overlooked by that large body of Americans who refuse to bring to their politics the test of fitness that they enforce in private business . The second-rate man may successfully hide his errors in normal conditions , but his faults and weaknesses become glaringly apparent when any severe demands are made upon him . I can suggest no permanent solution of the problem of municipal government that does not embrace the training of men for its particular duties . A development of the city-manager plan , of nation-wide scope , fortified by special courses of training , may ultimately solve it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a familiar phase of our politics and is most potent in the game of checking the advance of the fit and assuring domination by the unfit . Sev eral thousand young men leave college every year with some hope of entering upon a political career . By the time a young man is graduated he has elected to follow the banner of some party . If he lives in a city and shows a disposition to be of practical service , he is warmly welcomed into the fold of one of the organizations . He quickly becomes ILWE , .. ' e that only by the display of a servile obedience and following of the leaders can he expect to become persona grata to the party powers . By the time he has passed through one campaign as a trusted member of a Machine , his political illusions are well-nigh destroyed . His childish beliefs that only the fit should be elevated to positions of responsibility , that public office is a public trust , are pretty well dissipated . ' Good ' men , he finds , are good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosses . To strike at a boss is lose majeste , and invites drastic punishment . The purpose of the young men 's political clubs everywhere is to infuse the young voter with the spirit of blind obedience and subjection . He is graciously permitted to serve on club committees as a step toward more important recognition as ward committeeman , or is given a place of some sort at headquarters during the campaign . There are dozens of ways in which the willing young man may be of use . His illusions rapidly vanish . He is flattered by the attentions of the bosses , who pat him on the back and assure him that they appreciate his loyal devotion to the party . With the hope of preferment before him it is essential that he establish as quickly as possible a reputation for regularity . ' If his wise elders note any restiveness , any tendency toward independence , they at once warn him that he must ' play the game straight ' and shut his eyes to the sins of his party . Or if his counselors sym- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way he can gain a position from which to make his ideas effective is by strongly establishing his regularity and building up a personal following . In a campaign preliminary to a local primary in my city I appealed to a number of young men of good antecedents and rather exceptional education , to oppose a particular candidate . One of them , on coming home from an eastern university , had introduced himself to me in the name of a great educator who was one of my particular admirations . In every one of these cases I was politely rebuffed . They said the gentleman whose ambitions annoyed me was a ' good fellow ' and all right ' ; they could n't see that any good would come of antagonizing him . And they were right . No good did come of it so far as the result was concerned . There are countless ways in which a young lawyer finds his connection with a machine helpful . A word in the right quarter brings him a client ? saloonkeeper , perhaps , who is meeting with resistance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or petty criminal cases before magistrates ? easily arranged where the machine controls the police . He can not fail to be impressed with the perfection of a system that so smoothly wields power by indirection . The mystery of it all , the potency of the names of the high powers , appeal to his imagination ; there is a something of romance in it . A deputy-ship in the office of the prosecuting attorney leads on to a seat in the legislature , and he may go to Congress if he is ' good . ' He is purchased with a price , bought , and paid for ; his status is fixed ; he is a second-rate man . And by every such young man in America the ideal of Democracy , the hope of Republican government , is just so much weakened . Government by the unfit , domination by the inferior , is greatly assisted by a widely accepted superstition ? the belief that a second-rate man , finding himself in a position of responsibility , is likely to display undreamed-of powers . The idea seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laying on of hands , confers fitness where none has previously existed . Unfortunately such miracles arc not frequent enough to form the basis of a political philosophy . Recourse to the recall as a means of getting rid of an undesirable office-holder strikes me as only likely to increase the indifference , the languor , with which we now perform our political duties . Contempt for the educated man , a preposterous assumption that by the very fact of his training he is unfitted for office , continues to be prevalent in many minds . Conscious of this disqualification , President Wilson finds amusement at times in referring to himself as a schoolmaster ; much criticism of his administration is based upon the melancholy fact that he is a professor , ' a scholar , as though a lifelong student of history and politics were disqualified , by the very fact of his preparation , for exalted office . The direct primary , as a means of assisting first-rate men to office , has not yet realized what was hoped for it , and there is growing skepticism as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failings that we expect laws and systems to work automatically . If the first-rate man cherishes the delusion that he need only offer himself to his fellow partisans and they will delightedly spring to his support , he is doomed to a sad awakening . Unless he has taken the precaution to ask the organization 's ' permission to put his name on the ballot and is promised 1 86 THE SECOND-RATE MAN IN POLITICS suppOrt , he must perfect . an organization of his OWn with which to make his fight in the primary . He must open headquarters ' from which to carry on his operations , make speeches before as many citizens as can he assembled to hear him , enlist and pay helpers , most of whom expect , jobs in case he is successful .

I venture the assertion that many hundreds of candidates for office in this year of grace began their campaigns for elect ion already encumbered by debts incurred in winning their nominations , which brought them only hall-way to the goal . Such a burden , with all its connotations of curtailed liberty and shackling obligations , may not be viewed with equanimity . Instead of making office-bolding more attractive to the first-rate man , the direct primary ' multiplies its discouragements . The second-rate man , being willing to accept ollice as a party , not a public , trust , and to use it in every way possible for the strengthening of party lines , has the first-rate man , who has only his merits to justify his ambit ions , at a serious disadvantage . Where an organization ( the term by which a machine prefers to be called ) finds that it is likely to meet with rebuke through public resentment of its excesses , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in cases of sheer desperation . There is nothing more amusing than the virtuous airwith which a machine will nominate a first-rate man where there is no possible danger of party success . Ile it is whom the bosses are willing to sacrifice . The trick is turned ingeniously to the bosses ' advantage , for defeat in such instances proves to the truly loyal that only the ' regulars ' can get anywhere . A young , friend of mine once persuaded me io join him in bucking ' a primary for the election of delegates t a state convention . I cheerfully lent my assistance in this laudable enterprise , the more readily when he confided to Me his intention of employing machine methods . A young man of intelligence and humor , he had , by means which I deplored but to which I contributed , lured from the organization one of its star performers . I speak of this without shame , that the cynical may not complain that I am of those star-gazers who look upon politics as being what an Ohio statesman once called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew the game ; Ile knew how to collect and deliver voters by most approved machine methods . We watched him work with the keenest satisfaction . He brought citizens in great , numbers to vote our slate ' ; many of them men W110 had never been in the ward before . We gloated with satisfaction as t lie clay declined and our voles continued to pile up . Our moral natures were in the balance ; if we beat the machine with machine methods we meant never , never to be good again ! It seemed indeed that our investment in the skilled Worker could not , fail of success . When the votes were counted , oh , what a fall was there , my countrymen ! ' Our man ' had merely used our automobiles , and I refrain from saying what other munitions of war , to get out the vote of the opposition ! We had in other words , accomplished our own defeat ! // VI The past year has been marked by t he agitation for military preparedness ; civil preparedness strikes me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? or only half right ? in my assert ion that . we are governed very largely by second-rate men and that public business is confided chiefly to the unfit , t hen here is a matter that can not be ignored by t hose who look forward hopefully to the future of American democracy . There are more dangers within than without , and our tame acceptance of incompetence in civil office would certainly bring calamity if suffered in a military establishment . The reluctance of first-rate men to accept or seek office is more disquiet ing than t he slow enlistments in the army and navy . Competence in the one would do much to assure intelligent foresight and efficiency in the ot her . It is a disturbing thought that we , t he people , really care so little and that we are so willing to suffer government . by t he second-rate , only murmuring despairingly when the unhappy results of our apathy bring us sharply face to face with failure . " Thu fatalism of the multitude , ' commented upon strikingly by Lord Bryce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a kindly providence presides over our destinies and that everything will come out right in the end . ' But . Government by Good Luck is not a safe reliance for a nation of a hundred millions . Nothing in history supports a blind faith in numbers or in the wisdom of majorities . America 's hope liesin the multiplication of the fit , ? the saving remnant of Isaiah 's prophesies and Plato 's philosophy , ? a doctrine applied to America by Mat thew Arnold , who remains one of the shrewdest and most penetrating of all our critics . Mr. Arnold distrusted numbers and had no confidence in majorities . He said , ? ' To he a voice outside the State , speaking to mankind or to the future , perhaps shaking t he actual State to pieces in doing so , one man will suffice . But to reform the State in order to save it , to preserve it by changing it , a body of workers is needed as well as a. leader ; a considerable body of workers , placed at many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , amid ' the thunder of the captains , and the shouting , ' there must be many thousands of Americans who are truly of the saving remnant , who view public matters soberly and hold as something very fine and precious our herit age of democracy . These we may suppose will wit ness the dawn of election day with a lively apprehension of their august responsibilities , and exercise their right of selection sanely and iv is e y ' They only who build upon ideas , build for eternity , ' wrote Emerson . This nation was founded on ideas ; and clearly in the ideas of the fit , the earnest , the serious , lies its hope for the future . To eliminate the second-rate , to encourage the first-rate man to undertake offices of responsibility and power ? such must be the immediate concern and I he urgent business of all who love America .
