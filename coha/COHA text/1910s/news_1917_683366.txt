In no other way can the burden be discharged fairly and as a matter of right rather than charity . No voluntary organization or organizations could adequately cope with a duty of such magnitude . " The American people will not , of course , permit families to suffer want because their breadwinners are fighting for their country . Cases will undoubtedly arise wherein the allowance of the Government will not be adequate to protect a family from financial distress . Such instances the Red Cross will hope to provide for through its chapters . " The Red Cross chapters can and will provide also the friendly services which may , be needed and acceptable because of ill health or other misfortune or because of family conditions which if nee-Meted would result in need and suffering or disaster to the home .
