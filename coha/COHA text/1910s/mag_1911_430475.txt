 | Miss Alcott 's New England I REMEMBER being very much impressed ? and not a little shocked ? when a friend of mine told me that she had never , in her childhood , been able to get any real pleasure out of Louisa Alcott 's stories . It had never occurred to me that being brought up in New York instead of in New England , or even being of Southern instead of Pilgrim stock , could make all that difference . Miss Alcott seemed the safe inheritance , the absolutely inevitable delight , of childhood . Little Women was as universal as Hamlet . I remembered perfectly that French playmates of mine in Paris had loved Les Quatre Filles du Docteur March ( though the French version was probably somewhat expurgated ) . If children of a Latin ? moreover , of a Royalist and Catholic ? tradition could find no flaw in Miss Alcott 's presentment of young life , I could not see why any free-born American child should fail to find it sympathetic . I questioned my friend more closely . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that I owe my later appreciation of Miss Alcott 's special quality and special documentary value . For what my friend said was simply that the people in the books were too underbred for her to get any pleasure out of reading about them . My friend was not , when I knew her , a snob ; and I took it that she had made the criticism originally at a much earlier age . All children are as snobbish as they know how to be ; and I fancy that the child 's perennial delight in fairy-tales is not 180 ? @# due solely to the epic instinct . One is interested in princes and princesses . when one is eight , simply because they are princes and princesses . Of royalty . one is perfectly sure . I have never known a child who did not prefer the goose-girl to be a princess in disguise . or who felt any real sympathy with the princess who was only a disguised goose-girl . You do not have to expound the Divine Right to any one under twelve . Peasants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of age . Out of such axioms as these , I made my explanation of my friend 's heterodoxy . I remembered my own reaction . when very young , on a story that centred in a masked ball to which all the inhabitants of the kingdom were bidden . All the milkmaids went as court ladies , and all the court ladies went as milkmaids ? a mere rounding out of the Petit Trianon episode . The moral was obvious ; and I recall being frightfully disturbed by my own absolute certainty that , if I had been going to a masked ball , I should , without hesitation , have gone as grandly as I possibly could . I should never have gone as a milkmaid , so long as the costumer had a court train left . Did it perhaps mean that I was , on the whole , nearer to the milkmaid than to the court lady ? I did not like the story , but I have never , to this day , forgotten it . Perhaps my friend had been of the same age when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my contemporaries had made no such discrimination . As I say , it set me to thinking . Since then , @#  | I have read Miss Alcott over , not once , but many times , and I think I understand . The astounding result of rereading Miss Alcott at a mature age is a conviction that she probably gives a better impression of mid-century New England than any of the more laborious reconstructions , either in fiction or in essay . The youth of her characters does not hinder her in this ; for childhood , supremely , takes life readymade . Mr. Howells 's range is wider , and he is at once more serious and more detached . Technically , he and Miss Alcott can be compared as little as Madame Bovary and the Bibliotheque Rose . Yet , although their testimonies often agree , his world does not ' compose ' as hers does . It may be his very realism ? his wealth of differentiating detail , his fidelity to the passing moment ? that makes his early descriptions of New England so out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be typical . All her people have the ? same background , live in the same atmosphere , profess the same ideals . Moreover , they were ideals and an atmosphere that imposed themselves widely during their period . Mr. Howells gives us modern instances in plenty , but nowhere does he give us clearly the quintessential New England village . It is precisely the familiar experiences of life in that quintessential village that Miss Alcott gives us , with careless accuracy , without arriere-pensee . And it must be remembered that , in spite of Dr. Holmes 's brave and appropriating definitions of aristocracy , and the urbanity which the descendants of our great New Englanders would fain persuade us their ancestors possessed , our great New Englanders were essentially villagers , and that the very best thing to be said of them is that they wrought out village life to an almost Platonic perfection of type . NEW ENGLAND 181 Town ' will not do to express the Boston , the Cambridge , the Salem , the Concord , of an earlier time : it smacks too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , spiritually speaking , the villages that they founded are villages still . The village that Miss Alcott knew best was Concord ; and if , for our present purpose , we find it convenient to call Concord typical of New England , we shall certainly not be doing New England any injustice . As I say , what strikes one on first rereading her , is the extraordinary success with which she has given us our typical New England . Some of her books , obviously , are less successful in this way than others ? Under the Lilacs , for example , or Jack and Jill , where ( one can not but agree with her severer critics ) there is an inexcusable amount of love-making . There is an equally inexcusable amount of lovemaking , it is interesting to remember , in much of the earlier Howells . But for contemporary record of manners and morals , you will go far before you match her masterpiece , Little Women . What Meg , Jo , Beth , Amy , and Laurie do not teach us about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall never learn from any collected edition of the letters of Emerson , Thoreau , or Hawthorne . The next ? and equally astounding ? result of rereading Miss Alcott was , for me , the unexpected and not wholly pleasant corroboration of what my friend had said about her characters . They were , in some ways , underbred . Bronson Alcott ( or shall we say Mr. March ? ) quotes Plato in his family circle ; but his family uses inveterately bad grammar . Do n't talk about " labelling " Pa , as if he was a pickle-bottle ! ' ? thus Jo chides her little sister for a Malapropism . Bad grammar we might expect from Jo , as a willful freak ;  | but should we expect the exquisite Amy ( any little girl will tell you how exquisite Amy is supposed to be ) to write to her father from Europe , about buying gloves in Paris , Do n't that sound sort of elegant and rich ? ' The bad grammar , in all the books , is constant . And yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere , wherein the background is so unbrokenly and sincerely literary . ' Cheap literature is unsparingly satirized ; Plato and Goethe are quoted quite as everyday matters ; and a metaphysical streak had unconsciously got into ' Jo 's first novel . In The Rose in Bloom , Miss Alcott misquotes Swinburne , to be sure , but she does it in the interest of morality ; and elsewhere Mac quotes other lines from the same poet correctly . Of course , we all remember that Emerson 's Essays helped on , largely , Mac 's wooing ? if , indeed , they did not do the whole trick . And has there ever been an abode of learning ' ? to slip , for a moment , into the very style of Jo 's Boys ? like unto Plumfield , crowned by Parnassus ' ? After all , too , we must remember how familiarly even those madcaps , Ted and Josie , bandied about the names of Greek gods . The boys and girls who scoff at the simple amusements of Miss Alcott 's young heroes and heroines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classical mythology as the young people they despise . Yet , as I say , the bad grammar is everywhere ? even in the mouths of the educators . Breeding is , of course , not merely a matter of speech ; and I fancy that my friend referred even more specifically to their manners ? their morals being unimpeachable . Miss Alcott 's people are , as the author herself says of them , unworldly . They are even magnificently so ; and they score the worldly at every turn . You remember Mrs. March 's strictures on the Moffats , and Polly 's justifiable criticisms of Fanny Shaw 's friends ? and Rose 's utter lack of snobbishness about Phoebe , the little scullery-maid , who eventually was brought up with her ? Of course , Archie 's mother objects , at first , to his marrying Phoebe , but she is soon reconciled ? and apologetic . Granted their unworldiness , their high scale of moral values , where , then , is the trace of vulgarity that is needed to make breeding bad ? They pride themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lady , ' Polly reflects . even if ' ? even if she is not rich . like the Shaws . The March girls are always consoling themselves for their vicissitudes by the fact that their parents are gentlefolk . Well , they are underbred in precisely the way in which , one fancies , the contemporaries of Emerson in Concord may well have been underbred . It is the plain-living ' side of the high thinking . ' They despised externals , and , in the end , externals had their revenge . Breeding , as such , is simply not a product of the independent village . ( Some one may mention Cranford ; but its constant awed reference to Sir Peter Arley and the county families . ' ) The villagers have not ? and who supposes that Bronson Alcott and Thoreau had it ? ? the gift of civilized contacts . A contact , be it remembered , is not quite the same thing as a relation . Manners are a natural growth of courts . Recall any mediaeval dwelling of royalty ; then imagine life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of superiors and inferiors alike ? and lived informally ! In Miss Alcott 's world , all that is changed . According to the older tradition , a totally unchaperoned youth would mean lack of breeding . Here , on  | the contrary , all the heroines are unchaperoned , while the match-making mamma is anathema . We did not cut off King Charles 's head for nothing . The reward of the unchaperoned daughter is to make a good match . In that rigid school , conventions are judged ? and nobly enough , Heaven knows ! ? from the point of view of morals alone ( of absolute , not of historic or evolutionary morals ) and many conventions are thereby damned . The result is a little like what one has heard of contemporary Norway . ' Underbred ' is very likely too strong a word ; yet one does see how the social state described in Little Women might easily shock any one brought up in a less provincial tradition . There is too much love-making , for example . Though sweethearting between fiveyear-olds is frowned on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In real life , it would not always be safe to marry , very young , your first playmate . Any one who has lived in the more modern New England village knows perfectly well that people still marry , very young , their first playmates , and that dister often results . Nor can Una always depend on the protection of a lion that is necessarily invisible . Granted that Jo 's precocious sense was right , and that it would have been a mistake for her to marry Laurie ; which of us believes that , in real life , she would not have made the mistake ? You can not depend on young things in their teens to foresee the future of their temperaments accurately . One can not but feel that if Mrs. March really saw the complete unfitness of those two for each other , it was her duty to put a few conventional obstacles in their path . Perhaps all this was part of what my friend meant by lack of breeding in the traditional sense : the social laissez-aller in extraordinary ( and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral purity . But I suspect that she referred , as well , to another aspect of Miss Alcott 's environment : to the unmistakable lack of the greater and lesser amenities of life . The plain living is quite as prominent as the high thinking . The whole tissue of the March girls ' lives is a very commonplace fabric . You know that their furniture was bad ? and that they did not know it ; that their asthetic sense was untrained and crude ? and that they did not care ; that the simplicity of their meals , their household service , their dress , their everyday manners ( in spite of the myth about Amy ) was simplicity of the common , not of the intelligent , kind . You really would not want to spend a week in the house of any one of them . Nor has their simplicity in any wise the quality of austerity . Remember the pies that the older March girls carried for muffs ( the management whereof was one of the ever-unsolved riddles of my childhood ) . No : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one must admit that there is some sense in calling Miss Alcott 's people underbred . Perhaps we do not choose to call breeding a mattar of externals . In that , we should perfectly agree with Miss Alcott 's people themselves ; and to that we shall presently come . For what is incontrovertible is that Miss Alcott 's work is a genuine document . I have spoken of the unimpeachable morality of Miss Alcott 's world . Charlie lost Rose for having drunk one glass of champagne too much . That is the worst sin committed in any of the books , so far as I remember . Of course , the black sheep , Dan , had been in prison ; but he had killed his man inevitably , almost helplessly , in self-defense ; and , besides , the treatment of Dan is purely snobbish , from start to finish . Even Mrs. Jo , while she stands by him , is acutely conscious of the social differ184 MISS ALCOTT 'S  | ence between him and her own kin . The moment he lifts his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snobbish enough , in their way . Nat , foundling and fiddler , is permitted to marry Daisy in the end ( though , really , anybody might have married Daisy ! ) . But Nat , though a parvenu , is a milksop , and is quite able to say that he has never done anything really disgraceful . The fact is that their social distinctions , while they operate socially , are yet all moral in origin . And this is a very special ' note : the bequest , it may well be , of Calvin . We ' re the elect , and you ' 11 be damned ; Hell , like a wallet , shall be crammed With God 's own reprobates . The transcendental Mr. March would never have sung it ; but he and his knew something akin to those resolute discriminations . Another point is perhaps even more interesting . There are not , I believe , any other books in the world so blatantly full of morality ? of moral issues , and moral tests , and morals passionately abided by ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Bible is never quoted ; almost no one goes to church ; and they pray only when very young and in extreme cases . The only religious allusion , so far as I know , in Little Women , is the patronizing mention of the Madonna provided for Amy by Aunt March 's Catholic maid . And even then , you can see how broad-minded Mrs. March considers herself , to permit Amy the quasioratory ; and Amy does not attempt to disguise the fact that she admires the picture chiefly for its artistic quality . Yet it is only fair to remember that , in Miss Alcott 's day , people were reading , without so much as one grain of salt , the confessions of escaped ' nuns , and the novels of Mrs. Julia McNair Wright ? and that Elsie Dinsmore developed brain fever when her father threatened to send her to a convent school . Perhaps Mrs. March had a right to flatter herself . Again , as I say . these are documents . There are many other straws to show which way the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example . have allowed her chief heroine to mare a Professor Bhaer ? No modern child ever quite recovers from the shock of it . But we must remember that , in Miss Alcott 's time , German metaphysicians were not without honor in Concord . The breath of reform , too . is hot upon the pages . Temperance ' ? remember Charlie 's unlucky glass of champagne , and Laurie 's promise to Meg on her wedding-day ; the festivals of the virtuous are a perpetual bath of lemonade . Woman Suffrage ' ? recall the discussions alluded to in The Pickwick Portfolio , ' and the fate of the few scoffers in coeducational Plumfield . The children are all passionate little Abolitionists ; and the youths are patriotic with a fervid , unfamiliar patriotism , which touches , at its dim source , emotions that to us are almost more prehistoric than historic . In the minds of Miss Alcott 's world , there is still a lively distrust of the British . They are wont to oppress their colonies , and they cheat at croquet . Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all foreigners ? except German professors . There is no prophecy of the Celtic Revival in their condescending charity to poor Irishwomen . The only people , not themselves , whom they wholly respect , are the Negroes . The rich men are nearly all East India merchants , and their money goes eventually to endow educational institutions . The young heroes have a precocious antipathy to acquiring wealth for its own sake . Demi would rather , he says , sweep door-mats in a publishing-house than go into business , like Stuffy ' and his kind . I I  | would rather be a door-keeper in the house of the Lord , ' ? it would hardly over-emphasize Demi 's so typical feeling for the sanctity of the printed page ; for the utter desirability of the publisher 's own office , where , as he says , great men go in and out , with respect . And ? to complete the evidence ? the books do not lack the note of New English austerity , though they come by it indirectly enough . The New English literary tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public , or , if it is private , it must be thwarted . There is a good deal of public passion ? for philanthropy , for education , and what-not ? in the books , after all . There is no private passion at all : though the books brim with sentiment , ? sentiment , which is eternally manifest , being perhaps a safer guess for the outsider , ? Miss Alcott writes as one who had never loved . It would be difficult to find , anywhere , stories so full of love-making and so empty of emotion . Straws show which way the wind blows ; and these straws are all borne in the same direction . Is not this the New England on which , if not in which , we were all brought up ? Any honest New Englander ? a New Englander of the villages , I mean ? will admit that the New English are singularly ungifted for social life and manners . We suspected that long ago , when we first read Miss Alcott , if we happened to turn , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Mrs. Molesworth 's stories . Imagine Jo dressed , as Mrs. Molesworth 's heroines all were , by Walter Crane ! The real oldfashioned girl ' was not Polly Milton , but Griselda , in The Cuckoo Clock . Polly was simply of no fashion at all . There was some ( wistful ? ) sense of this in us , even then . Yet of course we admitted that , in comparison , Mrs. Molesworth lacked plot ? as Heaven NEW ENGLAND 185 knows she did ! Any New Englander of the villages is familiar , too , with the passion for education ' ; a passion that , I suspect , you can match now only in the Middle West . We all know that bigoted scholarliness , in combination , precisely , with nasal and ungrammatical speech , which there is no special - point in flattering with the term idiomatic . ' One or two of Mr. Churchill 's later novels have preserved to us instances of it . We are fortunate if we have come off quite free of the superstition , so prevalent through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' book ? is sacred . We scoff heartily at the parvenu whose books are bound without first being printed ; but lam not sure that any pure-bred villager would not rather have sham books than no books at all . We can not help it . No other furniture seems to us quite so good . We have all been brought up , too , to be moral snobs . New England mothers must often be put to it to find purely moral grounds for discriminating against some of the playmates their children would ignorantly bring home . They must often yearn to say , without indirection , ' I do not wish you to play with the butcher 's little girl , and her being in your Sunday-school class makes no difference whatever : . But the real New England mother never does . She must manage it otherwise ; since the only legitimate basis for her discriminations would be some sort of proof that butchers ' little girls were apt to be naughty . The respective fates of Nat and Dan are , I dare to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official investigators of the Eugenics Society . The lack of religion , some one may object , is anything but typically New English . Perhaps , a hundred years ago , it would not have been . And we have not , to , be sure , been transcendental with impunity :  | we have the Calvinistic Unitarian . But the average New England conscience has always had a more natural turn for ethics than for pure piety . Children in Miss Alcott 's books were brought up , like ourselves , to obey their parents . It was Elsie Dinsmore , on her Southern plantation , who ( like a Presbyterian St. Rose of Lima ) defied her father for religion 's sake . Of course we all had to read about Elsie surreptitiously . We knew that without asking . There was a good deal of plain thinking , as well as of high thinking , in our and Miss Alcott 's world . As for our unworldliness : we have come a long way since Miss Alcott ; yet I verily . believe that , even now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a philosopher . So many have done it ! @# I have not done more than indicate Miss Alcott 's exceeding fidelity . Begin recalling her for yourself , and you will agree that she gives us social life as New Englanders , for decades , have . on the whole , known it . The relations of parent and child , brother and sister . community and individual , of playmates , of lovers , of citizens , are all such as we know them . They are familiar to us , if not positively our own experience . Life has grown more complicated everywhere . Yet I doubt if , even now , any New English child would instinctively call Miss Alcott 's people underbred . We still understand their code , if we do not practice it . New England is still something more than a convenient term for map-makers . These be our own villages .
