CHARLES LAMB , in his ' Grace Before Meat , ' protests ? very endearingly , it seems to me  --  against the custom of particular thankfulness for food . He suspects that it had its origin in the hunter state of man , when dinners were precarious things , and a full meal was something more than a common blessing ; when a bellyful was a windfall and looked like a special Providence. ? It is not otherwise easy to be understood , ' he avers , ' why the blessing of food ? the act of eating ? should have had a particular expression of thanksgiving annexed to it , distinct from that implied and silent gratitude with which we are expected to enter upon the enjoyment of the many other various gifts and good things of existence .

I can not discover why the blessing of these should be hailed with any very particular delight , distinct from that implied joy with which we might be expected to welcome the many other various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was because I was abnormally shy throughout my childhood that I found birthdays embarrassing , for I had no more than the usual shyness of the average child . Moreover , my surroundings and training gave me easy confidence in others and in myself . The tragedies of my little girlhood were not exceptional : dead cats or canaries , broken dolls , the 704inability to make myself always understood by grown-ups , and certain moral and spiritual failures and cataclysms known only to myself and what I took to be my fearfully disappointed Maker . But barring these things , incident and customary , my early years may be said to have been especially bright and reassuring . What was it , then , which could have caused this early distrust of birthdays ? If I am to trace the growth of what may seem so unwarranted a thing , I shall have to ask indulgence for what may appear to be some of that very egotism I decry : I shall have to ask to be allowed a discussion of several of my own birthdays , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the earliest that I remember . I had been promised a cake with candles . Moreoever , I had learned , by dint of the patience of Mademoiselle Cinque , our queer old French governess , a little French song which I was to sing , as my own share toward the festive celebration . From the shelter of my father 's arm , I was to sing it for the rest to hear : ? Tile cake , then , and the song were , from my point of view , the extraordinarily important and sufficient events of the day ? these and the fact that on that clay I would be five years old . It is certain that I chattered about these things a great deal , and laid deep plans . But , as it happened , it was neither the cake nor yet my ripe years that were to make that day so memorable . I can close my eyes and go back to it unerring , and lind myself in the old surroundings , familiar yet strange ? strange that day with an unwonted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , indeed , still ? as still as the February day outside , which lay quiet as death under a sheeted whiteness that had been drawn over it silently in the night . I can seem to feel myself actually as little as I was then , and with my doll under one arm going up the silent stairs , laboriously but resolutely pulling one leg after the other , up the length of them , with the aid of one hand on the banister spindles , to investigate for myself the strangeness . An older sister of mine , whom I loved dearly , had been ill , and for several days past I had been cautioned to gentleness and had played apart , so that quietness of a certain kind I understood . But the quietness now was of a different ? order . In the upper hall some one opened a door , at the patter of my investigating steps , I suppose ; held out a hand , stopped me in mid-search ? stopped me and kissed me and told me . My sister had died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawn was come . I do not remember who it was who told me . I remember , however , pushing myself away from the embrace a little , demanding whether I might see my mother . I was told with great gentleness that I could not . My father ? No ; him , also , I might not see ? not yet . All this sobered and puzzled me . I reached for the next , and perhaps on that clay even clearer , possibility . Might I see the cook ? Yes . That , for , a time at least , righted matters , and restored my world to me . I pattered clown the stairs , down thelower hall , then more steps ; found the cook and demanded my birthday cake ; and in place of the cake received a most shocked look , delivered in the manner of unthinkable rebuke . ' When I insisted , words came to her tongue , but not concerning the cake . They dealt wholly with myself . They conveyed the impression that . I had done some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was expected to understand and repent . I remember feeling only thoroughly outraged at having my reasonable request received in that manner . This was any clay , and , in honor of it , there was to have been a birthday cake . As to larger matters , they were extraneous to the subject . Of death , it should be remembered , I had absolutely no knowledge . I loved my sister to the full bent of my simple but ardent little nature , and she had been peculiarly devoted to me ; but ask some one who has never seen the stars or spoken with one who has seen them , what he knows of the deep firmament : so much I knew of that night which had fallen upon our house ? nothing ! IYhat I ( lid know presently ? the information being conveyed to me in unmistakable terms by the cook ? was that my birthday celebration was not to be ; that it was not only jeopardized , it was clean wilted out , by an event of immensely greater moment . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointment , and it may have taken especial tact on the part of the gentle person upstairs to pacify me ; but by and by , with that easy forgetfulness which is the better part of childhood , I must have relinquished all hope of appropriating that day as my birthday , and accepted , in place of it , life as it . was . My parents , who twice before had been summoned to bear acute loss , ? once when , before I was born , a little 766 BIRTHDAYS AND OTHER EGOTISMS baby brother of mine died , and once when the life of a little baby sister had flickered out before the flame got well started , lasted now of what must have been a. far deeper bitterness . She who had gone now was their ' extreme hope . ' She was twenty-one when she died , and within a few months of her graduation at the University . She was brilliant above any promise given by the rest of us . I remember her very clearly ? her sensitive and beautiful face , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh , and her unfailing understanding of all a little child 's desires and moods . She was exquisite , sensitive as a mimosa in it garden of sturdier growth . Above us all she seemed to stretch delicate and flowering branches , in which the wind moved more mysterious ; and lovely winged and songful things that we could never have hoped to harbor , seemed to have made their home in her . There was in her sonic-thing rare and unlooked for ( I do not exaggerate ) , like the sudden call of a thrush in the twilight , or delicate and darkling , as in starlight the song of the nightingale . She was the one reckoned to be most like my father , and by the generous , and , I think , even proud consent of all of us , was by him the most beloved . She was as devoted as Cordelia , and with lesser cause , bringing to the happiness and fullness of his life what Lear knew only in his desolation . Since I have grown into what is at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my father , I can not touch without a trembling of tears the memory of his taking me in his arms as he did , to look upon her as she lay , white and final , delicate and done with life , there in the still and shuttered room . But , incredible though it seems to my present knowledge , I had then no feeling of sadness whatever . She mighthave slept . Nor did the days that followed lay heavy hands upon me . There was a quiet stir and hushed preparation toward what I did not know , and I was looked after by neighbors or relatives to the extent of believing that a certain pleasant distinction accrued to me . In all that followed , I know that I contributed no sadness , only a child 's frank observation in the face of unusual behavior of its elders . But to return to the birthday . It was a remarkable one , you see , linked with all these things , allied to such large sorrows ? a sad one and disappointing enough , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not find it so . I was , as I have told you , indignant as to the cake , and disappointed , no doubt , that there was no happy and devoted family now gathered to hear me sing my gay little song . But to offset these there was a kind of reassurance in the day which I find it difficult to describe very exactly . It was as though , at one and the same time , this were and were not my birthday . It was my clay by the calendar , but in no other way . For a birthday is one whose dawn and sunset are one 's very own , a day when one 's importance is admitted very gladly by a certain intimate circle . But on no day of my life , I am sure , was I of so little importance as then ? a very inconsiderable little person , playing alone in the sunshine and with my song unsung . Yet something in that clay shines now across the years , as distant as a star , as silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascribed to any one mere incident : it was compounded , no doubt , of the best of every relationship which I felt that day for the first time . The extreme gentleness of the grown-up of whom I have told you was one element ; the companionship with my father in that strange still moment in the shuttered room ; the wordless love given me by my mother , of a different sort from any she had gi Veil me before ; the quietness , giving me an impression es of remote spaces never dreamed of before ; and , over all , the sense of something strange and of a great dignity , as of presences that moved , dread , but not unkindly . And the lit tle song I had pract iced so faithfully , and which I was to have sung ! Little as I was , and without ever being told , I believe as t he day wore on I must have had a dim realization of how inconsiderable it was in that house where Death had taken up Life 's lute , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life had sung . 11 The birthdays that followed on this one were curiously unsatisfying , though they were celebrated appropriately enough , and with the fullest respect . for my importance . The anticipation and approach of them , as nearly as I can remember , were clear joy . But the days , when they arrived , overwhelmed inc unaccountably . There was something disproportionate in them , so that I was glad to escape from their too personal glory to the more comfortable and commonplace of the impersonal . It was as though I guessed dimly , without being in the least aware , that this display in my honor had in it something almost a little cheap ? an egotism ( though I had not then so much as heard the word ) which contrasted unfavorably with the large and gracious and forgetful ways of Life itself . I believe my embarrassment , my wholly unanalyzed sense of disappointment and disproportion , may have been , on a very diminutive scale , something akin to that which I am sure Joshua must have experienced , ? not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flattering command , ? no , but aft erwards , afterwards , in the disappointed watches of the night , when he must have reflected , with disappointed amazement , that , if his senses deceived him not , he , Joshua , had made the great luminary to stand still over Gibeon , and the moon in the valley of Ajalon . Something , too , of what Joseph must have experienced , ? not . in the enjoyable dream of his brothers ' sheaves bowing down to his sheaf , and the sun and the moon and the eleven stars making their obeisance to him ; nor in those long anticipatory years , when his greatness was approaching , and the scroll of the future hung loose in his hands for his remembering eye to read , no , but in I he actual moment of overwhelming fulfillment. , when , from Judah to Ilenjamin , his brothers actually did bow down to him as ruler over all those great granaries of Egypt , and , as we are told , his mature spirit could not consent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and entered into his chamber and wept there . ' These are , I believe , no mere extraneous or personal experiences , but are rather of the fine weave and fabric of humanity ; and the uneasiness I felt in my complacent little soul I now believe to have been a stirring of old things , of ancient memories tinder the moon , which linked my lilt le inconsiderable life , as they link all lives , to Egypt , Nilus , Babylon , and the ages that are not . But lest this seem but vague argument and debatable ground , I would like to speak of other childhood birthdays of my own which , it seems to me , bring to the case clear evidence and important testimony . I have said that I was one of a large family . happily we could not make too important a matter of birthdays in our home ; it would have kept us celebrating most of the time , and would deleted material younger ones , a gracious bending down of her life to ours for a little while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some with gray hairs , came and bowed over the hand of fifteen . That impressed me most . And some who were a little more than guests ? intimates brought my sister gifts ? one that lies here now on the table as I write : a beautifully bound small copy of Shakespeare 's Sonnets , with the Dowden introduction . I did not know it then for what it was . I only loved it for its red and gold binding ; but later , I grew up to it in my girlhood , as a young vine climbs at last to a trellis that is placed above it and awaits its growing . On its first leaf , in an exact hand , is written the date , my sister 's name , and that of the donor . Then follows this wish , suitable to the day : May each succeeding birthday find you as light-hearted as you are to-day . ' Oh , time ! time ! that brings us our blunders and our tears ! Was he so inexperienced himself , he who brought her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere spirit of carnival and bravado , just because she was fifteen on the fifteenth , and nothing else was for the moment to be admitted of any impor-tance ? I do not know how beautiful a birth-clay it was for her , but oh , for me ! How I loved it ! How good it was to bring her my homage ! How glad and willing and eager I was that she should stand first ! Play , play , concealed musicians ! I can still catch the plucking of the harp-strings , and the sweet gay wailing of the violins , across the years . III One other birthday of my childhood stands out vividly in my metnory : that one on which I was twelve years old . My mother had taken us all abroad , to widen our horizons and promote our voL . Ceducation . After a preliminary few months in England , we were established in Paris , in a comfortable apartment in a little hotel which they tell me is still there , and which went then , and still goes , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the moment of our arrival in January , I began to think even more of my birthday than was my wont . This was , no doubt , largely clue to the fact that at the distance of a few blocks one way or another , anything in the world , so it seemed , could be bought . Shops ! Shops ! The rue des Petits Champs , t he Avenue de POpha , the Boulevard des Italiens , were full of then . The rue des Petits Champs had innumerable boutiques of all kinds ? one given over to nothing , mind you , but honey and gingerbread , like a shop in a fairy tale . If you went across the Place Vendome and followed the rue Castiglione , you came to the most romantic shops of all , there under the arcades of the rue de Rivoli , beginning with the most delectable pastry shop in the world on the very corner . You could walk there on a sunny clay , disdainful of the weather , with the Gardens of the Tuileries opposite you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when all was said , there was nothing that could be compared with the shops of the rue de la Paix . Here you came at once into a richer at mosphere . Here , mainly , were jewel-shops , displaying tiaras and necklaces ? ' rings and things and fine array . ' Dolls and gingerbread and honey were delightful ? let me not seem to undervalue them ; but to stand looking on while a master of his profession leaned over a velvet counter to show my mother brooches of jewels , and diamonds set in rings , was to know from the standpoint of childhood some of the true elevations of life . While my mother considered jewels set thus or so , my eyes roved , speculative , among the rich wares . I had been brought up in too old-fashioned a way to make any mistake as to my limitations . Well-bred children , it was understood , wore neither rings nor ornaments , unless one or two of a most positive simplicity . But watches there were , a bewildering variety  --  for we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among other distinctions that . I doubt not he had , was Horloger de la Marine . ' You can imagine whether he had watches ! I called my mother 's attention to the beauty of them , some very small ones in particular . She looked at them , but made no comment . I deduced that . it was not well-bred for a little girl of twelve to wear a watch . My birthday dawned at last . I was kissed and wished many happy returns , and was told that there was to be it dinner that night especially for me , and that I would then receive my gifts . The hotel was a small one . Dinner would be served for the hotel guests a trifle earlier , so that they might the sooner leave the way clear for me . This had been proposed by Madame Met herself , the proprietress , and was intended no doubt for a fine piece of hospitality . For me the strict hotel rules were to be slackened ; the fine democracy of hotel life , where one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay his account , was to be overruled in my favor ; for me the sums was to he advanced , and the moon set at a new pace in the heavens ! It was very grand in anticipation , I can assure you . To be twelve was of itself no inconsiderable glory , but to be twelve under such flattering conditions ! I resolved to write an account of all this to my two chums in America . Little girls they were , of my own age , but of a less colored experience . They should have news of these matters . They should be enlightened as to the importance of her with whom they had commonly played visiting-lady and jack-stones . Yet , as the evening drew near , old stirrings of uneasiness made themselves felt dimly , dimly ? something , I can not tell you what , moving on the face of undiscovered waters ; a distrust , a shyness and embarrassment . that had nothing to do with timidity ; it dim sense of disproportion , I take it to have been , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual hour , and then there came a knock . Joseph , our waiter , appeared and bowed gravely . ' Mademoiselle , le diner est. servi . ' My heart rose and fluttered . Pre . Sently we all went down the hall and down the red carpeted stairs , I with my hand in my mother 's . I can still feel it resting I here . Down the steps we went , my mot her and I , I with a little delighted pause and poise at each step , the rest following like a court . train . Twelve , and the youngest ! Twelve , and the well-beloved and proud ! Blow , bugles , fine and high ! and let those who follow wear scarlet ! What more could a little girl ask ? I do not know ; I can not tell you . I only know that , though I would not have admitted it . for worlds at the time , when I found myself in the midst of the happiness , it was no longer happiness exactly . Not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the splendor then . It fascinated me , of course . Joseph held the door open ; a fine heraldic gesture ? the flat of his palm against it , the fingers spread , his head flung back , his eyes tributary ahead of him ; his whole pose saying , ' Stand back ! She comes ! ' Several of the other servants were there , grouped to see and to attend . Madame Blet , in her black dress and perpetual shoulder-cape , ? a sad-faced , very dignified woman , with the sadness set aside in my honor for that evening and positive brightness shining from her kind eyes , ? stood there too , with welcoming glances . She had decorated the table herself : there it was , a delight of soft lights and snowy linen , wonderful possibilities and flowers . The dining-room was empty yet bright , as are the heavens for the coining of the moon . Joseph stood , not . back of my mother 's chair , as usual , but back of mine , to see me seated . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned toward me , a little gay , and happy wholly in my happiness . It was fulfillment of all the dreams of importance I might ever have had . I Then came the unfolding of the gifts . Any one who knew my mother must know that in the smallest of a nest of lovely little boxes ? just enough of them to produce a certain curiosity and delay , to enhance the final delight ? lay the most lovely little watch , silver-cased ( to render it more conformable to my age ) , and marked with initials of my name ; while on its inner casing it bore proudly , as it still bears , while it ticks here on my table , this inscription : Victor Fleury , Ilorloger de la Marine , 23 Rue de la Paix , d3 , Paris . After the other gifts were opened dinner was served , Joseph bringing everything first to me , whose place it was usually to be served last of all . There were special dishes , and the lamb-chops had on particularly fine cravats , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly a shame to cat them , like ' good little Tootletumtay ' in the ballad ; and there were side dishes , very special , for the occasion . Then , as a crowning glory , a dessert not baked in a hotel oven at all ; no cabinet pudding of frequent occurrence , nothing that hinted of rice or raisins ; no , but something fetched particularlyfrom the pdlisserie . By the look of it , it might have been , and probably was , concocted by a pastry cook in full regalia , in that superlative mitisserie on the rue de Itivoli , opposite the Louvre . It was a tower made of a hard brown candy flecked with chopped nuts . It had a door in it , and windows with embrasures at the tops to make you think of king Arthur and his knights . It was decorated on its plat ter by saccharine approaches . The tower was open at the top and filled with a flavored whipped cream . Madame Illet , who had , I doubt not , been directing forces from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candle . This , which had the added flavor of being a surprise even to my mother , was Madame Ilia 's gift . to the little American mademoiselle . Once more , on a most diminutive scale , France and America were exchanging courtesies . But meanwhile , ? oh , inevitable ! ? Joseph , that devoted ambassador , beaming unfeigned pride in the behavior of his country , held the tower at my left . hand . I was to serve myself first . But how ? I ask the heavens to answer me this ! how is one to serve one 's self to a feudal tower ? One desperate glance at my mother , ? the quick dart of an alarmed swallow , ? then I took up the large spoon and laid it hesitatingly against the tower 's side . But the tower was nearly as hard as the rock it represented . The approaches , also , were of one piece . With a mere dessert spoon , what can be done as to a portcullis ! Shall you , do you think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be held in one hand ? I was not meeting the emergency . I was not equal to the occasion . This I knew with quick intolerable shame . What was to be done ! At last , after what seemed to me ages , I accepted the only possibility . I scooped from the top of the tower sonic of the fluffy whipped 772 BIRTHDAYS AND OTHER EGOTISMS cream , put this on my plate and the spoon back among the approaches ; and the tower , proud , unspoiled , un won , was carried on to the others , who served themselves , as I had done ; or , when the cream was at last too low for them to reach , suffered Joseph to scoop it out for them and put it on their plates . I sat tasting the whipped cream on the end of my spoon , and oh , it was insipid , that faint froth ; not of itself , but by contrast with what I would have wished ? a portcullis at the very least . When we left the dining-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable tower , a delusion to the palate , a snare to the understanding , a subtle but strong disappointment to the heart ! Now that I look back on it , it seems like an unintended symbol , an un in t erpreted writing on the wall of my child hood . These things called birthdays seemed for me to have been weighed that night in subtle scales , and found wanting . Froth on the tip of your spoon ! The real anticipated glory a chimera ; the dreamed-of and so-much-desired happiness a thing which could not be won , a thing left untouched while one slipped away unsatisfied , disappointed , into the later years . No doubt I passed on to later years that very evening as I went out of the lighted dining-room , for more and more this centralizing of power and importance , even though it were for one day of the year only , became to me incongruous and out of the real order of life . As I began to gauge values and proportions better , it came to seem almost a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthdays in my little girlhood was beginning to take on the form of posit ive distaste . Doubtless I was beginning to have a larger vision of life . For one thing , I had meanwhile seen dawns rise over the Alps , and day depart from the fruitfulpurple valleys to ascend the heights , beautiful , like the feet of those upon the mountains , who bring tidings of peace ; and had watched them pause in their glory for a last look upon the work of their hands before going forth forever beyond the world 's edge . And I had stood since then by the incredible sounding sea ; I had known that sense of the waters in the hollow of his hand , and watched the night bend like the face of infinity over it . IV Out of the birthdays I have known , I have recorded but three ? the three made memorable , not so much by material as by spiritual gifts , and by some vision of life itself vouchsafed me . It was as though , with a touch upon my hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some unrealized way , when I was but a child of five , how inconsiderable may be these our little personal joys and expectations and vanities of song , even as were mine , in the face of the large solemnities and griefs and remembered joys with which , that . day , our home was visited . And on that second birthday , it was as though Life bade me note how satisfying to the heart , is the gift of lovely and willing service . Not mine the clay at all , but I can remember , all woven in with the ravishing music of harps and violins , a sense of my almost thrilled delight in the service that others brought my sister , in whose honor we were glad , and a high joy in my own eager and devoted homage . Dimly seen in all this , though I could not have named it to you then , was a larger vision , no doubt , of this same truth translated into lovelier and more solemn meaning ; as though in those lighted roans , gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid a touch on my shoulder , and with her finger on her lips had bade // me note how sweet is the odor of spikenard and how thrillingly beautiful are the broken pieces of alabaster . And the third birthday ? Perhaps it was then that Life put into my hand a better gift than any ? that larger knowledge , which all the coming years were to corroborate , that to have special gifts and benefits for one 's self which are not for others , let the glamour be what it may , is after all but froth and disappointment ; and that only the blending of one 's life with other lives can ever really satisfy the heart . Since then I have seen birthdays of my own and others not a few , and have looked on at those of many a child . Witnessing these , I have sometimes been troubled to note how ? materialists ourselves ? we insist upon making materialists of our children also . For who has not beheld a little lad , triumphant as Jack Horner , in the midst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among his heaped-up Christmas toys , appropriating to himself , with our delighted consent , the Other Child 's birthday also . With what shameful abundance of material gifts do we heap the little eager hands ; but how few , how few , for the young and growing spirit ! Yet it is to be noted hopefully that our too personal celebrations are apt to fall away , as it were of themselves , in our later years ; and doubtless with them many of our central egotisms , life correcting with a patient hand our dull and oftentimes willful behavior . I can not be persuaded that it is solely a sensitiveness to the loss of youth that prompts us to waive or disregard those birthdays which fall upon the nether side of twenty . Our neglect of them is more often , I like to believe , in the order of a gentle disavowal of old egotisms , as life ripens and takes on in our regard an aspect larger and less personal ; even as to a nation or a religionwhich progresses , egotism and special privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people more and more intolerable to the pure at heart as the world matures . Mature life , like the mature heart , can not endure a sovereignty over its brethren , but longs for the old original levels ; sheds its singleness and its supe- ies . We become , God be thanked , less considerable under the moon as time advances ; more of a piece with life ; better blended with the days ; a part of all dawns and sunsets we who before had but one of each to our credit . I own that I am disposed to say grace upon twenty other occasions in the course of a day besides my dinner , ' says Lamb . ' I want a form for set ting out upon a pleasant walk , for a moonlight ramble , for a friendly tweeting , or a solved problem . Why have we none for books , those spiritual repasts ? a grace before Milton ? a grace before Shakespeare ? a devotional exercise proper to be said before reading the " Fairy Queen " ? ' I own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , and am inclined to be thankful on twenty other occasions in the course of the year besides that one which falls so personally for me  --  even if so negligible ? on a certain February morning , I confess to a love of calendars which sometimes give me two or three great names to celebrate in a single day ; nor am I ashamed to admit that the sun rises for me the statelier if it be upon an anniversary which commemorates Camoens or Michael Angelo . It has long been my habit to celebrate quietly in my heart , when all the birds are singing , that day in April when , it is said ? uncertainly enough ? Shakespeare came to the earth ; nor have I failed often to note t hat other day also , when , impartially in the same April 774 THE TRUE STORY OF BLUEBEARD weather , it is said , he ? and Cervantes on the same day with him  --  departed from it . And if such remembrances as these may seem still to tend toward egotism , yet I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these , ? celebrate them as personally as we ! nay , ? these are not men of one season but of all time , blended with all days , impartially a part of all weathers , and of the very fibre and lives of most of us ; and , even though we should forget them , yet memorably forgot ten in those unforgettable companionships that they have bestowed upon us . These are our stars and moons , differing in glory one from another , with which , in the midst of our mortality , we answer not ignobly the shining challenge of the stars ; these are they innumerable whose beauties and nobilities coupled with our own inconsiderable lives , lend at lastsome glory to our days so frail , so ephemeral . As a child , fused to love to count the stars , beginning with the very first one that pricked its way through the twilit blue , and by a pretty conceit always called that first one my own , and put a most personal wish upon it . For a long time it always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or there , and there , and there , appeared , which I counted with delight . But always the moment came when the count was irretrievably lost ; when stars bloomed , not by ones and twos but by myriads , no more to be counted than the unnumbered sands of the sea ; and over me was stretched the jeweled beauty of the infinite heavens , just breathing with the breathing of the night ; and I , looking up glorified into that beauty , a little inconsiderable child , standing beside the soft dark shadow of the cypresses.
