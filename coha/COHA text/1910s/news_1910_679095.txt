txt In its latest bulletin , the Congress Committee of One HunWas dred on National Health , Deceived . besides making a clear statement of what a Federal Department of Health would now or soon be doing had Congress heeded the well-nigh unanimous demand of the country 's real doctors and sanitarians and passed the Owen bill , convicts the socalled League for Medical Freedom of very serious misrepresentation in claiming to have in its antagonism to that excellent measure the support of all the " irregulars . " While it is probably true that representatives of all or most of the groups thus described gave more or Less countenance to this ebsurd guardian of liberties which nobody had dreamed of restricting , it seems that in doing so some of them took in ignorance and haste action which they have since regretted , and that the ho. - neopathists are especially troubled that they should have been grouped as a body with such people as the osteopaths and the Eddyites as opponents of the bill , Their organization in this county has with only a single dissenting voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed department on the ground that it " will increase the efficiency of State Boards of Health and produce a unanimity which is essentially lacking under the present conditions . " The North American Journal of Homeopathy , too , has editorially indorsed the Owen bill and advised its readers to favor it with their influence . The Committee of One Hundred also deems it worth whsle to state that leaders among the osteopathists and the Christian Scientists resent and repudiate tha use made by the leaguers of the names of their cults and deny that there has peen any excuse for this except the ill-advised action of a few misguided members . It is evidently still the belief of the committee that underlying and explaining the activities of the league are " commercial interests "  --  the druggists and the manufacturers of proprietary medicines  --  and their fear that somehow or other the proposed department would " regulate , " not the practice of medicine , but a business that is equally profitable to those who conduct it and injurious to the public health and pocket . Whatever may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cr another that would attain its designed ends , ought to be passed , and it makes little difference who opposes the plan , for the arguments against it are all either ! Rise or empty . As information acTreachery cumulates in regard to IS Worse the Griswold breach-ofThan Folly . promise suit , the mere outrageous is seen to have been the conduct of the man who brought it and the greater is the difficulty of delaying the application to him of epithets even more indicative Of disgust than of indignation . We spoke yesterday of the possibility that the letters he received and so carefully preserved might prove his miserable case for him  --  might , that is , support his contention that a promise of marriage had been made and broken . Apparently there is no such passibility . Unless the letters still to be printed are very different from those that have already appeared , he will be able to prove nothing at all except the betrayal by himself of a kind friend 's amiable weakness and her folly in assuming that he would observe and respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the wisest of women has been revealed plainly enough , as has been the Tact that she chose to amuse her too large leisure in a way that never fails to end in embarrassments of one sort or another and not infrequently leads out of comedy into tragedy . " On ne ba , dine pas avec l'amoura , ' however , IA a doctrine that has been preached by many a who heeded it'asalittle asdid Atz  --  Aum 111tissiZT , its most eminent exponent , and so few have learned the lesson otherwise than by frequent and painful experience that the victims of its neglect deserve at least as much of sympathy as of reproof . It would be too much to hope , probably , that this episode will serve as an effective warning as to the danger of writing to untrustworthy people letters which will cause confusion to the author if they reach others than the intended reader . Perhaps it should not do so . Life would be intolerable ? it would be almost impossible ? if one had to treat everybody as likely some day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the rights and wrongs of this particular case have already been decided , and against the plaintiff on his own presentation of it . Unfortunately , he is probably incapable of feeling the only Punishment he Is sure to receive  --  the contempt of all who hear his story , In other days here , and in other places still , he would not escape so easily . According to a report Westchester that is credible enough , Resents the banks in Westchester County have the Charge . decided that the people living there have borrowed for the purpose of buying automobiles about as much money as it is safe to lend them , and that hereafter applicants for such " accommodation " will be suavely but firmly discouraged . Whether , as these financial censors are said to have declared , Westchester is " auto crazy " or not , Is , of course , a matter of opinion , but it is a fact that the ' machines are extremely numerous up in that pleasant land , and that the question how some of their owners can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a little automobile has often been asked by others than bankers . In a good many cases , however , the extravagance is more apparent than real . It costs money to run an automobile , but the running also prevents some other ex-i penditures , and there is no loss in substituting one pleasure for another . At least ? there may not be , and judging from the ' moans that are rising in chorus from the , purveyors of older joys and luxuries , the ' automobile is often  --  to some extent always ? a diversion of resources rather than an added drain upon them . It must be remembered , too , that keeping an automobile on one 's own little I place In the suburbs , caring for and operating it one 's self , is a very different thing from paying garage charges in the city and a chauffeur 's salary and commissions . Perhaps , everything considered , the Westchester banks are unnecessarily or unduly worried                 @ @ @ @
