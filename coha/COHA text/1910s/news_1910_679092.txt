txt It was remarked last March that the banking situation in the country at large was somewhat extended , although the leading cities , and particularly New York , had taken in sail . The aggregated reports of all the National banks of the United States now show that the situation in that respect is unaltered . Loans are a trifle larger , reserves a trifle smaller , the alterations in both respects being too small for specification . If the comparison is made with this time a year ago the deterioration is more serious . Loans are $394,000,000 larger , despite some reductions in the chief centres , and reserves are lower by 1.15 per cent . In other words , the situation is almost immobile under the efforts of the past few months . It is interesting to note what the banks did when they found their loans unmanageable . Naturally they called in their resources . Accordingly we find that all National banks owe to other banks $87,000,000 less than three months ago , and $134 , - 000,000 less than a year ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an unusual manner and to an exceptional degree . Bills payable and rediscounts now total almost sixty millions , an increase since March of $28,000,000 , and since June last year of $35,500,000 . It is the volume of these entries which is remarkable , for there are always rediscounts and temporary accommodations between banks . Analysis between sections is as revealing as by items . New York is the only central reserve city which is above the legal 25 per cent reserve , and even New York 's condition is below the statement of last Spring or last Summer . The explanation is as obvious as the deterioration , and was suggested by the figures above . The interior banks began strengthening themselves exceptionally early and vigorously . This city 's shipments of currency to the country were a maximum , and they have gone where they would do most good . Of seventeen Middle and Western States only four show smaller reserves than in March , and three-quarters of the Southern States show improvement . Declines are most marked in the Pacific section . The situation is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The waste of resources is the chief indictment of our banking system . We stopped payment in 1907 when the banking resources would have sustained a much larger volume of business . The demonstration of real wealth , and reserve force . and essential economic soundness , is humiliating when compared with the breakdown of cash payments , which are the first duty of a banker , and without which all other virtues are of no avail . On the face of the figures almost the same barbaric strength exists now , but below the surface all is not equally well . The reserves are adequate , excessive if available . But they are scattered , not massed . And under our system reserves are servants of all work , instead of guardians of convertibility . It is almost a crime to move the crops with bank reserves , and disturb the security markets and the credit situation year after year for the recurring harvest strain . And we are learning that it is not a simple question of reserves . They merely hold the fort while reinforcements are brought up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank assets are not liquid . The banks hold $700,000,000 of Government . bonds which are unsalable without loss , and without disturbance of the currency situation . They hold $350,000,000 of other investments , bonds and securities of unspecified descriptions . The loans are in control of the banks , rather than the banks in control of the loans . How different would the situation be if some two billions of resources were at the service of commerce , rather than upholding the investment market . Let this be borne in mind when next it is proposed to authorize National banks to make - real estate loans . The situation is just sufficiently cautionary to be wholesome . It is idle to expect much reduction of Fanners ' loans until the next MFarch settlements . The farmers , if they appreciate these figures , will see that they must take care of their loans themselves , and not rely upon the burdened banks . The irderPretation of this is that the farm : gan must sell their crop ; and not hold them for a rise . The banks neither can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been guilty of while abusing the Exchange operators . It is true that the farmer is a merchant , and has every right to be his own judge of the markets when he is using his own money . It is different when he is using bank reserves which the country needs . The proper meaning of these bank figures is that the crops should be moved with exceptional swiftness this year . There could not be a better augury.
