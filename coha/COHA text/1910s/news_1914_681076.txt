txt " The first thing we do , let 's kill all the lawyers . " This amiable sentiment and counsel of perfection is the ut ? terance of Dick the butcher , the pal of Jack Cade . Lawyers have not improved from that day to this , but they can plead in extenuation that they no longer make the laws . The people are the lawmakers now , and Dick 's counsel properly is applicable nowadays to the lawmakers rather than to the lawyers . There was only one Jack Cade in Shakespeare , but the modern Jack Cades are many and they are as liberal with other people 's possessions as the original . It has been thought that the bread line , formed in New York alone . But there is a queue at every capital , and nothing comes amiss . In Kentucky and Missouri cheaper insurance rates are the " hand outs . " At Washington the heads of the trusts are served on chargers . At Albany the platters are heaped with half fare for street cars , five-cent telephone tolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing for cars or haulage . Excuses are ample , if indeed any are needed , beyond the gratification of the people 's desires . Dividends are " estimated " at 20 per cent . and the rates are halved . The wicked corporations ought to rejoice that the estimate was notA0 per cent . dividends and quarter rates . The people are in the saddle alongside of Jack , and the King can do no wrong . Every statute made by the sovereign is right until a later and better one is written . Whatever else is doubtful , it is sure men of business are rascals . There is not a section of business which is not " regulated " against its will . Whole sections of business abandon business in a body in protest against intolerable laws . Beards of Trade and Chambers of Commerce - " resolute " in vain . Bankers are explicitly notified that their counsel is not wanted , and the laws they want are refused . Any business man knows that the percentage of rascals in bust . pegs is smaller than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . Combinations of rascals can not hold together . They wrangle and quarrel in the manner that the Politicians are exemplifying now at every Capitol , without regard to the subject of their differences . The only enduring human relations are those based on honesty and good faith , Practical business men are nearer statesmen than legislators are near being business men . Men of business know what is possible and what is not possible . Politicians think that anything is possible which cap be voted , or the promise of which will keep them in office . This age of combination has taught men of business to think in units of nations and international relations . The small men of affairs today are the lawmakers who are still engaged in provincial or parochial intrigues , mere efforts to get something at the expense of somebody else , in the firm belief that those whose pockets are picked will not know It . The legislators think that they are the czars of morals as well as economics , and that the world would not be honest without their statutes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that they remain honest in spite of the Statutes instead of because of them . There are scandals in business just as there are in all human relations . But there is no scandal in business comparable to the dry rot in our Legislatures.
