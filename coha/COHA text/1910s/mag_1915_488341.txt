So far as the theatre is concerned , it may certainly be said that England 's need is America 's opportunity . Putting musical plays and mere transpontine melodrama aside , there are at present ten London theatres appealing to what may be called the reasonably intelligent public ; and of these five are occupied by American plays . Beside two great English successes , " Quinneys ' " and " The Man Who Stayed at Home , " we may place two still greater American successes , " Potash &; Perlmutter " and " Peg o ' My Heart . " The American detective play is represented , on its melodramatic side , by " Kick In " ; on its humorous , not to say farcical , side by " The Dummy . " " On Trial , " after a good run , has recently disappeared from the bills ; but last night witnessed a new importation in the shape of Mr. Edward Sheldon 's " Romance . " It is pleasant to record that Miss Doris Keane made a great and incontestable success , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of work , though one would be sorry to regard it as the best that can be looked for from the author of " Salvation Nell " and " The Nigger . " Apart from " The Big Drum , " there has been only one English production this autumn of the slightest pretensions . The author of " The Ware Case , " at Wyndham 's Theatre , is announced on the playbill as " George Pleydell " ; but there IS no secret about the fact that he is really Mr. George Pleydell Bancroft , son of the manager and manageress , who were in many ways the true pioneers of the dramatic revival . At the old Prince of Wales 's Theatre they produced in the sixties the comedies of T. W. Robertson , and after Robertson 's death they fell back , in the seventies , upon elaborately mounted and admirably acted adaptations of Sardou . The family tradition is strong ? in Mr. " George Pleydell " ; but , unfortunately , it is the Sardou , not the Robertson , strain that he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blood ; and in " The Ware Case " he has produced a reasonably interesting detective play , marred , on the side of character and emotion , by Sardouish superficiality and insincerity . There is a certain originality in the conception of Sir Hubert Ware . He is a Wicked Baronet , indeed , but not quite of the ordinary type . Though absolutely devoid of moral scruples , he is superficially charming , amiable , and generous . Everybody likes him except those who know him well . He has made his wife miserable by his flagrant infidelities ; he has gambled away all his fortune , and he tries to possess himself fraudulently of a few thousand pounds belonging to Lady Ware . Baffled in this by the intervention of a great lawyer who chivalrously adores the much-wronged lady , Sir Hubert sees only one means of escape from disaster . His wife has a younger brother , a contemptible worm of a boy , to whom their father has left almost all his huge fortune . If the boy were out of the way , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , watching his opportunity while Master Eustace is bathing , knocks him on the head with an oar , so that he sinks and is drowned . For some months the murder is undiscovered . Lady Ware pays her husband 's debts , but , his conduct in nowise Improving , she announces : to him that she will no longer live in his house . Immediately on the heels of this final breach between them , the minions of the law arrive to arrest Sir Hubert on suspicion of having murdered his brother-in-law ; and here , where the interest of plot begins , the interest of character unfortunately breaks down . From the first , Lady Ware has not particularly cared for her husband , and she has long seen through his superficial amiability and realized his utter worthlessness . She cordially detests him , and has just told him so in the plainest terms . But the accusation of murder causes the most amazing revulsion in her feelings . Had Romeo been arrested for the slaying of Tybalt , at the moment of his descent from Juliet 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on " more tragically than does Lady Ware . We can not but ask ourselves : if she is so heartbroken over the arrest of a man she abhors , what would she " doif a s , milar misfortune overtook a man she loved ? The whole treatment of the situation is thoroughly false . That she should believe him innocent and try her best to save him is probable enough  --  not that she should throw herself into his defence with a frenzy of conviction that could not have been surpassed if he had been the most admirable man and adorable husband in the world . The position , in itself , is interesting enough . Many answers might be given to the question : what would a woman do under the circumstances ? Mr. Pleydell , for the sake of giving his heroine some strongly emotional and " sympathetic " scenes , has picked out the one thing she certainly would not do ; and this falsity vitiates all the latter half of his play . The third act consists of the trial scene , fairly well staged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mr. Galsworthy 's " Justice , " as mounted by Granville Barker . Of course , Sir Hubert is defended by Lady Ware 's chivalrous adorer : that is imperatively demanded by the Sardou tradition . it so happens that , immediately before the murder , a broken-down jockey called to beg Sir Hubert to assist him , and Sir Hubert , in his good-natured way , gave him the last five-pound note he had in the world . This man now comes forWard and perjures himself gallantly in his benefactor 's defence , with the result that he is acquitted by the skin of his teeth . The jockey 's examination and cross-examination are interesting enough , and the trial as a whole is not ineffective . But now it is Sir Hubert 's turn to develop unexpected and bewildering traits of character . Hitherto we have taken him for a born criminal , brazen , insouciant , stoical , and without a nerve in his body . But behold ! no sooner does he come home after his acquittal than his nerve utterly breaks down , he drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a gibbering maniac , confesses his crime and takes a dose of prussic acid . Surely , the - last act demanded both by logic and by human nature was utterly different from this , and immeasurably more effective . It might run somewhat as follows : Lady Ware and her Bayard barrister have done their best for Sir Hubert and got him off , thereby placing an insuperable obstacle in the way of their high-winded affections . Sir Hubert comes home , and his wife , in view of Elie ordeal he has gone through , feels that it is perhaps her duty to try to forget the past and begin a new life with him . The scene of quasi-reconciliation between them might be most interesting . Then some incautious word of Sir Hubert 's should reveal to her his guilt ; or , perhaps  --  though this would be more commonplace  --  the jockey should enlighten her by turning up to claim the reward of his hard swearing . What the actual end should be we need not speculate ; but I am sure that even Sardou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making Sir Hubert break down , get drunk , and blab . I do not know whether the name of the late George Edwardes was familiar to the American public , but many of his productions were as successful on your side as they were here . He used to say that he looked to the provinces and America to recoup him for the very heavy initial outlay involved in his system of management , which left him a very small margin of profit on the London run of his " shows . " His career illustrates the obvious and yet often neglected fact that , when a form of art is at the same time an article of commerce , it must always tend to express the tastes and predilections of the man whose commercial ability gives him the control of the machine . In the theatrical trade there are fortunately a good many men who combine business aptitude with an honest prefer . ence for the better class of work , and an ambition to do the best of which circumstances will allow . If this were not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The late Mr. Charles Frohman , though his tastes were not fastidious , was a " sportsman " after his fashion , willing and eager to experiment in every type and grade of play . But Mr. Edwardes confined himself to one type of play  --  the light musical production  --  and he impressed it with the stamp of his own personality and his own limitations . He approached the theatre entirely from the business  --  the box-office  --  side . He began as business manager for Mr. D'Oyly Carte in the early days of the Gilbert and Sulllivan successes . Then he went over to Mr. John Hollingshead at the Gaiety , a cynical and rather futile impresario , who was fond of comparing his trade to that of the cheese-monger , and therein flattered it rather than otherwise . The " Gaiety burlesque " which Mr. Edwardes found in possession of the field was an appallingly inept form of entertainment , which subsisted entirely on the talents of a little group of comedians and on the pink silk fleshings which were then the statutory garb of the chorus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been seriously shaken by the vogue of Gilbert and Sullivan , and Mr. Edwardes , on coming into power , swept it away altogether . So much must be accounted unto him for righteousness , though he probably did nothing more than recognize , what was pretty patent to everybody , that the " leg show " had had its day . What share he took in the actual invention of the form of entertainment which superseded it , I do not know , and perhaps no one does . Certain it is that , in the early nineties , the so-called " musical comedies " took possession of the stage , and maintained their popularity for something like fifteen years . It is with this form of entertainment that the name of George Edwardes will always be associated in the footnotes to theatrical history . Meilhac and- Flalevy had to some extent anticipated " musical comedy " in " La Vie Parisienne " ; but it is not to be supposed that the librettists of the nineties went so far back for their inspiration . Indeed , when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tights , the idea of presenting them in gowns of modern cut , though of somewhat accentuated color , lay ready to hand . And that was the " differentia " of the type . It purported to present ? scenes of modern life  --  fast life for preference  --  with an intermixture of songs and dances , and with a " beauty chorus " always in. evidence . Now , this was in itself a far from unpromising form . It might have been made the medium for a delightful intermixture of satire , fantasy , comedy , farce  --  nor need imagination and poetry have been entirely excluded . But nothing was further from the thoughts of Mr. George Edwardes and the band of librettists and song-writers whom he gathered round him . Most of the song-writers were clever versifiers ? W. S. Gilbert had banished forever the unspeakable doggerel which too often did duty for verse before his appearance . Bid this was practically the only merit that musical comedy could claim . Its plots were inept , and usually dropped out of sight before the first act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pieces , it was that of the individual comedians , each of whom worked up his little " stunt " with no thought of proportion or coherence . The form , in short , became the servile , if somewhat exaggerative , mirror of the higher vulgarity . The life it portrayed was that in which its purveyors delighted  --  how , then , should they dream of satirizing it ? And Mr. Edwardes is now being lauded by all his biographers for his incomparable instinct for " what the public wants " ! A more fallacious eulogy it would be hard to imagine . He gave the public what he wanted , and-never gave it a chance of seeing anything better . That his entertainments were excellent of their kind is not to be denied . What money and a certain order of taste could do for them , he did . He paid high salaries to clever comedians , and he crowded his stage with beautiful and graceful women , who were sometimes not without talent . When one compares the chorus of the modern musical play with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wonder whether there has not been a marked improvement in the average physical type of the young Englishwoman . If I can not quite join in the current panegyrics on Mr. Edwardes 's genius , it is certainly not that I am a Zaudator temporis adz , . All I say is that if Mr. Edwa , rdes had been able to conceive and create a higher order of entertainment , there is nothing whatever to show that his public would not have accepted it with enthusiasm  --  as they did the Gilbert and Sullivan operettas . By wholly omitting the factor of intelligence and invention , he forced himself to maintain the popularity of his wares by an ever-increasing expenditure upon luxurious mounting , which ended by making " musical comedy " almost impossible . If his intelligence had equalled his business sense and his eye for spectacle , he would have been far more successful than he actually was . " OUR MRS . McCHESNEY . " The dramatization of Edna Ferber 's McChesney stories , made by the author and George Hobart , if it has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so contrived as to furnish an evening 's cheerful amusement ( Lyceum Theatre ) . The managers must also be congratulated upon their choice of Miss Ethel Barrymore for the principal part  --  that of a travelling saleswoman who , because of her skill in disposing of petticoats made by a New York firm , eventually becomes a partner , and then a partner for life , of her former employer . Seldom has she been seen to better advantage . In her acting there has always been a certain colloquial quality , sprung of American soil , and here it is entirely in keeping with the role she has to fill . She is called upon to enact a Pretty , girlish widow- in the late thirties possessed of - what , in the hands of a less qualified actress , might easily degenerate , into bluffness . For she must meet buyers on their own grounds , charm them and convince them . This she does , and yet by her prettiness and grace succeeds in lifting the part into a most winning atmosphere . The- story itself is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a distance " Get Rich Quick Wallingford " and " Potash &; Perlmutter . " The usual lingo and appurtenances of salesmanship are present , also the severe crisis before the final triumph . The humor is , too , very often of the sort which has found a growing place in American plays , and merely follows the formula represented in such a remark as , " The way she gets around makes the hustle of Chicago seem like a prayer-meeting . " Only occasionally do comparisons of this exaggerated type bring a laugh , probably because it is recognized that they are exceedingly easy to contrive , once one abandons one 's mind to it . But when so much reservation is made , the play may be commended for its wholesome lightheartedness and entertaining situations . Miss Barrymore was ably assisted by William Boyd , Donald Gallaher , Lola Fisher , Gwendolyn Piers , and W. H. St. James . With this entertaining comedy , which was produced in London last spring and has met there with conspicuous success , Horace Annesley Vachell , already well and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first appearance as a dramatist . The change of metier is unusually successful . Mr. Archer , writing from London of the piece in the Nation of May 20 , said : " ' Quinneys " is easily the best play of a bad season , and even in a good season would take more than respectable rank . " Subsequent success in London and the warm welcome accorded to the play last week on its first production in NeW York at Maxine Elliott 's Theatre amply confirm Mr. Archer 's opinion . The chief merit of the play is as a study of the principal character , Joseph Quinney , a Ycrkshireman wholly without education , but become through sheer force of native talent a leading authority on antique furniture . The interest is , however , by no means confined to character . The plot is slight and exceedingly ancient  --  the love affair of an employee with his master 's daughter  --  but by means of a technical skill which is remarkable in an author 's first play the interest is sustained undiminished through all four- acts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly delineated and presents a definite personality . The plot turns on the discovery , announced by James Quinney 's foreman , that some Chippendale chairs , which Quinney has bought and resold as genuine , are clever imitations , and the old Yorkshireman immediately suspects his employee of a design to blackmail him The secondary plot , provided by the faked chairs , is dovetailed into the main love story with uncommon skill , the only weak feature being the character alluded to , Quinney 's typist , a jealous woman , who contributes , indeed , both to the development of the plot and to the exposition of Quinney 's character , but is herself a somewhat nebulous creation . It is possible that an actress of uncommon talent might raise this part in point of interest to a position corresponding with that held by the other roles , but it must be conceded that the author has set the interpreter a difficult task . - The play on the whole is excellently acted . Frederick Ross , using a broad Yorkshire accent , brings out well the essentials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' success and confidence in his own infallibility , his devotion to his antiques to the partial exclusion of more human affections . Susan , Quinney 's wife , whose meek subjection of a lifetime to her blustering lord and master is suddenly changed , when the question of her daughter 's happiness is involved , to timid but determined revolt , is cleverly interpreted by Miss Margaret Watson. - Miss Peggy Rushis altogether charming as the daughter , Posy , and Cecil Fletcher , as James , is a personable lover . Arthur Grenville is amusing in the character part of Sam Tomlin , an unscrupulous dealer in antiques and a good foil to the honorable Quinney , and minor roles are adequately played . The essentially English atmosphere of the piece may possibly prevent it from equalling in New York the success which it has enjoyed in London , but the genuine interest of the character drawing and the broad humanity of Mr. Vachell 's play should insure an appreciative reception . " Quinneys ' " is the pleasantest importation trom London which we have seen for some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is certainly hope for the future of light opera when the same early month of a theatrical season sees the production of two operettas of the calibre of " The Princess Pat " and " Alone at Last , " the latter produced last week at the Shubert Theatre . The music is by Franz Lehar , of " Merry Widow " fame , and the book is " freely adapted " from the German " Endlich Allein " by Edgar Smith and Joseph Herbert . It is improbable that any particular virtue has gone out of the piece in the process of adaptation , and it is safe to assume that for the hackneyed plot and the not very inspiring dialogue the original authors must assume equal responsibility with the adapters . The plot for itself is hardly worth recording  --  an American heiress falls in love with an Alpine guide , who is really an Austrian baron in disguise  --  but the point to notice is that the plot , whatever it may be worth , is made to shoulder the burden of carrying the piece through to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be brought to an understanding of the importance of this matter , it is probable that in tame , deprived of the aid of adventitious " stunts , " they will be driven to the composition of plots and dialogue that amount to something . Franz Lehar 's music , always tuneful and at times rising almost to the heights of grand opera , is a pleasant relief from the reminiscent insipidity of most musical comedy . It has , furthermore , the advantage of being rendered by an exceptionally capable orchestra , under the direction of Gaetano Merola , while the two principal roles are interpreted by singers of unusual musical ability , Madame Namara , who sings the principal soprano part of Dolly Cloverdale , and John Charles Thomas , who not only has a well-trained and sympathetic high baritone voice , but reveals considerable talent as an actor . On the histrionic side it can not be said that Madame Namara is particularly successful , but failure in this respect is compensated for by vocal excellence . Humor- - is supplied by Harry Conor and Roy Atwell To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must be accorded the most genuinely amusing number that we have heard in recent light opera . It bears the pleasing title " Some Little Bug Will Find You Some Day . " S. W. In spite of the excellent acting of George Nash and Lenore Ulrich , who are the protagonists in " The Mark of the Beast , " written by Georgia Earle and Fanny Cannon , and presented at the Princess Theatre , the performance may be dismissed in a few words . It is one of those dramas of sex in which the parade of the unpleasant finds no compensation in a - vital representation of life . The situations grow out of highly special circumstances , with the result that the dramatic atmosphere is anything but purged at the end ; and , besides , the construction of the play is markedly amateurish . In the same class , though of less merit , belongs " Mrs Boltay 's Daughters , " a drama in three acts , adapted from the Hungarian of Eugen Heltai , which had its opening performance on Saturday at the Comedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in age from sixteen to the late twenties , and the- oldest , - with the approval of her mother and two of her sisters , has supported the family since the father 's death by being the mistress of a rich diplomat in Washington . The plot need not be indicated further , for the play , at least in its new American setting , Seems wholly unreal and ? preposterous . The acting of Mr. Hunter and Miss Walker was much above the ordinary .
