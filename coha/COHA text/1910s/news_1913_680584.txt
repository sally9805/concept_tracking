txt Awful Ignorance About Kentucky . Kentucky is not the only State in the Union that New Yorkers should know about , though it is some State , just the same . Which reminds me that the other clay I spoke of Kentucky to two New York young ladles , incidentally remarking that both of them knew Frankfort was the capital , and to my horror and dismay they assured rue without a blush of shame that they did not know It and would have to take my word for It . The next day I spoke of this to a man born in New York and living here for forty-seven years , rather deprecating such Ignorance . And what do you think he said ? " Well , is Frankfort the capital ? I thought Covington was , do n't you ' know ? " And to make it worse he pronounced it " Coa.vington . " Is it any wonder that outside experte who come to New York to investigate our educational system do not hesitate to say it is rotten , or words to that @ @
