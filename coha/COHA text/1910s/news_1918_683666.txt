In a meeting Tuesday night the Mas- ter Barbers ' association decided that , owing to war prices of everything from cotton towels to alcohol , and the further menace of enlistment to the ranks of the journeymen barbers , prices must rise . Final action will be taken in the next meeting . In Aurora the barbers are going to raise their prices and shorten their hours ; shaves are going to be 20 tents , single massages 85 cents , and double massages 50 cents . Other prices are to remain as they are . With shaves a mustache trim will be thrown in
